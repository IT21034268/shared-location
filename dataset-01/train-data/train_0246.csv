4,Must-have accessory for yr Sony Camcorder,"A video camera without a light is like a still camera without a flash -- if your Sony camcorder doesn't come with a light built in, you need this!A couple of notes: This light is much smaller than I'd expected -- it's only about 1"" across the front by 1.5"" high by 1.5"" deep. It doesn't sound like much, but it puts out a remarkable amount of light, enough to illuminate out your subject with an even, warm light, even from nearly 10' away.The reason I can't give it 5 stars: it puts out a lot of heat, and it will cut your battery life in half (I've got the HDR-SR1). Both of these issues would be readily addressed by Sony providing an LED version of this light, but until they do, I don't think any other accessory could possibly give your videos the bang-for-buck that this one does."
3,"Great light, weak base","I love having this little light in my camera bag, but I've broken 2 of them in the last year, due to the relatively flimsy construction of the light's thin plastic base. On this video light the base is all important, as it where the power originates, and once it's broken, it's broken; time for a new one. The low cost makes it relatively painless to replace, but still.. Oh yes, how did I break it? Once by putting the camera into it's bag with the light still attached, and also by someone brushing against the camera when it was on my shoulder. It's great to have, but be very careful to put it away when you are not using it.For the future I urge Sony to create an LED version with lower power consumption, variable brightness and a stronger base, but meanwhile, it's a must-have in any camera bag."
2,Get a new light everytime instead of the bulb,"Yet again Sony has outsmarted itself, the replacement bulb costs more than the light. It lasts I believe for like 300 - 500 hours, and the bulb needs replacement. On the plus side its compact enough to remain with the camcorder but gets hot enough not to use it for prolonged periods of time."
3,Sony HVL-HLi video light,"I don't think I will be using the video light for a longer period of time. It was not very bright at dark as what was described by other buyers. It was ok. The video looked grainy during the filming. I'm thinking of returning it, and exchange it to a better one."
4,Very good,"This is a very good light for the sony comcorder i purchased. gives clear picture in dark and no need to switch your camera to night vision to make ""ghotly"" eyes!! Worth buying when you intend to use it in house or recording family get-togethers."
3,good light for about only 4ft,title says it all. its better to get flood light. my camera was sony scr82 camcorder.
1,Official word - this will NOT be released on Blu-Ray,"Today on the Green Bay Packers official Facebook page, they announced that this ""Road to XLV"" DVD set is now available. Many people commented there that they want the set to be released on Blu-ray. The Packers responded with the following comment:""We checked with Vivendi Entertainment and they stated that there is no Blu-Ray set being produced.""So there you have it. That means the product description is a lie - it says it contains the ""original network broadcasts of their thrilling four-game post-season run"". But the original network broadcasts were in HD, and you can't have HD on standard DVDs, HD can only be on Blu-ray.The NFL messed up on this one. They released the Saints ""Road to XLIV"" set on Blu-ray, and now they're going backwards with the Packers set. Standard DVDs only look good on old CRT TVs. I've tried watching them on LCD HDTVs, and they don't look good at all. I won't be buying this."
1,I've seen 6 year olds make high quality videos,"Let's ignore the fact that for some reason there is no Blu-ray available. The video and audio quality on this DVD rivals a VHS tape from 1980 that's been watched about 500 times. If these are the actual network broadcasts, then they must have been recorded with someone's cell phone while standing in front of the TV. I can't believe this is official NFL merchandise. Save yourself some money and go watch video highlights of these games for free on Youtube. You'll be much more impressed at the production value."
1,Watched all the games live in HD,Not going to purchase this set to watch them again in SD. Hopefully this stays 1 star and sells terribly.
1,Absolute Garbage,It is an absolute joke that this is not being produced in HD. I refuse to spend any money on the standard version. How can it be that both the Steelers and Saints versions from the last two years be produced in HD but the Packers is not? Everyone needs to boycott this product until they decide to unveil an HD version.
2,Please don't buy this until Vivendi fixes this,"OK, I am a Packer fan, so I sprung the cash for this. Don't follow my lead. I was stunned by the poor video quality of the Super Bowl broadcast. To say it looks like a VHS recording off an analogue source is being only slightly hyperbolic. The sound is OK, so long as you don't have it turned too high. But the picture is fuzzy and with poor detail even in close-ups. Extremely disappointing in comparison to the high quality of the ""greatest games"" DVDs. Shame on the NFL and Vivendi for releasing this inferior product."
1,Disappointed cheesehead,"NFL-Green Bay Packers-Road to XLVI read the reviews & didn't heed the warnings of the poor quality. I wanted to have a copy of the final 4 games of the season that I ignored the reviews figuring, how bad can it really be? It is like a poor copy on an old VCR machine. Why? All the people buying this are going to be upset."
1,Will not buy until blu-ray is available,"This makes no sense at all. Why would you even consider not releasing a Blu-ray version of a sports spectacle that was meant for HD? If Vivendi decided this on their own then the NFL needs to get in touch with them and TELL them ""if you release our product it has to be on Blu-ray"". Maybe when Vivendi is sitting on a few freight cars full of unsold SD dvd's they will realize their mistake (but probably not if they were dumb enough to do this in the first place). If nothing else, when they start dumping the SD discs on the clearance market for 5 dollars I might finally break down and get one if that's my only option but I'm sure not buying it now."
1,No Blu-Ray? even though the Road to SB XLIV and XLVI do,"I saw my friends discs and the quality just isn't there. This desperately needs to have a Blu-Ray version produced. I noticed the Giants Road to Super Bowl XLVI has both a DVD and Blu-Ray option as well as the Saints the year prior to the Packers run. This is unacceptable, it is the year 2012!"
1,Poor Quality,"I got this as a gift and I have to agree with many of the other reviews on here... What happened with the picture and sound quality?? The original standard definition broadcasts on my DVR look better. Granted I want to have a nice packaged and edited copy for the future. But this set fails on even the most basic levels. Wait for a fixed version.Where is the blu-ray?? Seems like Vivendi is trying to sell as many copies of this first and then make half of us re-buy the blu-ray set. If so, that is a downright scam. However seeing the rush job on this I would definitely have concerns about that version if it ever does arrive."
2,No HD!,"I agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of HD. The SD quality is average. Some of the close ups are OK but the on the field play visibility is poor quality (blurry). I wanted to wait for a blu-ray version, but when will it come? I purchased it as a Christmas present for my spouse. Really disappointing to watch from an HDTV. Sad that the NFL can't make a quality product for us. It's a slap in the face for Packers fans. They had 9 months to put this together and can't do blu-ray? Shame on the NFL!!!"
1,"No Blu-Ray, No Sale",I have been waiting for this to come out since spring and now there is no Blu-Ray? Excuse me but the games were broadcast in HD and I've been waiting to see a real 1080p Blu-Ray version of all the playoff games. I will wait until a proper release or find some other means.
4,Great Video For Any Packer Fan!!!!,"This is a great DVD collection for any Packer fan. The playoff games against the Eagles, Falcons, and of course the hated Chicago Bears all in beautiful if not perfect picture quality!!! Of course being able watch Super Bowl XLV and relive the unlikely road to a championship was the best! I have watched them all twice and I cant get enough! My only disappointment is that they are advertised as he original complete game broadcasts however, they are really the edited down versions for the NFL Network. That aside I highly recommend this DVD set, and it is a most worthy addition to any DVD collection!!!!!"
1,"No Blu-ray, no buy","Vivendi isn't going to sell many of these. DVD's are older technology that not many are looking at now. It is really amazing that a media company releases something like this broadcasted in HD and then purposely reduces to lower resolution. I guess they are showing they will be cheap in creating this kind of content. The NFL better think about contracting with someone else to sell their wares, Vivendi isn't the answer here."
1,no blu ray = no buy,"Green Bay is the smallest market in the NFL which, in the NFl's eyes, apparently justifies not even making a blu-ray version of this product. Sad and selfish on the NFl's part."
1,where is the blu-ray?,I really don't think I'm going to buy this if it is not blu-ray. I can watch the games in HD on nfl rewind on my TV. Why would I spring for non-HD?
1,No HD No Deal,"I am sorry that no HD version of the Packers Super Bowl gane will be released. It is a bad decision, one I hope will be corrected. Keep the low def DVD."
1,What are they thinking?,I don't understand this. All of these games were broadcast in high definition when aired on TV. So why are they downgrading them now by only releasing them on DVD? It makes no sense.
1,VERY PRICEY? - READ ON.,"The music is 5 star the price is 1 star.If you do buy this, bear in mind that the band do not get royalties on any of the albums until after the ""Full Circle"" album.This is not a spiteful remarks it is truth, if you don't believe me Visit Frank's website www.mahoganyrush.com and get the full story.Anyone who likes Jimi Hendrix will appreciate all the tracks on this album, but, if you look around you can find (Frank Marino &) Mahogany Rush's 1st 3 albums on a 2 CD set for the starting price of $20.43, and believe me that is even a better deal, go for the 2CD set and get 3 times as much enjoyment.I have been listening to Frank since 1973, and have met him in person, in my opinion he is one of the most underated guitarists to have walked this earth. Get to one of his U.K. gigs starting 27th July 2005, I guarantee you will not regret it, again visit the website for details!$99 for the 3rd album is a total rip off, even if you are a collector.Cornwallsteve."
5,Funniest thing since Schindler's List,"The DVD deffinately has some fun films but Silent Razor takes the cake. It's an homage to the Shaw Brothers, S/m, Samurai movies, and comic books all rolled up into one. If you like vinyl clad hotties and samurai wielding vigilantes, then this is for you."
1,Disappointing,"As soon as this book arrived I committed it to the nearest garbage bin. At least it only cost 1c for the book, and the postage was quite reasonable (and very prompt)."
2,Not a Whole Lot of Substance 2,"My wife and I were gifted with this devotional book for Christmas several years ago. Each page of this daily devotional has a corresponding worship song. The lyrics from ninety inspiring songs are offered in the book. I like that part, but the devotionals themselves are pretty weak. This book is the third book of the Songs 4 Worship series, and it would be a better fit for one of my sixth graders instead of me."
4,Good Early 50's R&B,"This CD contains 14 Chuck Willis tracks released on Okeh/Columbia between 1951 and 1954. Willis wrote and arranged almost all his tunes and featured soulfull blues numbers. The best cuts are the straight blues sides, ""Don't Deceive Me"", ""My Story"", ""You're Still My Baby"" and ""Going To The River"", and the mambo-blues number ""I Feel So Bad"". All 5 of these tunes made the R&B top ten chart. The weakest tracks are the often recorded jump blues number ""Caldonia"" which wasn't Willis' forte and ""Change My Mind"" which was an answer record to ""Going To The River"" with exactly the same melody and similar lyrics. There was little change in the Willis blues style from the 1951 ""Charged With Cheating"" to the 1954 ""My Heart's Been Broke Again"". His music was good during this period, but did not improve or evolve. The liner notes give interesting information about Willis' life but little about these CD tracks. There is no discography."
5,so proud of my brother,"I am the Barbara in the book and I couldn't be prouder to have such a great brother, he is the best. Ron came into our family and we have never regretted it ever. Just want to say I am proud of you and we all love you. The book or should I say books are great keep up the great work."
5,A great resource book for filters,A great book for filter design and analysis. This book has been a great help in understanding the detailed aspects of multiple filter types.
1,"Small print, out of date",I have several other fast math books. This one focuses too much on rules that are specific to certain numbers. The Arthur Benjamin book (Secrets...) is my first choice.
2,not worth it.,"I got this as a gift, and I was disappointed when I received it. It doesn't come in any sort of packaging, and it squeaks loudly when you try to adjust the spoon size. It was also difficult to adjust to any sort of specific size. There were some grey marks on it that were difficult to remove."
5,Bea Lillie cures cancer!,"When I first listened to this album, I thought to myself, ""Wow - I thought all the quotes by BEATRICE LILLIE on the Internet were funny - but THIS is HILARIOUS!"" After that, I became a true die-hard Beatrice Lillie fan. Now all my friends are, too! ;) I even made a life-sized paper-maiche statuette of Beatrice Lillie and proudly display it on my front porch. Also, I had cancer, real real bad and she cured it, I think. Great!"
4,Iron Thriller,"Jeremy Irons has played in good and bad movies but his acting is usually quite good. This movie is one of his better roles. He plays a husband and journalist. He loses part of his family when terrorist hijack the plane while they are going to India. He decides to go after the killers when they are released without punishment. He uses the resources of a journalist and some hints from the CIA to track them down. What he doesn't realize is he is being used by the CIA to clean up their involvement. He receives assistance from an FBI agent well played by Forest Whitaker. All in all a very good movie. Not constant action but a good action thriller with excellent production values, sets, music, and direction. If you like movies were an average person takes matters into their own hands to protect their family or to get justice, you will enjoy it."
2,"After disturbing opening, becomes ridiculous...","This movie was dropped from U.S. release after Sept. 11th. It should have been dropped for just being dumb. After a traumatic opening sequence where Irons loses his family in a hijacking, the movie spirals into unbelievable twists as Irons tracks down those responsible. Honestly, after the past few years, can anyone believe that finding terrorists is this easy? Makes you wonder what Irons and Whitaker are doing with their careers and confirms (for those who doubted) that Jason Priestly can't act."
3,JEREMY BOND?,"THE FOURTH ANGEL is a slow-moving, cerebral movie, which features Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as an avenging angel. While one can certainly sympathize with this journalist who loses a wife and two daughters to terrorists, it's hard to accept the stoic Irons in this action hero role. Director John Irvin (Ghost Story) keeps the pace efficient, but the movie loses a lot of its punch on a convoluted and sometimes hard to follow script. Forrest Whitaker uses his nice guy persona to efficiently play an FBI agent who ends up helping Irons in his quest for justice, and Jason Priestley flashes his blue eyes convincingly as an arrogant CIA agent, and we even have Charlotte Rampling in a basically useless role. Overall, though competent filmmaking is evidenced, the casting of Irons stretched my credibility a little too much."
1,Zombie Chihuahua,The quality of this bobble head is prety cheap. The neck has sharp plastic edges on it and the head barely bobbles. The paint job is horrible too. It's like Night of the living dead chihauhua. The eyes are like uncle fester from adams family. DONT WASTE UR MONEY
2,boring first season boxed set,"This first boxed set sucks. I remember the show somewhat, but these first shows are very slow. I may still buy some of the season 2 boxed sets because the series has a good foundation, and I have hopes that the later shows are better, as has been noted by others. There is one good episode in this first boxed set where the sarge has to work his way out of some town, and there are some thoughful moments in that episode. And there is another episode where one of the guys has to pretend to be a German officer, but he can't say anything because he doesn't speak German. There are some tense scenes in that one, but most of the episodes are not worth a second viewing, though. If the other seasons are really good then I would get this set just to have the complete collection, but I'm not sure how good the other seasons are going to be. The picture quality is nicely remastered though."
5,good viewing,well made world war 11 action series. they had many diverse and interesting plot lines.
5,really enjoy watching,Have not seen these in years are really enjoying watching this series and plan to get the rest of them. The shows are done really well. I say this is a good buy.
3,Combat Season 1,I last saw this series in the 60s in Rhodesia. Seems a little amateurish now however still enjoyable. The monochrome does not detract in fact even authenticates the various stories when used in conjunction with actual WW2 footage. In the 60s I never noticed the lighter side of the series. I would say that to purchase the DVD is better for a person who has already seen the programme (even if it was years ago) as opposed to a first time viewer.
2,DVD Flu,"It is great having these on DVD. It brings back alot of memories. I have several Seasons and Campaigns. My only complaint is the picture stalls and/or pixals blotch up half way into the shows. You have to stop the DVD, then hit play. Most of the time it didn't work so you just skipped to the next show. I have tried on several manufactures DVD players and the same thing occurs. Also on friends DVD players. It was all quite annoying. But I still rate it 2 stars."
3,***Beware NOT original soundtrack ***,"A Combat! article appeared on ""(...)"" (See Combat! news articles) and stated that the recorded DVD's did not use the original sound format track when recording these discs. The author states that there is the possibility of some sound degredation/distortion/whine due to the process(es) involved. Unless the DVD's are re-cut using the original soundtrack format, it is doubtful that I will purchase the current product. After all, why would you purchase a product that may have had corner's cut in production? If I receive word that they have been re-done in the proper format/manner, I will then purchase the entire set."
3,Misleading specifications,"When I originally spotted this, I saw a calculator with an Enter button, so I thought it would be a Reverse Polish Notation calculator. The picture on the Amazon site is too small to make much out. Going to the Kensington web site wasn't much help. They don't tell you much about their product.I bought it anyway and it appears to be OK.But the description on Amazon.com says it doesn't use batteries. It does. Turn it over and take the plastic barrier out before using it. That connects the BATTERY.Also the description says that the USB cord withdraws into the calculator/keypad. No, it doesn't. I don't think you would want it to. It includes a small USB cable that has a device that rolls up the cable for you.There is a similar Kensington product sold on Amazon for about the same price that has a 2-port USB hub on it. This one does not. That would have been a welcome feature. But the other one apparently shuts down without warning.So it's just OK, not great."
5,Works fine on iBook G4,"I almost didn't buy this because of the negative reviews, esp. concerning using this keypad on Macs.I got it anyway. It works fine!Yes, when you plug it in, you will get a message saying that the computer can't recognize the keypad. Just close that message box. THIS MESSAGE WILL ONLY APPEAR ONCE.The keypad works fine.I find this keypad indispensable for number-crunching on my iBook G4. I'm happy with it just for that. But it's calculator function is icing on the cake... especially when you can send the calculator's results to the document you are working on with the touch of a button.Bottom line: if you need a keypad for your computer, this is it. It works."
1,No good for my G4 Powerbook,"I kept this thing and it does work as both a calculator and a keypad. However, if left plugged in to the USB port, the battery drains very quickly. I don't move my laptop very often and wanted to be able to leave the keypad plugged in for any numeric entries I might need. By having to unplug it every time after use, and not be a heavy number cruncher, it is more of a hassle most of the time to attach the unit than to hunt and peck at the top for a few numbers. The keyboard layout is also not nearly as easy to use as the numeric pad on the keyboard that I have from an old iMac. I was able to enter numbers easily with that pad without looking but do not find the same ease of use with this unit. A great disappointment for me although I'm still using it. The power problem seems to me like an easy fix by simply adding a power on/off button, which it does not have."
4,"good, not great","This keypad definitely gets the job done. I too, get the weird pop-up keyboard message in my OS X environment. It's no bother, I just close the window and it works fine. The keys are a bit small and (this sounds wierd) slippery. I have fingernails, and they slip around on the keys in strange way. The zero is not where I expect it to be and that trips me up most often. All in all, I'm happy with the fact that it can tab and send completed calculations to a field, but it's not perfect so it gets 4 stars."
5,"Careful - same as hardcover of same name, diff cover","This is a wonderful book, but be careful. It is the same book as the hardcover that Amazon is listing as a great book to get WITH this one. They have the same title, but the cover changed with the paperback."
3,needlepoint,This book was not quite what i was looking for. The other reviews made it sound like it had a larger selection to choose from.
4,Great Read Aloud,"This is one of my faves for preschool storytime.The pictures are fun, the rhymes are natural and the surprise ending is a hoot.Karma Wilson is a great author for those squirmy 3 year olds, but her books appeal to older preschool and primary grade children, too."
5,Great book,"We have checked this out so many times from the library, that we had to get our own copy. Great book!"
4,Katie Grzywnowicz,This book is a great read for children who are beginning readers. The illustrations fill up the entire page an are vibrant and expressive. The clever rhyme of the words make it fun for students to read and listen to. All the characters have interesting personalities that shine with the illustrations of their clothing and accessories. The surprise ending will have the children roaring with laughter and surprise.
4,great children's book,"I'm a huge fan of Karma Wilson, and I'm hoping my two-year-old will be too. Ms. Wilson has a great ear for rhyme, and I always enjoy the illustrations. This is a fun book with a silly ending. Great for reading at bedtime."
2,warning: read at your own risk!,"I read this for my M.A. in History, now I know why I never read it as a undergrad. It is a bit drawn out. I like Morgan, he is very interesting and I would say the same thing about Winthrop. But like Morgan sometimes does, he draws out Winthrop's story so much that you begin to forget what the original thesis was, a people striving to be perfect in an imperfect world. Morgan's thesis would have worked much more effectively as a Journal Article in the Journal of New England History. Although, Morgan's thesis might have been ground breaking in the 1960's, it is hardly earth shattering today. I didn't feel anymore educated about Puritans than I was before. It is a good book to reflect on how historians thought about 17th century New England before the 1960's but I didn't see much use for it beyond that. Morgan has made a fine argument, it is just too bad that it was so long winded that it could have been summed up in a journal entry."
2,boring and overwellming usage of big lengthy words,I think the book was well over done. It could have been summed up in much simpler and easier terms than it was. The book did give great depth on the dilemma that the purtitans had on their travel to and in the New England colonies
1,Put on your pajamas and grab a pillow,"Having trouble sleeping? If so, I highly suggest you pick up Edmund Morgan's Puritan Dilemma. This book should be perscribed by doctors nationwide to help cure insomnia. I was forced to read this book for an American history course and I am so happy that I have finally completed it. It's not that the book was long (only 205 pages) it was just very drawn out. The essential information of the book could have easily been summed up in about 30 pages. The book did have its moments, but overall it was a major disappointment. If you are thinking of picking up this book for personal reading, please think again. Otherwise you will definitely need a large pot of coffee to keep your eyes open through this one!"
2,The Fiance,"Although this book was required text, and I am usually just a reader of novels, the book held my attention. Slow read but still rather good for being required. It really makes Withrop out like a king and mentions many things I would have never thought about.."
3,"Long, boring, But--OK","This book looked bring from the beginning, but a few paragraphs (and I do mean a few..) lifted up the story and made it interesting for the reader. Although no vivid picture was painted for me, I could still tell what was going on."
5,Works great!,It does exactly what it is expected to do. Very satisfied with how this product has worked for me and recommend it.
3,Why 3 stars?,"It's pretty overpriced for a piece of plastic. But if you like your Canon products to match, then this is the way to go. Just don't lose anymore caps b/c it adds up."
1,NO con la PRO 1,"Tengo la Canon Powershot Pro 1 de 8mp, buscando en Amazon un Lens Cap, me dio este modelo, lo mando a buscar y NO LE SIRVE a la PRO 1. Fue dinero Perdido, poco pero perdido."
5,Original and great,"I was sad when I lost the cover. I was apprehensive about the finish and the fit. But, when I got this, I knew this was the original (or 99.99%)."
3,Not Orignal,It wasn't the original cap lens. Underneath where it is says Canon it says Ultra Sonic. I was totally fooled by the pictures and everyone's comment. But I guess that's what I get for dropping my original at the pier and into the water. I guess you could say as long as the cap fits my camera lens; I am happy with it.
5,Just what I ordered,Lens cap came in new condition as stated fit perfectly on my kit lens. Hoping that I won't lose this one too!
1,I have to agree with the bad reviews,"I was a fan for years, but I've found several of Jude's more recent books to be lacking in quality. Maybe I'm just getting older and my tastes have changed, but in my opinion, she used to be much better at making the reader connect with the characters. Most of her characters lately are one dimensional and boring, and the stories aren't believable. Sad as it is to say, I'm not likely to purchase any more of her books."
1,Forever Trilogy,"I can't believe I am going to say this, but I actually want to burn these books. This is the worst trilogy I have ever read. I have read books by Jude D. before and that is why I bought the Forever Trilogy. These books have to be the worst I have ever read. I feel like a child saying this, but they are dumb. Save your time & money."
1,Just Horrible,"I used to love Jude Deveraux! This book reads like the description to a video game; they have to go here, run through this corridor, get this item... with all the warmth and depth of character of a video game, too. What happened to you Jude?DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Where is the Jude Deveraux I know and love?,"I have read and collected every one of Jude Deveraux's books. She is the ultimate storyteller, and a gifted writer. I would love to see an end to this trend of late to write ""murder, she wrote"" type stories and have her return to the heartwarming and romantic novels of her earlier style. These included ""spirits"", ghosts, angels and time travel themes - not a disappointment in the bunch!"
5,Great Book...Terrific Read,This book is excellent...but you have to read FOREVER to understand it otherwise you will be completly lost. It kept my attention until the end. You have to have an active imagination for this book and a sense of humor. Without you will not like this book.
4,"Not bad, but not great","I really enjoyed Jude's first novel in this series, Forever, except for the ending. It fell a little flat. The second book Forever and Always, jumps around too much. It leaves us asking too many questions at the end of the book. I realize there is going to be a third book, but I'm left too confused about certain people and what part they are playing in the story. If you're looking for romance try A Knight in Shining Armour, or my personal favourite Sweet Liar (there's a little bit of mystery in this one)."
1,What happened???,Jude D has always been one of my favorite all time authors but her last few books have been a total waste! I can't believe I would ever say that about a Jude D book!! With the way the book is wrote I never felt like I connected with the characters or even began to care about them. I think I'll go back and read the Lady series or the Velvet series again!
5,Research before knocking the book.,"I made the same mistake as a lot of people, started with this one first. I still got into it. Its part of a four book saga according to a couple Jude websites. People complain of no ending, because there isn't an ending. Forever and Always ended with her searching for her husband still, and she will in the next book. Forever and Always leaves you hanging wondering where her husband is. I didnt really like Lincoln. He was annoying. Its kind of frusterating being left hanging, I'd like to see her get her husband back, but I have to wait for the next books."
3,I like a happy ending...,"I don't like the ""trilogy"" format, simply because there isn't a ""happy ending"" to the book - the format makes me buy 2 more books before there is a conclusion to the story line. In the 1st of this ""trilogy"", there WAS a happy ending, the book definitely came to a conclusion. (A conclusion that I, as a reader, enjoyed reading! As a reader, I didn't even realize there would be another and another until AFTER the 2nd came out.) Yet, here in the 2nd, Ms. Deveraux tossed away that happy ending, and then tossed the readers into the middle of another mess (notice that I didn't write ""fine mess""?).I don't like her new formats. Give us more of the ""old"" Deveraux... good stories, good books, happy endings, or at least something to make the reader feel the price was justified."
4,Woah this one different!,"I saw the name Jude Deveraux on this book and I bought it with out a second thought and I'm glad I did. This is a sequel From Forever. Darcy is the Heroine in this story looking for her lost husband when Linc finds her becuase he is searching for his lost son. When I first started reading this I was a bit apprehensive because I thought that Ms. Deveraux was goin to pair Darcy with Linc. Which doesn't happen. This story was full of occult things everyting from palm readings to aliens I enjoyed it because it was entertaining there was no sexual ""scenes"" and it leaves open for another book. I personally cannot wait."
4,You Guys really didn't like this one,"I did.I found it very amusing, and not a serious story it was laughable. I like your books, this was very good. I read forever first like I hope everyone else who read this book took the time to do the samething.So Jude, now, don't let a little bad press, stop you from writing about how she finds her husband, and where is her Daddy? what happen to Lincoln? It was a cute story, but you have to do your thing on the next book cause I know how to be a disagreeable reader as well as next person. So Write away, Jude , Write away."
2,Linc ruined it for me.,I love Jude D. I even liked the first book of this series. Rememberance is my favorite romance novel of all time. The main male character in this book was simply horrible. A bundle of offensive stereotypes. Linc is the gorgeous black man with this cold hearted black girlfriend and he is secretly in love with white women. As a black women I was offended. I love romance novels Nora Roberts is great because she sticks with what she knows she is white and Irish most of her characters are the same. I love sci fi so I read Laurell K Hamilton who is female short and very pale most of her main characters are the same. I am not saying ones charcters cant be diverse but if you want to write about a character who you mostly cannot relate to at least do some research not what you see on tv and hear on the radio but talk to people.
1,Not worth the price,"I picked the book before a long flight, because I generally like Ms. Deveraux.But this one was dissapointing and weak from the beginning. The way it is written, one chapter told by Darci, the next by Linc, is interesting. But the plot is lacking in structure. Darci's psychic powers are used as an explanation of the characters' personalities, but in the end, they come out boring, silly and utterly void.Not worth the price of the book, at all."
2,Jude could have done MUCH better,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. The first book in the forever series was intriguing, suspenseful, and had just the right amount of romance. I was anxious to read Forever & Always because I thought it would be just as good if not better than Forever. Wow, was I wrong! This book was horrible! It focused way too much on racism and the story itself was choppy. I'm not sure if I'll be getting the next book in the Forever series because, frankly, if it's as bad as this one, I don't want to waste my money!"
3,Forever & Always Doesn't Live Up,"After enjoying the first of the Forever books, I was looking forward to this follow-up. However, the book did not fully live up to my expectations. Written in the first-person, the book confusingly switches from Linc's point-of-view to Darci's every other chapter. This makes following the story difficult and hard to remember who is talking. The character development is also very sketchy. However, the humor evident in the first book is also present in this one. There were many wonderful repartees between the two characters that were very funny. Obvious set-up for a series of Forever books."
3,Interesting Premise,"Forever and Always is in many ways a natural progression for Deveraux. And the storyline was, as usual, interesting to read. However, I was a bit dissapointed in the book because in many ways it read like a chap book rather than a stand alone novel. Novels in a series should be interesting to read in themselves -- in many ways this was only interesting to read because of the book that came before and what we hope will come after. I must say though, if she drags this out indefinitly I probably won't bother finishing the series/chap book."
1,What was she thinking!!!!,"Let me start by stating that I have been a die-hard fan of Jude Deveraux for over 15 years. I've followed the Montgomery's, Taggart's and every other family/book that she has written. I purchased this book at the airport thinking that I had found the ""perfect"" book to read on the 4 hour flight from Chicago to San Francisco. I had more fun staring out the window (at night)than reading this book. Darci wasn't that great a character in the first book that she was featured in. And now there is a whole book that is basically dedicated to her. The only thing that I can say about the character of Lincoln Aimes is that he is Ms. Deveraux managed to cram just about every steroetype of the African American male into the character that she could uncaring father, sex crazed, etc."
2,I LIKE DARCY A LITTLE MORE THIS TIME,"I liked her a little more this time, but still the book wasn't very good, first I don't get what the publisher review had to do with the book, and the book is really sad and it doesn't have and ending, of course Ms. D. wants us to buy the next one, but still, how more tests does she have to pass??"
1,Ditto to Blech,"Jude Deveraux is definitely a better author than this book would lead the reader to believe. The characters were poorly developed, the storyline sloppy and disjointed, and the ending was thrown together in the most implausible manner imaginable. Buy any other Jude Deveraux book--she's usually a great read. Just not this one. Shame on you, Jude! Your readers deserve a better effort for the nickel."
5,Reiki --Merlin's Magic,"I have found that I can rely on anything made by Merlin's Magic to be a wonderful addition to my Reiki Music collection! Soothing and relaxing, I love this CD."
5,Reiki merlins magic,I love all of Merlins Magic cds for I am a reiki practitioner !!am going on line now to purchase another one of his cd's
5,Good for Reiki and relaxation,"An excellent CD for reiki sessions or just relax. I also use this music for meditation. A good work of art, really."
5,Like a peaceful pool of beauty,"This CD is wonderful! No matter what my current mood is, when I listen to this CD for a few minutes, I can feel the stress and tension flow out of me. It can change my nagging thoughts to peaceful contentment. The music is beautiful and not boring like so many New Age CD's. I would recommend this CD to anyone."
5,My Dad's favorite new cup,Perfect for your Clemson fan on a hot summer day or even a cold beer in the fall. Freezes quick & keeps drinks cold for a while. Dad loves it!!
2,Awful edition,"The book gets 2 stars on the basis of the excellent (if literary rather than scholarly) text.But the edition is a ham reprint, made on the basis of an extremely rough computer scan (or xerox copy?); the rough letters dance about the page; it is legible, but headache inducing. Cheap and flimsy cover.Don't do it unless, like me, you have to."
1,Still Waiting,"How do I like it you ask? Well, I couldn't begin to tell you because the dang thing hasn't arrived yet...I ordered it on March 23, here it is May 4th and still, no music."
5,Combat rocks!,I love the Combat dvds. It brings back memories of watching it when I was younger. It's wartime but it's not graphic. It has good story lines and good characters.
3,Girls & Grease,"I just received a copy of this video from Amazon.com. Some reviewers rave about Carrie Westcott in it, but I woudn't buy it just to see this rather average blonde by ""PLAYBOY"" criteria. I have see Mason Marconi, who is also on it, but she isn't even as pretty as Carrie. As far as I am concerned, the only reason to buy this video is to see divine Cori Nadine (aka Cori Smiley in her first appearance in ""PLAYBOY"" Specials). I belong to two Cori fan clubs, but I won't join any for Carrie. I have only found one other video with her thus far :""IRONMAN"" Swimsuit Special 3 (1998). She wears T-backs and is nude in water in it, so ""Garage Girls"" gives me more of what I like with Cori nude more. The poses are a bit coy, so the movie could be improved. Still, it is well worth adding to my collection...or yours."
2,"OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED","Playboy models Carrie Wescott and Cori Nadine in a scantily-clad romp around that holy haven of man (the garage). This four-hour video has pretty girls, but as usual, you get the same old thing, nothing new and nothing dramatic. About all this movie is good for is when you want to touch yourself. It has not story, no plot, no uniformity."
2,Disappointed,"What Star Wars fan wouldn't want a Jango Blaster? It looks like a great toy, but it is actually quite poorly constructed. It has a lot of glue visibly holding it together. We had it out of the package less than 5 minutes and it broke in 3 different places! Also the screws on the battery compartment are almost impossible to remove. It does make cool, electronic gun sounds though (on the one that we could open to get the batteries in)."
3,Unexpected Problems,"Our son was thrilled when these arrived. The guns themselves make a really cool sound, very appropriate to the Star Wars series. The holster was a total nightmare and came with no ""assembly"" directions. He quickly became frustrated with that and threw it away. Since this was part of a Halloween costume in our case, we put the guns away on a high shelf so they wouldn't get lost or broken before the intended ""big day"". Strangely enough, these guns would ""go off"" by themselves in the middle of the night, or when no one was home, or when we were all in another part of the the house -- and get ""stuck"" in their sound loop cycle. In order to stop the sound (which is annoying as it repeats nonstop) someone would have to go pick them up and turn them over or move them. They'd stop then, only to ""go off"" again a couple of hours later. They ended up in the trash can as soon as Trick-or-Treating was complete!"
1,Man-sized 8-year-old Holster,"2 guns make cool sounds with 2 AA batteries each. The holster is the problem with this kit. Description says it's for 8 year olds, but the holster is fixed with velcro and is too large for my 36"" waist, let alone a child's. This will be returned."
1,One Very Large Size for Adults is what you get!!,"Be aware that this holster is made for a 34"" waist yet is sold for accessories for children's costumes!! After purchasing this, my husband altered the holster by cutting it down and riveting it to fit our 7 year old son otherwise there was no way it would work. I think this is item is very misleading!! It is also very confusing to put together!!"
1,Guns Cool Holster Huge and poorly made,"My son loves the guns, but I had to completely reconfigure the holster the leg straps barely fit around my 4 yr old and the belt is 4 times to big. The holster was a waist of money. Much velcro went ito making the holster to fit my son."
1,son is crushed,"My 8 year old paid for this with his own money. We just opened it and haven't put batteries in the guns yet, so I can't speak to them, but the holster is defective. One piece of velcro on one of the holsters is on the wrong side of the strap, so I had to twist the strap to connect it. As another reviewer mentioned, the length of the belt is just bizarre. It almost wraps twice around him, but not quite, so there's no way he can wear it. And I just checked the return policy: returns must be unopened!"
2,"Guns are fun for kids, but belt doesn't fit","My 5 year old boy enjoys the life-like sounds of the guns. Lights would make them even better.The belt at the waste is adult size, even though the size on the package shows it is small and meant for kids. I am wondering if the manufacturer mis-labelled the package.The holsters also hang really low for kids. We make major modifications to make it fit and only use one gun holster, so it will work for halloween."
1,unhappy star wars fan,"When we recieved this item we were excited, but upon opening realized the mistake.The holster is poorly made and fell apart literally within minutes. The seems didn't stick. One of the guns never made sound. We even tried different batteries thinking the ones we were using were bad. Its is sad because my son was really hoping for a fun toy. It is not and extremely overprised. Do not buy!"
1,"STAY FAR, FAR AWAY","Cheap, Cheap and still cheaper.I know its a costume, not really a toy, but this thing pushes the limits.Straps are as flexible as paperboard.They are glued on to the holsters and pull off very easily.Sized to fit overweight Star Wars enthusiast adults.Steer clear."
3,Pretty cool for cheap pistols,I bought this set for my three year old for halloween. He has played with them almost every day. The belt is way to big for him (I had to wrap it around twice just so it would hang on for a couple of pictures). The belt is too big for me (I have a size 36 waist). How fat do the chinese think we are?
2,Don't buy this toy.,"Our Jengo Fett Blasters and Holster arrived today. Within five minutes of getting it out of the package, the holsters came unglued. One of the blasters doesn't work - when screwed in, it blasts continuously instead of with a trigger pull. How disappointing!"
1,Looks great in the picture but really poor quaity,"Looked great in the picture, but fell aparat immedaitely.Bad directions to bootI should have listened the prior reviewers that warned about buying it"
1,Cheap plastic and didn't work,"The first thing I noticed was how cheaply this is made. The first gun I removed from the packaging didn't work at all, after trying several batteries. Didn't bother with the other before I sent it back.I'm going to try and find one at a local store so I don't have to deal with shipping another one back."
1,Do Not Buy,Do not buy! Do not buy! Horrible. Here are the issues. 1 gun broken and with parts loose and rattling inside. 1 gun has bent metal connector... probably will not last long. All plastic glued joints fell apart within a few minutes coming out of the box. My son was way disappointed. My son needs it for costume party so I am forced to attempt fixing it. Hot glue will not work since the holster has a weird oily residue. Not built for children. Not Safe. Nothing fits since it is designed for a large adult. The company selling this should actually feel shame for selling such crap. I failed by not reading other reviews which is my fault.
5,blaster,Great costume accessories. My grandson is a Star Wars fan and loves to dress as Star Wars characters with realistic parts. Item is great.
3,Fair,This is a good video. It is not what i expected but it is good if you like defjam artists and dont expect too much.worth the money.
4,Jeep Headlight Upgrade,"These lights are way better than a standard head light replacement.The light is whiter and brighter, much better than the factory dingy yellow looking lights.These combined with a headlight harness upgrade produce a very nice, safe light pattern for driving.Should be installed on every Jeep XJ or MJ."
2,Not so bright,I bought these headlights for my Jeep Cherokee and they are not as bright as the OEM ones I had in there. I drove 150 miles on a 2 lane highway with my lights on bright and not a single car blinked at me for bright lights --Not one ! I even spent the money to have a shop aim the headlights and they weren't that far off. I would not buy these again ! !
2,Too bright,"During night time driving, I've estimated that roughly 35% of the cars I pass flash their brights at me with these headlights. Not only do I dislike blinding others with MY headlights, I seriously dislike being constantly flashed. I've always felt bad after flashing my brights at someone only to be flashed by their even brighter brights in return. Now I'm on the other end of that and I'm not sure what to do about it.As far as quality of the actual light goes, I love them... but they seriously piss off everyone else I run into."
2,Sylvania Silverstar H6054- Worth the money?,Not as bright as expected. Little difference from the cheaper halogen headlights. I put them in my RV. Due to the cost probably other better products out there.
5,Great Lights,Purchased a set of these for my 2000 Jeep Cherokee that still had what appeared to be the origional wagner bulbs installed. Although the wagner's still worked the light they output was very yellow and dim. I was looking for a set of bright white head lights not the blue lights that hurt on coming traffic's eyes. These are exactly what I was looking for. These are much improved over the wagner bulbs. the light out put is at lest 50% greater but the white light seems to enhance your night time vision.
4,Great Lights,"These headlights are awesome, I replaced the stock headlights in my '92 Toyota pickup with these. Way brighter, can see farther down road, and can clearly see ditches on both sides of the highway. These, combined with mounted driving lights, is like driving in the day. Absolutely no problems driving at night. These by themselves are a huge step up from any stock headlight I've ever driven with. Awesome product, and very cheap. Last retail store I looked in for these was almost double the price I paid on Amazon including shipping."
2,Poor quality light or defective unit,The light is spotty. Contact customer service at Sylvania and never heard back. Not What I expected. Prior units were superior.
5,perfect fit for 1989 honda accord,"I did not realize that the headlights on my 1989 accord were completely sealed, but when i found the silverstar version of the H6054's I was very happy indeed! These are so much brighter and are a joy to use at night and in rain. Would recommend them with anybody who has the type of car that can take these."
4,Like night and day,Used these to replace my stock headlights. What a difference. Really brightens up the road a lot more than my old ones. Fast delivery too
5,GLORIOUSLY DETAILED 17TH CENTURY ITALY,An enchanting story of a boy's dream and his realization of the importance of patience takes place during alandmark period in art history.The Neptune Fountain/The Apprenticeship of a Renaissance Sculptor by Taylor Morrison recreates seventeenth century Italy in glorious detail.Descriptions of the famous Carrara marble quarries and the painstaking steps involved in creating a sculptural fountain's main figure are vibrantly authentic.
2,GREAT WHILE IT LASTS...,"I LOVED this printer!! The print quality is truly phenomenal! I had a few issues with paper sizes, too many pieces being fed through, the rear feed slot, same as other reviewers, but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful. And yes, I am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer, because it is DEAD at the ripe old age of 13 months! Exactly ONE MONTH after the 1-yr warranty, my printer is ""unfixable"". And HP won't do anything for me... after speaking to 8 people on the phone (only one of which I understood fully) and 3 supervisors, they just said that I'm SOL... So, yes, very nice printer, if it lasts."
5,Fantastic,"I am an amateur photograper at best (new to digital cameras). My photo composition is a little bit better than a snap and shoot type person. I have a desire to get better. I have two types of digital software for processing digital pictures but lacked a good printer. I purchased the Photosmart 8750 from Amazon and when I got it, I hooked it up and loaded the software onto my computer without any hassles and prepared for my very first photo. I was bowled over with the professional looking print that came out. I have since learned some new color management techniques on this printer and that same photograph now looks like a contest winner. Don't even think twice about this printer. It is fantastic. This amateur now looks like a PRO."
2,Very dissapointed,"The HP Photosmart 8750 printer seems to be very well made with some nice features. However my color ""test"" photos were very disappointing. Using HP Premium Plus photo paper and the printer set to ""best quality"" a band of lighter color would appear across the printout spoiling the print. The banding runs parallel to the print head path and starts around the last inch of the print being printed. The band varies in width somewhat but is typically .125"" to .50"" wide. I increased the print quality to the ""MAX DPI"" setting and even more banding appeared in the print. I then tried printing directly from a compact flash card pluged directly into the card slot using the same image and the print still had visible banding. I then exchanged the printer for another 8750 yesterday with no luck as I still had banding issues. The print quality would be excellent except for the banding that keeps appearing. I am returning the printer for a refund."
2,Picky about software,"The print quality is very good and set-up is simple enough, but it does have feeding problems. My biggest problem, big enough to decide to replace it, was that it didn't like to work with some software, specifically CS3 Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, all stables of my design studio."
1,Photodumb. HP 9180b,"Prints, (if they come), are OK, but off centered. Try to get this printer not to jam paper (20LB, 24LB, good gloss of any kind, through any rout. Poor programming from the IT's. Good prints-when it works, it works really slow. Others can be bad sometimes, but nothing like this HP PRO PHOTOSMART 9180B."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"Ok, after the 225.00 spent on this ALL PLASTIC door, and the 300.00 spent carving the glass out of our french door in the back to install it, our dog won't even use it! It makes such a loud noise when it slams, it freaks him out. After trying several days (which has now turned into weeks) to train him to use it, he just pushes his paw against the door, lets it slam, which scares him, and then starts crying. Believe me, after the cost of this door, and the price to install it I feel like crying along with him. To top it off, the ""infra red"" key collar is a piece of $#@&! I've gone through three of these things at 25.00 a pop, and when the last one broke, I decided to forget it. (The keys honestly look and feel like you could by them 2 for 1 at the dollar store.) I have finally decided that I'm going to have to get a different door. I just hope this one hasn't scared our dog so much, he'll never use one again! A piece of advice to you, don't buy this door. Buy something else."
1,HORRIBLE IS RIGHT!! I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS 0 STARS,"It never works for my dogs who have the collar infa-red controllers, but my cat gets out twice a day with out one!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It is a total waste of money and it will give you nothing but frustration!!!"
4,They did what they said they'd do! Good folks!,"Honesty and integrity are not in some folks' vocabulary! Thanks, people, for being my kind of folks!"
3,If you don't know how to use a word processor.....,"First of all, you need to realize that this product is for beginners. It's very user-friendly. Even if you've never had any experience with a word processor such as Microsoft Word you should be able to use this. However, it should also be noted that if you have Word you could make an end product very similar, if not better than anything you could do with these products. I look at this 10-pack as a whole bunch of templates for Word that I don't have to create."
2,disco box,"audio quality of this CD is really badsounds like bad mp3 files, especially first trackdisappointingCD is a mix CD, which Ii found annoying."
2,"good, ok, and bad","i knew it was going to be bad before even playing the cd, just by reading the reviews. but i wanted to hear it for myself. the song selection is great, not the overly common songs, and good there is 3-4 minutes of most songs. but i am still glad i have most of these on original 12 inch vinyl singles, including the bryan adams song.and yes, it appears to be originally mixed for continuous music, but my copy has VERY annoying sudden silent breaks between each song. i wonder how many generations away from the original cd my copy might be.overall it has a very muffled sound, and as mentioned by some, an annoying loud clicking sound during the final third of the cd, which is sharp and crisp, against the muffled sound of the music.and, the track listing is off, there are two additional songs not listed. i am curious about some of the other volumes in the series, but not sure what i will end up with in quality"
4,Somebody gave me a copy.,"Somebody gave me a copy of this cd, So I don't have the album, but it's good music, my favorite tracks are:Contact, Mandolay, Turn The Beat Around, And I love music. pretty good stuff."
4,A great Cd!,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase this CD due to the numerous negative reviews it had. I wanted the recording of Bryan Adam's recording of Let me Take you Dancing. Well upon playing the CD I was pleasantly surprised that the recordings were very clean and crisp. I didn't have any of the sound distortions that some other reviewers experienced with their CD's.The only drawback is that the song ""Let me take you dancing is not the full length version, other than that I am happy with this Cd. Buy it, take a chance and ""let Bryan take you dancing""!"
3,Naruto chain,This is a great product if your naruto fan however the the neckless broke easily but the pendant is great.
4,Pretty Good,The necklace was an ok purchase; it came well displayed in a nice tin box and it was a good gift. The only problem is that the pendant itself is a little thinner than I had previously expected but overall it didn't negatively impact the product as a whole. Great gift for friends that are into Naruto.
4,"i like kakashi, so i got this one.","The pendant looks nice and shiny. No need to say, the Sharingan design is cool, and it got my friends surprised. But the chain is easy to be broken - the only downside. Highly recommend."
4,A hit with Naruto fans,My nine-year-old son LOVED this necklace. He had one last year but lost it and was thrilled when he got another for his birthday. Big hit!
4,"A very entertaining and educating book, well worth reading.",A Passage to India captures your imagination of what a Brittish ruled India might have been like. The characters are very well rounded and very entertaining with their different ideas about life.
5,WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MISS QUESTED IN THE MARABAR CAVES?,"This tantalizing question provides the intense drama at the centre of Forster's last and greatest novel, which explores racial tension in colonial India.After a mysterious incident during their visit to the Marabar Caves, the charming Dr Aziz is accused of assaulting Adela Quested, a naive young Englishwoman. As he is brought to trial the fragile structure of Anglo-Indian relations collapses and the racism inherent in colonialism is exposed - a theme which still has powerful, dangerous realities today."
4,E.M Forster's indictment of Imperialism,"Set in the British colonial outpost of Chandrapore, this novel begins slowly ,examining the complex relationship between the British community and the native Indian population. The underlying arrogance and prejudice of the club membership Brits is established early on through the eyes of two newly arrived women who are insistent on seeing the ""real"" India. They have stepped into a situation that they don't quite understand and the delicate balance of the community is nearly shattered by events which occur during an innocent enough day trip to a nearby attraction.Forster's book is a serious fictional account of how people of different backgrounds can live in close proximity but still have little understanding of each other when the cultural divide is kept intentionally wide. One of the better novels I've read on the subject of British Imperialism."
3,Interesting But With Limited Appeal,"I picked up E.M. Forster's classic work as just something to read while on a trip. Having not seen the movie nor knowing anything about the novel other than the recommendations of others, I was surprised and at the same time disappointed. While I enjoyed the details of period India and the basic plot of the book, it was a bit of a slow read for me. Some classics don't hold up well to modern times. Why I can't say. This is a great but somewhat dated book. I'm sure anyone interested in history and period locals will find A Passage To India much more appealing.BJ NeblettElysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present"
2,Boring but has a point,I was required to read this book for a summer reading list and I dreaded going back and continuing to read it. I understand why it is required because of the cultural points but I cannot say I enjoyed reading it. I read certain chapters then i would read the corresponding spark notes and it would make a lot more sense. Good luck fellow summer readers! :)
4,India,I think this book was great. It shows the way life was in India during the British control. It was good. It couldnt of been more correctly writen. Forester was a great writer that captured the essaence of india.
3,A Good Twist then a Weak Ending,"Forster's classic is yet another one of those books I probably would not have read save for its selection by my bookgroup. For a good half of the book I was fully expecting a nicely written standard story of colonial injustice. Thankfully, the story turns a different way and is thus saved from what at the time might have been controversial, but now is merely banal commentary. Forster's writing is decent, and he did a really good job of conveying the psychologically confusing aura of the place. However, the ending is very weak and oddly done compared to the rest of the book. I'm glad I read it, but I don't foresee reading much else by Forster."
2,Expected More,"This having been praised as one of the great works of literature, I thought I was in for something more enriching. I did enjoy some of the images Forster paints, as in the scene in the mosque where Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore first meet Aziz, and some moments of light humor, such as the scene where Aziz lends Fielding his shirt pin (or whatever it was) and Ronny later uses this against him and his culture.However, I just can't recommend it. I really tried to like it. Perhaps I've played too many video games, but it was just extremely plodding, and the dialogue was not interesting enough to justify its length. It's a shame because it's books like this that make me shy away from reading more ""classic"" literature, some of which I really love, but some disappoints me as Passage did. The good news is I tend to stay up a lot later that I should and this helped me get to sleep early on numerous occasions."
1,A below average novel.,A Passage to India is a great book for those of you with insomnia. It put me to sleep when I tried to read it. This novel is really boring and utterly dissapointing. Forsters style of writing is very detailed and his vocabulary is very exqusit but I found A passage to India to be very unexiting and not worth my time. After reading the first 2 pages of this thing I alsmost puked. Maybe for some they might find this interesting but for me its caca.
1,a waste of time,"i can not believe people consider this book good literature. i am ashamed of the time i wasted reading this book. the plot is very very slow, and if you think the second half of the book will improve, i am sorry to say it doesn't. this book does a pathetic job with sybolism and theme. i hated this book. please read something else if you are considering reading it..."
2,Very confusing,"I had to read this book in 10th grade for my history class and it was one of the worst, most confusing books that I have ever read in my entire life. For one, it was very difficult to understand who was talking because Forster's narration was incorrectly phrased, in my opinion. Secondly, all types of foreign vocabulary was introduced to me, and lastly--Forsters whole way of writing was just too complex. Then to add to all this, the story was not interesting at all. Who (but boring people, of course) cares about those boring people anyway. Maybe I didn't like the book because it was so difficult and I was not grasping the deeper meaning behind it. All I know is that this book was certainly not my cup of tea."
1,OU-BOUM,This book threatens meaning badly.DONT BUY THIS BOOK. NOW !!!(too bad it isnt possible to give less then one star)
3,About Forster,"One reviewer mentioned that Forster probably never visited India. This is untrue...as he visited the country at length several times. His fascination with India started when he was a private tutor to an young Indian man that he fell in love with...his feelings were not reciprocated, however. He later went on to visit India because of those feelings. Just FYI."
4,The classic story telling,"British raj and the their social life in India told beautifully, good story, good story telling. Classic literature. Like it"
3,Colonial British Racism,I almost gave up on this one because almost nothing happens for the first 150 pages and the prose is extremely dry. The author paints a very precise portrait of racism and class-ism in British occupied India.It is easy to see why so many people hold this book in such high regard; it was obviously groundbreaking when it was published. It will never take the place ofTo Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)in my heart.
2,Passage to India,"This was part of my bookclub and I found it to be a gruelling experience. I did not like the character, but I did find ou there were more Muslims than Hindus which was surprising. I found not one charater I liked"
1,Not for me,"I think this is the first book I have EVER put away without finishing. I'm an avid reader and will read almost anything, but this was just too slow for me. I barely made it through about 3 chapters. SNOOZER!"
1,Forster makes a big mistake,"Forster writes this book taking the history of India for granted. He does not cater to the needs of his western readers, rather, he tries to portary a short event in Indian history. This book leaves India misunderstood-to the western reader-and makes an Indian angry."
1,Hugely disappointing,"How could a novelist with as high a reputation as Forster take such a major theme and make so little of it? British rule in India and its consequences constitute one of the most interesting and important aspects of world history. It is strange, therefore, that British novelists have rarely tackled the subject. But if this is the best they can manage, then it's probably no bad thing. Forster has no insight to offer on the nature of colonialism; how it affects the characters of the exploiter and the exploited; on the nature of racism; on conflicts of culture; or, indeed, any of the major themes suggested by a subject such as this. None of the characters seem fully realized, and the Hindu festival in the final part of the novel seems to me particularly embarrassing. Perhaps it's time that novels written in Indian languages were translated into English: they are bound to offer more insights than this hugely disappointing book."
2,Disappointing,"This book never grabbed me the way I had hoped it would. None of the characters is particularly engaging, and indeed some are barely tolerable. This is a 360 page book that reads like a 600 page book. I'm not what you'd call a plot-junky, but this book was just too slow and too boring. There are only three or four memorable scenes in the whole book, and only one of them possesses any dramatic tension. I think Forster set out to make a statement about relations between colonial power and colonized people. Certainly he accomplished that, but then again he could have done it in a page or two. Instead he threw together a mediocre work of literature to demonstrate his point."
1,Sections Missing,"A great book, but this version is marred by far too many typographical errors; moreover (and what's worse), entire sections are missing!"
2,excellent book; poor Kindle edition,"I won't add to the other positive comments about this book. It's wonderfully written. But the formatting on Kindle is deployable. In particular, the paragraphs breaks are hard to discern, making it difficult to know who is speaking.I hope the publisher will update the book to make it a better Kindle read."
5,Thought-Provoking,"I have always been a fan of E.M. Forster. His ability to understand the way that society and humanity works has always managed to astonish me. This work is thought by many to be the greatest that he ever wrote. I tend to agree ""Howards End"", ""A Room with a View"", and ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" were stepping stones to this novel. The story is simple. A man is accused of doing something his friends believe him to be innocent all others believe him to be guilty. Yet, the story is not at all simple. It explains how horribly off things in India were when Britain still maintained an empire there. That man accused is an Indian. The person accusing him is an English woman. In these two characters, Britain and India are made real. The reader sees how wrong the whole situation was . Be prepared to leave the book angry at the British for doing what they did in India. Read and learn this book!"
3,Conflicted,"I'm seriously conflicted about this book. Is it a masterfully told tale of complicated characters and compelling moral conundrums and gray areas? Yes. Intellectually, I appreciate it very much. But . . . I just. don't. like. it. And mostly I don't like it because I couldn't help feeling that Forster didn't much like it either. He wrote his characters, even the sympathetic ones, with borderline disdain. It's rather a grumpy book, for all its brilliance, and so I find I'm as glad to be done with it as I am to have read it."
3,Not Forster's Masterpiece,"E.M. Forster is definitely an artist, but in A Passage to India his artistry falls short of the mark. As in all of his novels, the themes of this book are both timely and yet eternally relevant; however, the composition of the story doesn't live up to the standard he set with Howard's End. The echoes of Forster's philsophical standards are here, but there is a sense of cynicism and hopelessness that obscures the moral value of the book. Whereas in A Room with A View Forster managed to stamp the entire novel with a certain ideology through a few well phrased and placed passages, A Passage to India is more of a ""muddle"". And while that metaphoric fog adds to the picturesque effect of the story, it makes the thematic elements more obscure and less open to the reader.This book is good, as far as the story goes, but Forster could and did do much better."
2,"Pretentious, overrated and boring","How this book, and Forster's work in general, can be so highly rated by critics who actually appear to be intelligent at the expense of genuine geniuses of the time like Joyce, Huxley is amazing. Just because I find something dry and boring doesn't mean it isn't great literature, but this does not apply to Forster, who is dry, boring, shows no psychological insight whatsoever, has wooden, unrealistic characters and dialogue and very few redeeming features at all. This novel has been described as ""enchanting, epic and profound""; if you've heard this and are thinking of buying it then you should direct your attentions to Joyce's ""Finnegans Wake"", Huxley's ""Point Counter Point"" or T.S. Eliot's poetry, all of which are far superior to this aristocratic, narrow sighted rubbish."
2,one too many sweeping epics,"This book is written with 4 different narrators. I liked the voice of the first, but could not get past the second. One more book labeled as a wonderful classic that seemed better in memory of other people than in my actual reading. I sometimes think the label ""classic"" is some kind of joke played by English teachers; so many ""great books"" are so universally disliked."
2,disappointing,"This story is light, funny and adventurous. Unfortunatly it is written in a very heavy hard-to-read manner. Very uninviting - had to force myself to read it."
2,"A classic, and very tedious","This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason."
1,"Too long, Descriptive, and Uncreative","I honestly wish I had never read this book, a tremendous waste of my time. Of all the ideas Forster could have come up with for a novel he chose... the relations of Indians and Englishmen. Very dissapointing, never caught my attention."
3,I miss Bob Murphy already,"I bought this CD just to hear some of Bob Murphy's great calls over the years. (After all, isn't that why most Mets fans might want this CD? Or is it that you're just dying to hear ""Bad to the Bone"" for the umpteenth time?)Anyway, the disc features a lot of the more famous calls, including the '86 ones (although you almost have to admit that Vin Scully's TV call of the game-ending Buckner error in Game 6 was better...), but the rest of the CD contains too much (bad) music.But until they put out a CD of just Murphy himself, this'll have to do."
4,My Favorite Brautigan Book of Prose!,Richard Brautigan was crafty. I read once that he wanted to write the perfect poem and that poem would be about the shortest period of time one could imagine. That poem would be one word. Nobody has ever heard the word yet. It hasn't been created. Everyone knows what it means. We've always known. If you are buying your first Brautigan book I highly reccomend starting here and finishing when you own everything he's written.
2,Comedy Mistake,This was the worst Comedy standup DVD that have bought. All the comedians were dreadful with the except of the Haitian guy. The review that said you will either love it or hate it... might be right~ Hated it :(
3,Michael Colyar,Michael Colyar is the only reason why I bought this and yes he does delivers but the rest no. Not their finest moments. I wish I could just find a whole comedy tape of Michael Colyar only
2,A Time To Revenge,"The producers made this movie a sort of catchall for all interest, althought classified as a modern western. It includes some adventure, romance, music, violence, and yes--sex. Although it bears an ""R"" rating, I presume it must be for theme. I had a little trouble stay tuned . Found in the bargain bin, as low budget movie, pick it up if you like and give it a try."
3,"Hampson is as great as Fischer-Dieskau, and just as wrong for Verdi","Greatly talented singers are justified (almost) in believing that they can sing anything. In his native Germany Fischer-Dieskau sang, and sometimes recorded, roles like Rigoletto, but his voice wasn't right. No amount of artfulness can turn an Isolde into a Pamina, or in Thomas Hampson's case a fairly cerebral American into a red-blooded Italian. Hampson sounds out of place in every aria here, even though his voice owns all the notes.He strains and pushes to sound macho, if not exactly passionate, and as a result the melodic line becomes forced. Verdi depends above all on naturalness. Hampson isn't convincing in moods of rage, revenge, defiance, or tragic sadness. Nor is he helped by filling this recital with obscure arias unknown to all but the most specialist opera collectors. Strangely, he decided to make a follow-up Verdi recital due out this summer. Sorry, but this one is a miss."
2,Not Actually Helpful To A Parent Looking For Answers,"The book gives great examples of rivalry in different forms, practical reasons why there may be more rivalry in today's home, [i.e. fewer siblings, divorce, and remarriage] and even stories of people who have overcome their rivalry. However, it does not give any advise to parents on how to alleviate or even prevent rivalry. Actually, the book seems to say that rivalry is something that just happens with or without any provocation or outside influence other than the other child. Okay, as a parent I know that I should not compare my children, but how do I give praise to one without the other feeling less than?"
5,"ARTISTIC, MOVING IMAGES","Images such as those found in ""Viennese Types"" render words superfluous. Capturing a time long past, a serene turn-of-the-century Vienna, Dr. Emil Mayer has preserved street scenes perfectly representing individuals often seen, such as sidewalk vendors, window shoppers, a scissors grinder, a carriage driver, and more. All of these photographs are artfully composed, beautifully rendered. Most amazing, perhaps, is the intimacy and sympathy these images convey. It is almost impossible to view them without being moved.Born in 1871 in Bohemia, Dr. Mayer was a Jew who was the victim of Nazi oppression. Following his suicide at the age of 66, his possessions, including his photography collection, were lost. Thus, regrettably, little is left of his great work.Nonetheless, ""Viennese Types"" is mute testimony to his photographic artistry. This is a rare volume, one to be treasured."
4,Its exactly what I needed...,"This is a good basic wall mount. It's mounted to a single stud and comes with everything you need. My only gripe is that it sits very close to the wall, so adjustments after a 32"" panel is attached is impossible. The gripe is also a good thing however....it keeps the unit close to the wall so it doesnt stick out too much.If you have a stud that is at the perfect place for mounting a screen, this is a good, low cost option. If you need some flexibility to move the set left or right of a stud, look for a different option."
4,adapted to fill need,"this mount was needed to replace the plate on a mount that was originally bought 2 years ago. i bought a peerless wall mounti believe it was pa-740, anyway the tv that i used it with required the small vesa bolt pattern ( 100x100 ). so all of the extra parts were tossed or misplaced. since this was the same brand, i chanced that i could use the plate with the older mount and it worked. this way i able to bolt the plate to the new tv with the larger vesa pattern ( 200x200 ), and then attach it to the wall mount."
5,Awesome Mount,"This mount fits very close to the wall, which is what I wanted. It can be a tight fit when installing but that is to be expected when you are trying to mount it so close to the wall. I bought two of these and do not regret it. Good build, durable, and easy to install with multiple options to fit multiple TV's."
1,English major he is not,"If chapter 19 is representative of this work, good luck with the reading. I actually had to edit parts of the chapter to understand what I hope is the author's meaning. The text contains absolutely horrid grammar and excessive inappropriate punctuation. The content appears good but the text is so difficult to understand you are better off with another source. The fact that Amazon misspelled the authors name ought to give you a hint about the worse to come."
4,Quality Issues - UPDATE,"This chair is comfortable, but I definitely not satisfied with the quality. I received it as a gift 5 months ago and have used it occasionally INDOORS ONLY, so no exposure to extreme temperatures or sunlight. One of the elastic cables that support the mesh snapped, leaving me with a useless chair. I am a reasonably large guy at 200 lbs, but give me a break. They have been making chairs for over 50 years and they can't figure out how to make a quality elastic cable? So now I can either drop $30 on a replacement cable that will probably break as well or throw a $140 chair in the trash!Update: Good customer service resulted in my getting a replacement cable for free. This one has held up better - so perhaps I had a faulty one before."
5,Worth every penny!,"These are SO comfortable! I have a bad back and I wish all my furniture felt this good. I want to bring it into the house during the winter! The only ""bad"" thing I can say is it's a little bit awkward to get in and out of. I place my feet on either side of the foot rest to sit down or get up. Hubby and I both love them. Great for sitting on the deck enjoying our morning cup of coffee or laying back and watching for falling stars! The mesh is nice and cool and the padded armrest is comfortable on the arms. Nice and lightweight so it's easy to move around. I think the weight limit given is on the high side. If you weigh 250 or more I'd suggest going to the larger size chair."
2,Not great,"I'm 5'9"" and found this was too short for me. It was uncomfortable. Maybe the XL would have been better"
5,"Love, love, love it!",Great chair. Once you get in it you never want to get out. Had to buy one for my hubby too because he wouldn't get out of mine. We are taking them on vacation with us too. Worth every penny.
4,Poor delivery,"The LaFuma zero gravity chair was delivered. The shipping company ( can't remember which carrier) left the large box in the middle of the driveway by the gate, instead of bringing it in to the house, blocking access to my house. One visitor was not able to get through as she was not strong enough to move the box. It rained. I managed to kick, drag the box out of the driveway but not into shelter. It remained in the rain all night. I also noticed that the box was damaged at one end. It stayed in the rain for 24 hours or so until someone strong enough to bring it in. We unpacked it, and the chair did not seem to be damaged, so I am not returning it. It is very stiff, however, compared to my old Travel chair. Does anyone know if it can be adjusted? The locks are off. I have a bad back. Getting out of the zero gravity position actually stresses out my low back as I have to lunge forward with too much force. Hope it loosens up with use. Other wise it is good."
1,piece of junk,"This thing arrived in a ravaged box. It may have been damaged during shipment. When you sit in it it bends inward and your butt hits the metal support bar below the seat (no, I'm not fat). Try to recline and your are tossed onto your back, staring at the ceiling. There is no halfway with this contraption. you're either fully upright, or you're counting stars. There is supposed to be a lock under the chair arm, but it did not work. It is a French product...what did I expect?"
2,not as good as I hoped,"The author drips elitism and has a clear dislike for the private ownership of firearms in the United States. That's what put me off initially, but the real problem is that the book contains very little actual tracking knowledge.Boiled down: One guy tracks, two other guys cover his ass. Try to catch up with and shoot whomever it is you are tracking. (like one of those ""rogue American gun owners"")The book was way overpriced for what it contains. The cover is very exciting."
3,An OK Book,"The overview of Egyptian movies is good, and it discusses some of the classic movies produced by Egypt's moviemakers but it never really produces a ""feel"" for these movies. The bios of key people in the industry is helpful, but overall it just gives you a feel that it has a lack of substance. It might make a good companion book if studying the genre from the outside."
2,"As Much Star Power as ""Outbreak."" Significantly Less Plot","Everyone has already brought up the star power of this movie so there's no point in mentioning it again, but what I will say is that it doesn't hold a candle to ""Outbreak,"" a similar movie with a similarly impressive cast.""Contagion"" lacks any sort of a clear story line and becomes more of a playbook for the government if a virus were to spread across the country. Every major plot point occurs extremely abruptly and when the movie is suddenly over, you'll be left with more questions than answers.This isn't to say ""Contagion"" is a terrible movie, it just had the potential to be so much better than it is. It is a rental at best."
3,WELL DONE BUT COLD,"CONTAGION is a compelling and chilling docudrama, a cautionary tale of fear and paranoia, interspersed with personal subplots. Director Stephen Soderbergh's intent is somewhat vague---is the movie a political statement or a narrative personal drama? Unfortunately, the personal storylines aren't fully developed enough to warrant involvement. Many questions are left unanswered and two of the movie's name stars die rather quickly, although Gwyneth Paltrow's demise is fully explained by the film's finale. Most of the performances are effective---Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law---but I felt Marion Cotillard gave little to her role. Jennifer Ehle as the courageous doctor impressed me the most. John Hawkes did well in his very small role.CONTAGION is a well-done film but its clinical approach didn't elicit an emotional response."
2,Not very well done,"This movie was simply not ""fleshed out"" enough. There simply wasn't enough movie to the movie. The acting was ok but the script was simply lacking. I don't really regret the rental but just barely. Not a very good movie and one has to question how they got the talent pool involved in this movie to participate. Paltrow and Damon have both appeared in a couple of ""stinkers"" in the past but it seems like Damon especially is on a roll as far as being involved in sub-par movies go. Perhaps his disenchantment with the performance of his political Demi-God, Obama has warped his ability to choose decent roles to participate with. Who knows? Perhaps the film makers just threw enough money at both Paltrow and Damon to make them not care what they lent their names to.Not a very good movie at all."
1,Clearly a NWO film....,"If you're looking for a film high on NWO themes and low on critical thinking and plot .... you've found it. For example -- One of the ""bad"" guys questions the government and sells patent (fraud) medicine thru the internet. You can find much higher quality entertainment anyday."
1,UltraViolet Digital Copy is THE WORST,"The Movie is good. BUT: the UltraViolet Digital Copy is THE WORST GIMMICK.- One cannot import it to iTunes- The file works only with Flixster UltraViolet program you have to install in your computer- so, it creates its own database which clutters your machine- it requires you to register, invent new parole, give TWO answers to TWO secret questions = waste of time plus further spreading you personal infoUltraViolet DigiCopy TWO THUMBS DOWN!"
2,Disappointing.....,"I was so looking forward to this movie. A big disappointment. Paltrow was her nasally self and looked and sounded exactly as she always does in every movie I've seen her in even though she was supposed to be sick, and in one scene, dead (sorry, fans). Kate Winslet was absolutely believable as a physician and flu victim. This movie was a big waste of her time and talent. There wasn't a crumb of suspense or information about what was going on you couldn't learn from Henry the Hand. Matt Damon should deny any involvement and sue for use of his image. I truly didn't get the point of this movie...Zero plot, zero thrill, zero info, zero everything."
2,Too slow,"The promo was better than the movie. I thought the storyline took too long to understand, by the time I figured it out the movie about half over. In my opinion, there's nothing special with this movie."
3,"film not so engaging, but I especially liked (SPOILERS)","that so many great actresses were the first responders to the epidemic; smart, capable, highly educated and trained women characters - lovely. The soundtrack didn't totally suck, which was nice. Disliked the opportunistic Jude Law character, but probably most people did. Most of the acting was good."
3,Highly overrated,Not really compelling at all. Very little backstory and characters were well developed so you didn't really care about them at all. Terrible waste of a great cast.
1,Let down,"While I didn't see this particular blu-ray version of the film (caught it on TV) I was completely let down by this movie. I've recently gotten back into the zombie/infection/end of mankind genre. And this movie just seemed to have such good potential, but never really seemed to deliver. I think it suffered from too many side stories and didn't develop any of them fully."
2,Meandering,"I was hoping this might be Resident Evil minus the zombies and mutants, but it was really that minus pace or any connection to the characters. With poor direction and editing, the movie was choppy with many unexplained loose ends."
2,routine disaster movie,"routine disaster movie, another in a long, long series.By the nature of the disaster, don't expect special visual effects (as when the disaster is a fire, flood, tsunami, volcano, earthquake). So all you see if sick people and people who are try to avoid them."
2,Good Actors horribly put together,This fealt like somebody couldn't decide if they wanted to do a documentary or a thriller. Had high hopes and found that he acting was great and there was lots of talent just was not pulled together.
2,The time just flu by....,"This is a very silly film bejewelled with stars of Hollywood who go through the motions for their cool millions. I really do mean 'motions.' Excremental acting matched slightly by the usual directing-by-numbers from Soderburgh, which followed a daft screenplay exhibiting the usual Hollywood cliches and stereotypical characters.Why waste money on this claptrap when you can commute by train or bus and spend an idle hour or so watching those morons who insist on yawning or coughing without covering their mouths?"
2,very slow and very boring,"If you think this movie is going to be some kind of thriller, action, or apocalypse film you will be very disappointed. I understand that they tried to take a realistic point of view, and make it into a clever plague movie, but they did not have to make it so boring. It is not a typical plague movie, I thought it would be more entertaining. I can't even remember that much about it and I watched it a week ago it was that boring and I typically never say this about a film."
3,"Viruses, scientist, countrymen!",I was a rather disappointed with this film. I expected more of someone like Soderbergh. It is not enough to gather dozens of excellent actors to make a good movie. It is not because I am a virologist that I have this mild reaction but the film lack a solid story and the details about the scientific search of the nature of the virus and a protecting vaccine is superficial. Further development on the origin of the immunity of one of the protagonists is also lacking for the comprehension of a general public.
4,Reminiscent of Traffic,"The understated drama that results from the documentary technique makes for a movie that isn't immediately entertaining. However, like Traffic, I'll find myself watching it again and again."
2,Meh,"Painfully slow....great cast, but boring, very boring.Moral = don't eat a pig in Asia that ate bat poo!"
3,"A Modern Day version of ""Outbreak""!","I was particularly drawn to this movie by the stellar cast lineup. Kate Winslet, in particular, rarely appears in a poor movie.This is a good thriller, capturing the fear that can quickly spread globally when a virus unleashes itself on the world. There's good suspense and action, however, there's a lack of quality character development which lets the movie down. This is an inevitable consequence of having too many stars in a 100+ minute movie.I actually preferred the 1995 movie ""Outbreak"" starring Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo and would recommend this to anyone who particularly enjoys these types of thrillers.Overall, ""Contagion"" is very watchable and worth a night in in front of the screen."
3,"Good topic, rather clinical treatment","Plagues will be with us for a while, medicine has a long ways to go. So kudos for making a movie on the topic, kudos for covering most of the bases, kudos for using good actors and getting them to deliver largely very good performances.As other reviewers have pointed out, the movie has a bit of a documentary feel; it is just a bit like reading a spreadsheet with some human touches added. It is an interesting approach to give views from different perspectives, but as a story it is a bit sterile.Compare with the original Night of the Living Dead: information about the plague is still conveyed, via radio broadcasts and humans telling stories; but the view is very much from people who don't know what is going on, and have No Way Out. That central inescapable fear is sadly missing from this otherwise very competent movie."
1,crap don't waste your money,rotten crap waste of money story is pathetic and all acting is as lame and boring as it can get
1,If you like a drawn out affair with a Hollywood leftist PC message,"The cast of this film seemed impressive. I thought it perhaps was not just another end of the world type film. After seeing the first 10 minutes I was suspecting this to be about a needless global disaster caused by either the military industrial complex, evil conservative government, global warming, or the other usual suspects in the land of Hollywood fantasy. If only we had not driven all those SUV's, etc. Without giving the end of the movie away, after suffering through the entire affair (which I spread over three nights as kept losing interest)I found I was...exactly right! The political hit is delivered at the end, for those who actually last that long!Avoid this unless you think that these types of fantasies are true. Sadly, Matt Damon is best in action movies, not those that try to make a far fetched political claim with no science to support it..."
1,Propaganda from Big Pharma,"Contagion is another particularly disgusting example of Hollywood and Pharma pandering in public fear to sell tickets and inoculations, respectively.If you want fearmongering, here you go- but why wreck your nice immune system?"
2,Contagion,"A brilliant biologist and the hard working CDC are working around the clock to come up with a vaccine for the dying masses.They finally succeed but they're worried about getting the vaccine to the slaves. A Doctor says, ""Homeland Security wants to know if we can put a vaccination in the water supply, like Fluoride, cure everyone at once"".Near the end of the movie they explain everything to us. A bat drops an infected piece of fruit eaten by a pig who was slaughtered by a butcher. The butcher shakes hands with Gweneth Paltrow then Gweneth gives it to the guy she was having sex with in Chicago. Then Paltrow travels to Hong Kong and coughs on people there and comes home to her husband, Matt Damon. Damon has nice hair and perfect teeth and some sort of super built in immunity so he doesn't die. At the end of the movie they play a song by Bono."
4,A primer on surviving biological disaster,"It's understandable that this movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews, as it moves slowly and jumps around alot. I was lucky that I got to watch it the first time without interruptions or distractions. Lose yourself in the story and you've got one of the better surviving collapse of society type movies that has been made in a while. Very realistic.Fans of societal breakdown movies (Children of Men (Widescreen Edition),Savior) will find a lot to like in this movie."
3,186 min vs 106 min,I recently purchased Contagion from an electronics store. However upon returing home I noticed movie runtime is 106 mins. Amazon's listed runtime is 186 mins. Both versions are listed as PG-13. I've searched online for any information and found no results. Can anyone help with this discrepency?
5,Contagion,Great movie. Upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray. Big differance from dvd. Picture quality as well as sound as amazing
5,Better than the Reviews I read,"I wanted to see this movie but was a bit hesitant after reading the reviews, but decided to give it a try. It ended up being a very good movie, esp. during the times we currently live in where something like this subject matter could really happen....then what?"
5,Great movie,This movie was really good and I would definitely recommend it. It's suspenseful and it has a good ending. Very much enjoyed.
3,"Well made, but it's more like a docu film, not even a docurama","The premise of the movie is good, so was the effort to bring dramatization. Although each individual segment could be a seed for a full length movie, in total, the movie fail to be one movie. Some may find it appealing and artful, I found it lacking to be what I can naively term ""movie-ness."" The casting was great, so was acting. The suspense was there, but what I experienced is not a beginning and an ending of a movie, rather explosion and disappearance of a movie with much prospect. In other word, to me, the movie started as a solid piece, then got diluted. Pass, you won't miss much."
1,Ultraviolet is a deal breaker,"I'd love to buy this movie, but I refuse as long as the digital copy is ultraviolet (UV). When will these people learn that UV is useless, unfriendly, and a waste of time. The only proven way to deliver a digital copy is with the iTunes compatible Digital Copy. With that you can watch it on your iPhone, iPad, computer, TV. No downloading. no streaming, just a real copy of the movie you just bought.As soon as this and any other UV movie makes the switch, I'll be happy to buy it."
1,Contagion,"Movie is simplistic and story line is alarmist. In a word....it was a waste of money. Although I like Matt Damon, he can chalk this one up as a big mistake. Forget it."
2,"Too slow, wait and rent",I could not wait to see this movie based on the premise and previews. So upon release I tried desparately to rent it through my Blockbuster mail account and the local store and could not get a hold of it. Finally decided to buy it and it was not worth the money! Very slow moving story. Very little action. Great cast but I wouldn't waste money on a purchase now. You'll watch it once and be done with it. Put it on your rental list and wait for it to come in. This same director did Haywire and again it is very slow. Great concepts but need to be done better!
1,ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY REVIEW,"This is not a review of the Blu-Ray Contagion so much as it is a review of the Ultraviolet Digital Copy. Ultraviolet is HORRIBLE!- First and foremost, there is NO SUPPORT FOR iTUNES!!!- You have to create 2 separate accounts - one for Flixter and one for Ultraviolet and they don't talk to each other very well. The user-interface is completely NOT intuitive or easy to navigate.- Streaming is what they really want you to do with YOUR digital copy. This is an attempt to tell you HOW, WHEN and WHERE you can use YOUR digital media!- Streaming on iOS devices is horrible. I got nothing but crashes, hangs and horrible image quality.- DO NOT SUPPORT ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPIES! Give consumers a choice to either download digital copies to iTunes, Windows Media Player, or use the crappy UV/Flixster tandem of lameness!"
5,Outstanding!!,This movie does a very good job of showing how public health would respond during a real pandemic and does so in an entertaining way. And most importantly it emphasizes that everyone should WASH THEIR HANDS!!
4,Realistic depiction of worldwide biological infection,"Unlike many horror films, this dramatic depiction of a deadly virus on the move worldwide is very scary. If the stars weren't so recognizable you might think this is a well done documentary about how biological infection occurs. Let's hope the terrorists aren't paying attention. Steven Soderbergh manages to assemble a fine cast of actors in this globally interwoven story of the infected and those fighting against it. Several ""A"" list actors give up their glamorous status and even die. What is most interesting is that Soderbergh never loses focus on the identifying the cause of the disease and its location. We see panic in the streets as the preventative vaccine finally arrives. The doses are distributed based on a lottery system, but we see favoritism and criminalist activity prevail. It all seems a little too real."
2,Rather Boring,"It was rather boring and lack lustre.Matt Damon was detached from the movie and the situations at the start,It is slow paced and lacking in thrill.Utterly disappointed i chose to watch this on family movie night.It leaves one in suspense with most of the characters they pursued in the movie,it lacks proper development for characters such as the blogger,Why are they introduced to the movie ,is it only to prolong it,i think they would have been able to expand on his character.This are just some of the aspects i found lacking in the movie however my dissatisfaction should not deter other movie lovers from watching it.It just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Gonna get sick.....,"Just rented this but haven't watched it yet; in anticipation of the impact to the brain this is no doubt going to cause....why am I doing this? Well, the preview looked good. Good excuse, I guess. By coincidence, I have Terminator I in my computer; was going to re-view this for the 10000,00000.00 time but then saw this movie on Amazon Instant-got (cough, cough) hooked, I think! Anyway, will view this now but while holding my breath for a nightmare, daymare, whatever...Hope not! (Haven't had the flu since 2003, and would like to keep it that way)! Movie looks good so here I go......."
1,Terrible Acting,"This has to be one of the worst acted movies I've ever seen! Are you kidding me? Big names actors with an awful script! Terrible writing, bad acting, woeful music, trite plot, how did this ever pass the test audience? Even if this was a TV movie on a low budget I would rate this a burn for uselessness. It was like a bad joke! I felt that everyone was paid to not act!"
1,Not a good movie,"This movie was a huge let down, if it were not for the famous actors, this movie would not have been worth watching."
1,Talk About Being Sick,"The climax wasn't delivered. There was NO build up to a climatic moment. It was very slow paced & there was nothing that had us on the edge of our seats in anticipation of something big happening. From the previews we saw, it looked to be an ""edge of your seat"" type of movie, but when we watched it we couldn't wait to get out of our seats. We almost walked out, but we stayed hoping that something good would happen, but nothing ever did. If you want to watch a good movie about a viral break out then watch ""Outbreak"" or ""Resident Evil"". This movie had a lot of good actors that performed well, but the story was not captivating to us. What a waste of money spent to make this. Maybe the book is fantastic & captivating but the movie didn't show it."
1,"If you like stupid, this movie is for you","Nothing ever happens in this movie. Thousands of people are supposed to be sick, but NO ONE ever works, municipal services collapse- it's the end of the world! Hollywood always goes for the cheap shot: if a bunch of people experience life in the same way (in this movie they are sick unto death), then we all must be having the same experience. No matter that people outside of big cities would not have the same exposure to disease that people in LA have.And the ending about the source of the virus could hardly be any dumber. If it were even remotely true, the human race would never have gotten off the ground...Get the old Dustin Hoffman movie about ebola disease, Breakout. Much better movie. It even has some explosions! And Rene Russo."
3,"Same plot as ""Outbreak""","Same old plot as ""Outbreak"". Movie slow, and a waste of excellent actors. Thought ""Outbreak"" was better with Hoffman, Freeman, etc."
3,Lots of star power,I was hoping for great movie with all the actors in this. Very slow and not what I expected. What til it comes on cable
4,Contagion,"It is a very good movie, not only for the general audience but for students of epidemiology. Apart from been amusing is based upon solid scientific knowledge."
2,Something is wrong with this movie.,"This movie started out with a bang but towards the end, it looks like somebody decided to slap something quickly together so they can rush it out the door. The last 45 seconds of the movie is so far fetched I had to laugh out loud. It had a chance to be a great movie but the director blew it. So sad."
1,NOT A GOOD MOVIE,"This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The cast seemed to be well thought of, but the story line had no connections in it."
1,don't even rent it,runs like one of those made for TV disaster flicks - poor acting - poor story line. I can't believe Matt Damon would even let them put his name on it. If they would let me give it a zero - I would. SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY - DON'T DO IT
2,Boring,I thought after watching the previews it looked action packed. Unfortunately it was slow. Matt Damons acting was disappointing compared to The Bourne Identity which was great.
1,What a disappointment,"Stephen King's The Stand this ain't.I read the premise for this film, and saw that it had an all-star cast, incuding Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon. Had to be good, right?Wrong. I don't know how this film managed to be a cliched, boring drag when the subject matter is a 1918 Spanish-flu-like virus spreading around the world. But it seems to be lacking in anything stimulating or exciting. The characters were wooden and shallow, making it difficult to care about any of them.And the plot dragged on and on, showing scene after scene of people panicking. There was the usual conspiracy theories produced by a cliched internet blogger, the government of the United States was ineffectual and bumbling, and the government of other countries either didn't care or had no clue as to what they should do, so they did nothing.Avoid this turkey and if you want a thrilling virus movie, find Stephen King's The Stand, which is absolutely true to his book.Jeani Rector, EditorThe Horror Zine"
2,Contagion,"This movie streams in great on the roku. I really like ordering movies from amazon. The movie itself was kind of disappointing. Its OK, just thought it would have been a little better. Hope this helps."
2,Total meh.,Zero character development and zero suspense equals zero interest. Too many talented actors with too little to work with. Total meh.
2,Got HD version,"I wish I just got the regular version as it was less money,as I dont feel this movie was not worth $ 4.99.I really wanted to like this movie but found it boring.It did have some very interesting parts in it, but overall a disappointment.To bad, I usually love these kinds of movies."
1,UltraViolet Digital Copy SUCKS!,"UltraViolet Digital Copy is no good. You can't use it with iTunes, you have to download WB/ Flixster player as it will not play on anything else otherwise you have to stream it to watch. SUCKS! I no longer purchase anything with the UltraViolet Digital Copy."
3,Half a Good Movie,"I didn't really like any of the characters in this movie, but the story was interesting and well told. What would happen if an outbreak of what turns out to be some kind of bat-pig flu begins to destroy life on Earth? Because it's so realistic, it's easy for all the characters to run together. They're all SO CONCERNED about everything. Okay. Got it. Snore. The one interesting character was the doctor who decides to try the vaccine on herself. I would've liked this one better with zombies."
5,Good movie,"Had a little trouble getting the movie to load while I was on board an Alaska Air flight, lagged a lot. But finally got it going. Super clear picture."
3,Interesting,Good story line and the extra features are very educational. Slow at times and some of the characters are not believable and could have been left out. Overall a good movie when nothing else is on.
3,Virus taking control,"This movie is meditation on what would happen to the world if there was a global threat about the virus. We live in a global world where people travel around the world within days. What happens when a globe throtter catches a disease of unknown origin, with no known cure that spreads on contact? How such desease affects nations, health care oganizations, politics and economy? What impact on population can news organizations and governments have?This film is peppered with big name actors."
3,Good movie.,Good thriller. Interesting. Jennifer Ehle steals the movie. She is great as a doctor.Good thriller. Interesting. Jennifer Ehle steals the movie. She is great as a doctor.Good thriller. Interesting. Jennifer Ehle steals the movie. She is great as a doctor.
4,Excellent disease procedural,"An excellent disease procedural with fine performances from an outstanding cast. There's a distance to it, though. I never really felt any of these people or shared what they experienced. The cinematography is often dark and flat with faces hidden in shadow (almost looking like a digitally projected movie, though I decidedly saw it on film) which contributes to distancing the audience from the characters and their respective plights. Perhaps the DVD/Blu-Ray may improve on this."
5,Saw in theatres,"I saw this when it was in theatres.It has a huge cast, but the different story lines tie together well. The reaction of different global agencies and governments seemed realistic. But, I left wanting to shower and wear gloves for the rest of my life.I thought it was great."
2,Too bad that there is no vacine to protect your from this film!,What a slow paced boring boring movie. It was like watching grass die from lack of water. i thought the idea had merrit to realistically portray a pandemic. But the director also forgot to entertain.
2,boring,"I found this movie to be on the boring side. The trailer makes the film look a lot better then it really is IMO. I was really hoping to enjoy it. Def. save your money, rent before you decide to buy."
2,Somewhat boring,"This movie seemed as exciting as a zombie movie without the zombies, as if all the parts that would've given it impact were left out. This is not a film for those who like films with a touch violence and/or gore. I came away feeling as if I'd watched the Disney version of a horror movie. On the other hand if you've somehow missed all the media hype about H1N1 this film might be novel enough."
2,And the point of this movie was???,"Most movies have plots, character development, action sequences that drive the audience from place to place, but not Contagion. No this was just a look at what might happen in the event of a viral pandemic. So what? Do I need to know which hardware stores to rob in the event that everyone, but me, is sick? Government conspiracies involving none other than Big Pharma, a blogger's greed...you get it all, but a real story. How movies like this get produced is beyond me. So I'll ask again, what was the point of this movie?"
1,UtraViolet digital copy a rip-off,"Movie is OK, but I buy Blu-rays labeled ""digital copy"" so I can import to my ITunes library and sync to my IPAD and other IOS standalone devices to watch when traveling.Ultraviolet does not work with ITunes - it is simply a streaming service - so unless you are connected via wi-fi or 3G - when you want to watch the movie - you are out of luck.I sent an email to Ultraviolet asking for the ITUNES authorization code (they do exist - go to the Apple Blog related to Ultraviolet) and received the following response:""UltraViolet works on iPhones and iPads and many more devices (Android phones/tablets, Windows PCs, Macs, etc.), but currently, the iTunes library does not support the listing of UltraViolet content.""THIS IS NOT TRUE ""DIGITAL COPY"" - IT IS DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING."
1,Sorry I Bought This Movie,"I was Really looking forward to watching this. I was Really disappointed - It was slow, never built up to a climax, it was, actually, quite boring."
3,BOTHERSOME,"Obviously the cast of actors were great. I like seeing them in their artistic nature, But the quality of the movie was not so good, I didn't like the camera they used. The lighting was a problem. But I was involved. It bothered me that people were dying and before that had seizures. It was okay. Just a blur now."
1,UltraViolet BLU-RAY review,"This is a review of the disc itself, not the movie. If you buy the 2disc version and are looking to take the movie with you, then the ultraviolet digital copy blu-ray is NOT the way to go. With ultraviolet you cannot download the movie onto your device. You have to stream the movie. Therefore, if you would normally watch your digital copies on a portable device during a roadtrip or on a flight - you won't be able to do this with the ultraviolet digital copy unless you have continuous internet connection with a strong signal. Also, the ultraviolet digital copies do not play on itunes; they only play via flixster, so if you're an apple person this may not be best for you. Personally, I plan on purchasing the 1 disc version, because I refuse to pay for something that doesn't satisfy my needs."
1,Avoid this like the plague,This movie is your typical end of the world scenario. It is very depressing to watch but not because it is scary but because it is slow and uneventful. Th eside plots are very weak. Gwyneth has a very short role that is summarized at the end of the movie. Its one of those films that you can not wait for the end and when it comes you want your money back. Save your money!
1,Will not play on SONY BDP-S550,"The player stated I need to update the firmware to play it so I did. Update successful.Restart and placed in disk, got the same message - checked update again, and it stated update was already done.Any one else with this problem? The disc will not play."
1,"Kind of good in the beginning, then gross!","Okay, so patient zero gets the disease from a chef's nasty handshake from handling a pig who had been contaminated by a bat, blah blah blah. Anyway, this movie caught my interest within the first 15 minutes but then I lost interest when I saw that this wasnt going to get any better than people dying over and over by the same disease. While it had a great opening, the rest of the movie dragged on."
2,Don't waste your money,"This movie was so boring it put me to sleep. When I go to see a contastraphy movie I expect panic, there was a thin amount of panic once in a while, but for the most part it was all scientific with citizen's waiting it out at home. There were a few good parts where the young woman inoculated herself, and then went out of her way to infect herself, the prom dance, and the kidnapping. I am pretty sure that what I viewed about the politics within the world's governments and the health departments was right on target. But when I go to see a movie, or in this case rent one, I want to be removed from normalcy, and moved into fantasy for that short while, this did not fulfill that need. It left me wanting more."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Sad acting, lack of an original plot, totally predictable, etc....Good actors at their worst. Directing was lame. What a waste of what appears to have been a good budget."
2,Achoo!,"Realistically, if this film didn't have so many big name stars would anyone have bothered watching it based on the premise alone?I hate to say it, but summing it up, this movie left me cold. I was not even a little impressed. Yes, it was well intentioned, but on a whole, it barely rose above a public service announcement: cover your mouth when you cough and use a lot of hand sanitizer. That, and don't mix your bats with your pigs. Like who does!?I also found the pacing dead slow until, inexplicably (under time constraints?), there was a rush to wrap everything up. Well, not everything, there were a few glaring loose ends that I also found annoying. Why bother mentioning something if you're not going to follow through with it? In addition, the flashback coda was a bit pretentious and not a little insulting; got the point, no need to hit us over the head with a sledgehammer.So glad I didn't buy it."
2,Not contagious,"Jude Law's profiteering web journalist was actually a pretty clever plot device. Beyond that, Contagion is as crammed with the cliches as one would expect from a disaster movie. The acting is strong, but the predictability was just too much for me."
4,"Grim, Depressing Realism, But Good",This movie explores the possibilities and dangers of living in a society where worldwide transportation is readily available as a means of spreading disease. The assumptions are all plausible and move with a rather frightening logic to their devastating conclusions.While this movie moves along quickly and definitely holds ones attention it is also depressingly feasible and demonstrates how vulnerable our society is to the spread of a serious disease and how thin the veneer of civilization that protects it from chaos really is.The movie is rated PG-13 but the subject matter is serious enough that I would take care as to which members of the family saw it; it has some very disturbing scenes showing patients as the disease advances.
2,Very Grime. Depressing.,"The basic plot is about a contagion that quickly spreads and kills, while the medical community races to stop it and create a vaccine. Unlike in the movie Outbreak, Contagion has no needed moments of comic relief. No smiles. No bits of humor. It is grim and depressing throughout. Though that's how things would be in real life should a pandemic breakout out, it provides agonizing entertainment. Despite the many stars, including an appearance by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, I didn't care about any of the characters.Though I'm glad I only rented this DVD, I feel that I wasted my money anyway."
4,So good-watched it twice!!,"Not only was it a good movie that kept me interested! Love all the tidbits of ""inside"" info & the politics of how things work- example being - when did we run out of body bags?-lookin into gettin some from Canada...BUT..they figured they'd WAIT!!!!! & see!!!!! Did Mr Creever take Forsythia-he gave wife a dose & small child, but U dont see him taking any... Did Forsythia work??? I think it did-the blogger was sick & looked it-but he was better then...Informative,more real scenario of how it would be. Not one of them movies that centers on one family & everything always works out so easily for them & stuff falls in their laps almost like magic...& they live happily ever after..NOPE...this is more like the real deal!! will watch again & again.."
3,drags on and on,This is an okay movie. My only problem is how it just kept dragging on and on. I bought it at a good price and figured since Lawrence Fishburne was in it that it would be great. Well I was wrong.
1,Lasted 10 hours,I am so glad I did not see this boring movie in the theater. It took me two days to get through it on video. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.
1,Did not rec'd both movies,I only rec'd 1 DVD I never rec'd the UltraViolet Digtal Copy of this movie. I was not pleased at all with this pleased whit this at all this purchased at all
2,Not that enthralling at all,"So I was eagerly awaiting this movie as i remembered seeing the trailer in the theatre.. After watching the film, unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype. So here are the pro's and con'sPro'sAll star cast!!Some suspense at timeskept me thinkingCon'sWeak actingIt was of the movie was developed on a shoestring budgetCheezy musicJust did not keep me on the edge of my seatWould I recommend someone renting this movie? If you have some time and don't mind spending several bucks sure.. But be warned you will be watching a B movie with A actors...."
1,horrible,what a terrible movie. slow and zero plot. don't wait for an ending. there is none. did i say it was a disappointment!
1,Propaganda from Big Pharma,"Contagion is another particularly disgusting example of Hollywood and Pharma pandering in public fear to sell tickets and inoculations, respectively."
2,Snoozefest,"Coma inducing. Slow. Slower...blah blah blah... Good thing they hired all those big name actors and actresses or I would feel ripped off. Oh well I guess I still feel ripped off even with the dollar rental price. Is my review stupid and boring? Well,so was this turd of a movie."
3,Interesting....kinda slow moving,"Interesting story, but the way it was told and the way the movie is presented couldhave been better. Good movies keeps me awake...i fell asleep on this one. Was itthe music, the acting..the pace.... Ill give it another shot in the near futureand edit this review."
2,ugh,"Great actors, but the plot really ruined it for me. I wanted more. The whole movie was based on the ""karma"" concept. You have to believe in karma to like this one."
4,not a bad movie...not great but good,"I recall ""Outbreak"" from a few years ago. Similar plot. New virus threatens to kill mankind. This movie was pretty good and had a good cast. I do prefer ""Outbreak"" which was very similar and starred Dustin Hoffman/Rene Russo/Morgan Freeman. Still for $5 it provided good entertainment on a Saturday night and ordering through Amazon on my Roku couldn't be easier."
3,Nothing really special here,"It was a ok watch at best, nothing really special. Had periods where it sort of...dragged...for lack of a better word and the ending seemed to be liked rushed...like the time limit of the movie was up or something? So, its just ok...not one of the better ones."
3,Small Eye Holes,"It's a decent mask, it's been months since my husband wore it to my daughters Star Wars party and it's still intact. Biggest issue was that the eye holes are hella small and hard to see through clearly for an adult. Probably could have been fixed by cutting the holes a little bigger, but we didn't notice till right before the party. No big. If it came down to it, I would still buy this mask."
1,Darth Maul Mask,"This mask was ordered with expidited shipping(1-2 days) which I paid extra for and the product did not come for 5 days. When the masked arrived it was old, and discolored. It had a large slit up the back beyond the original opening. Basically the mask was in awful shape. I made every attempt to have it exchanged or returned but was not able( to this date ) to have that done. Very disappointed, my Halloween part was ruined!!"
3,good addition,"good addition to other strength tapes in your posession. Slow, deliberate moves are quite taxing."
3,one song is good,I heard a song from this CD on Pandora and loved it so bought the CD. I figured I would love the rest of the songs. That was not the case. I really only like the one song I bought it for.
2,Anyone for a quick airport book?,"Let me start and say this is the only Silva book I've read. I've been seeing Silva put out a Gabriel Allon book every year or so and decided that if the character has warranted so many books, it must be worth something. How wrong was I!Let me start with the good. The book has a good flow and pace and is, in general, a quick fun read (hence an airport book). The Holocaust research is also interesting and well adapted into the story. Unfortunately, my praise ends about there. The plot is simplistic (zero twists), the characters are very shallow (one was involved in kidnapping Eichmann and the other in hunting the '72 Olympics murderers - WOW!!!) and underdeveloped and the story leaves much to be desired.I said this was my first Silva book and I must say (unless I'm at the airport again) it will probably be my last. Whoever in the Chicago Sun-Times rated Silva as the new John Le Carre, should reread any Le Carre."
5,A Death in Venice,Gabriel Allon iiiii iiiiiiii oooooo aaaaaaa lllll ooooo nnnnnnn tttttt yyyyyy rrrr pppppppppp ddddd wwwwwooo ooodddd eeeee rrrr ttttttt ggggggg
3,Beautiful Vienna,"My First Silva novel and I guess I expected more. I guess I was looking more of the writing and plot style of Grisham or Clancy. But all in all, I enjoyed the read and will read his other works.If you're looking for a different and exciting novel, read LUST OF THE FLESH by Beverly Rolyat. A story about district attorney, Nick Allapapalaus, who finds himself caught up in a web of lust, deceit, mystery, suspense, betrayal, murder and sex galore. Is he really the biological father of his ex-wife's promiscuous teenage daughter's infant son? Or has he been set up? A compelling, riveting, engaging, pageturning novel. Enjoy!"
3,The Lakeview,"This was a well written mystery/thriller with a European setting for the primary action. It was a good yarn with lots of twists and turns and Silva does a good job building the characters. However, much of the book was framed in Jewish customs including Jewish holidays, events, etc. Not being Jewish, I was unfamiliar with any of these references to Judaism so I found it confusing. In fact, I had to skip over these references and it made following the plotline quite awkward. I understand that Silva is Jewish, but he uses these references to he detriment of non-jewish readers and spoils an otherwise good story."
5,My First Silva novel,"I have always been a fan of espionage novels, and this one really had me from the get-go. I will be reading more of his novels."
4,Another great book by Mr. Silva!,"I have just started reading Daniel Silva's novels and found his storyline to be very strong and believable. At the beginning of the book I had to go back and pick up on some of the characters as they all seem to be introduced at the same time. That is my only minor complaint of the book. Usually authors will introduce characters in a well timed sequence but not in this book.Once a found out who was who, it was great reading! Plenty of action, suspense and thrills to keep you reading well in to the night."
2,Wait for the Movie!,"Not great literature, and not a page turner either, it is an OK read. The Austrians are efficient, protective, and resemble the authoritarian picture of them from World War II. The Swiss character is a banker. The Americans are pragmatic, looking at a greater world view. The main woman in the story (who has a small part to play) is beautiful, cunning, and as effective as any assassin. And the Israelis are efficient, determined, intelligent, and get their man. Obviously, lots of stereotypes.It would probably make a better movie than a book."
5,Excellent and intelligent novel,"I truly enjoy novels that are more than just good writing, though Silva's work clearly meets this standard. This book is intelligent, thoughtful and well researched. Silva calls upon historical references to WW2 and the holocaust, making the novel both an excellent read and emotionally charged.Beyond these points, Silva's writes a darn good spy/assassin/intrigue novel."
4,Another winner from Daniel Silva,"Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon character finally comes to grips with his mother's tortured past. Really well done, just not quiteaas good as the other two Vienna series novels."
2,Not as good as his others,Daniel Silva disappoints in this fairly formulaic story. Characters are subordinated to another fairly standard recap of the Nazi era. Not his best work.
3,Not one of my favorites,"This is the first time that I have read this author, and I think that it will be the last...this book for the most part was very boring and I could not wait to finish the thing..most of the words that he uses in this book are very hard to pronounce, and he does not give a lot of feedback to his characters, this is something that would be very helpful to someone, such as myself that has never read his books. I did not feel compelled to care about these characters in this book in the least....some action, but very little....I do not care to read another of this authors books.....if you must read, I suggest you look for earlier works, so that you are not left out in the cold as to who these ppl are in the book!!!!"
5,Hilarious and True...,"I've been following Lauren Grodstein's work closely since she appeared in the ""Virgin Fiction 2"" collection (an anthology of short stories by young talented unpublished writers) and I think she is one of the most interesting and funny new voices out there. I recommend this book highly -- I've already given it as a gift to six people, all of whom loved it!"
1,a definite disappointment,"Having read this book, and things Ms. Foxe has said in other books, it's easy to see that she is bitter about not getting more money out of Steven Tyler. She manages to gloss-over the fact that she dumped her first husband, David Johansen, for the wealthy Tyler. All in all, her ranting makes for an annoying, uninformative read."
1,A bitter memoir that tells nothing about Steven Tyler,I was severely disappointed with Cyrinda's autobiography. I expected more inside stuff on Steven Tyler and Aerosmith during one of the most troubling times of the band's existence.
3,Dream On. Living On The Edge With Steven Tyler.,"This type of honesty,in a book, makes one realize that no matter how RICH/FAMOUS/TALENTED/KNOWN,that someone is,that they still OWN ISSUES, maybe more,then the ones who adulate them. They are FLESH&BLOOD, and they make plenty of POOR JUDGEMENTS/HURT THEIR LOVED ONES/CHEAT/LIE, that us FANS hardly know about, because they are""mollycoddled"", and attempts are made to always TRY to make them appear on the GOOD side."
2,You have GOT to be kidding!,"Im going to make this short & sweet. I found 99% of this book totally unbelievable. I mean, geeze, give Tyler a break, there is no way he could have been that messed up and still front the best rock band in the world. And that stuff about Tyler and Perry, I just dont buy it, nope."
2,Cyrinda is a little full of herself,"I know Steven Tyler should have done more for his daughter with Foxe and she is bitter about that, but he is her father and she should let it go. I guess she needed the money so decided to dish the dirt and try to make herself look good. It had its ok parts but most of the book was just Cyrinda whining."
2,Should not of been made to look as if its all about Steven,"I thought Cyrinda's Bitterness showed thru in many aspects of this book!It should of been named ""I want to talk about Myself But Let me put Stevens pic on the cover""considering Both her & Steven were admitted heavy drug abusersduring the time they were married How factual can either of them be?"
5,GREAT ART - AMAZING PRICE!,"I already owned a poster print of Dali's ""Geopoliticus Child...."" that I framed in a nice heavy poster frame from Michael's, so I was stoked to find this print that was printed in the same ""collection"" (both have the same white trim with his signature at bottom). They will look great hung one above the other! But the best thing was the PRICE! It was under 50 cents (!!) & shipping was low too. The whole thing cost me about $3 with shipping. Really awesome! You don't have to be rich to enjoy good art.... poster prints are great when framed nicely."
2,(Post)Moderns Respond to the Ancestors,"This disc consists of three short films in which living filmmakers try to respond to or recreate films of the Silent Era. ""Queer"" in the title means ""non-normative,"" as not every one of the shorts has homoerotic content. Because there are so many subtitles here, one can't watch this as passively as one would with a ""talkie."" In fact, you can't blink because you'll miss something. This work is meant to give a forum to young filmmakers. Its intended audience is hardcore fans of independent film. The last of the three works is the most touching, but also the most predictable and facile. I am not sure who worships the Silent Era in this day and age, but the disc is for that small group."
5,Great Book,I loved this book. I was a great book about rediscovering something from long ago. I thought that it was great and I can't wait to read Picture Perfect and Just Visiting. I have yet to read Save the Date too. I can hardly wait for them to come out. I think all of the Madison books are great.
4,T_a_Y_l_o_R D_ o_O_l_e_y_ F_A_N,"I am a great lover of these books, they are fun 2 read when u have time 2 read... you should read them because they are about a girl who has a pet doggie and a crush and a cool laptop she writes on.. Great book!*To read more of my reviews look for the title on the reviews:T_a_Y_l_o_R D_ o_O_l_e_y_ F_A_Nenjoy reading!"
4,Super Cute,This product is very cute and I would definitely recommend it! It came as promised and appears to be made very well. It is the perfect keepsake.
1,Don't buy if you want real ninja fighting techniques,"First off this is a terrible book if you want to learn real ninjutsu. I personally own this book and a few other titles by Ashida Kim aka Radford W. Davis. I exchanged personal emails with Mr. Davis and he hates amazon. He also claims to be trained in the Koga ninja arts, which died out. If you don't believe me check out wikipedia and type in ""Ashida Kim"" or ""Koga ninja"" That being said, the fighting in this book demonstrate: Karate/Kung Fu/Gung Fu techniques not authentic ninjutsu. The weapons skills are basic and anyone wiht that kind of weapon in their hand could probably figure out.You want to possess real ninja fighting skills join the Bujinkan or the Genbukan. Picking up a book with not endow you with the awesome fighting ability. Enroll in at a dojo, practice, get instruction a real Sensei, and train. Please don't waste you money."
1,This guy is fake,"Ok, I will get straight to the point and say that you should NOT buy this book. Ashida Kim is not Asian, and his name comes from 2 different countires (Ashida=Japan, Kim=Korea). Now, Stephan Hayes is also not Asian, but has practiced NinjUtsu. Ashida Kim does not even say in his books how he got to be a ninja. He writes this farfetched stories that couldn't even get published in a fictional book.Save your money. You want NinjUtsu, not NinjItsu, go to Hatsumi or Hayes. Not Kim."
1,Very Poor Audio Quality,"First note, because I hate not knowing: this is a mix CD. None of the songs go full length, they're all mixed in and out of. Even the first song has beats from another song (one that comes later in the disc mysteriously) laying over the intro!!!!The song selection is great, which is what drew me to this item. Like others have noted for other CD's in the series, the audio is sub-standard. I didn't see the reviews of the other entries in the series until after I had ordered this. I'm fairly sure this was mastered from vinyl because there seem to be a lot of pops and hiss. If you're just looking for something to rip to your mp3 player, this might be OK. The mixes aren't world class but not bad and the song selection is good. IF you need something to play in a club or through a powerful car or home system, this is not the disc for you."
1,straight up dissappointed,i for one enjoyed pretty much all the music in this cd but what i hate that all of these songs were cut down to size they weren't the full versions i was expecting them to be if i would have know about this i wouldn't have purchase any of these cd they should have been a 2 disc box set but it wasn't know i have to find the full version of these songs . (Work It Out Vol. 6DISCO BOX VOLUME 6 WORK IT OUT)
2,"Beautiful prose, no plot","Make no mistake about it: this book has beautifully lyrical prose. The writing is quite enchanting. But simply put, there is no plot. Nothing happens. The book's foundation is essentially on the relationship between a mother and her daughter. The daughter is a health worker living in Niger, West Africa, where she'd spent some of her childhood. The narrative alternates between the present and the mother's reminiscence of her daughter's and husband's years in Niger and Nigeria. Despite the heavy interior monologue, I never felt I had much insight into any of the character's psyches. I like character driven novels, but I didn't feel Ms. Hill's characterization was particular strong. Having lived in West Africa, I did appreciate some of the description; it was very heavily sensory, but you can't make a whole novel out of that. All in all, I was impressed by the prose, but the story was not very compelling. It was a struggle to finish."
2,"Rambling, re-hashed and NOT scary!","More historical than anything. One problem is that majority of these stories have been re-hashed in many other books, and many accounts just ramble on and on and are boring and not interesting. Author does NOT know how to grab your attention! Not worth over $1."
5,amazing,"thandiswa has an amazing voice, she has really proven her talent in this album. i'm totally loving it!!"
5,A fascinating tour of American thrift and ingenuity,"Written by an expert curator of the Patents Information Service of The British Library, American Inventions: A History Of Curious, Extraordinary, & Just Plain Useful Patents is an amazing showcase featuring dozens of original patent drawings from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, revealing unique and unforgettable American inventions from the Frisbee to bobby pins and in-line skates. An extremely well-researched and fascinating tour of American thrift and ingenuity throughout the twentieth century."
3,A bit too pompous for my taste,"The voices are great and the organ impressive, but these are simple hymns that wither a bit under the grand, sweeping treatment they receive from the performers. The tempo is drearily slow, even in the sprightlier hymns like ""Be Thou My Vision"" and ""Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken.""Perhaps the sonorous setting where this recording made precludes a faster pace, but just a little more joy and and less weighty pomposity would have improved these beloved hymns 200%."
3,kings college choir,cant be bothered searchng for the cd i boughtit was ok just anoying i only wanted 1 song had to pay $30 to get it
2,Disappointing,"Having been a church organist for 40 years, I was excited to receive this CD ""Best-Loved Hymns."" However, I was disappointed in that only 7 of the 18 selections were melodies that I expected to hear. The choir performances and quality of the productions were excellent, however, there were several songs that were completely new to me and some familiar titles were not the melodies we sing at church. Ones that would be familiar to most American church-goers are: Be Thou My Vision, A Mighty Fortress, Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence, Praise to the Lord the Almighty, The Lord's My Shepherd, Thine Is the Glory, and the Doxology. I should have researched the melodies more carefully before purchasing."
1,Warning! You'll Be Sorry,"I would love to give this 5 stars because I love all these songs, However it plays like a worn out tape that was made in the 70's. Each song about 2 minutes long. Sound is the worst i've ever heard."
5,Worth it,"If you bought the Canon HV10 like I did, you'll soon find that the 15 minute BP-310 battery it came with just isn't going to cut it. Oh the other hand, I've gotten almost 2 hours from the Lenmar BP-315. It's approximately twice as thick as the BP-310, but not a problem when installed on the camera. I bought two BP-315 batteries along with the Canon CG-300 charger which I also recommend."
1,It didn't last!,About a third of the price of a Canon but lasted less than a year. Supposed 3 year warranty. Probably will avoid the aftermarket battery packs for the HV10.
1,One use battery,"Bought the battery, charged the battery, used the battery and the battery never worked again. I used it once and was never able to recharge it. I've put it through 2 different battery chargers and am 100% positive that I'm using it correctly. Hopefully the 3 year warranty doesn't have strings attached."
3,Bootleggers and their Era,"This book is all right, but no more than that. As an outsider, Allsop fails to put the bootleg violence into any context, and he follows the line of previous books without questioning their purported information. So he has Capone beating the Cicero mayor without any corroboration other than it appeared somewhere else. The bibliography shows that Allsop's research is only skin deep."
5,excellent book on flower gardening,"I highly recommend this book , if you are an inexperienced, or even experienced gardener. This book is full of helpful tips and detailed instructions on everything from location to disease and insect advice for flowers."
3,could have been better....,"it would have been alot better if it had a picture for each flower that they had listed i would say this book is ""ok"" seems kinda outdated also."
1,This is a lousy bag,"You must have a seat that fits the dimensions of this bag's metal plates that actually attach to the seat bottom.If you don't, and I don't, this bag's quick release will only be partially engaged. The next thing you know, the bag is riding on top of the tire."
2,Doesn't fit all saddles,"Not a terrible design, but doesn't fit all. Some of the narrow and flat saddles, such as a Selle Italia doesn't work."
1,Poor Quality and Design,I have broken two of these and will not be ordering any more Topeak products. I contacted Topeak and was told just call to order replacement parts. The sliding mecanism that secrures the bag breaks. It is very cheap plastic. Maybe this would be ok just for road use but not on a mountain bike.
3,A little pricey,"I bought this bag for a Toronto to Montreal charity bike ride. I do like the quick release feature and the straps to hold a mini pump. Wish it was bigger (will only hold a patch kit and spare inner tube and maybe a bike tool, that is it) and seems expensive compared to Mountain Coop bags. It does appear to be well built and I will hopefully get my money's worth.3 stars because of size and price."
2,"Great Bag, But...","Just got this item on Friday.Install was easy. the wedge pack look great.try to get the pack out by pressing the plastic quick release tap.must be my bad luck. the plastic quick release tap break right when i press it. O well, back to Amazon it goes."
3,"good bag, but be careful!!!","I agree with other reviewers that it is a very good bag. I have the large version and it seems I can always stuff more and more into it. But...as other reviewers have said, the plastic is cheap and it broke several days after I started using it (the plastic connector attached to the bag on top). I wasn't upset when it broke because it was so cheap compared to other bags, and I bought a new plastic piece for about $3. BUT...when it broke, I was just coming out of a tunnel and it landed on my back wheel. It felt like someone put the brakes on hard, and if I had been in the tunnel at the time it could have resulted in a bad accident. Luckily I didn't fall. So that worries me...beware with this bag!! I have since sewed on velcro fasteners as double protection (to wrap around the metal bars on the saddle) so that if the plastic breaks again, the bag will not fall onto my back wheel."
3,"Nice quality, bigger than expected","As with other Topeak equipment I have, the bag is of great quality. But I was suprised at how large it was. I returned it for the small version and that can still fit a spare innertube, mini toolkit, wallet, keys and phone easily."
3,Great But Strap Chafes,"The compartment is very roomy and can hold tubes, levers, CO2 tanks, etc. However, the velcro strap around the seatpost has caused me some problems.I ride on a Specialize Toupe saddle, which is very narrow and has minimal padding. This allows my thigh to run inward toward the seatpost a little more than a more generous saddle would. There has been a tremendous amount of rubbing on the velcro strap. Because the strap has relatively sharp edges, it actually caused a hole in my very expensive Descente shorts on a recent century ride.If you ride a padded, wider saddle, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you ride a narrow, thin saddle, you might want to look elsewhere for your saddle bag. Most likely you'll need something with a strap that attaches closer to the underside of the saddle or without a strap at all."
5,Perfect bag!,These Aero bags are the perfect bag for mountain or road biking. I do recommend the small for road and the medium for mountain if all you care about is carrying along emergency and maintenance supplies. The medium on the road bike looked to big. Also the velcro mount may be better for certain mountain bike saddles with suspension seat posts or if you ride with your saddle far forward.
2,Cheap plastic,"I have owned this bag for four months. Very pleased at first with storage size and ease of installment. After 3 months of riding (xc and back roads 50+ miles a week)the cheap plastic, that connects to the seat, broke. If you do any riding over bumps, curbs, gravel or trails beware, next thing you know you will have your bag flapping on your rear tire. I had to jimmy rig the bag through the reflector strap to the rear of my seat with a nylon cord. They should have put either metal or another velcro strap at the top."
4,Good but overpriced.,"I Like the necklace- not the quality/craftmanship I expected for 17 dollars. It's hollow w/ no back, and the heart's somewhat off-center. Still, it's pretty, & basically sturdy/heavy, as is the chain, and arrived in decent time. If the price were lower I'd feel better about it though, (since I paid 5 dollars s/h for it to arrive in a small bubble sleeve..) In the end it's the best winged heart design I have found thus far so if someone else is considering it and isn't as much a perfectionist as I am, you'll probably be pleased."
5,Easy to install and reliable. Can't go wrong,A 9006 bulb with a nice blue tint to it. I would say it is hard to find a good bulb that you wont have to change every two months. This is your answer.
3,Rebel Yell,"Great T shirt, great colours but the print of the flag is a bit thick & rough. But it still looks great and wears well.Cheers Mick (HEANEY)"
1,Dawn Brown,"I ordered this product for delivery NLT 2 Dec 06 and still have not received it from Amazon. They score a BIG FAT ""F"". I have complained and they continue to extend the delivery date. Amazon is a zero.........!!"
2,"Cute, but not for kids with loose teeth","I found this at a book sale and thought it might be helpful when my granddaughter starts losing her teeth in the next year or so. Wrong. This book while humorous and cute, certainly will ratchet up the fear level in a small child who fears pain or has had a bad experience with a dentist or a tooth."
1,THE WORST CHILDREN'S BOOK,"I bought this book for my 5 year old granddaughter who has her first loose tooth. I was shocked by the expressions of pain, the scary pictures, and the complete nonsense. I would return it, but I'd rather throw it away so some other child doesn't get this book. Having a first loose tooth should be a bit of a pleasnt event. Not, a worry about ""tying the huge rope to his tooth and then to his car to speed away as fast as he could.""Garbage!!"
4,Great price for what you get,"Nice set of golf balls, divot tool and ball marker. Can't complain. Used this as a gift and the value was definitely there. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
5,works,"works great as it should ,drill hole install and you can drain pan without mess , just no fun to install first time factory should have put one there"
2,Not worth it,The ball came in plenty of time. There were no instructions included on how to inflate the ball. I had to contact the company to get the instructions. The foot pump is terrible. It whines like a dying animal and is impossible to inflate it to its proper size. I am getting a different ball soon.
2,Worked Good Until It Burst - Will Try to Get Another,"This ball had been used for maybe two weeks by my wife. Was a present to her, so now I feel bad I even got it as she feels like she broke it cause of her weight!! (weighs a mere 140lbs) It worked beautifully for that period, I do want to contact the company and see if they send a replacement out. If so, I will change the review.It inflated easily and didn't deflate. Seems like everyone else enjoys it so I probably just got a bad one, but my wife did not abuse it, only used in the living room so I hope they back up their product."
2,There is a new better Cubs music CD,"I bought this one a few years ago. This Cubs music CD is okay, with some songs about the Cubs, but mainly compilations of game highlights from Sosa, Grace and others. It also has Harry Caray singing. But not enough Cubs songs for my taste.If you want a new CD full of songs about the Chicago Cubs, including ""GO CUBS GO,"" and Harry Caray, I prefer ""Take Me Out To A Cubs Game""-which has a website with the same name. The CD also features a cool new song about Fukudome. Amazon should sell this CD. Cubs fans will love it!"
1,Save your money,Within one month belt clasp spring lost tension and had to buy a new one. Within three months nib on back of sheath broke off. No fixing that.
1,I can't get behind this product.,"Short and sweet....I loved this item. However, the tab on the back broke off twice turning the holder into a useless paperweight. I am now using a $2.99 plastic version from China."
2,Good to the Last Drop,"I'll be the first to tell you, I'm hard on phone cases. I have had a Treo 600 since they first came out, and when I upgraded recently to the Treo 650, this case was included. I've tried at least seven different cases, and have worn them all out (except for one).Like other reviewers, I really liked this case. It allows great access to all the features (screen, keys, camera, connections, etc.). Easy to put on and pull off the phone, held the phone tightly, easy to fasten and unfasten from the belt-clip for easy, instant access.All was fine, until I bumped it somehow, and the phone fell out. Then the phone hooked onto my seatbelt and fell out again. But after only three weeks, the phone made its final drop when it fell out onto the Sam's club floor for no apparent reason - until I noticed that the case was broken.When it comes to cases, durability is the number one issue with me, and unfortunately, an otherwise great design couldn't take the heat."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I enjoyed this holster for about 6 months before one of the side wings broke off rendering it useless. Overall it has a simple, sleek design, that allowed full access to all the functions of the phone while still in the holster, and the exterior leather gives it a nice feel. But the design has a major flaw in that the encased structure is made of stiff, brittle plactic that eventually failed. If the manufacturers had used metal instead of plastic they would have had a winner. But unfortunately they went the cheap route and I paid the price ($30). I give them 2 stars for a structurally inadequate design."
3,"Great book, poor condition : (","I've been looking for this book, so was excited to find it for a reasonable price.When I read about it's used condition, it seemed fine. I bought used beforefrom Amazon w/o a problem. Trouble is, when i recieved it, the pages werefalling out. So it's not likely to last long in the classroom.We'll see though...."
3,Sophie and WHO?,"This book is about Sophie. Sophie is a mouse (we can tell from the pictures, but not from the text) and she's very introverted. She's even too scared to talk to the freaking librarian. Gosh. She sits around her house and cleans a lot, watching the sun go up and down. Probably doesn't even have a TV.One day, a dance school opens across the street. Sophie doesn't bother to shell out money for lessons and just learns how to dance by eavesdropping. I know she's too shy to actually go to the school and all, but is she allowed to listen without paying? I guess so.By the time we're down to our last three pages of the book Sophie has mastered several dances on her own. But where the heck is Lou? I have no idea.Then some stranger randomly comes up to her door asking to dance. How often does that happen? She dances with the stranger and finds out he's the Lou guy from the story's title and the book suddenly ends.I would just call this book ""Sophie."""
3,Serves its purpose,"There are times when you need to get an air gun and air hose in a very tight place. This little dohickey allows you to manipulate your air hose where it otherwise would kink.However, you can find nearly the same product at Harbor Freight for $5."
5,Resisting temptations,"This is a must read for anyone who seriously wants to led a better life. The humor makes this a page turner, but the message makes this a book worth reading repeatedly. I often think about the ""all I want is..."" when I catch myself complaining about something going wrong.This is a great gift for believers or non-believers. This and another book of his ""The Great Divorce"" are the two books that I read the most often."
5,Read the Screwtape Letters again and again,"I was introduced to the Screwtape Letters when I was a child. I always liked reading C. S. Lewis books. I devoured the Chronicles of Narnia in less than a month. After that I started looking for any books I could find by Lewis. That's how I found the Screwtape Letters.This book contains what are supposed to be ""demonic communications."" A series of letters written by a greater demon, Screwtape, to his underling, Wormwood. Lewis doesn't tell us how he came into possession of these letters.Apparently, Wormwood is assigned to torment a human; which they call a ""patient."" Screwtape gives him pointers on how to turn this human away from the cause of Christ. It's a very weighty book for a ten-year-old to read, but I have come back to the book again as an adult.The screwtape letters is a good read, I am enjoying reading it a second time. It reminds us that there really are fallen angels out there who don't want us to work for the cause of Christ."
5,Timeless Wisdom,"C.S. Lewis seems to transcend time with his vivid depiction of the ageless battle between Satan and God for the souls of men. Although the account is fictional, its message could never be more relevant."
4,Temptors,"The Screwtape Letters are a unique perspective on Christianity in that the faith is seen through the eyes of those who have given their soul to Satan. It is interesting to think of the faith from the perspective of those trying to undermind it.Uncle Screwtape mentors Wormword, through a series of letters, in Wormword's attempt to make his ""patient"" fall away from the faith. Through Screwtape's letters, we see a broad range of topics discussed including coming to faith, life in the faith community, love and sex, and other ideas on life. These topics make interesting reading when discussed from the perspective of how to fail in your faith.The Screwtape Letters at times are a tedious read as nothing really happens in the story. The good thing is that it is a short read. It never hurts to think a little more about your faith."
4,An excellent read -- enchanting look at an old subject.,"Lewis handles an age old subject in a new light that only he could manage. While injected with humor, the subject matter is also very serious at the same time. A must for every C.S. Lewis fan."
5,Amazing Book!,I just love reading anything by CS Lewis. Very insightful and enjoyable as it is written in a fictional exchange between two demons.
5,Very Insightful,"This book will really make you think. It addresses our human traits in a very unique way. A very interesting way to relate to God,s desires for us and how there are evil influences on our lives."
2,The Screwtape Letters,"The book The Screwtape Letters is written for a more mature reader, one that is interested in philosophical thinking. The book is more a theological book, than an exciting book. I would not suggest this book for a high school student. Not that it is too complicated for a teenager to read, because the story is easy to understand and follow. The book was dull, the author could not keep my attention or interest, because there was little action or excitement. Although I found it dull the book is well written, the writing style is very creative. The story makes the reader think about their one life. The ""patient"" represents the every day man, therefore the situations in the book parallel people's own life experiences."
2,The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis,"In my perspective of reading The Screwtape Letters, I found the book being very repetitive to the point where it took the excitement away from the book. Don't get me wrong the book dealt with many social issues that we as individuals undergo each and everyday of our lives. Just because I wasn't overly excited with The Screwtape Letters shouldn't hender one from reading this book. On the other hand, reading The Screwtape Letters could encourage or help someone through their troubling times."
1,Too heavy for summer,"This book was the selection for my reader's group this month and I must say, no offense to the member who picked it, that I couldn't get pass the third chapter. It's just a little too heavy for a summer read. It is problably best left for a person who is in the mood to delve into the corruption of human nature. Maybe I'll get back to it when the weather is dreary and I am already depressed."
1,Screw these letters,"Another step in the Christian brain-washing process. If you enjoy seeing intellectual inquiry portrayed as sin, you'll love this book."
3,Interesting but drags on a bit.,I read this book in High School and loved it. I reread it recently at age 64 and found it far less facinating. Perhaps the cleverness of Mr Lewis approach has less impact on those of us that have become cynical with the passage of time. This is probably a good book for discussion groups - there is a lot here that will prompt debate!
4,screwtape,The condition of the book was just as described prior to purchase. The shipment arrived in a very timely manner. Very happy with it.
5,Thought provoking. Different view point.,This was a very different book from anything I've ever read. It's literally a literary devil's advocate speaking from the character Wormwood.
4,Screwtape Letters,I read this book many years ago but didn't have it in my personal library. So I put it on my wish list. My son saw it and even though I didn't know it comes on Kindle he sent the Kindle version to me for a birthday present. That is a great idea and fast and convenient since he lives so far away from me.
3,Postal Service screw-up,"When I received my package, it looked like it had been left in the rain and run over...quite literally, it was a jumbled mess. It was no fault of this seller though, my beef is really with the US Postal service, they were completely unhelpful. Not much that can be done about that, very disappointed..."
2,Some wit and insight but way too repetitive. Mostly for Christian readers.,"It seems here like everybody absolutely loves this book. Whilte it does have some witty moments of insight, I found the book to be enormously overrated.The allegorical form of writing, as letters from a demon to another demon, gets old pretty quickly and it gets extremely repetetive and frankly quite boring. Way too much time is spent on how to tempt humans away from Christianity, and to a non-Christian, those long portions of texts are completely uninteresting.Lewis does make some good points about human behaviour in general that are both witty and insightful, but those are exceptions and for the most part ""The Screwtape Letters"" is quite boring. The novella would have been good if it was about one third as long and not be so centered on Christianity. Christians will probably enjoy it more than I did, though."
1,THe Screwtape Letters,not interested in books about Satin. Hard to get past that first chapter. held no interest for me. won't recommend it.
2,"Well-Written, But Extremely Boring","...It is very well-written, and the premise is interesting. However, I found it so boring I could hardly pay attention. C.S. Lewis does make some good points, but he really beats them to death. The reason I'm rating the book two stars instead of one is that it really is very well-written, in spite of being extremely boring."
5,The subtle temptations of Evil.,"This allegory is both a hilarious and unsettling examination of the pitfalls that can trip up ANY Christian (irregardless of denomination) during his or her walk of faith. Again and again the administrative devil Screwtape offers advises to his novice nephew Wormwood on how best to distract, trip-up, or out and out blind a patient (Lewis's term for the human victim of the devil's temptations). Each letter is a microscopic examination on a worldly weakness, or strength, that can be slowly twisted and, without the patient being truly aware of it, lead him off the path to salvation. Anybody on the Christian path will no doubt chuckle and relate to these temptations, easily seeing his or her self facing the problematic issues that Screwtape urges Wormwood to exploit. I find it hard to believe that this book's of examination of faith and belief and how human weakness can either undermine or strengthen both can be surpassed, either in fiction or non. An essential book."
5,Read it more than once for best understanding!,"Although this is a book for Christians to understand how the Devil thinks. I think it also sets the record straight for any reader. There is a Devil, and he will trick you any way he can!"
4,Trippy,"It's kinda wild, but a great read. I love CS Lewis' style of writing and, as specifically evidenced here, his keen insight into humanity and the way we live our lives. It is a fictional (or at least hypothetical) story, but quite powerful."
4,Screwtape Letters,"My time is so limited, I have read only 2 chapters & liked them. Still looking for a time to sit down & read more."
2,Very deep book,This book wasn't for me. It was too metaphorical which made it hard for me to read and follow.It would be good for people who like this type of writing. Read the first few pages and see what you think.
3,Thought provoking,I was introduced to this book in a Sunday School class. Opened my eyes to an interesting concept about how The Evil One works his way into the human mind. It is a tough read. I have set it down a couple times.
4,by Kevin,Enjoyable recording and a reasonable value. The novel presentation of spiritual warfare through this perspective allows one to reflect on life's choices and their potential consequences. It reminds me of the concept that lies do not come in colors and all sins lead in the same direction.
5,John Cleese interprets CS Lewis' Screwtape perfectly.,"I have read The Screwtape Letters probably a dozen times. I was very excited to find John Cleese doing an audio tape of the book - having listened to too many Monty Python records (I said records! not CDs!!) The combination is exciting and excellent.Mr. Cleese really gets into the character of Screwtape, a senior devil, as he attempts to educate and train his ""nephew"", a junior devil. His nuances and inflections lend a force to the writings. At times angry, surprised, and at others comtemplative, he brings a very good book further to life. Having read the book a number of times, he does my favorite passages very well."
2,This was a very hard book to follow,"Self-proclaimed, I am not the brightest light in the chandelier, but I struggled with the symbolism in this book. I enjoy allegories, but this was just way too far out for me. I believe to better enjoy this book, you have to have someone to study it with. It is definitely not for pleasure reading. Love other CS Lewis work, but not this one."
5,Old Friend,The book is every bit as entertaining and enlightening as when I first read it some fifty years ago.
5,Screwtape Letters,"An excellent book which shows how the ""other side"" thinks. Great writing! One of my favorites!"
5,Funny (and Serious) as Hell !,"Like all Lewis' works, this book is full of insights into human life - into those aspects which are often too big and obvious for us to notice. These insights are given us directly from the enemy through the writings of a devil named Screwtape. He writes to his nephew (a novice tempter devil) about his nephew's ""patient,"" a human struggling with faith, who is a representation of us. This book bettered my attitudes about people and life and faith by orders of magnitude! I recommend it to everyone!!"
4,Screwtape is an incredible look into philosophy,"I first read this book when I was 12, and it helped to guide me on my own spiritual journey. It touched my very soul as very few other books have done. Especially in today's society, guidance, with a touch of humor, is necessary in order to cope. For the young, Screwtape will help you to begin your live with the Lord. For those of us who are more ""seasoned"", it will carry you along in your journey and bring you closer to the goal we all have.Along with this there is a wonderful companion book which I can't recommend highly enough. Where Screwtape leaves off, ""The Michael Letters"" takes over. It's almost as if the author has known me for years. I would recommend reading both, in conjunction with each other, as you will benefit from hearing ""both sides"" of the battle for our souls.The Michael Letters: Heaven's answer to Screwtape"
5,Origional and Insightful,"C.S. Lewis' 'Screwtape Letters' gives true insight on both faith and the human condition.Lewis shows off some of his most inventive story telling in his postal service tale between a Devil(Screwtape) and his nephew (wormwood).This book give perfect insight to the nature of Satan and the hungering forces of evil, while including a refined English charm to his characters. He takes the dark side and adds a bit of hillarity to it; making this a slightly sinister dark comedy and a truely beautiful peice of literature that is both well written and inspirational to its audience.C.S. Lewis' wit, charm and intellect is perfectly reflected in this novel. No wonder it has remained a classic of his writtings."
5,Superb,You've got to read the Screwtape Letters!It's fascinating. The spiritual insights are so rich and deep.You'll never think about spiritual evil the same way again.
3,"Good, but heavy read","I found this a heavy book to read due to the language used (i.e., I had to look up quite a few words to understand their meaning), and I didn't really like seeing half the conversation between Uncle Screwtape and his nephew Wormwood.I did like the book. I just feel like you need to read through it more than once and study it in relationship to the New Testament to fully understand the tactics the demons used against their subject. The book makes numerous assumptions about New Testament theology that a reader may not recognize or fully understand.I would really like to include this book in an upcoming Bible class and talk about it with others to explore all the ways Lewis proposes that Satan tempts us."
4,This Novel Draws Back The Curtain,"This is a novel that lets the reader see behind the veil separating this world from our the ""other"" world. It is an amazing piece of work for C.S. Lewis; a real triumph for those who want to see true evil exposed.Parts of the novel can become slightly confusing to a reader unfamiliar with the time-period in which C.S. Lewis uses as a backdrop to this story...but other than that one drawback, it is an awesome piece of work.www.therunninggirl.com"
3,"Electronic Version of Lewis' ""Screwtape Letters""","I liked the fact that I could download this quickly onto my PC, read it and make virtual marks on it for where I left off. What I do not like about is that the pages numbers of the book were not visible on the screen."
2,Not for me,I know this is a classic. I know I should have loved it. I just didn't. No connection for me; though I was appreciative that it was available on kindle so readers could decide for themselves.
5,The Screwtape Letters audio book,"Pretty good version. The vocal quality of the performer was good, but somewhat nasal.Overall, great audio book for the students."
5,Wow.,"The genius of this book astounds me. C.S. Lewis is somehow able to teach valuable lessons on every page while speaking as a demon. And it makes you laugh, too. The reader is smiling one moment and squirming at an uncomfortable recognition of self the next. The book is fairly short and could be a quick read, but you will want to stop and digest each letter for a while before moving on to the next. Excellent for a study group.Amanda Hamm, author ofDear Jane Letters"
5,Awesome Classic,"The Screwtape Letters is an ingenious piece of work...as expected from such an extraordinary author as C. S. Lewis! It was convicting, interesting, and an enjoyable read."
5,Fascinating novel with rich characterizations,This is a classic piece of Christian fiction. You will not be disappointed but challenged after reading this delightful book.
4,Fanatastic Book!,The Screwtape Letters: I had read this book before and liked it so much I wanted to buy it and have it in my home.
5,Great book!,"I've read this book, and I think it is a book everyone should read. A great piece of literature with a different point of view."
3,C.S. Lewis the intellect,"C.S. Lewis has devised a humorous, satircal novel; yet also one that sadly and painfully hits close to home. He has cleverly and novelly set up his book as a series of letters that the ""Devil"" writes to his nephew who is learning the trade. Many of the tactics used by the Devil become painfully clear to the reader and provokes deep thinking and questioning. Overall many letters contained strong, learning themes yet the overall presentation of ideas, although creative and unique, may have contributed to the overall lack of unity in the novel. I felt it read more like an essay than a novel. Overall though, the ideas were strong and poignant and stimulated thinking yet the setup perhaps hindered the developemnt of lasting impressions from the novel. As you read it, you gained insight, yet because the points were stated and then immdietely abandonded, it is hard to imagine this novel as leaving deep impressions in the mind."
3,Ant's Review,"The CD sounds great, but I was was expecting the single version of Regina's Baby Love instead of a dance remix."
4,A GREAT MIX OF DANCE HITS,"This is a fabulous mix of songs but it doesn't sound remastered. Other than that, enjoy the tunes."
5,The cry of the blackmailer is heard in an English village.,"Miss Silver always gives good advice--and afterwards, she has as consolation that she did try to help. ""Don't blackmail murderers,"" is one of her prime mottoes. But no one ever listens, thank goodness, and we get another story of murder, young love, and village characters."
1,TERRIBLE FILM. TERRIBLE TRANSFER. Save your money!,"I'm a fan of cheesy, low budget movies, but this TRULY is an unwatchable film. The transfer to DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen. Color is bleached out beyond belief, soundtrack is garbled, overall DVD quality is one of the worst I've ever seen. Save your money, or you'll regret this purchase, just like I have. It's in my Goodwill pile."
2,"Great Movie, poor quality",I always loved this picture. Joe is a great actor in my opinion. Ann has always been my favorite sex symbol. I am not sure why the quality of the picture is so poor. This was filmed in 1970 and it looks like a home move shot on 9 mm. If only someone could enhance this and find the missing scenes. There are a number of scenes that are cut from this film. It almost looks like the manufacturer set a video camera in front of a television and filmed an edited version. Many of the initial scenes are too dark to see.
3,Product Review,"This is another movie that would be much better if it would be digitally enhanced. It's a good 60's motorcycle movie, with some good music. I am a William Smith fan. He does a great bad guy motorcyclist. Joe Namath and Ann Margret do a good job as well."
1,No good!,"Stay away from this one! the video transfer sucks, PLUS, it was edited so it lacks the nudity scene. Total play time is 84 min, not 90 or 94 as per their listing."
5,c c and company,this movie is a good motorcycle movie . it was made back a pretty good time ago.a lot of the actors are old now
1,Bad DVD,This DVD wouldn't play at all. My husband was so happy to get it and so disappointed when it wouldn't play.
1,BAD QUALITY,I was very disappointed with the DVD. It looks like it was copied from a bad VHS tape. I remember seeing the movie at the theatre when it first came out and although it isn't a great movie it was still fun to watch at the time. I think there is a love scene missing between Joe and Ann also but I may be mistaken. If the DVD was better in quality my review would be much better.
3,C.C and Company DVD,"I liked the video, overall. The quality was good, but not great. I hated continuously seeing company logo in the lower right hand corner. Too bad it wasn't in letter box."
5,Hilarious look back in time,It was filmed in Tucson where I live. I read about this movie on a yahoo website called Vanishing Tucson and I love motocross so it was truly fun to watch!!!!
3,"Don't hold this movie, Norwood or Last Rebel against Joe Willie, pls....","He had just won the biggest game in ProFootball history, Super Bowl III and wasa hot property! I like his costar(s) th-ough! Agent Jimmy Walsh (see vulgar book'Namath') got him the gigs. The best pl-ayer in American Football League history,look for the History of the AFL video,sorry not on DVDs. Get it while you can!"
5,Very Good Case,"This is the first ""universal"" case I've gotten, so I have no experience with any other cases. It works great for my needs. I was looking for something fairly compact that would help keep my mp3 player and accessories (Which include the headphones, docking cable, charger and armband) organized during trips. This does the job very well, although does not leave a whole lot of room for much else.The Koskin (""leather"") look is part of the reason I bought the case. The spine and sides of the case seem to be made of a durable cardboard that give good structure to it. The sides do flex a little, so although this case will protect what is in it to a degree, it will not keep things from being crushed.I bought mine directly from the Case Logic website (Which seems to have stopped selling them for some reason). When it arrived, it was in great condition. I find it unfair to down grade this product due to Amazon's or others' storage practices, and find nothing wrong with the product itself."
5,The Best Fu Manchu songs i've ever heard,"The First two songs are really great, and i'm not a big fu manchu fan but these songs are great and the Black Flag cover is also cool. Very Recommendable."
3,"not bad, a little expensive","For the money, not worth it. I noticed a little difference. Not what I was expecting. They are better than the factory halogen bulbs"
4,Headlights.,"New, slightly better in price when I got them. Put them in, adjusted, and worked out nicely. Great upgrade from my old ones. If your looking to upgrade an old cars headlights, then try these."
3,beware of buying refurbished products,"Apparently, the items i ordered were refurbished. Guess the price was too good to be true. My repair shop has a automobile design engineer who works in his father's shop. He told me that most of the stuff online was refurbished and that originals only come from dealers. He also showed me how to identify if it was refurbished. The plugs were not completely clean. they had burn marks on them."
2,Not what I want,"I am disappointed that the content doesn't match the title of the DVD. The conference was not recorded in a professional way, the sound quality is not too good."
2,Not very helpful for helping an expert set their fees,"This book was not exactly what I expected. I expected more narrative and less statistical reporting. I wanted detailed written input as to procedures already in practice by experts , and also how to identify pricing schedules and contracting policies that will work for you. I did not gleen very much from this book."
2,Not a good value,The information in this book is available on the net in other areas and not for the high price I paid for the book. The information is not what is touted in the advertisement. I would advise anyone to be forgo purchasing this item.
5,Excellent Resource,"This is an excellent resource for expert witnesses and those that use their services. If you are not in one of those two groups, it may not be useful to you. If you are in those groups, the detailed information is well worth the cost. In fact, if you put just a few of the ideas into action, it may save you many, many times the cost of the book. It is no wonder that so many copies of this niche book have been sold."
1,Not good,"I bought this bodysuit for my daughter. A few weeks after we bought it, she went to use it for an occasion and it was very sheer. She couldn't wear it. I contacted the seller but the seller did not respond."
2,Buyer Beware:Hugely Disappointed...,"Great song selection, but none of them are in their entirety. Not fair! Should have been a warning. I wanted the full length versions. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
1,Wish I heard it,Never got a chance to hear it because it was defected ordered again and it came defected.
1,a bad cd,The lineup of songs is terrific but each song pauses before moving onto the next track. Not professionally done that's my only quip about this cd.
3,Celtic snooze,"This album brings together a sterling group of musicians and some terrific material, but I felt that the results added up to less than the sum of the parts. The traditional tracks, in general, are performed with zest as well as sensitivity, and some of the new traditional-style tunes (e.g., the ""After the Fleadh"" set) are fun to listen to. And the quality of the musicians' performances is excellent throughout. On the other hand, I felt that the improvised tracks were comparatively weak: Winter's improvisations seem to have fallen into a rut (the melodies all tend to follow the same slowly rising pattern), and when the same arrangements reappear in the non-improvised pieces (e.g., ""Golden Apples of the Sun""), the album becomes repetitious -- my reaction to the two reprise tracks at the end was ""Oh gawd, not again!!"" The album is pleasant and makes good background music, but as a listening experience I found it more sleep-inducing than stimulating."
4,Emergency paddle.,"I store 2 of these in my jetski for emergencies only. They seem perfect for emergency use. I fit two paddles in one bag, no problem."
2,Building Green monster...,"The ideas are great, however I wouldn't put ""green"" in the title. Some of the choice of materials isn't green, but what bothered me the most is the size of the house that was built as green. You can't build a castle and still call it green! The use of steal and concrete isn't green either.It wasn't all bad. There was some useful information so I gave it 2 stars."
3,melodies from Dylan's John Wesley Harding,"I heard several melodies lifted from John Wesley Harding (Dreamed I Saw St Augustine, I'll be Your Baby Tonight among others). So if you like this record, you should check out that one. It will seem like you've heard it before. I didn't hear much that compared with his best Moby Grape stuff. Of course he lifted Motorcycle Irene from Charlie Rich's Mohair Sam. Spence certainly had good taste."
2,hummmmmmm..es loco o se hace?????????',"sinceramente, no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas, incluso renombrados artistas, hacia este musico... ungido de la leyenda GRAPE, amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura, esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima, piedad, curiosidad...no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson (13th.....).. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin, son opiniones, nada mas."
3,Over Revered,"This is an album that is considered a classic of the psychedelic era. I tend to disagree. It never did sell well but has gained a cult following over the years. The one problem with it is Spence's vocals. This is a fact that people tend to overlook when reviewing this album. The vocals are way too flat and without expression. The song writing is first rate although and the album deserves high marks for creativity. It is too bad about the vocals, because at times this is a very inspiring and interesting piece of work, probably due in part to Spence's LSD experimentation. While perhaps not a classic, it does deserve attention and should have a place in rock history."
1,He's Up A Creek Without One,"Spence, like Tim Buckley in his later years, is a reminder that most experiments fail. Give him a star for taking chances, but hey, that still only gives him one star."
1,I bought this based on others reviews but...,This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better.
3,a 60's acid casualty,"I think this stuff is pretty interesting. It's got a good vibe, sound, and is pretty interesting to listen to given its history. I'll say this though, the music for me, lacks any real hooks or melody that resonates in me. The vocals sound good, but they're kind of breathy, and the music kind of drifts and flows. Also, there's nothing lyrically that really jumps out at me either. I guess out of all the 60's madcaps I prefer Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett to this. I would suggest that someone get this album though. It's really peaceful sounding, and has a very warm feel to it. The liner notes are incredible, and the music does hit the spot at some points. But to be fair there's no way I can call this a five star album."
5,One of the best album's I've ever heard...,What can I say about this album? Just buy it. It is one of the most moving pieces of work I've heard ever. I've been telling everyone I know to buy it. Please just do. When you hear this album you'll know why it is a legend. Just put it on - turn the lights off - and close your eyes. You can almost see Skip singing around a camp fire. Or singing on a old house's porch in a thunderstorm. Just get it and be one of the lucky few to see why this album is one of the best ever.
3,Not all stainless,The ball itself is good and will not rust. But the nut and lock washer will. After one winter the nut is rusted. Totally dumb.
1,Very low quality,got rusted in a week of instalation and they assure no rust for life . Do yourself a favor Do not buy
1,kINDLE VERSION IS NOT READABLE,"I once ordered one copy of its kindle version and it's totally unreadable. Be careful. My rate is not actually for the book, instead is for the kindle version of the book. The publisher shall be more careful for this issues such as figure quality, layout, etc."
1,Bad horror. Not in a good way.,"First, let me say that I love bad horror. I really, really love bad horror. But this film was awful. It wasn't quite over the top enough to make it entertainingly bad, the characters were too ridiculous to care about at all, and it was boring. There was no sense of threat at all in this film, given how absolutely ridiculous the aswangs are (again, not in a funny/entertaining way). Save your money."
3,Change the Title...,"This movie was ok, if you are into low budget horrer films. If you are interested in REAL Aswangs, this movie doesn't even come close. It was obvious not a lot of research was done, if any. I know someone that killed one. The ""UnEarthing"" is a much better title for this movie."
1,Out of date,"Just out of curiosity it may be worth skimming through its pages, but the way Mr Baird used to trade in the past (with sheets to get ur position from) is far away from how this is done today. Hence, do not surprise yourself if discussions such as smile delta and smile gamma do not come into play."
2,nope!,pretty outdated... the ratio of the added value of the book to the time spent to read it is far below than i expected..
1,not worth buying,"10 or 20 pages of nice graphs worth copying and keeping on your desk, otherwise really generic, should be kept for reading in the subway"
2,Moosaic: Perspectives On Investing,"The book has some good points, but it was way too expensive. The Price means it is not worth it, save your cash and buy four books for the price of one. The book has also not aged well."
5,Words of Wisdom from one of the Best!!!,"Mohnish Pabrai at the time of this post currently manages about $260 million in his hedge funds using a value approach. His returns place him in the top 1% of money managers. If you ever get a chance to go to one of his annual meetings you'll realize what a truely exceptional investment manager he is. Like any investing book, do not expect to be able to read this book and make any money. Instead, this is a compilation of many short articles that he has written which form the basis for his investment approach. Do also realize that most of his actions and analysis that he employs are at a much higher intellectual level than the discussions in this book, which are mainly geared to the average individual. You may or may not agree with his strategy, but his record speaks for itself. If you don't agree that this is an exceptional book, then let's see you outperform his accomplishments and write your own book..."
2,A CD of Sample Disco Songs,"The sound quality, (bad) and the song lengths (very short, some are 2:00 minutes long) was very disappointing for me. If all you want is what I stated in the aforementioned sentence then this is the CD for you otherwise find another CD that have these songs, even if it is less, hoping the song quality does not sound like a bad duplication as this one does."
1,Disappointing CD,If you are looking for full length versions of the songs named in the track listing ~ Save your money & time because they are not on this CD. The quality is substandard. And the songs are overlapped/mixed ~ meaning there is no 2 or 3 second pause between the songs. They are just on top of each other. I don't like this CD at all. And what's up with that artwork???? The insert that is the so-called track listing is ILLEGIBLE. I am very dissapointed with this product and feel misled.
1,rip off,"the quality on the tracks seems am radio quality! the cd label is made in a inkjet printer , the print on the cd looks and feels home made, i dont know how amazon sells stuff that im sure is piracy!!"
3,"Huge bag, tight fit with battery grip","This bag is much bigger than I expected but just isn't quite roomy enough to comfortably hold a 35mm Canon EOS Rebel Ti with a battery grip, hand strap and small lens attached. It just doesn't seem to be designed with the optional standard Canon battery grips and hand straps in mind. The bag is attractive, however, and appears sturdy and well-padded but its bulk (some of which is from the rear pouch storing the belt strap when not in use) can also make it a bit awkward. Its not a bad camera bag for the price but you may want to consider something else if you plan on using a battery grip.Post Script - This bag turns out to be a pretty good fit for the Canon Rebel XT with the caveat that you'll only be able to fit the one zoom lens and no other lenses or a flash unit. Even with the XT's smaller size, however, the bag is still a too tight of a fit for an XT with a battery grip attached."
5,Perfect for my T1i and Tamron 18-270,"Fits my Canon EOS T1i with an attached Tamron 18-270 lens and strap. Zips closed with hood on in reverse mode or just velcros closed with hood on in shooting mode (eyepeice about 1"" above zipper). This is with padded divider velcroed in place at the very bottom of case to provide extra cushion for lens in the event of a drop. Placing the divider there should address any padding issues and make this one of the best padded cases where it counts. Also holds extra batteries in side pocket and cards in top pocket. Belt, contrary to what I've read, slips back into pocket in about 10 seconds (unclasped). Little room for much else, but that's ok. My only concern is that I'd like some verification that it is manufactured under humane working conditions -- but I've seen no such verification for any competing products either."
2,weird color and too bulky,"I bought this for my Canon Rebel XSI after reading mixed reviews. I returned it however because it is way to bulky and the color is really ugly. I decided to buy the Tamrac 5501 Explorer 1 Camera Bag instead which is the SAME SIZE and fits way more stuff inside because of it's design and many, many pockets!"
2,Canon EOS 50D does not fit well,"Perhaps I missed this but I thought this case would accommodate the CANON 50D. At any rate, if you are buying this case for the Canon 50D the fit is VERY tight, need two hands to place in case and secure it (not very functional for quick uses. Difficult to get camera strap inside case, need to squeeze it in, placing it against view screen. Padding is fair, other cases much better.I do not know how well the rebel fits in this case and may work fine for that camera frame"
3,Not what I was looking for..........,"The issue I have with this bag is that if you have a battery grip on your camera, it a very very tight fit. It's a well but together bag, but it's not setup for a camera with a battery grip on it."
4,Small and handy case,This is a great small case perfect for the minimalists who only wants to carry the bare essentials. It has a nice strap and storage room that is perfect for a Cannon rebel camera and the recharging pack. It's a great buy for someone that has a Cannon rebel camera
4,holster pac k - the way to go,Athough this case is a bit heavier and bulkier than I would like it is well padded and rugged and will wear well. It has little niches for small accessories. I would reccommend it to anyone. Holster type is the way to go for the bulkier digital reflex cameras. With the longer lenses they tend to hang lens down anyway (go with the flow!) I use it with the belt rather than the shoulder strap.
4,Size does matter...,I purchased this case for my 500D... But when I upgraded my camera to 5D this case was not quite appropriate. So it is not universal enough...
5,perfect for my t4i,"The only thing I don't like is that there's plenty of room on the sides to add additional storage, but I love this case and the optional ways to carry it."
4,Perfect for EOS cameras !,This case perfectly fits my EOS 50D .It is easy to carry and has optional pockets for memory card and batteries.
5,It fits Great with macro lenses!!,"Its perfect for having the camera with a macro lens (USM 2.8 100mm), normally i have to take the lens off with others holders, but with this one it fits perfect, the materials are high quality and it feels safe and sturdy."
4,Not as large as it seems.,"This is a great looking pack for a camera but it's not as large as it seems. The product description says ""made to hold a Canon full-size DSLR camera with an attached lens"", but in fact it was a very tight fit for my 7D with an 28-135mm lens. I returned the pack and order the Canon 2400 bag."
5,Perfect Fit,"I read reviews that almost made me change my mind about ordering this bag. But it fits great and has enough storage to keep it light, which was the reason we ordered it. We have a EOS Rebel T1i and the fit is perfect. The shoulder strap seems nice, nothing amazing but works good. I will admit what other reviewers noted, the green color on the bottom is pretty ugly, but I'm a guy, I don't need it to be pretty!"
4,Good quality product,"I have used this for over 6 months now with my rebel XS and have taken it on several trips. Quality is great for the price, couldnt ask for better. Looks good too, light weight and rugged enough. I just use the standard lens and so there is some room at the top of the case which I could use for something. But I've found its a pain everytime you need to take the camera out. Maybe they could have made the pocket on the underside of the top flap a little deeper to be able to hold something bigger."
4,This camera bag is required for hiking with your camera.,"Originally I ordered a camera bag that fit all my lenses and other accessories which is also really needed but it is too big to easily carry around when you are walking and taking pictures. So, I ordered this holster style bag and found it to be just what I needed - it is bigger than the point and shoot on my belt but it is not very heavy. You can either carry it over your shoulder or around your waist with the included strap. You must have this bag If you walk or hike and take pictures.It has quality construction and was a very good purchase."
5,Canon Zoom Pack,"This is exactly what i was looking for. It's not too big nor too small, not to mention that it's very stylish. It's great for the Rebel series. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough padding on the inside to protect my camera and accessories but it's great! I'd say it's worth the price you pay. It's comfortable to wear and stays safely attached to your body. This product won't disappoint!"
2,Frays,Okay product but there is a lot of fraying around the top of the pack. I was expecting something more with a Canon badge on it.
2,Too big for a compact SLR,"Canon should design a bag for just one COMPACT Rebel SLR with one lens attached and a second lens. The Zoom Pack 1000 ""Holster"" name implies a good fit, and a Canon Rebel T2i/550D just flops around inside."
1,Too high for quality,This product is prices extremely high for quality. I rate it a zero Sip and solve book
4,For the new bridge player,"Tips right in front of you, help remind you and your partner about bidding. A good tool for the beginner. I used one of these 50 years ago when I was first learning bridge and I am glad they are still available."
2,Did not get what I ordered,I ordered this Ford Logo decal for my truck. It clearly shows the Ford letters with an oval around it in the picture but whe nI recieved my package there was no oval. I am not very happy about this.
1,Awful movie!,"This movie does not deserve even 1 star. The story is boring and what makes it even worse is that the ""special"" effects are from the 90s and the dialog is totally stupid. There is a reason why you cannot see a preview of the movie before purchasing. Nobody would buy it."
3,Good mix of PC and Embedded,"The hardware details provides a good detail of general techniques and parts. However the software sections leave much to be desired, c'mon Visual Basic? Really great for beginners and novices, experts are best to save their money."
4,Serious On Serial (SOS),"The book should find space on the shelf of anyone interested in interfacing a Windows PC to another device using the serial port. Do you want to communication with a microcontroller or other embedded processor? Here it is. Axelson spends time covering information that you simply will not find elsewhere. Her BASIC Stamp program example is an illustration of this detail. Also covered are details on RS-422/RS-485, cabling, etc."
3,"Nice intro to hardware, poor software coverage","This is a nice book if you want a basic introduction to the serial port from a hardware/circuits point of view. Primary coverage is on the RS232 and RS485, but there is information relevant to other serial standards as well. There is also information for serial communications using microcontrollers such as the 8052 and Basic Stamp; surprisingly NONE of the popular Motorola series (mc68hc11, hc12, hc16, etc) are covered.The glaring weakness of the book is the software coverage, which uses Visual Basic. Why use such an arcane and limited language? Very few engineers and techies use VB, so the majority of the intended audience will miss out on about half of the book. This is a shame since reading code for serial programming gives tremendous insight into what is really happening. This book would be useful to many more people had it been written in a standard language such as C or Java or even assembly."
2,Quite disapponting....,"This book can give you basic knowledge which is helpful for new VB programmer on serial port communication. However, if you are trying to find sth related to RS485 communication, you will be disappointed becasue the example is no longer suitable nowadays. Try technical notes from device manufacturer on the web is a better solution."
2,This book is mostly fluff,"What do you expect from an author who admits in print that her favorite language is BASIC? I found more useful information after an hour's search of the web than can be extracted from this painful text. As far as I can tell, this book was about 10 pages long before the Visual Basic listings and irrelevant information about various microcontrollers was added. Save your money."
2,Not worth it,"This book is quite disappointing. It's coverage is both narrow and shallow. If you're after some code to do serial programming from Visual Basic it's probably ok, but any different or deeper than that, you're better off with what you'll find on Google."
2,Wasn't that helpful ...,The examples in this book were too advanced for the project I was working on. In the end it was just a waste of time. I wish I'd spent my money on a book more suitible to my needs. Nuff said.
4,Title Matches Content,"I bought the book hoping that it would cover RS-485 well enough for me to use it as a reference for my next project. I wasn't disappointed. It has all the needed information.The really nice thing I didn't expect was the helpful ""guidelines for trouble-free RS-485 links"", which included hints on how to deal with cable delay, impedance, termination, reflections, noise, topologies, circuit protection, etc...I'm not sure how some of these other reviewers were disappointed. The book is very detailed (for the expert), but still easy to read (for the beginner). There is information about how to use microcontrollers and PCs, but it doesn't come at the cost of information on serial communication. In fact, I found that some of the examples using microcontrollers gave me a few ideas for my project.( )BASIC is a completely logical language to use for showing examples in this book. It is simple and concise. Anyone who complains about it is a zealot, fighting some language war."
2,Printhead failures common?,"I've had this printer for over a year now and for the past 6 months, the print quality has been terrible. This month, it won't print at all and I've been told I need to buy a new printhead which will cost at least $70. I've tried cleaning the printhead, doing any possible maintenance I could and none of this helped. I have always used Canon ink cartridges and never abuse this printer. Reading the last review makes me wonder if it will be worth it to replace the printhead or just invest in a new printer. I've never had a printhead problem with any other printer I've owned (at least 3 others over a span of several years)."
3,printhead problem,"I've had the Canon MP730 printer for over a year and up til now have LOVED it. Its very easy to use for scanning, faxing, copying and printing. However, a week ago the print quality began deteriorating and even though there is ink in all the cartridges, yellow and blue don't print well. I've cleaned the nozzles, realigned the print and even reseated the printhead. Nothing resulted in any positive changes. I'm a little concerned about spending $70 on a new printhead when I've read that other people have replaced it only to have it malfunction in a few short months..."
3,Problems with printhead too,"I'm afraid I will add to the list of people experiencing problems with the MP700 printhead. After all sort of tries, I am now at the point where I decided to buy a new printer rather than a new printhead. And I am not taking a Canon as it is the second time I experience critical problems with them (feed with BJC6000, and printhead with MP700), despite a great grace period where I was pleased with the overall perfomance and user interface to the printer. To be fully honest, I havbe to admit I also refilled my cartridges with supposedly compatible ink, so this could possibly have had an effect on the poor head !"
3,Great until printhead went south,"Add me to the list of people who loved this printer when it worked. My black is the only color that went out, but I do a serious amount of text printing. I couldn't tell you how many thousands of pages I've printed. I think I'm going to buy a laser multifunction and then get a dedicated photoprinter."
1,sounds like a cat dying,"He has a whiny voice, but the background music is very soothing. He just has the same songs over and over again. Absolutely no variation whatsoever!!"
5,Erin weaves a wonderful web!,"Erin Hamiltion (Carol Burnett's daughter, for those not in the know) doesn't so much remake this song as recreate, revitalize, and reenergize it, making it into an instant dancefloor classic. I bought Erin's CD ""One World"" after hearing this song off the ""Trick"" soundtrack, and found that EVERY song packs the same powerful punch as ""Dream Weaver."" You won't be disappointed."
2,Don't start here,"This was the first ZF album that disappointed me. Earlier releases felt like bulletins from a parallel world - this one sounds like creative people playing with new toys. The technology is way out front, calling attention to itself. Also, there's a reliance on harsh machine sounds looped endlessly for no reason. If you're new to this band, I'd recommend anything from 1983-1988:MOHNOMISHE (83)EOSTRE (84)POPULAR SOVIET SONGS AND YOUTH MUSIC (85)LOH LAND (recorded 85, released 87)MISFITS LOONY TUNES AND SQUALID CRIMINALS (86)ASSAULT AND MIRAGE (recorded 86, released 87)A FLOCK OF ROTATIONS (87)SHOUTING AT THE GROUND (88)"
4,The mysterious engine towards nightmares,"This is a startling CD. For the most part, this is the definition of machine music. Sounds like loops of compactors/crushers and going on with minimal yet audible ( after a few listens ) signs of any other more synthetic sounds are heard. But inbetween these are the sounds of what I think is Middle Eastern instrumentation which is really beautiful.....it gives this album an exotic touch. On first listen, this is a exhausting listen. It almost has a dehumanizing aspect. But with a few more listens there's some slight cases of something, if not more accessible, then clearly more audible to enhance a mood. If you enjoy the more experimental stuff, this is the record for you"
2,Rocky Horror - From Cult to Concept.,"""Rocky Horror: From Cult to Concept"", a collection of pattering interviews with nearly everyone ever remotely involved with Richard O'Brien's cult phenom, is for completeist's only. Die Hard Rocky fan's (already well versed in the history of the musical sensation) will no doubt appreciate the chats with some of the more obscure player's (Peter Hinwood, who played the titular character in the 1975 film version proves a particularly pleasant character) but those looking for in depth insight into Rocky's early beginnings in London are advised to look elsewhere. Very little time is spent discussing the shows humble birth at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs."
2,"Lot's of talk, but no delivery","I was disappointed with the delivery of this book based on the title. The only part I liked was the Thomas Aquinas part. There is nothing scientific about it. I expected more form Rupert being a biologist. Where's the Physics??? The authors assume alot but back none of their assumptions up. This book is so flawed on the angel debate, I could be here all day. It really annoys me when authors spew out thoughts and ramble on but don't offer any evidence. The pages on Satan & the dark angels are utterly laughable!!! These guys should of done alot more research!!! There's nothing here I didn't know already but I sure wish I was there when they were doing this book so I could correct them on the blatant mistakes & contradictions they made."
4,Meets my needs,"The Freeplay works simply and elegantly, is user friendly, and is better than previous competitors."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I recently purchased this product because a guy I worked with had one. He had raved about the fact that he didn't have to charge it for a week. I received this product and have found that I must charge it every day! I listen to 2 AM radio stations for approximately 5 hours out of the day. After one day of listening, they just fade and I'm usually unable to pick them back up. If I do, they fade away within minutes again. I've cranked this radio 90-100 times (figuring this would be approx 30-45 min playing time) when it fades and it usually fades way before it should. For the price and time/effort I've put into this radio, it is far from worth it! I'll go back to a radio that uses batteries. Even though I must pay for the batteries, it won't fade on me for a month or more! If I were you, I wouldn't buy this product!"
2,Poor weather station reception,"I bought this radio for the emergency weather band. With frequent power outages and tornadoes here, such a radio is a household necessity. However, I can hardly get a signal for the closest weather station - I have to hold the radio at some ridiculous angle to get even a faint signal. By contrast I also have an Eton wind up radio I bought from LLBean for less money and I can get two weather stations crystal clear."
1,"Amazon is great.. phone is great, just say away from AT&T","WARNING: AT&T representatives (""Dawn: R361"" and ""Max: N360"") themselves said during my troubleshooting (as detailed below) that I should NOT have bought through Amazon, and that they have received a barrage of complaints from Amazon buyers! I still really like Amazon, but they're integration with AT&T is non existent. People should not have to wait 2-3 days for service after they receive the phone. Buy the same phone on Amazon, but a different carrier."
3,Worth a look,"CaveGirl is a humorous tongue in cheek romantic comedy that follows the romantic relationship of bumbling modern day Rex and beautiful sexy pre-historic cavegirl, Eba. The movie follows Rex through a series of slapstick pranks and mishaps that culminate in his transport 25,000 years back in time where he meets and falls in love with Eba. Along the way, Rex becomes a man, saves Eba and the rest of the clan. Will Rex return to his own time, where Eba cannot possible fit in? Or will he stay and build a life with Eba and the rest of the tribe.This movie is a humorous, and at times, a poignant, look at the trials, tribulations, and opportunities that young people often face as they come of age. Well worth a look."
5,"Awesome pants, fit well and durable","These are awesome pants. They fit well, lots of pockets and quality made: very durable."
5,Footnotes bring the footlights to your living room,"Ever watch a ballet and wonder what on earth is going on? Have you ever considered the thoughts that enter a dancers mind when they are on the stage? Do you want to know the story behind the story of the classic dances? Well, wonder no more!The Footnotes series of videos by Kultur are marvelous at explaining the basics of ballet to the novice while capturing the heart of the seasoned dancer as well. Frank Augustyn takes you on a journey into the very soul of ballet with his insightful, and sometimes humerous style. The interviews with the dancers are candid, the dance footage is inspiring, and the explainations of mechanics and technique will dispell more than a few myths.If you are a seasoned ballet goer, a dancer, or even a complete novice, this tape is for you!"
3,An Easy Read,I found this book to be a bit ordinary with not too much of a storyline but there is some good sex in it if that is what you are after.I would have liked more of a story line but if you want something quick and enjoyable to read this will fit the bill.
3,My mom loves George Burns,"Got this as a present for my mom, she loves the OH God series, as well as George Burns. The movies have a nice message, if in a little bit of a sappy format."
4,Really funny movie,I can recommend this movie. I have the first two movies as well and from the title I was not sure of this one. I like it a lot. Truly funny and yet still actually sending a valuable message.
2,Garden flag/Nebraska,It was advertised to come with a plastic stand. The only thing in the box was a flag--no stand. Really disappointing on game day!
4,Nebraska Flag worked great as gift,This was the perfect gift for a huge Nebraska fan. It can be hard to find gifts for a man but this was perfect for a dear friend. He takes pride in his lawn and couldn't wait to display his flag in his landscaped area. Nice bright colors in the flag.
3,Truck Bed Sidet Step,"I installed this on a 2009 Dodge Ram Mega Cab truck. Overall this is a helpful product... but installation was a little tricky and instructions were very vague. The step needs to be a little larger or needs to stick out further. On the Dodge the beam that you have to mount it to puts the step towards the cab to far.... it needs to be further back towards the rear of the truck to access your box. I have to get up on the step with one foot and then swing my other leg to the top of the tire to balance myself and also to get access to the box or anything in the bed of the truck. The idea for the product is great, but again the step is so small you can't balance yourself without swinging your other leg out to something for balance."
1,Truck side step by Bully,"If this step had fit, I would have given it 5 rating as it seems well made, but... I have a 2008 2500HD Sierra, and according to the information give, this step should fit - it definitely doesn't. I called the 800 number in the box, and after several calls back and forth, his only advice was to machine or grind down one of the the parts, and make a different spacer, and etc. Huh? Even if I did all that, the step wouldn't be secure, as the only cross member available for installation has less than 4"" free, and the step needs more than twice that to be stable. Amazon gladly accepted the return and as far as I am concerned, they get a 5+ rating for customer service."
4,Easy Install,I bought one for each side of my F-350 CC short box. Took less then an hour to install with a couple wrenches and a screw driver. They seem pretty sturdy. Haven't had to use them yet but sure look like they'll do the trick.
1,Does not fit 1996 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup,"Although this was supposed to fit that pickup, there was absolutely anyway to mount it using hardware provided or following instructions."
3,"Great product, but too far forward to help","On my 2012 Superduty the suggested mounting point is too far forward to be useful.While I will keep it as it is installed, suggest new customers look under their truck to see where the cross member is to determine if it will be useful."
1,not the best materials,Have had on my truck for about 4 years now and the corrosion is on every thing that is not aluminum. Pull handle is froze in place and broke today. Will try and disassemble tomorrow after soaking in Seafoam. Needs to be replaced but not sure if I can get a replacement handle or may just scrap whole thing.
2,Rusted shut,"While this product looks good and functions well while new, it rusted shut over the winter and is inoperable. What a piece of junk. I mounted it on my F150 and it seemed to be just the thing I needed. Unfortunatley, it didn't survive the winter in Minn. and in the spring when I tried to use it, is was no longer operable due to rusting solid in the closed position. You'd think that would have somehow been factored in to the product development given its location on the bed and exposure to water, snow, salt, etc. Shopping again for a different model."
1,eHats not good to deal with,"I've rated at 1 star for the company eHats. The product may be fine, but I wont order from this company again.I ordered the hat to be shipped to an APO address which they said they can ship to. 2 weeks after placing the order, I got a message saying the package was unclaimed, returned and I'd been given a refund minus shipping and restocking fee.When I contacted the company to see what happened, they said my address looked wierd and there must be something wrong with it. I've had dozens of packages from many suppliers deliver to me fine with the same address. This is the first time something hasn't reached me. They refused to accept that and said there was a problem with the address.Not only do I not have the hat, they've charged me shipping and restocking because they thought my address looked wierd!"
2,Wonderful attempt... accenting on the word attempt,"Mozart, an absolutely wonderful musician, tries his best to apply his past genius from works like ""The Magic Flute"" or even the incredibly popular piece, ""Ave Verum Corpus"" to the beautiful instrument most refer to as the piano. His ""best try"" falls short of all expectations as he slides in and out of outrageous themes, incomprehensible modulations, and terribly futile cadences. Perhaps he should spend more of this time learning to play this beautiful instrument than writing pointless music intended to damage such beautiful ivories."
5,New Int'l Webster's Dictionary,This new pocket edition is perfect for the student or teacher inyour house. It is up-to-date as to technical language and thebelles lettres diction for English literature. It has sporadicillustrations and definitions are set forth clearly and concisely.The price is reasonable for the standard household budget.
3,Tries too hard - overblown,"They really put EVERYTHING into this CD-set, and shouldn't have. The first CD is filled with great early Elvis, but most of the second CD is ""alternative-versions"" and really lousy-quality live recordings that only a collector would be interested in."
5,Rock and Roll's Big Bang,"RCA has finally organized and packaged Elvis' seminal work in a way that allows the most casual rock fan to understand what the fuss was about. By progressing from the studio on Disc 1 to the live recordings on Disc2, you understand how what seemed at first like a ""accident"",(the combining of r&b and country styles)evolved into the rock and roll music that exploded across the country.You are present at rock and roll's ""Big Bang"". The shock waves have been rolling ever since!"
5,An Unforgettable Novel,"I read The Forger by accident. Many years ago, as an udergraduate student, I was traveling by bus from Wilmington Delaware to Princeton, WV. I bought the book so I would have something to read. Once I started, I could not put it down. I loved the story, the narration, and how the novel was structured. Although I did not know it at the time, this book would also influence my writing career.If you have the chance, set some time aside and get into this novel; you will be glad you did."
5,A new voice,"The Interpreter is a psychological novel of stunning prose. The heroine is a 29 year old Korean woman who works as an interpreter in the court system. While the reader travels through her mind, overhearing her reflections on her murdered parents, her estranged sister and her many loves, the reader is also traveling into a dark terrain: the Korean underworld as it exists today in New York. Suki Kim's language is poetic: a stream of consciousness -- fearless and without sentiment -- that bores into the mind of the heroine. The Interpreter is a very impressive literary debut."
1,A poor imitation of Native Speaker,"The novel could have been somethign quite wonderful but as it is, it suffers from a far-fetched and rather implausible plot. Kim should have left out what sounds like Hollywood-inspired twists in Suzy's investigation of her parents's murder. The book left me dissatisfied and unmoved. It seems to me a poor imitation at best of Chang-rae Lee's Native Speaker."
1,"Goodness, no","This has been done before and much, much more deftly. Try Chang's Over the Shoulder or Lee's Native Speaker."
1,BAD advertising,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. Note that the item states ""LARGE print"". Well, this is a lie. There is no large print and this was a deception. If you are looking for a large print Bible then do not buy this because this company has lied. I will be returning this. Not worth the hassle."
3,Maze Fans...We Are One,"I am surprized...If you have the Maze Live in Philly, than you have this show. Nothin new. The preview suggested that there was ""new"" material (Look In Your Eyes & Working Together). I would love to see Frankie attempt a show dedicated to some of his love ballards from his library of wonderful hits. It was very interesting to see so many Europeans groovin with Frankie."
5,The Hymn For A Classic Album,"This CD is a collection of rare and unreleased hefner songs. The album starts off with two of the best hefner songs i've ever heard (Christian Girls & Lee Remick). I first heard Christian Girls on the rare 10inch Ep 'The Hefner Soul', which also includes 'The Hymn For The Coffee' also included on this album. The 'Christian Girls' included on this album is a new reworked version which was recentley released as a single. The album also includes 'Twisting Mary's Arm' which the band finish all their shows with, and said they would never recored."
3,Buy used,"Some decent songs, but nothing that compelling- the album as a whole has a consistent vision that elevates it, but not to 4 star status."
4,More about the people than the money.,"I found this very watchable, although if you're expecting action and wild parties, get something else. It was very real, and interesting to see that people remain true to their characters despite winning millions of dollars. One group of shared winners all worked in a school cafeteria and nearly all kept their jobs. Another compulsive gambler squandered his millions. I found by the end that it was an understated commentary on what's important in life, because the money couldn't really help unless the important things were already present."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I hadn't purchased it. It was awful! totally boring. It showed the lives of 3 previous winners and how they live now (20 years later). It actually had nothing to do with what they did with the money or any of the stuff you THINK this DVD should be about. The stories were slow moving with turtle like music (yeah) to go with it. When you buy these type of documentaries, you expect to hear ""What happened to my life after winning, what I did, bought, how my family reacts, this is my home. But I don't know what the producer of this garbage was thinking, I really don't. This views like a documentary from the lives of older people in their retirement. Their stories could have been told by anyone! yuk. Its now at my local video rental store, I wish I would have waited!"
2,Christmas Carousel Stocking Kit,"I have purchased many of these felt stocking kits in the past and have been very pleased. However, I was very disappointed with this purchase. This kit did not come complete. There were no sequins, beads, thread or needles."
5,Great instruction,This book is a wonderful beginning instruction on pen and ink drawing. It gives you examples of things to practice to learn and perfect your new skills.
3,Not for the beginner,The book is an overview to techniques in pencil and ink sketching. It is not a beginners book. There is little structure with topics moving from moderate to easy to hard. Very disappointed with the misleading title.
3,Getting settled in Nicocemus,"The all Colored town has finally gotten started. The adjacent all white town has a compassionate doctor, whose daughter has traveled away to school. She becomes ill with a mysterious illness which takes up a good portion of the book. Back home in Hill City, Truth and Moses are still in love, but is something wrong? Poor Jarena....is her betrothed really dead? Will she never marry? Of course the arrival of a wicked aunt has the Harban family in an uproar. What disturbance will she bring? Her revelations are at the heart of this book, and I am sure will play a major role in book three. Thank you Judith Miller"
5,Great little egg masher,Cute design fits the hand perfectly because of its small size and does a good job of mashing. Also good for mashing potatoes and other items.
1,Paint fainted,"I used this to mash eggs for my 9-month old son, it is very use-efficiency at beginning, about one month later, the orange paint in the bottom getting off."
2,I Should Have Rented It,"This is one of those movies to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do. It's very slow, very predictable, etc., etc., just like most other so-called horror flicks. Waiting on Hollywood to release a worthwhile movie of any kind is like waiting on the next pass of Haley's Comet..., this is especially true with horror movies. The last time I saw a good horror movie was ""The Descent."" Now THAT was a horror movie!! It was so original..., so very unique., so well casted & directed, etc., etc. It's already a classic. Why can't Hollywood make more movies like that?? So, while we wait on another ""The Descent"" to be made, I guess we have to suffer with B-level stuff like ""The Echo."""
3,"BOBBY, I NEED YOU","Bobby (Jesse Bradford) is out on parole for manslaughter. He is on his best behavior as he tries to get his life together. He starts to see his ex-girlfriend (Amelia Warner) on a friend basis. He has moved into the apartment that his mother lived and died in. The other tenets are not receptive to him. Bobby is haunted by dreams of his dead mother and hears strange noises no one else hears except for Joseph (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who, like the rest of the tenets, seems a bit off.The movie finally escalates when he intervenes in a domestic issue that takes place in the adjacent apartment. The film has a haunting ""Juon"" quality about it. My biggest complaint is that the build-up is too slow. I got bored waiting for this film to take off. Jesse Bradford plays a rather lame Bobby.F-bomb, No sex, or nudity. Violence to women."
2,It could of been alot better,"The movie, which was only 1:31 minutes long, for the first hour, you didn't know what the hell was going on, it was only in the last fifteen minutes that you were given the clues to figure it out and bam! then it was over. It could of been alot better. The directer was filming like he was on a strict budget. Another one that will be on TV soon."
1,Is it over yet?,"Wow. All I can say is that this was possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is very slow, and if you ask me, it's not even scary. 30 minutes into the movie, I just kept asking when the movie would be over because it was so bad. It never got better either. I hope everybody will take my advice and save their money for something more important than for a piece of junk movie like this, or if you really want to see it, rent it first because I am almost positive you TRUE horror movie fans won't like it. Whoever rated this movie 5 stars must not know what a good horror movie is. If I had the option to rate this movie a 0, I would do it without thinking twice. I ask everybody again to save their money for something more worth their time."
2,THE ECHO IS NOT SO RESONANT,"I think American remakes of Asian horror movies more often than not are ineffective. THE ECHO is another example. While I haven't seen the original, THE ECHO doesn't inspire me to do so.The movie's basic premise is revenge and the consequences of non-responsiveness to people in peril. This is confusing because some of the victims don't truly deserve to be punished. THE ECHO is also very slow in its pacing and I've grown weary of all Asian remakes having little girl spooks. Jesse Bradford's performance has its moments but eventually fizzles. Amelia Warner is effective as Bradford's supportive girl friend and Kevin Durand is chilling as the abusive cop who abuses his wife and daughter.THE ECHO is to be commended for its atmospheric setting and its moral message, muddled though it is. Its abrupt ending is also a drawback. Ultimately, it's an average entry in a tired genre."
1,Boring,"I didn't like the book, I wish I had bought a different book but this book was totally boring for me. I don't know why I wanted it, I guess I expected more for my money."
5,I LOVE THIS SONG!!!! O:),I knew i loved this song from the first time i heard it. This song brings back so many memories of love and i get teary eyed everytime i hear it....i still love the song though.... o:) Rox
4,Monica has a great voice that fits this song,"Im from England and I bought the original by Eternal, Monica's cover version is not that bad , but I still prefer the original."
5,Monica Does It Again!!,"The song ""Angel of Mine"" is absolutely beautiful. The words express how two people feel when they are in love. This is my song with my boyfriend."
5,her superlative vioce stads on its own beside the lyrics!!,Her voice instead of flowing with the song is singled out to me along with the lyrics. No one else could sing the song with a soothing power that is brought out through Monicas' voice.Gina L.
4,a wonderful beatuiful song.,GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR SONG.
1,Not too hot,"When I first heard ""Angel Of Mine"" by Eternal a couple of years ago, I didn't really like the song, and Monica's voice only makes it sound weird. The guitars are really annoying, too. As for ""The First Night"" remix, it's not so good, not even HALF as good as the original, which wasn't all that great in the first place! P.S. No offense to Monica or Monica fans, I think she has a realy good voice, it just doesn't work on this track."
3,Eternal's version is MUCH better...,"I just think that Eternal's version of ""Angel of Mine"", the version which was released FIRST, is better than Monica's version. It's not that Monica's version isn't good; it's just that Eternal's version is better..."
3,great product to have on hand-- updated april 2011,"I frequently forget to charge my other phone headsets and have to rely on more ""old-fashioned"" methods of hands-free communication. This headset works great with my cell and with my land line phone. The cushion over the earpiece means I don't get a sore ear like I do with either of my bluetooth head sets. I need to have a phone connected to my head most of the day, so comfort and sound quality are important. This is the second unit I've ordered (the last one got caught in my car door and is still working, but with lots of duct tape....)Update:This second one just quit on me. Once again it caught in something and the cord ripped out of the jack. Unlike the car incident, this was just snagged on the dishwasher and I didn't pull very hard before it ripped apart. They need to beef-up the connection from wire to jack. I need another headset and won't be buying another one of these."
5,south park mexican does it once again!!!,"south park mexican aka spm comes out with another tight album with his hit single ""you know my name"". i think this album tops all of his albums cause he's got a little something for everyone and the beats and lyrics are off the chain. the only disappoinment is there are only 7 tracks that spm raps on, the rest are just other rappers,under his label dopehouse records. spm is worldwide now, with his distribution deal with unversal records so he's gonna blow up big time. spm's gonna drop another new album later this year called ""time is money"" so look for that one."
5,SPM Rules,"South Park Mexican's the Purity album is the best yet! It has lots of great songs, and cool beats. If your not buyin this cd, you better, cause the cd is great. Also you might want to buy this album now because people like me are gonna buy them all! Peace out!!!!"
4,"good, but...","the moves are fun. choreography well done. but, i was expecting and desiring more instruction. i found this dvd to be more entertaining than helpful in learning. the insider view of getting ready for competition and stuff was interesting, and they definitely plugged themselves as choreographers, but, if you are looking to actually learn the routines, be ready for a lot of work analyzing, rewinding, etc. but, if you are a quick study and you can see a move and duplicate it easily - you'll love the unique and energized routines."
1,Didn't get to play it,I didn't even put the DVD in to play it. When it arrived it was scratched ALL over! There was no way I was going to keep it so I ended up returning it. Perhaps other purchasers will have better luck but I'd suggest just making up your own routines.
1,Buyer Beware,"Same problems others have noted, first the most used right side died, now the left. Total working time about 3 years of light home use. Not what you would expect for $100. Called a KitchenAid authorized repair shop but parts are not really available. Will replace with one that does not have a fancy circuit board, just a plain old toaster."
1,Sad that I wasted $100+ too :(,"Come on Kitchen Aid... really? Their stand mixers and other items seem durable, so we forked out over $100 for this toaster... which just stopped working on the right side (the same complaint other reviewers said - it just won't go down/work) ... and yes, it's been a little over a year, so no warranty. I accidentally pulled out my Cuisinart manual (for our old 2-slice toaster) and was reading there was a 3-year warranty and was hopeful... until I realized I was looking at the wrong toaster information ... and see that Kitchen Aid is ridiculous and only offers one year. : So I guess we'll be using the old Cuisinart until we find another 4-slice toaster... really really ridiculous, and verrrrrry disappointing Kitchen Aid!!! :("
2,"Nice, but short-lived","This seemed to be a good toaster, for a while. At exactly two years old, the left side would not latch down. One thing you don't have to worry about is KitchenAid support -- there isn't any! They don't answer e-mails. Buy at your own risk."
1,Returning,"Takes too long to toast. Everything dries out. Did not toast that evenlyKitchenAid KMTT400OB 4-Slice Metal Toaster, Onyx Black and Stainless Steel"
5,BEST DEAL FOR BEST TOASTER ON THE MARKET!!!!!,"And rightfully so! At only $55,559.99, this toaster is a steal!!!!! It even takes your soft bread and makes it dry, brown, and crispy!!! JUST LIKE TOAST!!!! Oh, but it's not toast. For $55,000+, you get so much more than toast! YOU GET KITCHENAID KMTT400OB 4-SLICE MEATAL TOASTER TOAST!!!!! Crunch....Crunch....ENJOY!!!!!....Crunch.....Crunch......Crunch..........Uhhh...........I think my toast is burned.....Crunch.....Crunch........MEH.....Oh well.....Crunch..........Crunch..........CRUNCH!!!!!!!!!"
3,Toaster lasted < 1 year! - Slow customer service.,"I have bought 2 of these in the past 2 years, the first one lasted about 10 months and then one lever would no longer push down for some reason, so we couldn't use that side. So, I figured it was a fluke and bought another. The second one lasted just over a year and did the same thing. I contacted Kitchen Aid to see if they could do anything as I had read on the Kitchen Aid site that it has a one year warranty. I received no reply at all!*****UPDATE**************Kitchen Aid did contact me by phone about 3 weeks after I sent the email. They sent a new toaster right away! I'll give it another chance. In my opinion, customer service is just as important as selling a quality product, but you must have both to succeed!"
3,good toaster but too big,It's a fine toaster but I'm not wowed by it. I would keep it except it's too big and takes up too much space in my small kitchen. I'm going to return it.
3,Good Toaster UPDATE,"UPDATE: One year later, if I had it to do over again, I would not buy this toaster. It works OK, but it is nothing special. Toasting isn't even, and it takes sooooo long, even on the lighter settings. Just not worth the premium price. And this toaster has the most difficult stainless steel of our refrig, toaster oven, microwave, and coffee maker.This is a nice toaster, but my buyer's remorse is setting in. It is very large (perhaps because it is well insulated and stays cool to the touch), so be prepared to make room for it. If you like to cover your appliances, realize that the selections are more limited at this size.The performance is no better than a previous midrange-priced unit we had, and I agree with some reviewers that it seems to dry out the item being toasted. Our previous toaster claimed some kind of a moisture sensor.I am not a big fan of stainless, and these surfaces are pretty demanding.Overall, a cheaper unit would probably have worked just as well."
5,Toaster,"KitchenAid KMTT400SS 4-Slice Metal Toaster, Brushed Stainless SteelExcellent performance. Toasts evenly on all sides of 1,2 3,or 4 slices. Can select to toast one side more that the other. Easy to clean, looks good on the counter, easy to read controls. Would buy another if needed."
1,Parts Availability,"This is a very nice toaster. However, one of the two plastic knobs that are used to lower the toast broke in half. Searching to buy a new knob, the price varies from $33.02 ea. plus frt. down to $24.70 plus frt. OUCH....I can buy the new toaster for $80....Not a good investment..Not recommended.."
3,Not very custom,"Arrived with no instructions, just rolled up in a box with two pieces of stick on velcro attached to one end of it. Did not really fit my 2006 Jeep Liberty. Will take some manipulating to make it fit properly. It either blocks the left or right side window defroster vent as well. I am not sure if I will be able to make it fit, or if I should send it back."
5,Suspense in an exotic setting!,"Anne Maybury's ""The Midnight Dancers"" is a romantic suspense story that takes place in the exotic lushness of Bou Hammagan, North Africa. From England, Catherine comes to Bou Hammagan to join her step daughter and husband who is on location for a job. The sweltering heat and colorful scenery is intoxicating as Catherine dwells in the strangeness of this foreign city. But aside from this beauty, there hides a darkness that is evil. After recieving a mysterious box, which contains a note which says ""...Brightness falls from the air, Queens have died young and fair, Dust hath closed dark Catherine's eye..."", she realizes that someone is out to do harm to her...or is it to her family? This novel was a delight to read. I can almost see the exotic beauty of Bou Hammagan. The suspense was great. I recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense and a little romance too!"
4,The third best RPG,Sudeki is going to rock but with the late release date there may be a problem with True Fantasy Live Online and FABLE. True Fantasy is going to be a kick a$$ MMORPG and FABLE is going to be the best of all.
2,Avoid pre-ordering this,"Usually when a game relies on sex appeal (females with big breasts in skimpy outfits), it ends up being a poor game. Even at the E3 convention, it relied on models in skimpy clothing to grab the attention of the dominant gamer population (males). Why not use the graphics and gameplay for that? (Note: I'm a straight male.)All in all, I am not saying that this will be a bad game (it actually looks descent in the previews), just avoid pre-ordering it until valid reviews appear."
1,Sudeki facts,"Some Sudeki facts (taken from various reliable sources):-Will attempt to be an RPG like Zelda or Final Fantasy (feature very similar controls to those in Zelda)-The player can choose between 4 characters (4 Players cannot all play at once)-For X-Box only (not for PS2, PSP, PC, GameCube or any handhelds)-No online compatibility"
1,another delay,First Amazon states 13th the game will become available. Now Amazon states 20th the game will become available. Whats the betting the date will be pushed back again and again and again?Amazon should only list products that are available now. The amount of times I pre order an item only to receive email after email telling me I can't have what I ordered.(...)
3,what type of game is Sudeki?,"From what there has been shown of Sudeki on the web it sure looks colorful at times and dark at other times. I have no idea what Sudeki is about although it reminds me of Shenmui set in ancient times. Not being an expert on art i've read Sudeki is supposed to be Japanese in it's theme. It does not strike me as all that Japanese. The 4 main characters look cartoon like if anything. Is it a fighting game? The four character idea, is it like Gauntlet where you choose to be one of four characters each with their own unique powers?"
2,weak story and poor characters,"After reading the Sudeki reviews on Amazon and seeing many 4 to 5 star ratings it persuaded me to obtain a copy. After playing Sudeki I was left thinking just one thought, those Amazon reviews must have been writen Microsoft themselves, no way is Sudeki a 4 to 5 star game. it's a 2 to 3 star game. Reviews a side here some Sudeki facts:The graphics in Sudeki look good. The movement of the graphics is not so smooth. The sound in Sudeki is ok. The sound in Sudeki is ill fitting, it does not add any atmosphere. The story is weak. The combat system is ill implemented and frustrating to use, it drove me nuts. The voice acting has to be heard to be belived. The voices used in Sudeki are a joke, its almost comical at times. At least thet made me laugh alittle. Sudeki is a nice idea that as far too many short comings."
3,"Huge potential, modest effort.","Graphics 8/10 - Easy on the eyes, character models are well animated, object shadows are nice. The static scenery is passable. Spells are quite pretty.Sound 8/10 - good voice work, weapon sounds are great, solid but not special soundtrack, enemy sounds are quality bears.Gameplay 7/10 - Two characters play in a PSO-esq fashion, the other two play in FPS style. The path you travel is linear, there is zero exploration. The party system is implemented well though, and the ""quickshot"" item feature is handy.Overall 23/30 C+ - considering that there's a severe lack of RPGs for the ecksbox Sudeki serves as a nice distraction until the likes of Fabel, Jade Empire and KotOR II arrive. Even a casual gamer should be able to finish this in under 20 hours. Likeable, but ultimately forgetable."
2,Fairly Disappointing,"I was excited to finally see a RPG on Xbox that was able to get my attention. I have always been a fan of the Final Fantasy series and looked forward to getting my hands on an RPG that had the graphics capabilities of the Xbox. I was quickly impressed by the looks of Sudeki, smooth textures, great colors, very nice. I was just as quickly disappointed by the rest of the game. The voices are terrible, and the music is even worse. I play most of the game without the volume up. The absolute worst feature of the game, though, is it's simplicity. As I said, I'm a Final Fantasy fan, long games with quests that are at least challenging. This game lacks both of those features. It is extremely short for an RPG and there is no such thing as a challenging quest. Also, they max out your experience at level 30, there is a pretty short list of special skills that you can learn, and a very small assortment of weapons. This is probably a good RPG to start a 10 year old off with..."
5,Something great,Since i bought the game i have been impresed with the graphics and gameplay like never before the game is simply awesome and i recomend it to everyone
2,dissapointed,"after playing fable, i thought i would try another rpg. this game was a dissapointment. the story line isnt as interesting and the gameplay didnt feel right. i was bored after an hour of playing."
3,SOME INFO.,"{in answer to Terry from WDC} from what i can gather Sudeki is a third person shooter without the shooting as the 4 main player controlled characters are armed with swords and magic powers. One of the characters looks like he has a rocket attached to his back. Maybe it can be fired?. As for the story line, no idea, cannot help you there.The 3 star score is for looks as i have not played the game as it is not avaliable at this moment in time."
1,"Bad, bad, bad, BAD","I like RPG's they are my favorite genre of games so when I saw this at my local videostore I decided to try it. THANK GOD I rented it and didnt buy it or I would be really mad that I blew $50 (at the time) to buy this peice of crap. The voice overs are terrible and the storyline is odd and whats with the whole switching to first person mode on the sorceress and the scientist characters thats soooo dumb. Im not going to go on complaining any more but just know that if you are looking for a good RPG you may want to try these:1. Fabe (XB)2. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicals (GC)3. Any PS2 final fantasy game4. Xmen Legends (XB, PS2, GC?)5. Harvest moon (GC, Sims + Old Mcdonald)Try those instead there much better than this"
4,SudekiRoboto,"Sudeki looks like a really cool game! I'm into the extended game and Japanese art concepts, so this game seem in my league. I think I will by this game first, before all the others."
1,This game sucks,I rented Sudeki expecting something like KOTOR meets the realtime fighting style of Baulders gate. But instead this game sucks when you play as Allish or Ellco it becomes a first person shooter which is so dum because you cant see if some one is attacking you from the side and its hard not to get hit.Then if you play as Buki or Tal the combos are a little limited and very slow. Also Allish's voice is SOOOOO ANNOYING OMG I WANT TO STRANGLE HER WHEN SHE TALKS!! This game sucks and if you want a good RPG to tide you over until Fable comes out try Samari Warriors. DO NOT GET THIS GAME you'll be sorry.
1,At best mediocre. And thats being very very generous.,"Let me first explain there were good elements in this game. The graphics, espescially those of the environment were great. I also do like where the combat system went. Firstly the voice acting. It's horrible. Thats about it on that...its just horrible. The music was most likely bad. Or at least forgettable as I can't remember there being music. Mayve some techno sounds in the background I guess. Then the story. The story is a rushed peice of crap not fit for a shallow action game involving half-vampire unicorn babies. Or something equally stupid. Not to mention it jumps along from learning of the great evil you must face to facing it five minutes later in one of the many crummy single person boss fights. All of which have an easily discernable pattern. Boring and not very creative. Just like the rest of the game. Save you money and wait for fable."
3,Sudeki is an RPG with Combat,"See the box art, 4 characters all armed with a different weapon. The female at the front has what appears to be ken style fire balls, the female on the left side has a twin prong device, the male to the right a sword and the male towards the back has what looks like a large hand gun. Sure looks like a whole lot of fighting and killing will take place. Sudeki is supposed to be an rpg, quite what the balance is between combat and puzzle solving has not been disclosed on any of the web sites to my knowledge."
3,"castles, red dragons - what next?",there have been many images posted around of the castle - none showing a red dragon though. they have done a good job of keeping that well hidden3 stars for Sudeki - my copy has yet to arrive. only then can a proper review be written
3,Not for everyone!,"You've probably already read enough about this game to decide if it is for you or not- but just in case...First off, Sudeki is easy- very, very easy. And it's quick too- I finished it in just nine hours. Yes, I did play it though in one go, but only because I constantly believed it would get better, which it never did.While the game is pretty, with a fair enough musical score and compentant voice acting on the part of the four priciple characters, it fails to make use of the athmosphere. If you were expecting the high drama of a Final Fantasy, you're going to be dissipointed. Even if your standards are lower, this game still leaves a lot to be desired.The gameplay is solid, but just not fleshed out enough. If you're new to Japanese style RPGs you might want to try this one. If you just need to kill a few hours, wait until the price comes down into the sub-20 range. Other than that- leave this one on the shelves."
3,"Decent Printer/Fax, Terrible Scanner","I've had this machine for more than a year and use it as a backup for my laser printer, as well as for occasional faxing and scanning. It's fine for printing and faxing, but the scanner is so poorly designed--it's amazing. I teach technology skills for a living, and I find the scan function absolutely baffling to use. So counterintuitive, I suspect that the engineers are somehow playing a joke on Canon and the company has not noticed yet.Best example: You want to scan multiple pages into one document so you can email the document. Common use, right? With this machine, you need to make a bunch of adjustments to the default settings and then, if you need to use the sheet-feeder (instead of the platen glass, which only suppots letter-size), the function doesn't work at all. Highly irritating. I could have physically walked all of my documents across the city by the time I finished hand-feeding all my double-sided legal documents into the machine. Aargh."
2,It's great until you experience problems,"Purchased this unit March 2004. Unit was defective out of the box and was promptly replaced by Canon's Instant Exchange Program. Worked fine until June 1 and was told that I would get a replacement ""print head"" despite the fact that I've pointed out that I wanted a replacement unit since this is available as an option. The part is on it's way and should be arriving here on June 7. As promised by one of Canon's Tech Support supervisor, if this doesn't work they will be shipping me another unit. I know Canon makes great products and the reviews here made me decide to purchase this MF. It's a great product when it works. But my experience going through 2 defective units makes me wonder about the workmanship of this product. BTW Canon Support is one of the best in the industry. This is the only reason why I would end up keeping the product rather than donating it to charity. I eventually got a replacement unit and so far have not had any more problems."
5,I didn't know it was possible to love a printer this much!,"This is an awesome printer. Quiet, fast, great quality, easy to install. You will not regret spending the extra money - they quality is worth it!"
2,USB problems,"I, like several others, have had problems with this machine recognizing the printer. It seems that the MP730 has a conflict with the USB port for several people, including myself. I called Canon and they gave me the runaround about how this wasn't an issue. Well, do a Google search and you will find this actually is a known problem. After following the installation instructions, to an exact T several times with different USB cables, it still would not recognize the printer. My story is not the only one like this. Other reviewers problems with this KNOWN problem read identical to mine. If you are one of the lucky ones to have no USB problems, then you have a great multi-functional machine. I wish I was so lucky!"
2,Erroe & Alarm Issues,"I have had my MP730 for 4 days now and so far have talked with Canon tech once. When we try to print from our computers we keep getting an error 5C00 and the alram goes off. Tech said to turn off, on again, reset the print head and cartridges. It should not keep happening!!! I have to do a few more things: get a different USB cable to see if that's the issue, see if Canon will send me a new print head, try a different network cable (no info on network issues in the manual). I went to a Canon product because I have had issues with HP all in ones. Now I am not sure there are any good one's out there!"
2,color was off,"I orderd this for my daughter and she thought it was an offwhite color. When it came it was periwinkle and with a color called ""helio"" we didnt know! I have returned it and continue to wait for a black one on backorder..."
1,over rated material,Mr Reynolds provides basic information in an overrated book. You can get Incoterm info from web sites for free - save your $43 for something more worthwhile
5,A gem,"One of the best albums of the year. When I bought it I didn't expect to like it this much. I could tell from the song titles that it was just more rehashed samples from Gen's old spoken word pieces put to some kind of backing tracks, like that ""collaboration"" with Merzbow.While that may be technically true, what we have here are trip-hop beats, spacey synth & theremin, and dubby electronica with Gen's manipulated voice. This is a seriously cool album. Perfect for getting stoned, having sex or just chilling out after a night on the town. It doesn't break any new musical ground, but it's a truly enjoyable ride...and that's a compliment for any album."
5,CCCP Red Army Shirt,"The shirt is what it is explained to be, the sizing was perfect and it was sent on time and got to my home early"
4,Big ups to di Fireman,"This is great and all, but if you buy this, you are doing yourself a dissservice. To be perfectly honest, any wise man know that Di Fireman is the best, so might as well buy his whole record collection, and not just his greatest hits. jah bless"
4,Capleton is one the best dancehall kings!,I am a big reggae dancehall fan this is cd is one of his best. I recommend this to anyone who love dancehall reggae.
4,Good documentary,"This DVD fulfilled exactly what I was looking for. I wanted some great shots of these monuments so I could decide for myself whether they were natural formations or not. I still cant decide but they do offer some great shots and multiple angles for some of the ""sculptures"" for you to make your own judgment. The brilliance of Dr Robert Schoch is also featured in this video so you know your going to get a good educated, critical analysis of the site. If you are interested in Markawasi get this DVD, in fact I really don't know of any other documentaries that cover this site but I think more needs to be done on it."
5,"The evidence is undeniable, excellent job!","An excellent video for people with an interest in ancient contact between Africa and South America. The conclusions reached are startling, and the evidence is undeniable.Giving credence to this theory is a recent scientific study from Svetlana Balabanova Germany that concluded a residue of coca (only grown in South America) was recently found in samples taken from a 4,000 year old Egyptian mummy raising the possibility that ancient Egyptians had contact with South America. If true, ancient Egyptians were trade partners with those cultures living in Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru. This film sheds new light on the growing controversy; view it with an open mind and the possibility that our history is much more extraordinary than currently taught.Stunning visuals and thought provoking interviews. It stirs the soul.Excellent job!"
1,This book it's too expensive,"I think that a book that's from a country where the minimun salary is less than US$1,000.00 A YEAR, should not be sale at US$195. The autor should not allow that."
2,Too academic,This book dissapointed me in so far as I thought it was too academically written. It failed to capture my imagination.
4,"Where there's a will, there's a way","This book is a compilation (accounts and stories, some related in great detail) of the ordeals of survivors of shipwrecks, plane crashes, exploring expeditions, etc. The accounts are fascinating (who couldn't find survival stories like these fascinating: just wondering how each of us would fare in similar circumstances is compelling enough). That's not to say that they don't become somewhat repetitive after a while, which they do. Seagrave has a main hypothesis he tries to prove along with the intriguing stories: those who survived had the will to survive, and special knowledge might help, but plays second fiddle to the will. Interesting."
4,Great Content Packaged in Frustrating Format,"Leslie functions through a method of story telling where he gives away his powerful punch-line, each time, right up front. This becomes wearisome by dissolving reader anticipation; however, the strength of his content does begin to overshadow this shortcoming. ""Risk and Recreation: A Chronology"" is undoubtedly the strongest aspect and worth the read entirely. A good composite of interesting survival stories."
4,Good Bedside Reading,"I quite enjoyed ""Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls"". Leslie obviously did extensive research on his subject, and his thoroughness pays off. Many of the stories are at least vaguely familiar to most, like the real Robinson Crusoe named Alexander Selkirk, and a host of others who shipwrecked, crashed, exiled or simply became lost. Amongst my favorites was the story of Hugh Glass who was vicously mauled by a Grizzly on the American Plains in 1823 and left to die by members of his expedition. Facing incredible odds, not only of surviving the wounds, but also battling starvation, the elements and furocious Indians over huge expenses of land and time to face again those who abandoned him.The only minor criticism I have is that it tends to be too thorough,and after a few dozen early shipwreck stories you feel relieved when a modern airplane crash changes the pace. All in all, a well written and interesting book."
5,Wow!,"This was a fascinating book. It contains many true stories of survival. If you liked the books Alive or The Perfect Storm, you will love this."
2,The Sound Effect Creator Didn't Like Parents,"Jack and Jill is beautifully illustrated with the main characters being cats. That's not my problem with the book.The problem is that the sounds to play (about 6) that come with this book are in one word: obnoxious. More words? Ok, they're tinny, loud, and extremely annoying.As the mother of a 16 month old, we have many toys that make noises and none sound like this. These noise-making toys are geared towards children so they're not to my taste, but some are even enjoyable to listen to. Not so Jack & Jill's sounds to play.I would give this book one star, but I have to admit my daughter likes the book with the sounds. No, she loves it. Fortunately, a mother's love comes with no strings attached."
2,not what it seemed,While it did arrive in very good condition when played the songs are what they say they are on the cover but...the computer signature lists a whole different album. And I have yet to figure out where the karaoke part is...no sign of any graphics or lyric lines that my computer can find.
1,Not Funny Enough,"This book is supposed to be funny; however, it isn't funny enough to justify its price. The book uses word phrases and plays on words to try and attempt its humor. It fails in every respect. Dont' get me wrong, there are a FEW funny parts to the book, but it simply repeats the same joke (using new words) over and over. Thus, it isn't funny enough. Don't buy it."
1,Feel Like Sandpaper,"I got these sheets for $35 but was really disappointed anyway. I washed them and placed them on the bed. The sheets are light weight, unlike for example ""The Grand"" sheets that I purchased through amazon, and they are really rough. The bag I receive came with a zipper and indicate that the sheets are made in China, for what its worth."
3,"Just ""Okay""","I ordered the queen size in the ""Pearl White."" They are very pretty sheets and a true bright white. However, I have two complaints: they are not as soft as I am used to and they do not fit well over my mattress. To be fair, I have a feather bed over my mattress, but have never had a problem with sheets fitting before. In fact, I even have a different set of Pinzon sheets and they fit wonderfully (the 200 gram flannel). So, these sheets aren't awful, but definitely not the best either."
3,Too Small,"The fitted sheet is too small for my mattress. I had already washed the sheets before putting them on my bed, so I could not return them. If you don't need deep pocket sheets then the sheets are very nice for the price."
2,"Scratchy, not sateen at all.","I've purchased sateen sheets of 400+ thread count before and all were softer than the set I just purchased. These were rougher than even my cheap percale 200 thread count sheets. I purchased them in hopes of providing soft, luxury sheets for house guests and instead, I was embarrassed to use them, opting for my older but softer sheets. The stars are for the dark platinum color and herringbone, which is pretty.But wow, everything from the fitted sheet to the pillow cases is rough like sandpaper."
4,Nice set of sheets for the money!,"I really liked these sheets. I was looking for a set to match my microfiber comforter. The color was true. I have been using them for about a month, each time I wash them they seem to get a little softer. I think they will hold up nicely."
4,Not for Winter,"Don't misunderstand, these sheets are great and the pockets on the fitted sheet are deep but they are pretty cold when you first crawl into bed, should be terrific in the summer time."
2,"Soft to sleep on, but scratchy on the face","The sheets were soft with the higher thread count, but the pattern made the pillow cases scratchy on our faces, even after washing. I would not buy them again."
2,"Soft, but pilled badly","They were beautiful out of the package, and comfortable after the first washing, but by the second, they began to pill. It's tolerable, but not what I would have expected from the thread count."
4,Nice sheets---great value,"Given the mixed reviews, I was pleasantly surprised on the softness and comfort of the sheets. They washed up well and after several washing I have not experienced any pilling."
4,Good quality,"I recently bought the white herring bone set in full size as a wedding gift and for the price I was surprised by the quality. The pattern was very nice, much better than the picture and the sheets were soft. I am told they also wash up nice."
3,Not as soft as expected,"On the positive side, these sheets have deep pockets and fit our pillow-top cal-king nicely. On the negative, we are always on the search for soft comfortable sheets. The 440-count cotton 'sateen' description sounded enticing. These are not uncomfortable by any means, but the soft factor wasn't there."
1,Like sleeping in a burlap bag,"I had success ordering Pinzon sheets from Amazon in the past and was in the market for a new sheet set. I found these sheets and thought, because of the product description, that they would be like the other sheets I previously ordered. I was wrong. These sheets feel like you are sleeping in a burlap bag. They are awful! Unfortunately with sheets, you really don't know until they are washed and on your bed, how you will like them. I would advise anyone looking for sheets to stay away from this set unless you want your body exfoliated while you sleep."
1,Lightweight,"This publication proved to be 'lightweight' in it's detail.It was extensively padded with blank, or half filled pages, written with double spacing.Also a lot of the book was just many pages listing the actual codes, (available on web) rather than detail about how to interpret the codes if ever encounteredit also disappointed me by it's inclusion of food recipies by the authors wife. Hardly the sort of detail relating to OBD automotive info.I sense that, as with other technical authors, he is reluctant to disclose any REAL MEANINGFUL INFORMATION. He did not, in my opinion, disclose anything meaningful by way of 'trade secrets, or really useful tips'.i suppose it is to be expected. Keep all the good stuff to ones self!The book looks good. Nice fonts, good color, attractive binding, etc, but it disappointed me greatly."
1,Most WORTHLESS book I've ever seen!,"This book is absolutely USELESS. It contains very little information--only brief and superficial explanations. Half the book is filled with lists of diagnostic codes easily available from the web. The lists of generic, GM specific and Chrysler specific codes only contain titles and do NOT contain explanations. The Ford codes have very brief explanations. To top it all off, there is an entire chapter of KITCHEN RECIPES! Yes, kitchen recipes in an OBD book! I could not believe my eyes. No words can adequately explain how bad this book is. Don't waste your money."
5,Great book,"This is great book, well written.I am a mechanic teacher, and I use this book to learn great diagnostic secret myself.many thanks"
1,Poor,"This book is only good for a reference guide for Ford andGM trouble codes. The book doesn't help any one who is tryingto repair a really troublesome problem;in fact, it doesn'thelp in trouble shooting simple problems. Problems that couldbe fixed by simply turning the gas cap an extra turn or two.I only blame my self for wasting my hard earned money. Pleasetake my advice and don't be fooled by the books good reviews,wich are odviously writen by people who are not professionaltechnicians."
3,Not what I expected,I thought from reading the sample pages that this book would explain codes and a brief explanation as to what to check for each code. It was more of an overview of ODBII with some details I could use.
3,I expected more.,I am a hobbyist/shad tree mechanic. The history was nice but not necessary for me. I was looking for a lot more than a huge trouble chart. More about how each sensor work. More about how to interpret the code reader. More about what sensor readings are going to be call bad by the ECM. And less about cooking meals.
2,I expected more from a 'Bible',"Purporting to be the ""OBD II Bible"", I find that this book falls short of the mark. Although I did learn a few things from the book, I expected considerably more technical content. I was able to read through most of the book in an evening (except for the recipe chapter, which I was somewhat annoyed to find- feeling that if I wanted a recipe book, I would have *bought* a recipe book!).I will say that the book does present clear, concise and well laid out text and graphics for the content it does have. But I was expecting a far more in-depth treatise on the subject going into possible symptoms/solutions for each type of main OBD II code.In the author's defense, I probably am not the target audience as I am a computer engineer who's playing around with designing an OBD II scan tool as a hobby."
5,Excellent Replacement,"the battery that came with the phone lasted since 2005 to about three months ago, so i guess that's pretty good. this one is just as the original so I'm expecting good performance over the years. For now all i can say is that last 4 days without charging with moderate use so i think is fair. Completely satisfied."
3,Awkwardly Useful,"The reader needs to remember this book has been translated and basically written by the creator of ""Laughing Yoga"". He wants to share his enthusiasm for this activity and encourage the reader to invest in the practice. That said, it is an awkward read and does not offer someone looking for scientific evidence to support the benefits, much to go on. It is full of the authors personal experiences and these become repetitively cumbersome. It offers much practical, how-to, information that I found quite useful as a mental health practioner but Ive not recommended it to any non-practioners. If someone wants to know about laughing yoga this book is useful. If they want to have more of a knowledge base regarding laughing yoga, keep looking. However, my search reveals, the resources are limited though the benefits to this practice are beginning to scientifically show promise."
3,The creator of the principle of laughter yoga,"I had long known that laughter is excellent for both mental and physical health, and I was very excited when I read an article about this author, who had figured out how to laugh without the crutch of a funny story, TV show, movie, or comedian to prompt laughter. There are techniques for learning to laugh on command.That said, this book alone is not the ideal place to learn this author's own technique. I downloaded an MP3 file that if full of helpful instructions on laughter yoga that I found much more useful, because it guides you through the techniques step-by-step. It is calledThe Laugh of Your Life."
3,If only this were the end of it,"For all of you who suspected this was going on - this will verify your suspicions. The bad thing is - while the fines to the businesses involved looked big, in terms of the contracts they got from the government, the fines were just a cost of doing business. Any one in the government today will be able to tell that this is not only still going on, but in terms of what the government is currently contracting out - it has gotten worse by multitudes. This book will educate you on how hard it is to develop a case against this type of ""crime"" and why it continues. It get's slow at times and some of the terms are used incorrectly, but this is the proverbial look at sausage being made. If you wonder why certain things are going on in government, this will certainly help you understand. A MUST read for all career government managers."
2,The alternative to an expensive academic book,Since the prior reviewers noted that this is a collection of papers presented at the Terra Pret Symposiums--I might recommend you Google Terra Preta and download the simple Powerpoint that exists online. It was made by a husband and wife who created their own Terra Preta soil in Irvine.
3,less bags than expected,"The only problem that I had with this order was the qty.In the description, it stated that a case weighs 3 lbs and has 500 bags.The product is not being sold as a case and I did understand that.This item does not state the qty, but it does state that it weighs 2 lbs.So, I was expecting more than 100 bags.Other than the qty, I was pleased with the bags and they are exactly what we needed to put in the public restroom."
3,Disposal Bags...not a good deal,The product description did not include the number of disposal bags included. My mistake as the number of bags provided was considerably fewer than expected for the cost.
2,Hopefully It Will Get Published Again Some Day,"I really wanted to read this book because of the concept, but it is out of print and there is no way in HELL I'm going to pay over $40 (Used!) for anything written by Terrence Dicks. His stories are like reading Cliffs Notes. If you don't believe me pick up the old paperback of ""The Five Doctors"". It's alot like reading a TV Guide (or Radio Times) blurb of the episode."
1,"Eight Doctors, and 284 pages of fluff!!!","Remember when Terrance Dicks wrote wonderful stories for the BBC television series ""Dr Who"". Good!!! Don't spoil that memory by reading this piece of rubblish. The characters that we fans love so much are depicted with all the depth of a thimble. The meaty descriptions of alien beings and worlds are given just enough substance to fill the bottom of an ash tray, while still not touching the sides. The only justification for this novel, would have to be if poor Terrance was heavily medicated, after a series of severe blows to the head, during the time that he was writing this. Hopefully his prozac perscription will run out before he puts pen to paper again. I know that you will more than likely buy this book too, just based on the fact that it is a multi-Doctor story...but you have been warned."
3,"Re: the review ""Call and response""","I wish to amend my review of last October. When I wrote it I hadn't read any other Doctor Who novels and had only recently reawakened my interest in the setting. On a second read after re-acquainting myself with the backstory, I find this novel sorely lacking. It's disproportionately uneven -- Terrence Dicks obviously is more interested in the third, fourth, and sixth Doctors than any others, and the treatment of the seventh Doctor is badly deficient -- and little is revealed, either about the eighth Doctor or about his companion, Sam, who seems a stock character pulled out of a hat. Later eighth Doctor books have been alternately good and bad, at least as far as I've read, and both characters have been fleshed out, but as an introduction to the characters, this one proves a disappointment."
1,Skip this one,"This should more properly be called ""Eight Doctors, One at a Time"" because unlike the televised episodes with the titles ""The N Doctors,"" the Eighth Doctor spends the book visiting one incarnation at a time in order. I advise anyone trying to start the BBC line of Who books to begin with ""Vampire Science."" ""The Eight Doctors"" is supposed to introduce the companion Sam, but she doesn't do anything related to the story until the very end where she jumps into the TARDIS (of which her casual acceptance is a bit strange to say the least). You get a much better picture of Sam's character in ""Vampire Science."""
5,A can't-stop-reading book.,"I don't know about a lot of people who have read this book, but I liked it. It started out a little like the latest movie, but immediately got very interesting."
4,"Not Great, but not awful!!",The Eight Doctors was a cute way of introducing the new Doctor. I think why people don't like it that much was because they expected a story as good as the five Doctors.
4,Fun light reading for Dr. Who fans,"This one gets smashed apart quite a bit by many Who fans, but I found it to be a fun read. Don't try too hard to get it to fit in with the past series of books and enjoy it for the nostalgia it is. Sort of like reading a Target novelization of a show that never could be."
3,A good read,"For the first story that is for the new 8th Doctor it could have been better, but it was a very easy read. I found that it went along pretty smoothly, but was confusing exactly what happened to the Doctor in the beginning of the story, causing him to visit his other selves."
3,"Lovely Music, Defective CD","I recently purchased this CD and the music is lovely BUT the first CD that arrived had a defective track that would not played; stuttered and skipped and would not play. I tried it on several stereos. I returned the CD to Amazon and asked for a replacement. It just arrived and the same track is defective on this CD. There must be a problem in the manufacturing. If you enjoy lovely relaxing music and don't mind one totally defective and irritating track, this is the CD for you."
1,RECORDING IS BAD,RECORDING IS BADTHE SOUND IS TOO SMALL EVEN I TURN UP THE VOLUME. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO EXCHANGE A NEW ONE ?I LIKE THIS CD BUT COULDN'T LISTEN IT WHILE I'M DRIVING.
4,A new and clear voice,"A co-worker went away to Brazil and came back with 50 CD's from Rio. Through her, I've only begun recently to develop an interest in Brazilian music. I was in a Tower Records recently where this wonderful artist's work was being spotlighted as a new release. It's only rarely that I listen to a CD in a store and decide to buy it based solely on the first cut.Subsequently I've listened to the whole album several times, and when I bring Ciranda into work with me, I have to remind my co-worker to give it back to me (she likes to put it on continuous play and just let it go). Faraco has a lovely voice and a poetic spirit, and I look forward to hearing more from him."
3,a little complicated to put together,My title says it all but I'm required to type more words here so I will keep typing until it allows me to submit
3,Interesting facts,But a bit oldfashined but interesting readDon't think I would pay the full amount for itFor free buy it any time
5,Lock it right,PLEASE USE THIS GREAT PRODUCT FOR KEEPING YOUR TOOLS SECURE IN THE TOYOTA PICKUP. IT INSTALLS WITH EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.
4,jsdegio,"Easy installation. The key lock cover is of rather flimsy and light sheet metal construction. This would appear to be a somewhat weak point. Nonetheless, it works and looks good."
5,Nice item!!!,I needed a locking tailgate after putting a cap on my truck. This installed easy and FAST. Whole process from start to finish took about one hour.Looks like it was a factory item. no drilling required. just needed a few basic tools. works great.
3,Pop & Lock,"In installed in 15 minutes and it looks as if it was made for the truck! Granted, anyone truly wanting to get into your truck bed would not be stopped by this, but is is useful to keep out the curious. Reasonably priced. Satisfied because I found the best price via Amazon!"
5,Tacoma PL5200 tailgate lock,"Lock works wonderfully and provides the protection I was looking for. Aesthetically it looks stock (not out of place or aftermarker) and it was also a breeze to install. Took me maybe 30 minutes from when I walked out the door to work on it to when I reentered my house. I youtubed some install videos beforehand just to make sure, and I'm glad I did because the instructions are pretty bad. Installing the lock will take you all of 5 minutes, the other 25 minutes will come from unscrewing and rescrewing the twenty screws you have to remove to access the lock mechanism--only part that was a PITA. Handle is a tad looser after install but it hasn't bothered me so far and it doesn't seem 'dangerously' loose--it still feels like a solid unit."
5,Just right,"This fragrance is for people who like a fresh scent. It doesn't smell too strongly of citrus, despite the name. And it's not smotheringly overpowering like so many women's perfumes on the market. I love it because it is sparkling for summer and can transition well into the cooler months with its spicy undertones, and it is just what I need in winter to keep me dreaming of the Mediterranean. L'Occitane makes great frangrances with unique scents that are distinctive, yet tasteful."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this book as a teaching tool for my music classes this year. So far, I'm over half way through the book, it is more of a history of New York and early America than a story of Fanny Crosby. Instead of learning about her, I'm reading about how the Irish and the catholics didn't get along and other political problems of the day. it's ok to put the person in the setting, but the setting is the focus. The writer even questions the character of Crosby by always being skeptical of her positive outlook on life. Although, she always has to come back and say that everything she wrote did point to that fact. I've been very unimpressed."
5,A valuable resource for the beginning designer,"I wish that I had discovered this book before I had graduated from design school. Not only does this user friendly book offer excellent advice from all the tops in the industry (done in short - to the point paragraphs), it is very informative as well. The book is divided into different sections on different types of design along with an interview of sorts with a person in that industry. What I found to be most informative was that at the beginning of each section there are recommendations on the types (as well as number) of pieces your portfolio should contain if you are interested in going for a job in that particular part of the industry. I would recommend this book to people in school, just graduating, or perhaps looking to reenter the job market in a different specialization of the field."
5,Wish I bought this book sooner!,I am finishing up by degree in Graphic Communications in December. I checked this book out of our school library and didn't want to give it back...so I bought my own! What I love about this book is that it breaks it down by industry and specialty area. I also like the way it breaks down what you should include in your portfolio for those areas. It is nice knowing that there is more to Graphic Design than just being a Graphic Artist in a print shop or a newspaper. This book gives you an idea and an overview on what's out there. Awesome!
5,good book for students,"This book is a good overview of what it means to be a graphic designer. It goes through the different areas of design, and different job positions.Everything you need to know about the design world is in this book."
4,Just What I Expected,"This book looks a little outdated, but that's just what I expected. The condition is good, and the price was the best available. Shipping was fairly timely."
4,Solid Return,"I've always admired Tania Maria's fiesty spirit - you can hear her zest for life in her playing and singing. At her best she uses both her voice and piano as a very unique sounding Brazilian percusion section, and this album has a great deal of that fiery magic. The first song alone was worth the price of the disk for me, and there is a lot to love throughout. Portuguese words over a Brazilian groove is about as beautiful as it gets in my book, and there is a lot of beauty in this disc."
3,Wagner Falls Short,"I have had this item fail on two ocassions. Both times it was the O-Ring that is located in the center of the plastic piston on the spring. A ONE CENT part can fix this issue but NO, they will not tell you the size of the o-ring so you can just pick one up. It was trial an error. But replaced the o-ring the second time and pressure was restored! Wish wagner would simply list the o-ring or at least just sell it."
4,FUTURE POP PUNK QUEENS,"Just listen to ""SOMETHING WRONG"" and you'll see why they ...rule. The sound as awesome as they dress. Chick bands are the only way to go. Screw all the guys! OTHER BANDS THAT RULE: JACKOFFJILL, DISTILLERS, HOLE, NODOUBT, GARBAGE"
2,looks . . . oh yeah! quality . . . hmmm,"The katana looks great! When I bought it, it a very nice feel to it and felt good in my hand. As far as looks are concerned, I would give it four-and-a-half stars. But when it comes to actual quality, as in whether you can really use it or not . . . well . . . it didn't last very long. I used it in a short film I made in several intense sword fights. By the end of the movie the blade was hopelessly nicked, scratched, and mangled and the sword itself had broken into three pieces! It is definately NOT full tang! Good for display, but not for actual use."
1,Author has no personal experience,"The description of this book states that for suicide survivors, ""their grief is unique..."" That is true for me from persoanl experience, having lost my son at the age of 22 to suicide, and that is exactly the problem with this book. The only authors who have helped me are the ones who have lived through this ""unique"" trauma. The authors who have no personal experience should stick to writing books about grief in general, or whatever else..."
5,5 stars for the workout (if you're okay with back bends!),"Several years ago, when I was doing yoga regularly, I would have considered myself an intermediate yoga practitioner. I want to get back to that level, so I purchased Power Yoga Total Body with Rodney Yee. This is a great workout! The sequences flow very nicely and Rodney talks through each step in a manner that allows you to focus on the pose rather than having to glance at the TV every few seconds (especially important when you're trying to maintain balance!). The pace is just right. BE WARNED: there are a lot of back bends in this workout, so if you are averse to those this is not the workout for you. Also, if you are a beginner, there is no point of reference for beginner modifications to the poses. It's just Rodney and his mat. But, overall, this is a good yoga DVD and a welcome addition to the fitness DVD rotation."
4,Get Ready!,"This DVD is great. Not for beginners, you really need to have an idea of names and poses. It keeps you moving for sure, I felt great afterward."
2,Just okay,This video just wasn't for me. I have practiced yoga for years and love it but I could not get into the routine. The instructor does about 30 minutes of a basic routine and then goes off on a tangent. I would not recommend for a beginner.
3,Not that great,"After reading the reviews I was expecting a more rigorous workout. I do a fair bit of yoga in a studio, but bought this for when I travel. This is much, much easier than the classes I've taken at a studio, so be warned if you're used to studio classes you may find this too easy."
5,Yee Does it Again,Rodney Yee is by far my favorite for all yoga instructors and he delivers in this DVD. I'm an intermediate level and this works great for me especially if I haven't practicted in a bit. It moves quickly but with great fluidity. Plus the scenery and music is splendid.
5,weight loss a side benefit,"I have never done any yoga prior to purchasing this dvd. I was mostly interested in getting my unlimber body stretched out a bit since I sit all day at work and am getting older. I have a pretty decent amount of activity otherwise, but always had trouble keeping the weight off. Well- to my surprise i dropped ten pounds in two months simply by adding the first 15-20 minutes of this routine every morning. Not only that I feel better, sleep better and even though the cold has kicked in my joints aren't having the occasional pains they were starting to develop once I turned 40. Rodney Yee has a straighforward and fluid set of poses that really seem to do the trick!! HIGHLY reccomended."
5,Not for the novice,"I have been practicing yoga for about four years and this is a great DVD. However, if I had tried this work-out two years ago, I would have been lost with the terminology and where to position my body. Overall, a great DVD for intermediate students."
4,Very strenous video,"I bought this video in November of 2003. I have only been doing Yoga for almost a year. It is challenging and I cannot do all the poses, especially the titibasana balancing pose but I have learned, over time to do the crane.Lots of up dog down dogs. It also starts off slow which lets you build up steam and warm-up. I love Rodney Yee.He is cool!"
5,"Challenging, yet relaxing","I have used two power yoga videos, one from Bryan Kest, and this one. And I much, much prefer this one. While I cannot yet do all of the poses, particularly the back bends, I can do the others well enough to get a fantastic stretching and even muscle toning workout. I don't see how anyone could get bored in any of the poses, and sometimes would even prefer to hold some of the passive stretches longer--so I pause the DVD and do just that! The entire presentation is exactly what my title says: Challenging enough to hold up to repeated viewings, yet wonderfully relaxing with Yee's controlled voice, presentation and pacing. You'll need to be in shape, yes, to do the entire program, but what a great goal to aim for!"
2,Not a workout,I started doing yoga to tone and burn calories. This video is very slow. I did not feel like I got a workout. Not for me.
2,Definitely not for beginners,I had the original AM yoga and it was great but I lost it so I bought this one and it was way more advanced that I expected. I wish it would have individualized the beginning and advanced parts. It flows right into each other which makes it difficult to follow. I will be buying the AM yoga again.
2,Yoga? Looks more like showga,"Bought several of Yee's DVDs hoping they would be another great set of power yoga. After trying the workouts, must say I am disappointed.Yee's approach to yoga is more like Showga - lots of graceful acrobatic moves without a focus on yoga's core principals. In stretchy, show-all shorts that could only be meant to get dates, Yee blazes through ~20 poses per minute. Breathing - an foundational yogic element - is not mentioned in some of his videos. A couple of the poses, particularly the twisting back stretch, are so poorly instructed, I question whether they are safe for beginners. While Yee's form is good he fails to mention how to perform the stretches safely.Yee appears to be an excellent practitioner and is undeniably a yoga rockstar. But his videos ignore core yoga techniques essential for a beginner."
4,a decent yoga video,"Rodney Yee is definitely easy on the eyes and this workout is a good one..It has some hard parts,but not TOO many..(The backbends are brutal)The tape covers all bases and i would reccomend it as part of a collection.."
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!!,"I have had some yoga training. I've taken classes here and there, but nothing serious. I was thinking when buying a yoga DVD that I didn't want a beginners one because I hate how they explain every single pose, so I bought this DVD thinking I'd be fine. I had to stop five minutes in because I had no idea what he was doing. I ended up sitting on my couch and watching the rest of it to get some slight clue about what was going on. Some workout! I think that this DVD would make no difference if it was on a CD to listen to, that is if you know all the yoga poses by name. Because you can't look at the tv when you are doing these poses or you aren't going to be having the correct form. Do not get this if you are a beginner or even if you don't have poses memorized. This is for advanced yogini's only."
3,more like power hatha yoga,If you already have the Power Yoga with the three separate workouts dont expect this to be a longer routine like I did. It is a longer workout but its pace and style is nothing like the Power Yoga for beginners at all.It is much slower and contains sustained poses. I was disappointed in a way because I wanted it to be a fast paced but longer routine.It has its merits for those who have done the AM/PM Yoga and the Beginner one. This is a good one to get once you have gotten the hang of the other DVDs.
2,Too challenging for me,"I am relatively new to yoga (about 9 months or so of consistent practice) and I found this dvd WAY TOO CHALLENGING. I could not keep up at all and was very discouraged by that. I didn't finish the workout and doubt I will return back to it any time soon. This is an advanced yoga workout, so just be aware of that before you order it."
5,Total Body Yoga,"I really like this workout for the body. It is not the best for the mind/spiritual aspect of yoga, but any video can be easilty supplemented with personal meditation. I like this video because I can choose to do the entire ""workout"" or I can pace myself. I recommend you watch the workout first, and then you can taper it to work for you."
2,Yoga Beginner,"I have only been practicing for a few months and wanted a tape with a total workout from beginning to end without stopping mid-stream to give ""examples"" of poses. However, the workout was a little too fast for me. Felt I was rushing to keep up. Poses needed to be held longer."
3,This is not for beginners,"Man, the first and last time I tried this I was sore for like 3 days. I guess that's supposed to be good, but damn. My arms and legs were on fire!!! I wish my stomach was hurtin' than I probably would have given this 5 stars, lol."
2,"good workout, distracting narration","This DVD is fairly decent as a workout, though a little repetitive. I haven't seen anyone mention this, but Rodney Yee has a serious lisp that is distracting, in addition to a few grammar problems (""groin"" does not take a plural). Also, I feel that Yee might not have the greatest understanding of yoga, as he switches from referring to bhujangasana as cobra AND upward dog, when they are THE SAME POSE. So in short, I feel like he's a ""celebrity"" instructor made famous by Gaiam and their pervasive marketing, but it could be worse. Although I practice yoga for flexibility and not for a spiritual purpose of any kind, Shiva Rea, Yoga Shakti is the only DVD I've seen that's truly worth owning."
3,I don't like power yoga,"Is this a aerobic good work out that uses yoga moves? Yes. But, I wanted a yoga DVD that was more focused on stretching, balance, and improving poses. When I want to do aerobics, I go to the YMCA. This tape is long (60 some minutes), but really needs to be longer to allow full exploration of the poses and movements and should be presented in chapters for more flexible workouts. I don't use it and am selling it at my son's school carnival."
2,Boring!,"I'm not a yoga buff, but I have the AM Yoga by Yee and like it, so I thought I'd try this one. I made it half way through and cut off the DVD, not because the poses were too challenging (and some of them were) but because I was so bored. I don't mind having to modify poses to suit my ability; that's part of what yoga is about. I'm sure that the moves would do what they should if I could have stuck it out. An hour of this is just too much."
2,Too fast and repetitive.,"I bought this yoga DVD to get an advanced yoga workout. Instead Rodney Yee gives a repetitive, dull and fast-forward yoga sequence. I don't really want to use it as a workout because I don't feel that it does what yoga is supposed to do... make your body and mind feel better and balanced. This workout just has you jumping in and out of mountain pose-down dog-plank-up dog and back to mountain pose. There is no time to find your balance in the pose, breathe and transition to the next... I kept falling behind until I finally just ended up doing my own yoga poses. The music and the scenery is nice, but Yee's fast-forward yoga is not for everyone."
2,not great yoga workout,Not enough power to increase heart rate for a cardio / weight loss workout and a poses were not held long enough to increase strength.
3,Too Much,"This dvd presented a workout that I found to be way over my head. I was done with the Yoga for Dummies and Beginning Yoga discs I'd been using for the past six months, but I wasn't ready for this one! It was too intense. It's not like with the ""New Sex Now"" dvd or even the ""Goddess Worship"" video, which anyone can use and follow along with easily. With this one you have to be almost a Yoga expert. I have found that using some Pilates workouts together with th 8 Minute Abs series has been the best for me so far."
4,Good step up...,"I had been doing beginner level yoga for about 6 months and just wasn't feeling overly challenged anymore so I decided to try to find a workout that was a step up. This was definitely a good fit for me. It isn't so hard that someone new to yoga cant do it, but it is fairly challenging. Rodney Yee does a great job of making the workout flow and increase in difficulty without you realizing it. It is a great addition to my workout regimen."
5,Road to Recovery,"I have yet to finish the video, because after 25 minutes I'm pooped, but so far I love it. I think it's an awesome workout and after 2 weeks I've definitely toned up a bit already. I do a little every day, as Rodney Yee says in his DVD interview. After only one day, I felt soooo much better (I've been dealing with increasing joint pain and fatigue despite getting regular body work, napping and eating a nourishing diet). I can't believe how much more energy I have. I feel at least 5 years younger. I could kiss Rodney Yee. I would recommend this video to people who've done yoga classes in the past because my previous experience helps me know what he is doing better than if I were just trying to copy his poses by looking at them. It's hard to watch carefully when you're in most of the poses!"
4,Good intermediate-level workout,"I really like this video. I'm a big Brian Kest fan, so this workout felt easier to me because Rodney moves through the poses fairly quickly instead of making you hold them for 15 breaths or so. But the flowing style is a nice change of pace, and the cueing is refreshingly minimalist. It ends with a nice series of stretching poses and I definitely feel that yoga buzz when I'm done. I could wish for a bit more upper body and ab work in this routine, but as a supplement to my other workouts it's a definite keeper."
4,Love this DVD!,I normally practice Vinyasa yoga at a studio but my current schedule doesn't allow me to attend classes regularly. Supplementing my practice has been a challenge until I came across this DVD. Rodney is a superb instructor. The flow of movement and clear instructions allows you to do the whole routine basically with your eyes closed.This DVD is probably best for someone with some experience under their belt. I am a former dancer who has been practicing yoga for 3 years. I found this DVD to be a perfect fit for my level of fitness and experience.
5,Worth Every Penny,This DVD has 4 different session and each one lasts around 25-30 minutes. Beginners and intermediate yogis (possibly advanced too) would enjoy enjoy this : ))
3,Gives you a GREAT workout but......,This dvd gives you a great workout and it's in the form of yoga which is pretty great. If you ever want to be buy a yoga dvd get it from Rodney Yee because he is the master of yoga. One has to be very flexible because Rodney does alot of stretches that requires you to be really really flexible. Sometimes when I thought he was finished he wasn't the dvd is really really long. Other than that it does provide you with a great workout and tones up your body.
5,Great Yoga DVD for your home collection!,"I absolutely love this DVD and it made a great addition to my home collection. I have started off slow and add more and more of the DVD as I am able to handle it. It is a good work out and quite challenging, but it definitely produces a difference in your body and your ability to do certain poses. I bought this after buying his beginners dvd and absolutely love both of them!"
4,Good for beginners too,The routine provides a great full-body workout. This was really my first experience with Yoga and I am able to follow 30-45 mins of the sequence before the positions become too advanced.
5,Really complete workout,"This video is great. I'm a beginner and I found this video to be just perfect for me. A lot of the spine exercises were challenging and I'm not really able to do it. But that's the beauty of the video. It's simple enough for beginners but also challenging enough that you're not bored. Just do what you can and with time, the sustained poses become more easy. And it's quite a workout. I'm usually wiped out by the end."
4,Perfect guidance for personal workout,If you have not time for training in sport club or prefer solitary way of workout its DVD for you.Aurthor in a very gentle way perform yoga exercises accompanied by detailed . but not boring explanations.
4,Great basic routine,"I have had this yoga DVD for longer than I can remember and I still come back to it from time to time. It's that strong. I have been practicing on and off for about 10 years, and on days I can't make it to a class I like to stay in practice with this video. It never fails to make me break a sweat!"
4,good but a little boring,"I like Rodney Yee's style, and have a few of his DVDs already. Power Yoga is great for a home practice, however since I got used to him it became somewhat boring. I recently started to alternate this dvd with the one I just got calledYoga for Power and Flexibility. The instructor's style is similar to Rodney Yee's, but it has more variety and overall seems more alive.I like to alternate those workouts on different days, and it works well for me."
5,Great workout,"This DVD provides the user with a great workout that is powerful, energizing and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who has already practiced basic yoga positions and are ready for a new challenge."
5,Great Yoga Workout,"This Power Yoga DVD is great for home practice, but be prepared to break a sweat! It is about an hour long and requires quite a bit of skill to accomplish the entire set. The beauty of a DVD is that you can stop and rest whenever you want without fear or embarassment (I know too many people who push themselves in yoga class only to get an injury or severe muscle soreness..)Some of the transitions are very quick. I am a real slow poke when it comes to getting in and out of downward-dog and I find myself a little behind sometimes on the DVD. This has improved with practice, but again it is something I am not embarassed about since I am doing yoga in the privacy of my own home.Rodney Yee's voice is very soothing and he coaches the movements really well. I love this DVD."
4,Nice workouts for the beginner or restarting yoga practitioner,"As an avid fitness person, I got away from yoga and focused more on running, and cycling and as a result, my hip flexors and shoulders became tight-it seemed like I was always re-injuring myself because I wasn't stretching enough, I lost a good amount of flexibility. I started back to yoga with Rodney Yee and this DVD. It has done wonders to open my hips and shoulders again where I'm ready to move onto more challenging asanas. There are a few power moves in this DVD to push you a little, but not too many where you are sitting on that matt trying to figure out how to possibly do them. Now I look forward to doing yoga again thanks to Rodney."
4,Rodney Yee Yoga,"Nice work out, head to toe. Core strength building. Explaned and deminstrated very well. Good to have in a collection."
1,hate this tape,"3 words, bad for you. this tape is bad for you. the postures are very strenuous on the knees and back for those who are not practiced, and anyone with irreperable knee damage. the way he sits and on bent knees and rolls around on his spine is only acceptable for someone in the best condition has supreme control out over their muscles and breathing. it is a dangerous tape for anyone else"
1,teribly disappointed,"I PLAYED THE TAPE ONCE AND IT WAS FINE. THE SECOND TIME I TRIED TO PLAY IT, IT WOULD NOT PLAY AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAD DISCARDED THE RETURN LABEL SO I HAVE A LOSS."
3,Lame,"This video shouldn't be called ""Power Yoga"" - there's nothing powerful, energizing, or strenous about it. I would recomend it to beginners and seniors, but not to anyone wanting a good workout."
3,Good for relaxation,"This yoga DVD is not an intense physical workout. I work out daily, and I found it to be quite easy on me. I did notice some tightness in my upper back the day after the first work out. Would be good for anyone needing no/low impact."
3,"Very repetitive, not much variety","I love Rodney's Power Yoga Stamina DVD, and thought I'd like a longer DVD of his to do.I found this one very boring, mostly Sun Salutations and Warrior poses, over and over. It also moved very slowly but didn't have much flow.I wish I would've bought another Ravi & Ana DVD (I own 3 and love them all) or perhaps another from Rodney's collection, like Strength or Flexibility."
3,Good workout but lacking variety,"This is a tough workout, however for $15 I would expect 2-3 different workouts on a video to introduce some variety."
2,Try another tape,"I generally like power yoga, but I agree that this tape is too repetitive and overall boring. There are so many other poses that could have been incorporated into the workout to keep it from becoming monotonous. I also don't like that there are no modifications - I'd love to be as flexible as Rodney Yee, but I'm not there yet. A much better workout is Bryan Kest's Power Yoga DVD."
2,Know What You're Doing First,"As a beginning practioner of yoga, I would have appriciated more guidelines as to the proper poses. Perhaps a short section in addition to the actual practice that explained the poses. The videography is lovely, and the workout is fluid, so more experienced folks will porbably love it."
3,More advanced than I thought,This seems to be a pretty good video but I wasn't aware it was as advanced as it seems to be. I tried it once but couldn't keep up. It really keeps you moving.I think it would be great for someone who already has an extensive knowledge of Yoga.
3,Not as good as Yoga Burn,"I bought this one, along with the Yoga Burn, to use in my room here on the base. I've done some yoga in the past but still consider myself a beginner. I really enjoyed the Burn DVD but this one... meh... Like the other one, this one is constant movement for the most part, which I don't mind. But Downward Dog is NOT the only position in yoga! Good grief!! Half the DVD is spent in this pose, and frankly, being upside down that much made me want to puke after a while. I went thru the other one and never once checked on the time because it flowed so well. This one I must have checked the time on at least 3 times, the first time only 24 minutes in. I will probably only do this one to mix up the routine a bit, but it won't be my go to by any means."
1,Power Yoga Total body workout,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I bought it based on the reviews thinking that it would be an intermediate practice with some challenging postures.The postures are very basic. Boring. No arm balances, no even twists....Bad...I suggest for those looking for power yoga with good sequence and poses that will make you sweat - Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest."
2,Definitely Beginner Level Workout,"I have done yoga on and off along with other types of dvd workouts including Jillian Michaels etc. Personally, I feel like this video was definitely a beginner level workout. I went into the workout slightly sore from the previous day's Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism video workout... I completed the entire 63 minutes and did not feel much different than I felt going in to the the workout. If anything it may have relieved my soreness a bit as the video includes a lot of stretching. Final thought: I will keep this video around for the sore day's, but do not recommend it if you are looking for a challenge or any type of body transformation. Hope this helps!"
3,He is very bendy,"I'm no yoga novice however some of this routine was pretty difficult for me. I look forward to advancing to be able to do some of these postures, but I think that I'd like it if there were some modifications that I could implement for my present skill level."
2,Definitely Not For Beginners-Very Fast Advanced Pace,"This DVD was very intimidating for me. I have practiced yoga intermittently for several years. I do not have much experience with flow style power yoga. For me, the poses were not held long enough. In fact, I could not move fast enough to transition to the next pose. The DVD was just too difficult for a beginning/intermediate student. If you have been doing yoga for several years and want a challenge, this is a great DVD."
4,great w/two or three caveats,"I enjoy this yoga workout - it's not for beginners and I don't attempt all of the poses but after a few days with the Yoga Journal's Yoga Step by Step DVD I found I was able to move through most of the routine...2 issues w/the DVD:1 - The music is worse than most Yoga or Pilates DVDs. Bad new age piano, harp, flute etc... that's almost intolerable. Why not offer alternate music tracks? How difficult would that be?2 - Poor chapter marking - since it is a difficult session, for a beginner it would be great to jump from the easier poses that make up the first 20 minutes or so to the relaxation poses at the conclusion. Then one could get a good workout at a beginning level. Instead the final chapter marker appeas to land several minutes priorto the concluding poses - I believe it's at leg streatches and ab work.Otherwise, it's a good DVD and of course Rodney Yee is always a pleasure to watch!"
5,Awesome DVD,I LOVE this yoga workout. Watch it once before doing it. I also think you should have a basic knowladge of yoga before doing it.
4,Speedy yoga,"Yeah, ok...so I'm not exactly as flexible as Rodney, but I found the pace a bit fast. This is definitely for the more advanced yoga-sters and it will give you a work out. Also, if you have a bad back or previous injury, watch out for some of the more strenuous ""rolling"" poses. I found it difficult to get in the breathing, which is the most important part of yoga. I like the routine though. Several of the poses are repeated so if you mess up the first one (or feel a bit wobbly), you have a chance to tighten up. By the end of the hour-long session, you will feel very relaxed and you will have earned the gallon of water you will consume. So kudos to Rodney for a great workout routine, but I may need to pause it now and then."
3,Whats the rush?,"Good quality picture and very nice postures, but you have to be quite advanced to be able to follow Rodney Yee. He is too fast! He knows what he is doing but teaching-wise this dvd deserves only 3 stars... Not recommended to those who are entry level students."
3,Just OK...,"I got this for my wife because she was looking for a good workout at home now that our schedule doesn't lend itself to attending classes. Based on the reviews we picked this one up and while it is OK, its just not great.Positions are not held long at all. Yee cycles through them far too fast to get much ""burn"". Most of the positions are fairly easy for someone in decent shape and very little time is spent on the few positions that really do challenge your muscles. It is still better than most out there but just not quite enough. It felt like the bulk of the session was warming up and cooling down with only a few minutes in between that made you really sweat.Its worth owning simply for an alternative but there has to be better out there. We will continue to look for a Power Yoga DVD that is a great, challenging workout routine (without the spiritual or meditative approach that others have)."
3,Fine for advanced yoga,"This was o.k.Pros:Nice setting, soothing musicGood workoutCons:Not enough explanations.Not good for beginnerspretty boring and monotonous"
4,Not for beginners,"Poses: This is not for beginners. Assumes you have knowledge on the poses. That being said, it has good flow from one pose to another and it does get more challenging as it progresses. In the video, Rodney Yee advised to just work at our own pace / strength and stop when it gets too difficult. I can only do up till minute 25 before I tire out or the poses get too hard. This just means that I'll keep coming back to this video until I can finish the whole thing.DVD and camera work: Good quality."
4,good sequence,"If you are familiar with postures and sun salutations and don't need to be talked through the pose, this is for you. It gets right to the point and you get right into it. It starts in mountain and goes through the sun salutations gently and then incorporates warrior 1,2 3 and side angles and then gets into back bends and seated postures. I wouldn't call it so much of a power dvd as I would a total body dvd. The only thing missing was some inversions but definitely enjoyable all together."
4,Nice ending stretch,"This is a great power yoga workout with a nice, long stretch sequence at the end. It totals about 1 hour and the last 20-25 minutes is all stretch (forward bend, twist, cobbler, etc.)If you're looking for a really intense power yoga workout, this is probably not for you. You might want to try the Bryan Kest workouts. If you are looking for a really good, smooth flow with some good power vinyasas, then I recommend this one. It starts off very slowly and gradually progresses into more challenging vinyasas, and as I said, ends with a good stretch. I feel very energized after doing this workout.The only draw back to this DVD, and the reason for only 4 stars, is Rodney's voice. His cues are great and easy to follow, his voice is just a little loud compaired to the music and not at all soothing. He does not have the soft, flowing voice that a lot of instructors have. This just makes for a little less relaxing workout.Overall, a very good video."
4,Definitely challenging for beginners.,"I bought this as my first yoga video. DON'T buy this as your first yoga video.Don't get me wrong, it provides an EXCELLENT workout. But, as many other reviewers noted, it moves very quickly and it is hard to follow if you are unfamiliar with the poses. Even after watching it a few times, I still find myself pausing every 10 minutes or so to catch my breath, grab a drink of water, move the mat back into place and catch up to the position that he's in.If you want to get a great workout and you feel pretty comfortable with your level of yoga knowledge, you'll like this tape. If you're just starting out, try something else."
5,tuff,"Ever since I took that rocking yoga class in south florida, I've been in search of a video that remotely strenghtens and works me as tough-ly as my teacher used to. This video is not for beginners, but Mr. Yee is so convincing, that I did a back bend for the first time, something I didn't even do when I took that class many moons ago. Not for the faint of heart, it will make you sweat. It will also make you sore, but it is a total workout, in the best possible way."
1,Too slow and has very little flow.,"I recently bought Power Yoga, Total Body Workout and unfortunately it is very slow and has zero flow to it.His motions are exaggerated and are not in a manner that anyone could follow easily if they wanted to really feel any breathing or streaching from power yoga.The scenery where he is practicing is lovely but that's about it. Bummer."
1,bored,"I love yoga, but could he make it any more monotonous? It is a physical challenge, but mentally it gets old before 1/4 through it."
2,Disappointed,I have been doing yoga for several yrs. Power yoga was a disappointment to me. Too much repetition of forward bending poses and seems like he has reduced yoga to a aerobic weight loss work out.Don't waste your money.
1,Guru Gone Wrong,"Th actual DVD is good and I use it often.With that being said, sadly, I can't support the sales of Rodney Yee. He was kicked out of the Yoga Alliance for dating his students. He left his wife and 3 children to marry a model / fellow guru. I don't trust his motives. Google search him. There are a lot of articles about his unscrupulous transactions. You decide."
1,so boring,"This is very boring to me. It is narrated (by Rodney?), so you don't really feel like you're part of a class. Workout seems repetitive. Also, the spandex shorts are, shall we say... umm... disturbing."
3,Power Yoga - Rodney Yee,"For someone who does yoga at least once a week, I thought this dvd was OK. The tempo of this video is too slow for me. The pace should have been picked up a little more. Granted some of the poses were a little difficult. I would recommend this yoga dvd for someone who has never tried yoga or is a definite beginner."
3,"An easy read, but ultimately unsatisfying","As a fan of mysteries with a supernatural background, the title compelled me to pick this book up in a second hand store. It is written in a style that is easy to read and some of the characters were sympathetic. It's not in the league of Hake Talbot's ""Rim of the Pit,"" but it's not exactly bad, despite a few incidents that I felt were superfluous to the story. I guess this is a slight recommendation, not a glowing one, though."
1,Don't bother,"Very poorly written. Thin plot, no character development, writing is very amateurish. Really doesn't deserve even one star."
1,"Nasty, snobbish and mean","I found this to be poorly written, thinly veiled snobbish rubbish. Ms Safra is portrayed as a social climbing, nasty piece of work, but at the same time surprisingly well liked by more or less everyone around her. The author is constantly talking about ms Safras garish taste (a crime that in itself should prove to everyone that she must also be guilty of double homicide) and her 'middle class' background (the horror!)."
5,Republished?,"I just found another Amazon listing for this same title and author, published only days ago in paperback. Does anyone know if this is the same book or a severely edited version?"
4,A Delicious Read...,With all that has been written about Lily Safre and the scandal this book caused in international society I searched high and low for a copy of the original book. When that failed I read this version which did not disappoint. I was immediately sucked into the tale of the ambitious woman believeing very much that it was the spiiting image of Lily Safre. The writing is very good for a book like this with plenty of details and background. Quite franly I did not want it to end and wish the author would do a follow up. Fun. Fun. Fun.
4,i guess...,i have only used one bottle so i guess i didnt get the full effect but i guess that one bottle worked well...i guess. not quite sure of why i should pay that much for this type of product ever again but...i guess
5,great,I have tried this product just over nite and i have to say it's great!!! my bumps cleared up by morning.
4,Very Good for a Soft Case,"As usual, Sony equipment is pretty good, and I'll buy Sony stuff without question. BUT...The case has a main drop-in compartment for storing the camera, and a front flop-down pocket lets one store three batteries and three 3-inch CDs. Both the main compartment and the pocket are double-zippered.I bought the eye-level viewfinder and it will not fit into the case when attached to the camera. When not attached, it will fit into the compartment, but then only on top of the camera, making it subject to squishing if, say, somebody decides to sit on the case.The Mavica fits into the case back-first and lens up. That means to remove the camera one must grab it by its lens. Somehow I have a problem with that, but after four years of working with the case and camera that hasn't been a problem.I originally gave this case a 3-star review, but, as mentioned above, after actually using it for several years, it rates 5 stars as a soft case."
3,Sony Soft case for FD,"The quality of the case is good, but actually the case seemed a bit too small to keep everything in...tight squeeze and no extra room for disks to take along. Where to squeeze everything in was the biggest problem I encountered. Actually I got it in Dec. and here I am still trying to figure it out!"
2,Multiple quantities don't fit together,"I purchased 2 sets of these mats. The quality of the product is fine, however, each set was shipped separately in HUGE shipping boxes - it makes no sense to be so wasteful, especially when it is coming from the same vendor. Also - when I went to put the 2 sets together, they do not fit! This is quite frustrating."
3,"Good, but not about Sherlock or Mycroft Holmes...","Nicely written and engaging, this book is well worth reading. Some of the other reviews cover details of plot, so I'll say only that I found it a good read with few shortcomings. But readers who are looking for a Sherlock Holmes story should be warned that this isn't about Mycroft or Sherlock."
4,A good page turner,"This is the sort of book that is worth reading when you have pockets of time like on the train or bus in the morning or at night when you have a little time to yourself in the tub. It is a wonderful story, which I wouldn't be surprised if some of the elements are factual!!!"
3,Better than his first book,"This is an somewhat interesting book, better written than the author's first book. However, we still get the feeling that he doesn't really care about the characters, the plot is disjointed, and the end reads as though the author suddenly lost interest, and left out material that would have made the end more logical. Still, I liked it and I hope he keeps trying."
3,Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots,Fun to try the stuff in this book. It really helped my game to make some of the shots by practicing them out of the book and then seeing them in a regular game.
4,Byrnes Complete Book of Pool Shots,Excellent reference to have around. We just had our pool table installed and plan on using this a lot in practicing shots.
5,Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots,"This book is ""da bomb"" for anyone wanting to learn the game. I bought this book as a replacement for one that was ""permanently borrowed"" from me some time ago; so I offer a word of caution...this book has a way of growing legs if you lend it out.Anyway, the information in this book has the potential to take you from beginner to advanced if you apply yourself, i.e. practice, practice, practice!Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots: 350 Moves Every Player Should Know"
5,Pool,This is a great book!!!!!!!!! If you like pool you will learn and enjoy the witty narrative at the same time
5,350 Moves Every Player Should Know,"I have been playing pool for twenty years and this book introduced so many concepts that I don't know why I didn't research this book out sooner. This book single handedly improved my game dramatically. If you shoot pool and are looking for a deivice to train you from the begining to advanced stages look no further, this book is spactacular!"
5,Great collection!,"I've got to admit, I'm not proud of my initial reaction to these wonderful selections -- that they seemed ""atypical"" of what I think of as the Italian-American perspective. But I guess that's the point of the book, and certainly it's part of what great writing does: it divests us of our biases by revealing our common humanity. Bill Tonelli has made an excellent book."
3,textbook,It wasn't bad for a textbook... It did the trick and was exactly what we needed for class... not to bad of a read
2,Unnecessary,"If my instructor did not mandate that all students buy this book, I would not have spent money on it. I don't think this book is necessary for anyone taking a college-level English course. It reviews basic grammar rules and writing styles. Unless your instructor specifically states that you will be doing work out of the book, I wouldn't purchase it."
4,Poor Organization Disguises Excellent Material,"I am a Nashville-based technical writer. In an attempt to maintain the grammar side of my job, I pulled out my copy of this book. I have been reading it--cover to cover.I purchased this book while working on my graduate degree a few semesters ago, but it was so poorly organized that I placed this it in my desk.Since digging into it, I discovered pages upon pages of valuable information.If the publishers put a little more time into the organization and ""user-friendliness"" of this book, what a treasure it would be!"
1,Worthless Junk - Might Be Good Boat Anchor,I'd give it -1 star if I could. Won't jump a dead battery and Coleman won't have anything to do with it so God help you if you lose/misplace/break a part. More Chinese cr@p for our US landfills.
1,Jumpstart System does not work at all,"My Coleman Jumpstart unit has never been used. It will not take a charge. Has been connected to electricity for 24 hours, red light is the only light on. Can any one help? Very unhappy in Wisconsin!! Buying this Coleman product was like throwing money away. Beware!!"
4,Not bad for free.,"I bought a fifth wheel toyhauler a year ago. It came with a really cheap Chinese version of this, which didn't work at all. The dealer replaced it with one of these Coleman units. I charged it, but never used it until yesterday. I was told it was meant for jumpstarting ATVs and motorcycles, so I can understand it not working well on a larger vehicle.But yesterday, my little Honda Prelude wouldn't start, and I thought I would give this thing a try. Sure enough, it worked... BARELY. It worked again this morning too. I think I'm due for a new battery and alternator in the car, so that's my next move. Meanwhile, this little thing will definitely be kept handy from now on."
1,Internal Battery Eventually Dies,"I've owned one of these Coleman units for five years. I keep it plugged in and ready for use with a power inverter to provide AC power for a lamp or radio during a power outage. Never had to jump a car with it (looks like that was a good thing). After five years, I noticed that it is no longer holding a charge. The built in lamp glows but only at half power. The power supply/charger is working fine so it appears that the internal battery is shot.I have a similar starter kit made by Sears that I've had for almost ten years and still works great for jumping cars and running a small lamp during power failures."
3,good but not great,"I bought this reels after trying the 33 platinum. While the 33Platinum is great and well ahead of the standard 33, this little reel didn't seem to be that much better than the regular version. I think the problem is that the spool diameter is so small that the problems this causes make it a bit of a line twister no matter how many bearings it has. I like the 11 and use it for panfish but make sure that you carry a supply of line so that when it gets too twisted to work well, you can just rip it off and reline the reel. The platinum doesn't effect this problem so I would prefer having two or three of the regular reels than spending the extra money on the higher grade reel."
2,Capresso - 4 month filter,Filter does what it can but they dont seem to last very long and are difficult to clean. Will buy again but not happily
3,Capresso 750.09 size-4 cone GoldTone Filter,I bought this to save our earth by ditching the paper filter. My husband said that he can tell the difference in taste but I couldn't. I notice that there is fine coffee grind on the bottom of each cups. It is like European style coffee where it leaves a dark trace on the bottom. I like it because I am not making any trash (coffee grinds goes to the garden) but I do not like it because I have to waste about two sips of coffee per every cup.
2,Didn't fit my Capresso,"This product looked like it would be right for my Capresso, but it was too big (high). I had to return it. Product looked like good quality. It's too bad it wouldn't fit because I can't find one to replace mine. If anyone knows where to get a smaller one, let me know."
3,Gold Tone Cone Filter is medium grade,I have used gold tone filters for sometime now and for the price of this particular model I find it to be a mid-grade product. I find the materials and workmanship to be acceptable but fear it may not hold up over the course of time.
2,Not sure if really a Capresso product,"Filter does not have ""Capresso"" anywhere on product. It is smaller than the basket that holds the filter in my Capresso coffee machine. And after 3 uses, the gold has worn off on one side. I doubt that this is a real Capresso goldtone filter."
4,Replacement Filter,I thought this would be an exact replacement which came with my coffeemaker.It is well made but it is smaller in height then the original.Luckily I don't make large pots of coffee.If you find the exact one you need this is a good buy.
4,Great all around filter,"The filter is great for most grinds of coffee. I do grind mine a little more fine than most and unfortunately I do wind up with a minor amount of ""mud"" at the bottom of my cup. If you grind your own coffee stick with a more course grind and this filter is excellent!"
2,I like paper filters better - maybe just a personal choice,"I ordered an extra GoldTone Filter for convenience. We bought a new coffeepot that recommended the gold filters. After making a few pots, I discerned that a pool of muddy coffee remained in the bottom of every cup and also in the carafe. The coffee itself was okay, but not great. I tried a paper filter, and the coffee was wonderfu,l and there was no muddy residue left in the cups and carafe. I'm for paper filters!The gold filter was well made and etc., but I think paper filters work better."
4,Tinnitus:Turning the Volume Down,Filled with helpful information for the beginner with Tinnitus - answers all the questions. Good source book
3,"Please, Kevin, employ an editor!","Overall this book contains a lot of good information, is objective and is honest about one's options with tinnitus. But, the writing style is awful. It reads like it was written five paragraphs at a time without going back to see what was written previously. Very repetitive. And, Kevin, when you do find a good editor and he or she wants to eliminate ""quotes"" and superfluous words, swallow your pride and listen. You don't, for example, have to say ""but by no means limited to,"" after each use of the word ""including."" He or she will tell you that the phrase adds nothing. This is correct. Listen to them. Your book will be much better for it. And, I suspect, about 50 pages shorter.Your heart is obviously in this. Trust me. Find an editor. You will help more people."
1,fake,"With a VERY SMALL about of web research after finding no educational background info listed on his site, it looks like his ""Doctorate"" (Psy.D.) is a BIG FAKE:""Kevin Hogan claims he has a ""PhD in metaphysics"" from American Institute of Holistic Theology www.aiht.eduThis is an unaccredited fluff diploma mill.And whatever he says he got, its in ""metaphysics"" which sounds like the same type of bogus degree that Joe Vitale bought.Kevin Hogan also makes some hypnosis claims about attending the...American Institute of Hypnotherapy (Irvine, Calif), which does not seem to exist anymore.""The skimpy girls on his supposedly professional home page was an obvious caveat..."
5,Great Book!,I have Tinnitus and this is the first time I have read anything that has given me any hope. He speaks as if he is your friend and out for your good! I ordered his cd package..not through with that yet. Very informative book.
2,Save Your Money and Time,"Being a sufferer of Sudden Hearing Loss and subsequent tinnitus I purchased this book for some guidance on dealing with the infliction. The book did explain tinnitus as best as is currently medically understood but did not provide any viable or practical methods of reducing the ringing as the name of the book implies. The book is 260 pages, which in my opinion, could have been captured in 30. It kept repeating the same material over and over again just arranged differently. If you're looking for solutions on dealing with Tinnitus, I wouldn't recommend this book. The only thing it did for me was to make me more aware of the ringing in my ear while I was reading it. That's about it. You could get the same information from the American Tinnitus Association from free."
2,Huge Disappointment!,"This book was a huge disappointment. As one reviewer pointed out, most of the positive reviews appear to be from colleges or students of Hogan, or people who have attended one of his seminars. I doubt they even read the book, and instead just gave it good reviews based on their experiences with him. I'm sure he is a pioneer in his field and does indeed know a great deal about tinnitus, and can/has helped people. However, this book IMO falls very short. The 200 plus pages could have easily been condensed to 20 or so. Many chapters cover the same topics as other chapters, and he rambles on and on about things that will not help you ""Turn down the volume"". In closing, the book does offer a handful of tactics that may help; some of those will seem like common sense to most folks. Just be prepared to read through a lot of crap just to get the information that could have been printed on AT LEAST 1/4 this books size."
1,Not helpful,More like a pep talk than anything. All the info in this book is available free by doing an internet search. Waste of money.
3,A Good Souce of Tinnitus Information,"This is a very informative book, but don't get to excited, even though it got great reviews. I'm a college student suffering from Tinnitus. I ordered this book to try and learn about the different treatments available and hopefully find one that I can begin. This book did a very good job explaning the treatments and telling you where to get started on the recovery process. However, in order to do the things the author suggests to fight Tinnitus you would have to have lots of free time and extra money. And being a full time student at a major University I have neither of these. I wish I could devote everything I have to fighting this, but I can't. And I think most people can't. So if you just want to learn about Tinnitus I would highly recommend reading this book, but if you are looking for an immediate cure...see a doctor who has knowledge in this area."
4,Well informed.,"This book has a lot of information in it for the person who has sevier tinnitus,I happen to be one of these people,and i plan to use this information to the best that i can.Thank's for the book and i hope to see another one soon. Mike."
1,I should have read the reviews first,"I have never bothered to submit a review before but after being largely disapointed with this book, I felt I should. Then I find others have already noted there is very little of actual worth in the book and that much is just rehashing and inducement to buy further products. I should have read the existing reviews before I bought the book !"
2,Drug recommendation,I read enough of this book to come to believe that the main recommendation is to be put on psych medications to lessen the problem.
3,star necklace,"The chain is great and its 17in, much better for some of us than a 16 in. the star is quite small, I would have liked a bigger one. It came in a nice gift box which surprised me. I would reccomend it to anyone with teenagers as a gift for them."
5,Kenwood 10 inch shallow sub,I have this hooked up in my single cab truck behind my seat in a sealed box. It's wired to the class D kenwood excelon monoblock amp that is 300 watts rms at 4 ohms and it stomps!! My side mirrors shake and my rearview mirror goes crazy! I have had this in for almost 2 months now without any problems at all.
5,His Dark Materials Trilogy,Looks arrived in excellent condition. I am so glad that i can read this for myself vs. having someone tell me that this anti-christ.First 2 books are very good. The last one is a little deep to get thru.
5,Great Writer!,"I will be 60 years old this year and love to read good books. These are good books. Philip Pullman has a great imagination. I am almost finished with the last one and will cut this review short so that I can get back to it. Can't wait to go see the first movie. By the way, some of his ideas aren't fantastical."
1,Bargain Basement Bound,I just read the Golden Compass from the trilogy and must say this is the worst book I've ever read. I don't even want to read the others. It lacks creativity and character. It really just leaves you wondering what the point of the story was. I can see this one heading straight for the bargain rack. Don't waste your money!
1,This is not for children or young adults,"Children are impressionable and in my opinion shouldn't read stories in which the plot revolves around the supreme blasphemy, namely, that God is a liar and a mortal. I believe it is not appropriate for children to read books in which the heroine is the product of adultery and murder priests act as professional hit men, torturers and authorize occult experimentation on young children an ex-nun engages in occult practices and promiscuous behavior, and speaks of it openly with a 12-year-old couple and the angels who rebel against God are good, while those who fight on God's side are evil. This is wrong. And while it's been softened in the movie -- or at least that's what Hollywood is telling us -- it's still there in the books."
2,struggling to finish,"There are SO many other good books out there to read...I started this due to all the ""wonderful"" reviews and now I am struggling to finish the series. I cannot wait to finish it and post the set on paperback swap.... as I will not be sharing this with my neices."
3,Mediocre,"Compared to ice and fire series. It is a mediocre series. A great book is about describing characters. The world this book created does not fully make sense. Maybe good for teenagers. But if you need something with more depth, this is not the book series for you."
3,"Very good writing, but the last two books need to rething the message.","This author is very good, but he isn't sending a good message to young people. Maybe that wasn't his intention because fiction books are, after all, only imagination. His stories are fabulous, but what will be the after effects?"
5,Great Book,"I thought that this was an excelent book, not only is it written for kids, but it also is written in a way that adults can enjoy it. And to the people that say this book is just about a kid destroying god. They are wrong, it has some inclanations to that but its just a book, they are just taking it to the extreem. if some one told me they were not going to read it because of those acusations, I would tell them they are missing out on a great book."
2,Review of The Golden Compass,"Philip Pullman's Trilogy was highly touted as the last great fantasy work of the 20th Century alongside C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I began to read The Golden Compass after having seen the movie, which was well produced. I found the literary quality of Pullman's work poor and would in no way classify this good or great literature. In terms of theme, the fantasy seeks to develop and explore an atheistic worldview. Thus, for example, one of the positive characteristics of Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist, is courage. But in an atheistic framework, this only amounts to self-assertion against all odds and authority. The value of such a work for our children is questionable."
5,THESE ARE THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!!!,"By the end of the first chapter, you will be ready for the next book. It's that captivating. Never before have the complex issues of science, religion, love, innocence, and growing up been addressed in such a tasteful and understandable way. The characters are easy to identify with and, while there isn't much humor, the edge-of-your-seat suspense will keep you turning page after page after page. And when you're done with the entire trilogy, you'll beg for more. These books are my most prized possesion, and Philip Pullman is my all-time favorite author. READ THESE BOOKS!!! You'll never want to put them down."
1,Disappointing,"I read all three books, and I enjoyed the first one. By the middle of book two, I kept going because I had already invested so much time and surely, I thought, the books would get better. I thought the third book was entirely tedious, and the ending was anti-climactic and disappointing."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I reviewed all the books individually, going from five sta5rs for book one, then plummeting to one star for book three. I would give the overall series a 2. I have no axe to grind with Mr. Pullman's opinion of religion, but I do resent his letting it get in the way of competently completing his story. (And how anyone can think that religion, particularly roman Catholicism, is not the main focus of the story is beyond me.) The Amber Spyglass is a muddle from start to finish, with so many different ideas tossed together yet never developed that it was an exercise in frustration to force myself through to the ending. He has a great imagination, but he is as zealous and self-righteous in his own opinions as the Chruch that he is railing against. While that may be good fodder for a story, it is not in itself a good story. Hugely disappointing."
3,"Entertaining, But Nothing Special","... They're good, not great, and nowhere near amazing. There, I said it. Now read the reasons.I applaud Phillip Pullman on his spectacular imagination, which has created a world parallel to ours in which all people have daemons in the form of animals, the church has almost complete control over our lives, armored bears rule kingdoms in the arctic, and God himself is a lying slimeball. ...There are two major problems. One is the surprising lack of humor. I can think of one funny part in ""The Subtle Knife"" and about three in ""The Amber Spyglass."" And don't look for much in the way of wit. The second is the finale. While this could have ended on a thought provoking and mystical note, it instead has to go for a sappy cliche about how we need to do the best we can with where we are and what we have (Awwwwwwww...).P.S. Don't read these if you are easily offended by anti church slander."
5,I was sad when the story ended!,"His Dark Materials is simply incredible. Ignore all the fake negative reviews from the people who are afraid of a book like this. Open your mind and read it for yourself! If you're a person of faith, and you don't think you can read this, is your faith really so strong?The plot, characters, stories formed a beautiful, mysterious and thought provoking story that I wish never ended. I was literally sad when I finished, because it was hard to say goodbye to the characters and world within.(by the way, ignore the ""A Kid's Review"" as I'm not a kid.)"
4,Inspired,"Wow, what a lot of venom from the bible bashers, sounds like an organised campaign from their programmersI just have to get it to sit on my shelf next to Narnia."
5,Keeps you begging for more!,"As soon as I started to read this trilogy, I couldn't put it down! I recently finished the last installment, The Amber Spyglass, which I spent all of my free time reading. I highly suggest this book to any reader who likes mystery and fantasy books. My English teacher even suggested this book to my class for a project we will be doing, and she herself said she enjoyed Philip Pullmans other published works. So this book isn't just for young readers, but adults as well. However, these books do contain violence and the details are described in great detail, so very young readers should not pick this book up."
4,Read These Immediately,"This series is incredibly well done. It is much darker than Harry Potter, but it satisfies on the same level. The goodies and the baddies aren't always easy to label, and there are surprising and sad twists and turns of the plot. There are also some interesting theological questions to think about without putting forth a religious ideology of any kind, and all this is tied up in a rip-snorting good story about people we'd love to know.Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"" and ""Ender's Shadow"" are good in this way also. Happy reading!"
2,The Hype,"I had heard lots of good things about this series for a long time so I finally broke down and bought it. As a reader of fantasy for 10+ years I have read plenty of good stories and bad ones. This story isn't one of the bad ones but I caution those of you like me who read alot of fantasy, Don't Believe the Hype.For a longtime fantasy reader this story will be simple in plot and beyond simple in writing style. I could see this being ranked high as a Young Adult book but put up against other mature fantasy stories it is highly lacking."
4,A Fine Trilogy,"While I feel this story could have been told in one or two books, they all moved quickly and I was constantly interested. I greatly suggest this series!"
5,Great Read,"I wanted to read the book after I saw the movie for The Golden Compass, my sister was kind enough to purchase it for me. I couldn't put it down once I started- I finished it in about 3 days. I liked that the trilogy was all in 1 book since I like to back track sometimes."
5,Not Ordinary Fantasy,"The stereotype of fantasy is a good guy pitted against a bad guy in a magical battle to save the world.This is certainly NOT that.These were truly some of the best books I have read. These aren't just simple fantasy books for children or young adults; these will be enjoyable and thought-provoking even to the parents. It is true to realistic events and real characteristics. No character is purely good or evil. The books seem so real you forget that it's fiction after a few pages. It all seems possible. Subtle debates about issues appliable to real life carry through the trilogy.A word of caution, however: some material may be offensive to Christians, though I have seen few who were offended and would suggest reading it with an open mind. The material is open to interpretation."
1,Anti Christian,"While I admit that Pullman has considerable skill as a writer, I'd like to warn others that these books are blatantly anti-Christian. Do a simple Google search of the authors name or the book titles and you'll find plenty to concern you IF you are Christian."
1,What a blasphemous series!,"I picked these books up at a used book sale. The first half of the first book didn't even make sense with all the new terms mixed in a parallel universe. The second book was better at explaining things, but had some questionable material. The third book was downright sacriligious. The ""good"" guys are out to challenge the ""Authority"" who is just a really really old angel, and to replace society and religion. The church is seen as nothing but a mindless enemy. I destroyed my copies, and I hope with this review, some parents will think twice about allowing their children to be exposed to such filth. It's amazing that this offensive stuff even gets printed."
2,A definite read for all callus anti-Christian bigots.,A definite read for only the most callused anti-Christian bigot. It is unfortunate that this author's adequate skill at story telling is lost on such a blatant bigot. His intolerant views are forced into this story unnecessarily. The bigotry adds nothing needful to the plot. Even at the point when he kills God it is so anticlimactic you barely noticed that it has occured. The story could easily have been told without his trite narrow-minded views clouding an otherwise good story.
3,not niel gaiman but still good,"this book was pretty good. If anyone has ever read Gaiman's ""neverwere"" it vaguely resembles that. It is very creativily written but not quite as good. I know I enjoyed this series emesly but be sure to get all three, it never really ends until the last one (amber spyglass)."
3,Acceptable,"I loved the first two books, and I thought the 3rd would be the best. I was far mistaken. The third book had a huge rise to a tiny climax. It just isn't anywhere close to the caliber of the first two. I will rate book 1-5 starsBook 2-4 starsBook 3-2 stars"
5,An Excellent Box Set,"Enclosed in a colorful box - the cover of the book, The Golden Compass - this is an excellent way to purchase the complete His Dark Materials Trilogy.The slightly-oversized paperbacks provide ample room for a highly-readable font. With the focus on the release of the movie - The Golden Compass - it is a bit surprising that the book only has one movie photo, but that does not detract from an attractive box-set of three classic fantasy novels from Philip Pullman."
4,The Golden Compass,"The Golden Compass is a book that you would really like, if you love adventure. The main character is Lyra who tries to save her friend Roger from the gobblers. The book is a little sad at the end, but very good overall. At the end,Lyra's father opens up a gateway between worlds which leads you to the next book."
5,Excellent - Unbelievably so,"I received The Golden Compass as Christmas present probably 4 years ago (ironic, these books as a Christmas present) and never touched it. Finally I picked it up and read. I was hooked and went out and bought The Subtle Knife only days later, proceeded to devour it, and luckily, The Amber Spyglass has just been released. Wow, these are probably my favorite 3 books ever. And that's saying something, because I've read a LOT of books. The are very obviously Anti-Christian, but never the less, I found the matters discussed very fascinating. Actually, it reminded me a lot of the movie Dogma, believe it or not, thought Dogma was decidely pro-Christian. Anyways, go read these books, they are the best."
1,Pullman Trilogy,"Mr. Pullman's trilogy is well-crafted, although his inventions fade rapidly after reading (unlike Lewis's Narnia, which remains mint-bright in the mind). The trilogy is also teeming with religious hatred, specifically of Christianity and Christians. As a parent, a college professor, and someone who respects all religions, I find this incomprehensible and unacceptable. I would strongly recommend that parents avoid buying these books for their children; if a child does read this trilogy, parents and educators should make every effort to point out to the child Mr. Pullman's bigotry, and perhaps discuss the dangers of all prejudice: religious, racial, ethnic, national, and so on."
1,Blasphemy at its best,"I agree that Pullman pulled this series off with intricate plot and interesting creatures / characters. However, I cannot continue to finish book three when the story enfolds the so called dark side of God and the explicit condemnation of the name of God. The fabrication of events in heaven and the creation of man are misleading to young readers. I strongly recommend parents not to buy these books for their kids."
5,simply gorgeous.....,"Not only has Phillip Pullman created a world of dark fantasy filled with things that pull at the depths of your imagination, his writing uses enough reality to make the events seem almost possible, but elusive, like a flash of movement that just catches in the corner of your eye.They could be a little bit hard to follow at times, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with a short attention span. The violence wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been; most twelve-year-olds could probably stomach it.These are definitely books to buy and read over and over. I'm loathe to compare them to ""Harry Potter,"" but both series share an aspect of adventure and mystery that keeps you enthralled right until the very end. A must-read if I've ever found one."
3,Reading each page twice,"I am eleven and a pretty good reader. But, I feel so confused. I am reading this with my mom and she seems to be at a loss for words for me. She reads all the time (all the Harry Potter's twice in one or two days) and is pretty smart, but we have to reread alot because we don't understand it. It's like the author expects us to know what he is talking about in the beginning. We are getting to the good parts and understanding more and more, I was just wondering if other kids had such a hard time getting in to it. We have not read any sci-fi before so maybe that is the problem. We also have no problem with religion. I hate to abandon a book, but with school starting I don't know if I should stick with it or start it again when I am older. Should I buy the Dark Materials Guide that is in book stores now?"
2,Interesting...in a bad way,"Mr. Pullman weaves a great story, and it is clear he is a brilliant writer.But the only way you could read these books and not find offense is that you don't believe in god. He specifically writes that the Christian/Jewish god is evil, and that is a bit of a disturbing message to be putting into a children's book. He intentionally frames himself as the anti-C.S. Lewis, who he considers ""evil.""The problem with this book is not that he criticizes the church, its that he specifically and directly criticizes god. I don' think that has any redeeming qualities, and isn't a healthy outlook no matter who you are or what you believe.Frankly, if you read these books carefully, its impossible to miss. So if you are an atheist, go for it, you'll probably really enjoy his tremendous skill. But if you believe in god, or your children do, find a book that has a more adjusted criticism of the church or one that is more friendly."
2,Average series,"The series was slow, difficult to get into and at times hard to follow. The overall story was good but each book individually can't be considered anything but an average read if you have nothing better to do."
5,Bought this as a gift,"I bought this as a gift, and it was easy to wrap and give. It's heavy, but that's okay. I really hope she likes it."
5,great series,"I have to laugh at the warnings on there that this series is anti-god. Sure, you could equate the bad guys with god and his followers, but so what? It was an alternate universe. It was interesting and thought provoking and I wept at the end. It's called fantasy for a reason."
2,"Uh, what happens? Where are pages 461-492 in Book 3?","OK, so my kid is reading the trilogy, and keeps insisting that I read it too. So I picked up the first book.Book 1 is GREAT. It ends in a cliffhanger.Book 2 is pretty good. It never resolves the cliffhanger, just makes the cliff higher and the hang-iness more suspenseful.Then comes Book 3 -- long, confusing, and MISSING THE CRITICAL PAGES THAT PRESUMABLY RESOLVE THE CLIFFHANGER FROM BOOKS 1 & 2.So I read over 1,000 pages and get ... no satisfaction..."
1,Seductive Satanism,"I wish I could give this zero stars. My daughter gave me this book to read. I started reading it and was instantly sucked in. It's very well written and the character is very likeable. Then I started reading reviews and interviews with the author, who says ""My book is about killing God"". The enemy in these books is God, the premise that in the war for Heaven the wrong side won....that God is a power hungry senile jerk....I will not finish this series. I think I'll go re-read the Narnia books now."
1,awful,I don't even know where to begin. Just keep your children away from these books. And FYI this is from someone who does not consider herself to be a religious fanatic. The author has a lot of hate and nastiness in him and it comes pouring out in his writing.
1,WARNING: This is not at all like Chronicles of Narnia,"This movie/book series is anti-Christ. If you're planning on your children reading these books or seeing the movie, it's against God and Christianity beliefs so if you're planning on your children to go ahead and read this and watch the movie, plan on discussing the issues."
1,Blah Blah Blah,"Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, did I mention blah? If I'd wanted to read Phillip Pullmans dumb musings about his perceptions on God and religion then I would have looked them up. I thought that I was buying a fantasy novel and was very disapointed when I found out it was just his little outlet for his mental constipation he was having. I am annoyed that Mr. Pullman managed to waste so much of my time. In addition, all pathetic athiest dogma aside, this is NOT a book for children. Even if it had no alterior motives, there is some sexuality and violence in these books that is not for kids. Nor adults for that matter. Anyway. Waste of time, waste of money."
4,Great Read,A great book to just sit and read. I have only finished the first book and am anticipating the movie.
4,Just finished the first book - great stuff!!,"Sad when it was over - I hope we get to spend more time with my favorite polar bear and female witch. I really enjoyed this book, especially Lyra, the ""wise beyond her years"" protagonist. Mr. Pullman was able to create a beautifully vivid world that was part Victorian, part ""Conan the Barbarian"" and part modern. Many memorable scenes. Can't wait to ready book two and see the movie in Dec!!!!"
3,A fair fantasy story,"The first book is wonderful and gripping. The second book feels like filler: just a bridge between acts. The third book is OK as a wrap-up, but it feels exactly like one.SPOILER ALERTFankly, I can't see what the religious furor is about. In particular, in the third book makes it very clear that the God being fought is not a/the creator. There are even examples of complex skill sets being imparted by ""grace"" of an undefined higher power. This is not an indictment of religion as much as it is of the inevitable corruption of churches.And it's pretty spot on on that one."
3,not real sure,i totally agree with people when they say about the religious ideas of this series. i mean i do have to give credit to the author this is really a spell bounding series even if i thought the ending was too sad. i'm 13 and felt offended by the aethesist ideas in this book so not everybody is ok with it. if that doesn't bother you than your really enjoy the series.
1,Bad writing ruins a book,"Why is so much fiction in print full of bad writing? At some point, plot, characters, and imagination cease to be important. The glaring fault of this book is the writing itself - dull, flat, colorless. Philip Pullman, like so many other big authors of today, has absolutely no grasp of the power and beauty of the English language. His style lacks flow, ease, and grace. My opinion? Skip this series. The story isn't worth the poor writing."
1,"Not a great read, certainly not for children","I did enjoy the first book of the trilogy but as I read the other books I bacame more and more upset that this series should be found in the children's section of a bookstore. Most fantasy books for children do not directly denounce, or promote a god found in modern religions. This series did and did so blatantly.For children from religions where there is a belief in a good and loving god, this series can be very troubling and frightening. I would not recommend this series to anyone under high-school age and even then I would be hesitant.I have seen this series compared to C.S. Lewis. As far a children's literature goes, His Dark Materials trilogy does not hold a candle to the Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe series.If you are looking for good children's fantasy literature, look elsewhere. This series is sure to trouble and disappoint young readers."
1,"Just plain hated it, through and through. And NOT for kids!!","SOOOO not for kids. There may be deeper meaning and all that, but children will read what is written: a story about kids' and parents' worst nightmares - children being kidnapped, tortured and murdered. This book is being compared to books that are read by kids in junior high or high school for its controversial undertones and even openly stated iconoclast ideas. Promote it for that audience and purpose, and I am OK with that. I don't care about the religious aspects, but don't want my child reading about castration in a ""children's"" book. I also didn't like the writing (sorry everyone) and the ending didn't follow through on the storyline. This book is OK to read along other philosophical works and would probably be great for such discussions about religion, life/death, politics, etc., but is not an outright fantasy as it has been publicized to be - on the surface it is just plain creepy. Blech!"
5,Philip Pullmnan -His Dark Materials,"These are the greatest fantasy, most scientifically valid materials to date in the area of M theory, on theology, and the psychology of growing up. This person has obviously studied and understood all that western Philosophy, Science, and History can offer. Philip Pullman deserves a salute from any reasonable, thoughtful, learned, and curious person on the planet. The cool shades go to you amigo.Martin"
5,Great Series!,"I loved how this series was combined into one book so when I finished one, I could easily continue right into the next book. One con was that is was a bit cumbersome to carry around with me, but I loved the story so much I didn't mind.I highly recommend this series! I have yet to find one that I have enjoyed more since."
3,Not 3 separate volumes,For those who order this thinking it it would be 3 separate volumes it isn't. All three stories are bound into one book.
1,Warning Keep Your Kids Away,DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE BOOKS!!! This man is a Athiest wanting to lead children away from God please do not support this man at all! This is a call to all christians to Boycot these books and the up and coming movie
1,blatant satanism,"the first novel is geared to draw you in, it is the icing on the cake, it look interesting, but the second novel reveal the purpose of the trilogy: the rebellion of the dark angels against God. Of course, God is the meany and the dark angels are the ""good guys"". Blatant satanism in other words. The author serves the father of lies and after reading him you feel unclean."
1,Anti-religion Brainwashing At It's Worst,"This strange series follows the journey of a new age Adam and Eve on a quest to kill God and destroy religion. Don't be fooled by the pretty package and the Hollywood film, this is a heavy dose of anti-religious propaganda aimed at young minds. I can't believe such themes could even be considered for a children's book."
1,His Dark Materials,"We are asked to rate this book. There is no option for a negative to the infinity.I think this triolgy should be retitled ""satan's instuction manuel"" These books are clearly the work of someone who is extremely EVIL. No matter how the reviews water down these books, the end results are evident. Pullman wants GOD dead in the eyes of children. I read the books with my eyes open and can't believe what he espouses. I am deeply saddened that Nicole Kidman has appeared in the movie since I heard that she is a devout Catholic. Parents please keep your children away from the movie and books, it can only bring harm.There IS NO REDEEMING FACTOR in any of the books."
2,second rate and hateful,"Don't start reading these books. They will leave a sour taste with their anti-God screed. I read this with an open mind, thinking that much of the controversy was going to be along the lines of people thinking that the Harry Potter series was anti-Christian. While the Golden Compass does not get into this tedentious anti-God philosophy, that grows through the rest of the book, poisoning what would otherwise have been a reasonable story. Nothing to compare to Harry Potter or Narnia or Tolkien -- clearly second rate. I have no objection to stories which involve church based conspiracy theories -- one need only read a biography of Galileo to expose some of the bad things done by the Church -- but this trilogy turns into a 2-D screed against the concept of God. This is a book I wish I had not bought or read, in retrospect."
2,you can buy better books.,"Don't start reading these books. They will leave a sour taste with their anti-God screed.

5,Radical and brilliant denunciation of religion ...,...disguised as a trilogy for children. The ideas here are challenging and profound. Read other reviews for praise of the characters and plots.
3,"A good start, but...","...it ends rather disappointedly. The first book was excellent, with a strong beginning, good characters and an exciting new world. It's a fun read for any adult who loves fantasy. However, the second and third books try too hard to do everything and end up being less than what they could have been. While it's interesting to see how the story wraps up, the second and third books were more obviously meant for children as opposed to a broader audience. The new characters introduced in the latter book are weak, and they end up taking away from the really strong characters developed from the first book. However, the religious/anti-religious ""message"" that has been protested by so many is subtle to the point that I really didn't notice it. I'd recommend this book for young teens or younger."
2,A bad finish,"This could have been one of the great fantasy novels. Despite a great start with The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, the third book is a failure. The plot winds everywhere. The fantasy world Pullman creates makes less and less sense, as characters in what appeared to be a Victorian age in the first books are suddenly dealing with references to ""atomic bombs."" Armies try to war against high tech weapons with gas filled zepplins. The ""solution"" to freeing the ghosts from the world of the dead is totally unsatisfying. The story just doesn't work, despite Pullman's tremendous imagination, beautiful writing style and flair for characterization.For those who feel as I do, I recommend novels such as James Stoddard's ""The High House,"" which hasn't received as much publicity, but is a far better read."
2,Poorly Written,"As an avid fan of young adult and mature fantasies, I was eager to read Philip Pullman's trilogy. I was very disappointed. Although he plainly has a creative mind, his presentation of his plot is difficult and annoying to read. His characters are suprisingly one-dimensional and hard to care about. Fans of the Harry Potter series would do better to look to up and coming authors like Garth Nix and Tamora Pierce, or to fantasy classics such as The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S. Lewis) and The Lord of the Rings (Tolkien). I would NOT reccomend these books to my friends, my parents, or the children I babysit."
2,"Beware, it's a little more than it seems.","The first two books were very written, spetacularly written in fact. The description and plot was incredible and the characters were likable. I finally got my hands on the third one, and I was very disappointed. He managed to tie up all the loose ends and the plot, but in my opinion it was a terrible way to end the book, and the whole idea that ""Christianity is nothing but a very powerful and convincing lie"" was very insulting to me."
2,BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD(s),"haha... well you should DEFINITLY get this book! the best fantasy fiction thriller i've ever read! best book i've ever read, for that matter... the characters, storyline, plot, everything is just perfect! (well i didn't like the end of the third book that much, but thats just my opinion... but get them anyway! lol"
2,Great Books But Print Is Too Small To Read,I am so annoyed. What are these book companies thinking? The print is way to small. How can anyone read these tiny print books? Is the book business so bad that they have to print smaller to save a few pages? How much can a page and a little extra ink cost? Twenty cents? I don't buy any books that are tiny print and returned them as soon as I opened it.Note to publishers: We'd buy a lot more books and read a lot more if we could actually read the words. 90% of all books are tiny type and I'm just not buying books or even attempting to read them when they're so tiny. I squinted through a few Agatha Christies but I can't take it anymore. My eyes hurt from squiting and I'm a young person too!
5,A Series To Be Remembered,"His dark materials is an ingenius fantasy of another worldin which Lyra hides in a meeting room and overhears a deviousplot in which a man called the Master wants to kill Lyra's uncleAsriel.And Lyra feels she must warn Asriel.This may sound like SpyKids where the kids are the heroes and lots of stupid unrealistic things happen but do not be decieved. This is a great story that deserves four and a half stars of recognition.the reason for this high rating is it has non-stop action, suspense, mystery,and what am i leaving out ... oh yeah everything else you would find in the perfect book.i can find no reason all or even half a reason why Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings are more popular it is also a mystery why i have not discovered this book sooner.Pullman is a unique author who to me is the best in his field since Mark Twain(who i highly recommend to anyone who can read)so please send your hate mail and death threats to VIXXER282 at yahoo.com"
2,The Anti-Narnia,"Please note what Charles McGrath writes to illuminate Pullman's trilogy in the Magazine section of the New York Times, November 13, 2005:[Lewis's greatest influence, though, is on the British fantasy writer Philip Pullman, whose ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy is both a homage of sorts (it begins with a girl in a wardrobe) and also a kind of anti-Narnia, a negation of everything Lewis stood for. God in these books turns out to be a senile impostor and Christianity merely a ""very powerful and convincing mistake.""Pullman is an atheist and, not coincidentally, one of Lewis's fiercest critics. He has said of the Narnia cycle that ""it is one of the most ugly and poisonous things I've ever read"" and has called Lewis a bigot and his fans ""unhinged.""]"
2,Parents Be Aware,"The series is well-written, creative, with engaging characters and some good value lessons such as loyalty and courage. However, underlying the series is a very negative slant on organized religion and a rejection of God. I would encourage parents to read the books before allowing their children to read them so they can decide if these messages are appropriate, and can discuss them with their children."
5,"""nothing to fear but fear itself""","LISTEN TO YOURSELVES!!!--warning people to shield their children from a book. What is your fear?.... Imagination? A book cannot cause harm...people can, and do so mostly out of ignorance. How can we stop ignorance?.....more children reading intelligent and imaginative books! Please stop your panic and banning, for it only shows your own lack of FAITH!"
5,What an incredible journey!,"I just finished this series, myself, and I have to say that this is one of the best series of books I have ever read! The depth of characters, the intricate plot, the twists and turns, and the emotional ties I experienced with this series was incredible. I can honestly say that when I finished the last chapter of the final book that I was sad to see it end. I still want more! And the final book really struck home with me, stirring me emotionally and making me think more about and appreciate the relationships I have with others.I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sci-fi/fantasy and has an open mind regarding religion and the universe. I really hope Pullman writes more on the characters in these epic books!"
5,A timeless masterpiece,"I have read this trilogy at least five times. Each time I find new pieces of the story that I did not notice the first time. An instant classic, these books are an amazing feat of literature. Pullman is a genius."
5,Incredible Books!,"These books are awesome, and all three must be read. The are definitely not children's books. They inspire, and even demand, a great deal of thought on the part of the reader. Most worth while."
3,The first book was the best.,"The first book was somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. The second book was sorry, maybe two or three stars. It was just a transition to get to the third book. The third book was just better than three stars. Harry Potter ended with a grand crescendo, a major event, the fight with Voldemort, that tied up all the pieces. This series tied up some of the pieces, but the bigger question of what the new order is was never broached. In book three Pullman was too spent too much time not so subtly taking jabs at the Catholic Church and Christianity by giving his story a biblical content instead of telling a good story."
2,Yikes,"Bought this after seeing the previews for the movie. I was looking for something to read at lunch and this sounded quite interesting. Too bad once i finished Golden Compass I had no desire to read Subtle Knife. Nothing really happens in the story to draw you in and make a connection with the characters. Everything that happens is either over explained or not explained at all. But the idea behind the story is interesting, so I won't say ""do not buy"". Some people obviously like Pullman's writing style, I am just not one of them."
1,"dull, dull","I slogged through the first two books and kept hoping for some more character development. By book three, I was worn out. I couldn't get beyond the first paragraph of book three. The writing is a perfect entry for one of those horrible writing contests; ""It was a dark and stormy night""... style."
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this set for my cousin for Christmas. He loves the books, but when he was about 20 pages into the first book, it skipped to page 100. All the pages are there, but they were not in order and some of them are bound upside down. He does love the books, but finding the pages has been somewhat challenging."
2,Very Original - Very Dull,"It was after the whole BBC's ""The Big Read"" that the Dark Materials trilogy came to my attension (it being in the top five finalistss). I saw the first book in a shop the week after and bought it, and eventually read all three novels.I must admitt that the way that Pullman adresses the ideas of religeon in this controversal way is fun to read. I also can't deny that Pullman has one of the greatest imaginative brains that I have come across in an author. But I found it quite dull really - it never reallly held me as well as much as most other books have."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"WOW! These have to be the best books I ever read, aside form Lord of the Rings. These books are way better than Harry Potter. They are much more origanl and will keep you on the edge of your seat with many questions. There are a lot of twists and turns as well. I know that I will read these books more than once. If you love Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or if you are just a Fantasy/Science-Fiction fan (like me), or even if you just like a good book now and then, then these books will leave you more than satisfied."
5,Simply Amazing,This trilogy is definitely one to read. All the books are very fast-paced and interesting.
5,his dark materials,"I enjoyed the entire harry potter series very much, but phillip pullman's his dark materials is even better!"
1,waste of time,"Read The Golden Compass and if you really like it, then read The Subtle Knife. But don't bother with The Amber Spyglass. It does not supply a satisfying conclusion to the series and doesn't hold together as a story, but hops from one character and universe to another with no apparent point to several of the plot lines."
2,Random Missions and Annoying Prophecy,"Not very good. Poor characterization, for one thing. Characters barely introduced suddenly become everyone's best friend and tears shed when they die.Pretty boring plot line, I kept hoping something would happen but it never did.If you are really bored, try it, you might feel better."
2,A Book for Fifth Graders?,"How could this be a book for fifth graders? I have worked with fifth graders and after reading this book, I would have to say that it is NOT for fifth graders. For instance, the book seems to attack authority and especially religion. It also suggests some homosexuality in the book and that it is fine, like a normal way of life, especailly between the two angels, Balthamos and Baurch. In the Bible, homosexuality is not welcomed and is considered a sin. Besides, would you want your child to be homosexual? Then, it suggests that Will and Lyra are more than friends and had a sexual relationship. But Will and Lyra are just children! Would you like your child to have a sexual relationship with another child? I know if I had a child, I would not. I think overall, that it is ok for a child to read this book as far as the fantasy is concerned, but with the issues I mentioned above, if I had a child, I would not let them read this book and I would find it a disgrace if they did."
2,"Not bad, but not great either","While the book definitely had some enjoyable elements, I didn't feel it was as ""epic"" or ""grand"" as it was built up to be. I felt the author does beat you over the head a little with his distaste for organized religion and a couple of the characters aren't consistently written through each of the books.It was enjoyable enough, but definitely not a ""desert island"" book."
4,Science or Religion?,"We read these books to learn for ourselves why they stirred up so much conflict. Never people to just accept what others are saying about the Church, or to believe everything that's taught, we are thinking and reasoning believers in God. These stories, while definately fiction, have great moral lessons. In the end, you're left to decide for yourself who's the good guy and who's the bad. And if you are like us in questioning those who expect unreasoning obedience, these will pique your intellect. These stories definately demonstrate that absolute power corrupts absolutely, even when ""they"" believe they're doing the right thing."
4,The Golden Compass,"I saw a trailer for a new movie called ""The Golden Compass"" and was intrigued. The movie is based on a book I had never heard of, so I tried to find it. I found out ""The Golden Compass"" is the first book of a trilogy called ""His Dark Materials."" I'm almost finished the first book and I love it; it's full of interesting situations and wonderful characters. You don't know who's trustworthy and who isn't. I recommend this story to all who are interested in good reading, especially fantasy."
4,Wonderful Story Telling and Vivid Characters!,"Phillip Pullman creates a wonderful story full of vivid characters. You easily fall for Lyra and the premise of the story and its parallel worlds is fascinating. He touches some serious questions and concepts; religion and social responsibility among them, while blurring lines between what we have been trained to see as good and evil in a way that you can easily follow. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt that the last installment, The Amber Spyglass may have been a bit rushed. Maybe I just didn't want it to end...? Overall I am thrilled that I finally found this series! One my favorite series!"
3,His Dark Materials,The story line is interesting but by the third book it becomes a little incoherant. We saw far too much of irritating characters and too little of intriguing ones. Much has been made of the anti Christian aspects of the story line. Even those while seeming to develop in The Golden Compass have deteriated to incomprehensibility by the third book The Amber Spyglass. For a childrens book series it is remarkably devoid of hope.
3,"Sorry, but the anti-Christian bias is real","I have been a SF fan for 40 years. I am an open-minded Christian who is not easily offended, but it is clear there is an agenda here. This is well above average young-adult SF but some of the most virulent anti-Christian propaganda I have ever read. Read it before introducing it to your kids. If you chose to, then read it with your older kids and discuss it with them. It may lead to some interesting discussions if they have reached the age to start questioning their faith. I hope that was the author's intent, but I think not."
2,Imaginative but flawed.,"This trilogy came highly recommended, so i dove right in. The first book caught me up in Lyra's world immediately, she is a great character. And ultimately, that's became my problem with these books. Some of the other characters are not as well drawn, especially Lyra's parents. I never felt her parents were completely believable parts of Lyra's story. They seemed to belong to some place other than Lyra's world, and maybe the writer should have left them there.Pullman has created a very special world(s), and for that i thank him for the introduction."
2,ShoeshineBoy,I thought this series was wonderful...until I got to the end and was so thoroughly disappointed I would not recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time. The first book was awesome. The second book was even better. The third was a chore getting through. The whole series was so original and inventive it was a great disappointment that he ended it on such a sappy love story. I didn't care at all in the end.
5,A thought provoking set,"Finally, a set of children's fantasy books that goes a bit against the grain and addresses serious issues that will cause children to think. If you want to brainwash your kids into following your imperfect footsteps, by all means boycott these books. If you want your children to learn, think, and make their own path by their own free will, these books are a great compass."
1,Sick and Disturbing,"This is a book that is being marketed to 8-12 year olds. While it is well written it is inappropriate for anyone under 16. Would you let your 9 year old read Stephen King's Salem Lot? If the answer is no, then don't let them read this. The book is about a girl investigating the disappearance of some friends. She discovers that her parents are involved in the kidnap, torture and murder of school age children."
1,RESEARCH this author and content of books,"Please be advised to research this author, his personal comments and beliefs before you have your children exposed to these books. Also beware of the movie based on the first book coming out in Dec. They have watered the content down, but the over all anti-christian/established religion message is still there."
2,Wanders and not meant for children,"These three books start out well, the writing is interesting and the characters well developed. Then it gets thicker, and as I read into the third book, I was sure these books are not something I would recommend for children at all. in fact the minimum age for these is probably the teen years. There is a lot of frankly anti-religious boilerplate going on here. Whole portions of the third book I felt were rants about religion and the authors personal take on it. Not any religion in particular. God is old, useless and has been supplanted by another being who has only the worst in mind, and this is the resolution. I would want my children to read something that won't capitulate them into the hopelessness that permeates the outlook here. There is so much excellent literature, ""Harry Potter"" included, that is so much fresher, better written and lacking venomous screeds."
3,Golden Compass,"I enjoyed the movie so I bought the book. Movie mostly true to the book. Enjoyed the added detail of the book. However, I was a bit disappointed in the trilogy as a whole. The characters are great!! Ideas for the compass and knife are great. But the plot doesn't quite fit in total. The actions of Lyra's parents are inconsistent especially at the end. Have no idea why the back cover says its a story about growing up."
1,Parents Beware,"First, let me say that fantasy is a favorite in my house, including Harry Potter, but after reading this, I will not be reading it to my children.Please be aware of what this book is really about before you let your children read it.The author, Phillip Pullman, is an avowed atheist who said himself in a 2003 interview in the The Sydney Morning Herald that ""My books are about killing God."" An ex-nun in the books describes Christianity as ""a very powerful and convincing mistake"", and another character says ""Every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.""If you believe there is a God, any God, then these books will thoroughly seek to undermine that belief in your children.If you do buy the book, PLEASE read it yourself before you give it to your child."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,"I hated this book so much. Yes it was well written and yes the ideas were good, but it offended me in many ways. Reallly the first book wasent nearly as bad the second and third, even though they where all just a tool for Mr. Pulllman's anti-god rant. This would have been a MUCH better book if wasent so anti-religous. I'm copletely fine with Mr. Pullman belifes, but you don't see me criticizing his belifes, so why is he criticizing christains! In september I will have a nice or nephew, I Will do all that's in my power to keep them from reading these books. This book will never darken my door step again and to my fellow christains, I hope it never darkens yours.P.S. this is to philip pullman: WHAT PART OF 'IF YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY THEN DON'T SAY IT ATALL' DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Anti Christian Book,"While the first book was very good and very well done. The second and third book are very anti Christian. The second and third book show fallen angels as the good side and God, the Christian religion as the bad side! The writer of the book does not belive in God. This is not the type a book I would want my child to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"What a waste. I agree that these books were well written but don't fool yourself - the subtle anti-God message gets stronger as the books progress! Again, I say, don't be fooled! If you let your kids read this junk you will be setting them up for spiritual failure...the more you find evil appealing, the more you accept it as normal. Don't do this to your kids or yourself! Stay away - run from evil!!!"
5,Read and find out for yourself...,"I know these books are intended for young readers, but I, at 29, found myself reading every chance I had. All the negative talk really had me wanting to see for myself what the books were REALLY about. I just finished reading them all and I have to say that I did enjoy them and was not offended by the books at all. I found them to be a great read and very imaginative. The movie detracts from the real content of the book, ""The Golden Compass"", but what movie is ever as good as the books anyway? I would recommend these books."
2,"Book"" His Dark Materials Trilogy",First book great....I think by the end of the second book I began being disappointed...the 3rd book ended pretty lousy. The central part regarding if there is nor is not a God is something to think about.
5,Great book!,"Love this book!Very easy to read, and very compelling for every age. It's a book for all the family not just for children!I had never read it before and i love it! I will read it to my nephews. Very recommended reading!!"
3,Nice Book,The first book is definitely great reading. But the trilogy does get rather long towards the end.
3,"Overall, not bad, but not great","The story kept me intrigued, as many do, but the overall effect didn't wow me. Oh, the whole series is worth the reading, if you've already gone through some of the better ones out there.I even liked newcomer Brian S. Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage better. It has wars, magic, secret passages all the while a solid story line keeps it flowing smoothly and logically. If you like epic fantasy try this one. It's a bit rough it being his frist ever novel, but well worth the read."
5,Great Books. Very Pleased.,I am very pleased with my order. The books were in excellent condition and were swiftly delivered.Thanks!
5,A once in a lifetime journey,"In the trilogy of His Dark Materials Pullman guides readers through a fantastic and thrilling epic adventure. The Golden Compass is the most innocent of the three books, whereas the second, and especially third book, take on a more mature status. These are books that never lose their touch, no matter how many times you read them. A rollercoaster of emotions lends feeling, and all the characters have amazing depth. Though these books may not be for the die hard christian, they should be read with an open heart and mind. They will have you wishing you had a daemon too.(a personification of the soul in the form of an animal) If you are anything like me, you won't be able to put them down."
5,Harry Potter eat your heart out!,"After demolishing the Harry Potter series, i was left empty and longing for the fifth book. I was given the Pullman trilogy by a friend to help me combat my ""Potter Blues"", and i was impressed!Imagery that was exquisite with a story line to die for, and a new view on the way things could be... for all we know! very brave of Pullman to write a tirlogy such as this and direct it at the younger age group. This is on par with, if not better than, the likes of Narnia, Dickens, Rowling, Robert Lewis Stevenson etc. This is story for all ages and a real eye opener. Mr Pullman... MORE PLEASE"
1,"Starts strong, ends disappointingly weak","After the first book I was enthralled and couldn't wait to read the rest. The second book isn't great, but the middle book of a trilogy never is. The third book, however, made me so angry at the time I wasted reading the others. It was not some ""anti-religious"" aspect that made me angry- it was poor writing, creating a whole useless world in the last book and then making the major conflict resolution at the end weak and pointless. The ""anti-religious"" controversy was probably trumped up to boost sales; it barely figures into the meandering conclusion. So upset, so upset was I that I wasted all that time reading this series."
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be,"I am a big, long time fan of fantasy literature, particularly that written for young adults. Based on the reviews of this trilogy, I was expecting, and hoping, to find a really enthralling work that would measure up to The Dark is Rising and the Harry Potter books. I was disappointed. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found Pullman's writing style a bit forced and contrived. It took me quite a while to feel engaged with the characters, and I don't think I ever really felt sympathy with Lyra, the main character.I didn't find the existential premise troubling, in fact, I think it was the most original and best part of the book. The multiple worlds premise was interesting, but I didn't find the alternate worlds all that believable.In the end, I would say that the books were entertaining, but probably would not read them again. To those considering these books, I would recommend books by Susan Cooper or Lloyd Alexander instead."
2,Engrossing - but Christian heresy,"The Golden Compass was absolutely scintillating. The guy's a great writer. However, in the Amber Spyglass, the truth comes out. Yahweh (Jehovah, God Almighty), is just one of a pantheon of sencient dark materials in a strictly material creation.I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy. But not one that assaults my Christianity. The comparisons to Tolkien and Lewis are not deserved.This is a childrens series?If I were an athiest, I'd undoubtedly love this series. However, I'm not, and the unfinished trilogy went out in today's garbage."
4,Great but pushy,"These books were well written and fascinating, but they push the comfort zones of those with strong spiritual connections. The first one is wonderful, but the second and third delve deeply into atheism and the philosophy of the author. I would highly recommend that you read at least Golden Compass, and beyond if you enjoy an intellectual battle with yourself. (By the way, the four-star rating is an average: GC is 5, SK is 4, and AS is 3)."
1,Great start to the trilogy but poor finish,"I won't place any spoilers here but I was greatly disappointed by the trilogy. While I found ""The Golden Compass"" endearing and intriguing, I was let down by ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""The Amber Spyglass."" Especially ""The Amber Spyglass."" I felt like Pullman was neglecting the story in order to put forth his own religous and political views. Many times the characters and/or story is contrived in order to further Pullman's agenda. I also was disappointed in the many issues left unresolved. It's unfortunate because it's an interesting premise and the characters (especially initially) are well drawn and captivating. I found myself really caring about them."
2,Less than the sum of its parts,"I was intrigued by His Dark Materials, which I'd heard touted as something of an anti-Narnia. Packed with talking animal companions, witches, armored polar bears, ghosts, shamans, soul-sucking spectres, zeppelins and hot air balloons, angels, cliff-ghasts, harpies, miniature dragonfly-riding warriors, magic spells, weird science, literary references, alternate timelines, malevolent conspiracies, intrigue, ancient emnities, multiverse-spanning wars, and a knife that can cut between worlds, His Dark Materials has all the trappings of an allegorical sci-fi/fantasy epic, with one crucial, conspicuous exception: It is almost utterly devoid of charm. I prefer Narnia."
2,unconvincing,"This trilogy starts off very well. The problem is the completely unconvincing ending. For one thing, the most interesting character suddenly has a change of heart with little motivation. For another, it turns out the grand prophecy that runs throughout the trilogy has a really lame and uncompelling manifestation. If you feel you must read this to see what the fuss is about, get it from the library because you won't want to read it more than once."
2,Publish British editin,"I believe in Pullman, not his publishers. Good Books. Great ideas. Should have had the courage to publish the British edition, not a dumbed down American edition."
2,Depressing,"These look like children's books, but I'd burn it before I'd let a child read it. Well told ...but where Harry Potter teachs about loyalty and bravery, here the message is that your mother may be a murderer, and you'd better not trust anyone.... Sad."
3,"not about Religion, though it claims it is","Pullman's thesis, that bad things are done in the name of religion, is harmless enough, but as Jewish person I can't help but feel completely annoyed that apparently some kind of High Anglican/Catholic theology is the only religion that exists for P. Sophomoric logic and an oversimplified approach-- yes the book asks difficult questions, but so does Ayn rand. If you like propaganda disguised as fiction, you'll love these.That said, books 1 & 2 are very exciting stories, with some wonderful characters in them. It's only in Book 3 that the preachiness becomes heavy-handed, boring, and near-sighted. For some of us, the pros/cons of historical Christianity are, believe it or not, irrelevant."
3,Young readers beware,"Though the characters are captivating, and the world Pullman creates is vivid and rich, this series of books is NOT for readers under 15. Parents should be prepared to read the books with their children and engage in fairly complicated discussions about parental violence, the nature of God, and even budding sexual feelings."
1,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy and quickly began reading the rest. Sadly, things went from bad to worse. I truly wish Pullman had not allowed his ""soapbox"" to cloud his literary creativity."
1,I was disappointed...,"The first book in this series was very well written and engaging. However the second book, seemed to muddle the difference between good vs. evil, and left me feeling disappointed and uneasy. I was unable to complete the third book. It became clear that Mr. Pullman was expressing extremely anti-religious beliefs. The book simply contained too much blasphemy for me to continue. This book is definitly not appropriate for children. If you are a Christian parent looking for good science fiction/fantasy books for your child, stick w/ Narnia or Harry Potter. Both of these series draw a definite line btwn good & evil and the hero is on the side of good."
3,"Starts good, goes down hill...","Although the first two books were quite good, I had trouble finishing the third, as it just seemed anti climactic and kind of poorly put together. I particularly found Ms. Coulter to be unbelievable (ok, she's a liar, but...) towards the end, and the elephant things were a bit weird, but ok... Also, I'm not a particularly religious person, but the none-too-subtle Christians suck message was starting to wear on me a bit by then. There where a few times where it just seems as if the characters stop to preach about it when it really wasn't relevant to the story. It just got old after a bit and at points it was a distraction from what I thought was a pretty good story up until the end, not the masterpiece I've heard some people call it, but decent fantasy."
4,A great read,"A nicely wrought story and very likeable characters. Might be a bit dark for young children, but very suitable for teenagers."
5,"great, epic fantasy","Just read it.Beautifully written, beautifully imagined, fiercely intelligent but lacking nothing of the kind of emotion that can move an adult to tears. (Well, damp eyes.)Read it for the Panzerbjorn, if nothing else. ;)"
2,EVIL BOOKS,"Had the author not stupidly used the term DEMON for the people's animals, he would not have lost the massive audience his books otherwise might have gotten him. I myself refused to see the movie because of this satanic crud, and I will not let my children see it or read the books. The worst mistake a fantasy author can make is to insult millions of people by using terms from real-world faiths."
1,Narnia preferable,"Phillip Pullman has unfortunately expressed a bias against the Christianity of Lewis' Narnia works, believing the Christian message is somehow inferior and bigoted, compared presumably with his works. Pullman's efforts lack the depth of meaning found within the Narnia works deprived of such resplendent base, leading to unfortunate ramblings without similar quality of meaning. Less inspired than Narnia, that lack in the Pullman works leaves them unfortunately wanting."
4,Phillip Pullman - Dark Materials Trilogy,I had read this trilogy over Christmas last year and really liked it. I bought it for a friend's daughter who just turned 14 as a birthday present - something to read during the summer. The condition of the books was really good and it was shipped to me on time too. All in all very satisfied with the purchase.
3,His Dark Materials -- A classic?,"Pullman's fantasy trilogy ""His Dark Materials"" is an entertaining, original work which is worth reading. However, it appears that all the marketing stops have pulled out in order to make this work a manufactured classic. Comparisons to ""The Lord of the Rings"" etc. have been trotted out, and a fancy trade three-volume set is available for the Christmas market.Enough already! These books are well-written and fun; worth the price of admission. Classics, however, they are not. Time may prove me wrong, but I don't think publishers can manufacture greatness (pace boy bands). To readers: buy them and enjoy them. To the publishers: settle down!Casey Coleman, Ed.D."
2,Excellent Book 1 and 2 and bad Book 3,"Book 1 and 2 are very good read but the writer loses focus and his confidence by the time he reaches the 3rd. A timid end and a climax that takes place long before you reach the last page. Most seriously he is not able to maintain his reader's suspension of disbelief - which I think is a major infraction on the writer's ability particularly those who're treading on this genre. The only character(s) that stands out and in fact leaps from the pages of the book is Mrs. Coulter and her daemon the Golden Monkey. The heroine Lyra pales in comparison to her Mommy and her daemon.But overall, this series cannot be missed; you can't do without it if you are a fan of this genre."
4,I think it's Wonderful.,This series of books I have found to be very engaging and well written. I am halfway into the final book and I am very glad I purchased the collection.
4,The Golden Compass,"I just finished The Golden Compass, which is book 1 of the trilogy His Dark Materials,by Philip Pullman. It is very intriguing, quick reading.If you liked the format of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this one, in search of Dust, although it is not as deep or long.Great reading for a rainy evening."
4,"Bias? Heck, it's just a good read!","Sorry people, I don't buy it. Pullman has written an engaging series, full of intrigue, sci-fi, fantasy, suspense heroics, love and anger. Hate? Nope... it's just a good read, pure and simple. Why do we always have to dig down into a book for its hidden meaning, or a hidden agenda? Isn't it possible... just possible?... that an author simply wrote down a good story and made it into a book? Just my humble opinion, having been an avid reader of fantasy and sci-fi for almost 40 years. This is a simple story about good vs evil, like most other books it has its hero's, heroine's and evil mongers. I believe this is a bit complicated for a juvenile, but certainly nothing offensive. It's in the Harry Potter mode, but darker (as suggested by another reviewer), and perhaps more somber. Still, I would recommend it as a good read."
1,They call this entertainment?,"I did NOT like this book at all!! There was nothing lower than a ""1"", so that's what I gave it. If I wanted to be preached at for most of the series, I would have read the Bible. Although it did have some SciFi elements, it was overall a religious book. It was also confusing. I STILL don't know what the heck is Dust. Seriously, this book is B.O.R.I.N.G.!! Well, that's my opion anyway.... >_>"
1,Pullman is an atheist with an agenda,"I bought this before I realized that the author had publicly stated that the goal of his books is to teach children that there is no God. I think it is awful to bury a message like that in a children's book. Parents should be aware that he describes these books as being about ""killing God."" If you don't believe me, Google it. I didn't believe it at first either."
5,the golden compass,This book is the BEST book I've ever read. It is written well and is a fabulous story.
3,I just grew up...,"I'll make a very short review about my experience with this series. I must have been 14 when I read the first book, and I was really impressed. This is a really good book for young adults, and so the older folks' negative reviews are simply written by people who are too old and who think too critically and realistically to enjoy the book. Sadly, however, at one point in time I also got ""too old"" to enjoy the rest of the series, because the installments took forever to arrive. I was 16 when the second book came out and for a long while after the 3rd book wasn't published. So, you can imagine that once I was 18, children's fantasy wasn't really my genre anymore."
3,mass market paperbacks - not trade paperbacks,"I ordered this under the impression that these were trade paperbacks, not mass market paperbacks. (In the list of similar items, this set is listed separately from the specific ""mass market paperback boxset"".)I guess I didn't pay close enough attention, because indeed these are mass market paperbacks. (If you take the time to look over the full listings for His Dark Materials, you can see that the covers are the same as the individual mass market volumes.)It's a fairly nice set, for mass market, and a good value -- just not what I was expecting. If you want to buy the series as separate volumes and on the cheap, it's a good choice."
3,Enjoyable,"I liked reading the dark materials. The only mistake I made was to read the last book before the others. I read that the ""Amber Spyglass"" was the one to read and enjoy. However, I would've enjoyed it more had I read the other two books that came before."
4,Good - Not Children's Fare,"This was a good tale in the tradition of LOR and Narnia. The language and themes are advanced, children won't likely be able to follow easily. The risky stuff really doesn't appear too fully until Book 2. I've recommended to adult friends who are comfortable using their God-given imagination."
3,Check out the hype,"I had to see what the hype was all about and after reading all three I get it. In my opinion, these are not for kids, but still a good read. Leaves you thinking."
3,Pullman's Dark Materials,"After having heard about a movie is coming up about ""The Golden Compass"" I'd liked to read the book(s) first. Not having seen the picture yet, I prefer the first part of the trilogy. Pullman wrote a fascinating and enthralling progression so I was quite excited to get to the second part of the story. It started exactly as I mentioned but after the first half the novel got long drawn out. Even so starts the third part ""The Amber Spyglass"" where in my opinion the story is overthrown in the respect of too much sense of wonder describing for example the diamond-legged ""people"". All'n'all I would recommend this trilogy for readers who like fantasy, thrill and unobvious solutions until the end of the story. Therefore I would recommend ""His Dark Materials"" for long winter-eves."
1,Spoiled a good story,Pullman spoiled a good fantasy story by incorporating his well documented hatred of Jesus & Christianity.
1,Wildly over-rated,"If the Harry Potter series can be described as ""Lord of the Rings"" light, this series would have to be described as ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" light. The protagonists stumble from one improbable escape from danger to another. The supposed philosophy for challenging authority is missing most of the time and is badly developed and half-baked when it is developed. Don't waste your time."
1,If you're a christian,"If you're a Christian, then it is quite likely that this book will offend you. I myself am a Christian and bought the omnibus of this series not knowing what it was about. *SPOILER ALERT* it's about trying to kill GOD, get this, GOD with a knife. Not only is this blasphemous and offensive but it's the entire premise is ludicrous. I do not throw away literature by virtue for the most part, and I mean hardly ever, but I threw this book away. This is not the sort of thing a child should be reading. Now if you're a die hard atheist/agnostic on the other hand, you'll likely think it's the best book ever published."
1,Horrible,Not worth the time and there are abundant classics at the library your child could read (swiss family robinson etc).
4,"It's just a book, people...","With all the hype over Philip Pullman's ""atheism,"" I think it is important to note that his beef seems less with (the possibility) of a Supreme Being, than with organized religions themselves--all of which are very human, run by humans, and thus flawed. People turn to religion to help them organize their view of the world and their place in it. Any student of history can point to many examples of human beings doing evil in the name of their religion. Unfortunately, it often seems that organized religion is more concerned with weeding out those who question their view of the world, and little to do with any worship of a Supreme Being--and this dichotomy seems to be what disturbs Pullman. No faith should be shaken by questions and doubts, but should be strengthened and stretched by the constant curious questioning of the evolving human race."
3,I dont get all the 5 star reviews,"I think this book should have been named Kay and O'neil. It focused more on O'neil and his sister than his wife. Wondering who wrote all these reviews. I did catch myself skipping a some of the blah blah to get to the point. But I must say.. I did not regret reading it, and I did not have to force myself to finish it. It was a good easy read, not too complex."
3,Easy Read.,"A story about ordinary people and their lives, loves and losses. The stories were linked together to make up a loose plot but it was beautifully written. If you are into stories told in prose, this might be the book for you. However, if you are looking for an exciting plot I think you might be disappointed. A nice easy read."
4,Good Character Development,"The characters are wonderfully developed and their lives intertwined over time. I felt like there were a few loose ends that I had to fill in myself, but overall, I enjoyed it very much."
5,Elegant,"Justin Cronin understands human emotion about as well as it can be understood, and he has an uncanny way of reducing it to its essence. How can such a small book span the emotional life of two generations with such impact? He is a word master of the highest degree.Other reviews have told the details; they are all true, but one must read Mary and O'Neil to understand the talent of the author."
4,"Charming, Couldn't put it down.","Cronin, while fairly new to me is quickly becoming one of my Favorite writers.Mary and O'neil, is a fast read, Enjoyably Charming and touched my imagination, kept me interested. Just what I'm looking for in my escapes from my reality. l.o.l"
5,Do Not Finish This Book in a Doctor's Office!!!,"While waiting for the release of ""The Passage"" I decided to download Justin Cronin's ""Mary and O'Neil"" and ""The Summer Guest."" I have just finished the former and consider it one of the finest novels of loss and longing ever written.Perhaps we are meant to read certain novels at certain periods in our lives and for anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one this novel will resonate to the very core of their being. I read the book in two days and was transported to another world. I know Mr. Cronin's next two novels will not disappoint.I finished this book while waiting for a doctor's appointment and people in the waiting room began to glance at me while tears were falling on my Kindle - No tear-soaked pages anymore, I'm afraid. Being a Houstonian with ties to Rice University but never having heard of Mr. Cronin before all the hype on ""The Passage"" began, I am so happy that he is receiving so many well-deserved accolades."
5,Mina proves she is the greatest.,This is a must for any music fan. Almost all of Mina's best is here. Put all the discs in your CD changer and enjoy hours of the fabulous diva.
5,A beautiful book that inspires.,"The Business of Bliss is a beautiful book that really inspires women to search their hearts when looking for the perfect business. It encourages us to use our talents and our creativity through examples of other women who have done just that! I had barely picked it up when I was grabbing a notebook to jot down ideas for my own business. I enjoyed the photography, the personal elements of the women and their businesses as well as the resources and business tips that were included."
2,"All Style, No Substance","A pretty picture book, with very little in the way of actual business advice. Pleasant for perusing, but if you're looking for an actual ""how to"" book, look elsewhere."
5,"Inspirational book, a must for all of us!","All of these women are truely inspirational. I particularly found retired Air Force officer Debby Dubay awesome. Turning her passion into her second career and passion, she established Limoges Antiques Shop, which has been successful for the last decade. Now she has completed a series of books for the Limoges procelain collector; Living With Limoges, Antique Limoges at Home and Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain Boxes to Vases. I enjoy supporting a woman of this caliber."
3,Inspirational but not Informative,"I bought this book for the very reason that I was hoping to find the basics on how to start a business. This book, though well photographed and artistically designed, did not have the business 101 I was looking for to help me get started. There was not enough text either for me to absorb the business processes of each woman featured.If you want a book that is pure inspiration, then this book satisfies one's yearning to venture into having a business of your own. If you want a more technical or business basics book as to how to get started, then this book is not for you."
3,A little too much biology,"A little too much mechanism and not enough technic. Very informative, if you're a biology major, but doesn't really tell you enought about how to sing. He gets into every conceiveable muscle and ligament in the mechanism - after awhile you can't keep track of it all. Having said all that, I do recommend it, because it does give you a great foundation in how the voice works; you just have to wade through it. It just wasn't what I was looking for, but I found it useful and sometimes fascinating. I just don't think a singer or teacher needs to know quite this much bio, but it's good to know some of it."
4,Fantastic resourch!,"This is an amazing resource on the science of singing. I've read many books on singing and they all seem to draw on this book for a lot of their information. It is a little wordy, however, and outdated as it refers to the reader, the student, the teacher, and any human as ""he."" I feel that the publisher should make another additon to remove this language and update the photos and it would be much better. This book reads a bit like a text book but it will teach you most of what you need to know to sing properly - I defnitely recommend it!"
2,Sounds bad,"Of course how good an instruments sounds is subjective, but I found this drum sounds bad. The tone is sort of a high pitched 'bluaang bluanng' and the tone occuring after the beater hits sounds similar to the sound of a basketball after it bounces up from the court. Maybe this drum is supposed to sound this way, it is my first shaman drum, but even so, I get no enjoyment or other benefit from the sound of this drum. It has an airish high tone to it, not anything like a more deeper strong tone. I own other drums (Udu, Bongos, Tabla, Djembe) and I like those, it's just this one I don't like. My advice is spend a little extra to a buy a 16"" or 22"" Remo buffalo drum, which by the way, I dont own that so I have not tried it, but a bigger drum will have a deeper tone I would find more appealing for the shaman drum sound."
5,Early Split Enz....................,"This is definitely one of Tims best solo records, very melodic and catchy. It deff has a early SPLIT ENZ feel for all you old time fans. No it's not Split Enz but it has that ""six months in a leaky boat feel"". If you're a fan of his work from BEFORE AND AFTER and previous? get this record you'll be glad you did...."
5,Imaginary Kingdom - Tim Finn,"Forget about liking Crowded House, Brother Neil, The Beatles or anything else people need to hear when asking how a new Tim Finn album is, Imaginary Kingdom is a great album because of great songwriting, catchy hooks, slick production and raw emotion. Every song on this album has been rattling around my head since I got it and that's pretty rare lately when it comes to my favorite recording artists who are still around from the 60's, 70's and 80's (e.g. Elvis's Momofuku). If you like good melodies, lyrical imagery, vocals with feeling and and just a great overall feeling from an album, check out Imaginary Kingdom"
4,Might as Well Be the Moon,"Tim Finn's ""Imaginary Kingdom"" is a bright pop record. The opener ""Couldn't Be Done"" is a catchy Kinks-like tune with a breezy McCartney-like bridge. The second track ""Still the Song"" pumps joyfully, ""On a Sunday afternoon, the middle of town might as well be the moon."" ""Salt to the Sea"" is a requiem for a departed soul with Finn's voice high-pitched, almost breaking, ""Our tears will merge with the flowing water carrying salt to the sea."" ""Horizon"" is a restless love song with a haunting melody, ""Something pure. It's hard to find when you're so far from sure."" ""Show Yourself"" rolls with sweet swells of melody washing in like waves, ""I need you to inspire me; I can't get it from anyone else."" ""So Precious"" bounces with a driving guitar riff, ""It's raining snakes from the sky; It's blowing ghosts through the trees."" ""Imaginary Kingdom"" is a great set from one of Australia's best singer-songwriters. Enjoy!"
1,"Incredibly slow, clunky interface, horrible company","The program is decent in terms of features, but it's very slow once you get past the initial screen. It seems like the program was designed in the 80's and updated with duct tape and rubber bands to get the current version.I recently tried to reach the management of the company because it seems they dropped their personal finance product. I wanted to make sure that MyBooks (and the entire company, for that matter) will still exist in a year.There is nothing worse than investing time and money into learning a program only to find that it is no longer supported. After almost five days I still have not heard from anyone in Appgen, and that has me a bit worried."
1,So bad it made me Angry!,"If you're one of the few people on the planet Earth that actually liked the first Jack Frost for what it is then you'll hate this inferior, PAINFULLY unfunny sequel. Jack Frost 2 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your time or your money. Imagine if the creators of Full House tried to make a horror movie on a budget of 500 dollars. This is important too: if you're the kind of person who gets angry when you watch really atrocious movies then avoid Jack Frost 2 because it is one of the most incompetent films I've ever personally witnessed."
3,Funny,"Like the first, there is a lot of fun and this movie and great gore.Not a great movie but fun to watch."
1,DASHED HOPES,"Expecting a worthy sequel of such a cinematic tour de force as Jack Frost 1, I was horribly disappointed with this creation. We, the viewers, hardly get to see Jack in action and when we do, he manifests himself as a poorly-done computer-generated snowman. I must admit, the paper mache costume in Jack Frost was infinitely better than this digital creation. I also wasn't a fan of the medium used in the filming of Jack Frost 2. Whereas Jack Frost 1 used real film as a medium, the use of video cameras in the sequel gave more of a feel of a soap opera than a horror movie. I also missed Jack's sharp-tongued one-liners that were so wonderfully prevalent in the first movie. All in all, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer snowman was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I have seen. It had such potential. My advice, immediately buy the original Jack Frost and pray that if there is a 3rd edition to the Jack Frost series, it will stay true to the form of the original."
1,It dosen't get much worse than this,"I can honestly say that Jack Frost 2 was perhaps the worst b movie ever made, and that's saying something. I can't even believe that this movie got a theatrical release. If, however, you enjoy seeing small snowballs with fangs go on killling sprees, than it's not all that bad. I couldn't believe this was an actual movie, it looked like it was filmed with a camcorder or something. I especially enjoyed the snowman exploding in to a strange, foam like substance and the hilarious rubber K-Mart severed body parts. I give this film 1 star if you aren't watching this without the assistance of mind altering drugs, but if you are, than it's 5 stars! Watching it was interesting, actually, considering it dosen't get very cold in Africa. Stay cool, and although you may have to tie yourself to a chair to finish this movie, believe that it will be a mind-altering experience, and you will never be the same!"
3,Great movie.,"I rented this movie on Thursday for three bucks, and it was very well worth the price. It's a great movie to watch during the holidays, or even Christmas. If you're a fan of the original, such as myself, then you'll certainly have HELLAFUN watching this flick. A note to writer/director Michael Cooney: I sure hope you make a part 3 *very* soon."
1,one of the worst ever,"this is one of the 5 worst movies i've ever seen, if not the worst. and i've seen some bad ones. it's right up there with Carnosaur, Jack-O, and Uncle Sam. but at least those had a couple moments of laughter. this is just stupid throughout. i love watching bad movies, if they're funny. but i almost couldn't make it through this. the first is much funnier, although still admittedly terrible-there's a touch of seriousness that makes it more humorous. plus the last 20 minutes are really funny. but this one isn't worth renting. it's awful, just awful. zero stars"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"Okay I kind of liked the first one, but when I saw this one I was completly shocked!! The camera angles were soooo poor and the acting couldn't get any worse! The special effects sucked, I have seen better ones on cartoons..... and for any of you that have seen MTV's Undressed the acting was just about the same if not worse! The snowman looked soooo fake and the ice cubes talking what the heck was that?? And as for those snowballs getting puked out, that was lame. I would have to say for anyone who likes to waste their precious time, watch this, but for anyone who likes good movies, don't think once about renting this, don't even touch it!!!!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN,"i loved the first Jack Frost movie,but the sequel was just horrible.i was looking at my local video store,and i was very surprised to see that Jack Frost 2 came out on video.i couldn't wait to get home and watch this movie.when i got home and started watching it,i was really dissapointed.the special effects looked so stupid,i've seen better effects on tv commercials.i mean i know it's only a movie,but how the hell does Jack Frost swim in the ocean,and stay alive in the carribean.i know i'm not a rocket scientist,but doesn't snow usually melt in the heat?it just went for too many laughs,i just think it should've been more of a horror movie,and not a comedy.if you liked the first movie,i suggest you go rent that one.because you will be upset you spent the money to rent this awful movie."
3,Jack frost 2,"It's not going to win an academy award but it is ""goofy"" funny. I rented it for my 9 year old son and he loved it."
1,Absolutely not.,"I liked the first one; It was kind of funny and dumb. We drank all this Pabst Blue Ribbon on a cold December night and laughed pretty hard at it. So when this second one came out, me and the wife got all excited and prepared ourselves for maximum laughs. Sadly, the maximum laughs were not to be. This movie was so dumb that it was boring. About 45 minutes before it ended we were sitting completely silent on the couch, not laughing, not scared, not stimulated, not happy. Just pondering which one of us had enough energy to get up and push the stop button. If you want to achieve the same level of maximum laughs as you did during the original Jack Frost, I would just recommend renting the first one again. Renting this garbage sequel will only encourage them to make a 3rd one..."
1,Disapointing sequel is nowhere near as fun as the first.,"I must say how disapointed I was when I saw JACK FROST 2. I had high hopes since it was made by the same team who brought us the first, but JACK FROST 2 has nothing to offer but annoying characters, a plot that, even for a stupid movie, feels like it's going nowhere and telling us nothing. What made the first one so good was the sense of fun and cheapness, yet at the same time it had a dark tone to it. JACK FROST 2 is so painfully bad that it's NOT good. Further more, we barely see Jack himself and are instead given stupid killer snowballs which are not at all exciting. Stick to the first JACK FROST."
5,A worthy sequel to an awesome movie,"Jack Frost 1 was awesome...it was funny, suspenseful, and just plain silly enough to enjoy. The sequel goes one step farther than that and ups the ante on everything that made the first movie successful. The extremely low budget hinders little and I think this is the movie the director set out to make. The DVD includes a very informative and humorous director's commentary and a few other interesting features. Highly recommended!"
2,Not worth viewing,"I loved the first 'Jack Frost'. However, the sequal is not worth seeing unless you can see it on cable and every other channel on your television is blocked out and your DVD and VCR players are both broke."
2,actually 2 and a 1/2,"I have just recently seen this film and this what all I really have to say about it. 1. the acting was pretty horrible.2. how the hell did the killer snowman get to the tropical waters and why did he go there.3.the death scenes are soo stupid. I mean they didn't show how the first victim died and how that girl with the red shirt die?. Out of all this I seemed to have liked it a little,but really people this movie looks like a made for tv movie.I have one more put down for this film though. Its so bad that the front picture of the coverbox is at times better than the film itself."
4,Beyond Ouspensky...,"The reviews which I have read of this book on the internet so far are sadly missing the main point which Dorothy Phillpotts makes. Though speaking about self remembering and self observation as very important, when she relates how J. G. Bennett, her teacher at the time, came back from Paris after meeting Gurdjieff there, whom they had thought was dead, but was not, Bennett explained that what he had learned from Gurdjieff was a new way of working on oneself involving having a different relationship with one's body.This is not explained in detail in the book, but followers of Gurdjieff know what it is, and how important it is. This new approach made it possible to remember oneself and observe much longer than any of them had been able to do under Ouspensky or Bennett. Unfortunately for him, Ouspemsky had parted company with Gurdjieff before he understood this different approach."
1,Cheap Plastic,Cheap plastic not worth $11.I returned after opening and realizing that it wasn't metal.
2,Lacks depth,"If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues.For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most ""Do what you love"" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick apart other chapters in the same manner."
5,On the mark,"I have spent a lot of time considering the subjects that Ken Dychtwald so appropriately summarizes in his new book. I have spent my career in the financial services industry. I find his conclusions and advice to be on the mark.If you are concerned about or interested in the aging process (how it impacts your own life, your investments and your family) as well as the paradigm shifts that have occurred from times when wealth, longevity and health were significantly different) this book should be of significant assistance. In addition, the book is written in an easy to read, conversational style."
3,The Power Years,"I thought his book provided good tips and was an easy read. I was a little disappointed with the section on financial management, and I thought he spent to much time on trying to inspiring the baby boomers to step up their volunterism, rather then show they way, he's trying to motivate a generation and that's not really the purpose of the rest of the book."
1,Wrong direction for the rest of your life,"This guy is totally out of touch with reality. He is trying to rewrite reality so that the we give HIM power through the money he hopes we will spend on his book. Don't make the mistake of buying this book and don't make the huge mistake of following what he writes. There is no need for power in life. Especially at our ages. We need peace and happiness. We can get this by a walk in the woods. Don't loose the rest of your life by running after happiness where it is not. Happiness is inside yourself, try to find it before looking elsewhere. It will not come from anywhere or anybody else. Get peace with yourself instead of creating chaos.All chapters are poorly written with bad advices."
1,What a disappointment!,"Totally agree with earlier reviewer -- a waste of $. A general mish-mash, all-around guide trying to cover both ends of the age spectrum with too much generality and rah-rah for what we already know. Not one to keep as a reference.So sorry to see one of my favorite no-nonsense financial columnists, Jane Bryant Quinn, touting this book on the flap. Her credibility slipped a notch."
1,good for only the most clueless,"Good Lord, people must be busier than I thought. If you haven't been allowed to even think about your future after retirement, then maybe you will get something out of this book. For the rest of us, this is drivel."
5,Eye Opener,"I never knew there was so much to life after 40. Dan Kadlec's genius writing made me realize that my life is no longer ending, but just beginning!!! I no longer dread being ""over the hill"", I recommend this book to all!!!"
3,"Not bad, just average","With so many dance music atrists out there that in two albums can go from wonderful to terrible, I would have to say Sasha is VERY consistent with what he does. This disc is diffucult to rate for me. I LOVE trance and all of Sasha's other stuff. This is not a CD I would ever sell, but would I buy it again? No. Of course its flawlessly mixed. There just isnt an overall mood to the CD. Just a bunch of OK, well mixed songs. I think if you boiled this CD into a 1 disc set you would have a 4-5 star trance CD. SO much of it is just boring and pointless and takes away all the momentum the CD should have. X-Pander is played so fast it just sounds silly (If you liked the EP version, you will HATE this). Aside from an annoying sample on the first song of disc 2, there isnt much to complain about here, but there isnt anything special either. If you are new to electronic music you will probally dig this. If you are a discriminating trancer, save your cash."
2,Waste,"I felt robbed of the $ I paid immediately after throwing in the first CD in the record store parking lot. I tried to find any track that had a slightly appealing beat, mixing highs and lows yet none of the tracks had any high rythmic beats. About 5 minutes later when I reached my house I thought to myself ""maybe it was just the first CD, the second one has to be better"" but it wasn't. I love most of Sasha's work, don't get me wrong, but these CDs were nothing but repetition over and over with the slightest changes cutting in and out bass lines and mid tones and of course digital samples thrown in every once in a while. I'll give you some advice, listen to the 30 second samples on Amazon and imagine them repeating for 6 minutes and you will have each song in its entirity."
2,whatever...,"Geez... I got suckered into this one.Relatively inexpensive way to make the mistake thou.Not what I had hoped... maybe my idea of unbelievable trance sets must be different to the others here. Not a patch on Gatecrasher Black -The Late set. Thats my idea of good trance.I really like Sasha's efforts with Northern Exposure...and a live set he did for Gatecrasher / Radio one... but this was far short of being, what I would describe as...""Timeless"".2 stars... coz I've heard worse."
2,Sasha is just as boring without Digweed as he is with him,"Although clearly skilled, for the most part this is a mind-numbing boring mix. The same beat over and over with little imagination given to transition. If this is what a crisp non-cheese album sounds like I'll vote for cheese."
5,Unbelievable,"I've heard and played a lot of trance in my time, and Sasha's CD stands out as iterally the greatest CD I have ever owned, and the greatest mix I have ever heard.I prefer the first CD over the second one, as it is easier to move to, but both are supreme in both their composition and execution. Breathtaking to hear, unbelievable to dance to, essential to own."
4,Disc 1 or Disc 2...?,"From reading the reviews, it seems like the great divide is between disc 1 or disc 2. Well, the first time I heard this disc was at my friend's house and I was in awe of the trancy opening song, ""Raff & Freddy - Deep Progress"" it was awesome! Track 2 is cool, but track 3 didn't do much for me, and then nice track 4 comes in... cd 1 is good. But I would have to say cd 2 is the better of the two. EVERY song on cd2 is SICK with the exception of #9. Skip that one and the rest is kickin' back magic. P.S. This GU is a LOT better than GU 9 (San Fran)."
5,Sasha is THE man!!,"Best Global Underground Album EVER!, if you know about something better, then you better mail me :)This is Awesome! and also so well mixed!I would give this one 6 stars if I could !!If you like Progressive Trance, then this will be it!!"
3,"Some good parts, but there's nothing really special...","Some DJs out there have the simple goal of giving people what they want to hear. The better DJs of this group (Paul Oakenfold, Keoki) know why what's popular works, and do a good job meeting expectations. Other DJs don't care what's popular - they simply find a style that they love and carry the torch for it. The good DJs here (Richie Hawtin, Tony De Vit) are great at converting others to this style.Sasha falls into neither group, which means that this set is neither a populist-type mix or a excursion into a new style. Therefore, there simply isn't much to talk about here. His ""Ibiza"" disc is well-mixed, and there are some highlights (namely the BT and Sander Kleinenberg tracks), but really this is just an average mix. Not bad if you're really into trance, but it wouldn't be my first pick."
5,Classic Sasha,"Won't bore you with a long review. This disk is a classic Sasha mix that you can listen to start to finish. Believe what the other reviewers say, if you want a disk you can throw on and listen to start to finish and appreciate the rise and fall, get this disk."
5,Excellent job,"Sasha has done an excellent job again. Not only he has chosen good tracks but also he has mixed them in a way that demonstrate why he is one of the best. A cd doesnt have to be filled with upbeat tracks so it can be more enjoyable. Perhaps some tracks are slow, or even not enjoyable as other tracks; nevertheless,the tracks are well chosen. Maybe sasha starts building his set with upbeat tracks,and we go along with it. And then he puts his set into a plateau, giving us the chance to catch a breath, before finally sending us to extacsy."
5,This is what it is all about,"Anyone who has been fortunate enough to experience one of Sasha's live sets will immediately acknowledge that this CD is truly what ""it"" is all about. There is one word that comes to mind when listening to a Sasha (or John Digweed) mix CD: Quality. This CD is the quenessential example of that. Overall, the programming, mixing, and production are all outstanding. Minor-key chord progressions (without a hint of cheese); cool sounds; powerful, unrelenting (yet smooth) basslines, and a sense of spaciousness evoke the emotions (and thoughts) that are the Sasha experience. After listening to this CD, one is left with the notion that there is an inexplicable, undeniable importance to this type of high-end Trance/Progressive House music. If you love (or even just like a little bit) intelligent music, do yourself (and everone else within earshot) a favor and purchase this compilation. It is the next best thing to being there."
4,"Not a regular disc for me, but I keep coming back.","Smooth, smooth discs. I'm not the hugest fan of the GU series, I have a few of them, but you cannot deny the mixing talent. I'm usually playing other CD's, but when I put this in since I haven't heard it in a while, I ask myself, why don't I play this more often? Recommended!"
3,Good to add to your Jamaican entertainment collection,"The movie was ok. But plot was off at times. In the beginning, her childhood girlfriend comes to see Gloria, and Gloria fills her in on what's been happening. But the way they were carrying on, you would think the girlfriend should have known all the things that had happened to her, like having seven kids. And you never really saw her interact with her kids. The ending was like falling of a cliff without knowing how you got on the cliff in the first place. One minute she has nothing, the next she had a hotel. It definitely showed how a Jamaican woman can persevere, but nothing I would aspire to go through. And it was longer than it needed to be. Some of the middle could have been cut out to strenghten the ending. Like I said, good to have in your Jamaican entertainment collection."
1,GET THE FACTS FIRST.........,"WAS READY TO BUY THIS BOOK AS I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED READING HER COLUMN. BUT AS AN ITALIAN AMERICAN , I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN HER STEROTYPICAL COMMENTS ABOUT RAO'S RESTAURANT THAT I PUT THE BOOK BACK ON THE SHELF. WHY WOULD AN INTELLIGENT WOMEN NOT GET HER INFORMATION CORRECT BEFORE PUTTING IT IN PRINT. SHAME ON HER!"
4,Tragic book,"This book kind of resonates with brecht's mother courage.For the heroine, the family farm became the main object itself, and it replaced the family.She falls far down enough to ask mercy for the savage who killed those dearest to her, showing that she fell to the brute level herself.In any case all of her life was in vain. At that time 40 was past childbearing age, and the farm she built so hard and sacrificed so much for will be sold by her brothers who left her there but would have the last laugh."
4,Type s dash lights are....,these type s/winplus lights are very good at what they do. i currently have two on my dash to help me see my gauges at night. very sleek smooth design. the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is because you have to use a cigrette lighter to power the little things. does not ruin my night vision at all.nemoskull.
3,pretty good but...,"This book was okay. It was extraaaaa long and I thought a lot of it could have been cut out. I never really connected with the characters. The use of the Hawaiian dialect, or whatever it was, really started to get on my nerves. But the plot did pick up after maybe the first 150 pages. I loved Kristen Heitzmann's older books and have bought one of her series, but all her new stuff just doesn't interest me."
2,Good and Bad,"When I started reading this book, it didn't grab my attention. I kept at it and then it picked up or to be trite ""the plot thickened."" Reading a bit more, the author started throwing in mini ""sermons."" I did not realize this was a ""christian"" book when I bought it. The ""sermonizing"" detracts from the story quite a bit. Basically, the story has the potential to be a great mystery/adventure/romance story if the author would clean up the ""sermonizing"" and fine-tune the editing. I was surprised that when a plane was flying from Hawaii to the mainland, the author referred to it as ""transatlantic."" My geography may be a bit rusty but if part of the trip was transatlantic that plane went way out of the way! If you like christian fiction, mystery and romantic literature then this might be a good read for you. For me, I'll read the reviews a bit closer before I buy books in the future and I won't buy any more by this author."
1,"Amazon needs to create a special catagory called ""Christian Books""","OK.....let's start....if I wanted to read a book that mentions God and Jesus on almost every page, I would have gone to a Christian Book Store. I got this one without realizing that the book is mainly written to preach. My bad. Now on to the story....not too bad but so many references to the bible that it is hard to see the story. I skipped from the first third to the second third and then to the end....while the plot is an interesting concept, again the Christian references ruined the story for me. Lone person out....one star."
2,"Good dialogue, but protracted","I pretty much enjoyed this book all the way through. The relationship between the two main characters is well-done, and their conversation is often fairly witty. I was going to give this three stars because, as another reviewer said, it did need editing, It would tell one story (amnesia, being forced onto a plane at gunpoint) and then slack off to describe the emptiness of the Hollywood life, etc. Then the plot would pick up again. It didn't really seem tied together. She did a slapdash job of making the villian seem human, so much so that it might have been better if he was just fully evil. But it held my attention.Then, somewhere in the last half of the book, they misspelled Jane Austen's name. (That's right. I-N.) I paid for this book and I expected a professional job. Especially from Bethany House. It not only took me out of the story, it made me think that if a (paid) copy editor couldn't be bothered to read this thoroughly, why should I?"
3,Freefall,"I enjoyed the book. It was more exciting and had more suspense at the beginning. Near the end I was a little bored with it. I sometimes got lost in the old Hawaiian language. Also some of the Hawaiian spirituality was difficult for me to relate to. It talked about many problems that are common to everyone and all families and friends and how the characters' faith helped them through difficult times. Overall,I am glad that I read it."
3,hard review to write,"This is a hard review to write. The only other book I have read by this author is ""Edge of Recall"". I loved that book. When I read this was a romantic suspense I couldn't wait to read it. Although I think Kristen Heitzmann is anexcellent author, I could not get thrilled about this book. The book really only consisted of about 40 pages of suspense. It read more like a soap opera. 5 or 6 weeks in the lives of 10 or so people. I could actually skip 8 pages and not miss a thing. The book was mostly conversation between people and that cannot hold me to a book. It was very easy to put down and just pick back up whenever. I wasn't glued to the book. Like I said, she writes well, she just wrote too much in this case."
3,Didn't like it but couldn't put it down,It took FOREVER to finish this book but I couldn't stop. I loved all the characters but the religious diversions bogged down the story line. I accept that the characters had all found Jesus but entire chapters devoted to that were really unnecessary. I knew who the bad guy was very early in the book so that was pretty disappointing. I bought this book because I love Kauai & was excited about reading a story that featured it. I'll be more careful next time & I will NEVER read another book by this author!
3,An Intertesting Read,"The story was interesting, kept my attention. Writing was OK. I liked the perspective of life from a celebrity's viewpoint. I enjoyed the unexpected plot turns in the story. The story could have been shorter though."
5,Very Satisfied Reader,"Freefall grabbed me from the start and pulled me along right through to the end. I could not put the book down. The writing was informative and clear, making me feel as though I was witness to the events. It makes me search out more of Kristen's books. Great job !!"
1,Review the content (look inside) first !,"Wish I had reviewed the content of this book BEFORE buying it. The six categories have no empirical basis and the author evidently has no experience actually advising anyone. He is a former reporter for Money magazine.His other book, Everyone's Money Book was co-authored with Sonny Bloch (see url link below for article about Bloch) who I since learned landed in prison for his on air crookery. So, lot's to question about this author's judgment and expertise!http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_talking_dirty/index.html"
3,Does not fit narrow rails,"The bag seems well constructed. It's volume is 28 cu. inches. I was able to fit a road tube, 2 small tire levers, a $20 bill, and my keys. I can't see how you could fit much more. The clip-on system that is uses, however, did not fit my saddle rails. At their widest, my rails are 4.5 cm measured from the inside of the rails. The clip requires that you have rails that are 6 cm apart measured from the inside. Unfortunately I was never able to use the bag because of this but if I had been able to, the bag itself seems pretty durable. Although I'd keep looking around because many other reviewers seem to have problems with the clip system braking with relatively little use (<300 miles)."
3,great size but ripped,"great bag, love the size but it did rip at the top where the zipper and bag come together after a week of having it. I sewed it back together. Other wise love the back. I'm still using it currently. And i had to order the to peak F22 wdge pack fixer for racing style rail saddle to fit my seat but still a great product."
3,Nice bag for the right seat,"This is a great compact bag. Large enough for a road tube, a multi tube an inovations microflate head with 16gr CO2 cartridge. However, it may not fit some seats and, in my case, if the seat is too far forward it may not mount. May want to try before you buy."
5,"challenging, but worth the read","Yes, i would agree with the reviewer above, this is a challenging read. But that is what makes it so thoroughly lucid and insightful. It takes some time getting use to Williams' style, but once you pick up on the rhythm of his prose, his ideas begin to unfold in a rich tapestry of dialectic critique. The chapters on ""Hegemony,"" ""Residual, Dominant, Emergent,"" and ""Language"" are excellent for anyone interested in moving beyond the base/superstructure of orthodox Marxism and into more dynamic cultural materialist understanding of change."
5,A primer on decks and patios,"It's a great book. We needed ideas and some inspiration, and that's what we got. Lots of pictures, good tips. No fluff. It steered us away from simply pouring a concrete patio and laying out some lawn chairs. It ran the gamut from drainage, slope and elevation, to materials and costs."
2,Too much showroom - too little information,"The majority of the book are example pictures of decks and patios and quotes from designers about how to set a mood, picking a spot etc. Too little is dedicated to the details of building it."
4,Great Book,I liked this book a lot. I think it touches on the topic of revival from different angles.It is written in the same way Ravenhill always preached: straight to the point.It really helped me to understand revival and especially on the basis of Joel 2.I highly recommend this book to everybody. I think it is quite easy to read.
5,Convicting,If you want a book that will challenge you to go further with God and a book that will show you God's heart for the lost and dying people around you then read this book. Every page was worth reading.
5,WONDERFUL,"--- One man's view: Lewis was a rare genius. This intriguing work will always be lively and fresh for your ears. Nice light texture. And JL swings so well at times! And with an orchestra, to boot! Innovative yet light. I only wish more people knew about this clear winner!"
5,Great!,This mount works great for holding my husbands Line 6 POD. He plays direst at our church and uses his POD to do so. He like playing while standing and this mount coupled with a mic stand work great so he can easily switch while playing.
1,vacuum sanding pole,I think the Vacuum Pole Sander was a second the sanding pad is not flat and will not sand the drywall right it leaves it with makes and goves at the wall
5,The Best,"Being a Dominican away from my country, my mother found this book and gave it to her three children going to school in the states. To my surprise, the flavors and the different recipes where almost the exact same recipes at home. I think the author did an excellent job in contacting the best chefs in the island to get a concensus of what Dominicans truly eat. My experience with cookbooks is that they rarely get as many recipes as this book done right."
4,The english version is rediculously expensive,"I am overall satisfied with the book. With a minor in spanish, I still have a hard time translating some of the words. Also, the cuts of meat that is mentioned in the book are not familiar to me. I will have to do some research I suppose. Overall, I got a collectors edition of the book which was new and still in the plastic, from the early 90s. I love latin american cuisine and will continue to add to my collection!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I agree with the other reviewer that it was not user friendly. I made two of the recipes and they both came out horrible. I consider this book more a ""cultural snapshot"" than an actual cookbook."
1,this company is a pack of thieves and hoodlums,"this company is a pack of thieves and hoodlumsthey never call you back , when you call them they pretend like the product doesnt belong to them when you get them to own up to it, they say they are no longer in buiness.. BEWARE"
1,Avoid QPS,"I have had no end of trouble with my 60 MB QueM3 drive from QPS. I've never gotten any help from them, either. It finally just died after I got very little use out of it. I have no idea if this drive works with PCs or not, but with my Mac, it has been a great disappointment."
1,Unreliable and the worst support,"Frankly, I'm surprised Que is still in business. If you purchase their hardware you can be sure they will never upgrade the drivers, so your hardware will be obsolete the minute you buy if. If your hardware happens to break, which is likely, you can forget returning it since their support line is busy 24x7, and they never return email.In short, their product is junk, and I will never buy another Que product again, which is even more likely considering they won't be in business much longer."
5,Really great songs,"This was the very first recording I bought, after I discovered David Phelps on Gaither Homecoming DVDs at a friends house. I wanted to know who he was, and then I heard No More Night, and I was hooked. I found this CD on the Internet, shared it with my friend, Laurie, and she went directly out to buy it, bought Revelation instead, because we could not find this one. The next day, she went out again and found this one. We love David, her mother and my daughter think he is great. He is precious to me. His ministry is so genuine, and his music is nourishment for my soul. I appreciate that he is so into the wonder of God's grace. I like many of his songs better than some of the hymns I sang as a child. He takes this stuff seriously, and I like that. I have lived a long time on this earth, and I hope he does."
2,Love David's Voice-isliked this CD,I was not impressed with David's self-titled CD. I was sadly disappointed that he did not do more songs that enhanced his awesome voice. I love watching him on the Gaither series videos-So when I heard this CD-It was a huge let down.Maybe he needs to change managers or labels?
