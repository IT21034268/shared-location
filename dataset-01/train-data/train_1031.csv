2,Poor device,I have used this mouse in a public library setting and it does not hold up very well. The mouse cord seems to fray at the mouse end. It looks great but is not practical for constant use. You would think that when it was originally designed for children's use they would have incorporated ruggedness into the design too.
1,"His Worst Book, Period","Frankly, I couldn't believe that McMurtry wrote this. I was so excited to see a sequel to The Desert Rose- it could have been great. The only interesting character in the entire (long) book is Harmony's son- and after awhile I even found him to be annoying. And come on- the dog jumped off the Statue of Liberty and lived? McMurtry made a name for himself by writing about reality- maybe he should stick to that."
4,Different is good sometimes......,"This book is different from McMurtry's other work. Accept it, and enjoy it for what it is. Some of the characters Harmony meets in her travels are hilarious. The three ""ragheads"" she meets in New York are adorable. In the past, you just couldn't trust McMurtry. You form a relationship with his characters, and he knocks them off. Not this time. Take it to the beach; you can't put it down. Sections are laugh-out-loud funny."
2,McMurty slips in this one.,"I usually have big fun reading LMcM's novels, but this one fell far short of the mark. I guess I really prefer his novels set in the old West and other action fare.Most of the characters just wore me out. Sort of wanted to slap them. Pretty silly in spots. And, how can a bunch of adults be bossed around by a five year of kid. The dog jumping off the Statue of Liberty and living was another aspect that was hard to accept. Thinking back, it's hard to come up with a character I could really care about.On the plus side, it was a fast read and the usual interesting McMurtry dialog was always present.Mr. McMurtry has given me so much reading pleasure in the past that I will still await his future offerings. No one bats 1.000, so he's entitled to a miss."
3,So-so,"This is a sequel to DESERT ROSE. Harmony's daughter Pepper has just died of AIDS in NYC, and she (Harmony) and her 5-year-old son Eddie drive cross country from Las Vegas to retrieve her. Typically off-the-wall McMurtrian adventures occur - all their belongings go over a cliff at the Grand Canyon, Eddie gets to meet Pres. Clinton and also get on the Letterman show because of his dog, they befriend people who live in a dumpster. But the characters are just strange and out of touch and hard for us to relate to. Children are not usually portrayed very well by McMurtry, and Eddie is no exception: he acts and talks like an old man, which becomes unbelievable and very annoying after a while. There are contrivances in all of McMurtry's books, but they are too heavy-handed here. Not one of his better novels."
4,Good Guitar Stand,"I have bought this stand for my Yamaha Acoustic guitar. Quality is good with enough padding and support. I was expecting the brand name ""YAMAHA"" printed somewhere on it. But there is no brand name printed anywhere on this guitar stand. It has just one ""Made in China"" sticker. The height of the stand can be adjusted to support guitars of different size."
3,Clogs easily,"Sander tracks reasonably well (not great - yet far better than the old Craftsman that was thrown out), is able to handle rough grits easily (unlike the AEG I gave up on). Does what I ask it to do (rough sanding) BUT will clog quickly (something that seems to be prevalent in other reviews I have read). The primary reason for writing this review is to advise that it is easy to clean the clog with an air compressor gun (not like another reviewer who disassembled his machine to remove the clog with small screwdrivers). As another reviewer noted the dust bag is less than adequate (I run it directly into the shop-vac - which leaves a clean surface and little dust in the air). For the price a decent machine that still could use some improvements in the problem areas, but not one of Bosch's best products."
4,Great sander - used to sand a deck,I really like this sander and have used it to sand a modest size deck (9' x 20') - lots of sanding belts but the sander was flawless. Don't like the bag so much but not a big deal either. I pushed this off my work table and broke the front handle but was able to get a replacement for five bucks at ereplacement dot com. I have used this upside down which was an unexpected feature based on its flat top.
4,Decent sander,"I bought this sander after trying the Dewalt and having it die in about 15min of work. After researching other sanders, I discovered B&D; owns Porter-Cable and Delta, along with Dewalt. Since every B&D; tool I have ever purchased failed, I am hesitant to give B&D; my money.I chose the Bosch after comparing with its twin, the Ryobi BE321. The sander is well balanced and comfortable in your hands. It took a little getting used the ""brick"" design, but The egornomics are great. It has the power to get the job done. The dust colletion is average. Afterall, it is a belt sander!I would recommend this sander to anyone."
5,Just a little off the top,"I'll be honest, this is my first belt sander, but I love it. I took the recommendation of some of the other reviewers, and I couldn't agree more. The sander is easy to use out of the box, and is a smooth-running, well-designed tool. The variable speed switch is very nice, and adds considerably to the user's control. I haven't yet done any heavy duty sanding, but for finish work the dust collection seems to work well. Five stars for Bosch on this one."
4,Update and solution to dust collector issue,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the dust collection system is poor. Mine keeps coming off and frankly, it gets in the way. I beleive I have come up with a good solution. I have a Porter-Cable finish sander #333vs and it has a unique dust collection system. Called a sand trap, it is a porus cup that works quite well, collecting even the finest sandings. I purchased a spare cup for [$$$] and mounted it on the 1274 with a 1 inch piece of plastic tubing and a clamp. It seems to work perfectly. I'll advise after I use it a month or so. You can buy the sand trap from Porter Cable direct by calling technical services listed on their web site."
3,Cheap dust bag not the one pictured otherwise good product,"Product seems to work fine, however I would like the item to be exactly like the picture. The one that was sent to me had a cheap looking bag attached which did not look like the picture. It did not have the black support or even Bosch written on it anywhere. (Say cheap generic bag if that is what you are going to include with the product)"
5,Awesome!! Nothings Better,"This is an extremely well-designed and well-built sander. No complaints here only praise, praise, praise!Thank you Bosch--you sure make my life a lot better!!"
5,Tool Happy!,"This is one fine tool for the job of sanding our boat! I don't think I would have found a better deal anywhere else for as good quality and $ as I did here at Amazon, not to mention the fantastik 2-day delivery! Thanks again, Amazon!"
1,Bad Purchase,"This tool is not grounded and is not properly insulated, I get a shock of electricity every time I use it. There is no speed adjustment, just slow, no power, my belts keep braking. The dust bag keeps fly off. I recommend staying away from this tool."
2,Not a heavy duty sander,"My first project with this tool was ~64 sq.ft. of peeling deck planks. I broke or shredded 3 belts in the process and the handle got very hot. By the end the graphite pad had worn badly and also left a number of black marks on my decking. My old Dewalt 430 had none of these problems on the same type of decking.Also the sander doesn't seem wide enough. A new belt sticks out about 1/8"" over the side and tracking adjustments don't help. Maybe this is why belts fail so fast. If I had bought this at Lowes I would already have taken it back.On the positive side it is light and compact and the dust collection works well. It's just not up to the abuse I need to be able to give a sander."
2,Plastic belt change lever = Big design Fault,"Sure , Swiss sourced , German design , Bosch Name ......ALL FAILThe world of tool use is a jungle , and this sander dies quick.The belt release lever is of molded PLASTIC that weakens with stress cycles and breaks off.....no matter how you baby it ....The thing is not fit for it's intended useAn expensive shadow of a sander"
5,cajun mom,Love this cd so many songs for such a good price. I highly recommend this cd to all that enjoy cajun music.
1,Straight Garbage,"The song Do or Die might be the only song worth listening too.And if you happen to listen to that paticular song play it once and don't play it for about 6 months later.It will sound alright then.Dont you dare play it back 2 back.You will be ready to slang the disc out the window of your car while your on the expressway listening to it while your going out of town cuz you heard all your good c.d.s earlier but you dont want to play them over & over.If you from the bottom ,We all know that aint nothin banging coming out of Broward County!!!"
1,junk,"I purchased a new boat , and this charger was put on at the factory. It didn't last 8 months, and it wasn't used that much. Take my advice, don't buy this model or brand !"
3,"Great (Fun) Music, but poor reissue",A fun disco jam all the way through. The sound quality is disappointing and the last song on my copy was clipped (!). A gem for collectors though.
1,ONE OF THE ALL-TIME WORST DISCO RECORDINGS EVER!,Textbook example of the kind of stuff that gave disco a bad name (and I'm a disco fan). Strictly for flamers.
2,Deeply talented author-- shallow plot,"The only thing that kept me reading ""Blue Light"" until the end was Mosley's general skill as a writer. His style reminded me of two SF greats-- Octavia E. Butler and Tad Willams. Hardly faint praise.But Mosley forgot to include the one thing these two luminaries always have in their books in abundance and that is scope. The events of the book don't really seem to change anything; they only concern a handful of characters. Certainly the reader doesn't feel, as with Butler, that the fabric of society, even the nature of humanity, will be changed by the blue light. Outside the concerns of the main characters, it is business as usual for Planet Earth. While it is irkome to think of what this book could have been with a plot constructin equal to Mosley's writing talents, I have to applaud him for making the foray into science fiction. The genre definitely needs more ethnic diversity in its authors. I hope Mr. Mosley will try again-- this time with a better plot!"
2,Mosley fans tread warily,"I have enjoyed Mr. Mosley's books immensely previously and it was with great relish I picked up ""Blue Light"". Unfortunately, I feel the need to warn other Mosley devotees that this is not what you are expecting. Change in and of itself is not a negative, of course, however, Blue Light is so utterly different in subject matter, structure and genre (for want of a better term) that I feel it will disappoint many. I must admit that I am not a Sci-Fi fan and my view needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. One positive for Blue Light is that Mosley is apparently receiving the attention that his previous work should have garnered him."
2,A little bit too weird.,"This attempt at transcending the sci-fi genre ends up feeling like a mixed bag. Rather gory at parts, it ends up feeling like an alternative Anne Rice universe with the emphasis on blood and sex. If there was a higher metaphysical purpose or meaning in the story, I missed it."
1,Lacks the punch of Mosley's other books,Blue Light lacks the attention to detail that gives Mosley's other books their impact. The characters never come alive. The plot is slow and the reader waits for something to happen.
3,"Creative, but...","The writing in ""Blue Light"" is always creative, and sometimes poetic. The plot, however, is disjointed, and (at least to me) just did not make a lot of sense. If you are a science fiction fan, you will probably enjoy this book. Otherwise, it is probably not worth the time."
1,Appallingly bad,"Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that ""science fiction"" means ""logic and plausibility get tossed out the window."" That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here."
1,Dim Story,"This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time."
4,The blueprint for a new agenda,"There were so many themes that ran throughout this novel; but, to the 'naked' eye an average person would not be able to read between the lines. The biggest themes that I gathered from this book are 'realizing that our awareness is always expanding' and that 'man's greatest challenge is himself.' Unlike his other books where there was one main character, with this book you can hear Walter Mosley speaking in a spectrum of voices. Where before ""Always Outnumbered"" gave us true contemporary (circa post-1995) African-American fiction, ""Blue Light"" has allowed Mr. Mosley alongside OctaviaButler to push the outer boundaries of the literary fiction genre."
1,Worst Mosley of all....,I have enjoyed all of Walter Mosley's works and was shocked as tried to read this most atypical of his writings. It's so bad that I put it down after passing the half-way point and I don't give up on a book easily. Mosley should dance the dance that he knows so well and leave the science fiction(?) to science fiction writers.
5,Mosley captivates and intrigues from beginning to end!,"This book is rich with symbolism. When I first started reading the book, I thought Mosley had gone over the deep end. As I continued to read, I realized why he is one of the best."
1,It SUCKS!!!!,"I'm a big Mosley fan, but this book sucks!! I just cant get into it. The characters are boring and the whole story just doesn't make sense. There was nothing reedeming about the story line or the characters. I found it very hard to pay attention to what I was reading. I only finished the book (like the other reader said) to get rid of it."
2,"Big Mosley Fan, but this Didn't Work for Me","I've loved all of Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries (with the possible exception of ""Gone Fishin""), so I figured I'd give this new genre a shot. I couldn't wait to finish this one--so I could get rid of it! Admittedly, I'm not much of a supernatural fan, but much of this book just made no real sense to me. The plot really goes nowhere, and the violence and sex almost seem gratuitous. I wish Walter Mosley would stick to the mysteries and leave this stuff to the Stephen Kings of the world."
3,"Deeply Profound, Dogmatically Disappointing","Walter Mosely's writing style will captivate you, in fact it is the catalyst that brings you to the end of this trite novel. However the unfathomable plot and foolhardy character's make you wonder, when will this novel end? Mosely's attempt at the mystical is by all means fulfilled. The ""blue light"" awakens those who perceive, touch, and experience the bounty of death, and it is the character death that leads Mosely's diverse characters into the depths of the woods. The culmination occurs in a place where the fearless ""blue lights"" believe they are safe (and you thought this group was enlightened). You would think in the early stages of the novel that Mosely is attempting to reveal a divine group of individuals, who are on the brink of understanding the essense of life, however the end reveals this story is nothing more than a ficticious tale of good versus evil."
4,"Sci-Fi, Supernatural, Thriller, Mystery....Maybe????!!!!","I, too, like so many others, didn't know what to expect when I first started reading Blue Light, but I must be honest and admit that overall I wasn't disappointed.It's definitely a different kind of read for me, but it had enough of the elements that I look for in a book to keep me reading, i.e. action, drama, suspense, chaos-confusion. I particularly liked the spin Mosley put on the ending. I found myself laughing at my attempt to make it all make sense when I didn't have to. Once you read Blue Light you will know what I mean.At first this book was a stretch for me but I thoroughly enjoyed the journey in the end. Thanks Walter Mosley!"
1,Stephen King Meets the Wizard of Oz,"I picked up this book in anticipation of a discussion with my monthly book club this coming weekend. We had previously read RL's Dream and I found that difficult to follow but considered it historical fiction. Now we enter the Blue Light. This book had none of the lyrical language I found so endearing in RL's Dream. This was a violent journey through a twisted utopia with no purpose. In a bow to the 60's, this was an acid trip gone very bad with a short fun period in the middle. The meanies were cardboard cartoon characters and the goodies were always running from them like Dorothy, Tin Man and Scarecrow through the poppy fields. I can't wait to see who picked this in our book club...Thanks for letting me share."
4,A wonderful diversion ...,This read is much different from Moseley's other works. I'm hungry for more. Way to go Easy!
4,Oh man what a wild wild ride,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers in that I was looking for a story closer to the Easy Rawlins series when I picked this up. What I got however was a journey,one that was hypnotic, fascinating, repulsive and rivetting. I read this book on 2 flights and was gripped from start to finish. This book demands an open mind and the ability to accept Mosley's utopia. A great deal of it attempts to paint life and death in very holistic terms, varied degrees of energy or ""blue light"" and how it effects each one differently. Read it but brace yourself."
2,Super Reader,"A strange alien presence manifests itself on Earth as a blue light, and infects a small number of people. One of them, just as he was dying. He become the Gray Man, and has a thing for going around and killing these 'Blues' rather violently.The Blues become something more than human, and go off to live by themselves in a sort of cult, as well as some others they have partly infected.It is all kind of pointless, and the end makes you just about want to yell about how bad it is.Avoid."
2,Blinded by the Light,I bought Blue Light blindly and in excitement thinking it was another Easy Rawlins mystery. The color in the title totally threw me off. I couldn't even get myself past the first half. Maybe my pallet was just too ready for more Easy and I never really gave it a chance. I've picked it up again since and just coudln't do it.. lol. I'll leave this one up to you Sci-Fi fans out there. I'll stick to the mysteries and his other novels. Always will be a Walter Mosley fan.
4,beware of plastic trigger,This is an excellent drill but be careful of plastic paddle trigger.I managed to break it on month after purchase.
4,Fits in tight spots and is powerful and light,"This drill is a great alternative to the more expensive and beefier 1/2"" right angle drill from Milwaukee. The angle of the drill head to the body is not perpendicular as you can see in the picture and that makes for great comfort in using the tool plus it is very light. I had to reroute some electical wire and this is the tool to cut new holes into the wall studs. I only gave it 4 stars due to the chuck being somewhat difficult to spin by hand due to a small surface with which to grip and the fact that it didn't turn very easily."
3,bad switch?,"I am just a general hobbyist so I actually have no real need for this drill, I just bought it to have it. I was using it to drill small (1/4 to 1"" holes) in plywood with Forstner bits. I drilled about 100 holes over a 2 week period and the drill FAILED. It appears to be a switch problem, but am waiting for report. I had to take drill to authorized fix it place, and am waiting for a call back to trek over there and pick it up. IF I was an electrcian who needed a tool like this I would be highly pissed off. After all the reason to pay Milwaukee's price is to get a quality tool not something that cant even drill 100 small holes."
3,I really wanted to like this drill...,"I used this drill for doing the low voltage wiring for my house ... it worked great for two weekends and is now shot. I was probably using bits that were too big for the drill (5/8"" and 1"" auger bits), but it would bind up and (eventually) I think the gears wore out. Now it just sounds like it's ratcheting and it won't drill into anything with a bit bigger than 1/8"" or so.While it worked it was great... handy around the corners and worked like a champ. As long as you don't need something that is truly heavy duty (ignore what it says on the box), this is the drill for you."
1,Close Quarter Drill not worth it!,"My wife purchased a close-quarter drill as a Christmas present in 2001. One year and 3 months later, it no longer works. Apparently it can't handle 3/4 and 1 inch bits. I called Milwaukee to get service, and they tell me that I abused their heavy duty drill. I personally would not recommend this drill to any contractor that needs a tool that will last."
1,"Hobby drill with 1/2"" chuck?","If you intend to do any serious drilling (e.g. home-building) just buy one of Milwaukee's professional 90 degree drills. There is no way the plastic helical gears on this one have the strength to drive the work that one would want a 1/2"" chuck for. I also did not find that the size of this allowed much more access then a regular 90. I know I asked alot of this drill but that's why I bought one with a 1/2"" chuck and for the price, I never expected that it would break so quickly."
4,Classic Folk,"This person, Odetta, had a good heart with a lotta-love to put out there. Her sound on cover's and her own songs will move because she was a beautiful person. So pull-up a cushion and enjoy, and I hope you'll too be moved as I am."
4,Great,"Tradition MastersIt was so good to hear my ""old"" friend after all of these years. Odetta has never sounded better. Quality of sound is great and if you are a fan the ""Tradition Masters"" this is for you."
4,Jackie's finest recent movie!,"Jackie portrays an excellent role of a saddened cop, who wasn't able to save his team. Encouraged by a mysterious friend to try and win over their killers he embarks on a journey which will reveal double crosses, opponent's true motives and a brilliant ending. I feel that there are better Jackie Chan movies out there, but this being made in China is a far superior to any of his American flicks."
3,Not Very Good,"If you are a Jackie Chan fan, you might want to purchase it, otherwise, you are much better off just renting.Although, this movie has many action in it, many of it is composed of shooting and explosions. The martial arts choreography isn't good compared to Jackie Chan's other movies. There isn't much humour either.Overall, it is an okay movie."
1,really disappointed,"My husband and I have enjoyed several of Jackie Chan's movies and I bought this one because of a rating I read, which was a bit mistake. Neither one of us liked it and couldn't even finish the movie."
3,Not in the Police Story spirit,"This movie was nothing like the first four movies. Maybe because JAckie is older? The stunts were really weak, and the movie focused a lot more on Jackie's ability to act and therefore had many emotional scenes and lots of plot detailing. Not an action movie in any sense. Still, it was decent to watch."
2,Love of a Stranger,"Alex McGregor and Doug Hawkins meet under less than perfect conditions; her first sight of him is seeing him with the woman her husband cheated with, ending their marriage. Yet, it is a beginning, and the two get closer after a mysterious fire kills Alex's ex husband and the cabin he was in at the time. Life continues to get her Doug and Alex's way, making romance something both want, but a secondary consideration. However, good things come to those who wait.Sometimes, it feels like the main plot gets lost in the details of this meandering novel. Both Doug and Alex are scarred souls contending with things that re-open old wounds constantly. However, the story has a realism that many will find appealing.Amanda Killgore"
4,easy to walk away from,"This was the third book I'd read by Jeffrey. The first two, I gave 5 stars. I couldn't put them down once I started reading. This one wasn't like those. I was glad when it was over. Alex is too mean and self centered and took too long to come around. Her battle with Doug went on and on and on. Finally, she gave in. I'm glad this one is over. I do look forward to reading other books by Jeffrey in the near future. Happy reading."
3,Almost there,"The plot is engaging enough, the dialogues are beliavable and the characters go through their share of development. Alex was a bit exasperating at times but that was part of her growth. Ted was very pathetic, byt the way, even as a secondary character. It's actually 2 1/2 stars from me on account of all the spelling mistakes- it doesn't feel like the novel was proofread, let alone reviewed by a professional editor (it doesn't start so bad but it gets worse towards the end of the story). Be advised that it has a few steamy scenes, but they're not completely gratuitous. The story about the land rights and the forest was interesting."
3,Okay..,"I became so obsessed with the first book, the love of a cowboy that I have to admit I was holding hope that this one would be as juicy as the previous. I think that it fell a little short in holding a candle to the love of a cowboy...however, it was a cute story. I really do like Anna Jeffrey's books, of you haven't read one now's the tome to start."
3,This can't be the end.,"This movie wasn't so good. The ending seemed so insignificant, along with the rest of the movie. I'm sure someone is going to make a new Planet of the Apes movie, they just can't end it like this. And for kicks they should have Heston play a cameo as Taylor's grandson or something, that would be cool."
1,The worst!!!!,"As a child growing up in the height of ""Ape Movies"", I looked forward to seeing this movie. I fell asleep half way through it. I've seen it a couple more times in the past 15 years to see what I missed,and I still find it just as boring.Remember, with every ape movie released, their budget became smaller and smaller.(Those tightwads!!8^D)""Introducing Paul Williams"". He made his mark in movies! Remember ""Love Boat""? Need I say more?"
2,Buy the boxed set,"This is the fourth in the series of POTA films. Although Roddy McDowell retains a starring role and there is a minor role for John Huston overall it really is pretty poor.The budget for this movie was clearly much less than the first two films. This and the lack of an original story are probably the main reasons for its failure. The 'battle' for the planet, it turns out takes place in a moderately sized field between a few dozen humans and a few dozen apes.In itself the acting was OK but in places the script did nobody any favours and I struggled to retain any sort of interest after the first 1/2 hour. Fortunately it is only a short film (83mins) so if you do decide to buy it your suffering will be mercifully short.I'd recommend buying the boxed set which contains all the films and an excellent documentary. This represents far better value for money."
4,"Finally, the Uncut Version of Battle is on DVD!","This version of Battle for the Planet of the Apes is the uncut version that contains the scenes of the Alpha Omega bomb. These scenes make a clear connection between the mutants in Beneath and the ones in this film. Of course, Mendez is still there in the chopped version, but many might not connect him with the Mendez dynasty alluded to in the second film. These scenes make a huge difference in this film. I'd say they elevate the film from 3 to 4 stars.The most obvious way to differentiate the two versions is the cover. The cut version has Virgil, an orangutan on it. This version has a picture of a very angry chimp or gorilla. In the cut version, you see Virgil from the chest up, the latter only has a face above the logo and a few film clips below it. While I'd really only recommend this to apes fans, I'd say anyone who's truly devoted to this series must own it."
3,The last part...,"Following the rise of the apes and some sort of man-made catastrophe (probably nuclear war) a community of apes and humans live together in peace. It's the evil human survivors of the nuclear war who still live in New York City who have an issue with the situation and all sorts of hijinks ensue.Probably the weakest film in the series it is also the one that really requires the viewer to have a strong grasp of what went on in the other movies, especially Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Still, it IS good sci-fi!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING...BORDERING ON SUSPECT...,"THE first four drugs I wanted to look up were not in here!!!!!!! Common ones. I checked spellings, etc., NOTHING, NADA. The other disappointment is how little is provided about the drawbacks of drugs, info that is easily available at this point for years. I speak most especially about Prozac as an example. Nary a word about the horrendous reputation this drug now has...I rarely think about actually returning a book, but I thought seriously, several times, about returning this one. So much potential, so much need for facts, and so very skewed in its presentation. Major bummer, authors... Don't bother buying a new one; get it as cheaply as possible so you can invest in things that give you wider base of info also.....And oh BTW, the drugs I looked up are NOT new, as this book is 2005 (e.g. Welbutrin, Claritin). Want to clarify that."
3,Needs work,"I can't be too harsh on this video. There could have been worse. My main problem was that I hardly think some of these informants ""rats"" new what the hell they were talking about. For anyone who is interested in the mafia, it can get awful frustrating sometimes to figure out what really happened in the lives of these famous mobsters. To call an expose Luciano/Genovese/Valachi, you would think it would get pretty in depth about these three men and they're connection with each other. I do realize they were all part of the same Family. Pretty nice, gruesome scene at the end with Carmine Galante and his bodyguard/associate, or whatever the hell he was lying in a pool of blood. Whoever the person was with Galante, I rarely here anything about the guy who was killed with him so I can assume he was for the most part insignificant. A video of this caliber sure wouldn't have provided the answers."
1,It's supposed to be new - but looks very used,"I will be sending this product back. It came in a Swiss Army box, but not the one that the watches come in. All the plastic covers look like they were taken off, stuck on a dirty window and then put back on. Everything about it makes it feel like somebody wore it for a year and decided to sell it. There's no way I can give this out as a Christmas Gift. Very disappointing."
5,Brilliant,Every page is valuable. I underlined so many points that some pages are filled with ink from my pen.
2,"Do as he says, not as he does","When Rhodes stresses the necessity of checking facts, he writes that ""I'm as corny as Kansas in August"" is a line from a song in ""Oklahoma."" Nope--it's from ""South Pacific."" It's easy to see how he made the mistake--Kansas is right next door to Oklahoma, and both musicals are by Rodgers and Hammerstein--but clearly he didn't check that fact."
2,Not Much There,"This book didn't say much at all. It was more of a pat on the back for the author's other works than anything inspirational for his readers. I grew tired of the self-congratulations, but managed to make it to the end. For anyone looking for a book that will help inspire you to write, for a book that offers sound advice, or even a book that is fun to read, keep looking. This author needs to step down from his horse, because it's way too high."
4,A quality mix to inspire growth in your writer's craft.,"This solid book will inspire you to pick up the pen andtake your muse out for a walk. A pleasant mix that servesup a full course meal for the writer in you. Rhodes useshis own growth, from a young struggling writer of HallmarkCards to a Pulitzer Prize winning author, to enlight andencourage us. He covers writers block, agents, research,editing and more. His style is accessible, the contentpractical, with no attempt to be a comphrensive guide. Nota series of writing exercises, ala Natalie Goldberg or JuliaCameron, this book is more like a conversation with someonewho's been there, done that."
1,weak sauce,"Remember back in like the '90s when you couldn't find good trance anywhere and picking CDs at Tower or Best Buy was like a lottery where you picked total crud 99% of the time by some DJ Whoever or ""Trance Anthems"" style CD??? Well this CD felt just like that. Break out my time machine to 1996 and put this Trancemaster CD back on the shelf! ALL the tracks were weak weak weak.Stick to Markus Schulz/Gabriel& Dresden/Kyau vs. Albert/Above & Beyond mixes for the best of today and tomorrow."
3,"Nothing really wrong with these accounts, but they cannot stand up to the competition","There is nothing really wrong with this collection of Delius favorites from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra under Myer Fredman. The trouble is that with collections from e.g. Mackerras and Barbirolli available at comparable prices (not to speak of Beecham, but I have to admit that I personally really require stereo sound in this repertoire) it isn't really competitive. First of all, the sound quality of this disc is nothing to write home about, being distant and somewhat boomy. Compared to the competition this version of Eventyr also sounds a little lackluster and bland. Brigg Fair and Paris, on the other hand, go rather better, accomplished and atmospheric playing but without being exceptional. I guess the final verdict, then, must be that you won't go seriously wrong with this issue, but there are better ways to spend your money and time."
4,Short Changed,"This is a must buy, if you want a copy of Short Shorts or Believe Me, one of my favorite songs of 1959 -- right up there with the Crests' The Angels Listened in -- both of which I used to hear on the jukebox at the local A&W; back in the day. Neither of these songs are on Time/Life's wonderful collection of 50's and early 60's gems, The Rock 'n' Roll Era, which comprises some 50 CDs!The problem with this release is that it's sourced (or at least the older copies, I bought mine in 1997) from an L.P., not the master tapes. Listening to the ""samples,"" I doubt that anyone at Collectables has bothered to upgrade it; and, in fact, the master tapes may be ""lost"" or destroyed. In which case, this is the best we'll get and may explain why Believe Me is not on any of Time/Life's or Rhino's Doo Woop compilation CDs...I've been searching for an upgrade for years; hopefully, the masters will show up one day and we'll get the quality release these two wonderful songs deserve.John"
2,The Royal Teens,"If your looking for a good copy of the song ""Believe Me"" by the Royal Teens, you can find it on a few CD's in a lot better quality than on this CD. ACE out of the UK has it on ""Golden Age Of American Rock & Roll - Volume 10"", Rhino has it on ""The Doo Wop Box - 101 More Vocal Group Gems"", other than that, I don't believe anyone has put out a CD from the master tapes as of yet."
5,Slide Guitar Master,"Sam Mitchell's playing is a throw back to the simpler musical life we enjoyed in the late sixties. His clean performance of the great slide tunes of the 20th Century make this CD a classic. If you play slide guitar at all, this is a must have for your collection. Stephan Grossman, the guitar educator, has devoted almost half his Slide Guitar book directly from the tunes on this CD (tab and notation both). A new Sam Mitchell album has justed been released (Oct'00) so keep you eye out for that one also."
2,I looked so forward to it ... but,"It is the slowest dullest movie to hit the screens in recent times. Kidman plays an Interpreter working at the United Nations who overhears an assination plot. From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African. The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building.I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard. Definitely one viewing is enough. Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend. Assume it was because nothing else was on."
3,Script Needs Work,"The Interpreter is an extremely packaged political thriller that contains only a little punch. Unfortunately the good acting can't overcome the weak script. I felt like the story was still a 2-3 drafts short of being ready for the screen. The biggest problem was that there are plot holes you could drive a truck through. I also felt the movie dragged through most of the middle as they tried to develop the strained relationship between the principle characters. If you are a plot-driven movie fan, as I am, the movie is likely to be a disappointment.Even though ""The Interpreter"" was enjoyable the ending was definitely a disappointment. It wasn't that it was necessarily wrong, just that you knew what was coming."
2,Sean Penn is off this time,"Sean Penn is a very talented actor. So talented that I willingly laugh off his incredible arrogance. In ""The Interpreter,"" though he seeems to be just a little bit off his game. Everyone seems to be just a tad uninterested in the preceedings, and I share the feelingThis thriller moves at a plodding pace. I wasn't engaged at all. It's not a terrible film by any means, but considering my level of anticipation, and the film's pedigree it was a considerable disappointment."
3,Interesting story,"Excellent performance by Sean Penn. Good acting by Nicole, but nothing brilliant. The plot was very confusing and by the end I still was not sure of the actual villian. Beginning scenes too violent."
3,Good but...,Overly detailed and a bit confusing. Still it's good to see intelegent filmaking's still being made. I'd wait for the dvd.
4,thriller and suspense,"I'm not one for thriller movies, but I like this one. I got jumped a few times but it's short times and the scenes fit well to build up the climax. The conclusion of resolutions was pleasant too."
4,"great film, no special features on bluray","The bluray quality was excellent, both in terms of video and soundtrack quality. One disappointment was that there were *no* special features on the bluray disc. I have to wonder why the disc authors chose to omit the extras available on the standard dvd release."
4,Great entertainment,"Just watched this with a couple family members and it was a great night's entertainment. Several times during the film we stopped it to kind of catch each other up on the details and hash over what was happening - great fun! Acting was wonderful and we appreciated that people didn't casually end up in bed with each other. Loved the mix of reality with the actual U.N. building, broad social justice themes, and personal psychological work that went on. Definitely worth watching."
2,Ridiculous Ending Spoils Good Movie,"Seldom has an ending been so disappointing and ruined a good film as this one.For most of the way, this was a slick thriller, nicely photographed and nicely acted. Sean Penn is outstanding in here. I like to see him play low-key characters instead of hot-headed sleazeballs. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Sometimes her classic beauty hides the fact she can act.The story was pretty involving, hard to put down once you've started. My only complaint up to the ending was the obvious plug for the United Nations. This looked a public relations piece for that organization.However, then came that ending - a real insult to anyone's intelligence. In a nutshell, nobody would go the extremes they went to here to protect a visiting dignitary, using all that manpower and machinery....and then leave him all alone in a room at the end! Are you serious??? It was unbelievably stupid and ruined what had been an entertaining and somewhat- smart film."
3,Interesting but predictable at the same time,"Nice set-up about an interpreter in the UN overhearing Africancoup attempt and inclusion of awareness about genocide, but a fairly predictable script. Some intelligent moments and twists,but also a fairly predictable parallel relation between Kidmanand Penn, and a bit too many sad eyed scenes. The audiencecould guess a lot of what is to happen, and Penn's opening scene where he drops his wedding band into an empty booze glassis nice symbolism, but really gives away easily everything about this character. Ending a bit melodramatic. Take a pass unless you're bored."
2,"Someone should ask, Why?","The underlying plotline is an interesting one; a dictator (or any politico) deflecting heat by making the world witness a reason to feel sympathy for him. However, the entire line of the story having to do with the interpreter, played by Nicole Kidman, does not make any sense.Assuming the bad guys could set her up to overhear the conversation, what would have happened had she reached Pierre and found out her brother was indeed already dead, ergo he could not have anything to do with the plot? Would she take the issue further? Why would she ... where was her motive?Even if you buy into all the improbabilities to do with the interpreter, why would the Secret Service make her a target of investigation?Also, and the capper for me, why would the dictator's henchmen want to kill her ... or, in the alternative, assume they wanted to kill her, why get into her apartment, steal a ceremonial mask, and then stand on the fire escape to scare her??? Why?"
2,Dull,"Despite a terrific performance by Sean Penn, and a decent one from Nicole Kidman, this movie didn't move me. It manages to be both dull and improbable. There's a lot of Screenwriting 101 in it, stakes raised in a way that, unfortunately, feels very artificial. It also seems quaintly nostalgiac in its depiction of the UN. The founders of the UN might have fantasized it would work like this in 2005, but it doesn't.It's diverting enough if you've seen everything else, or if you are a fan of the stars. But keep your expectations low."
2,Great Actors In A Boring/Bad Movie,"I give it two stars for the theme of the movie and plot which is unique! Unfortunately, I had watch this movie at two different times in order to ""get into it."" I couldn't help but fastforward the last 30 minutes because I just wanted it to be over with!!! If no one screened this movie before it was put on DVD, it shows! I'd rather watch tv than this movie!"
2,A smart intelegent but very slow drama that tries to be suspensfull,The Interpreter is a story of a UN interpreter played by Nicole Kidman (who is very boring in her role and has no life) who hears an assisanation atempt on a African leader. Sean Penn( who is very borng) is investagating the plot. The movie has a good idea and is very smart and intelegent at times butt he satory drags on and on and on. the movie tries to be a suspens film but it dosent work there is only maybe 3 parts that are good. The movie started out good but went downhill fast. Overall the performances where bad and I love Nicole Kidman but this time she did not turn out good and the story was slow.
3,So many names...,"Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack... they could've created stronger film especially the end of it."
3,solid performances by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn,"Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie. So, secret service agent Tobin Keller, played by Sean Penn (Mystic River, The Assassination Of Richard Nixon), whos wife just recently died, is on the verge of believing her and not. Nicely constructed action/thriller with some pretty good moments, one being a bus conversation and then it explodes. Also starring Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal), Jesper Christopher and Michael Wright (Money Talks, Pinero). Probably one of the only good movies that has come out so far besides Sin City and Crash."
3,"A film that settles for being ""good for you"" rather than actually ""good""","""The Interpreter"" is intelligent, well intentioned, and stylish but unfortunately lacks an involving narrative and characters one truly cares about. Maybe it's shallow of me, but I really think this movie needed a little more ""punch"" and good old entertainment value. In the end, the film is watchable and interesting (and its dialogue about human rights issues is certainly honorable) but it could have been a lot more. Fans of sterile, more intellectual thrillers will likely be more forgiving, but I personally like my thrillers to be more, well... thrilling. The DVD features a crisp, clean widescreen image and generous extras that flesh out many of the issues discussed in the film."
3,Great elements can't make for a troubled script,"Pollack is a steady hand at the helm of this movie with rock solid pro performances from a great cast. Unfortunately its the script that ultimately sours this political thriller. It becomes quite obvious soon into the film ""who"" the bad ""guys"" are with simple deductive reasoning. Pollack had a choice of either cluing we the viewers in on who the enemy is or instead keep it a mystery until the films climax. Sadly he chooses the latter. Instead of watching the bad guys plotting their next move Pollack decides to make us guess. We've all seen enough of these movies to guess pretty much right all though this film. I would still however recommend this movie but only as a rental and not one for the collection. PS definitely not for children, there is a brutal killing (which will be no surprise) at the films opening scene."
3,Average entertainment,"If you haven't seen it yet, you sould be warned that it isn't worth buying. Here's why :- It is quite long and very predictable (audiences who like surprises or suspense will definitely be disappointed)- Even if she is a very talented actress, Nicole ""Chanel 5"" Kidman is out of place in the middle of an African guerrilla."
3,solid performances by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn,"Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie. So, secret service agent Tobin Keller, played by Sean Penn (Mystic River, The Assassination Of Richard Nixon), whos wife just recently died, is on the verge of believing her and not.

Also starring Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal), Jesper Christopher and Michael Wright (Money Talks, Pinero). Probably one of the only good movies that has come out so far besides Sin City and Constantine. A fun ride."
2,"Poor Storyline: Skip It, Save Time","The cast is good, but the story is very weak, a teenager could have written it. Often cheesy as well. Moreover, it's hard to believe DSS will retain such an employee who is going through serious personal issues. One can't blame the technicians if the design itself is crappy. This is a crappy movie, despite the top tier cast, simply because the story was not properly set."
2,Slap logic in the face,"We suspend disbelief all the time. But the ending is plain insulting. That a character could hide, as suggested here, just ruins the movie."
1,Brutal,"This might have been the first movie filmed inside the UN, but one can only hope that UN is not as stupid as the movie portrays it to be. The security checks were twisted. On the one hand, the entire UN building was evacuated because of a faulty metal detector and on the other hand, when it was known that a killer was in the building, security simply allowed the conference to continue. Sydney Pollack is a very intelligent individual, but here he lost his head once he realized he could film inside the UN.Overall, I think the movie was pointless as it simply highlighted what we already knew. A lot of innocent people are being killed in Africa. A better alternative would be to watch the Lord of War. In there, at least, they make a mockery of what's happening in Africa."
1,This was the worst movie I saw in 2005,"How can a movie directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Sean Penn go wrong? If you watch this movie, you'll quickly find out. Or, you can take my advise and spend those 2 hours (which feels like 4) and do something else - anything else. The suspense was non-existant, the action was minimal, and the storyline and dialogue were ridiculous. I actually got up from my seat after the credits began rolling and started laughing.I normally don't take the time to add to the amazon review bank, but with this film, I felt obligated to offer a word of caution. How someone could recommend this movie is beyond me."
2,Not too great,"I thought the plot line was OK. No great, but OK. I agree with other posters about the logic of the whole thing, but I won't get into it since they've already discussed that.I did expect better acting performances from Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman. They did not seem comfortable in the roles, and I was left wishing the casting director had picked different actors for the roles."
3,The Interpreter,"Kidman and Penn, what a great idea (truly) to have them together. But. Throw together a plot that is so plodding and boring and convoluted my husband had to wake me up on the sofa. This film had a few good and interesting scenes, it just took forever to get through."
2,Misses its mark -,"I went to see this film hoping to see a riveting, suspense thriller. While the idea behind the story had a great deal of promise the film comes across as sluggish, not well edited and the characters are too grandiose.As the film chugs along it always is trying to be like a ""Classic Movie"" you'd see on AMC/TCM and it loses itself. It could have been a great move if it was just written and directed more for the ""here and now"". Instead it tries too much to be like a ""Classic"" and just misses its mark"
1,Political Thriller ?,If you believe that The United Nations is the only answer to all the wrongs in the world you will love this movie.Typical Hollywood pro UN propaganda.I should have known this before buying it.
1,Lackluster slow snoozer zzzzzzzzz,"Sean Penn comes off as a real doofus in this film. Is he asleep throughout? Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable. We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller. Hello? Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!!I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance. He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character. He's not even believable as the grieving widower.Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted. No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something. I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill! The bus scene was THE highlight of the film. The Interpreter is surely not in the class of ""Three Days of the Condor"", ""Ronin"", or even ""Bourne Identity""."
2,Enough with the politics.,"This movie would have recived a four star review if it were not for some obvious political slants in the movie. After watching the movie one might conclude that the U.N. is gods gift to civilization. It was laughable that this movie criticized the lack of U.S. involvement in the "" world court "" and yet many of the members of the U.N., if there was justice in the world, would be sitting in the same court,, as DEFENDANTS. It is unfortunate that a decent movie must have its good name tarnished for the sake of making a political statement, albeit a foolish and ignorant one at best. Whatever happened to movies that didn't insult the viewers intelligence?"
1,"stupid,stupid,stupid",This is the worst film I saw in the past 10 years[and I watch about 7 per week].What a waste of time.
1,What was the point of this boring film?,"The Interpreter starring Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman, and the annoying Catherine Keener is such a disappointment to me. I was expecting a classy thriller, what I got a watered-down, pretentious 2-hour bomb. I like Kidman but when was the last time she did a movie that was actually good?! And what is so great about director Sydney Pollack? He is highly over-rated.Avoid this disaster, you will be fast-forwarding this one to end just to see the pointless and stupid ending."
1,UN PROPAGANDA,A piece of UN propaganda that Sydney Pollock got special permission from beseiged leader Kofi Anon to film in the UN . Pollock even admits he wrote the script as he filmed the movie and it shows .
1,a stinker,"its true with directors as well as actors, as actor tracy said, when you reach a point the money rolls in, you stop acting, it can fit directors too, he should have seen all the flaws in this, thanks for your early works sydney..............."
2,terrible manneristic acting,The story is fine but I find the acting terrible. Sean Penn has just one facial expression throughout: a solemn wrinkled forehead and dead pan. Kidman keeps forever getting her hair to cover her right eye. These mannerisms drive me nuts.
3,Somewhat interesting,"This was film was half bad. It wasnt anything special or great, but it kept my interest throughout. It seemed believable and plausable, the characters, for the most part felt realistic. The plot was somewhat confusing and overblown though. Its not very suspenseful nor is it very mysterious, but all in all, it wasn't terrible either. Its just one of those films that you can watch, and say OK, and just move on. Its forgettable."
3,Good One,This is a high three!!! I thought Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman played good roles in this...great storyline also.I am not sure if this recieved any great awards. If you get a chance rent this one...it is worth seeing!!!
2,Bad interpretation.,"THE INTERPRETER was well-acted and pretty to look at, but the story was incomprehensible and vague. I'm still not entirely sure what the heck happened, to be honest. Sean Penn's character is given a ridiculous backstory. The centerpiece bus scene took about 5 minutes too many to set up. And the ending was a dud.My friend Black and I tried our best to discuss it last night, but there wasn't much to discuss.""Could you figure out what was going on?"" Black asked me. ""I got lost in it really early, and I still don't know what happened.""Though I'm not exactly sure happened in the film, with its one to five assassination plots explained away while the pacing seemed so slow, I am sure it was not as well-done as it could've been. The movie needed more time inside the UN, a more coherent plot and a lot more Catherine Keener."
4,Satisfying interpretation,"The actors selected for this film and the excellent writing, directing, editing and plot development make this flick a great choice for those who enjoy both action and intrigue. Major plot avenues are fully travelled and definition and complete attention are still given to fine details. Character development, coupled with suspense, make the film and edge-of-your seat experience. If you enjoy films like The Bourne Identity and The Firm, you will definitely like this movie."
2,Rent before purchase,"Cons outweigh pros: slow-moving pace, not a lot of thrilling action, unbelievable plot holes, forgettable, Kidman's accentPros: Sean Penn's anguish, Catherine Keener's character has some good oneliners.Cons = Can't imagine wanting to see this movie more than once."
2,Not the Typical Tale,"The illustrations for the version of Jack and the Beanstalk are wonderful, however, the text is from a 1807 version and is difficult to read easily. This is compounded by the fact that it is in rhyme so some of the words/grammer are really strange to keep the rhyme pattern."
5,Perfect!,"Received shirt within a weeks time, the colors are bright and it fits perfect (not to tight and not to big). BEAUTIFUL!! Thanks so much!"
5,classy,"Extremely classy doo wop. Great harmonies, great guitar, fine material. Greatly influenced the Impressions,among others. If you like this kind of music, a real find."
1,"It does not work, tech service is no good.",I spoke to a tech for over one hour. It still did not work. I sent email explaining my problem in detail. They tell me to do the same thing over and over again. I just received email from 321 studio saying they solved the problem. Go on line a download the latest version 3.0.5. I did. It still does not work.They no longer answer may email.Will I get my money back?
2,can't copy movies over 120 minutes,"ok whih movies under 120 minutes, sent email for support, no reply 5 business days later."
1,Beware!,"Beware of 321 Studios ""Unconditional Money Back Guarantee"" ads on their website. There is a time limit and a bunch of conditions that they don't tell you about until you try to get a refund. I tried to get a refund after their software did not work as advertised but was unsuccessful."
4,Working fine so far....,"Got this product in December and have only had a few minor problems. Backed up 45 of my dvds with only 1 disk being bad. (for some reason it decided to finalize the whole cd) But 45 out of my 46 attempts to back up my dvds were successful.My computer is a 2Ghz/512 RAM/ and Sony-510A dvd-burner. But I've heard that this software is not compatible with everything.The program first reads the dvd which takes anywhere from 22 to 47 minutes. Then insert blank dvd and it'll write it in no time. The 'backup' dvd is very good quality, hard to notice the difference."
3,Fit one DVD to one DVD-R,"Of course, you should only back up DVD movies you already own.Think of this as a single package that does what DVD Shrink (or Smart Ripper) and Pinnacle Instant Copy do together: you can copy DVD movies and fit each original dual-layer DVD onto one DVD-R media. Speed is good, and the final product is watchable.Three stars because 1) sometimes a copy process will fail for no reason, and 2) it does not burn VCDs (for that you have to buy 321's DVD Copy Plus program, which is expensive).321 does offer a 30-day MBG."
1,only 1 successful backup out of 5 tries,"4 out of 5 times I get a ""read error"" spit out by xcopy xpress. Also, sometimes I get a Windows error ""dvd xcopy xpress has an error and will be terminated..."" (and that happens after 99% copied !) It's not my machine (a pretty decent system in which everything else I do on it works great), it's just crappy software.What a waste of money."
2,DVD Copy Express,"This product is good if does what it is suppose to. My dvd copy works but my express failed to open, repeated uninstall and install with force aspi did not solve the problem. I have no conflicting driver know that would block it. Their support is available but no use."
1,Waste of $$$$,"This is a Beta product at best....more buggy then most of Bill Gates releases....If you really want to buy it, wait a year or 2 till they get it right."
5,A great product,"Before I purchased this product I was worried that it wouldn't work, or that it would be hard to use. But I went ahead and bought it anyways after about 3-6 months of contemplating.I would like to say this is one of the best investments I have made in a loooong time for my computer.This product is so easy to use. And it works! I read a review saying that it doesn't copy over 12?? min. well it did for me.The only problem I have had with the software is I tried to copy ooops I mean ""back up"" Jackass The Movie. and it wouldn't let me. That is the first time that has happened to me since I had this software an I have only had this software for a week.But other than that I have been able to ""back up"" all the dvd's so far that I wanted to ""back up"" ;)"
3,Point and Click Pretty Easy,"Right out of the box I had to download the lattest version before I could backup an entire dvd. It took a couple days to get through to a server. E-mailed tech support and got an answer the next day that their server was having trouble. When backing up an entire dvd you will notice some quality loss. You can't make a backup from the backup, I also had some backups that would play sometimes and not the next. I stopped using X copy express and now use DVD Shrink. It's not point and click, but it is free."
5,Works Perfectly,"I bought a hard copy online, and installed the disk, version 2.5.1. I had several problems, and could only copy one movie after several attempts. I went to dvdxcopy.com and installed the latest version, 3.2.1, and it worked flawlessly for me, I have copied several dvds, with ZERO problems. Well worth the money."
4,Easy as 1...2....(there is no 3),"insert DVD to ""backup"" press startwhen thats done, insert blank media then press start againand voila! that's it!the only thing i don't like about this is the lack of actual control the user has over what happens. After backing up your discs when you go to play them, instead of the FBI warning that you would get in th original, you get a 321 warning screen that tells you you are watching a backup. I already know i am watching a backup. I have tried to change the actual VOB file in the temp directory to a THX trailer and when you mess with the files, the program will error and shut down.I say 4 stars because of it's ease of use, if they would let me configure it the way i wanted and put what i want on the DVD then by all means it would get 5 stars!!!!!"
4,Very informative,"Everything you ever wanted to know about the Remington 700. If you have any questions that need answering this is the book for you. From an author who is an avid hunter and gun collector, his research is supurb."
4,Hezekiah Walker= god's blessing,"This album will remind you of how good God has been to you. Just take a listen and you will see what I mean. To Hezekiah, keep doing God's will; keep creating music that touches the soul. Some of my favorite songs are 1, 4, 6 7, 10 and 12. Btw,five takes a little getting used to but you'll like it."
4,Could have been better,"I Am a true hezikiah walker fan and this album sure did bring back some memories. Even though I gave the album four stars, this is not his best work. Anyway You Bless me should not have been done over because the song is not that old and the original sounds a lot better on live in newyork. The choir's octave range is not really shown like it is on previous songs like power belongs to god and jesus is my help. Overall this album is good and should be in every believer's collection. On his next album I hope Monique Walker leads a song because without the presence of her voice the album seems empty."
4,A good visit with old familar friends,Pastor Hez does it again. It was nice to hear him revisit some of the songs from the other CDs by this group. Its inspirational and the kind of cd you can just leave in and listen to. Very nice.
3,Well!!,"Well, This album was real cool, Pastor Walker brought back some of the old songs from his earlier albums. I enjoyed Kim Burrell, Pastor John P. Kee, Timinny,and Kervy's guest appreances. They all really blessed my heart. ""If you get this, you will not be able to stay still."""
5,Hezekiah Walker is a man of the word,"This album touches ones heart, and brings in the convicting love of Jesus."
3,Old stuff over again,"Again I must keep this review short and sweet. I was not really happy with this project. Most of these songs have been done pleanty of times and some were even on old projects Hezekiah himself. I was looking for some more new stuff. But I must say that ""I need you"" is a great song and I love it a lot. But overall I thought that it could have been better."
3,Second Time Around,"Personally I enjoyed the CD immensely. Especially, The Lord Will Make A Way Somehow, from the old tape when I first listened to that song I was like a child in a candy store I kept wanting more of the the song because during that time I was going though something and whenI listened to that song it was an ease to my pain. Hezekaiah Walker is a very talented artist and some of the songs I may not jump to when it first comes on but when the old ones start I just shake my head to say ""my boy is back a second time singing the praises to Our Most High""."
4,Anointed,"I was there when this album was recorded, the concert was great and so is this album. Every song is uplifting. When ever I feel down or need some inspiration I put this CD in. Enjoy."
5,A real jewell,"The set (CD & DVD)is a real jewell.The CD offers tunes covering the wide music spectrum of Mitch Woods: Boogie, Blues, Ballad, a wonderful Mambo, including instrumntal tracks (particularely ""New Gert Town Blues"". The contribution of ""extra musicias"" has to be hilighted, perfectly in line with the wonderful musicians of Mitch's Band.The quality of the record is perfect.Th DVD offers very intereting sequences about the practice of the musicians before recording as well as exceptional interviews of Mitch and musicians.This set is ""mandatory"" for Mitch'Fans and necessary for everyone who loves such a music."
3,Great Author,"Got this book expecting it to have the one poem I like from Whitman and sadly it didn't. It was an old copy too but in a really good condition, it's gonna look great in my private library"
2,Very disappointed,"The person saying the words is saying them too fast, and gives no time for me to repeat more than once. I don't know of which set of words she wants me to repeat in matching them of what she said. The book does not match the CDs, therefore, I cannot see what she is telling me to say. There is no opportunity to write the words down phonetically, so I can pronounce them as she says them. If I could get my money back, I would ask for it. I have had these CDs since June and I am still on tape one. The odd thing about it, the language does not apprear to be difficult if time for each phrase or word is given to repeat. Only in the way it is being delivered makes it difficult to repeat or just to say."
5,Sounds very interesting!,The Language Lab: Japanese sounds very interesting! I am learning Japanese by myself. It is a lot of fun! The reason I want this package is because the phrase book teaches you Japanese dialects. I would love to have this package!Gambatte kudasai!
3,Space Aliens or Martial arts?,The dialog reads like a B movie men in black.The martial arts scenes through out the movie are pretty good:better than the plot or acting.The British government has a captured alien of one kind and is working with aliens of another kind. A rogue British army special unit tries to sellthe suppressed alien file to the highest bidder.Both the aliens and the British government send in reinforcements...Such a lot of kick boxing in slow motion results.
5,"If you love oldies, you'll love this!",This is an often forgotten group of singers from the 50s and 60s who never should be forgotten. They have excellent vocal harmonies and the lead singer's sobbing and crying while singing is a lost art! I was so excited when I found this CD at Amazon. Keep stocking great oldies like this one!
2,Teeth whiteing Gels,This product is not working like the one I receive at the dentist office IT's now 4 weeks and no resultuse-in every day no changes from where the last product stop.Jervis
4,Effective and lasts a long time,"After spending $200.00 for treatment at the dentist, I decided to go with this. Have used for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly tell you that Watts Power White 35% works very well. I am still not done with the first syringe and expect this to last for at least 6 months. Curiously, it does not burn the gums as severely as the 20% that the Dentist provided to me. Highly recommend this product for price, quality and overall value."
1,fast shipment slow results,does not work as indicated. claims to be 35%but i have used this for 2 weeks twice a day and very little has changed. the directions indicated was strong and not to get on gums the 20% i got first from the dentist was stronger.
3,teeth whitner,"as far as the teeth whiteners I have tried....this is just okay. I will not get it again, because I have found one that is better and faster"
3,"Tea great, Shipping problematic.","Since Amazon.com is ignoring my questions, I will take this as an opportunity to say - tea great, shipping problematic. Bekunis tea bags and instant tea great for constipation swears my grandmother. I bought both and Amazon shipped the products separatly - so shipping cost more than the product."
5,Love it!,"I received this diaper bag as gift for my baby shower. I absolutely love it! Obviously, I am having a girl, and believe me, you can't get anymore girly with this bag. It has ton's of space, comes with a case for the wipes(it's a bit cheap, but I did'nt get the bag for this case!) and also a bottle holder. For the price, it's an awesome bag. I started filling it up to prepare for Katelyn's arrival, and I was just looking for stuff to fill it up with, that's how roomy it is. Lot's of compartments. I highly recommend this bag if you're having a girl, you just might want to get a more masculine bag for the hubby to carry on days when you're not around!"
1,not like the picture,I ordered this because I was attending the Barbarian themed weekend at the Renaissance Festival. It did not fit correctly and ripped when I tried to tie it. Had to return to Amazon
5,DEGREES OF OBSESSION - A MUST HAVE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely loved this book! This is a MUST HAVE book for anyone who loves romance and suspense. The author does an exceptional job in keeping the reader on the edge of their seat. Once I started reading, I could not put this book down. I would highly recommend this book! It's a fantastic read!!!!!!!"
4,I never knew he had it in him..,"I was delighted to receive this book as a Christmas gift from my mother (today!) and read it cover to cover immediately. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and what amazed me was that John had all of this raw emotion in him and I never knew it. I delighted in reading about 'neighborhood' things, as I grew up in the same neighborhood and shared similar (though possibly less obscure) experiences. I'm pleased for John that he has published and found his niche, and wish him continued success."
4,Nice Sampler disk,"What we have here is a nice little sampler ofacknowledged big band greats. With names likeArtie Shaw, Benie Goodman, Duke Ellington andseveral others, one is assured of quality soundsand mellow moods. I can't complain about theselections, only to say that the cd clocks in at37 minutes and could easily have held twice asmuch, thus providing a more lasting and comprehensiveexperience (hence only four stars, the mucis is 5).You can snag many samplers like this off of Amazonfor just a few bucks and its certainly well worththat."
3,"I like Carcass, but...","Lets just say the band got much, much better after this effort. Fermenting Innards stuck out, and that track was rerecorded later and sounded much better. While murky production may work for Black Metal to an extent, in this case of Death Metal, or Grind Core it does not. Buy this album if you are trying to finish your carcass collection, get Symphonies of Sickness or Heartwork if you're checking out the sound of the band."
4,The first gore/grind album ever.,"Carcass started a whole new genre with this cd, gore/grind. Carcass plays sick down-tuned guitars, high speed drums, and guttural grunting vocals. Most of the songs on this cd are fairly short. The production isn't very good, and it does sort of take away from the music. Carcass doesn't really compare to todays gore/grind bands, in terms of brutality atleast. This cd is brutal, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't reach the intensity of some of the newer bands. My biggest problem with this release is that it's very grind oriented with only a little gore mixed in. I am a bigger fan of their second full lenghth ""Symphonies of Sickness,"" which contains longer songs, more technical guitar and drumming, but less brutality. After these two cd's Carcass lost most of it's grind style and turned into much more of a death metal/thrash metal band."
1,Perverted brains !,"Horrible songs. The sad part of it is that this guys can play metal, but tried to choose a fast wat to success writing disgusting rotten and ridiculous lyrics (I think they have realized this is not the way to success). Horrible!"
1,go buy swansong instead,"this album showcases carcass at their most DUMB, IMMATURE, and MESSY state fo their career. even the band themselves denounce this album later.this album REEKS. literally.swansong or heartwork had way better riffs, huge solos, better drumming, better lyrics, better everything.go get swansong or even heartwork, carcass' first 3 lps are not worth your money."
5,A small work that contains much,This is a small book but it contains much Torah wisdom on the subject of prayer.
2,Urine off cat and kitten stain and ordor remover,"I used this on a carpeted rug that could not be washed in the washer. I used as directed and was not able to remove the odor. I wonder if it works better on certain types of rug materials. In any case, it did not work very well for me."
2,gave me a heat rash,"i want to love this stuff, it gave me a great tan, but it also gives me a bad heat rash every time i use it. i'm not a dermatologist, but i think the cause is clogged sweat glands. i used it two years ago, got a bad heat rash, tried it again this summer, and the same thing happened."
4,good EC swing practice disc,We are new to ballroom dancing and were looking for swing music that was slow enough for us to dance to. About half the songs on this disc fit that description.
4,Reducing Stress-related Behaviours in People with Dementia: Care-based Therapy,"Good read and extremely helpful for dealing with dementia patients. Changed our attitude and approach toward the patient because as a result of this book, understand the disease more."
5,YPT-300 VS. YPT-310,"The newer YPT-310 is functionally identical to this earlier model YPT-300. The newer model changes simply made the device more environmentally friendly (""greener""). You can therefore find additional reviews of this device atYamaha YPT310 61 Full Size Touch Sensitive Keys with 500 tones and 32-note polyphony. The letters at the end of the model number, such as ""AD"", indicate bundled accessories, such as the power adapter."
5,I agree,"Diaper bags weren't meant to be purses. Purses are meant to be purses. They're meant to be what they are, a bag to hold all baby's stuff. I don't feel embarassed carrying around a babyish diaper bag and neither does my boyfreind. It just says that we're parents, and we need a way to haul their junk around.I'm sick of grey, black, RED, blue diaper bags that are supposed to be for parents. They're ugly and I perfer something my baby would like too."
4,This book is a comprehensive introduction to mastiffs.,"This book is a great for those who are unfamiliar with the Old English Mastiff breed. Although it offers the reader a wealth of information regarding the history, personality, and general responsibilities that go into owning one, I would have appreciated more elaboration on each topic. Also, I would have liked to have seen more photos, especially ones that show a comparison of dog and owner (to allow the reader to truly comprehend the sizeof the mastiff), as well as photos that include the apricot-colored coat (as opposed to just brindle and fawn)."
2,A waste of money,"I bought this book because I recently got a mastiff puppy and was looking for training tips and information on personality traits specific to mastiffs. I had already thoroughly researched the breed and have always had giant breed dogs, but this was my first mastiff. This book was useless to me... the part on training is some generic insert, non-specific to any particular breed... What a waste of money...."
5,The Aristocratic Comedy,"Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime minister are in my opinion the pinnacle of the English comedy; Classy, funny, and purely enjoyable. You will love politics when you watch this very artistic piece of fine art. You will understand politics and maybe you will end up respecting the political process and its players. This comedy fits every country and every society because every country and every society must have politics and politicians. The process is the same all over; the only thing that changes is the players. Set back, make cup of Earl Grey Tea with some biscuits, the English ones, and embrace yourself for a relaxing fulfilling comedy."
4,Interesting Read,"Although this book would not rank among the unputdownables, it was interesting enough for me to read it from cover to cover over several days. The author has struck a balance between riveting story telling and details of who-did-what-when.The title is a bit misleading as it was often not military intelligence per se that led to the blunders but the failure to appreciate or act on useful intelligence."
4,Very detailed and interesting look at history,"This book was a very detailed and interesting look into some of the most amazing military blunders in history. The author has obviously done his homework, and gives surprisingly intricate detail into each situation. He does tend to ramble on a little with his explanations, and injects a lot of theory based on the facts about why he thinks certain leaders didn't see things coming, but it's very substantiated. He also seems to hold a general dislike for the job that the United States and British intelligence services do. Maybe there's some hidden issues there."
5,Different perspective of some modern military battles,"This is a book about modern military campaigns and the military intelligence or lack there of involved. I enjoyed this book, it gives a often overlooked perspective on military battles and campaigns. It also tells some of the pitfalls of modern military intelligence and where they have triumphed and failed. There are examples from WWII, the Falkland Wars and the Gulf War plus a few more. Not all of the results can lay at the feet of military intelligence but it does give a good perspective of what didn't happen as far as intelligence was concerned and what happened because of that lack. For a different perspective and insight into well known modern wars and the often overlooked and not talked about intelligence and the mistakes they make. I give it an A."
2,Not for airplane use,"I bought these headphones for my preschool-age son to use on the airplane. My son had them on for about 10 minutes and then refused to continue using them. When I tried them on, I realized why. The headphones somehow amplify the airplane noise and drown out the sound of the movie. You would have to turn the volume of the movie much higher than appropriate for a child in order to hear it over the background airplane noise. I ended up buying an adult-sized pair of Sony headphones (about $30)that specifically eliminate background noise. The Sony pair fits my son well enough, and he will happily use the headphones on the plane for hours. If you need headphones for an airplane, skip the Califone. They should be fine for ordinary use."
2,Good headphones but not for airplane,"I purchased these headphones for my 2-year-old son to use while traveling via airplane, and like a previous reviewer, I found that the ambient noise of the airplane drowned out the sound of the DVD player at normal listening levels forcing me to turn the volume up (a lot) in order to hear it. I am now searching for better noise cancelling headphones for our next airplane trip."
4,Perfect for our kids,"We bought two sets of these to use with a dual screen DVD player we recently purchased to keep our kids occupied during a trip to the beach. They were great, seemed comfortable and fit really well on their little noggins. Actually, they're adjustable and they even fit me!"
4,fits perfectly,My two year old loves these headphones. they fit him great and the long cord is great so the headphones don't get pulled off his head each time he turns his head. A great buy!
5,Works for my 3rd grader,"Our school recently started to require the kids to bring their own headphones. I wanted to find headphones that were similar to the high-quality headphone the schools used to provide. I like the muff style, since it is comfortable to small ears and blocks out a little more ambient noise. These also have a sturdy cord. Also, they won't break the bank if they happed to ""walk away.""I was unable to test drive them before they headed to school, but I've gotten no complaints from my 3rd grader, a minor miracle."
2,didn't like,"These were not comfortable at all, and were too small for my 5 year old. We ended up getting him some adult headphonesAudio-Technica ATH M20 Stereo Monitor Headphoneswhich were a little big but very comfortable and very durable.As far as kids headphones, we really like theKidz Gear Wired Headphones For Kidsas they are much more comfortable and adjustable. They aren't as durable as the adult ones, but they worked well for car trips and such."
2,A gamers review,"I bought this game for $30.00 and I must say it was a waste of my money. The graphics were really bad, the boss battles were ok, it is way to short and to easy. The characters all have different abilities but jimmy and timmy have the same special abilities they fly, spongebob can squeeze down to fit in small places, and Danny can turn invisible to phase threw special walls.It is basiclly a shooter and there is no unlockables just it says, when you beat the game, good job you win thats it. Also it has really simple puzzles good for little kids. Over all I am a fan of these cartoon characters and I think it was a bad decision to buy but if you have a little kid who is 6-9 they will love it."
3,My review of a waste of money.,"The thing I don't like about this game is that the bosses are to easy. On most of them, you just keep shooting and shooting. Also, the graphics are pretty bad and, the real reason I hate this game is because it is way to easy. I beat it the day after I got it. I only played for about five hours and it tells me that I won."
2,"Fun, but short","This game is extreamly fun, but it only has 12 levels. The 12 levels are well designed, with lots of obstacles. They are long and som e are challenging, but my problem with it is that the levels take only 15 minutes each! So really, you get to play this game for three hours at max. On the last boss, you have an unlimited amount of lives, and every second is a check point. It's really boring playing the last boss. I could easily advise some other way better games."
4,Pianist extrordinaire,"Bill Charlap is monster jazz pianist with a wealth of ideas and flawless technique. His trio is well rehearsed and play real arrangements as opposed to just blowing through a bunch old standard chestnuts. His ballad rendition of ""Paper Moon"" is bluesy and introspective. The uptempo tunes are prime examples of swinging creativity and fun. I bought this after seeing him in concert. I believe I saw a better performance, but this is still worth the ""cover charge""."
3,Still my favorite author...,"After reading this book, which I did move heaven and earth to purchase on the day it was released, I realized that the reason it fell short for me was because of the fact that all these characters are brand new to the reader. In her previous Team Sixteen Navy SEAL books we've gotten to know the characters prior to ""their"" book. I think Suz's readers have gotten used to miles of backstory from previous books in the Team 16 series and these brand new characters, introduced in Flashpoint, simply can't compare. I do believe that the next book in this Troubleshooters series will deliver what we, the loyal reader, are used to from Suz. I will continue to rush out on release day to buy her books, pay hardback price and hide from my family until I have read said book in full."
5,wonderful audio,"I've listened to a few audio books before, but never had two readers been this good. I was easy to differentiate characters and narrators even with two readers, one male, one female. The story & dialogue were engaging enough that I didn't want to miss a word. This was an appropriate book to put on audio recording as well.This story seemed more mainstream, not like a big romance. There was more action and info on Kasbekistan and it's culture, showing the variety of people in residence, making it less like a stereotypical terrorist hotbed. Love scenes seemed appropriate to the main characters' conversations."
5,A fast dangerous ride!,"Loved this one! Exciting, fairly realistic, complex. Some reviewers have complained that there was no romance. Romance, as in candlelight? I guess that's true, but there was certainly attraction in spades. Now I think Tess would be better off with Deck, but no one asked me!The biggest flaw in the book was the lack of continuity between this book and the last. I actually checked to be sure that I hadn't skipped a book. What happened to the (nonexistent) book that detailed the resolution of the Tom / Presidential assasination attempt, and Tom's decision to form Troubleshooters? Sure, it was hinted at in the previous book, but there's a whole lot of steps between hints and a full-fledged business that's up and running. Plus Alyssa left the FBI? Sam quit SEALS? More details about how all that came about would have been very nice Ms. Brockmann.Despite what's missing from this book, what's included is fantastic, and I loved it."
4,Very Good Read,"I enjoyed this book from the beginning. The opening scene was a great introduction to the main characters and their relationship to each other, plus a good laugh. Flashpoint moves at a nice pace and held my interest throughout. The only complaint I have - - I didn't feel that I got to ""know"" Tess and Nash as well as I would have liked. However, the action was great and unpredictable. The secondary characters were also interesting. The fact that this book deals with current world issues was a plus for me. It felt fresh and timely. The best I have read in a while. Suzanne Brockmann fans will not be disappointed."
2,Suzanne wrote this?,"I am a huge fan of Brockmann's, but oh my goodness, I don't think she wrote this installment of the NavySeals. I liked the characters, but their danger and action scenes fell flat for me because of thier behavior and dialog I either wanted to laugh or encourage the terrorists to take them out for violation of good character exchange! I will still read Brockmann because there isn't anyone out there who writes like she does or makes you feel what the characters feel like she does....BUT, I just might have to wait for the next one to hit paperback instead of killing myself to get to the bookstore on the first day of release."
2,And now for something completely different,"One of my favorite features of Suzanne Brockmann's books is that she usually introduces her heroes or heroines as secondary characters in her previous novel. (what a sentence, but you get what I mean?)So here, she goes totally off the board with three characters we've never met before, have no fuzzy feelings for, and have no sense of depth for.Yeah, the love scenes are nearly PG-13 -- a most unwelcome change from her previous novels. But the worst part is that the reader just doesn't care about Jimmy and Tess.Ok, all that said, I can't wait for Cosmo's story. I still adore Suzanne's books, and hope that she is able to fight off the pod person who has taken over her body."
2,What the Heck Happened???,"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Suzanne Brockmann is my favorite author. However, after waiting months upon months for this book to come out I was so disapointed. Brockmann can drag a reader into a story better than any writer I know but this quality is sadly lacking in her newest realese.When I first found out that Brockmann was going to introduce a whole new set of charcters I was excited. These guys (although not Navy SEALs) are supposed to be the best of the best of the best. Am I the only one who wondered where these people's focus was? On a mission in nightmare of a country, all the characters could think about was who was ""getting with"" whom. Where was the gut wrenching plot? Where was the suspense that has made Brockmann famous. My only hope is that her next book (Cosmo's) will do credit to her amazing talent"
3,Flashpoint,"Why do good authors mess with perfection? Suzanne Brockmann has fallen off my ""must have immediately"" list. The love scenes in this book were flat and unemotional. I was very disappointed. I hope this book is not a portent of things to come. Other authors that have gone the same way over the years are Tami Hoag, Julie Garwood, Linda Howard and Elizabeth Lowell. Except for Garwood they were all previously ""series romance"" authors. Their original works all had detailed sex scenes without being pornographic and when they jumped to mainstream publishing it continued. But, the jump from paperback to hardcover seems to come with a price; less sex between the hero and heroine. I am an adult and I like love, sex and romance. I love books that can introduce a good suspense storyline with romantic and lusty love. Why does the writing style that made these authors my ""Keepers"" change so drastically with a jump to hardcover?"
5,Outstanding,Loved this book. I'm sorry that I did not read the series in the proper order. Its too bad that they were not numered along with the titles. I read the higher number of the books first and they finally found Suzanne's website and got the correct order to read them. Seven was a hard one to find. I am now continuting to read them or reread them in the proper order. I'm sure some things will now make better sense to me.I like the way her characters keep appearing in later books.
3,"pretty good, tess rocks","I love Brockmann's troubleshooters series and this was definitely worth reading, but not at the top of my list. I really liked Tess. She is real, tough and very smart. I found the characters independently interesting and the story was exciting. I like her stories that take place in interesting and dangerous locations. This will sound petty, but I honestly have to say that what was missing in this book was the hot factor between Tess & Nash. I liked them both but I wasnt really buying the love or the lust between them. Well, that is not exactly true....I bought that Nash loved Tess...but I wasnt feeling it overall. That said, still a very interesting book that I would recommend. I liked that she skipped the history story in this book."
4,Near Miss,"While probably not her best work, Flashpoint is still a book that I'll keep on my shelves for a re-read along with all the other SB books I've got. So I'm surprised that so many don't particularly care for it. The characters are interesting and have more depth than the average love story. All of which is to be expected when reading a Brockmann novel. Diego Nash isn't always a lovable character but his dark side contrasts well with the sometimes overly sweet Tess Bailey. Both are developed but fell short of the usual realism of a SB character.The side characters are what make it a worthwhile read. Decker, Sophia, Dave, and Murphy keep things moving and temper the over-the-top personalities of both Bailey and Nash. Overall it would have been nice to see more of the original Troubleshooters from the SEALs as this is sort of the next step in the series. Then again, it's not their story...it's Diego and Tess."
2,I have to agree with the Gigli comparison,"Suz is definitely one of my favorite authors, but what was going on when she wrote this book? I really had high hopes and expectations for Flashpoint, but I found myself not really caring about these characters about half-way through reading it. Nash and Tess were totally unlikeable and I still don't know why they ended up together. Sure, they had sex, but other than that, there was no passion or compatibility between them. By the way, blink and you'll miss the ""love"" scenes. I got the impression that Tess was only attracted to Nash because he was unattainable in her eyes. I was also miffed that Suz didn't expand further on Nash's demons and why he was so scarred. In my eyes, theres no foundation that would keep these two together for the long-haul. I must say that I loved Decker and I hope he gets his own book in the future, but not with Sophia. We don't need another Max and Gina. (...)"
4,Couldn't put it down,"I just happened to run across Suzanne Brockmann by chance and now I am looking forward to reading all of her books.Flashpoint was the second one of her books that I've read and I couldn't put it down. I found myself reading it during TV commercials, then I just turned the TV off and kept reading, and reading and reading. I was even reading it at work until I just had to finish it.This book had just enough romance to keep you going and enough suspense to keep you wondering what would happen next. I would recommend this book to all my friends."
4,A good read from a good story teller..,"Suzanne Brockmann's ensemble-cast novels are what I enjoy. Simply put....I enjoyed this book. No more...no less. I enjoyed the good read...period. Sure the sex could have been a little more ...ah..""involved"" but I still enjoyed the story. Years ago when I first started reading her books and there were jumps back and forth from WWII to present I thought ""Oh no."" But that is because, in the wrong hands, a multiple story/character line can be confusing and not interesting. For me, Suzanne you can keep doing whatever....in your hands the stories and the characters are great. You are after all a good story teller and isn't that what reading is all about....a good story. Thanks, Suzanne !"
2,Yuk!,"I have loved this series up until now. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Uninteresting characters and a slow, sloppy plot. Terrible....don't bother with this one. I'm hoping the next one is better."
3,Not Brockmann's Best,"Although this was a mildly entertaining book, it pales in comparison to most of Brockmann's work. I probably would have enjoyed it much more if it were written by someone else, but after her previous works, I guess I held Brockmann up to a higher standard. Frankly, I found the story of the secondary characters, Decker and Sophia, far more interesting than the heroes. It's a decent read, but will probably be a bit of a disappointment to true Brockmann fans."
1,Lame ...,I just could not get into this book. I can't place exactly why. Perhaps it was because there was no real character development and what there was I did not like. Nash just was not too likable - he slept with the girl of his dreams and never calls after that night. And yet he is supposed to be some amazing hero who helps save kids in an earthquake - oh whatever. I had no interest after the first 10 pages or so.
5,Another Winner!,"Suzanne Brockmann is by far one of my favorite authors. Her plots are intricate, internally and externally driven with plenty of character development. Judging from the reviews, many people were disappointed by this novel. I am not one of them. I loved the characters and found the suspense gripping. I for one, actually miss the WWII subplot, though. Keep 'em coming, Suz."
2,Flashpoint,"I have read all of Suzanne Brockmann's books regarding the Navy Seals and thoroughly enjoyed them all - so much so I hated to see them end. Flashpoint is a terrible disappointment! Being able to ""feel"" the characters is important when delving into a book - there was no depth to the primary characters of Nash and Tess - the scenes between them were really boring. There was some possibility with the character of Decker but even that fell short."
2,Disappointed,"I found Suzanne Brockmann's books last year and was thrilled to find an author that I wanted to read her books 2 and 3 times each. So, I was looking forward to her new book......but I was sorely disappointed. I couln't have cared less about the characters (except Decker) and the storyline was just a little too unbelievable. I think the author may have rushed things in order to get a new book on the shelf. I am still looking forward to Cosmo's book (he's always been one of my favorites) and will buy it the first day in hardback. Hopefully the author will flesh these characters out a little more and we can care about why they are they way they are and can hope for a happy ending for them. I couldn't have cared less when Tess and Nash got together (what a lame way to do it - sounded like somthing from junior high) and really would have gotten more pleasure from Tess telling Nash to go blow. Oh well...."
4,Read It,"#1 Reviewer did a great job giving a synopsis of the book so I'll just give my opinion of the book. It's what Suz fans can expect from her--lots of action/adventure, heat and guys you love to love. I liked Tess a lot (and the opening scene was a wonderful Suz original)but I had a problem with the fact that she was so ""nice"" that she at times supposedly liked/loved Nash so much that she would instantly forgive him or not be mad at him after he did something stupid or hurtful. Too, I wish Nash's past and the whole ""I'm a bad guy/don't deserve Tess"" thing had been fleshed out more. It seemed that we only saw a bit beneath his surface. It IS a good read, and I highly recommend it. As with all her books, I finished this one in one night. However, it's not on my Top Five list of favorite Suz books."
1,Awful dialogue !!!,"I typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out. The plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story. The writing was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish it. Phrases like ""God damn, Oh god, etc..."" were repeated over and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive. The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand. It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing. I'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin romances...."
3,These are really big corn holders,"beware, when they say Jumbo they mean really big. Too big for me. I was looking for the normal size."
4,Excellent supplement for those learning the DSM criteria,"While listing the criteria for the various disorders, the case studies and vignettes provide valuable insight into the diagnostic process. The section on "" common mistakes in diagnosis"" allow the reader to better understand the application of the criteria. Would highly recommend this book to those who are relatively new in the field and are looking for more clinical applications of the DSM-IV categories."
4,A Kid's Review,Glenn Gould has a special way of expressing Bach. He plays Bach like nothing from the Baroque time period. Not everyone likes his way of expressing but his way will certainly amaze you.
2,2 stars for sound quality,"The music itself is fine, but the sound quality is just terrible. If that's important to you, you should get another set of these concertos."
1,pretty enough but really shoddy work,"Its a pretty enough piece at a distance, however soon as i took it out of the box it was obvious how poorly it was constructed and of what cheap materials. Its very cheap looking within 5ft or so. i got 2 of them as gifts if i cant return them then i will simply throw them away."
2,Popcorn tastes like crap,"I ended up with a huge box of Orville Redenbachers Smart Kettle corn and I can tell you that if you want an absolutely tasteless popcorn, buy this one. It's horrible. It's not even the huge pieces of popped corn. Now...what to do with a large box of Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop Kettle Corn Popcorn, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 12) box of this good-for-nothing box of junk????? Hope I can send it back. Wish me luck!"
1,"Tasteless--no salt, no sweet",This popcorn has absolutely no taste. There is not one hint of salt or sweet. The only redeeming quality was that it popped well. I will be feeding this to the ducks!
1,I Found Out I Don't Like The SMART Pop. :(,The SMART pop doesn't have enough flavoring. :( I do not like it sam I am.
1,Surcalose?! Awful tasting and NOT kettle corn.,"This product has that disgusting ""aftertaste"" that an artificial sweetener gives food. I didn't know it was in the popcorn, it is only listed in ingredients. Soon after eating, however, that nasty chemical aftertaste assaulted my taste buds.This tastes nothing like kettle corn nor is it anything near what I call, ""worth the calories"". BTW, true kettle corn is made with what they call ""mushroom popcorn""."
1,I did not know the popcorn had sugar.,I did not know this popcorn had sugar since it's in the fine print and it's impossible to read it. If you buy a low calorie product why would you want to have sugar in it. I wish I could return it. The manufacturer should have made it clear - in capital bold letters - that the product had sugar.
1,Covered with OIL,"First AMAZON's Packing Box Came Opened ??? ~N~ Second Complaint This Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop Kettle Corn Popcorn, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)Product is TOTALLY:1. smeared or covered with oil; greasy: any oily road surface they could find.2. of the nature of, consisting of, or resembling oil.3. of or pertaining to oil.4. full of or containing oil.5. smooth or unctuous, as in manner or speech: an oily hypocrite.6. in an oily mannerGET The Meaning: ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OLIY ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OLIYWe Have Had This Product Before ~N~ It Was NEVER This OILY ~ NOT EVEN CLOSE ~ There Was Enough Oil in These Bags ~ That U Could Run A Aircraft Engine For Hours ~ Well ~ U GET What We MeanWe Will NEVER Purchase Any Orville Redenbacher's Popcorn Ever Again"
5,"Outstanding price and so convinient,",I love this popcorn and it's so much cheaper than in stores. With this method I never run out. It comes right to my door.
2,"All Alone, Has No Hone...","After the Mole Show debacle, The Residents (temporarily) changed for the worse. The Big Bubble (their worst recording of all time) and the 13th Anniversary Tour were the results of the ""band"" regrouping. Anyone familiar enough with The Residents phases and sounds can easily figure that a number of the original foursome flew the coop after the Mole Show. The lone survivor took it one the road. Flat, bland, and one dimensional, this recording shows the remaining Resident (now known as Mr. Skull) trying to regroup. Fortunately, with the discovery of new sounds, styles, MIDI, and the like, the ""group"" got it back together. But ""The 13th Anniversary Show"" demonstrates that art indeed imitates life. As in the early Residents tune ""The Sandman"", here our front man is ""All Alone, Has No Hone To Edge His Knify Bone."""
2,WEIRDER THAN MOST,"This is a live album although with The Residents, one cannot tell! Between-song banter there's aplenty, but audience reaction is not obvious. Standout tracks include the magnificent Jailhouse Rock and the quirky This Is A Man's World with its cartoon character voices. I wonder what James Brown thinks of it? Their quasi-orchestral arrangements are much n evidence, along with those strangled synth sounds. Things get really strange on tracks like Coming Of The Crow and Cry For The Fire, while elsewhere there are some jazzy edges. The Residents made some of the weirdest music ever but the problem is, sometimes it all sounds the same. I wouldn't recommend his album to those who want to discover this band's distinctive sonic experiments. Rather get an album that contains tracks like the studio version of Semolina, Blue Rosebuds and The Spot (with Snakefinger)."
5,what a find!,"I was hanging out at my local Borders checking out the new 6 Degrees Travel Disc when I heard the first song by Ekova which blew me away. Instead of buying that CD, I went and found this Ekova album which I'm happy to say is consistently good throughout. She does remind me a bit of the Cocteau twins, but with much more of a mid-eastern twinge. This is upbeat, danceable and hypnotic music. I like the exotic combination of instruments (mostly real instruments, not heavy on snythizier which can get irritating) and voices -- the lead singer's voice is the real selling point here, but I have to compliment her two musicians too -- they are excellent. In fact, this is one of the best world music CD's I've heard in a long time. If you like exotic blends with a beat, you'll really enjoy this music. I'm glad I stumbled across it. As an added bonus, the packaging is very attractive not just on this CD but on all the 6 degrees Traveller's series."
4,"Grateful for ""Dust""","I added Ekova's new CD, ""Heaven's Dust,"" to my collection after learning that the band's vocalist, Dierdre Dubois, found inspiration and example in the likes of Dead Can Dance and Cocteau Twins. Akin to Lisa Gerrard and Elizabeth Fraser, Dubois' lithe and nimble voice penetrates and transports -- it serves as intrument and medium.Dubois shares her interpretation of our world and its realities through a wordless craft. By emitting sound in a state of freedom and marrying it to her bandmates' equally interpretive instrumentation, the listener gets to ""fill in the blanks.""Some songs on this CD resonate better than others, leaving room for growth on the musicians' next project. I hope to follow a prolific career with Ekova, and I look forward to more complex songs that penetrate deeper and transport farther. The CD's final piece, ""Venus And One,"" approaches such complexity and foreshadows a promising future for this band."
4,Better when new,"I actually have the Bosch B7255 - I believe it is almost identical to the 3725DVS. I can't find it on the Bosch web site, but the pad for the 3725DVS fit. When it was new it was the greatest sander I had ever used - the first clutch and through-pad vacuum. It seems very sensitive to the quality of sandpaper - Bosch sandpaper seems to last forever, others not. The pad has come off a few times. The bag droops and drags, and was sanded through early on. The 3275DVS appears to hold the bag further off. The vacuum does not appear to work as well as it originally did, resulting in less effective sanding (I have washed the bag, thinking it might be restricting the airflow)."
4,I bought it for 2 of the 3 titles included in this collection,"I purchased this to get ""Wolfling"" and ""Hour of the Horde"". These were both stories that I had read some time ago and wanted to re-read them. For whatever reason, both stories made enough of an impact that I remembered them and wanted to find them again. They're fun to read, pretty short and although somewhat light they have some interesting ideas. I very happy that these out of print stories were put into this collection and reprinted."
1,Red Wing Boots,"The picture associated with these boots shows a rounded toe, when I received the boots the toe was more pointed. I also did not reveive anypaperwork that would able me to return them"
1,A complete waste of time and money!!!,"I'm surprised this book is still in the market. The part about Lance Armstrong is purely a marketing strategy. I hate books that defame people who have worked hard to succeed and this book is such. Unfortunately, this is to be expected of a 5th-rated, 5th-wheeled, doormat, lamppost type of journalist/writer who prey on innocent victims to earn a living. David Walsh should press his luck in Vegas to bring home the big bucks instead!"
3,Good but I prefer a more classic style,"This 2-CD set is a compilation of 28 songs of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's. The voice are superb but there are too often some ""stirring"" introductions and some vocal performances inside the songs that transform these patriotic songs in a kind of Hollywood show. I prefer a more classic style for patriotic songs because it is easier to listen or to sing along when you know what will happen in the next 5 seconds. Simplicity is the key word for a good result but in this case the key word is ""complexity with vocal performances""."
1,If this is the best that can be said for Rand...,"...then she can be safely written off. Luckily, it isn't. Peikoff's presentation has all of the weaknesses, and none of the strengths, of Rand's own. Unlike Rand, it is unimaginative, devoid of creativity, and dull. Like Rand, it involves ambiguity, equivocation, absence of definition, arbitrary and unclear distinctions, the erasing or ignoring of distinctions arbitrarily and unclearly, etc. His tone throughout is one of uncritical worship, and this is the last thing that Rand's philosophy needs.Rand was a valuable and insightful intellectual, though hardly 'the greatest philosopher of all time' or even one of the top philosophers of this century. To gain the full value of her work, we need criticism and scepticism; we need precision and attention both to details and to context. Peikoff is a mouthpiece, not a thinker. His anti-scholarship is the paradigm of what those interested in the fulfillment of Rand's vision must avoid."
1,but I'm not laughing,"Ayn Rand's ""philosophy"" is a joke to most philosophers. According to the Rand cult there's only one reason for this: the academy is overrun by communists. Now there might be a small kernel of truth to this; the only place in the western world one can be an avowed Maoist and be taken seriously nowadays is the university, but oddly enough Rand and her followers share important traits with many academic marxists including a poor to nonexistent background in philosophy and an immunity to facts and logic.Rand writes philosophy for people who neither like nor understand philosophy. If you want a sort of secular theology, then by all means read Ayn Rand. If, on the other hand, you want a reasoned, philosophical defense of libertarianism, then read Robert Nozick's ""Anarchy, State, and Utopia."""
1,If this is objective then what is subjective?,"Ayn Rand seems to have forgotten the definition of ""objective"". Her philosophy spouts forth from the notion that man is his own God, that his happiness comes before all else and that the thoughts, opinions and feelings of others are inconsequential as well as to be looked down upon. Given that view her philosophy should be called ""subjectivism"" as all thoughts are subjective to how any item would effect/affect one's own personnal happiness-- not how something would be measured in objective terms in which that item would be measured from an unbiased platform. Faulty thinking that appeals to the illogical mind."
1,Several rereadings later . . .,". . . I confirm my earlier review, long ago scrolled off this page: Leonard Peikoff is not a very critical thinker. (Well, in many ways neither was Rand. But Peikoff isn't even half the _polemicist_ she was.)Wouldn't it be nice if somebody who actually knew something about real philosophy figured out what the heck Rand was trying to say, subjected it to serious critical scrutiny, and offered suggestions for improving it? The result wouldn't be ""Objectivism,"" but it might be a respectable philosophy that presented a coherent outlook.It won't happen as long as dogs like Peikoff are guarding the manger."
1,boring,"- YES, I am an advocate of the Rand ""philosophy"" and have read most of her books repeatedly.- NO, I do not need someone else to come along and tell me in 50 pages what she managed to say in one page.An heir is meant to look after the inheritance, NOT turn it into gobbledygook. Ms. Rand did really well without you Mr. Peikoff - would you just reimburse me the money I have spent purchasing your long and convoluted book please?"
1,An Ego Tripped Up,"Hi, This book, Objectivism : The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, is an exerize in free ranging and high-brow analysis. It, in my opinion, could also have been titled something along the lines of ""Romantically Selective Greed: The Philosophy of Bland Fascism"". The writing is good, in honesty Leonard Peikoff does an excellent job, but it's the subject and content of the book that really made me feel well uneasy when I was reading it. Regards, Martyn R Jones"
2,hmmmmmmmmmmmm,"For someone so beguiled by Rand's objectivistic individualism,I wonder how he justified being her sycophant boy toy.."
4,A Complete Collection of Ayn Rand's Ideas,"I found this book to be extremely valuable as a collection of Objectivism's ideas into a single, contiguous argument. Dr. Peikoff is true to Ms. Rand's original presentation of these ideas as shown in her other anthologies (Virtue of Selfishness, etc.), and one definately gets the clear impression that Dr. Peikoff is an expert in the subject. My only criticism is that at times, while strictly following Ms. Rand's arguments, Dr. Peikoff misses opportunities to clarify or expand arguments upon which Ms. Rand did not elaborate greatly (e.g. free will, music). Despite that single caveat, this is an extremely good guide to Objectivist thought."
5,A single book covering all Rand's philosophy,"Finally, a book that covers Rand's philosophy in whole - from Metaphysics to Esthetics. This should be someone's first read after ""Atlas Shrugged"" or ""The Fountainhead"". Don't bother reading other Rand until later. This book should be your base for reading other Rand. Rand is awesome, but she can not possibly lay out all the premices that underlie her conclusions in books such as ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"". Piekoff does a good job of presenting the essentials of Rand's philosophy."
3,Complete but one sided explanation of objectivism,"I read this book to learn more about Ayn Rand's philosophy that permeates Atlas Shrugged. This book did a reasonably good job of explaining Ayn Rand's philosophy. After you read it, you wil understand what it was that Ayn Rand believed.The foundation of Objectivism is clearly and persuasively explained. The concept of reason as our only means of knowledge and our senses as our only means of perception were powerfully stated. However, the conclusions about ethics and values that supposedly arise from the foundations of the philosophy were not adequately supported.If your objective is to learn what it was that Ayn Rand believed, this is a good book. If you want a book that addresses arguments against Objectivism so that you can draw conclusions about it's validity, you will be disappointed."
2,A disappointingly unoriginal presentation of Objectivism,"I have read all of Ayn Rand's published works and the works of many of her followers. Perhaps if I had not, I would have been more impressed with this book. Leonard Peikoff was appointed Rand's ""intellectual heir"" following her break with the Branden's. It would seem the primary qualification for Peikoff's position is that he be of unquestioning loyalty. The result is a truly unoriginal book. You best have all of Rand's books on hand as Peikoff does little more than refer you to her writings. Peikoff is far from the intellectual giant that Rand was."
4,Human Relations....,This book is a good way of learning how to learn about what goes on in the office or business.
3,My pets don't care for it.,"This is a pet door, easy to assemble, easy to use. I found, however, that my pets didn't like it as well as their other pet door because they couldn't see through the door. They understood how to use it, but didn't because they couldn't see on the other side like their other one. So it works well, was easy to install, but I didn't rate it highly because my pets don't use it the way I thought they would."
5,Great product for a Great price...,This is the second Magnador we have owned.The first one lasted for 10 yrs. Easy to install and reasonably priced.
3,OKAY,This product is rather flemsy but served its purpose. The clips that lock the door are ridiculous to lock. So we leave it open all of the time.
5,A really good introduction to IPE,This book demystifies IPE and presents the main analytical languages in a way that illustrates the key differences very effectively. Very easy to read. I highly recommend it if you are new to IPE.
4,mom of 4,"i purchased this bag before ended up giving it to my friend for her son . with 4 kids i couldn't get everything in. now that my kids are older i thought i would try it again because i don't need as much stuff now. i really like it i can put my sons munchkin healthflow cup in the cooler side which frees up the bottle pockets for a water bottle or 2 for myself. it doesn't look very big but it holds a reasonable amount of stuff . i carry a change of clothe for my 2 youngest and spare underpants for my 5 year old twins. i also carry a full size bottle of sunblock and off bug spray besides my diaper cream ,tylenol, nail clippers,etc.i also need to carry 3 large pull ups for my youngest and there is still some room left.great bag for a mom on the go if you only have 2 or less young children. if you are like i was when i first purchased it and i had 2 31/2 year olds , a 22 month old and a newborn it just isin't big enough."
5,FINALLY!,"My sons nick name is LT which is short for Little Train! So when my friend spotted this at babies r us i had to buy it. LT's first diaper bag was a winnie the pooh one which fell apart, i had to sew it back together! This one I prey doesn't fall apart."
5,Upstairs at the Whitehouse,"A very interesting book written by someone who worked in the Whitehouse, with insights into several Presidencies. Sometimes funny, sometimes personal."
4,Fine Looking Blu-ray,"The Olive Films Blu-rays have varied in quality, though I have yet to see one that I would call a stinker. They tend to hover somewhere in the ""Good+"" range, though recently they've come up with some really good looking transfers, such as for THE GEISHA BOY with Jerry Lewis, JOHNNY GUITAR with Joan Crawford and now FORCE OF EVIL. This disc has excellent contrast levels and image detail. Some shots are a little noisy looking, but overall the Blu-ray looks very film-like and is probably the best home video presentation to date."
3,Give This Movie a Chance,"Much has been made of this movie's anti-Capitalist stance during the era of McCarthyism. I will not debate this here. This movie is a fantastic depiction of a man's greed causing others to suffer. Played expertly by John Garfield (Gentleman's Agreement, The Postman Always Rings Twice), Joe Morse is a crooked attorney managing a numbers racket for his boss. When they decide to monopolize the numbers game in town, Joe's brother, who manages one of the numbers collection houses gets caught up in the fiasco. Double-crossing ensues as Joe tries to do right by his brother.Though this movie is mostly notorious for it's politic statement, it is also a good, quick, fast-paced noir with an overtone of Cain and Abel."
3,No Force Here !,"Force Of Evil just doesn't measure up to its press clippings. The convuluted plot lacks action and the acting of Garfield is strictly wooden. He produces no empathy for the character and can spark no chemistry with his female lead. Marie Windsor is used as a throw in and completely wasted here. Garfield delivers every line as if he's invoking some speech for the ages and the dialogue is just plain stupid. As Film Noir, it is neither good noir nor a good film and lacks the necessary force to make the grade. Overall, I will be kind and give it a C-."
4,Great Noir,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover ""Force of Evil"" is a top-shelf film transfer. It has been properly restored, even surpassing John Garfield's companion film ""Body and Soul"" -- which was and is considered more marketable. ""Force of Evil"" casts Garfield as a corrupt lawyer who faces a conscience crisis over illegal lottery operations in a dispute with his older brother (Thomas Gomez). There's an irony in the fact that the film foreshadowed the current climate of government-sponsored lotteries, with their concomitant corruption of societal values. And ""Force of Evil"" was released in 1948.- Al Hooper, Edmonds, WA"
5,Classy watch by Nixon.,"I am very pleased with my purchase. It is a beautiful watch, The Nixon - Rotolog. No complaints from me.Thank you very much for a speedy delivery.Morgan."
1,demo alert.,"this is an amazing game.when i played the demo years ago, i was blown away with its gameplay mechanics, music and story.so when i found a cheap version of deus ex on a shelf for ten bucks, i snatched it up and ran away, giggling like only a crazed fanboy would.i blazed through the beginning (which was what the demo was)and as the game and plot progressed, i was..BLOWN AWAYto realize that i'd only bought an EXTENDED DEMO of Deus Ex.o the horror that i yelled when that little 'buy now' pane came up...i now quest for the actual full verson of this amazing, amazing game.if you want to collect every bitpiece of deus ex history, get this,otherwise,buy the real thing."
1,Preview Edition? I've been deceived...,"WARNING! This is only an extended demo of the real game. And in no part of the description on amazon, of this game, does it warn us of this fact... jerks. Unless you only feel like playing the first 5 out of 16 levels, which i highly doubt, DO NOT BUY.Deus Ex is one of my favorite games of all time, so when i decided to go back and play it again, i reveled in this childhood memory and ignored the fact that in the start menu it was listed as ""preview edition"". That is until i was stopped by the ""Like this game? Buy it now."" screen... I DO! AND I THOUGHT I JUST DID! Needless to say i was furious to be stopped just before i reached my favorite part of the game, Hong Kong. I'm just thankful that my seller was kind enough to refund me for this trash is CD form."
3,the movie might be better?,"norma jean is one of the greatest bands on earth, and they have a new song on this cd so its worth the cost. as for the rest of the cd, its not so good. The Every Time I Die track is good and so is the from autumn to ashes song, but the rest is kinda weak."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Horrifying evidence that emo is the new nu-metal. The only bands/artists on this double album that don't completely blow are Andrew W.K., Buckethead, and Avenged Sevenfold."
3,Good buy for the money - Copy protection?,"So I went out and bought this album because I saw it on MySpace and heard some of the tracks on Sirius Satellite Radio. Overall a cool album and very affordable price for the content. Problem? There's a content blocking program built onto the cd. Truthfull, this is one album you SHOULD steal."
1,Album not worth the spyware it installs,"The other reviews are correct in their assesment of the music presented here. I'm writing this review to warn you that this album will install Sunncomm's MediaMax software without warning on your computer should you try to play in on your computer. Fortunately the installer crashed on my system thanks to spyware blocking software I'm running.This DRM copy protection software is difficult to remove should it infect your system.There is no warning on the CD cover or when it installs the DRM software, you only find out afterward.For this reason I give the album 1 star, the music's not bad but the DRM software being installed without your knowledge makes the risk of owning this CD not worth it.I agree with the other reviewer who said this CD deserves to be stolen."
3,not well done,"im glad i only purchased this set for one song because half of it is unintelligible screaming and roaring. not even *close* to being called music. out of both disks, 30 songs, i ended up keeping about 19 because they were the only ones with words i could actually understand."
1,terrible!,"if you like metal, save your money. this cd sucks! emo garbage and commercial metal. scary??? not even..."
2,Boca Bar Mix,Unfortunately I did not like the snack mix as much as I anticipated. I was hoping that ther would be more rice crackers instead of nuts in the mix. I will not be purchasing this product again.
4,Sizzling Hot!,"Alton J. Jones serves a sizzling hot entree of financial facts, ideas and advice. In less than 100 pages ""Evil Money Evil Credit"" will arm the curious reader with easy do-it-yourself examples that will improve your credit and financial profile.By applying a few of these examples, I was able to increase my credit score significantly in a few months and purchase my dream home with 100% financing! Thanks for keeping is simple!"
5,Blueprint to the KISS practice of credit,"WOW! Finally a reference book about what credit is and how it works written in KISS form!Excellent, short, sweet, precise, concise, complete and EASY to wrap my brain around.This personal journey helps me feel less like a self imposed victim and more like a previously less informed consumer.The FEAR factor no longer has teeth for me.Thank you Alton, for offering up the real definition of what FEAR IS:""False Expectations Appearing Real"". HOW TRUE IS THAT!Well written and well received, to say the least.C. Condit"
4,Super Mario Sunshine Player's Guide 95% Accurate.,"Generally speaking this player's guide is right on the money. Could not have completed this game without it.That said, my search for blue coins in the game was stymied somewhat by the section on Pianta Village. The numbers printed on the maps did not correspond with the list in one or two places. As I am now searching for one elusive missing blue coin, I am not sure I can entirely trust the guide to help me find it. A little frustrating.Four out of a possible five stars."
1,Too many glaring errors,"1) No pictures, which I was wanting, having read this years ago2) Mangled text, making reading difficult if not impossibleI wouldn't recommend the download even if it does cost nothing out of pocketQuoth the Raven"
2,Terrible...kindle version,"This is for the kindle version. Not the actual book: Odd bits and pieces. Much of it was unreadable due to translation errors. Missing pages, stops in the middle of a section. Don't buy."
4,Fantastic!,"Not exactly the childrens' books you were imagining... with cruel stories like Suckathumb, this book is not only hilarious, but over the top didactic. Hoffmann wrote this book because he was displeased with the ones he found... they probably didn't teach a harsh enough lesson! The only reason this isn't a five is because the pictures are missing (but you can use your imagination...)."
2,Formatting Needs reworked,"I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire at the recommendation of my daughter, who had read the book in print form and loved it. I was very disappointed that formatting had been lost in the Kindle form. The print starts about halfway across the screen of the Kindle, then doesn't have enough room to finish the line, and wraps the text (usually a single word or two) to the next line. On some pages, toward the bottom, there is print to either side, which belongs with the story on the page. The reader needs to decipher where those particular words fit on the page, to keep the flow of the story. The illustrations which go with the print version of the book, and are hilarious, are not present in the Kindle edition. If I had spent money on this, I would definitely want a refund."
1,Coupon Organizer,This is the worst coupon organizer I've ever had. You have to pull all of the coupons out of each sleeve in order to easily see which ones you have. The labels that came with it were in poor shape and leave a sticky mess. Don't buy it.
1,Don't be tempted!!!!,"This is the worst item that I have ever seen. It is awkward to use, bordering on the impossible. Trying to find any specific coupon that you may have in there is a trial. It added 45 minutes to my grocery shopping. There is very little to be positive about this thing. I would not recommend it to anyone. Not even to my ex-husband's new wife! Seriously, this is just not user friendly. An envelope with index cards would be much easier."
2,Gooey labels and not enough pockets,"The pockets on this organizer are fine - they are a good size and hold most coupons, but there are not enough pockets to hold a large number or variety of coupons. The ""labels"" that are included to mark the pockets are gooey stickers that make the pockets stick to one another. I'm not sure what's wrong with them, but they turn to goo, especially if they get warm while sitting in your car."
1,organizer,"Big waste of money. It comes with glue back tabs. The book was either very old or it had got hot, as the glue melted and the tags had to be scraped out in pieces. It is hard to find coupon in the folders because they are held tight in pockets and you can not leaf thought them."
4,Cool thing to have,"It's very convenient for frequent/regular shoppers. I just don't like the way the sleeved are styled. You stick the coupons through a diagonal slot which to me makes it awkward to remove them. That is really the only thing wrong though. Otherwise, it's great!"
1,I rarely write reviews but I feel the need to warn others....,"This is such a terribly designed product. The glue that is used to apply the labels onto the slits leaked everywhere! My entire coupon organizer is covered in a sticky goo. I have to pull the stuck-together pages apart with two hands and it leaves my hands and my coupons sticky. Also, I can't see what coupons I have (as I can with an accordian-style organizer)so I have to take all of my coupons out to fumble through them. I used this twice and it's sitting in my drawer of junk now, goo and all."
1,coupon holder,I hate it. It was a waste of money. I am not using it because it is not user friendly. Instead I am using my old torn up coupon holder.
2,"Makita LS1011 10"" Slide Compound Miter Saw","I am very displeased with my Makita LS1011. I haven't been able to cut accurately since I've had it. If you get it to cut accurately at a 90 degree angle, it will not cut accurately at a 45 degree angle. I have heard about changing to different blades. I have tried two of Freud teflon coated 80 tooth cross-cut blades. I gave it a 2-star rating because I like the looks of the saw. It looks good, cuts bad. It could use a different type of adjustment for aligning the blade with the fence. It should be a screw type of alignment instead of the four hard to get to bolts. When you tighten the bolts back down after aligning the fence, the fence might move out of adjustment. The vertical adjustment of the blade is a good example of how it should be for the fence. If I could, I would give the saw back to Mikita."
2,Better ones are out there,"I purchased my LS1011 when they first hit the market over ten years ago. I have done a lot with it but it is not a precision machine. I have always been annoyed by play in the slide mechanism which results in cutting angle errors when blade torque and bite take over the cut - even with the sharpest blade. I have learned to correct for this when setting up the cut, but it is a pain. The hold down clamp is unusable on the right fence as it interferes with the motor. (Why did they put a mounting hole for the clamp on that side?). Like all of my Makita tools it has a VERY loud motor and ear protestion is advised. The bevel tilt lever mechanism is of the ""trial and error"" design. It is relatively light-weight and easy to transport but I think the Hitachi C10FS is 10 times the saw for the price Makita is asking for this one."
3,OK but no cigar,I purchased this model about 9 years ago. It has been an alright saw but not very accurate. I also have a hard time reading and setting the blade tilt gauge. It's also very loud. That doesn't bother me too much but everytime my dog (who resides in my shop) sees me walking toward it he leaves - in a hurry. I do like the light weight however. I still believe in Makita products and would be willing to purchase one of their newer models.
3,More on the rock side of things...,"This album was a little more rock than I was ready for, but its cool. I can get with alot of the songs on here. Same old Greg. Shred'n the mess out of the guitar, but his solos don't feel very ""soulful"". (sorry, thats the best word I can think of, but you know what I mean). Gregs been do'n it so long that he can probably do it with out really putting himself in the song. The track all kinda' sound the same, but that is because GREG DID THE WHOLE ALBUM HIMSELF!!!. All instruments are Greg. A true testament to his talent, but maybe not the best thing for an album. Buy this to complete the collection, but you must buyExtraction"
5,American Pickers Complete season 1,Great Shows that I missed! Really fun to see how much money we may have thrown away in the just pile. Fun for Rednecks like me!!!!
1,Moderately Depressing,"If your idea of ""entertainment"" is to watch nondescript, middle-aged men badgering the elderly into selling possessions for a fraction of their actual value, then this DVD is for you."
1,Terrible Company. Great Show!,"If you are even thinking about buying this then you already know that the show is amazing! I absolutely LOVE it. So I'm not gonna talk about the show, I'm gonna talk about what everybody is talking about and that is the PATHETIC history channel. BEWARE!!!!! Most of the DVDs they offer are not the full season. They are using a lame advertising tactic to make you buy this DVD which costs $2 a show. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Please make them do something about this and go to the historychannel.com and write to them how unhappy you are. I read numerous other people being upset about this and it pissed me off too so I wrote to them. Please pass the word so they can fix this and give us the ENTIRE season.Now about this DVD itself, I decided to buy it because I thought this was the only season out of all offered that was complete. After getting it, I still think it's not. Very sad! :( Shame on you history channel!"
3,Fun show,"This show was enjoyable but watching more than an episode or two at a sitting wasn't as easy as some other shows.Definitely better than some other shows out there. A good comparison would be this show to storage wars, which storage wars has more characters involved so it's more involved and interesting."
4,Good Show,For anyone who has never seen this show it is a great way to learn about America's past with 2 very entertaining guys. They also show you a lot of great small towns in the US. The shipping was quick and convenient.
3,"Fun show, but NOT realistic","I enjoy watching the show, but there is no way these guys could actually make a living doing what they do. I agree with this review completely: [...]"
1,Don't purchase from mobileplanet!!!,"MobilePlanet, Inc. ,My wife purchased the disc Steno CP200 (MP500251) as a Christmas gift for me from MobilePlanet, Inc. The remote control which came with the unit did not work. I have made several attempts to contact your office by phone. I was put on hold for hours on end even though the message on play on your technical support line keeps repearing that I am first on on line. I have written several emails to your office without getting a response.I am disappointed with your service and will be posting a review of your store on Amazon. com where the equipment was purchased."
3,Display faded out,"While the product works well when it works, the display faded out after 2 years so you can't see the prompts. Nothing lasts anymore."
5,Wow-ee,"Can this guy POSSIBLY be as good as -- as he is on this CD? The first time, you listen to the words. The second and third and fourth time, you listen to his voice, which just gets better and better and better with each listen. My first thought was: ""Greg Brown's MUSICAL heir."" Not that he's anything like Greg, but he seems to have -- to quote the label, ""whatever `it' is"", like Greg does. He's not as dark or dyslexic as Richard Buckner, and his voice is rich and warm. He balances the dance of dark and lightness like a watercolorist. And look at his picture! He's REALLY REALLY CUTE! I lift my glass of spring water to him, may be have nothing but the brightest future. Old folkies, if those grandkids think folk music is dead, spring for this CD for that next gift-giving occasion, but first, GET IT FOR YOURSELF. It's musicians like Slaid Cleves is what gives Americana music its good name."
4,Broke Down,"I've been able to listen to KGSR (107.1) out of Austin, Texas on the internet at work for about a year now and they frequently play the song ""Broke Down"" by Slaid Cleaves. I finally ""broke down"" and bought the cd over the weekend and now wish I would have bought it sooner! I think the record epitomizes the nice country/Texas rock sound KGSR plays."
4,Truly Excellent,"Slaid Cleaves' Broke Down is the finest album I've heard in some time. It's a combination of strong melodies, haunting lyrics and simplicity that recalls Freedy Johnston, a more tuneful approach to themes on Springsteen's 'Nebraska' and Steve Earle's work on Guitar Town. The title cut and 'One Good Year' are so strong that they could carry the record alone, but there's more. The lament of 'Horseshoe Lounge,' the despair of 'Cold and Lonely', and the confidence of 'Bring it On,' bear multiple listnings. 'Lydia' sounds like it could've been lifted off a Freedy Johnston record and Slaid's version of Woody Guthrie's 'This morning I was Born Again' offers hope among some of the tougher tunes. ""Key Chain"" brings to mind Carl Perkins -all in all great listening. My only reason for not giving the CD five stars is that I find after one or two listenings I skip over the story-in-a-song Breakfast in Hell. Still, my advice is run don't walk to get this CD."
1,A Total Sham,"Shame, shame, shame on the producers of this album. It is a total sham. There are NO music boxes on this album. The sound is POORLY synthesized. I feel really cheated by having purchased this album as it is NOT what it purports to be. DO NOT BUY! You will be very disappointed with the poor quality of sound."
1,Real Junk - False Advertising,"Poorly recorded CD, very misleading. Only clocks in at 32 minutes playing time, doesn't even sound like a music box. Shame on MCA for releasing this junk. I gave this to my son for Christmas and we were all disappointed.Check out Rita Ford's ""A Music Box Christmas"" for some real and great sounds."
4,Some was sheer heaven!,"The Abbey de Belloc was heavenly! I'd want this for my last meal! It was THAT good! I'm not a Camembert fan, but I did enjoy that too. The goat cheese was nothing I couldn't buy in the supermarket, so I was a little disappointed in the chevre. Personally, I wish they'd have kept the little knife and the petits toasts and added a little more cheese. The only gripe I have is that the pouch that's supposed to keep things cold leaked and ruined my tabletop!! So throw that out as soon as you get it!"
2,not green,"The cheese is great - the packaging is out of date. The problem is the cheese ships in styrofoam, which is a petroleum based product that cannot be recycled and is a major source of ocean debris. Thus, this product, although delicious, is non-sustainable because of its packaging. For those who care about the environment, look to other sources for cheese. I will."
1,ignores the concepts of rationality and tradition,"This book ignored the fundamentalism that traditional Christianity established and tries to redefine how it should be presented to those unwilling to take it seriously.Webb-Mitchell follows the shameful tradition of manipulating the word of bible to phrase his own opinion of how others should worship.Filled with meaningless euphemisms and anecdotal explanations, it is just a thin veil to cover his own new-age ideals, and lack of commitment to the REAL christian practices and knowledge."
1,Crooks!!,"They advertise the purchase as a case of 10 (TEN), boxes of towels, each box having 88 towels. ""91% SAVINGS"" off regular price of $117.00. I ordered 4 cases and they shiped 4 boxes. Liars, crooks, worst experience I've had on ebay, Amazon, or any other site."
3,"Nice finish, but tearout is disappointing","I've been using the stock blade on the dewalt mitersaw I bought new a year ago. Now that I'm getting into something besides chopping off pine 2x4s, I wanted to get a nicer blade. I've always been of the mindset, ""buy the nicest stuff available--it will be a pleasure to use and will last much longer than the cheaper alternatives,"" and was led to this blade. Freud's reputation (and all these reviews) left me expecting two things: smoother end-grains, and no more tearout. While I agree with all the posters that you can't beat the finish, I'm still finding a disappointing amount of tearout on pine, cherry, and oak. I can reduce it with a sacrificial throat and backstop (as suggested by another reviewer), but I was EXPECTING to AVOID all that hassle when spending this kind of money. I mean, it is called ""ultimate"" cutoff... Anyway, I have a Forrest blade on order, and hope to find tools that are WORTH their premium price."
3,"Freud 12""-96 tooth LU85","After setting up my new DeWalt sliding miter saw I decided I wanted a better blade for cabinet work, The first blade I bought was the 12-96T Freud Diablo, and after a few cuts I new that this was not the precision I wanted, so after reading the reviews I sent the Diablo back and ordered this blade, The blade runs smooth but the cut edges are torn out on the back side, and when I cut a piece of 5 1/2"" base molding at a 45* the back side is splintered about 1/8"" deep. I just bought a 10"" Forrest WW11 for my table saw and WOW, from now on the Forrest is for me. For those who want to try the Freud good luck (as for me the Forrest chpmaster is my choice)"
3,Make sure you have a really good saw,"I have purchased this recently and i must say it does a good job of cutting smaller stock and the finish is impressive, but you should condider a thin kerf blade if you are going to cut a lot thick stock. I have a bosch 4212 mitre saw and going through thick hardwoods the blade bogs down. The tradeoff with the thin kerf is the extra vibration, but if you are going to cut a lot of thick stock, I would reccomend against this blade."
3,Not Worth The Additional Cost,"Purchased this blade for a DeWalt 12-inch compound miter saw. Although the blade does a good job on most cuts, I honestly see no difference between this blade and my old Freud blade costing a little over half as much. I definitely would not spend the additional money for this blade again."
5,High Class Lens!,"Let me just say, WOW! Previously I had purchased cheap chinese knock off lenses and they didn't do much. I had a +1, +2, and +4. I had bought this lens to stack on the rest. When I got the lens I was blown away at the quality of this lens. It is very heavy and the lens is of very high quality even the case was high quality. Although the lens is not stackable, I think you'll find that it is the only one you will need. I'm very glad I made this purchase."
4,great book,"i thought this book was really good.it's very similar to a lot of other teen books, but the story is still good."
5,Great read.,Terrific book. Get it if you are interested in Buddhism or are just simply interested in the subject. Different ways of seeing the world was very eye opening and refreshing for me. I had to read it for a class but I truly enjoyed this book.
2,the problem is >>,"This is the book for begginers , it gives youbasic rules about creating webpages , it givesyou scripts that you can find in web without any help.It has true words and nice photoes but nothing more, ifyou're searching something about : how to do nice-lookedwebpages , how to organize work by using grid, make good colorcombinations , work with typography to find attractivesolutions, you will not find it here."
5,Lots of helpful layout ideas,"You'll find plenty of examples of good, clean layouts with tips on creating similar pages. The online tutorials are helpful and leave more room for full-color graphics of actual websites. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. Be sure to check out all the recommended sites for tons of examples. A good book for quick reference to well-though-out designs."
5,A great resource.,This book offers a host of useful design suggestions that will help to avoid many of the most common mistakes. If you are a technical person like myself and you frequently wonder why some pages are so much more appealing than others you will find the answers in this great book.
1,Pretty Pictures---Poor Content,"This book is full of wonderful pictures of several great web layouts, and as promised, it doesn't force the reader to learn HTML...or anything else, either.I found it to be pretty much a large scale advertisement for NOT learning to do Layout design, rather than a book ""filled with the latest tips and tricks"". Instead, this book strongly recommends using a multitude of WYSIWYG programs such as Dreamweaver to name one, specifically, rather than teaching the beginning web designer, or any other level web designer how to integrate design layout into an actual HTML created web site.I found this book to be extremely disappointing at any price."
2,Picture and songs shown are wrong!!,"The pictures shown and song list from another reviewer are NOT for the record described. The song list and pictures are for Volume 2 of the same title. You will get volume 1 if you order this. It has an okay mix of songs by various artists, but not the ones shown in the other review. If you're looking for the 90's version of Sinatra's Silent night, with just Frank Jr accompanying on the piano, look for something called THE CHRISTMAS ALBUM GIFT OF HOPE"
2,Not great,My kids [5 and 7] read it maybe twice and haven't picked it up since. I was kind of uncomfortable reading it to them since the Magic Plane seems to be a V-22 Osprey. That's a military plane and I don't know that it's a really good subject for a kids book. Makes you wonder if the woman who wrote it had some kind of stake in the plane.
1,Boring boring boring,"Obviously the first attempt by the author at creating a children's book. The 'story' is repetitive to the point where it becomes dull and interest wanes. Finally, when the 'magic plane' does arrive, it occupies no more than two pages of the book, leaving one to wonder why it's so prominently mentioned in the title if it's not going to play much of a part in the book. The result is a promise of adventures in a magic plane, but a delivery of a long, painfully repetitve conversation between two standard issue characters.The audio tape does not add much, except to give one the visual image of Albert being sorely in need of an education or, at the very least, speech therapy.Pass on this one. You can easily find a dozen books not only more entertaining, but more educational."
2,Complicated,"This video would be a great workout if the combinations weren't so fast and complicated. I've been kickboxing for 2 years, and there is no chance I could follow this. I'm usually pretty stubborn, and have to finish what I start, but I got too frustrated with this video and actually quit half way through. I'm disappointed..."
3,needs work,"This saw out of the box WILL NOT CUT A 2X6 AT 90 DEGREES NOR BEVEL A 2X6 AT 90 DEGREES. With some filing of the right hand fence top I could get the saw to lower itself and cut a 2x6 at 90 degrees by 90 degrees. Beveling at 45 degrees by 90 degrees was impossible. The blade gruard, nut etc. prevents the blade from penetrating all the way through the wood. Otherwise it is a light weight and durable machine. It bewilders me why Makita would make a 10"" saw with a 15 amp motor that can't cut a 2x6."
4,does its job,"Both the miter and bevel scales started peeling off almost immediately, and it is a noisy little screamer, but it cuts accurately and adjusts easily, and is light and compact. Basic no frills workhorse."
2,Makita 10 inch saw,"This saw does not stay square on the 90 positive stop. On the 45 positive stops, ones on 45 the other on 46. There is too much play on the saw when you are making a cut. Also, the guard sticks about 75% of the time, sometimes open and somtimes closed. Finally, I would never buy a Makita miter saw again, and go with a better brand."
1,Makita Saw less than expected,"The Makita LS1040 looks to be a fine little saw, but the one we received did not cut straight, and there were no adjustment instructions. We did not try to adjust it, feeling that a brand new saw should not need adjustments. We sent it back."
2,"Amazon says assembled in the U.S, but saw is Made in China","The saw is fine for what I paid. My real gripe is that part of the reason that I chose this model is that Amazon stated in the specs that the saw was assembled in the U.S. Instead, it has the MADE IN CHINA logo emblazoned everywhere. I try to buy American when I can. Amazon isn't helping here..."
3,Not sliding,I should have purchased a sliding compound mitre saw instead of a non-sliding one. They are so much more useful for cutting plywood sheets etc.
4,A good all around saw,I have run this saw for four years. It is the old standby in my shop. It is fairly rugged for on site work as well and transports easily due to its light weight construction. The trigger safety on my saw is broken however. It is one of those small plastic parts that is easily cracked when throw in the back of a pickup at the end of the day. If I had to change anything about this saw I would have made that little button out of some type of strong alloy. This saw will do everything from medium size framing jobs to cabinetry work and moulding installations. It is a good addition to any shop.
4,nearly there,"for the price this is the saw you need, you may want a 12inch sliding saw but this will do 98% of all tasks that you have. I went looking for a good blade for my old compound slider and ended up walking out of the toolshop with the makita, and i don't regret it. it's small enough to be kept in a tool box instead of rolling around on the back of my pick up. compact unit thats easy to lug around and will handle framing and trim with ease. the jerky nature of the motor is the only consern, and thats why it only gets 4 stars form me."
1,"Nothing Against You Other Reviewers, But In Comparison...","Hey, you guys enjoy this CD. I am not a big fan of the hard-core ""noise"" genre. The sounds of Merzbow, Masonna, and *ahem* Whitehouse don't really do anything for me but make me feel physically uncomfortable while listening to it. This recording falls into that ""uncomfortable"" category.Screams, RELENTLESS edgy, distorted tones...It's enough to make you want to... turn it off. There was one reviewer who ""sleeps"" to this music. That individual must scream and chatter like a rabid squirrel when they sleep. This music drills a hole in your head, and pours peroxide on the wound - festering and bubbling in your brain. Definitely not music to ""sleep to""...I'm glad there are some folks out there who appreciate the harshness and purity of the noise genre. I am not one of you.I'd recommend ANY other Nurse With Wound recording over this one. The ""Whitehouse-influence"" factor makes me run for the hills."
2,Sound better on LP,This live concert sounds a little better on LP than CD. The transfer to CD does not seem optimal nor remastered.
5,Best I've Used!,I have never used an easier tool. Great product and very solid! It's heavy/solid feel only reminds me of great quality. Oh yeah back to my wine!
4,A classic entertainment essential,"When the time comes to get a gift for my husband, I have to be very accurate and creative because He usually tries to get ahead about minor details. That is how I got to this corkscrew, which finally stopped him struggling to open any kind of wine bottles. He is really very pleased for the extraordinary style and well-made design. It won't be a bad idea to get a couple of them for Christmas gifts to our family and friends."
3,Hard to get over the bottle neck,The product does not open enough to easily fit over the top of some wine bottles. It then can tip to one side and put the corkscrew in at an angle.
1,Not durable enough to be a WMF,"It's not very easy to use and the plastic parts broke in my hand after about 2 dozens of bottles; buying a traditional wine opener now ""WMF Clever and More Waiters Knif"""
2,Takes getting used to,"After getting used to this, works great. Should have come with a holder though like my prior ones did. Just be careful of the very sharp point on the corkscrew tip."
5,Love the guitar,"Definitely worth listening to. My 14 year old listened to these girls and loved the album as well. I believe the 2005 ""No Apologies"" album is even better. Just a gauge though...we both also love Green Day."
2,Judging a book by its cover,"The authors have reviewed the website of these companies - not the actually shopping. For most of the sites, they've never made an actual purchase - just walked through the shopping cart. So they write about ease of navigation and cost of shipping, but largely ignore whether they site actually ships promptly and accurately, how they handle defects and mistakes or billing questions.Very disappointing - I can evaluate the sales website for myself. What I need to know - and can't find out without making the purchase - is whether the people at the other end are reliable, helpful and honest. And this book tells me nothing about that."
3,"great book, awfully familiar","thepurplebook is a great book for those who don't get out to read Cosmo, Glamour,InStyle, YM, W, GQ, Better Homes and Garden and basically any periodical currently printed in the U.S. or abroad. The term ""authorship"" is so loose these days. Sure the sites are great, if you can find one that works. We all know how website have a tendency to die online. However, I found some real gems. Thanks InStyle! It's really too difficult to decipher (and the print is too small) for the elderly. And the gen-exers like myself, really don't have the cash to spend $200 for a handbag or pay the large amount of money alot of these sites are asking for their goods and services. I probably wouldn't buy thepurplebook, instead I'd pick it up at your local library."
5,Air Safety- The Truth Finally Comes Out,"The author of the book SAFETY LAST is to be commended for exposing the airline industry for its true state and the gross incompetency of the FAA that, though charged with the safety of the travelling public is little more than a cesspool of corruption, incompetency, conflict of interest. Captain Power Waters points out how the FAA is charged with both safety and promotion of aviation, clearly a conflict of interests that has killed hundreds of people over the years and turned numerous aircraft into piles of scrap metal. I think everyone who is about to board an airplane for someone should read this book and the others that this courageous captain has written. One hell of an eye opener awaits the air traveller."
3,Need the right space,"The jumper works just as it says and I have a 5 month old that likes it. The problem I didn't think about is that when he's in the doorway I have to watch carefully that he doesn't accidentally swing into the doorway or start spinning too fast, which upsets him. I think if you had a large opening it would be fine but I wouldn't plan on using it on just any door opening."
2,Too Dangerous,I bought this for my nephew. Not only was this dangerous but he screamed his head off. I don't recommend it but every baby is different.
2,Buy another product,"I have returned this jumper. It is the first baby toy I have returned.My son is 4.5 months old and loves the Fisher-Price Jumperoo. We wanted a lower-priced and different (for variety) toy for my parents' house. Unlike us, they have doorways appropriate for a doorway jumper, and this one looked so colorful and fun!Complaints:1. My son did not appear comfortable in this toy. He was constantly leaning to one side or another, never balanced.2. It looks like it would be adjustable to almost any height, but really there is velcro only on a small part of the cord, so it doesn't adjust much at all.3. The toys are silly and did not interest him at all.4. It just wasn't very springy. He flies around in the jumperoo and could barely jump at all in this toy.I don't know if the problem is doorway jumpers versus jumperoos, as I have not tried another doorway jumper, so I did not give the single star I think the product deserves. But based on my experience, I would NOT recommend this jumper."
1,returning this jumper,"We bought this after our 5 month old really like jumping in a different jumper at Grandpa's house. This Sassy Jumper was the only type we found which had a clamp that would fit over our crown molding (we have a house built in 1900). That is the only plus I can see about it.the cons: our boy couldn't get upright to jump, the way the straps are that hold the jumper he was always leaning one way or the other. After a couple of minutes he leaned too far to one side and hit his forehead on the door frame! We took him out right away and boxed it back up. I had read the directions and had adjusted it to the best of my ability, so I believe it is a bad design.The other jumper with tray and 3 straps is great, we'd get one of those except for the clamp won't fit. Do not buy this jumper, everything about it says 'cheap', and results in a dangerous item."
1,Don't bother,"This is the first baby toy that I have absolutely hated. Our son hated it, too and we returned it. First of all, it is really hard to bounce. Our son is 7 months old and bounces like a ball all over the house and couldn't bounce on this jumper. Second, getting him in and out of it was a minor feat. He cried every single time, no matter how gentle we tried to be. Finally, the way it hangs, he rocks from side to side and spins around in circles. He loved the spinning to a point, then it got him really upset because he couldn't control it.We returned it and bought a Graco and he loves it."
3,"Fun, but not the best","I started using this jumper with my daughter when she was four months old, and we continued to use it until she could cruise furniture. She really loved the toy, and couldn't get enough of her reflection in the lion :) But she was always leaning to one side and only jumping on one foot; there was no stability. And I really wish the cover was removable to wash it; the box said it was, but there was no way to get the cover off the glued ropes. After a while we borrowed my sister in law's fisher price jumper, and it was incredible (though much more expensive!) and she could stand upright and jump in it with both feet. She continued to like both, but I felt more comfortable with her in the other jumper."
1,Buy another product,"Sassy Seat Doorway JumperPoorly designed jumper. My daughter is 6 months old and did not like this jumper at all. What they don't show on the box is that the ropes attache to a bar that is straight across so if the baby leans to the side, the seat tips and the opposite foot comes off the floor and they are lop-sided. My daughter didn't like the off-balance feeling and would cry. Not a great design for stability. I also noticed that on the front of the box, they photoshopped the rope on the left side oft he baby so that it doesn't show it in front of it's face. The ropes are right in the way and really frustrated my daughter. She couldn't get to the toys so those were kind of useless if using with the jumper. I was just really disapointed, especially for the price. Try the Graco Door way or one of the floor jumpies."
5,Keeps on going!,"I have owned this belt sander for 9 years now and it has never let me down. The dust collection works great, belt changes are a snap with the lever. This is one of those tools that just feels right in your hand, powerful but light. Extra wide base is for flush sanding. Would buy again in a minute."
3,Last Page Printed Upside Down,"Last Page Printed Upside Down otherwise a great, cute book. Love David instead of Dorthy. It is nice that Elmo has a special blanket."
4,Cute book,My toddler is getting ready to go to a big bed and I wanted a book to help me explain this to him. The pictures are vivid and the story line is short and to the point--exactly what I was looking for.
3,Meh,"Didn't help much for our intended purpose, but then again, my son's a stubborn little guy. I do think I paid too much for it though, it really should be available at the dollar store for a dollar like the Sesame Street Beginnings books that both my kids enjoyed, especially since the SSB books were both longer and contained more words."
5,Excellent,This book came to my address in excellent condition and my daughter loves to have it read to her over and over.
4,Nice Book.,"My little ones, one and two keep asking if that is elmo's mom, which they dont illustrate her face. Otherwise they like the book."
3,Short basic book,"Very well drawn, writting is very basic, even for our 21 month old. Has Elmo in it though which is what counts :) Not really value for money."
3,Good supplement to a longer bedtime story.,"A short and sweet board book. Not much of a story, and a lot shorter that my twins or I had anticipated, but it was Elmo, and most kids seem to connect to Elmo. I read my own story to this book, and provided additional explanations to create a full experience about moving to a big bed. I also read another book along with this book, and the kids seemed to connect to that story better, as it was about the whole transition, including no longer cosleeping with parents. This book would be a good supplement for a book that provides a little more of a story. My 2 1/2 year old twins love to listen to me read, and this book wasn't long enough, as they asked for 'more stories'."
3,Cute book,"Cute book, it gets the point across in a short period of time. It takes less than two minutes to read."
5,Great for getting into a big boy bed.,We started reading this book to my 2.5 year old son about a week before we took him out of his crib. When we put him in a full bed we let him take it with him every night to sleep. He also takes it out and grabs a blanket and a pillow and pretends to sleep on the floor. I firmly believe it has helped smooth the transition.
2,short and not helpful if your kid has never slept in a crib,I bought this book to help transition my toddler to her own bed from the family bed. I didn't realize that the book specifically talked about Elmo moving from his crib to his own bed. This wasn't so helpful for my situation.
4,basic but good,"My (just turned) 2 yr old loves this quick, little story. Emphasis on quick! The pictures are great, vibrant colors - my son loves to study each page. A good buy for the $$$, for young toddlers."
4,Elmo getting a new bed,"This is a great book to purchase for your toddler that is making the transition from a crib to a bed. My daughter was climbing out of her crib at 22 months and wouldnt stay in her new bed. However, she loves Elmo and she loved this book! I think it even showed her that beds are cool- especially because Elmo has one. It is not too long or too short of a book."
4,A,I read this book to my son on his first night in a big boy bed. He likes the book and it seemed to help the transition.
2,Not much to it,"I was very disappointed when receiving this book. It is only about 5 pages long! There is very little text as well. The illustrations are ok, but nothing special. It doesn't last long enough to get my 20-month old interested. She will glance through it for about 10 seconds and toss it aside. This is from a kid who LOVES to read."
3,Ehhh...,This book might work on a 1-2 year old but not so great for any child older than 2. My child lost interest after reading it for the first time. J
2,Slow,"Had to be Hugh's worst movie. Watched at least 45 minutes, couldn't finish, too slow...Maybe got better later, not a keeper!"
1,NOT A ROMANTIC MOVIE AT ALL!,they lie to you and tell you its a romantic comedy...but in reality its NOT. its FAR from a romantic comedy.
1,Worst evening of my life.,"I would have rather spent a full 6 hours of an evening watchign a boring 1-0, 15 inning MINOR league baseball game than have to watch this again. If i had a spoon within reach, i would gouge out my eyeballs instead of having to watch this ridiculous, awful film ever again. Worst.....Film.......Ever!"
5,One of Hugh Grant's best,"Easily one of Hugh Grant's best. It's quaint and simple, and the music and scenery will make you want to visit the UK. It's a simple love story, but at it's roots are the people of Wales. This is a movie you can watch over and over again."
5,Fun Family Film,"Most of what I would say to review this film has been said. It you rate films by special effects, shoot em up, kill them all and abuse their women folk, then this is not for you. This film gives you a good, warm feeling throughout. Not that it doesn't touch briefly on the ""seamy"" side as most of the babies in the church look just like Colm Meany's Morgan the Goat, though why Morgan hasn't gone to war is not mentioned. The only drawback is the Irish actors playing Welsh characters and occasionally slipping up in their accents.If you don't speak Welsh you miss a very delightful comment by Williams the Petroleum. When the Englishmen's car is sabotaged they push it to the local garage. Williams breaks a rod and says, ""I see what's wrong with your car but I don't know what you call this in English. In Welsh we call it ""bethyngalw"". There is no more comment on this. Bethyngalw in Welsh simply means ""watchyemaycallit"".Good film to watch with others."
4,Most entertaining DVD,Darling story set in Ireland or Scotland. Very funny and sweet. Huge Grant is very good! Fine supporting cast too.
5,The Englishman Who Went up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain,"Funny stuff - this movie is hilarious! Initially, I only wanted to gawk at Hugh Grant but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I just could not stop laughing at the antics of the townspeople! As with all English flicks - the humor is subtle and constant. Enjoy!"
5,"Action, Gems and Horses make a fascination mystery",The fascination mystery than unfolds when injured Steeplechase Jockey Derek Franklin takes over brother's gem business and suddenly feels like a moving target. The mystery is why he's a target and how to survive while he figures it out.
2,Good recording,Cover and paper work in poor shape but the recording is good . That is what I was looking for.
3,Solid,"Good, solid Dick Francis, I was happy to find a book of his that I hadn't read yet. You have to enjoy the races, a punch-up and a bit of romance and I wasn't disappointed as the mystery was eventually unravelled."
5,FRANCIS never fails,"DICK Francis was such a marvel; two successful, extraordinary careers. He is an author one can always depend on for great characters, solid. riveting plot. Great storyteller."
3,if you ask me...,"it's pretty good, but not really what i was looking for. i wanted more chorus and less soloist but still it's enjoyable."
5,A great ending to a great series!,"Words fail me in trying to express how wonderful I think this series is -- And this series finale episode is probably one of the best episodes of the series ... If you're an Avonlea fan, like so many of us are, this is a must-see! Seeing how Gus is found again and how wonderful everything turns out certainly brings a great ending to a great series ...."
5,A useful global overview of gender history,"I've read quite a few books on women in the West, so it was refreshing to read this short book, which provides a concise and clear introduction to global gender history. Instead of starting with the Greeks, we get to see the Greeks in a broader context, including with premodern Japan, where women had more of a role, especially in culture. One of the things I especially liked about the book was how the author uses direct quotes to give a sense of how individuals either experienced or expressed gender. The second part of the book deals with modernization, with case studies of Russia and Japan, and the impact of the West on the globe from the 19th century. Starting with a global perspective helps to broaden the entire narrative.There aren't any footnotes, but there are useful suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. This is a great place to get oriented to gender history in a global context."
5,Scholarly and informative,"David Instone-Brewer has done a service to the church with this text. Doing some other research on this topic, I was led to this book by Rick Walston's wonderful text, ""Something Happened on the Way to Happily Ever After: A Biblical View of Marriage, Divorce & Remarriage."" Walston and Instone-Brewer come to basically the same conclusions, but Walston indicates early on that his book is written at the popular level for, what he calls, ""the normal everyday Christian."" Yet, in his book, he suggests Instone-Brewer's text for further research. And, I'm glad he did. While Walston's book is good for the average Joe/Jane Christian, Instone-Brewer's book is for the avid student or scholar and a better scholarly text I have not found."
5,Pastor,This is excellent for those interested in academic and pastoral treatment of the issues of divorce and remarriage in our culture and in the church. Best used by those with some facility in biblical Hebrew and Greek though it is not essential.
5,"WOW, Impressive barely fits the bill","Impressive does not begin to contend for the image quality and color that this camera can produce. I know people who have digital slr ranging from nikon d40 and canon xt to the nikon d3 series and canon 1d series and have loved the quality some of these cameras can create. But when it comes to landscape and studio photography (mainly what I do) this can contend with anything from canon or nikon. My dad who just got a canon 40d for 3x the price was amazed as I was at the stunning clarity and quality. The Foveon sensor lives up to what others say about capturing color.There are a couple of things that could use some work though, night shooting and the slow and small buffer. As others have also noted these issues also, but this does not effect my shooting since I do landscape and studio photography and there my experience has been almost unrivaled picture quality and the price is so low (means save money for more expensive lenses), thus I gave it the 5 stars easily."
5,"If you want to get more than pictures, you should get one.","You should get one, if you want to get yourself to a different place. Yes, a place where you cannot rush, you're forced to slow down, to work out, to think. The lower the price of this camera, the more convinced you should be that you will not be able to be always fast and precise, and to deliver always great with it. I think this is the point.That's why my overall satisfaction is a 5 stars, and that's a very high rating considering that sometimes the shutter button gets stuck and that at high ISO the performance is really outrageous (forget about resolution/tone above 400). Sometimes you can get really disappointed, as much as sometimes you feel good with the job you have done. Not just for the pictures, but for the fact that once you get the camera in your hands you know that something is going to change and you must stop while all around everything keeps running."
1,Be careful,"Sigma dslrs enjoy a cult following, and rave reviews from Sigma zealots should be taken with a grain of salt. This is a niche product, quite different in important ways from more mainstream cameras. It is comparatively difficult and inconvenient to use, and the colors it produces are unusual. Those who take the time to cope with the camera's quirks love it. However, if you're new to digital photography or dslrs cameras, I would steer clear."
2,"~ ~ ~ Sigma SD14 Problems, ERROR d7 1E ~ ~ ~",". . .After writing a 6 line email to SIGMA about a problem I was having, A Rory tech wrote back asking many ?'sI had forgot to include the ERROR code (d7 1E). In my Second Email I only wrote, ""ALSO, THE ERROR : d7 1E, is a reacquiring error.The next day I received ""Marcus please send your camera to our service department for further review.""Now waiting to hear from O'donoghue . . .08.17.07,10:29AM/per UPS they received on 08.08.07."
4,Comfy jeans,"I bought SIZE 11/12 Medium. I found the size chart information that Amazon gave out wasn't enough. Therefore I measured the pair I got and typed it here.FIY: Waistline: 17 inches one side (34 inches in total),Inseam: 30.5 inchesI used to wear 10 medium, the size Amazon sold was 9/10 medium, it would be a little small for me I thought. So I went to the store and I tried size 12M and it was also fit me. I thought they were the same brand ""Lee"" it wouldn't be much different in size so I ordered 2 pairs from Amazon (size 11/12M). However, the pairs of jeans that I got from Amazon were a little too big and too long considered they are stretch as well. Hope this help! =)"
3,"ok fit, but too much fabric in belly","these jeans accentuate my ""pooch"" because they pouch out with extra fabric around the zipper instead of laying flat like low-ish-rise jeans ought to. they looked sort of matronly."
5,GREAT PAIR OF JEANS !!!,"I purchased 2 pair of these and figured even if I didn't LOVE them they were a great price. I have never paid less than 30 bucks for jeans, with the deal at Amazon, I got two for the price of one. I love the fit and they are long enough to wear with heels if I want to."
5,The Best!,"As for the mechanics of the book every thing displayed fine and the TOC links worked.Now the story was the best story I have read. I read a lot but maybe reading the wrong things although I read classics. This book is where I truly learned the word epic. Tolstoy did a great job of capturing human emotion and the non verbal language that passes between people that is only recognized by those that are observant.I could go on about the politics, philosophy of life and death, why we are here, and the Russian life of peasant and nobility,...... that was all in this book but one word says it all ""epic"".I saw the movie and thought it was very good but would have been impossible to follow or understand without reading it first. For me, Anna`s story was a lesser reason to read this story, an enjoyable part but not as rich as all the other treasures found in the other characters."
1,This version is full of typos and unreadable,A great book but this version looks like it was scanned from a hard copy and not proofed. Buy a different version.
5,A novel that is definitely worth thinking about,"This classic novel is definitely Tolstoy's masterpiece. Once, you read ""Anna Karenina"" ,you will begin to figure out that Tolstoy is one of the greatest men the world has ever seen.The story of the ruin of a young and charming woman called Anna, will definitely set you thinking about the meaning of holy matrimony. Unhappy with her marriage, Anna seeks a way out of her loveless life. She finds the love she yearned for with Count Vronsky. However, that illegal love takes away her son, her status in society ,and in the end , her life."
5,Sometimes it's great to be a putz ...,"I'm probably one of the very few people who read this classic without having a clue as to the ending (no, never saw the movie--still haven't) ... so it was a genuine surprise and it rocked me. The opening line is a killer ... nothing else like it in all of literature. Although I prefer Dostoevsky to Tolstoy, this is a genuine masterpiece."
1,BOOOOOORINNNNNGGGGGG,"This book, written by the king of bore himself, and 811 pages long has got to be the most pointless book I have ever had to read. It's just about some woman's extra-marital affair with some guy and these two newlyweds' life together. Honestly I could care less. It has no excitement, not much of a thick plot, and is stifling in the reading experience. Which, by the way, was an experience in torture, endurance, and stamina. I wouldn't reccomend this book to any person who has things to do and people to see, it just didn't hold my attention and I didn't care about any of the characters because they were plausable and real."
3,great translation but disappointing binding and print,"I ordered this edition because I am fond of the Maude translation which has been a friend for years. However, I was disappointed in the binding and print which are not of high quality and will not last the course. I bought the book for my son, so that he could (someday) share my enthusiasm for the book. While the text lends itself to this, the binding and print are inferior which detracts from the enjoyment."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"The greatest book ever written? Seriously? Like most Oscar winning movies, this book is an overly acclaimed snooze-fest. A small percentage of it is well written and at times engrossing (for instance; the disastrous horse racing scene and the confrontation chapter between Anna and her husband immediately following). However, that alone couldn't justify the insipid tedium of the vast majority of Tolstoy's behemoth of boredom (Levin's endless fascination and involvement with nineteenth century Russian agriculture and long stale politics, I'm looking at you). If you've got a killer case of insomnia that needs solving, search no further. Otherwise, what a colossal waste of time! For a truly epic literary experience that will keep you up teary eyed and turning pages long into the night, skip this boring, overrated book and read Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman."
4,just a classic,"it's Anna Karenina, this is a superb, 5 stars book... I'm giving it 4 stars because of the edition that has some flaws in the punctuations and the characters' names are halfway translated, but still is a good version, won't get you deviated from the book itself."
3,Anna Karenina,"I like to read books before I see the movie. This was disappointing. It was too drawn out, although the story was okay. I can see why a movie was made, knowing that they could eliminate all the politics and long lengthy chapters. He describles things over and over again."
1,cassette NOT cd's,"this is the music I am looking for , but I asked for cassettes . Why waste my time listing CD's under cassettes?"
3,Watchout,"Watchout: this album is available at CDBaby for only $ 15,00, so asking anything more than that comes close to a rip-off. (But than again a CD is worth what a fool want to pay for it)The last time I learned from this singer was in the late 70's, when she tried to break into country with two albums SEXY SONGS and THE CHASE IS ON, this 2004 releasemoves her closer to the Bonnie Raitt kind of Blues/Country, which needs some getting used to."
3,Few prime freakouts,Functioning psychedelic-prog exudes bluesy integrity but can sound datedly drowned in guitar and organ reverb when not focused on epic instrumental buildup (as the worth-alone-for final track accomplishes).
1,"Okay, but she does not go through the steps before her routine","It's okay but I noticed with all the firm dvds, they do not go through the routine before the actual workout."
2,Disappointed,The picture of the drapes show a valance. I ordered two drapes and they did not come with a valance. I was unaware that they were sold separately. I have bought drapes in the past and they always come with a valance. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
3,Quality issue,The strap has frayed and will have to be repaired after just a few months use. If i had bought it at a store i would be returning it for a new one.
4,Nice basic bag. Excellent value.,I've owned the bag (black) for about a year and it has served its purpose. Plenty of room for work stuff. I even use it as a suitcase for one-night trips. My only criticisms would be: (1) its relative lack of compartments or pockets for smaller items; and (2) the bag picks up every stray piece of lint or animal hair that comes within 10 feet of it!
5,"Great Bag, Awesome Price",This bag rocks. Just the right size for most trips to work or a day of being a tourist. Highly recommended.
2,Don't be fooled,"This is an ok bag but the ""Heavyweight Canvas"" is a very loose weave,that is to say it wont hold back anything stronger than a light fog and wont suffer much abuse. The lining is 3rd rate thinner than paper nylon. In short a good bag if you are buying for fashion, a poor choice if you are actually going to use it. Look out for inflated shipping costs."
1,The best thing in the genre. One star.,"First off, let me say that I detest pop-punk. I was driving with my friend earlier today and she put on this album. I didn't know who it was at first and when the first track came on I was amazed. I mean, all she ever listens to is crappy pop-punk, right? This was friggin' awesome! The choir, the organ, everything was perfect! Then, it ended, and in came the second track. How could a band who can make such an awesome creepy ambient song waste their talent on crappy 3-minute pop-punk songs with 3-5 chords repeated endlessly? If they made an album of songs like that first track, I'd buy it.SUMMARY: Damn good first track. Everything else is horrid."
1,Good Charlotte is so METAL!They wear black!,"Mothers take hold of your middle school daughters, Good charlotte is back on the streets! When i heard that their new record was recorded by Funkmaster Flexx and Silkk Tha' Shocker, I had to goto the nearest hot topic and pick up a copy!! Good Charlotte's follow up to ""Young and the Hopeless"" is a groundbreaking effort -- towards homosexuality that is! Filled with tracks such as ""In this world(murder)"" and ""World is black"" it fuels the rebellions of many 14 yr old boys against their parents! Pretty soon the stock prices in Clairol black hair dye will go through the roof!"
1,rock music sucks,rock music or any type of rock music sucks. im only saying this because im sick of those stupid white trashes who write reviews on rap albums and are saying rap sucks. this goes to all of you white trash redneck prejudice stupid motherfu*kers. the only rock that should exist is Rage Against The Machine and Cypress Hill.
1,"pop-punk is supposed to be memorable, this isn't","i dont understand how or why the chronicles of life and death became a hit, but i do know that pop and punk revival is supposed to be upbeat, catchy, melodic and most importantly, memorable. gc is none of those things now, and although they were before, i don't see a turnaround anytime too soon. Well, thats it, every diss or insult i could possibly put forward has been said to death, so the only thing i can say is go pick up simple plan's still not getting any or lucky boys confusion's commitment instead."
5,death version,this is probably my favorite version of the chronicles of life and death! i love the bonus song meet my maker. all in all it's an amazing cd and should really be listened to. i love it and also saw them in concert and they played the songs of this album and it was great! i love good charlotte and that was the best show ever. any who it's a good cd.
1,Still horrible.,"Welll first thier young and hopeless, and suck, and now there telling aboutlife and death and they still suck!!!! These guys seriously need to go jump in a ditch, and end thier music career. But for those of you gothic, life hating, scum will probably give this horribly bad CD 5 stars. I don't see how. I could play better, and more meaningful music, with pots and pans. This CD's horrible, If you want the ONLY good punk rock (which there is'nt much) get Green Day, or Blink 182, and leave these stupid gothic poser's music behind! If you like this try Simple Plan, or Bowling for sour, 2 very very horrible bands just like this, I hope i made my point, and saved you 15 bucks!!"
1,disapointed,im 14 and when i bought this cd i was diapointed their first cd was prety good and their second cd was good to but this cd sucks its all over computerized garbage! the only reason this even comes close to deserving the one star it got was because the lyrics behind a few songs were good but the music is fake. this cd is junk so dont waste you money!!
1,i really hate it,"I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore. They try to look all punk, but they are pop. They whine a lot. I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool. they should at least stop doing songs about it. They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same. Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny."
5,Change is good.,"I really liked the change that Good Charlotte has shown through this album. It's not full of boastful songs and immaturity, instead it's full of maturity and showing an actual reality. I didn't really like Good Charlotte at first but this CD is pretty good. They're not ""goth"" as someone suggested, that statement is out of proportion, but they are darker."
2,Umm... yeah,"I found this CD in a computer at my school. When I found it I thought ""Hey cool, a free CD!!! Good Charlotte? I've heard they were pretty good."" When I got home I threw it in my CD player and hit play. The intro was different, but I kinda liked it... then the first song kicked in with the line ""you come in this world, covered in blood, they're all soo happy you've arrived."" bouncing along in a pop-ish beat. I was surprised... in a bad way. I listened to the whole song... it was mildly catchy but definitely not my style. I sat patiently through the whole album. And when it finally ended an hour or so later (I have to say I was impressed with the length) I was left very unimpressed. Good Charlotte is a very pop-punk band, and while I like punk, pop is not my thing. So, while I see how some people can like Good Charlotte, I wish I had left this CD in the computer where I found it."
4,A somewhat transitional record,"I am really impressed with this record, I must admit I thought GC did not have much potential for expansion and tight riffs and smooth, slightly nasally vocals were as good as it was gonna get. Joel can really sing, he, for the first time in his career really distinguished himself as a vocalist with the ability to draw a listener in and not merely ride on the melody but possessing the ability to stand on his own and keep hold of your ear. The punk influences are very dampened and just 'rock' would be a more apt title, but they sound good and this album gives them so many places to go next time.As far as the specific songs go, I loathe the chorus of 'the Truth' but the verses sound fantastic, other than that no specific complaints, everything is good, i just wanna live, secrets, and we believe are definitely stand outs for me. And, don't worry, most imporantly, the record still possesses the lovely dance-ability that drew us all to GC in the first place...."
5,An evolving group...,"Don't listen to the whiners about GC. Ofcourse their style will change-DUH! This cd, while slightly morbid, is great. The songs are memorable and have true meaning. Its not the crap that you hear on the radio.Songs like ""Ghost of You"", ""I Just Wanna Live"", ""The World is Black"", and ""Meet My Maker"" are amazing insights into a complicated story of Good Charlotte.This cd is worth EVERY cent!"
1,Well it got worse!,"I wonder if anyone that is reading this can remeber when GC had more fans than 12 year old little girls . Well can you? I thought it couldn't get any worse than the last album. Well it just did. So, the chronicles of life and death.....verdict...they died a long time ago!"
1,Difference,"Ok I just have a question. What is the difference between The Chronicles of Life and Death CD'S, Are they the same with just different titles. Hope you get what im asking!"
2,"Meh, Worth a listen or two","Good Charlotte pulls it off again, 16 tracks of worthless power pop. But you have to give them some credit for trying, this album looks like The Ramones debut compared to their previous album, The Young and the Hopeless. Tracks 1 and 5 are by far the best songs on the disc and the only ones that hold even the slightest hint of creativity. Well, 16 stands apart too, but the singers nasally voice has the power of making that song possibly the worst on the album.For some music that's NOT manufactured and worth your time and money check out Black Flag, The Ramones, Modest Mouse and The Dead Kennedys. If you want somthing a little closer to Good Charlotte (but still great) go with Bad Religion, Green Day, or even Blink-182 (but avoid Take off you Pants and Jacket at all costs)"
1,Wheres Fun Good Charlotte,"I miss the fun good charlotte, Why has GC stopped writing songs like waldorf and little things, and walk by and boys and girls and the anthem and I heard you. Its real depressing that GC thinks you have to write depressing sad boring boring boring songs to mature as a band. I wanna smile when I hear GC. I dont wanna feel descently depressed. If you can write a sad deep Cd then we'll talk. Screw new Boring Good Charlotte. And why are all the GC fans girls now. Its real hard to be a guy GC fan. Listen to the 1st and 2nd GC cds they still rock. This one sucks!!!!!!!!"
5,Come on.,"It is really sad when people go on artist product sites and write trash about them when they dont even listen to the product, besdies what you hear on the radio.I mean come on. Give it up.You obviously cant escape them, so you might as well deal with it.SO if you dont like them, dont talk about them. The people here that do talk about them and only talk about hate for them.So STFU. Ignore it, go listen to your ""GOOD music"" and let the fans listen to GC. They are obviously sucessful in what they do and will continue. SO just bit your tongue and go on with your life.I mean if you hate them so much, why the shiz do you write long things about it. Real people would just go on with their normal lives and not care. Cause thats what cool people do.I like Good Charlotte. Im 16. What?Who the freak cares. I dont bother with your music.Dont bother with mine.(I am referring to all the gc haters who feel the need to waste space on something they hate) not anyone in particular. Just them =)"
1,How the f... they call themselves good Charlotte when it's just bad?,"No need to say more, these f@gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts."
3,"Mmmmm, too melow","The record is good but don't reach the greatness of the lastone. It is still too auto-pleasing, very personal."
1,EMO PLAGUE!!!!,"Good charlotte is one of those embarassing EMO bands that contribute to destroy the brains of the youth in the early 2000's... I respect a human being who listen to emo, but i HATE what this ridiculous emo crap represent!!!The emo crap took the punk image with a total fake attitude and made a lot of people thought that it's rock n'roll...But, is not! It's the same kind of the backstreet boys with guitars...IT's RIDICULOUS, SAD, PATHETIC!!!! Stay away from the EMO plague, it can turn you into a sissy stupid kid!!!BEWARE!!!"
2,.... Whatever,"Okay, its your basic B-movie with some nudity, a story line that makes a tiny bit of sense to keep you in it but it's like okay... to a point"
2,LAP DANCER,"stupid. only 2 girls go topless. makes women everywhere look exceptionly bad. what m,ore can i say about this movie"
1,Terrible customer service,I actually have not opened the product as I was hoping to return it. The selling store does not allow returns unless the product is damaged.
4,IT WORKS!,"this is a good product..no static at all but there is a volumn drop and i have to crank my 2006 accord radio to the max..and it still is not very loud...i listen to pod casts ..so i dont need music volumn...if i do i just put in the earphones.I would prefer to hardwire the ipod in..but outside of that, you cannot beat this for 29 bucks."
2,Don't waste your money,"With a price tag of $100 I would think that this thing would do everything and do it well. However I was disappointed when I plugged it into my power port on my vehicle. First of all if you have a ""Power Port"" like some vehicle makes it probably will not fit in it well enough causing the device to power off when you hit a bump. It must be in a cigarette lighter. Second, I was very disappointed with the quailty of the sound. I knew that by using an FM transmitter I would be sacrificing quality, but it was a lot worse than I expected.Some good things about this product are that it uses the full FM spectrum from 88.1-107.9. That's nice when you need to find a unoccupied frequency in the upper ranges. It's also nice that this device charges your iPod while you travel.Overall, I would say save your money unless you don't mind poor quality and I would say only use it then if you don't have a tape deck."
2,Disappointing at best,"Great idea, not so great execution. If you've read the other reviews here you should already have a pretty good idea what's wrong with this product. But I need to add one more serious flaw: it's not stereo. Sure, it lights the little ""stereo"" light in your car's FM radio- but it sounds like all left channel / right channel separation is lost in the audio- even with a good, strong, clear signal on an unused FM frequency. Now of course I can't be certain whether this is a design omission, or if my unit is simply defective. To me , it doesn't matter; it's unacceptable in either case."
2,Won't last you..,"First off let me say that when this product works it sounds fine, i had no trouble with that at all. But more importantly i've gone through 3 of these in a month and all with the same problem. Something goes wrong between the cigarette adapter and the actual cradle itself. First signs are that if you leave your cradle in the wrong position no power at all, followed later by having to have your cradle in just the right position to get it to work (even the most minor touch such as touching it to pick it up resulted in loss of power), and finally no matter what position you put it in no power at all."
2,Maybe mine was bad but ....,"The mechanical swivel arms broke and now it's in a bigger mess. Cannot use the product at all. Waste of my money :( If I could re-rate this product, I'll give it the lowest!Original Review - 2 Stars!The charger works as expected but the problem I ran into pretty soon is that the whole thing adds a lot of weight when the ipod is in the charger and the charging rod (or whatever its called) starts to rotate until it goes around and my ipod falls off the unit. This is pretty critical - otherwise I am having to continuously worry about my ipod being in place and lose focus on my driving"
3,DLO TransPod,"Price was great, half of normal retail, but it did not work with the mini IPOD. Had to return."
3,dlo transpod,wires can be detached if turned the wrong way- it happened to me but was able to take apart and re solider
3,maybe the 3rd time's a charm,"My wife got me the 8gb nano for Christmas along with the transpod. The transpod quality was horrible on any station I put it on. I tried every single one, but it acts like something is wrong with it. I tried my wifes iRiver adapter and it sounds great, but doesn't charge. So,I returned it, but the nano will not fit in the second one I got. The adapter seems to be off just enough for the nano not to line up. I really want this thing to be the solution I'm looking fir, so I will try one more."
3,Converter Vs CD's?,"This Ipod converter is really handy to have for your car rather than searching for different CDs constantly, but the sound quality could be better. If you like your music loud I dont recommend this item. Other than that its worth the $$$$."
1,I can't believe I spent $100 on this.,"I love my iPod so much that I was willing to shell out a C-note to give me the ultimate accessory for the car. What a mistake. Transpod's FM transmitter is bassy and has lots of hiss, no matter what frequency you choose. The holder arm has joints that slip and get disconnected, causing it to lose power and making the whole thing quit working. Transpod is a great idea, but severely flawed in execution. It's also overpriced... but again, had it worked properly, I would have gladly paid even more. My recommendation: get a $7.99 cassette tape adaptor and plug it straight into your iPod. It sounds and works far better."
2,"Great idea, poorly executed. High freq whine is a problem.","This product is a great idea and they really thought of everything in terms of features. But the execution is very poor. The system does not lock in the iPod very well and you get intermittent high frequency whine, probably due to a ground loop. When you touch the case of the iPod the high freqeuncy whine goes away. The bandwidth does not go down past 88.1, which is a problem in a big city where most of the channels are occupied with powerful stations. Most car radios can tune down to 87.5 or so. The white color is very noticable and it practically blares out that ""There is an Apple iPod in this car. Please break in!!!"". It's nice that it color coordinates with the iPod, but a ore discrete color scheme would be more practical. The construction feels shoddy. They could do a better job. Again, it's a great concept but it's porrly executed and I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Thought I'd give it a shot...,"Got this for my nano and it will work for occasional use but sound quality is not good enough for me. It's quite big and bulky but hooked up and worked as advertised. No problem finding a quiet frequency here in the Seattle area. If you've got a decent stereo in your car/boat, you will likely not be satisfied with the sound quality. If you just want to play background music or audio books, it works great."
5,the Best car solution so far,"i have purchased BelKin, Monster and DLO and realize that DLO has the best connection and more choices on selecting the FM freq than the other two. I would strongly recommened this one in case you want to have ipod on your car."
4,Great product for price,"FM quality outstanding, mount sturdy I like the extra extensions. Great product only gripe has to do with clunkyness. Something slimmer would have worked great!.Would not have paid 99 for it but definetely worth it for the 49 bucks. Plenty of stations to choose from, works great where other transmitters have failed!!! why pay more for iMonster this one does it all. No I don't work for these folks, just a happy consumer, finally a product that delivers...."
4,It works well.,"One star taken away because it doesn't really fit my iPod Nano. It can be rectify by cutting the pad provided (originally for the new iPods, I think) and filling the holder with it. A job that can be done in 5 minutes, but still a job.Otherwise the product works well. The transmitted signal is steady, with a little static on some rare occasion.True, the sound quality is worse than an actual FM station, but that's what you expect from an in-car transmitter. When you are driving, with all other noises, it hardly matters. If sound quality is so important for you, you probably shouldn't listen to musics in your car at the first place."
4,College student on the go...,"I just started commuting back and forth, to and from home and University of Texas. (Hook'em!) *ahem* I thought an fm transmitter would be great for those long rides in the car. The DLO was cheap for a broke college student and it works very well! I have no static problems whatsoever and it serves its purpose. The only thing I had a problem with was it's bullkiness. The other minor things I wish it would have are a remote and direct volume change from the transpod. Other than that, it's good for what you pay for!"
4,Good,"I liked it. I didnt have to change too many frequencies. I owned a different branded FM transmitter before(Griffin iTrip Mini FM Transmitter for iPod Mini), this is way better than that. But the design could be improved. I felt like to many joints while connecting. I live in DC metro where it is hard to find any unused frequencies but this performs on 87.9 itself. anyways it is good start for FM tranmitter. I would recommend to everyone."
2,Not the best option,"i recently bought the DLO Transpod a few days ago. The sound quality was very poor. Being a classical and jazz enthusiast, i was very disappoined to find the play quality nearly horrendous on these types of music. The bass was horrible and static was most prevalent. The extensions used to connect the Tranpod to my car were a bit bulky and designers used cheap parts. Wherever the manufacture came up with the $100 price tag is a mystery to me, but i cant complain too much for i got suckered into buying the device myself. The concept of the DLO transpod, however, is innovative-as having a docking staion which acts as a ipod charger and transmitter. The concept was executed horribly. My suggestion is to buy a cassette adapter or a car kit which includes one (as i have done) for better sound quality. I personally suggest one of the Belkin auto kits which are nearly 60% less than the Transpodmike"
3,Sacrificing Sound Quality for Convenience,"The nice thing about it is it is very convenient. It gets rid of all clutter. People have said it is built like crap, i don't understand that, its put together well. It has a very powerful transmitter, I NEVER hear static. Plus you can tune to any unused station in the whole spectrum. But the sound quality is simply HORRIBLE. I know that sound quality from an FM transmitter is worse than a cassete adapter. But this one is the worst sounding unit Ive ever had. Ive had 5 different models. I recomend the Belkin Tunecast II. You can also tune to any available frequency but you need keep it pretty close to your stereo because the signal is pretty weak. In terms of sound reproduction, it blows the Transpod out of the water."
4,"Design just OK, but works well.","I am quite pleased with this purchase. It took some fiddling with the plug extension to get it to not hit the shifter. It would be a lot better of you could angle the extension horizontally around the shifter rather than just vertically to go above or below it. Once adjusted it does hold the iPod quite securely and convieniently. Sounds great. More expensive than other options, but for me it was worth it to get good sound and I like having the holder.Pros:Excellent sound quality.Wide station selection (backlit) and easy to change.Holds iPod (unlike cable-only models), secure, regular or mini.Charges while it plays.Cons:Can't adjust horizontally to position towards driver or passenger.Expensive."
5,This is what I was looking for!,"I had the iTrip and it sucked. It had tons of static, bad quality, always going in and out of signal etc etc. I tried all the stations recommended for this area, all were terrible. I then got this as a gift, and it RULES. I plugged it into my car lighter, it charges the IPOD, automatically selected a channel to use, and started cranking out my tunes perfectly! This thing works like a charm. I havent heard even so much as a bit of static yet- over a week in. It seems that different products get varied reviews depeding on where they are used. I can say for sure that this little baby works GREAT in San Diego!!!"
2,Not a good fit!!!,"I got this as a gift. Unfortunately I could not use it. As it seems, the way the thing is designed, and the way my truck is designed I couldn't find a way to make it fit. Where my outlet plug in my truck is right behind my gear shifter. So there was no way the i Pod was going to fit in the holder with out getting hit by the gear shifter. If you tried to use the arm extension they give you the thing bounces around or spins around because the i Pod is too heavy. I have the larger I Pod. It's the video one. So, I would check to see where your outlet is before buying. I ended up getting the Griffin 9501-TRIPCBL iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger. Very happy with it. Sounds great and was easy to use. Good luck and Happy trails...."
2,the whole is less than the sum of its parts,"I tried this out for a couple of days, then I got rid of it. Yes, it's an Ipod holder, car charger, and FM transmitter all in one, but the problem with any accessory that does more than one job is it never does any one particular job as well as something that does only that job. First, I had a very difficult time getting the Ipod in and out of the holder; second, underneath the sound, there was always an annoying BUZZ; third, it doesn't automatically turn the I-pod off when you turn the ignition off, something my simple Belkin car charger will do. My advice: don't try for the all-in-one solution."
2,Dont like it,This FM transmitter is just bad. I should have just gone to a car audio stor and let them set me up with an installed item that really woked and was not an FM transmitter. From what I have learned some more rural parts of the country may have better luck with this item but in LA there are few spots on the radio dial that are not taken and every couple of miles I am searching for a new station for my ipod. Dont buy it if you plan to use it in a large metropolitan area.
4,Not bad but missing a power button,I got this in last week and tried it out. It works just as advertised and is a good value for the price but it needs a on/off switch to stop the current drain if you leave plugged in as I want to do. Other than that it is a bargain.
4,Value for Money,"Pros- Very good signalCons- Audio quality is same as FM Radio [I can't complain much, after all this is FM transmitter]- need to remove the IPOD case to fit in."
2,Not worth the money...,"At best, it works.This not a QUALITY sound solution. If you can plug into auxilary jacks on your car radio, that's the better way to go. There is a hiss or high pitched hum that comes through. It seems to be from the iPod hardrive spinning, but I am not sure.The adjustable ""arm"" that plugs directly into the car lighter is not a very stationary setup (wobbly). If you try to snug the thumb screw joints to stop it from moving, you can crack the plastic joint. I did just that. I am still trying to fix it. What appeared to be an easy fix with crazy glue is turning into a major repair. The whole joint came apart. I may have to use some of the optional pieces included.Of course, DLO does not appear to have a website."
4,Transpod is the BEST,"After trying the iTrip that isn't worth a nickel much less $40, I returned it and got the Transpod. I was hoping not to spend this much, but a friend of mine has one and hers works great. The Transpod plays clear and charges at the same time. The iTrip crackles and is a pain, plus all the stations you have to program into your iPod. Don't bother, if you can afford the extra $60 get the Transpod, plus you can get them in black now, so it's not as obvious that you have it in your car. GET ONE."
4,Very nice product...stylish and functional,"Ok so an FM transmitter isn't going to have the same crystal clear sound you might get with a direct dock approach (i.e. no wireless transmission)... but for what it is intended to do, this product delivers and lets you enjoy all of your iPod music if, like me, you don't have a fancy new car radio with special iPod input jacks. Bought this for $29 on what must have been a close-out special on Amazon, so it was definitely worth the money. The iPod is going to wiggle a little, and also you can't get the iPod in the docking station without removing whatever skin or protector you use. But it charges the iPod while playing, and unless you're driving offroad, I doubt the wiggling is going to be a big issue. If it bothers you, just find something to wedge beside the iPod so it doesn't jiggle as much."
2,Transpod does not last..Very disappointing,"The first six months I had my transpod it worked fine. The audio quality is not fantastic, however, with some adjusting of the bass & treble it was fine. However, one morning I plugged in my Ipod & got a lot of static feedback over the channel I normally use which turned into a loud high pitch squeal. I tried tuning into several other ""blank"" stations, the high pitch squeal persisted on all of them. When I unplugged the transpod the squealing stopped. I had the product too long to return and am very disappointed that a $100 product lasts barely six months."
3,Does the trick...,"The DLO TransPod worked for me... for a while. The audio seemed pretty good, never really had a problem getting a clear signal, however, the unit is just bulky. Often when I turned a corner, it would fall over. I drive a Volkswagen and it is not very compatible - the connector arm was not small enough and did not extend far enough for my iPod to be situated out of the way of the drink holder or the gear shift. Might work better with other vehicle makes, if your cigarette adapter is in a convenient place... Overall, it does the trick, but I imagine there must be a better and more convenient solution out there."
4,Much better than Griffin Technologies iTrip,The first FM transmitter I used was Griffin Technologies first version of the iTrip. The DLO TransPod product is 100% better. Granted the new itrips now have LCD displays and are easier to turn the frequency channel but they still don't have the built in dock and charger. The reason I had to buy this product was because I was using my itrip and had my iPod sitting on my passenger seat I went around a corner and the iPod fell on floor and my iTrip broke. Which turned out to be a blessing! This products built in dock and charger alone are worth the extra money. I've been thoroughly pleased with this purchase. If you are considering this product and the iTrip choose the DLO TransPod.
1,Felt like i was ripped off just like a real carnival!,"Really did not like this game. Maybe okay for 5 and under, but the games have preset number of turns and are just a waste of time. Get the Wii Party Games, cheaper and more fun!!!!!!!!!! Some of the games are difficult to figure out how to play. Prizes are as trashy as the real thing. Really felt like I was at the carnival getting ripped off on rigged games... SO in hind site, if you are trying to practice to actually win rigged games at the carnivals...this will give you some practice :)"
5,Highly Recommended,"My family enjoys the diverse number of games and the concept of winning virtual prizes like at a real fair. This game has something for everyone, from skeetball, darts, ring toss, horse racing, shooting water in clown's face - all the games you can think of playing at a fair. The competition games are a big hit in my family. The games are not too long and fun for any age! We've had a lot of laughs playing this game."
4,Wii Carnival Games,"Carnival GamesLooking for a Wii game suitable for the 6+ year old? The Carnival game will entertain children as well as adults. It is fun and requires minimal instruction to play all the mini games. Unlike other games rated ""Everyone"" it's content do not contain violence and offensive language. A perfect substitute while waiting for the local carnival to come to town!"
3,Great game but gets a little boring after awhile!,This game is a great deal if you only pay about 30 bucks or less but any more than that is too much. There is just no point to playing the games as you just don't unlock new games or any worthwhile prizes. You either unlock little virtual stuffed animals or a different version of games YOU ALREADY HAVE UNLOCKED. Great game for about 3 days then it gets boring.
3,its an OK game..,Its just kind of slow paced.. its good for beginners who have never played a wii before..
4,Carnival Games,Definitely a fun game for parties with the Wii. You have to create your own characters and there aren't that many options.... Would be preferable if you could use your mii's...overall fun game though.
3,Not as good as I hoped,"We bought this with our 4 year old in mind. He plays Wii games and we thought this would be a great game for him. I found it a bit tricky, boring and not worth the time. Som games were good, but for the most part, it was a bad game. I would much rather play Super Mario Party 8 or Playground. I would rent this game befor you buy it, that way you can make sure it is a good game for your family."
1,Lame Game !,"I bought this for the family after reading the reviews here. I found it extremely boring watching the kids, and the kids played it once and went back to their other games. It nows sits on the shelf, used once and the kids aren't interested in it at all.IMO, this is a total waste of time, Wii Sports or any of the other Wii games we have belt this lame attempt at entertainment. Don't waste your money, buy something else, if I could rate it lower than 1 star I would."
4,If you are looking for ski ball on wii,So my wife's cousin lovers ski ball and enjoys playing wii. She was very happy with this game. I'm not the biggest fan but the ski ball is well done and I enjoy that part of the game.
1,Worst Game EVER!,I don't even want to give this game any stars at all. This is the WORST GAME EVER! You can't win at any of the games and all it did was frustrate the hell out of me and my two kids! I'm sorry that I even rented it. I wish I could get my $4 back. Don't even bother with this game. It is a waste of time and a waste of money!
2,Not all that much fun,"You can't play a course, just one hole at a time. After 20 minutes, it got old. My kid loved the dressup of the golfer, though. For 15 bucks, ok; for 40, no way."
4,carni fun,"first of i like these games because they are fun in party groupsits not as good as resort, but as good as motion and sports. tried a few levels and just getting the hang of itworth it for the price $3 cheaper than in stores and shipping was free"
3,"Fun at first, then repetitive to adults","I eagerly waited to play this game, but then I was disappointed. It didn't explain how many tickets you needed to have to unlock the other games, so I spent most of my time playing the same 5 games over and over again. Like the real thing, after awhile the novelty wears off. Maybe its a good game for kids, but for adults it wou;dn't be worth the money to buy."
3,Looks better than it is...,"This was an okay game. Not bad enough to get a 1 star, but not great either. It could just be me and it didn't hold my attentioin very long. I think it would be better as a party game. (of course i thought that about Mario party 8 and that was kind of a let down as well)That said they do base tons of the games on actual carnival games which is impressive. You can whack a mole, get your fortune or my favorite! The coin game. Where you put your coins in to try and get more coins out? You can test your strength, shoot some hoops and travel all over the carnival park. There are a lot of games to play and cover but i just think you need the right personality to play them alone. Or maybe just some friends or family that will play with you (my girlfriend doesn't like video games so a lot of the ""family"" games i play by myself).Overall this game was okay. I'd play it again in a group but have no plans on buying it anytime soon. Worth renting and testing out to see if it's for you."
1,Not happy with the characters,"We were so excited about getting this game to play with our two young children. We love carnivals and fairs and were thrilled when we finally received the game in the mail. But our excitement quickly ended when we were picking our characters and realized that there was no option for people of color. We are a mixed race family and have two members with brown skin. There is NO option other than white for the characters, which is incredibly distressing for us and I'm sure others who are not white. We did see a person of color in the game - he was a carnival worker. I think this sets a bad stereotype for children to see. The company should be ashamed of itself."
4,I liked it,"It is fun, they traded it in before I completed half of the game, but my kid is allowed to make that choice (girl 7). Some games are easy, some hard so it makes the purchase worth it."
3,Fun Game for Large Groups or Kids,"We are a two-adult, no children household with a Wii, just to give you an idea of who is reviewing. When we first got this game, we would play against each other and it was fun for the first few days, but gets old pretty quick. I was dissapointed in the purchase until we played with a large group and with our niece and nephew. The game is a lot of fun in groups or with children, but for two adults, it's kind of boring."
4,Good For Younger Age Group,"I see that this game has a lot of reviews, but they seem to be all over the board, so I thought I'd put my two cents in! This game is not a great game for older people, even in a group setting...however if you have smaller children, it's great! My three and half year old can play some of the games and beat me. My seven year old can play all of the games and beat me at some....I'm obviously not a game guru, but have had several platforms and childrens games and this is one of the best for the smaller ones.As other posters have mentioned, it may be worth it to rent before purchasing."
4,Very fun...,I purchased this for a gift for my niece and she loves it. She said its easy to play yet challenging enough to keep her intrest. Great Game
5,fun,"We like this game. The kids play this for hours, very fun. Just like real carnival games you even get to trade your points for stuff like helmets,glasses, different clothes. Do buy."
3,Great game for the kids,"Got this game after receiving a Wii for my birthday in March. Have two young children and saw this as an opportunity to have fun with them. It's definitely a hit with them. Unlike some of the other games, the controls are easy to master for kids of all ages. The kids particularly like the horse racing, skee-ball, and milk jug toss games. Don't buy this if you're looking for adult fun as it won't be that challenging, but it's definitely one the kids will like."
3,Alright family game,"This game can take up to 4 controllers, and has lots of different games to play of various challenge levels. But my 5 year old didn't seem to get into it as much as I thought he would. Playgound was a better choice for him. My husband and I like it but find ourselves playing Wii Sports, or Wii Fit because they are more fun. Not to say this isn't fun, it is just there is only so much time in the day and, given the other games we have, this one seems to be the last picked."
4,"Great for kids, fun for adults, too.","I bought this for my kids (5, 6 and 8) because it wasn't fair to them that the only Wii games I had (at that time) were mainly for the adults. They LOVE this game, and I enjoy it too. It's not the most exciting game around, but at least it truly utilizes the Wii's special abilities. If you enjoy Wii Sports you'll enjoy Carnival as well."
3,Not one I would buy again...,"We purchased this game thinking it would be fun for the whole family. Though I must say the theory behind it is great, the controls are lack luster and the game play gets a little annoying. My kids have not taken it out of the box since our initial playing. There are a few carnival games within the game that are fun to play for a short time, but they quickly become annoying with all of the sideshow rhetoric that you have to do to get to them. This one is better left on the shelf."
3,Less than expected,"We thought that this game would be more fun. My 6 year old son gets frustrated with the difficulty in controlling some of the games. We still play it, but I just don't think that I would buy it again."
4,Wii Carnival Game Review,"Mostly my granddaughters, ages 6, 9, and 10, enjoyed this game, as did I. A few of the games were tough to figure out, though and not so much fun, or did not seem to run that smoothly. Good overall, though."
2,carnival games,"my son and I play a lot of games and this is not very interesting for him,as he didn't play it more than a little while when we first recieved it."
2,Not that good,"Me and my wife put in this game thinking it would be a fun and easy game to mess around on, but after playing each game on here...I'm done with it. It's not really fun to play let alone play it over and over again. Young children might enjoy this, but it's not for everyone. It's a shame because from the reviews I was expecting more, but I think this one will be traded in for something else real soon."
4,Good for kids,"I got this game for my 7 & 3 1/2 year old sons. Many of the Wii games are too hard for them, so I wanted something that wasn't so frustrating. Well, the 7 yo loves it, and asks to play it all the time. There's a large variety of games, all on the carnival theme (knocking over milk bottles, ring toss, football toss, skee ball, etc.) and you win small, medium or large prizes based on how well you do. My 3 1/2 year old has a shorter attention span, but even he is able to do some of the games, so they can play togeter until the younger one gets bored, then the older one can continue.Another nice feature is that the individual games are pretty short, so you can play for 15 or 20 minutes if that's all the time you have."
1,Something wicked this way comes,"I have been meaning to do a video review for this. But time is short and it is sliding by.Looking at the Wii ad you would think this game is going to be great fun at parties.Erhhh nope. This game either has controls that are too sensitive making the game impossible or too vague making you wonder what the point is.Usually I can pull something positive out, but really this game just ticked me off as yet another lame attempt to harness the wii controller.Save your money and pass on this one."
2,Does not keep my interest,This is the type of game that would be good to rent bad to buy. It is fun once or twice but past that it does not maintain any interest. I have pulled it out a couple of times for parties but after one game everyone is asking for something else. If you are looking for intense action that fully uses the UI of the Wii this is not the game for you.
5,Hi my name is Kai and I'm six and a half. This game is REALLY FUN! and I like it!,Carnival games is really fun and it has over 250 prizes and I like the games very much. It has six lanes. The game I like best is buckets of fun and hole in one.
1,"Good concept - controls are awful, ruining gameplay","If the controls for wii sports (comes with the console) get an 'A' for being easy and intuitive, then the Carnival controls get an 'F'. The concept is good, but when it comes to the gameplay, it is totally ruined by the interface. You will be disappointed if you buy this game; i'm surpised it is rated so highly."
4,Like going to a real carnival!,Great game for the whole family - games are very similar to real carnival games - complete with the frustration!
3,Carnival Games for Wii,"My 6, 7, and 8 year old grandsons were not very interested in playing this game. I think the adults played only because it was there."
3,Good Stress Reliever!,"I bought this game because it looked like a good way to get to know my Wii controller without getting killed by enemies. It was definitely fun at first, but after unlocking a few bonus games I started feeling like ""what's the point?"" because the games stayed the same (no change in scenery or level on most). I still use this game as a great mindless stress reliever!!!"
3,"It's OK, but not as fun as it looks","I love going to fairs and carnivals, so I thought this game would be lots of fun to play by myself or with friends. IN the end, it wasn't all that much fun. The actions you have to make with the controller aren't as natural as they could be, you don't have many choices at all concerning your avatar for the game, and there's no real incentive for playing games more and more (you just get more odd pieces of clothing for your avatar). In the end, it was a little fun but not fun enough to play often. I may end up trading this one in and getting something else to try."
3,My review on Carnival,"I thought this game was ok....It was a little hard for my kids to get the hang of but overall, they still had fun. I would not recommend this game for younger kids it might be a little hard for them to do some of the games on Carnival."
2,Okay,"For some reason, we couldn't activate additional WII remotes once this game was started. Not sure if this is an overall problem or an us-specific problem. We had to open up another game to activate all four remotes, then move over to this game.Fun because you can choose specific games to play alone or with up to 4 people, or play a pre-determined set of 7 games in a tournament format."
2,boring,my grandkids (3 total) did not really play with this much. They only found a couple games that would hold their attention for a few minutes and after one night of playing with it...they never played it again.
3,"Nice variety, but gets a bit old","There is a charm to this game, but the mini-games don't hold my boys' (aged 10 and 12) attention for long. For some throwing games, you have to wait for a rapidly moving dot to hit the right spot before doing a throwing action with the wiimote. It's an interesting solution to trying to make things challenging, but it isn't always appealing. You have to explore a virtual carnival to get to your games. Unfortunately, you can't use your mii characters here and the level of customization of your character in this game is very limited."
4,It's Fun,"When I was deciding what games to purchase for my grandchildren, this one came across. Now I knew that it was an older game, but I remembered the fun that we always had at Carnivals so I decided to give it a shot. At first everyone was a little taken back because they thought this was way to young and way too easy for them, but we were all surprised.As you begin to play the games, and there are numerous ones, you go up levels. Now, as you go up levels other games are opened up to you and they are not always easy. Who was laughing now? We have been playing it since Christmas and we are still discovering more things. It's a lot of fun, and it isn't as 'simple' as you may think it would be. Take for example shooting the guns. We are all pretty good at that in my family when we are doing target shooting outside with real guns, but we were not so good when we were playing this game, go figure!. All in all I really believe this is worth the money for some fun for the entire family."
2,Cute but overpriced,We enjoyed most of the games. The graphics were good but the games were far from challenging. I would think twice before paying the list price for this game.
2,difficult to play - multi player option is difficult,"I bought this because of the 4star review. Unfortunately - this game is not that much fun. The games are familiar, but the controls are difficult at best, and frustrating at worst. I would say save your money.At least the single player mode allows you to pick your games. Maybe I am missing something, but the multi-player game dictates your play and is irritating. Just our opinion."
4,Fun For The Whole Family - Recommended!,"""Carnival Games"" is extreamly fun, with over 25 mini-games and hundreds of virtual prizes to win (including clothing and accessories for your avatar).Just like a real Carnival, the games are divided into games of chance and skill. We really enjoyed ""Alley Ball"", ""Clown Splash"", and ""Shooting Gallery"". Some of the games may be too challenging for younger players, but most can get through the games.We play this with our whole family, since up to 4 players can compete at the same time.Highly recommended!"
4,Lots of Fun!!,This game is lots of fun! It is especially fun with lots of people. Many of the games you play simulateously--so there is no waiting for your turn. Lots of fun!!
4,Carnival WII Game,Really fun games on the disc. My four year old can play almost all of the games. Made for smaller children and not teens.
4,Fun for all ages,"This game was kinda fun for me (being 25) and my nephew (who is 5). It was a little easy in some games, but a bit tricky in others. Not my favorite Wii game but it is fun to play when I have a day off from work and the weather is to nasty to leave the house. My nephew had a hard time getting into it but once he did he had fun. I mainly bought it for when my neice and nephew come to my house to keep them ammused and they seem to enjoy it."
1,not as great as previous reviews,"I was very excited to get this game as I have 2 kids who love to play games on our new Wii. The reviews made it too hard to pass up for the price, but I have been very dissappointed. First, its extremely hard to find any games unless you have the booklet on hand to find out which heading each game is found under. The games are not listed anywhere on the game that I can find, so you have to refer back to the booklet each time you want to change games. The directions for each game are a joke. We spent most of the first hour figuring out where to locate each game and how to play the game, then once we figured it out, the games werent really fun, even for my 6 yr old.We opened this up, popped it in, messed around for about an hour or so and put it away unhappy and have not played with it anymore.Others seem to have liked this game according to the reviews, but my family has not gotten any enjoyment out of it at all."
3,It's just ok,"Let me preface, I own several Wii games (like over 50 or so) and this game is just ok. Granted I am in my early 30's but even my nephews and niece who are of all ages (6,9,10,12,15,17,etc.) and all have pulled this game out of my collection since it sounds like fun. Within 10 minutes they are all bored with it. It's not bad but it's just not a game that keeps your interest very long. I really wouldn't waste your money on this game. It's not horrible, it's just ok and I guess if I am going to own a game, I don't want any ""just ok"" games."
3,Good for mindless entertainment,This is a good game to have if you just need something to pass the time and not have to think about much. I haven't tried it in a group setting yet. That is part of the reason I bought this. If it changes my rating I will update my review.
2,Don't waste your money,This game is not very fun at all. My kids don't even enjoy it. Probably the biggest problem with the game is that it is not easy to control. Very hard for kids to figure out. Cover makes it look fun... Description makes it look fun... Wii play and wii sports are more fun than this.
2,OK I GUESS,Bought this game on the reviews.I like the midway games and they triedto make it similar and they missed.It does have some fun aspects to itbut all in all a c- game.Some games you can not use a shared controller.Others are very awkward to play.If the price is right it could makefor party game for your guests
3,Wii Carnival Games,Kids liked it the first time they played it. Not sure how much of a challenge it is for them. Product was in great shape.
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I am looking for games for a challenged child, not as easy to play as I was lead to believe."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this game would continue the fun and enjoyment of Wii Sports or Wii Play with various Carnival mini-games.It turned out be very confusing and hard to use. For example, we could not use the second Wii remote for player 2 and had to keep swapping the first remote between players. The backgound music is annoying and drives you crazy after a while. I also do not understand why they make you create your own player characters instead of using your existing Mii's.The kids asked me turn it off after 20 minutes so they could play something else. Very disappointing and not worth $50."
1,Not good,I don't see how anyone could rate this 5 stars. We rented this game for my 5 year old and the entire family grew bored of in within a few minutes. It even makes you create a new cahracter for yourself (doesn't let you use a Mii).
1,"Hard, Boring Games","Most of the games are very hard. For example, in dunk tank, insted of aming you wait for a target to hit the right spot, and then you throw. Also, the games get kind of boring after you play them all twice."
1,Wanted to Like It...,"Based on all the positive reviews, I really wanted to like this game. It's just that this game is completely shallow and mediocre at best. It was moderately entertaining for about the first 30 minutes or so and then gets extremely dull after that. On top of it all, you are awarded ""virtual"" prizes. That's pretty lame unless you're extremely bored or a tyke."
2,Fun for a little while and for groups,"Carnival Games has more than 20 minigames, each of which are pretty fun. But, they get dull quickly. You figure out the motions and timing you need and thereafter it's too easy to beat the games. The only benefit to this game once you have it down is that you can beat your friends! But, the control use is awkward; for most minigames, you have to take turns playing the game alone. My husband is very impatient, so one round of this game was too much waiting around for him to handle. I would suggest that you rent this game sometime when you have people over, but since it lacks replayability, I don't suggest buying it.Other notes: You can play with a lot of people, since you take turns. You only need the wiimote to play -- no extra controllers needed."
5,Almost Like Being There!,"This is a super fun Wii game, enjoyed by all. If you're a big fan of going to carnivals, this Wii game is a good substitute for the real thing!"
1,Wii Carnival...not that good!,"With so many games out there, I try to go by the ratings.First, the games were slow to go then not very easy to use and reaction times were very slow and hard to use. I have to admit, they put a lot of work into this but not worth it at all.Maybe I'm new to the Wii but after all the work, why do you have to create a new Mii for this game. That sucks!Can't take it back so hopefully a good Ebay item!"
2,Boring!,"I purchased this game because I thought my 4 & 7 year olds would enjoy it. All three of us found the games pretty tedious and boring. There's more to making your character than there is to the various games.Try Mario Karts or Wipeout for more action, adventure, and fun."
2,Not for Everyone...,"We received this game as a gift. This game is not for everyone. These games are difficult to play and it seems to cheat. The commentator is verbally mean. If you're not good at the game, he'll let you know. My daughter becomes very frustrated with this game. Most of the characters in the game are Caucasian. You're avatar choices are only Caucasian. Not pleased with this game."
4,"A blast to play, but why are there no people of color?","This is a fun game, our whole family is enjoying it, but when were making our characters we noticed that the only people of color are the carny workers. There seems to be no way to make a person of color to play the game. Maybe a minor nitpick, but my teens noticed right away that the people have 9 face options, not one is dark skinned! Fun game, lots to explore and dressing up you character in your prizes (like a hard hat or scuba tank) is fun! But it certainly could make some folks feel like they don't exsist trying to make a character that looks like them!"
2,I've seen better games,The game is not very entertaining for any age group. My child whose 7 lost focus after trying a couple of the games.
2,Not that much fun...,I had wanted this game since it came out and I finally decided to buy it this past week. It was not worth the money. The variety of games are just alright. Not that fun. The graphics are bad. I don't know what the point of the game is besides winning pointless prizes. I have a three year old and the some of the games are a bit advanced for him but he doesn't like the game anyway.
1,Modern Day Slavery,I do not understand how this game lets you edit a person but you cannot change the skin tone of your character. You can have fairytale elephant feet and ridiculous antler horns but you can ony play as a caucasion person. It is the 21st century and this game still has not gotten with the program.At first I shrugged it off unitl I started noticing the ring leader was always white and the carni who had to work the booths was black; in every game though. the only black people in the games are carni rode people. So they did have the technology to create people of color but chose to only feature them as modern day slaves!!!If I had not bought this racist game used from Game stop I would have taken it back the same day.
2,Booooooring and confusing,"Not a fan of this game. The menus are not intuitive and therefore the games are very difficult to navigate -- you have to pick a ""section"" of the park to go to but there is no indication of what sections house which games.Then once you are playing the games... they are... underwhelming at best.It's nice & tame game for little kiddos but really uninspired and... well... boring."
1,Ugh!,"Bought it to play with the wife and kids. Can't play it nearly as easily as many other titles. Poorly laid out, non-intuitive game play. And the set design (redneck) is just crass"
2,Beware of bad discs that freeze up your Wii,"I was very excited to get this game, especially so that my friends and I had something to play other than Wii Sports. We popped the disc and many of the games certainly seemed like fun. Unfortunately, the game constantly freezes, requiring me to restart the Wii by holding down the power button (the Reset button will not work). It always happens either when I'm choosing an area to go to (like Rodent Way, Fortune Way, etc.) or when I'm quitting a game to go back to the area I was in. Sometimes there is a loud screeching noise, which isn't pleasant on the ears.Overall, the games are fun to play...when they work. But the constant freezing means that this game is going back to Amazon."
2,Not perfect for every age,Being an adult gamer I found this game to be a bit boring and too repetitive as many game are quite similar to one another. Then having my nieces play (age 7 & 9) they found the games too difficult and had a hard time staying interested. It's an ok game but over priced for the amount of time actually spent playing and it seems like the appropriate age group that will truly enjoy it is hard to pin down.
4,Much better than expected! A LOT OF FUN!,"I was hesitant to buy this game, even after all of the positive reviews, but I did and I am glad. This game is so much fun. The games remind me of going to the boardwalk every summer and playing skee ball, and the frog jump, and the water balloon race. I haven't tried all the games yet, but the ones I have are great. Skee ball is just like the real thing!Is this a game like Halo? No, but it doesn't have to be. It is a great game for having fun and relaxing by yourself or with some friends."
2,BORRRRING!!!!! Save your money,"I bought this game with our new wii. IN a nutshell it's slow and borring. Were family type gamers, with a 7 year old girl. It's not interesting enough. Playground is a much better choice it's rated E and is action packed. We rented and have played non-stop for hours. Hope this is helpfull I was shocked at the good rating carnival received."
1,"Great in theory, awful in practice","What a great idea: take the fun of the carnival home! Fun for all ages, right? Throw a beanbag at the milk pails, toss a softball into the bushel, the dunk tank, etc. The problem is that the controls are so inappropriate that the minigames feel like random chance. For example, in the dunk tank game, instead of simply aiming for the target, you have to wait while a dot spins around, then time your throw to coincide with the dot appearing on the bullseye. Then the smarmy commentators make some wisecrack that you don't know what you're doing. This game gives me much greater appreciation for Wii Sports and Warioware. Returned this game to the store after about an hour. Not recommended."
3,"Fun at First, But gets boring",This game starts off to be fun but after you play it a few times it gets very repetitive. The only time I will play this game is if I have a party with a lot of people. This is a game definitely geared towards little kids so if you have a family with a lot of little kids I wuld reccommend buying it then because I do feel that they would enjoy it much more than my age group (teenager).
3,I would look elsewhere,I bought this game for myself and my 6 year old daughter. I thought it would be a game we could play together. The bottom line is the games are pretty boring for the most part. We did not get more than a couple of plays before we were looking to play something else.
3,Wii Carnival,"The graphics are not very good with this game and some of the games are hard for young ones. Overall, they like the game - but it's not our favorite."
2,Not Fun At All,"I was expecting carnival type games without the sleazy carnival cheating to keep you from winning the game. It is cumbersome to move from game to game. First you have to select an alley to visit, then you pick a game, then you have to listen to instructions on how to play. I'm not that patient. You can create you own on screen person but you can only be white, at least when you first start the game. I would not recommend unless your are trying to get you kids to read more."
3,Wii Carnival Game,"It's OK, but not as fun as they make it sound. Probably would be better for children, not for older adults, but it does help build up your accuracy skills."
2,Carnival Games,I played around in this for about 1/2 hour one evening. I didn't have that much fun and haven't played again since. I had a hard time getting the remote to work well with the games. It seemed a little off.Now wii sport and wii fit keep me entertained and I play those alot.
4,lots of games,"Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter. She, so far, has only played it a little but it was one of many birthday gifts. I think that later she will enjoy it. I've tried it out and feel she will like it since there are so many various games to try."
5,A great game for the Wii,I bought Carnival Games primarily for my young grandsons but find that I also enjoy it. A fun game for the whole family.
5,Lots of Fun,"I ordered this & had it sent to my 9 yr. old grandson for his birthday & he & his 11 yr. old brother enjoy playing it. They even used it for a ""Truck or Treat"" game at Halloween, where they gave out candy for the prices."
1,boring,I wasn't impressed with this f ame and honestly if I could find a way to get rid of it I would in a heart beat
4,An Enjoyable game,"I'm not someone who is really into playing games but this game is one I really enjoy. There are several games that I like to play in ""real life"" and it's great that I have the option to play them in my living room. My only problem I have with this game is some of the games are a bit difficult to maneuver with the wii remote this maybe due to my lack of experience however. If you are looking for a game the whole family will enjoy and are short and sweet then this game is for you."
3,Lots of menus to navigate through,"My wife and I have enjoyed the various games included, some better than others as you'd expect. We haven't played it as much because you end up spending so much time navigating the menus to get to the games. It's frustrating to waste that time when you want to play games. I'm less interested in the collecting prizes and unlocking ""things."" So that's also been a part we haven't liked. We paid $40 and it seems like it's more of a $30 game."
1,If you like games of chance and not much skill buy this game,First of all I bought the wii version and the ds version at the same time couldn't decide what one to buy. Love the ds version. If you like games with chance and very hard to control. By all means buy this game.very cheaply made. played 30 minutes done forever. Wanted the game so I bought it should have bought from amazon out $ 30 dollars. :( Very disappointed .Can't say much for this game. It is a hit and miss game. Wish I could be more helpful. Could have been better. save yoour money and buy wii sports resorts if you like Mini games.
1,Very disappointed.,"I purchased this game for my family based on the reviews on this site and I must say that I am very disappointed with this game. My family and I enjoyed games like Wii play and Wii sports and believed this game to be the same based on the reviews on this site. However, this game was a major let down. With this game your characters are limited. In fact, you cannot create ethnic characters only caucasian ones. Apart from that, the only games that my family and I enjoyed were skee-ball, hoops and the power hit game.... I plan on taking this lame game back to the GameStop first thing tomorrow and exchanging it for the ""PlayGround"" game ... For all those who are considering purchasing this game know this, if you enjoyed Wii play or Wii sports --- This game does not compare.... If ""PlayGround"" is as lame as the ""Carnival"" game is, I will be sure to leave my remarks concerning that game as well ..."
2,gets boring fast,"I think I loved Rayman too much to get into this one. I was expecting it to be faster, something new, and exciting, kind of like Rayman or the mini games on Wario Smooth Moves. If you like the games at the carnival then you will probably like this one. I thought it was addicting but at the same time it was boring. Maybe I was expecting the games to have a new twist to the traditional games at the real carnival, but not so. I did not like the fact that you can not use your mii and that the characters are all Caucasian. I do not look anything like the options that I had."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"DO NOT BUY CARNIVAL GAMES!!!!!!!!!I GOT THIS LAME GAME FOR CHRISTMASIT INVOLVES RUDE CLOWNSLAME GAMESNOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO WIN GAMESAND SIMULAR AND BORING GAMESTHE THIRD TIME I PLAYED THIS IT FROZE MY WIII STILL HAVEN'T FIXED ITI WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!DON'T BUY THIS GAME EVER!DONT DARE TO PLAY IT EVEN IF ITS GIVEN OUT FOR FREE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A WORKING WIIINSANELY MAD,"
5,Carnival Games for Wii,"Carnival Games is a blast to play. It has ALL of the old Fair/Carnival games you grew up with that they don't have anymore. Some games are very interactive, almost too much, but some of the games are much less, so it all evens out. I have been playing this for about a week or so and it has nice features to unlock certain advanced stages of each game. Overall, a good Wii, fun interactive experience."
3,Carnival Games review--it's okay,"My boys really liked the game for the short time they were able to play it. There is something wrong with it, and we cannot seem to find out what it is. I have emailed the company where I got it and they have not responded. I'm not happy about that! I'll keep trying. I'm sure my boys would really enjoy it, if it worked!"
3,"Fun enough, but gets old fast.","This game isn't bad at all. It's fun but it gets tiring really fast. There are a lot of games to choose from which you would find at a carnival. A lot them are very similar to each other. I just feel as it's a game that you play for about a week but then it just gets repeative and boring. There are things you unlock like things your character can wear, and prizes which you can basically just view. It just feels like there really anything that keeps me wanting to play it again and again. It's not a bad game, it's just in my opinion it gets old fast."
3,Fun but not great,"The game is fun, but definitly not the best game ever. You don't get to keep your Mii for the game, you have to create a new generic Mii. Basic games that use basic Wii movements, all revolving around typical games found at the ""fair"". Some are entertaining, but the kids (6,7, & 12) got bored rather quickly.I'd rent it first before buying to make sure you liked it."
4,"Recommend, fun family game","This game has been a great edition to our wii collection. This is wonderful example of a game that all ages can enjoy. I am sure over time it won't be as entertaining but I find that is true of all games. If your looking for a game that is easy to jump into, parents, grandparents and children will enjoy, our family recommends this one."
5,Good family fun!,"What a FUN game!! My eight year old son LOVES to play it! Very traditional carnival games that you would play at any fair or carnival! The graphics are good, and its easy to move through. The prizes you win are fun, and you can unlock funny hats and clothes to dress your avatar.We love it!"
1,Dont do it!!,"Sorry to say its really a useless dolly to replace your Stock Shop vac wheels, if your handy enough just grab some plywood and some decent wheels on bearings @ your local Home Depot and make your own bullet proof system....If your a Contractor this will break on you within the first days of regular use as what happened to me"
4,Tremendous 60's - 70's mid-pace soul,I bought this cd on the strength of one or two Northern Soul favourites but was pleasantly surprised to find an album of all types of great soul music.Most tracks are set at a mid-pace tempo but all are very danceable with a singalong quality.I can heartily guarantee that anybody with a passing knowledge of this singer will be well pleased with this excellent album.
5,The Cool in Soul!,"I am a musician and this music came out at a time when guys like Smokey Robinson and others were bringing a COOL kind of style to soul. The rhythm had such a jazzy groove and the vocals are intelligent and idealistic.As soon as I heard this tune on XM radio, I had to buy this CD. I grew up in Boston and there was a band in my neighborhood that used to play in this style and I have forever been influenced by it. The organ player brings so much color to the music and Deon's singing makes you feel like he's singing right to you! You can just see him standing up there in his pegged shark skin pants and jacket with the skinny collar snapping his fingers. I especially love ""Love Makes the World Go 'Round"".I'm not crazy about all the tunes on the CD but there's enough here to make it worth your while. I Love it!"
1,Try a different vise with LS1040,Reading the reviewer who said the part did not fit the LS1040 worried me. Checking the Makita parts list for the saw shows the correct part is 192625-5 (aka now 122536-0). The correct part is available on the web but not at any company selling through amazon.com at this time. I found it at ToolPartsDirect.com along with the Horizontal vise part# 122568-1
1,Says it if for the LS1040 but doesn't fit,"I bought this for my Makita LS1040 miter saw. It doesn't fit. The box says that it is for the LS1030. Needless to say, I returned it."
4,Sweat Hotel,"I recently went to Albuquerque, NM to see Keith Sweat in concert. He was the Headliner and when he performed it was standing room only. Throughout his concert he mentioned the Sweat Hotel DVD and the guest appearances by a lot of my favorite groups. Needless to say the DVD was great. I enjoyed all the performances by all the groups. He did an awesome job!!!"
5,Keith Sweat : Sweat Hotel Live,"This Keith Sweat dvd is great, its like being there at the Sweat Motel, he sings all of his hits and his band director is a star also.I suggest for all to order this dvd, a sure winner."
3,Ouais...,"Le son n'est pas terrible ,des ""Yeah"",""Love you baby"" toutes les 10 secondes...Je m'attendais à mieux.Bande son pour les choeurs et les instrus..."
4,Keith Sweat,"I love this CD,I love the guest he had on this concert. I am a big Charlie Wilson fan so I really enjoyed watching him and Silk did a outstanding performance. I love how Keith Sweat dedicated this concert to the late great Gerald Levert."
2,Meh.,"First surprise was that it was much smaller than I thought it was, but that was my fault for not looking at the dimensions.Second surprise was that the middle shelf and the right side were both warped. The end product is a wobbly piece of furniture with a 1/8"" gap in the middle."
4,decent quality for the price,Well made and went together easy! Would recommend... directions could have been better for those who may be less mechanically inclined.
4,use the wrench provided!,"i purchased 2 of these shelving units for my studio space. being the impatient person i am, i decided to use a drill instead of the provided hex wrench to get the screws in faster. BIG MISTAKE! i ended up stripping most of them trying to get them tighter. now i have to deal with a wobbly bookcase since i can't get the screws out either! having learned that lesson, on the 2nd unit i used the wrench and it went together like butter. they look great up and the color is just what i was hoping for."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this bookcase based on the reviews I read. I was very disappointed. It is made cheaply, the shelves are not level and the finish is very poor. It does fit into the space I have and with books on it is serves the purpose, but I would not purchase this item again."
2,Check you parts before assembly!,"I was excited about buying a small bookshelf for my spare bedroom. I was about to screw on the other side, but UH OH! My bookshelf came with 2 right panels. Therefore, the rear cross bars won't fit in right. I have to ask Winsome for a replacement piece, which will hopefully come in 2 weeks. If you have the money, splurge for a better bookcase - it will save you time, which is money in my opinion."
3,Bad Quality Item,"I received this product promptly after purchasing through Amazon. There was a crack in one piece of the furniture, so I was unable to put it together. I ordered a replacement part and received the wrong one. I was able to drill holes and make it work- but I would not recommend this product at all."
3,It is about what I expected for this price range.,"It was was packaged and arrived in perfect condition. Fairly easy to assemble. Once put together they a sturdy and have no wobble to them at all, which was my greatest concern. The finish, though attractive, is just what you might expect in this price range, certainly it is far from being fine furniture."
4,Good price.,"Great price with free shipping for a solid piece of furniture. One note - the grain of the wood varies and that causes the color of the stain to vary with it. Every shelf is a little different shade of espresso. Overall, it does matches other espresso furniture in the room."
2,Not Happy...,"I liked the design, the color and the fact that it is in wood. But the piece I got was defective and not worth the price. I had one short side defective at the bottom as if it has been eaten away, and it was chipped at several places.It will be too much trouble to wrap it up again, and ship it back so I may keep it. But not too happy :("
2,read other reviews for repetitive problems,"This was bought ""in a hurry"" as I was moving in the middle of a school semester, while working.The shelving unit came dinged on each piece and the top shelf has a generous splinter giving split 1/2 way down the shelf.I read several reviews that told tales of caution and a couple that more recently spoke of good things, so I took a chance.Mine does not wobble, thanks to repetitive review/tightening of screws. But it's not what I expected quality wise. Due to time constraints, I did not send it back, I turned it upside down, I still get the use of 4 shelves, and it DOES function as a bookcase, (hence the 2 star review). But buyer beware, you need to check each piece as dings seem to be the regular case with this item. There is a chance if you have the time, you'll need to send it/parts back. Once I'm done with school, the top shelf goes to the dump, and the rest goes to goodwill."
5,Love this inexpensive fragrance,I discovered this product line at my local Rite-Aid when I lived in KY. I ordered some for my friend in MI and she loved it too.
2,horrid,"All it smells like is alcohol, not even a sweet after scent or anything. I do not recommend this at all."
3,Not bad.,"Okay for more extra tunes if priced right, but so many better ones (audio and video) are coming onto the market."
3,Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary Large Print Edition,"This is a useful book. They were correct when they said, this particular dictionary does not include usage.'Concise' is the correct word to describe this dictionary. It's not made to be every day useful, but that's what it was advertised like.It includes lots of commonly used words from everyday, but some of the definitions are not to par with mindfulness and wisdom of the littlest child.This dictionary, almost hints at western philosophy and law, the dark history of mankind. But it has lots of helpful and kind definitions too.Could be re written by the littlelest child's mind so much simpler. Why haven't we published littlest children's definitions of words since their elementary days. . . Older can learn from younger ."
2,Definition of Concise?,"I was really disappointed with this book. I like words and I enjoy etymology. The precise word can make a poignant statement when used with stiletto accuracy. But, this book is babble using quotes to describe common and contrasting usage of a word. It has all the means but no end. There is nothing concise about this book."
2,frighteningly boring,"Owning this video myself, I want to say that this is an excellent title, but then I'd only be saying that to make myself feel better. While it's not the worst cartoon I've ever seen, it is the worst episode in my opinion. Of course, this could just be that I don't like the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" song. I like valkyries, just not the song. Anyway, rent it if you can before considering purchase."
4,Better than I expected,"Rented this one as the freebie in ""rent 1, get one free"" & found it better than Wrath of the Ninja(the paid rental). I rented a Bubblegum Crisis tape & couldn't get it out of the machine quickly enough, so I was pleased this one was so interesting. It's not groundbreaking or anything, but nice, entertaining fare, keeps the interest up, although one figures out the ""secret"" pretty much as the show starts revealing it exists. The lead characters were interesting & seemed realistic enough--not just something to show off the artist's latest scantily-clad fantasy in action. Kenji starts off more of a jerk than Dark Schneider's alleged to be by his show's title, but warms up realistically--not overnight or miraculously the day he meets his new partner. Hans is tragic & interesting, although maybe a bit dense--the average viewer should figure out his secret before he does(Kenji does). Worth the time"
4,It Grows On You,"I bought the AD Police remake after watching BGC 2040. This piece is drastically different. I found once I abandoned the question ""where does this fit into the 2040 storyline?"" I enjoyed the DVD much more. The style of animation is definitely influenced by film noir. The shots are well composed and the dialogue well paced. The storyline had some weak spots and it could have been a better series if they made it longer and fleshed out the story.I recommend this series to anyone who believes anime is art. It's also a great series to show a newbie who thinks anime is just for kids."
3,"Seems like a good product, some problems with damage & parts","I ordered this recently and just opened it up today. Based on a very minimal amount of usage so far (A few minutes at most,) it seems to be a decent and solidly built product.The reason I'm giving it a 3 star review is that mine which was supposed to be a new product (And was sealed in the retail box) arrived with an awful lot of cosmetic wear and damage on it. This looks like a refurbished item toward the lower end of the acceptable range, definitely not new.Also, it doesn't come with any accessories (pads, etc) right out of the box, so it's pretty much useless as it comes. It would have been nice to be able to use it right away. I think the description should have been a little clearer about that, I was expecting to be able to use it without spending more money on additional parts."
5,great polisher!,This polisher is the lightest weight one I could find. It works beautifully. Very easy on the arms and the variable speed makes applying polish so easy. The perfect machine for any polishing job.
3,From Blue to Red,"This is Leigh Stevens first solo album after leaving the super loud, original heavy metal group Blue Cheer. But don't expect more metal on this one. Stevens is still raw here, but it's pure late 60's psychedelia, especially evident in the raw title track with its distorted vocals and out-there lyrics. Portions of Yes's ""I've Seen All Good People"" sound like they could have been lifted from Stevens' ""Indians"". Nicky Hopkins' fine piano work in the instrumental ""Drifting"" makes this dated album well worth the purchase alone."
3,Good,"This sure is not the metal blast of Blue Cheer. Leigh Stephen's Red Weather is bassically psychadelic rock, with a few fuzz guitars thrown in on some of the numbers.Red Weather is definately not a bad album. The songs are average, but Stephens does add some falvoring: listen to the distoration on his voice on a lot of the numbers, which give the pieces an acidy feel. There is also some nice blues panio, infusing parts of the disc with a laid back, Humble Pie or Faces swagger.But there is no great player or singer to bring everything home. Nothing on the album really stands out. This doesn't exclude buying it. If you are a Blue Cheer fan or a 60s collector, this will fit the bill.You won't, however, be blown away. Just know that going in."
4,Remembering the P.I.,"As a former Navy Vet who spent more than 6 years in the philippines this movie brought back a lot of memories. I left just a couple years before the base closure. While this movie was not 100% accurate some of it was right on. Especially the blackmail attempt, and the semi-accidental killing of the filipino. While I was station-dito there were more than several instances of Filipine Marine or locals and Navy or marine sentries shooting each other and worse. The women were very enticing its true many of my friends including myself brought home Filipina brides (16 years and counting). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will definately buy it on DVD. BTW if you are reading this and remember me for P.I... drop me an email."
3,Goodbye America,I thought the acting was decent for this film. I thought Josh Brolin played a good role in it; as well as beautiful scenery.
4,slow-mo machine speak,"i put this in the deck straight away and thought, now that is strange, i hear the washing machine humming. it sounds to me like someone wiring up an electronics kit and putting a stethescope to the resistors, then the capacitors, then maybe over a diode to see what sounds come out.of the two tracks, colder still is more lively and disjointed. listening to this disc is like i imagine death in the cold, numbing, soothing and hallucinogenic if you can switch off, bludgeoning pain if you try to grasp the textures.the main melody and beauty here is in the beat frequencies from composite sounds that build up and release chaotically. clean, difficult, beautiful. two stars for wierdness and two for solid construction."
5,Developmental Theories,This book was not what I expected but a good read non the less.A good insight into racial/gender issues from an non traditional viewpoint. I would recommend it.
3,Can be Difficult to Understand,I got this book for a class- I a lot of the chapters were difficult to get through and very wordy.
4,Funny Romantic Comedy,"Very entertaining and funny romantic comedy, plays a bit like a 90 minute version of Friends or Will & Grace but well-shot and many cinematic moments. Acting was unusually strong, and the writing and pacing of the film were just right for the genre."
1,Original PARTNERS on dvd please !!!,My hopes were heightened when I typed in the wordpartners and saw that it was finally out on dvd.I was crushed to see that it was not the 1982version with John Hurt and Ryan O Neal.This is just a bothersome piece of fluff withacting that would make John Hurt cringe.Don't waste your money or your time on this one.
2,Poor translation from the German,"I *think* this is actually quite a good book in the original German, but the English translation is a joke -- almost bad enough to appear as if done by a computer. This is not just a quibble, since the text is do bad that it's almost impossible to follow the meaning. Here's some examples from Chapter 2 (and it's *all* like this)...""Some of the tags which are normally embedded in single commands can first be noted separately and subsequently referenced...""""Of itself, this element engenders no action. Later it will be bundled from other commands.""""It contains the class path which will be picked out by the system variables of the same name. Now the first target will be constructed at once. It contains the name main. Thus, it will be called during the start of the build file, since main will likewise be specified as a default target there.""Er, what?"
3,Lots of good code samples,"Interpretation problem? That would explain the less than perfect English in this book. It is not a terrible book but it is disappointing that it was not edited properly. Its easy to bash this book for not meeting publishing standards, but I give it 3 stars because you will definitely learn a lot of Ant. Lots and lots of good, short examples matching the CD. The book seems to have very good coverage/expertise on the technology. It is too bad that the grammar is not perfect, otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to give it 4 stars. So, if you don't mind the stumbling/stammering grammar and you are a patient reader that can read between the lines then you may be impressed with how much you will learn. This book seems to be targeted for the beginner or intermediate. Its more of a reading book and less of a reference book. I think this book is based on Ant 1.5.x."
5,"Light, effective sander","I've not used my sander very much yet, but I've been happy with it so far. I like the light weight design and variable speed."
1,Do not buy this belt sander,"I just purchased this today to scribe a countertop. Didn't want to spend close to $200 on a really good belt sander so I got this one from a pawn shop for about $60. It appeared to work fine as I initially plugged it up, flipped it over and turned it on. The belt seemed to turn with no variance so I did nothing to adjust it. I began to work on scribing my countertop and got about 3/4s of the way done when I began to smell something hot or burning. I stopped the sander, noticed that the belt had slipped over into the plastic casing and begun to cut into it. Now I have an unfinished scribing project and a waste of $60. Guess I learned my lesson. I should have gotten the best the first time. Wish I had read these reviews before buying this product. Please heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT."
5,The Best CD I Own,"This cd is great. There's not a single song that I don't like on there. I must listen to it, everyday. If your a club goer and you love that sort of music then look no further. This is the cd for you. I highly recommend it!"
4,Lots of fun for the geeky players!,"This isn't your typical hack and slash action-packed type of game, which is what I love about it. My girlfriend and I love playing this game for hours at a time. You basically have to go around collecting evidence, analyzing it, and interviewing witness and suspects...just like a real CSI! My gf especially loves it since she was a criminal justice graduate and works for the Philadelphia courts. It's pretty damn accurate in how things are done when investigating a crime. If you're a geek who loves trying to piece things together and as long as you don't mind a slower paced game, then you'll love this game. We even love trying to get all the extra bonuses, too! :)"
3,Fun game for older audiences,"I've only played the first level of the game so far, but it is a challenging game for older audiences. I could do without some of the language in the game- it's not really necessary to the plot at all. Other than that, I have enjoyed it so far!"
4,Point and clicky fun...,"I bought this game purely because of the ""solve-the-crime"" factor. I'm not really a fan of the CSI TV shows, nor have I played the PC version of these games. That being said, I really enjoyed playing this game for the Wii. You set your own pace and can really interact with game through pointing anc clicking around the screen. The main problem I had with the game is the loading in between scenes and locations. I also would have preferred more cases to solve, however I hope(d) there will be more sequels of these in the future."
4,Excellent Game,This is just a great game for all the crime-drama fans of the C.S.I. programs. My one and only down-fault with the game is that it could have had a few more cases to solve.
4,CSI Wii,"Love the game, although I can't really call it a game, more like a process study. Makes you think, that's for sure!"
2,CSI for the Wii,"They need to come out with more games like this, its not too bad. It is a little monotonous at times, and the game in itself is a little too short. But, if you like these type of games, you will like this one. One suggestion; rent before you buy!"
2,Clunky,"Slow moving, clunky game. It was hard getting started. Maybe it gets better after you play it, but it was just too tedious for me."
2,"Rent, don't buy","I'm a fan of the show, of science, and not a big gamer at all, so this seemed like a perfect game for me. However, it was disappointing, especially considering how good it could have been.My biggest complaint is how slow-paced the whole game is. It takes forever to load and save and the actual games take forever to do because you have to go from one scene to another ad nauseam.Also:-music got repetitive and annoying-Catherine's voice! argh!-there are still some glitches in the program, where it freezes, or repeats, or you can only click on a piece of evidence from a certain angle, even though you can see it from a different angle-several of the character's faces and even houses look alike - lazy-the ""bonuses"" are a complete let-downI do hope they learn from their mistakes and make an improved CSI Wii game, because I would love to play it."
3,Like the show- more of a mystery than a game.,"Hello, i only have the wii and i'm not an avid gamer.I like CSI the original show so i bought this game soley because of that. Overall, and i've yet to finish the first case, i like the game. It's definitly, not a hard game, the case is pretty much pre-determined. You basically just make sure to find the things and do the right things with them. It's a no-brainer game...but..it's like the show. It's basically like watching the show and being able to interact with it. Which is basically all i was expecting to do and find with the game- so i liked it.sum up: if your looking for an interactive version of CSI then you'll like the game, i did."
3,CSI,"Is a good game, but I believe that it could be a better one, and I don't understand why it was sent to me in spanish."
3,Skip a rope,I remember many years ago buying the vinyl album by Henson Cargill with Skip a Rope. I remember how impressed I was with that at that time. When I saw this album I decided to buy it partly from the point of view of nostalgia. I must say that my tastes have changed over time and whilst the album is entertainng it no longer holds the same appeal for me. If you want to listen to some quite good protest like songs in order to get a feel for the concerns of young people in the seventies and eighties then give this album a listen. I believe that many of the issues he sings about are equally relevant today. I don't regret buying it but I wouldn't buy another of his albums based on this compilation.
4,very good,This is a very good CD. I enjoy country music real well and expecially the older music. I would recommend it to anyone that loves country music.
2,Nothing new about this book,"I started to not even write this review, but since I purchased this book quite awhile ago, I have never done more than casually glance through it. The Bible is the only book of its kind and this is definitely not even a handy reference guide. Again, I hate to say anything bad, because you might be enlightened by it, but I would not buy it again. Sorry, guys."
3,its ok,hi we buyed this few weeks ago and i realy dont like it much its easy to install but when you put window up or down it got damage all 4 of them chip from corner so i strongly recommend dont buy it its waste of money
2,Blue Collar,"It was a bit of a disappointment. It was not as ""chrisp"" as I'd hoped. I've seen them all individually, but as a group, they just don't have the same""zip""."
3,A Family in Africa,"While I finished this book (and enjoyed the last half) and learned a lot of about Africa and scientific research, the insensitivity of the author to her surroundings ruined the experience for me! How can Kistner rave continually about the wonderful social whirl of the diamond-owners and fail to even mention the plight of the workers in those diamond mines. Same for the ""glamorous"" safaris. Not to mention the life-threatening danger to her children! Here she is -- for more than a decade -- exposed to perhaps the greatest of social and political upheavals, and nary a word except to lament that this wonderful way of life was changing! Read this book if you're curious about Africa in the 60s and scientific expeditions to remote sites w/ a family. But don't expect more than a limited, narrow report -- written as if the author wore blinders."
4,Good mid sized saw,"I got this saw to bridge the gap between a 7 1/4"" circular saw and a 16 5/16"" beam saw used to build a log house. The big beam saw gets used a lot, but you don't want to use it to cut on a wall or anything higher than your waist. The 10 1/4"" can go shoulder high without too much trouble, and works well. It has an all metal frame, which makes it a bit heavy, and it comes with a useless cheap stamped steel blade, but otherwise is a good tool."
4,Good mystery,The novel always kept you guessing. The characters were intriguing and the descriptions excellent. I enjoyed the dose of Southern culture.
4,Loved it,I wish this book was longer. I guess I will have to wait for the sequel to come out next year.
4,A good read,I really enjoyed reading this book. Anne Frasier writes a very addictive story about a string off murders involving TTX with an air around root doctoring and the mysterious air about that. There was a nice twist in the book just as I thought I knew who the killer was. I can't wait fir the sequel.
5,Strictly Top Drawer,"One of the best writers of mystery, crime genre out there. Expertly written and it will grip you right up to the last page. It's such a pleasure to come across a writer who has mastered t he craft."
5,Excelent Read,"I got this book at the time it was free, but if i had to pay for it I would not have regretted it one bit. The book gets you hooked as you start reading and has plot twist that keeps you right in there. I would recommend this book to persons who like a good mystery but also if you're not too emotional. The books plays on your emotions at some point and you almost feel like you're one of the characters wanting the plot to play out."
4,Just Enough Gore,"I enjoyed this book. Although as some others have commented, the characters were not very easy to get to know. But the descriptions of the ""dead"" or ""soon to be dead again"" was very good. Just enough to give me the creeps. but then, I like that feeling. Overall, I'd recommend it for the ""creepy"" value."
4,"What a great intro to the world of Anne Frasier! More, More, More!","I was cautious about this book, because some of the subjects that were covered are considered ""taboo"". After the first chapter I was hooked! Ms. Frasier did a REALLY good job of developing her characters, and I was in such suspense at what detectives would find next that I just could not put it down. There was language, but really none of it was used out of context. Elise and David had a relationship that I imagine many partners start with and end up with. It all seemed very real to me. I had realistic expectations, and boy was I not disappointed. I had some clue as to the basic ending of this book, but I was totally surprised by the particulars. That was nice in and of itself....having that jaw dropping/OMG moment. She made me want to visit Savannah again! I can't wait to read more from this author."
4,it's a very good book.,"Very good book... read it in one day (and practically in one sitting.) It's hard to keep me interested in books... I've got severe case of Kindle ADD... get all the books on the top one hundred list, read the first few pages, and if I don't like it, skip to the next book. But this one immediately drew me in and kept me going all the way through.I won't give you all the details of the books, since the other reviewers have done a better job of it than I could. Just get the book and read it.Would have given it 5 stars, but the whole voodoo thing kind of turned me off a bit. 4.5 stars."
4,"Very suspenseful, kept you guessing","Really enjoyed. Kept me guessing what was going to happen next and who was up to what. This ""bringing back the dead"" to entice the reader was really well written and keeps you not wanting to put the book down."
3,It was just okay,Good enough to keep reading but not enough to read more from this author. Not into all the voodoo stuff.
3,Good read,"For me, play dead wasn't a 'I can't put this down' until I got half way through, but it kept me interested the whole time. I have read some twisted books that just gross me out, but with play dead, I got to read about crazy people doing crazy things, without having to take a break because I'm so disgusted!"
4,Great Zombie Book,"Someone is turning young boys into zombie-prostitutes. Yup, sounds silly, but I assure you that it is a great book. The dark underbelly of Savannah is exposed in this disturbing tale. Young homicide detective Elise is determined to get to the bottom of these strange deaths, and to find out more about her late mother's special powers. To add to the difficulties is Elise<s new partner on the force who has his own disturbing history. Add it a strange witch-woman who the city both fears and respects and you have a great little mystery.A must for all Zombie fans!Relic113"
4,Play Dead,It had many unexpected twists and turns in it.It was a bit scary in parts but you also didn't want to put it down.You had to finish the book whether or not you wanted to.
4,Play Dead,"I really enjoyed this book. It was creepy and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I liked the characters as well. It was a little hard to follow at times, but at least it was interestng. I would have gladly paid for this book - but I was lucky enough to get it for free!! I can't wait to read more from this author!!"
2,She let me down.,"Ann Fraiser let me down on this one. After I read Sleep Tight i was determined to read all of her books, however, i've only been turned off. After reading the reviews for play dead i was just as excited to begin this book as i was to get to the ending of sleep tight. This book was not nearly as thrilling and quite dumb. If youve read sleep tight and had high hopes for this book, dont' waste your time."
2,Not my fav,"Confusing point of view issues and stale, repitive dialog made this one a dnf for me. I wanted to like it."
4,Enjoyed it...,I downloaded the sample of this on my kindle by mistake. However I ended up buying it and enjoyed it very much. I'm typically not drawn to murder/mystery style books but there was a type of suspense that kept me hooked.
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book. The summary and previous reviews made it sound very intriguing, and the setting of Savannah, GA made it hard for me to pass up. However, the descriptions of the city and its residents did not ring true to the city I know and love - seemed more like someone who had read a book about Savannah or maybe passed through the city once. I decided to overlook that personal disconnect, read the story as if it were set in a ""fictional"" city, and just enjoy the mystery. But I still couldn't get into the story because even the descriptions of mundane things - like Elise and Audrey (mother and daughter) having breakfast together, or Gould jogging, or Elise *thinking* about Gould jogging - just didn't have a natural flow. That, in addition to the stilted dialogue between the characters, made it a real chore to read. Simply not enjoyable."
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I kept waiting to more. I feel like more could have been said in each chapter to help piece together the puzzle. Perhaps even making a romance between Elise and David? Not sure. Definitely a good read. I would recommend this book to preteens."
5,Great read,Holds your attention throughout with a surprise ending. Story is not your everyday cop and robber mystery. I would recommend.
5,Wow! So many elements in this.book.....,"A murder mystery that covers so many topics: police investigations, the occult, divorce and the breakdown of the family unit, in depth character analysis, etc. Excellent twists and turns that keep you wondering till the very end of the story. A must read....."
2,Ok,This book really only got good at the end. Didn't hold my attention. Little character development. For me it's a pass.
2,Not for me !,I wanted to like this book but it just would not keep my interest . Maybe it was me but I must give it to you as I feel.
5,Better then the Rest!!!!!!!!,"Great Product. I have My Router upstairs, and I still get online with my desktop that is in the basement. With full connectivity. I have had 3 other major brand routers that could not do this. I highly recommend this product. Overall A+++"
3,More East Than West,"Those looking for a rigorous analysis of the connections between Western scientific thought and Buddhist philosophy will almost certainly be disappointed in this book. Although Nisker is interesting and knowledgeable when discussing Eastern thought, he too often settles for unsatisfactory generalizations about scientific research and theories, and suggests ""rough analogies"" (rather than clear correspondences) between the two. On the other hand, he does offer some fascinating insights into the biological and psychological interconnectedness we share with the rest of our world. Nisker's mental exercises and proposed meditation techniques make a worthwhile supplement to more fundamental and comprehensive meditation guides."
2,what's the point?,After reading Nisker's book I wondered what his point was. Is experience (and spirituality as well) reducible to physical events or is there some metaphysical reality encompassing those events? Lots of brilliance has gone into attempting answers to questions like this but you won't find much in Nisker's book.
4,A cool guitarists potential fulfilled,"I admit I didn't think he had it in him. Norum pulls a complete surprise and comes up with this tasty slice of guitar fuelled hard rock.Resurrection Time is one of the mans best tracks ever and Shimmer High is also great while being a little weird instrumentally. This has a little acoustic guitar, cover songs and quality originals. And it's a great album to have handy when you want to listen to something with feeling and not blistering metal.It's also brilliant to play to a mixed crowd as it's nice enough to please the non-rock audience, no expletives etc, just some great rock 'n' roll from a man who wears his influences on his sleeve. And an interesting cover of Sunshine of Your Love too..."
5,Just one word Killer,"John Norum smokes.His guitar playing is nothing less then awesome. This is a must have for any metal guitar player.His ability to write, sing and play guitar is something that should not be overlooked. Check out his other releases, most notingly Worlds Away and Face The Truth .I really give him ten stars."
5,Great CD,"I can't believe how many of you people pan this cd....come on...this is a great start for John Norum...the BEST thing he ever did was to go in a different direction..change his style a bit...everytime I listen to Total Control and Face The Truth...I feel like I'm listening to an Yngwie CD...He finally realized that he will NEVER be Yngwie...and found his own style with Another Destination and Worlds Away...Another Destination is his best work by far...Resurrection Time, Whose Side Are You On?, Strange Days, Spirit Days, and Jillana(a very good instrumental) are my favorites. I do like the first two cds...but this is his best work by far...Whose Side Are YOU On??"
2,Average standard,"The first John Norum solo album ""Total control"" was good, and the second ""Face the truth"" was even better. But ""Another destination"" is a bit of a disappointment. The songs are very average with the exception of ""Strange days"". Well, it's a decent heavy metal album and if you're just looking for metal music in a general way, I think you can invest in this one. But if you're in any way a bit picky and care about what albums to invest in, I strongly believe this one should come way down on the list."
1,Zero for effort,"I'm not saying that everyone in the world needs to know everything about Trinidad and Tobago but if you're going to try to make money from us at least spell ""Trinidad"" correctly (Check out the picture of the T shirt). Unless of course I've missed out on a spelling change for the World Cup?"
1,Triinidad? Where in the World is that country??,"Amazon, unless this is another country, Trinidad is spelt with two i's not three! Please do not sell or support vendors that sell products below Amazon's standards! I almost bought one were it not for DouglasinLondon's review!"
2,Defective,I ordered two of these filters. The packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box. However both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.I returned them for a refund.Metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent Toyota filters.Maybe a reason to use the bigger size.
5,These are the only filters I put on my Miata,Looked up the construction of these babies online. These are built with quality parts and the price is right. I'm going to buy the multi pack next time.
5,Another great Wix filter,I purchase these for my other cars and finally pulled the trigger and ordered it for my truck. Beats the FRAM garbage they sell at Walmart. It has metal end cap and the design is as close as you can get to OEM. Great quality filters.
1,wrong video...,"i ordered this video a few days ago, and just got it today. i'm guessing julio iglesies fans would like it, but it is NOT the video that is pictured beside it. maybe that's a mistake or something, but if your'e looking for what they have pictured for this video, please don't be fooled (like i was). i'm sure my one-star rating isn't accurate. i haven't watched the video."
5,Good Story,"It is time that India and Pakistan get the respect they deserve as nuclear powers. Why is it that France, Germany, Israel, the U.S., Russia, and South Africa (now supposedly non-nuclear) have been able to garner the respect that China, India and Pakistan are alluded by? Is it becuase they are not white Europeans? Nontheless, a well researched book."
5,An excellent insightful book,"As an Indian immensely proud of his country's accomplishments and having had to enter multiple debates with other non-Indians in May 1998, I gained a great amount from the book. It is immaculately researched and it seems that Perkovich has left no stone unturned. It goes into such depth and understanding of the Indian polity's psyche as previously unseen from a non-Indian author. Perkovich is not merely narrating a set of events which led to the testing but defending a theory that goes against current understandings of international relations and nuclear non-profileration by setting India as an example. I enjoyed every chapter of the book and hope that current policy makers in the field learn from it. A must read for every Indian interested it their country's policies and others making policy for the rest of the world."
5,Great!,"We saw this cutter being used at a winery recently. I looked online and found cheaper foil cutters, but decided to go with a few more dollars and got this one. I love the ease with which it fits into my hand and cuts almost magically. No more dulling my good pairing knife when opening wine bottles."
4,Impressive and Solid,This foil cutter not only looks and feels solid; it really works. So far it cuts through most foil without a problem. It is really different from the plastic ones I have used for years. I highly recommend it.
1,Doesn't get the job done,The cutter is big and heavy--all the things that sounded good in the first review--but it stubbornly refuses to cut through the foil. I think the problem is that there is only one moveable cutter (under your thumb) that is used to press against the other cutters and I can't generate enough pressure with my thumb against just that one cutter to cut the foil. I press and turn and press and turn and it scores the foil but doesn't cut through. You need more leverage to get the job done. Not recommended.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Being a long time Chris De Burgh fan, it's a little disappointing to see less of the great old story songs on here and more of the newer romantic ones. While I do enjoy the newer as well as the old, I don't think that they did a good job of showing just how much this singer has evolved over time. His family really changed his music, and it shows. I would like to have seen something like ""The Tower"" or ""The Painter"" on here."
5,The Best of Lady in Red,"I love this original rendition of ""Lady in Red"" and am delighted with the other songs presented on this CD."
1,Very Tuneless,Chris De Burgh was a Poor Man Cliff Richards.This Disc is Sappy &Boring.He Can't sing&The Music is very Bland.How Did He ever get a Deal?
4,Long Live Chris!,"I'm so glad there are still people out there who can appreciate great music such as the works of Chris DeBurgh. Although He hasn't been in the Spotlight lately,His music will be in Our hearts forever. ""Don't Pay the Ferry Man"" is my favorite, Hard driving music never to be done again by ANY One but Chris himself!, Thank-You Amazon, I truely enjoy your site!"
5,Well worth it,"This blade doesnt cost much, but it does do a good job. It produces clean, smooth as glass cuts time after time and lasts a while. I highly reccomend this blade for use on any miter or radial arm saw."
5,Amazon Freud Radial Arm Saw blade,I have a Craftsman radial arm saw and this blade works great on it. -5 degree angle rakes means a nice even pull without fighting climb. Smooth edge on crosscut angles. Can't do better than that!
5,The beast...,"This is a very solid and sturdy sander. I used it to sand a butcher block counter that I had cut in half (thickness) from a huge butcher block. Starting with 24grit and ending with 150grit, it really did a number. Very powerful... you have to really hold on. I even rigged the dust catcher to my shop vac.. very nice."
5,One powerful sander,"Almost bought the variable speed but less powerful cousin. Glad I didn't. This unit works great. It's heavy so you won't want to do much vertical or overhead work. One reviewr commented that it wears out his workers and I can see why. An hour is the must I can go without a break. But you can get a lot of sanding done in an hr with this tool.Much quieter than my old Sears unit. Dust collector works surprisingly well (but I wish they offered a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit removes material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner.Probably 3 times faster than my 3"" Sears and more stable with 4"" footprint.My past tools have been Bosch, Milwaukee, and Dewalt. But I bought Makita's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed. Bought this based on that experience and great reviews. Very satisfied."
5,Greatest book of poems I have read since Helen Steiner Rice,"This book is so great that it will inspire, uplift your spirit, and help you to celebrate your life. Reading the poems from this inspirational speaker gives you words for all occasions. Whatever the occassion, Corine Patterson, a new writer captures your sentiments and touches your heart. There is a song by the title ""Speak to My Heart, Holy Spirit,"" and this is exactly what this new writer does. She expresses your senitements when can not find the right words to say."
4,Bloody good time,"Just streamed this honey again . Have the dvd though . The dvd HAS English subtitles . The lengthy brain surgery is certainly a highlight . I dig the look of the hairy hell creature . Such ample lips . Not half bad lookin' with them new peepers either . Scarygoofyfun . Half a swell double feature on a hot summer's day . Not for nothin' , but my 2005 Dvd and Video guide by Martin and Porter states ""The release of Hammer Films veteran Terence Fisher's final directorial effort would be a major event , but for one thing: this is the censored TV print , not the R rated original"" . ""But the out-of-print Japanese laserdisc merits three stars"" (out of 5) . Has anyone seen this version ? If so , drop me a line and give me the straight dope if you would . Thanks ."
3,A new bizarre turn...,"A young doctor is sent to an asylum for sorcery when he has been using dead bodies for research based on Baron Frankenstein's studies. He ends up in the same hospital as Frankenstein did several years earlier, and he meets Dr. Carl Victor a.k.a. Baron Victor Frankenstein. Together they continue Baron Frankenstein's inquiries into the human body and life after death, but it takes a new bizarre turn. Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell is an interesting story in the sense that it uses science in a peculiar, yet realistic, manner for its time. However, it does not save some of the awkward moments in the film that diminish the horror and leave the audience with an average cinematic experience."
4,not bad,if you like that no limit - cash money soundthen get this - WATCH DEM HATERS IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS I HAVE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME.
3,Work Needed!,"The songs are either really good, or really wack! For his secomd album, he is improving. Oh, yeah, watch out Mystikal! Thug Addict is ""Unpredictable!"""
3,IT was ok,This was an ok cd but definatly dont' spend 15 dollars on it. There were a couple of songs that sounded good. But all of the other ones didn't have that good of a beat to rap to. i also didn't like how he was always talking and not rappign like jay-z does
5,A true jewel !,"Excellent selection of Mozart Family music. It's amazing to listen father, son and grandson together in a CD."
4,Nice to finally see a hardbound edition,"I purchased both volumes for my library. The cover art could be better, but that's not the issue. The book size and print is smaller than a standard Hardcover edition for any of the other books, especially the Mallorean series. The story is 5 star, but I wish they published it using the larger ""standard"" book size."
3,Semi contact - Great. Full? You'll need tape.,"I used this while I was training in MMA. It wasn't bad, but it has a tendency with sweat to move if the head is struck too hard. A great shape, but a bad choice in material. This was somewhat remedied with tape, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're practicing with semi contact, and that might be sketchy depending on the strikes as well."
5,cook book review,I have owned this Holiday cookbook for at least 10 yearsand it's fantastic. I am now buying a copy for my parents'cause they are hooked on a couple of recipes and want their own copy.
1,Disappointed buyer,"The graphics are not in sync with the music. I requested an exchange of the CD thinking that I had simply received a bad copy. However, the second one turned out to be same--bad quality and out of sync."
3,Disappointed when it arrived.,I was so excited to receive these I ordered 2 sets but when opened package 1 of the 4 coaster was broken so now I only have 7 instead of 8. I'm not sure if I can even glue them back together.
4,Look and perform great,"I have Thirstystone coasters already but was looking for them in a southwest theme for my done over basement. These are terrific..absorb moisture from glasses and protect my furniture they way they should and look artsy at the same time. I leave them out because they just look good (instead of hiding away in a drawer until needed.)Update: my husband took them out of the small box (not the shipping box) they came in and discovered there is a piece of a coaster missing but strangely enough..no pieces were inside the small box they came in. I am not pleased, as they were obviously shipped this way if there were no small break off pieces inside. Will call Amazon on this, as this is unacceptable. It was a gift for me for Christmas."
4,Nice but gritty,"These coasters are very nice. They are heavy, attractive and match my decor perfectly. The only reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is they are kind of gritty but they work as they should, absorbing any liquid when your glass sweats. The grit is actually a good thing as it keeps the glass from attaching to the coaster like my old coasters did."
4,Thirstystone Coasters,"Would have given 5 stars because I like the product, but the product was shipped with too little protection and one was cracked."
2,Colors are VERY different from pictures,"These look rich and muted with a gorgeous, brown sun in the pictures. In reality, the sun is more of an inky, ""purple-y"" dark color with lots of reddish/peachy tones and some purple in the back.If you are looking for neutral, muted, rich tones, this is not it! The do look good against blacks, etc. I have Raku lamps... they look crackled in black on off white background, and these coasters look surprisingly good with them. But, still, not at all what I expected.)I hope this helps someone else making a purchase decision."
4,"Easy, clean sanding","This is an easy to hold, low vibration, less dust sander. I use this sander for a variety of tasks. I find it easy to load with paper. Since I am a woman with smaller hands I find this sander is more ergonomic and less stressful to hold. The top hand hold is smaller and I experience less hand fatigue. In working in tight spots this sander works well, especially in corners. The bag for dust collection is okay, but it could be larger with a tighter weave so less dust escapes. Overall I have used many sanders and I would recommend this one over the others that I have used for similar sanding needs."
2,Makita Palm Sander,"I bought this sander two years ago. This Makita sander does a good job with final sanding chores, as long as you are outdoors or don't care about noise and dust. The sander is loud, has poor dust collection, and comes with no vacuum port. The plastic interior frame on the dust bag broke causing the bag to occasionally fall off. For the money spent, this sander has been a disappointment."
2,low noise??,"Review said low noise, low vibes....maybe they did not pack the padded gloves and ear muffs in the case. It is horrible. besides down time to load is a joke unless in the last 2 years makita come up with a better solution to the spring tabs. I shutter every time I need to sand an inside corner to something. I do not like it, never have liked it, and never will like it. If you need one go to a store or trade show and buy one that is quieter with less vibration. TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT. I do not use it unless I absolutely have no choice. As for dust collection anything is better than nothing. My suggestion to avoiding the dust....don't use it."
4,Good Bang For The Buck,"Replaced an aging B & D orbital sander with this little gemReplacing an aging Black and Decker orbital sander with this little gem was a great move. The higher rpm ability of the Makita cuts my finish sanding time in half. Due to its lightweight, sanding time is only limited by the durability of the sand paper. Only time I stop is to change the sheet, which takes only a matter of seconds with the pre-cut paper and clamping system. The agronomical design fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. Only minor draw back is the location of the on-off switch. Sander can inadvertently be turned off during use."
3,"Good, Not Great","This is sander is adequate for many purposes. It's lightweight, relatively smooth, and easy to set up and use. Replacement media is inexpensive, using 1/4 sheet of standard sandpaper. However, I've retired mine in favor of a Porter-Cable 333PK. This one is a little underpowered for rapid sanding. The dust collection leaves much to be desired. Overall, it's an OK sander, but if you can afford the extra $15-20, I'd go with the P-C."
2,"Sands well, but not durable","This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards. It works well when new, but lacks durability. Even in a non-professional setting, it just doesn't last. The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place. The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order. It does sand well, I just wish it was more solidly built. If you need a solid finish sander, you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models."
5,Celtic Wicca,"Very well-written and informative. I enjoyed the book very much, and found the history of the Celtic gods and goddesses, with their complimentary rituals, to be especially good. Also, Ms. Raeburn describes the way the Celtic deities and the Roman deities became intermingled as did the cultures in a way that can help one follow the sometimes tangled web of changing names of various gods, goddesses, and demi-deities."
5,THE KILLER,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A COPY OF THIS RECORDING FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I HAD IT ON A DOUBLE RECORD VINYL LP BACK IN THE MID 70'S , WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, AND SOMEHOW IT GOT LOST. THE KILLER ROCKS! JUST LIKE JERRY'S CURRENT RELEASE, LAST MAN STANDING, THIS ALBUM RECORDED IN ENGLAND IN THE 1970'S, FEATURES JERRY LEE WITH SOME GREAT BACKUP AND PLAYING BY OTHER GREAT MUSICIANS. THIS RECORDING FEATURES SOME OF ENGLAND'S BEST ROCKERS FROM THAT ERA; THE WHO, ERIC CLAPTON, RORY GALLAGER, ALBERT LEE, AND LOTS OF OTHERS. A GREAT CD."
3,Pam Anderson,"I'm a huge Pam fan, but was not overly impressed with this product. It is something I'll hang on to, but will probably hardly watch again."
4,I lke this CD,"I like this CD. most of all, that it has Tennesee Birdwalk on it, probably that is the best known hit from these two. I must listen to this CD a few more times to determine what I think of the quality of the recordiing. first time around it sounds pretty good."
4,Power House of a Saw,"The new Makita Saw is an excellent choice for those with a lot of work to do. It is extremely well made and with the powerful motor it should be rugged enough for commercial use. I have used it on three differant projects and the tool has surpassed my expectations. The only reason I am giving it a 4, instead of 5 stars, is the instructions are not concisely written and they should have provided the rip attachment for the price they want for the saw."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I purchased this book to begin a study of Reformed Theology, and on the whole was not dissapointed. Dr. Sproul is very clear and engaging as a writer, and it is easy to understand.My dissapointment comes with the 2nd part of the book, where he discusses Calvinism. He tends at times to obfuscate the meaning of the more objectional doctrines (Unconditional Election, Irresistible Grace) so that it doesn't seem so harsh, as is the typical objection to Calvinism. Also, he paints all semi-pelagians in a heretical light.A good introductory text on Reformed Theology (which is more than Calvinism). All Christians will benefit from reading this, not just those in the Reformed camp."
4,"Good, but not perfect.","As Michael Horton has said, ""I always agree with R.C."" I would also tend to agree with him. Theologically R.C. Sproul is right on. I enjoyed this book to due its easy reading and short length. It lays out the Reformed Doctrine in a manageable fashion, as well as giving a good introduction to five point Calvinism, with opposing Pelagian and Armenian views.I do take issue with the work which is seriously lacking exegetical support for all the doctrine laid out. I would suggest this book as helpful but neither sufficient for anyone desiring to learn the basics of Reformed Theology or students and pastors who want to use it as source material.Like I said, I enjoy the relatively small size of the book, but that is precisely the problem - it is just to small to be a catch-all source for the Reformed tradition. Though I don't suspect it was meant to be."
2,"Great Book, Bad Condition","The book was great, but I did not recieve it in the condition described. I was purchasing this book as my sister was the illustrator so was wanting a better copy."
3,Good but not great Christmas CD,"I hoped to find some Fred Waring stuff that sofar has been unavailable. The good news is some of it is here. That bad news? Most of these recordings are obviously dubbed from electronically re-channeled stereo along with a heap of artifical reverb. The original engineers of these recordings were excellent. The music is still great, but hey, why can't it be restored to its original lustre?"
5,Beautiful music.,"The collaborations (and the effort) gone into this CD shows on the tracks. If memory serves me correctly, I believe even one was done in A.R. Rahman's studio. Beautiful sound."
3,"5 days in, it's great. EDIT: 1 year later, meh","Noticed the effects immediately, and haven't seen a significant drop in effectiveness since then. If you read this review in 30 days or so and I haven't updated with a fuller story, add a comment and I'll see that and update.-- UPDATE August 19, 2010 --So as you can read in the comments in this review, the initial perceived effects of sustained attention and lack of fatigue wore off within a couple months, and could well have been placebo effect. On the other hand, there were no negative effects, so if you've read about this herb online and you want to see if it works for you, I can't dis-recommend this item.For reference: I have not tried any other brands or preparations."
2,Just not seeing any benefits.,It's not a miracle cure or magic bullet. Remember when Ginseng was THE latest thing??? There are no adverse side effects. My suggestion is: go see your doctor and have a physical instead.
3,"Great at first, weak effect later","Not sure if it's the body developing tolerance but, when I first started taking this product I was really happy and impressed with the results. But now when I take it, it doesn't really do anything.It's definitely true (at least at first) to avoid taking it before bed."
2,Barely Noticeable Effect,"Rhodiola works great. When I ran out of MIND BODY & SPIRIT, I picked this up and a couple of other brands as well. Couldn't get the same Rhodiola lift out of it. While another reviewer has good luck with it, I think that may be because she hasn't tried anything else. This product just doesn't have much going for it. I had to double up on the dosage to get any noticeable effect."
2,Interesting literary references but impractical names,"The names in this book are mainly for those searching for ones with strong literary ties. It is not good if you are looking for a ""normal"" name, nor if you are looking for something that is just less common.Most of the names are simply impractical and unweildy for a child now.I found it least helpful of all the books I purchased."
4,The sniper game,"This book was about a house that was given to Janie Madison, the main character of the book. Janie turned the house into an apartment to rent out to old people. A sniper was after all of the people in the house and wanted to kill them all.I liked this book because it was twisted and it was hard to find out who the murderer was. I enjoyed reading this book because it is full of action such as when the sniper kills someone it tells how he is going to kill the person. This is a good book to read so read it today!"
3,It was pretty good.,"I liked this book though I found it almost childish and I don't know why at my age I still read books like it. Some parts were very predictable, the charachters didn't have much depth and I hated the writing style. It did though have an interesting plot over all and it was different than any other book I have read, but believe me I've read better."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,"Most of you probably wont get to read this book, because it's out of print, but it is still the best book ever. I've read all the Harry potter book, 1-4, and I even finished #4 on 1 day (over 700 pages long) but The secrets of dragonhome is better. I hope a sequal is made. It is about Talents, humans that have extroadenary powers. Like flying and such. But talent have 2 go off to war. Melainse (a telent) died, and here and her brother are forced to try and find a long lost relative. Somehow they wond up on the enemies side, and everything unamagenable happens."
3,Pretty Good,This book had a great storyline but it didnt make sense in some parts and the romance was horrible. Lord Sander was 30 years old as it said in the book and Melayne was 15. They fell in love. The fact that Melayne was the only one to ever stand up to the humans wad unbelivable. The humans treated the talents awful and they didnt at least try to mutany before. Howevwer I am just stating these things to point out that this wasent the best book ever written. It was a kids book. It had a very good plot and is worth reading because it does pull you into the book and keep you wanting more.
5,THISS BOOK WAS SO GOOD I COULD HARDLY PUT IT DOWN!!!!!,"I was so interested in this book I could hardly put it down after the school buses, in school, at home, at my best friends, and in the car that is how intense this book is and how it will change your live and how you look at it. I think you should really try this book because it is so good you do not ever want to put it down until you complete it.I still have not completed it yet because I lost it and I can not pay for it on this site and can not find it anywhere close. I think anyone could learn to like it if they like dragons, wolf, talents, and mid-evil things like sword and exc.The first few chapters are a bit boring but you need to read them to get the barrings for this book. Did I say this book is deep?"
5,awsome,"this has to be one of John Peel's best books, and you have to agree after you read this book that he must write a sequel. oh, for anyone who hasn't read it and love fantasy or a more historical fantasy book, then you will most likely like it. all of my friends loved it. i hope you will too p.s. good luck finding one(they are hard to find)."
5,A super cool book,"I picked this book up a long time ago at a book fair at my school. I didn't read it immediately, but when I did, I loved it! This is one of the best books I have ever read! It has everything: action, adventure, romance, suspense, and mystery! I have read this book more times than I can count and still love it everytime. I'm going to have to get a new book soon because mine is falling apart! I really wish that John Peel would write a sequel to this! I wanna know what happens on the Far Islands!"
2,What are you guys smoking?,"Okay, this book was amusing the first time I read it. Needless to say, I was seven. Now that I look back on it, is so full of plot holes that it's not even funny. It is out of its time too. I mean, come on, matches? Where would the heroine get matches? It is so obvious that the author did not feel like taking the time to add a decent substitute. And they just go around disrupting everything and getting away with it, with absolutely no consiquences. I must say though, it was an interesting between-book filler."
4,Great and thrilling...keeps you turning the pages.,Great book. Makes you keep turning the page. Can't stop reading it.
2,It's Alright...,"The plot is juvenile, the characters are rather flat (but they have so much /potential/!), and the things that go on are generally a bit unbelievable, but it's an easy read and relatively safe, if certain analretentive parents are worried that little Mary might find out what sex is. The romantic subplot is decent (and Lord Sander is actually quite drool worthy), and Melayne's brother is a spoiled rotten little brat. Dragonhome is slightly-more-than-vaugely reminiscent of the ""The Immortals"" quartet, by Tamora Pierce (Immortals is better). All in all, this isn't the best book I've ever read, but not the worst either, and I thank Mr. Peel for starting me out reading the fantasy genre. Fair warning: the end calls for a sequel which (unfortunately) doesn't exist."
5,You better Believe it,"I thought that this book was awesome! Yes this book may be called Fantasy but it had Adventure, Romance and everything else in it. I just wish that this book would've come out with a sequal! I give this a definate 5 stars!"
4,This was an excelent Book!,While I read some of the other reviewers comments I find myself relating to most that I read. I thought this book was wonderful. I couldn't put it down! I do wish that a sequel would come out of this book. I would LOVE to read another one about these characters. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because of the way the characters acted. Yes they were good don't get me wrong but I found myself thinking that the same things were being repeted over and over about them. Ex. Melayne always fogiving here brother and blaming it on his age. Come on that gets a little old after a while. But none the less I loved this book. I'll recommend it to all of you to read. And if by some chance the author reads this PLEASE make a sequel!!!!PS I didn't check for spelling errors so if I spelled something wrong... well we'll just have to deal with it OK?!
5,A very mystical and suspensfull novel. A page turner,"I think this is a very interesting book. It is one of my favorite books. It keeps you hooked up, and is a real page turner. You really enter the book, and get to know the characters. Sometimes you cry, sometimes you laugh."
5,LUVED THIS BOOK,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A GREAT WELL WRITTEN STORY,I DEFINATLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE.IT'S FAST AND FUN READING.IT HOLDS SECRETS AND HAS SOMETHING FOREVERY ONE. I JUST CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS BOOK! :)"
3,Mildly Intriguing-from a 15 year old reader,"I began reading this book awhile ago and when I finally finished it I was a little disappointed I have to admit. For one thing, I thought it was a little unrealistic, a bit too trying-to-be-modernized in the way the charicters expressed themselves at times, and at some points disturbing. I was also disappointed with the lack of dragons until the very end, but that's just me;)In short, I enjoyed this book for mild amusement purposes, but the writing style is not too brilliant. It was such a relief to return to the book I was reading at the same time: Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austin because the writing just went so ""allong the grain"" rather than against it.I'd highly recommend Anne McCaffrey's Pern Series-this is a woman who knows how to write! The stories are also brillinat and filled with dragons! (hehe.)-Blonde In Black"
5,Too Good For Words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book makes your fantasies come true! I couldn't stop reading no matter how late! It is in my opinion the BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!
4,Torn on this one,"On one hand I love fiction which pushes the limits, but on the other hand the story was kind of lame. The language flowed well so I never felt bored or irritated while reading it (although as I have said in other reviews, reading is a personal experience in which a reader may connect with a story). The violence was over the top and some of the scenes were hard to read. However, since I never sympathized with the character, even at the end, I never really cared. Maybe this was the intent or maybe not. I would recommend mostly because I love extreme fiction. If the character had been developed just a little more and the story elaborated on in certain parts it would have been a five stars."
5,Best mouthgaurd for wrestling,"If you have a wrestler with braces, this is the best mouth guard we have found."
5,This mouth guard is legit!,"I am surprised at the general level of apathy out there (outside of football) about mouthguards. Maybe that explains the lack of products that work with braces. Tough to find a product that my son can actually use without it falling out of his mouth. We got by with a typical boil and fit guard that we replaced every two weeks to avoid disturbing the teeth, but that was for the top braces. Now that he has bottom braces, this is the only one I've found that covers the bottom braces and allows talking (yelling) without falling out. And his brother uses one for Tae Kwon Do. Bonus points for being able to pop it in immediately without boiling or other fitting. I was skeptical of the one-size-fits-all approach, but I tried it myself, and my two boys also tried, and it fit us all just fine. Sometimes the simplest ideas work the best."
1,low profile design misleading,"If you want to do some rough grinding this sander can handle the job,but if you want a nice flat smoothly sanded panel,""forget it"".This sander is very unstable and I would of given it a lower rating then 1 star by far!"
1,Not for little dogs,"Our Pomeranian puppy had no interest in this item unless I was waving it in her face (which I could do with a paper towel and she'll be interested). Also, the ball (which absorbs water to freeze) was too big for her to fit in her mouth, so she didn't chew on it while teething. I ended up just freezing a wet hand towel folded in half for her to chew while teething. One of our other (larger) dogs then chewed the streamers off this toy, so it's also not very durable.I probably should have looked at the dimensions more closely before I ordered the product but I just assumed that it would be smaller since it was for a puppy. *sigh* Money wasted."
2,Not for all puppies,"I purchased this toy for my three month old Rott/Lab mix puppy. He seemed excited when I gave it to him and he ran into the other room to play with it. I threw the packaging away and followed him (it was less than a minute) and by the time I got to him he had six of the knots chewed off the ends of the strings and I could only find four. This would be ok for supervised play, but definitely should not be advertised as a ""teether"" as it will not stand up to a lot of chewing. The two missing knots did turn up the next day as a colorful surprise during our morning walk."
4,Well received,"Our four month old puppy loves this item. He has torn a small hole in the fabric ball, but it doesn't seem to be getting bigger, and he absolutely loves the fabric ties. They are a great teething comfort for him."
5,Having a ball!!,"My westie pup loves this toy. It's his favorite, by far. Great for playing fetch and tug-of-war. A must have!"
4,Quiet Amazing!!!,"Well i dont listen 2 too much punk rock, and just like many i use to think that good charlotte are like ne other useless punk rock band out there, but this album has really changed my opinion of them. It's more mature, the lyrics are deeper and more easy to relate 2 and some of the songs actually have a heavier sound.These guys have really had a different approach to there music this time arund and that results in an album that has something to offer for evryone,even those narrow minded people who dont think higly of good charlotte.It's a really good album and deserves to be checked out!"
1,YUCK!! This sucks!,I hate Good Charlotte all they do is complain...Their lives cannot be that bad if they are famous!!! They are total posers! I would give it 0 stars but it won't let me
3,More of the same ... X2,"I looked forward to this album coming out for some time. When it finally did, I was disappointed to see the shady marketing ploy engaged here. They've set it up so you have to buy two copies of the same album to get all of the bonus material which is pretty low on the distributor's part. The ""Death"" version is exactly the same except for the 1 bonus cut. As has been the custom with this band, the record has bonus tracks--some listed, some not. If you let the CD play LONG after the last song finishes (the listed bonus track) there is a 2nd, acoustic bonus track at the very end. As for the rest of the album, I thot a lot of it sounded much the same as the last album. Some of it even sounded like the same songs only with different words. Not their best effort. If you're a 1st time buyer, I'd recommend their older stuff before these two."
3,An Angsty Saga,"I've given up my Good Charlotte fan status and tried to chuck my ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" CD ages ago. It's kind of personal, but I just kind of outgrew them.Anyways, on this CD, I think the only song I like is ""Predictable."" I was resistant to it, but it wore me down. The speech-rant part in the middle cracks me up every time. Sorry, Benji and Joel. I know you showed vulnerability, but that whole ""You're never coming back!"" stuff makes me laugh.It's not really good, and not my favorite thing ever, but it's fun to sing along like angst-filled pseudo-punks (with the windows firmly closed, to keep our cred intact, of course)."
1,THIS IS NOT PUNK!,"I am so pissed off at hearing people say that Good Charlotte is punk rock! THEY ARE POP! Good Charlotte are 4 posers who think they're cool just because they're in a band! And all of Good Charlottes fans are nothing but posers if they think this is true punk. If you want REAL punk, then I highly highly highly recommend: The Ramones, Rancid, Less than Jake, and The Clash. I know this review is gonna get a bad rating because, I know that there are a lot of freakin idiots who like this crap. If you agree with me on all of this than support this review, and let everyone know that this is not true punk, and people should not buy this!"
1,unbelievable,"............ok so there first single 'predictable' made me sick i do not like that song at all i would rather listen to a dead horse being beaten with a wet cat, don't ask why i just said that, then there second single came out 'i just wanna live' ok the guitar in the chorus sounds pretty cool the bass line is alright but when he started to sing, especially in the chorus..............you know what i'm not going to go there. just don't buy it please do it as a favor to mehave a nice day"
1,Not them,I personally found the Chronicles of life and death life version VERY dissapointing. It is a complete let down. The album is rediculous and sounds nothing like the other album what so ever. They should be ashamed of them selves. It sounds closer to pop then it does to rock. Another thing is the songs all sound the same.
2,an honest review,"first of all, why two stars? because these guys don't suck as bad as simple plan, and at least they look kinda cool (stress on the ""kinda""). now that i've gotten that out, i must say that they aren't very good. they don't make good music or write good lyrics. they pale in comparison to green day, weezer, offspring (their early stuff). if you want to listen to something new and good at the same time try ""the used"" they're produced by the same dude as GC. they're superior in everyway and i believe that it's only a matter of time before they get bigger than GC. wait for it!"
1,how can any one like this,i was never a huge fan of them but their second album was pretty good. What went wrong?? I heard predictable and thought it was ok so i got this crap......its disquesting. I think people just give this 5 stars because they are obsessed fans and don't want to admit that they went downhill...badly.Lyrics: Pretty good 6/10Musicaly: They suck...I'm a begineer guitarist and learned about 5 songs in a day...they are not talented face it 4/10Also what is up with I wanna live. Its horible and should be taken off the album. The people who like his song are listening to the wrong genre...u don't want punk/pop u want pop/rap its just horrible...So don't get or listen to this album get someone to burn u a mix with only there good songs
1,SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Look Im gonna make this short,sweet, and too the point. Buy there first 2 albums if you want some real rock. This is soul music mixed with rock which doesnt sound good.SUMMARY:DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE (...)ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!!"
1,Lame,"If you're even reading this review that means you're probably considering buying this CD, well don't. Good Charlette blows, they lack any real talent and are probably the biggest group of posers to come along since Limp Bizkit. Anyone who's even considering this CD has no real taste for good music, and is probably mildly retarded. Actually I take that back even a retarded person wouldn't allow themselves to be subjected to listening to this crap. So why don't all you punk rock posers do us all a favor and go crawl under a rock with you're s***ty music because the rest of the world is sick of it."
1,"Boo Hoo life is so hard, were so rich.","How could you make so much money and still pretend to be a depressed teeny wannabe punk? Good Charlotte is incapable of ever creating true musical art because they have no credibility to begin with. Punky beats are not creative, playing the same four barre chords over and over again is so incredibly cheap and easy. Real music is hard to play and much more creative. Someone needs to tell these guys that there is so much more to guitar than moving up and down the fret board. If good charlotte wanted to be taken seriously, they should stop pretending to be so artsy when all they make is pop punk crap. I believed them when they wanted to be Blink and Green day clones, but now they want to be respected? LOL, Now thats unbelievable."
4,Good Stuff...,"I have never been a GC fan, in the past when a song came on the radio, I turned the station. Then one morning I heard 'I just wanna live', I really liked the song and thought it was catchy and wanted to know who sang it, much to my surprise it was Good Charlotte. I got the CD last weekend and I can't stop listening to it. They have grown up musically and I love the keyboards/orchestra in this album. You can call me a fan of this band now."
2,What were they thinking?,"Before I completely bash on it...ill point out the good things. There ARE a few good songs like chronicles of life and death, SOS, Walk Away....ya thats about it. And the lyrics are more meaningful and theyve gotten more mature. But is that what their fans really want? No, fans dont wanna hear about how we should feel sorry for tehm because everyone hates them, they want songs that are fun and upbeat. They arent anything like punk anymore. This is radio-pop,hip hop. They had a huge fanbase and they blew it. I can understand pop-punk changing to metal like blink 182 and sum 41, but hip-hop??? If your a Food charlotte fan, dont buy this cd. just burn SOS, chronicles of life and death, walk away, and maybe predictable."
3,ok not best,"when I first herd this I thought what happened there last albumn was there greatest, this cd is okay my fav tracks are ""Predictable"" and ""I just wanna live"" there becoming to pop!!!!!"
3,good but not their best!,this album is good and sucks. some songs are cool and some are weird as hell. good charlottes last album the young and the hopeless was definitely their best. the best song on the new cd is predictable but it was on the radio alot so it kinda got played out like all the other of millions of songs in the world. this cd is only 3 stars because they could have made it alot better instead of rushing just to get another cd out but hey they are the ones making the millions of dollars for their music and we arent so i guess they must be popular according to other people.~David D
3,Going the wrong way!,"Good charlotte really are going the wrong way with this album. Their last album was way better than this, but a true fan should buy this album. Good Charlottes last album had alot of meaning (lyrics) and so does this, but its darker, more gothik, more depressing. Dont get down from this album, live life to the full. SERIOUSLY! do what you want to do, just enjoy your life!"
1,freakin crap,Good Charlotte is terrible. Another band like Green day who thinks they are punk. They arent they are pop and they suck. Just face it gc fans you only like them because people you think are cool like them. (...)
1,What IZZZ THIS?!?!?!!?,"I am- excuse me; WAS- a hardcore Good Charlotte Fan, but when I stuck this CD in, I almost cried! The lyrics are really good, but I didn't buy the album to ponder life and death!The whole album is nothing but orchestra and the lead singer praising himself to piano music! I think drums and guitar were used twice, MAYBE three times on the entire CD!If I wanted to listen to Beethoven, I would have bought Beethoven! If I wanted to listen to Piano, I would have bought Mozart! And if I had wanted to listen to a CD that basically focused on the singer, I would have listened to Britney Spears! But I didn't! They have lost their own sound, and I was very tempted to just throw the CD out the window on my way out of the parking lot of Best BuyPleeeeease don't waste your money on it- you will be disappointed if you expect the old school GC sound."
1,"""Pop"" is not a dirty word.","First of all: Yes, Good Charlotte sucks. Need that be said?Secondly, there is an awful lot of ""omg GC suxx0rz their pop LOL!!!!111oneoneshift+one"" being spewed in reviews. Contrary to popular (no pun intended) opinion, there is nothing wrong with pop. Have you ever heard the New Pornographers? Modest Mouse? The Arcade Fire? The Starlight Mints? They can all be described as posessing the qualities of ""pop,"" and I'll venture to bet that none of them are remotely similar to Hilary Duff.Even though Hilary bangs out some amazing death metal these days..."
1,Why do i even bother listening to these guys,"These idiots suck! This is what Green Day meant when they say ""Don't want to be an American Idiot"" it means listening to these guys is a waste of money and time this is how I feel about Simple Plan too, it'll save me the time."
1,"first off, explain 'punk' to me!","Before my review, I'd like to ask what 'punk' is? Good Charlotte never qualified as 'punk'. I don't think a 'punk rock' band likes to host MTV's TRL. It's pathetic. I gave this CD a listen because someone suggested it to me, what a waste of an hour that was!! They don't even sound like the same people who sang ""Little Things"" or ""Fesitival Song"". (Yes, I did enjoy their first album) And what's up with the window-breaking high notes? I never did think that this band could sing well, but now that I've heard this album, WHOA! These boys cannot sing to save their lives. Good Charlotte hasn't done much to boost my interest in them, let alone my confidence that they could one day become this great band. Spend your time listening to music actually worth listening to like Britney Spears, *NSYNC, or even Aaron Carter... anything is 100% better than this garbage."
1,this is one of the worst albums ever created,"This album all around sucks. There is nothing good about it. I loved Good Charlotte's first two albums. But this is complete crap. Go buy there old stuff. It's some of the best new age punk. But this is a disgrace to Good Charlotte fans everywhere.Please GC, don't make your next album like this."
1,??????????????????????????,"Why do we all have such bad taste in music. Seriously, what is so special about this band? They try to dress all punk and hardcore when really, their music pretty much tells how they really are: A whiny, pussy little vocalist and his untalented band members. Please, do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this pop rock, incredibly mainstream sh*t. Listen to bands that pretty stay clear of mtv. Listen to all bands that formed before trl and the poser sh*t they show. Bands like Metallica, Megadeth, rage against the machine, iron maiden, Pantera, Slayer, Scorpions, System of a down, Judas Priest, Slipknot, or even ac/dc, and black sabbath, and basically the list goes on because all these bands know how to sing and especially play thier instruments.[...]"
1,Manufactured rubbish,"this opitomises the supposed ""punk rock"" scene of today. Oky they may have written the songs but its basically pop with direction and an image. This cd is a complete waste of time"
1,Best CD I have ever heard,"Well ok so its not. This might be the worst so called music I have heard in awhile. I liked some of there music before their first CD was there best they still sold out than and still are. I guess you could like this CD if you were 14 and mad at your parents, but other than that give up on these guys they are done for."
1,"-5 stars, thats NEGATIVE FIVE STARS!","Good Charlotte has sucked horribly ever since their sophomore release. Those of you who pine for the days of ""Little Things"" turn away now. OK, so they thought theyd try o be ""artistic"" or something and in the process somehow (though not unbelievably) produce this extremely poor excuse for music. Does anyone out there actually still like these guys??? They need to just stop...because they suck. Every track is boring and unoriginal...its really downright disgusting. do NOT buy this album, i repeat do NOOOOOT buy this!"
5,Some good stuff XD,"This cd is awesome. Along with the other Good Charlotte cd's it relates to regular life and is a deffinte buyer. In this cd you will hear some interesting songs on just life in general. "" I Just Wonna Live "" is a popluar song fron GC** featured on TRL. Plus if you watch MTV music videos you will see that they have a least one song played every day. Maybe i love GC's new cd because I am a GC fan and love these guys like crazy you may hate them just because they are a punk/rock group. But trust me if you actually sat down and listened to the songs and read the info on the cd case you will begin to love this band and connect with there music. Well thats it I hope you enjoy this cd as much as I do !! =)"
3,"Typical pop-punk, bland and unoriginal","I have this theory about pop-punk; ""If you've heard it once, you've heard it all"". This album is no exception. Everyone complians that GC turned dark, but i disagree. Aside from SOME of the lyircs, there's really nothing on here to make it stand out along side Simple plan, Nfg, Mest or Yellowcard (Mtv's new favorite ""boy band""). The music, overall, was okay (alothough songs like ""I just wanna live"" and ""ghost of you"" have terrible chorus') and a few of the songs even make minor strides to step outside of the box (i.e. the screaming in predictable). When bands like Blink 182, Green Day and MxPx first came out, I loved pop-punk. But now in days, it seems like anyone with a guitar and power-chord knowledge can pull it off, and that makes it REALLY dim. The last pop-punk record I got really excited about was TSL-Say it like you mean it. This falls far short of that one AND many others in its genre."
3,The next Backstreet Boys,"I loved Good Charlotte's last cd so I was excited to get this one. I bought it for a road trip to Florida and it sucks!! Look at their punk appearance and their last cd... they were great. Now they are mainstream, boy bandish. I hate the cd and thought it was a waste of money. I hope their next cd has a little more punk flavor to it. I'm going to keep my hopes up."
5,"Beautiful, Gorgeous & Amazing....depressing though...","The Chronicles of Life & Death is AWESOMELY gothique and dark and i think its a whole lot better than The Young and Hopeless which is like....more soft punk rock. This album is depressingly addictive its like, you hate listening to it but you love it as well. Buy it- you won't regret. BTW, check out the S.O.S , Wounded, and um.....the whole album."
3,"Alright, but ....","This album is okay, but it's nothing really special and that's saying a lot since I typically have been a huge Good Charlotte fan. I respect that they're trying to evolve and grow up with their music, but the majority of the songs on this album are not very creative. They're not necessarily bad, but I expected more from Good Charlotte than this."
2,To set the record straight,"There was a kids review a few down from me that says for real punk check out fall out boy or rise against.Both this band and those bands are NOT punk. They are punk rock (if that), which is totally different. Now i don't like this band or fall out boy which are abit to ""my girlfriend broke up with me"", but i think rise agaisnt a breathe of fresh air in this shallow punk rock world. Anyway, punk is dead i hate to admit but it is. Punk is the misfits, sex pistols, dead kennedys and so on. This is NOT punk, this is poor punk rock.Anyway this cd is fairly bad, it has it's high points but their more like medium points. This could very well be the band that caused the flood of crappy imatation punk rock bands. I don't like good charlotte or the people that call them punk, learn your music history before you start labelling music and yourself."
2,*Puts in CD* What the?!,"I will tell you right now, when I first listened to The Young And The Hopeless, I fell in love w/ it! But The Chronicles Of Life & Death sounds like something from The Backstreet Boys or Nsync! EWWW! I dont know what happened to this great band, but they definetly have changed there genre from rock to pop! I will admit, a few of the songs are good, but for the most part, its just way too pop for me!"
1,0 Stars,"This is absolutely the worst Good Charlotte album yet. Dont waste your money. I have been a fan since before they hit mtv. Their first album self titled ""Good Charlotte"", was by far the best album they made. The last one was bad but this just tops the charts. The only album i recommend to by is their first album before they got big, its always any artists best album. I can listen to that cd all day long the whole cd through there arent many albums nowadays that u can do that buy the first one u wont be sorry."
1,stick a fork in them - they are DONE,"I will spare everyone the song-by-song disection of this album - it is terrible from front to finish. I'm still a big GC fan, espeically of their older stuff, but this new album reminds me of the couple of songs on their last album that were poppied-up overly contrived and trying way too hard to sound like new wave 1984 eat your heart out. Rating: F"
1,OMG....what the heck happened here!?.....,"i really loved gc's 2nd CD but in their 3rd one they really washed out....i only heard Predictable and We Believe on the radio...i loved Predictable but We Believe is just not punk...We Believe sounds like some scary 1/4 punk 3/4 prep hybrid.i came on amazon.com to just hear the rest of the CD because i was thinking of buying it, but i found only one i liked...PREDICTABLE...in short GC could have put much more effort into this CD....MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT....."
2,Not as good as before,"I enjoyed their first 2 albums, but this one is just to pop-ish. Predictable is the only song I like on here. And GC isn't punk... but don't hold it against them. They're mislabled, that's all. So all you misfits can stop complaining how this isn't real punk, because it clearly isn't. Take GC for what it is: a decent pop band."
1,I Would've Given IT a BIG FAT ZERO,"I must admit, that I USED to be a good charlotte fan, back in the day. (They're first album was good.) But when this came out, wow, what a load of crap. The first two singles off this album were fairly good, but the rest? Crap. The songs all sound the same! And I hate that! I could'nt even tell which song was which.Do not (DO NOT) buy this album. It's a waste of your precious money."
1,Worst music i've ever heard.,"dont tell me everyone has there own tastes. Because i heard nothing talented on this album and the only reason you are listening to it is cuz it is on MTV and the radio and half of you listen to it you think your punk and punk is trendy, the other halfs musical taste is not mature enough to realize that there is no talent on this cd. I know punk is not about being talented, but if there is not instrumental talent there is song writing talent and a cause. these guys wine about girls and they are in it for the money. Pop is easy to write, so these guys figure out how to play power chords and they become millionairs. See, thats how the pop industry works. And the Good Charlotte fans are just being sucked into this scam so a bunch of losers can make some cash. Now im not going to pass jugement on you as a person, im just saying that you should wake up and relize what your listening too and then buy a minor threat album."
1,What a Joke,"as a person who lived through the REAL punk rock era of the late seventies with bands like the ramones, the clash, the jam and the buzzcocks and sex pistols hearing this cd made me both laugh and cry...this stuff is awful, anyone who wants to hear real punk rock....PLAY THE RAMONES..see the difference here is that the real punk rock was rooted in the sixties, this stuff is rooted nowhere, what a bad group and there are so many others out there just as terrible including green day who actually look like a comedy act....go on amazon and buy the ramones....im done"
3,wow,"Ok im not trashing the album nor am I endorsing it. But I can deffintly see how they would be ""selling out"". The Chronicles Of Life and Death sounds like a cradle of filth album, I mean honestly. Life and Death I can understand but The Chronicles? Im not totally hating on the band though, they are from Maryland as am I and no matter what level I dont like them I still have to respect them. Maybe there making a turning point like every other band and making more serious stuff (Blink 182, Sum 41, Green Day). Maybe in the future thell figure out what kind of music they are comfertable with."
1,they have to stop,"What is this?? all these punk...pussy bands sound like a bunch of teenagers in a garage band that have no talent. listen to the lyrics, sounds like sonnie and cher. dont listen to yellow card, blink 182, new found glory, or this. Try listning to Metallica, Stevie ray vaughn, Children of bodom. guns n roses, motorhead, even nirvana. Real music"
5,Good Charlotte Rock!,For all the people that think Good Charlotte is just a 5 boys band playing in the garage with no talents than you are wrong. Good Charlotte is the best and the song I just Wanna Live is the best song i have ever heard so for all the people that think Good Charlotte is not a real band than GreenDay and all the other band sucks. I love GC.
1,Crap Crap Crap,WTF happened to Good Charlotte this CD totally Sucked I went to buy Punk and got POP music this is the Kind of crap Britney Spears listens too
1,Tips on how to enjoy this cd,"""Warning, please do this with adult supervision"" First buy album second place cd in a vice grip third grap bb gun aim and enjoy. Buy Sublime, Pennywise or Bad Religion and old Green Day instead."
1,It Sucks!,"All the cds this band has made suck. Not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made. Blink-182, Sugarcult or Sum 41 are good punk-pop."
2,Just need to say some things,"okay. first of all, how isnt this cd rated like, 1.5 of 5 stars cause every review is 1 of 5.Why does everyone say this is the worst band out today?? I could name a lot worse right away: 50 Cent, THE WORST band Simple Plan, Hawthorne Heights, Destineys Child, all rap, and definately Slipknot, because, they, worship, the, devil. which is sick. Even if they dont, it sure sounds like it from their music and lyrics.This band would actually be decent if they could play the guitar better and make some songs that arent made to just sound cool and catchy.For REAL,great, music get Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the not mainstream side of Foo Fighters."
5,awesome,"i think this is an awesome cd from good charlotte. you can listen to this cd over, and over, and over again, and still not get tired of it. all the songs are really catchy, except maybe ""the battle of life and death"". i personally think that one's kind of creepy. however, all the other songs are great."
1,wow.....,"i can't even begin to describe how horrible this band is....i mean it's just impossible to put into actual words. the english language simply lacks the adjectives to describe this band's unbelievable ability to suck. i'm not even angry at this band, or it's predominantly 14 year-old, MTV-addicted girl fan base, any more. now i just feel sorry for them. on both the surface and underneath, this band is just phenomonally bad. they're just this day and age's Sex Pistols (a band who's members were trying WAY TO HARD to be what the mainstream had come to define as ""punk"" and who existed solely to exploit it). like the Pistols, this band has studied other bands, stolen their look and style, and are now getting by exclusively on that look, with no recognizable talent in sight. wow....it should be illegal to release music this bad."
1,Well I'll Be Damned...,"Well Good Charolotte proved me wrong again, their music could in fact get worse, and here it stands before you. This band is one of the worse bands ever, I was always sure that mainstream 80's music was the worst ever but no, Good Charolotte up'd 'em and is now holding the titleS of WORST MUSIC EVER, WORST BAND EVER, BIGGEST POSERS! Congrats guys you earned everyone 10 fold. Anyways, THIS IS NOT PUNK, THIS IS POP THROUGH AND THROUGH, you want punk get Dead Kennedy's, Dropkick Murphy's, Flogging Molly, Oi Polloi, Ramones, to name a few, download some of that then read how foolish you were to call these tools punk. HA!"
2,Sub par pop/rock,"If you want to hear the pop/rock music that is written with females in mind, this album is a good one to pick up. Simple arrangements, lame lyrics, no soul or energy in the singing, and repetitious. You'll get very bored with this album."
2,Not for me.,I did not enjoy this release. I do not wish to elaborate. I just wanted to remove the immature review that I had left here years ago.
1,"to Kahsee Rivera ""Kahsee","OK First off this album sucks major balls and ossibly the worst relase in the history of music. Well Kahsee Rivera Kahsee who ever the hell she or he is she acts liek she pernally knows the band and im sure a bunch of other hardcore fans would say the same, well you dont kno the band what so ever and she siad "" One of there dads walked out on x mass eve"" well it was benji and joels dad who walked out on x mas eve, so they both lost a dad. When this happend GOod Charlotte was being formed and they were a HARDCORE GROUP yes they were once metal, so all you hardcore gc fans, bet u didn't know that. So the put out a lot of hardcore stuff then a record company told them change your music for a million, and they did it. GOod Charlotte are sell outs and only make the music they are told to, soa ll you people who act like you kno them you dont so shut up and stop acting like you do."
1,this is just ridiculous!,"Ok old GC fans we had all hoped that they'd grow out of this mainstream 80's craze they were in for the last album but no, it is all a lost cause now. I think i might go burn all my GC cd's, merchandise, photos and autographs! No wait, I'll keep the autographs to sell to you little teenie boppers that actually still listen to this crap! Because we all know it'd be impossible to get an autograph from these fame-obsessed posers now! Good Charlotte has officially become my definition of sell out! It's a shame we can't go back to the days where not only did they make great music but they played great shows! This here coming from someone who began listening to GC back when the self-titled album first came out, the only album worth your time and money is that one. Their first album is the only one that truly comes from the heart and that they wrote for the people, not for the money!"
1,Britney Spears!,"What the f is this? Good Charlotte used to be ok, but this sounds like Britney! Maybe they will end up like Ashlee Simpson dancing like a clown on SNL. If you want a good cd, get GREEN DAY'S American Idiot."
1,Oh man! Oh man!,"This cd's awesome! It changed my life completly! F*** Pink Floyd and Yes! This cd's gonna change the world!!!Hopefully you didn't take any of that seriously...stop calling these guys punk! Black clothes and eyeliner and body piercings don't make you punk, your music does...and don't say:You're just jealous because they're famous and you're not! You know who you are...out..."
2,No good. Just no good.,"okay, not entirely awful. Just really generic. I see a lot people here really like (or have liked) these guysat one point...and also seem to like Sum 41, Blink 182, Simple Plan, etc...all generic. You carelessly throw around the term hardcore, pop-punk, punk...none of this falls into those category.Look into bands like Screeching Weasel, the Queers, Anti-Flag, NOFX, Pinhead Gunpowder, Mr T Experience, White Flag, Operation Ivy (who later became Rancid, who later became, partially, the transplants) Catch 22, Snapcase, Bracket, Against All Authority, Hatebreed, and early Green day...when they were on Lookout! Records. (everything after that is just a rehashing of the same 3 chord progression with...and not in a traditional punk rock way)early Less Than Jake, Suicide Machines and more recently, the Blackouts (now Living in Blue)That, my friends, is good punk / pop-punk / hardcore."
3,Good -- temporarily,"This album is not bad, but after a while, the lyrics and just the whole sound of it got on my nerves. A few of the best songs would be ""Predictable"", and ""We Believe"".Well... it's pop, so what can you expect?"
3,Missing the Point,"So I've read over these reviews, and I've noticed most of them lean toward the opinion that Good Charlotte is a pop band, and other bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Megadeath and the Ramones are so much better, blah blah blah. Well, this may be true. But people are missing the point. Stop comparing GC to genres that they don't fit into. People who like those bands most likely aren't going to like Good Charlotte. People who like ""sucky"" or ""sellout"" music like Blink-182 and Green Day are the Good Charlotte fans. The point of these reviews isn't to tell people what kind of music to listen to. With that said, this is a good, fun, pop CD. It may not be the most spectacular guitar playing, and GC may not be the most revolutionary band out there, but last time I checked music was about having fun. So for anyone who is more interested in checking out a pretty good band than in being a musical snob, I would say go ahead and check out the CD...it's definitely worth it."
1,Not good at all,"I am sick of people calling Good Charlotte EMO music!!! Just becuase you have Nightmare Before X-Mas tats, black hair and lip rings does not make you emo.Anyway, I don't like the music at all. It's too mainstream MTVish. If you are a girl between the ages of 12 and 16 or a wanna be emo boy buy this. Otherwise, burn it -_-"
1,GOOD? Shar-let.............,"Hmmmm, I heard of this band from my little sister, who really likes this band. If she liked them, I might give them a try and actually listen to some of their tracks. What the? First they do not rock at all and there music does not match the way they look! If you want the most emo music, give this a try, because they are probaly the most over-rated band out there."
1,A bunch of no good sell outs,"i was once a GC fan. i loved their first cd, they were real and their music reflected the way they dressed and acted. when their 2nd cd came out i couldnt believe what i was hearing and seeing. it was like a compeatly diferent band. a bunch of makeup and ""punk"" clothes. what the hell happend to these guys? o wait i know, it was the money. GC didnt care about making good music anymore, they only cared about what they looked like for all of their ""hardcore"" fans on TRL. Their 2nd album was compleate trash and this one isnt far from it. both albums and the band them selves should be thrown in the garbage"
1,Better things to waste your money on,well.. Good Charlotte..This cd is horrible don't waste your money on buying it..there are muc better things to waste your money on like1)a box of Capri Sun2)new headphones3)a good cd -Catch 22 Keasbey Nightsi bought this cd and it has been collecting dust in my cd rack. i think ill sell it for some money. plus its taking up room.
1,Boys Who Like Dirty Underwear,This is strongly among the worst music around today. It doesn't get much worse than this in a genre that isn't rap. Good Charlotte is a horrendous name and is clearly the work of a bunch of fags who have caca bum on their lips and think they're cool when they jiggle their hips. They are the crust that come off my cat's undergarments everyday.
2,I like one song...,"Good Charlotte's music has been like a splinter in the brain...and although most of their songs make me want to slit my wrists and die...""The world is black"" actually made me want to check out their new CD.my friend Kat lent me her copy and the second I put ""The chronicles of life and death"" in my discman on my way to school in the morning...I skipped past the majority of the tracks to ""The world is black"". the rest of the songs on this record suck ass.but I thought it was worth buying for that one song.and yes, after hearing it for the fifth time it lost its novelty and became a splinter in the brain...like everyother Good Charlotte song.(I know this wasnt very helpfull...it was more of a vent than a review)."
1,They don't care,"You can write reviews all day saying that Good Charlotte is not punk and suck and sold out and blah blah blah... Even though all those things are true, they really don't care what you think. They are getting all the money they want. They become apathetic to what music listeners thought long ago. So why don't you reserve review slots for those that will objectively rate the cds value and not waste space trying to prove to the world that you know what punk music is."
1,Good Charlotte Makes Me Laugh,"...Tee heeBuy this CD so your four-year-old daughter or sister can dance to it. Rather, so she can jump up and down like a retard pretending to be a member of Good Charlotte pretending to play guitar. After all, four-year-olds have an uncanny way of appreciating music that lacks depth and lyrical meaning, and which overall sounds cheesy."
1,complete crap,"this what your 15 year old sister listens too, in her old navy gear and her trucker hat. (...). THIS SHOULDNT EVEN GET 1 STAR! But amazon made me. WEAK."
2,wut?,"y do ppl call this punk? they're just a bunch of boys with mohawks and tatoos that show up on MTV, have their crappy mainstream songs played on the radio. any1 hoo lyks punk, at least check out fall out boy or rise against.GOOD CHARLOTTE? PLEASE. THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE JESSE MCARTNEY, BRITNEY SPEARS, ALY AND AJ, OR ANY KIND OF CRAP THAT SHOWS UP ON RADIO DISNEY AND MTV!!!!!!!AND PUNK? THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SCREAMING I JUST WANNA LIVE INTO A PIECE OF METAL 4 CRYING OUT LOUD!! REAL PUNK IS NOT THIS, SIMPLE PLAN, OR ANY KIND OF (...) 4 ALL I CARE."
5,GC rocks out loud,WHAT IS IT WITH YOU ALL!GOOD CHARLOTTE IS A BAND WITH ALOT OF TALENT!I DONT REALLY GIVE A CRAP IF YOU ALL DONT LIKE IT.THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO REALLY LIKE GOOD CHARLOTTE AND LIKE SONGS THAT DO MORE THAN SCREAM A LUNG OUT...WELL THIS CD IS WORTH BUYING.DONT LISTNEN ONLY TO THE HATERS MOST OF THEM NEVER EVEN BOTHERED BUTYING THE CD.And when you get this cd be sure to lisnen to I just wanna live it is a great song and most bands would not have the guts to try something diffrent cause they are afraid of being riduculed.I give them lots of respect for that.Just do me a favor buy this cd for yourself or a friend please just give good charlotte a try.Puh-lease......
1,Bad Charlotte!,This is the kind of artist that destroys real music. They try to seem like rebels but since they are so mainstream they are not really rebels. This is coorporate made junk.
1,This cd SUX!!!!!! I don't give it ONE star!!!!!,"People call this punk? Good Charlotte's only punk cd was their first album, before they got so popular. Their debut album is not to produced, and the songs are better. 'The Yound and the Hopeless' is pop-punk, and is ok, but not as good as their first.This cd, however, is not even a little punk.This is complete poser music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"GC,where r u going???????nowhere??????","Even though it's a good CD,i dont think it's the best they can do.Actually only 8 songs on 14 r good.With this CD, GC prouved me that they're not that good,even if The young and the hopeless was extremly good and that it was a 5-stars album.The cronicles of life & death is the only song in this CD that could be on the other one,the young & the hopeless.I,who is...or was one of Good Charlotte biggest fan,think this CD kind of sucks...hope you'll be better soon GC!!!!"
2,As a Goth i must ask...,"That you stop saying that GOOD CHAROLETTE is goth, the album was sublime to say the least, just beacuse it""dark"" doesnt mean anything, it was okay but not worth 5 stars. i must repeat good charolette is not goth!"
5,Don't listen to pple who say they're not punk.,"Everyone is judging them by punk standards. So WHAT if they're not punk. They got their own genre of music. They're unique. They're not hard rock (though some assumed they were on ""Predictable""), they're not pop, and they are not hiphop(""I just wanna live"" has too many chords and tabs to be hip hop; they put their own sound in it.) You know what? I think you shouldn't go by what pple say about them; if they say they're great or they suck. Just go buy it. It's what YOU think, not by these pple who don't like them cuz they're jealous."
2,buy the greenday album,the only track i really liked was track 1 and it is not even them. buy american idiot instead.
5,Wonderful Album-Amalia B.,"I really liked this album.It has got very good melodies,but cuttie Joel's vocals are very nice,especially at the ballad ''The Truth''.By this review,I tell ''I really love Joel''.He is the best!!!"
1,This sucks,"I could write an encyclopedia on how much i hate them. GC is nothing but a bunch of filthy, disgusting, unholy pigsthat serve no purpose on earth! I will NEVER stop making ""gc sucks"" listrs!The irony is delicious :)"
1,Trl music for rich white depress kids...,"Good charlotte plays music for young white rich teen ager little depressing teeny popers and i can't stand it. I actullie hear diz horrible cds in the wall in every cd store i go coz i kno i ain gone like diz crap at all.Anyways, The whole album is lame and the lirycs are whiny and dumb very, very dumb. Good charlotte's "" the chronicles of life & death (life art version)"" basically makes me be happy that i dont listing to pop-rock in the first place or hard-rock or heavymetal coz its all stupid and it was made for dumb white people to enjoy. Peace wiggers!"
1,What the????,"Is this actually the same band?!I love the first 2 CDs, and was looking forward to this one. I am SO glad that I borrowed my friend's before I wasted my money on this piece of garbage."

1,"My conversation with Godd Charlotte's frontman, Joel Madden.","Me:Hey Joel, I got you good newsJoel:You bought my album thinking I'm Punk and thus I can become more rich?Me:No. But I just saved $100 in my car insurance by switching to Geico."
1,Talentless hacks.,"Thats all that needs to be said. These guys are a joke. Their lyrics suck. They can't play guitar or bass for s**t, and the drummer (who isn't even a ""real"" memeber) is only average on his best day. I'm not saying that you shouldn't like these guys or that they shouldn't record an album (my dog could get studio time if she wanted to), but do yourself a favor and learn to play guitar or take a creative writing class. Maybe then you'll see just how much talent this band doesn't have."
1,why oh why??,"I really don't understand what has happened to Good Charlotte. I mean i bought the Young and Hopeless and liked it at the time but was told to buy the self titled first album. The first album really rocks and is much more stirring. Now when i listen to TYAH i just cringe! Any one who hates good charlotte because of the last 2 albums, i would say give the first one a go, if u still don't like it fair enough but i really would give it a go.If you are a fan of predictable then you will like this album but for me the only good song on it is ""falling away"" and that is nowhere near the standard of songs from the first album.Even the young and hopeless is better then this album, at least they were still vaguely similar to the first album.What really convinced me was seeing predictable played on music channels, this is not the good charlotte we know and love!!!hope i have helped."
5,Good Charlotte Is Good,i havent bought the life version yet but i'm going to. i bought the death version and that so rocks out loud!! the last song is the only difference between the two albums. for you die hard GC fans i suggest getting both albums just for the last song. i also suggest getting one of them at walmart because they give you a free music download of GC for buying the album.Thanks for reading.By the way i am not a kid i just cant seem to remember my password.
1,Absolute rip offs,They blatantly ripped off MUSE and fall flat on their face. This is ridiculous. They are out of their league... go back to singing about your horrible day at school. I dont care if they have publicly declared their admiration for Muse... its no excuse to copy them. MTV is a brothel and this stuff fits well in their grand scheme.
1,GC has turned into a gothic boyband!,"This album sounds like like Nsync, The Dead Kennedeys, and Marilyn Manson all got together and actually tried to play together... with a special guest apearance by 50 Cent. Chronicles sucks. I miss songs like the Click, Festival Song, and the Anthem. Get GC's first CD instead of this. If you already have it then get Before Everything and After by MxPx!"
2,GET REAL!!,"This is a big dissapointment from GC. This whole album is pretty much a fake cry for help, trying to make GC fans think that they're miserable. ""I Just Want to Live"", ""Predictable"", and ""Believe"" are the cheesiest songs I've ever heard. They should have applied themselves instead of having false breakdowns saying, ""Oh, God, feel sorry for me!"" GET REAL!!"
2,"""Something isn't right...""","Ok. First off, I'm not some kind of hard core punk who thinks every band is some kind of sell out or poser. Along with that I'm not a little fan girl who falls in love with a band just because they're are ""so friggin hott!"" Personally I don't like Good Charlotte. I can't really stand them. Although, the band does have a few catchy songs overall. Some parts are akward for me, listening to the talking/screaming part of ""Predictable"". I must say that was pretty gay. I listened to my friend's copy and tracks 11 was alright. The Chronicles of Life & Death is supposed to be their 'growing up' album but I don't think I buy it just yet."
1,Falling Short,I thought this cd would further expound on the Young and the Hopeless which I thought was an excellent cd. This CD however falls well short of expectations. Some of the songs make me question when they dumped the band and hired a syntehizer. Its just plain disappointing.
2,It's so Predictable.,"This is a very weak effort, it has a RAP SONG, pure rap, I mean you'd think they couldnt sell out anymore but I guess they did. The best song is ""Predictable,"" and thats sad. the rest of the songs are much less catchy, the song ""Wounded"" is a decent slow song tho, but besides that.. and whats up with that Harry Potter intro!?! it goes about 2:42 minutes to long."
1,LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS!!!!!!,"Yeah, I realize that that song isnt on this album. But I just find it hilarious that they would write a song about famous people ""pissing and moaning"" and then turn around and make a song like ""Predictable"", where Joel sings/yells prepubescently about pathetic high school drama. I know most of you mall punks who are over weight 8th graders who wear star wrists bands are scared of singers who have actually hit puberty, so Im not going to bother recommending another band or album because having an intelligent conversation with a Good Charlotte fan is damn near impossible. Open your eyes; they want your money!"
1,if i could give this -100 stars i would,"this is a horible excuse for music..what the fk? a bunch of rich guys from dc with baggy clothes and eyeliner bitching about how poor they are even though they are probably millionares now and grew up in an upper-middle class household and singing songs about the rich and famous..how hypocritical..they were bassicly insulting themselves in that song...they arent ""cool"" they arent ""different"" they surely are not ""tough"" they didnt grow up on the ""streets"" and nobody thinks you are cool when you go to hot topic, buy out everything in the store andthen claim to be poor it just makes you look like a shallow fag so if you listen to this get a life"
3,Great songs....but the words to the songs are off!,"The words are really off on the lyric sheet. It doesn't tell you how many beats to come in on a song and if you were unfamiliar with the song you would totally be lost. The background singers come in at strange times. It would've been nice if the words showed up on the screen of a dvd player. Also, the names of the artist is not listed on the lyric sheet."
2,Need Sculpting Stick,"I love The Firm! I own lots of The Firm videos and use them nearly everyday. This one is my least favorite. I don't have the Sculpting Stick & am not interested in purchasing it. I have The Fanny Lifter, The Firm Box, and my weights. In my opinion, the Sculpting Stick kind of seems like an additional piece of equipment you have to buy that you really shouldn't need in order to get a good workout.I found myself tripping up a lot with this video."
2,One of my least favorite Firm videos,"I own alot of Firm tapes and do Firm workouts about 5 times a week. I got this video 4 years ago. I hardly ever use it because I do not care for it at all. First, it is way too easy for even an intermediate exerciser. Your heartrate does not get up there much at all. Plus, the choreography is lame! I like Nancy but the other instructors behind her are not motivating by any means. I love the Firm, but not this video!"
3,Too Easy,"This is one of the easiest The Firm videos I've seen. It's tough to even work up a sweat unless you add your own steps in-between the choreography. It's very slow. I wear a heart rate monitor when I work out and with most interval workouts (including The Firm) I'm at 150-170. With this workout, I'm barely at 138. I only use this one when I've really pushed myself that week and want something easy. This would be a good pick for someone wondering about The Firm. Easy introduction."
3,may burn calories... but...,"While I love THE FIRM's workouts, this was not one of my favorites so far. Calorie Killer was not simple to follow; and I have little trouble following aerobic/step routines.While the floor aerobic sections definitely get your heart rate up, I find the ease of transitions of movements, for maximum effect to be somewhat lacking. Some people may enjoy this video, but some of the moves were cumbersome and uncomfortable in their given patterns.You also need their fanny lifter and stick for this routine as well.The bonus is that you get a 30 minute quick calorie burner if you're in a hurry."
3,Simple shampoo...not miracle worker,"I have thin hair...I need some boost and this did nothing but mentally satisfy me. If you're going bald like me...you're going bald. No getting around it. I do use the American Crew Boost Cream and that however does a decent job. Boost cream YES, Thickening Shampoo NO."
1,Only english subtitles,DONT GET THIS MOVIE UNLESS U KNOW JAPANESE OR LIKE ENGLISH SUBTITLES. They dont tell u that u cant switch 2 english unlike the first 1 vampire effect can
4,Glenn Hughes Rocks!,"This is one of the finest recordings of Glenn Hughes' career. He's surrounded by some of the 80's best guitarists on this one. Standouts include ""I'm The Man"" with John Norum, (Europe/Don Dokken) ""What Can I Do For Ya"" with Richie Kotzen, ""You Don't Have To Save Me"" with Mark Kendall (Great White) & Warren DeMartini, (Ratt) and all the songs with Darren Householder & Craig Erickson. Erickson also plays all rhythm guitars. Top all that killer playing off with one of the best voices in rock, not to mention most other forms of music, and you've got a near perfect recording. Sorry Crue fans, but Mick Mars was NOT a good fit."
4,This boy can sing the blues!,"One of my all-time favorites, Glenn Hughes has such a great voice. On this album, Glenn really uses it and stretches it to the limit. Great backup musicians and THE VOICE should put this one into your collection."
3,Slightly overrated but still welcome comeback album,"""Blues"" is Glenn Hughes' early '90s comeback bid, after several years of being by and large out of the public eye. It seems that during the whole grunge period it was hard for one of the world's pre-eminent soulful hard rock singers to find his niche, so he released this album of him doing blues-type tunes backed by a slew of LA guitarists (Mick Mars, Mark Kendall, Warren deMartini, etc.) The result is a mostly fun album, although some of the songwriting is somewhat derivative (shades of Stevie Ray Vaughn can definitely be heard in places). Of course, Glenn's voice is as strong as ever. It's a pity he didn't play more bass on it. I do not mean to knock the album, 3 1/2 stars is more on the mark, but as the '90s went on his albums became more daring (especially Addiction), and he is obviously a source of pride for Brummies everywhere."

2,Very Brief Nudity,"You get a couple quick glimpses of topless nudity every once in a while. Theres a good strip routine near the end, but its so dark that you dont see much when she finally takes off her top. you get a few glimpses, you will find more skin flicks than this."
3,"Good, not Classic Beatnuts","1999 - 2000 had a strong rising from the underground groups. Mos Def had Ms Fat Booty, Cocoa Brovaz had Super Brooklyn, Pharoahe Monch had Simon Says, MOP had Ante Up (Robbin Hoodz Theory) Common had The Light, Gangstarr Full Clip, Reflection Eternal The Blast. Well, The Beatnuts had Watch Out Now. When I heard that, and saw the line up of guests on the album, Common, Dead Prez, Greg Nice, remember from the Nice and Smooth Days? I thought this was going to be another classic. Even though I was wrong, this album is still solid. A few week moments, but this is better than any of the crunk garbage that's out there, or at that time, the jiggy garbage. For classic Beatnuts, get Stone Crazy and Street Level. Both are hip hop at it's best. But I say, this is an album still worth your money. By the way, don't listen to any reviewer who tells you that Mase is a good artist. Mase makes Vanilla Ice look like Mos Def."
4,Great-One of the Top 10 Latin Rap CD's,"along with Psych Realm, Cypress Hill, and Delinquent habits, they are the top latino rap groups right now, this CD is excellant, and still brings back good & bad memories of 99, ha,peace..."
3,"Good, Not Great.","This album is pretty good, but not great. A lot of the songs are easy to listen to several times. There are a lot of good beats on the CD but don't go into it expecting unbelievable ones (as I did) or you may be disappointed. ""Watch Out Now"" is probably the best song. The most unfortunate part of the CD is that ""Turn It Out"" is a song where an incredible beat is ruined by repetitive and uninspired lyrics (how many times can you hear them say ""C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, just turn it out"" before you get sick of it?). You could make worse purchases though, and it definitely has a few songs that I listen to a lot. If you need some music and can't find anything else good, go for it."
3,Decent showing by the Corona-Queens demons,"This is an alright outing for the Beatnuts. Since this is the first Beatnuts material I've really listened to, I can't compare it to their first couple albums (which I can't find anywhere!), but it works pretty well. There aren't very memorable tracks on the disc. However, the ones that ARE memorable are truly standouts. The first single from the album, ""Watch Out Now,"" has a terribly infectious flute loop, and the fast-paced beat keeps it moving along nicely. Also, ""Se Acabo,"" the final song on the album, evokes a true Boricua/NY atmosphere. The only thing that would have made the joint hotter is if they'd put on the remix that features Method Man... that was hot! Overall, the album features some okay beats under some okay rhymes. Nothing fantastic, but a good showing, nonetheless."
5,MST3K = laughter,"I have all the boxed sets. While top-notch, as always, it is not as excellent as some of the other sets. Kitten With a Whip is perhaps one of the weaker ones put out. The crew does what it can - but even Mike Nelson, in his intro to it, stated that it was a hard one to do. Shout Factory has done another outstanding job of the artwork and extras. I look forward to XXVI."
5,"Great collection of episodes, as usual!","The collection here is great, especially Operation Double 007 (I refuse to use the ""new"" title). A good mix of Joel and Mike, and of the show at different stages of its evolution. Wonderful stuff for MST fans."
1,Do Not Buy If You Intend To Resell...,I just learned that this item is RESTRICTED which means if you buy a copy you cannot sell it on Amazon. Only certain pre approved sellers may list this item.I was extremely disappointing to learn this as I have been buying and selling things on Amazon for a long time.Looks like I will have to purchase and sell elsewhere.
4,Dias de Blues - Blues Band of Uruguay,"The best uruguayan Blues Band of the 70's. ""Dias de Blues"" ( Days of Blues)was integrated by Daniel Bertolone * Guitar,Jorge Barral * Bass and Jorge Graff in Drums.This LP edition was recorded in Bs. As. 1972 like a testament of the shortly, but good history of this band.No doubt,Dias de Blues is a reference of the uruguayan rock culture,with heavy sound and lyrics in spanish,sometimes so real that thirty years late, the reality of the Uruguay are in the same situation."" Esto es nuestro "" is an example of that.Dias de Blues share the same history room of another big band like Psiglo,Totem,Delfines and more.Themes of this Album:Están desubicados - Amasijando los blues - Esto es nuestro - No podrán conmigo - Toda tu vida"
3,Hardly appealing,"Ricky has long been revered as some sort of closet god, and with this release, its obvious why. 'Shake your bon bon' with its' nonsensical lyrics, yet amusingly catcy chorus, has since become standard fare on the dance floor and in gay clubs throughout the country. However, to put this song on a Maxi-Cd in hopes that people would want to rush out and grab it, is illogical.Martin's song is fun, yes, and more fun if you watch it along with the video, but as a pop single its just far too noisy and messed up to merit repeat listening. I felt the same with 'Vida Loca', which, all said and done, was a better song. Martin fans should have learnt that buying the Ricky album is quite enough. Wasting your money on his single releases is not at all worth it, especially if the song is as tacky and cheesy as this one. Miss this."
4,Even A Non-Ricky Fan Will Enjoy this Maxi-Single,"One could go broke trying to buy all of Ricky Martin's cd-singles and import singles, but it is always worth the purchase. Sometimes, the extended house remix of Ricky's songs will get you out your sit faster than the original, and that is the case with the ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"" maxi-single. The club mix by Fernando Garibay pulsates with hot Latin beats and funky house bass. This version, track 3 on the disc, sexually charges the the otherwise hokey chorus and will have the steadiest bon-bons grooving.The price of admission has to be the heart-wrenching ""Almost A Love Song,"" which is the English version of the ballad ""Casi Un Bolero"" (found on Martin's Grammy-winning CD ""Vuelve""). This hauntingly beautiful love song (rather lack of love) shames all critics who said that Martin could not emote on an English-language ballad. Nothing was lost in translation in this remake."
2,Hook & Loop pad fails; expensive to replace,"I've had my BO5010 for three years, and it hasn't seen a lot of work -- just handyman stuff every few months. Until now, it has been pretty useful, though the dust collection bag is poorly designed.Yesterday in the middle of a job the sanding disc kept flying off. The rubber sanding pad on the base provides the hooks for the hook-and-loop system, and that pad somehow lost its hookiness. No new pad will stick to it.I don't know what caused this: I was using a light touch, and my sanding disc storage organizer uses pegs to ensure the disc's holes line up with those in the pad. Whatever the cause, I now have to order a replacement pad which is nearly one-third the cost of a new sander and may take a week or more for delivery. I'm not sure whether I'd be throwing good money after bad -- I might be better off buying a brand new sander by a different manufacturer.You might, too."
1,disc does not stick. Keeps flying off.,"This sander will not work for a 2 day project. We were sanding the walls in one room and half way through the job, the sanding disc kept flying off. Not sure how to fix this issue and will probably end up buying a new sander to finish the job! It SUCKS!"
4,Million Dollar Shot,"The Million Dollar Shot was a very good book. Dan Gutman is the author of this book, and he did a very good job. He made this book very exciting and intense.If you like any sport, this would be a good book for you. Someone wins a contest to take a shot at a basketball game to win a million dollars. The author gives you every detail to give you a good picture in your mind. I recommend this book to people who play, or are interested in sports."
3,jakes review,"I liked this book because it was a book were the main character told the story, and I don't read many books like that. I also liked it because you never knew what was going to happen.The Million Dollar Shot is about a kid named Eddie. Eddie has a chance to take a foul shot in the NBA finals. If he makes the shot he will become a millionaire. His mom will also get her job back.The type of reader that would like this book would be someone who likes suspense because you never know how it is going to end up."
4,Great Book,A kid gets into a foul ball shot contest.He has 1 chance to make it and win 1 million $$$
4,The Million Dollar Shot,"The Million Dollar Shot is about a boy named Eddie. He lives with his mom in a poor trailer park, but one day Eddie sends a poem into a contest hoping to win. One day he gets selected to shoot for 1 million dollars in New York City. He did shoot it and he got 1 million dollars! The ending is very good, but I won't tell you what it was... you'll have to find out yourself. This book is quite funny and entertaining. This book would've gotten 5 stars but it wasn't very long, if it was longer it would've been a spectacular book! No matter what, this book has got to be read!!"
3,Million Dollar Shot Review,"The Million Dollar Shot by Dan Gutman is a charming story about friendship, integrity, and hard work. The book is obviously written with the knowledge that kids will be its main readers. The language is intelligent, yet not so difficult that young people will not be able to understand it.The relationship between the main characters is developed nicely throughout the story. As a reader, I was able to visualize Eddie, Annie, and the trailor park in which they reside thanks to the descriptive language used by the author.The Million Dollar Shot is wonderful for a class or library read aloud. The chapters are short and concise, and the plot moves along at a nice pace. Kids will stay interested, and they will want to know what happens next. As soon as you finish one chapter, they will ask you to read another."
1,not very interesting,The book The Million Dollar Shot was about Eddie shooting a foul shot for a million dollars. I think the book was ok because it was interesting and boring a lot. It didn't have enough action in it. I wish the author made story more interesting or made It about skatebording. I would reccommend this book to no body.
4,"Good Book, Very Interesting!",Eddie Ball has to make this shot in front of a lot of fans.I would feel very nervous trying to make the shot. Is he going to make it? You'll have to read the book to find out!!!reader from Wisconsin
3,MILLION DOLLAR SHOT,"The book Million Dollar Shot is ok. The reason i sorta like my book is because i like basketball. I would recommend this type of a book to a person who likes basketball. I would say this is a three star book. The reason its a three star book is because it doesn't entertain you in any way, and it doesn't get you in suspense about it or anything. This book is about a boy who likes to play basketball, but can only shoot if nobody else is around. He has a chance to win 1000000 dollars in the NBA finals.by: Andrew"
5,Powerful Malian melody and rhythm,"This is really an amazing cd. High quality, and Djelimadi's guitar is mind blowing--Like a clean jimi hendrix with delay pedal. Highly recommended. I think th other reviewer below mistakenly put 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 if you read the review."
5,great quality,"The shipment arrived much quicker than expected. All the tools are made of great quality. The rolling matt is large and can be rolled and stored away, stays on the surface, and has circles and dimensions printed on it, which is very difficult to find. The rolling pin is heavy and easy to move around. The serving knife is large enough. The pastry blender is sturdy enough to blend butter in flour. Besides the colors, pink and silver, are very pretty! the addition of all is worth the price."
1,BAD BATTERY,"Battery failed to hold a charge. When charged and attached to my camera light, battery went off after about ten minutes. It would work for a few seconds and then go off."
1,HOW MANY MORE MONTHS?,PRODUCT WAS ORDERED AUG. 16 2012 TODAY IS SEPT. 17 2012 AND STILL HAVENT RECEIEVED NOTHING. I WONDER HOW MANY MORE MONTHS TIL IT GETS HERE.MAYBE THEY SHIPPED IT ON A DONKEY.
5,Used for LED lights,"I used this for the NEEWER 160 Dimmable Led lights, and got the travel charger for it separately. Worked well."
2,Worked for several months,"The batteries worked for several months as backups to my canon battery. They were left in between projects for several months, now they will barely hold a charge. Use at your own discretion."
5,Very good price. Very good quality.,My two year old Panasonic digital camera crapped out a few weeks ago and since they are not repairable (they will only do a exchange for 75% the new cost!). I dragged out my old Sony. It still takes great macro pictures for my eBay sales but the battery would no longer hold a charge. It is also built like a TANK so I hope it will be around for a while longer.These are not factory batteries but are cheap and seem to be working great. Fast shipping and no problem transaction.
1,total loss,"this battery will not take a charge.it is a total loss at any price, it will end up it the trash"
1,Battery for Neewer light bar,This battery was recommended for a Neewar digital light bar. It does not fit and does not have the correct electrical contacts. Very disappointed.
1,NOT COMPATABLE WITH NEEWER CN-160 VIDEO LIGHT,"THIS BATTERY DOES NOT FIT INTO THE BATTERY CRADLE FOR THE NEEWER CN-160 VIDEO LIGHT. THE BATTERY CRADLE IS STAMPED WITH ""FOR PANASONIC D16""."
5,Very Strong,I use this battery on my portable LED light attachment for my iPhone. I found this battery to last a long time. In fact it lasted over 2 hours when making a video outside. It's a perfect replacement battery and worth the cost.
1,APALLINGLY AMATURISH,"I wish I could give this novel zero stars instead of the manditory minimum one. It's so extraordinarily devoid of any literate talent or merit. The characters are poorly drawn cartoons. The author doesn't have a clue what dramatic structure is or how to develop a plot. Simply incredible. I'm not that demanding when it comes to literature, but this absolute mess of a book is the worst I've ever comes across. Who on earth published it?"
1,not yet shipped,"i ordered over 2 weeks ago and my order still hasn't shipped, its sad the thing i ordered first hasn't shipped and everything else already arrived."
1,Work light,"I purchased this work light expecting to use it with my M18 batteries, but I must not have read the small print because it will not work with the M18 batteries."
3,No spare bulb,"I already have one of these at home and they are handy to have around,so I thought I would buy another and use the spare bulb in the one I own already( A spare bulb is stored under lens cap). At a price of 9.99 it seemed more convenient than buying replacement bulbs at a comparable price. Guess what, no spare bulb came with the flashlight shipped from RFB direct. Confused on why they would remove the spare bulb but not so surprised(I brought from them before).No doubt if and when you buy the replacement bulbs from RFB it will come without the proper packaging (clue, these would be the one removed from our flashlights) . Will now have to go out and buy some bulbs now."
5,Nice Light,"This light is a great addition to my Milwakee drill, it is extreemly bright and I use it all the time with projects. I recommend adding this accessory to your drill kit."
5,great help,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head, amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house, also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
3,The only problem I see is bulb,"The only real problem with this light is caused by bulb failure, then when you go to buy one you find out that the price range is from 4 dollars to 7 dollars a bulb if you can find them. I would recommend that something be done to beef these types of bulbs up and that customer know that this is what they are going to run into when they buy this type of light ."
4,worth the money,"I love this thing. Very bright. Pivoting head is better than the dewalt version. Will shine all day with a fresh battery. Only fault....NO Belt clip. The clip should come with it, as a gift, for choosing milwaukee over dewalt. Other than that it's a great buy."
3,I will like it L E D,"I'm a milwaukee fan, I like it, but i will like to see more accesible prices in the L E D. line"
2,The Snow Joe doesn't like certain types of snow...Most types...,"The Snow Joe 12-Inch 6.6 Amp Electric Snow Thrower #322 is only good in 4in of light, powdery snow. This thing is darn near useless. Even if there isn't a lot of snow and you're trying to clear a path in a small driveway or on the side walk, if the snow is too heavy, the Snow Joe barely budges or it doesn't dig deep. You have to go over the snow with several passes to even see the ground and I'm talking about only a few inches of snow. I had to eventually put this product aside and start using my shovel again. I don't like having to reshovel what this product is supposed to be plowing through. Yeah, it makes a lot of noise but that's about all it does.I purchased the Snow Joe because I thought it would be a time and back saver but it turned out to be clumsy and ineffective."
4,SnowJoe Goes,"I had a similar product (Toro Power Shovel), but the SnowJoe is an improvement. It has a longer,curved handle which makes it easier to use. It handles 4-5 inches of light snow easily, and deeper snow if you make several passes while lifting the thrower. The only drawback was assembly. Getting the cord properly placed inside of the housing was a little difficult and I am pretty handy at that sort of thing."
2,Broken blade after 2nd use,"I noticed after the second used that one of the blades is already broke. (about a 2"" piece is missing from one of the blades. That's what you get for something that spins at high speeds and is made from plastic.Can I get a replacement blade????"
1,Not as GOOD as they say it is!,I recvd this the other day & used it today after the NYC snow storm! I had to keep bushing it too many times to get it to blow any snow! The blue plastic blade even broke on this 1st day!SUCKS!!!!Now I have to try to get another blade after using it for 1 day!I guess you get what you pay for!I would not recommend this to any one!
3,snow joe,This product is fairly good to use just after the snow is over and is about 2-3 inches accumulation.
5,great!,I bought this for my mom who is disabled and it is a blessing! She is able to handle it with ease and she says it works great. Thank you!
4,Small Jobs only not big jobs,"I recieved Mr. snowjoe as a gift for xmas and finally this weekend we got enough snow in NY to try out the little guy. Unfortunately there was too much snow for the machine to actually work. But as mentioned in previous reviews, works GREAT on stairs, patios and walk-ways. Its small and not heavy so you can easily put it away and carry the item.Over-all: Good item."
2,Works...but for what purpose?,"Several people really seem to like this product, so I guess there's a niche somewhere. I understood when I bought it that it wasn't going to replace a $400 snow blower, but I was disappointed in how little it can actually handle. It can handle about 4 inches of POWDERY snow. Once the snow settles and hardens a little, this device gets overwhelmed.If you have a serious back condition, I guess this might make sense, since you don't have to do the shoveling motion. But it is VERY limited in what it can handle. I didn't attempt to return it because it does function and the shipping would be prohibitive...but I regretted this purchase after its first use."
2,Buy a Shovel,"Simply stated: Buy a good shovel.Unwieldy, electric cord hassle, takes more physical effort than simply shoveling.Will return for credit."
2,Too small too heavey,"I would say the product is good for small walk ways and light snows. But for larger areas or snows over 5 inches, it does not do the job. Also for older people and very young because it has no wheels holding it becomes quite heavy."
4,Portable and Awesome,"We've had a strange winter here in Alaska this year from record snowfalls in a day or the month or record warm temperatures in the same month. This has left us with a mess of snow and in a lot of cases, hardened snow. I've definitely put the Snow Joe to the test this past month. It has cleared at least 4-6 in of snow several times, wet and dry snow and also hardened snow and it has done an amazing job. It's also very lightweight, so light in fact that my 5 year old used it on the stairs to help me out. He loved it. The only reason why I am not rating it as a 5 star is because of the blower location. It only shoots forward and when we got 16in overnight, I tried using it on the walkway and with it's design, it had a harder time. If the chute was set up just a little different, I think that it would be perfect. Totally worth the price."
2,Buy spare blades,A chunck of ice the size of an ice cube shattered the blade ... buy spare blades at $20.00 each ... If You Can Find Them !!!
3,Does what it says it does,"I bought the Snow Joe after a third heavy snow storm hit the northeast last winter. Overall, it is does what is advertised, but in practice that's not very helpful. In snow that's about 6- 8 inches deep, it will throw about 10 feet ahead. And it works best with dry snow. The thing is, a shovel will clear that kind of snow about as easily. It would make a big difference if the snow was thrown to the side, but that would require a much different, and probably more expensive, design. So, if you want a snow thrower that will launch 6 - 8 inches of dry snow about 10 feet in front of you, that's what this advertises it will do. But after a few uses, I'm not sure that's too useful."
5,Does what it says: Easy on your back,"I'm a 65 year old 5'3"" woman and I hate having to lift a shovel full of heavy snow. The snow joe works well and I just have to push and lift it. It's true it only snowed once since I've had it and I was afraid I'd put it together wrong, but once I pushed that plug in, it worked like a dream. I use it with a 100' cord and of course it's a little akward but it works a whole lot better than a shovel. I got a Wonder Winder with it and that works very well with it. I highly reccommend all of the above."
4,Works great and minor issue,"As some of you remember, we had quite a snow storm on march 18th weekend.this machine save me time and energy.( I had 2 houses to clean mine and parents)A fine machine. all my neighbors envy me. works great.There is a slotted screw and Countersunk Nut to hold together between top handle from bottom unit. both machines (I bought 2 for me and my folks)lost this part(missing in action). Lost and buried in snow...I email company for replacement part.otherwise. a fine machine..... works great. save lots of time and energy"
4,Sure beats shoveling the old way!!,"February of 2010 has been a challenge for those of us in the northeast. The Snow Joe Plus isn't a miracle machine, but if you take your time, and control it so you don't take more than a 4"" deep bite at a time, it can move some serious snow. The only downside is it only throws it straight ahead, so be careful if you're working towards your house, or any windows. Your arms and shoulders will also have to get used to bearing its weight, which is considerably less than a shovel full of wet snow.All in all, its fun to operate, helps to save your back, and performs exactly as advertised."
4,Even in Slush/Snow Mix is works!,"Last night 3 inchs of snow hit here with mix of rain. So the snow was mostly packed down with slush. But I was able to clear the entire area. I also did the driveway and its not short one. So far so good all the snow and slush was shot out in front of my path I almost hit some cars and truck driving by whoops!This is amazing for less than $90 bucks there is something to save my lower back and I was able to clear a path for people to walk on my sidewalk with less effort. I live on a busy street, but I know those who had seem me was surprise to wee that this little device works!I know I need to get the SnowJoe 622, but I wanted to get the 322 as it has been around longer and has been tested heavy. It has paid off. Using this item felt like I was pushing a vaccum forward but instead of picking stuff out it shoots it out."
1,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!,"THIS MORNING I USED MY SNOW JOE PLUS FOR THE THIRD TIME AND IT BROKE. HIT A SMALL ROCK AND IT BROKE OFF A PIECE OF BLADE. IT WORKED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE THEN STOPPED ALL TOGETHER. YOU MAY WANT TO USE RUBBER INSTEAD OF PLASTIC! I DON'T THINK I'LL BE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, PERHAPS OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY."
3,Okay for a few inches of dry snow.,"Heavy and difficult to push, only good for a few inches of dry snow. It did throw 4 inches of wet snow but I had to lift it. I might as well use a shovel since I have to lift it up. Easy to assemble."
2,Meh.,"Doesn't move as much as I'd hoped. Also, my driveway and walk aren't completely level, which makes this thing somewhat challenged. Wish it worked better."
2,Good Snow Thrower for the Money,This does the job and was a good price for the buy. The blade however did break after a few uses so I wouldn't recommend it. It was just plastic.
4,it works very well.. blade broke first time..,"the product is good with some issues. its heavier than I thought it would be. in fact, when you hold it, its awkward. the trigger handle is in line with the handle, so when you squeeze it (to turn on the motor), your wrist muscles are out of alignment with your body, and it gets tiring (youll see when you try). its kind of like trying to sweep with a broom and pull the trigger on a gun at the time time.the blade broke the first time I used it. I didn't hit a stone. I ran into some compact snow, and it broke. it still spins, but I need to get a new one eventually.for 4"" of snow, its great. but if you let it pile up, and you have to lift it off the ground, it gets heavy fast, even for big guys.all together, I recommend it. the blade replacements are $19. not bad. cheaper than the toro. I wish I could explain better how the design of the trigger is awful."
4,Actually usefull,"Odly enough,I actually used some of the strange things in this book for my wedding. So,it was not only humerious in a very stressful time,but surprisingly useful, too."
4,Makes Excellent gift for the Harley Lover!,We gave this as a gift to a Harley fanatic. He loved it! Explained how Harley came to be. Very entertaining!
3,Es para personas mayores,"Se lo recomiendo a mi papa o a mi abuelo, no es para alguien menor de 35 anos, no te hace sentir sexy si no mas bien algo elegante."
1,Not a good seller.,"My bottle never arrived and the seller never compensated me for that, Amazon did though. I did reorder the cologne by another seller and it is very nice, but this seller did not want to help after receiving the payment. I think however it was a handeling problem or maybe someone took it from my front steps, any case the package was not to be left on the steps, don't know who said it if it was supposed to be left on the steps, but the seller did not want to help find out what went wrong with one of there customers. and thats not good......So i'm happy with this same product that I got from a different seller but unhappy with what happened in the deal with this seller. They did give me a 10% discount card on my next purchase which is like a band aid for a gunshot wound......you guys are real funny at Mont Blanc. Step up your customer service because the product is very nice."
2,is this a sample?,"I think ""Montblanc Presence by Montblanc for Men 0.17 oz"" is a sample, because the outside printed ""FREE SAMPLE/ NOT FOR SALE""...So, is it legal that you guys sell the samples on line?"
1,Montblanc Presence,This bottle that i purchased only smells good when you spray it that's all. It doesn't last longer than that. That split second that you spray it that's all. That's how long the smell last. It's really discouraging cuz I really love this perfume. I've had it many times before. But this purchase was the worst. I guess I should've gone to Macy's or sephora
5,Presence,"Wonderful scent. I received a gift set of body lotion and Eau De Toilette as a gift a few years ago and have been hooked ever since. I wear it layered everyday and get complements on it all the time. It can be hard to find, I hope you continue to carry it."
5,excellent frangrance,"Fragrance unique and special, women become mad with this fragrance, very sophisticated and elegant for a romantic occasion or casual"
3,A real grower,"My original review only gave 3 stars. Thing is, I've listened to this several times since and it is a real grower. I guess i was judging it using his debut and 'High gear' as yardsticks. Ironically, there's a lot more subtlety, feel and depth on 'Introspection' than on those 2 albums. Some posters here has alluded to it as jazz fusion. No, it's got far more of a blues feel, except that it's taken blues to stratospheric levels that orginal bluesmen couldn't have dreamed of. Like Satch and unlike most other 'shredders', Greg Howe comes up with strong melodies as well as lightning fast light fingered fretwork. I haven't heard a better player in any genre since discovering 'Surfing with the alien' back in 1988."
4,Introspection for the Soul,"When Greg Howe first arrived in the mid 80's with his debt release ""Greg Howe"", the music community knew there was a new talent not to be denined. Grown tired of the ""Foo-Foo"" hair rock of his early day, Greg exploded on to the fusion/jazz-rock scene with this fire breathing, passion filled, harmonic wonder of a guitar album. Greg more than proves for legions of guitar critics that speed, flair, and grooving melody can be best friends within a song."
3,he's done better,"There is definetly some catchy stuff on this CD (and, of course, many mind blowing solos), but I like some of his other albums much better (his debut album, Uncertain Terms and Parallax)."
2,Beware...This is NOT the complete book!,"This book is only Volume 2 of 2 parts of the whole book! The book starts out with ""Part Two: Slow and Low Smoke-Scented Salads, Pastas, and Pizzas (Continued)"" and at step #6 of the recipe. The description of this book does not show this information anywhere. I would not have ordered it if I had known it was only half the book. I will be returning it. I have now ordered the original REAL book to be sent to my brother as a late Christmas gift."
3,Just Average,"I purchased this for a family member who just bought a new smoker. While it has a lot of different receipes, it also has a some strange ones. It's OK, but not great."
3,It's ok but...,"This book is ok but.... All recipes utilizes a specific weight of meat, hard to find that in the market or way to big for family of three even for leftovers."
5,A complete book,"This book was recommended by a friend who caters pig roasts professionally and it is everything he said - full of great recipes. Whether you want ribs or pulled pork, brisket or sides, this cookbook has it all."
5,The source for great rubs,This book will pay for itself with the money you will save in making your own rubs. Wild Willys Wonderful (rib) rub gives results just as good as the best barbeques I've ever tasted.
3,Some interesting recipies,"I bought this book hoping to get some good advice on cooking ribs, etc. What it has are some really interesting recipes. I tried a couple on my family (smoky corn on the cob was one) and was pleasantly surprised. I am looking forward to trying different smoked foods."
4,Good Book,"There are a ton of recipes in this book. Its pretty simple to follow the recipes. I have only tried on recipe, ""Kansas City Sloppy Ribs"" and they came out decent, but I think I just need more practice."
3,"Grilling, Smoking, cooking","Too expenseive for what you get. It is a good recipe book overall, BUT it really doesn't focus on smoking as much as grilling outdoors, and there's a lack of VARIETY even then."
3,"a good smoke recipe book, not so much a how to smoke book","I was disappointed with this only in the fact I thought it would go over actual ways of smoking meats more. It spends a few pages going over different types of smokers and some techniques, but thats it. The book is primarily recipes of rubs and sauces. I'll use the book and its a good book to have just not quite what I was wanting."
4,Smokin' Good Ideas,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is enjoying reading through it and finding recipes to try and ideas to make our existing BBQ better.
4,nice book,I bought this book with the idea of learning new ways to make ribs brisket and pulled pork. They offer quite a few rub and marinade. They have multiple ways to cook different foods. They also offer some elaborate recipes for a formal dinner.
4,Great Book with Great Recipes,This is a great book with great recipes. We bought it because we like to make things from scratch and have more control over our food ingredients. This book is very helpful and useful.
5,"Excellent book, husband loves it.","My husband has recently gotten into smoking and is very detailed when he starts a ""project"". He is really happy with this book. I bought based on the other positive recommendations and I'm glad I did. Getting a copy for both our fathers, too!"
4,Smokin',"Really like this book for grilling and smoking adventures. I already had this book in my collection, so I purchased this for my son's. They both like to grill and smoke all year like me. Great book for the serious griller/smoker."
5,Smoke and spice cookbook,This was an Xmas gift for my husband...who spent many hours reading receipes and drooling! He can't wait to try many of them.
5,"if u smoke,u need this","truly awesome smokers book.I hjave had this for a few years,even got one for my son,as I gave him a smoker also,the makers of this one,also have a book called dadgum thats good,also a great cook book,masterbilt is awesome,their indoor deep turkey fryer has a smaller foot print and is awesome"
5,A little SMOKE Please!,"I bought this book after we purchased a new SMOKER from SMOKIN-IT on the AMAZON SITE. The smoker is electric and was $249 on AMAZON. It is awsomeyou can check it out or look up the name on the internet and read more about the smoker.This book has lots of great recipes for smoking. Things I would have not even thought of. Sausage, Rabbit, Venison, Canadian Bacon, A ham...Lots of stuff. Spice Rubs, Pastes, Marinades.Its great to try different sauces and rubs. The book was shipped fast and I look forward to my next SMOKE. We bought this book on AMAZON.Remember your smoke is only as good as the money you spend on it!"
4,The Next Step for All Kinds of Smoking,"Once you get the hang of smoking this book takes you to the next step. It is chock full of sauces, mops, recipes of all kinds, from the simple to the more exotic. You are not limited to just stovetop smokers - all kinds of fire pits, outdoor stoves, etc are covered. The different woods and recommended foods are explored. There are so many variations to choose from in this 482 page book that you will be in smoker heaven for a long time to come.Not only everything imaginable such as venison, rabbit, sausages, ham, but side dishes are included, such as smoked onion rings, various varieties of potatoes. Included are many regional rib recipes plus chicken, beef, breads and much more."
5,Excellent book that helps with flavor in all cooking,"I love the way this book is organized, it is very easy to understand & very flavorful recipes! Many of the recipes are very good even without using a smoker but they are recipes for use with a smoker which gives the depth and flavor of BBQ that I so love! There are many dishes, foods & combinations of various foods or ingredients that I never thought of using in my smoker! This book gave me a renewed excitement to start cooking some BBQ this year! If you are new to real BBQ cooking another book I highly recommend for learning how to BBQ is a book called ""Low & Slow"" both are excellent books a must for real BBQ enthusiasts!"
4,Good Book!,"Well, there's no fighting it...this is one of the ""must have"" books if you are into ""low and slow"" BBQ...I've tried a few of the recipes and nearly all were fine...I'm relatively new to BBQ (graduating from grilling) but I've done quite a few smokes and I will try more of the recipes...the only two problems I have with the book thus far are their thoughts on letting spareribs or baby backs sit overnight with a rub...this isn't the best idea because the ribs can come out ""hammy""....that's what happened to me with one recipe...two or three hours are all you need...second, I wish they would suggest types of wood to go with the recipes...In summation, one of the best BBQ books out there...it will not meet ALL your needs and some of the techniques are questionable but for the beginner and novice my advice would be to buy it..."
3,OK,I wouldn't rate this as a 'must have'. It doesn't have too many pictures so you have to read about stuff to figure out if it's actually something you want to try or not.Pros:Good stuffObviously comes from prosCons:No pictures
2,Not what I was expecting,"Yes, it's a nice book......but I'm not excessivly thrilled about it. A book 450+ pages and only 7 rib recipes??? PLUS, I GUARANTEE I'm never going to fit a 150 pound hog in my Mastercraft 30"" smoker, AND I highly doubt I'll be smoking pheasant, quail or a goat or making a smoked DUCK PIZZA. I was looking for standard recipes with a lot of variations. Not the exotic."
3,Average,"I own a lot of cookbooks, of which I probably own 10 cookbooks for BBQ. I found this one to be average."
2,Overpriced...nothing new in here!,"So, got my beautiful new Electric Digital Smoker by MasterBuilt..Decided to buy this book.Wow...what a lot of nonsensical recipes that are all over the internet for free.Nothing new or exciting or even inventive contained...simply a rehash of what else is out there for 20 years.So...basically...I feel like a waste of money and I can hardly recommend this to anyone!"
2,Winner of the cheap and ugly book award!,"I got this book as a gift for Christmas. You can't judge a book by it's cover, and that is certainly true here! Open the nice glossy cover with nice picture to find the hardest-to-read print on the cheapest paper they could find.I've said it before. Anyone can print recipes off the internet for free. When you spend your money on a book, you expect more.The book promised lots of instruction on techniques, and ""whys"". I just see lots of recipes. They better be outstanding to overcome the cheapness and ugliness of this book.If you like cheap and ugly, this book is for you!"
4,Smoke & Spice hot item for the smoker of food,"This is a well laid out and easy to understand book. If you are interested in taking the smoking of your meals to a new level, then have this book handy. Well worth the price."
5,Great Resource,"I picked this book up looking for some ideas for new rub and sauce recipes and it hasn't disappointed. There are also some great recipes for sides as well. I've done 2 of the rubs and have liked them both so much that I've made huge portions of each, so I can have some on hand without a ton of work. Got great feedback on both from family and friends. There is also a lot of helpful material in the beginning of the book for people that are new to using a smoker. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys using a smoker and has fun with different spices and sauces."
5,Really nice story,I thought this book was a really good story. I will buy other books by this author. Couldn't stop reading.
1,Disappointed,"I just closed the book at page 30. From reading all the reviews, it sounds like I'll be missing a good book with a great story, but I choose NOT to read a book with so much swearing in it. :( Darn. I was looking forward to this one.I know that's not a very popular thing to say about a book, but just in case anyone happens to be like me out there, I thought I'd comment."
5,A must-read novel by a new author,"CARRY ME HOME did eactly that for this reader, transporting him into another world so close to that of his youth he didn't want to leave once he got there. No author he's read in several decades has succeeded in doing that.But this story is neither about nostalgia nor inducing it. Told in the words of Earwig, a young boy we today would call ""developmentally disabled,"" it is a story of familial love, unquestioning acceptance of one's fellows, and a wisdom held by one few would expect to know the meaning of wisdom.Although stories such as CMH are a challenge to write without waxing maudlin or saccharin, Sandra Kring has proved her ability to treat her subject with sensitivity, perceptiveness, and a grasp of that deepest part of a person, the soul. And she does it beautifully. Her characters will not be forgotten."
3,Carry Me Home,"I liked the premise of the book. At times, some of the characters were overbearing and it took too long to lead the reader to the ending. Too much repetition of information. Wisconsin reader"
5,A Simple Truth,"Carry Me Home by Sandra Kring is a novel that works. In the hand of a lesser writer Earwig, the main character, could have been a caricature of exaggerated simplicity. Kring, however, has created a character to remember..........a kind hearted , simpleminded boy whose take on life is refreshingly honest and wise. The story evokes a nostalgic feel ........elliciting a time when life was both so simple , yet so complex.Through the simple minded Earwig, we learn about the devastation and sacrifice of World War 2. We are part of a sweet coming of age story imbued with serious topics that are seen through Earwig's childlike eyes. We witness the deep love between brothers that leads to Earwig's new sense of responsibility and growth. So many basic tenets of life and the challenges that it creates are heartwarmingly depicted in this novel.This is a book to savor on a summerday or a winter evening. It will make you laugh, cry and think about what is really important."
5,One of the best,I loved this book! I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. This book stays with you for a long time because it is such a real story. I would recomend this book to anyone.
2,a disappointment,"maybe because i read The Book of Bright Ideas first, I was expecting something as good or better. It is not. The book isn't bad but my expectations were not met. I will eagerly await Sandra Kring'd next book and hope it is more in line with the writing of BoBI."
3,not my favorite,"having read sandra kring's 2nd novel ""the book of bright ideas"" before this one, ""carry me home"" was then a let down."
3,Califone childs keyboard,"The keyboard does not have upper and lower case letters on keys.The keyboard also does not use contrasting colors of letters on keys making it difficult for anyone to learn the keys for the first time. For children who are getting use to the keyboard, it would be more helpful to display the letters better."
2,Lovely but Very Poor Quality,"This table is charming, very easy to assemble, however, it it the poorest quality peic3e of furniture I've purchased for any of my three children. Within one week, my two year old daughter accidentally knocked over the very light chair, and the knob broke and another piece chipped off. There are other places on the table where pieces have chipped off. As pretty as the table is, it is very poor quality and I would not recommend purchasing it."
2,terrible saw,this saw is good for nothing except maybe ripping rough framming materialtoo small for ply (easily tipped over)fence useless (very difficult to square with blade)weak motorarbor too shortBUY A BOSCH
2,"CABINET MAKER NO, ROUGH CARPENTRY YES.","THIS SAW IS IN ACCURATE, MITER GAUGE IS USELESS. RIPPING FENSE ASLO INACCURATE BUT NO PORBLEM TO USE FOR FRAMER. IT NEED RECHECK AND READJUST IN ACCURATE.I RECOMMEND MORE ACCURATE SAW. I WILL SELL AND BUY ANOTHER SAW IF POSSIBLE."
2,"Not Precise Enough for Woodworking, Flimsy Fence","I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking. No matter how long I spent adjusting it, I couldn't get the rear of the fence to lock solid, or to lock in the same place every time. VERY frustrating when you're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters, but compared to woodworking, they don't need any kind of precision. For that, a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good. But do spend the money for the upgraded fence. The stock fences on those are garbage too. If you really need a lightweight, compact saw, look at the DeWalt and the Bosch."
3,needs improvements,"purchased this saw about a year ago and found some good and some bad qualities. the fence that comes with it sucks, miter guage sucks, and the stand is also pretty sucky but these are things other reveiwers have already written. The good things are the price, lightweight, and pretty powerfull. The best thing for the saw is the rousso stand which gives you a excellent fence and stand. The only downside is the stand cost $300 and adds another 45 pounds to the saw. I guess what I'm trying to say is in the end I would of been better off with the bosch or the dewalt, and it would have cost me atleast a $100 less."
3,Makita Screws Us Yet Again...,"As a long term owner of the Makita 2708, I was at first overjoyed to hear of their portable 10"" that would drop right into my existing Rousseau stand, and best of all, they replaced the elevation knob with a speedy crank!Then I actually saw one, and much to my dismay it became apparent that Makita wanted to play the same games they played with the 2708 - the Miter slot is slightly under the world-wide 3/4"" standard, which means none of the superb aftermarket saw accessories are usable with this saw. To add insult to injury, the only accessory Makita offers is the standard miter gauge. What a waste!I think it's time to dump my 2708 and go elsewhere...."
1,Table saw flaw,Don't buy this saw. There appears to be a manufacturing defect in the rack plate which allows adjustment of the beveled angle on the saw. Makita needs to rethink their design and use steel instead of plastic for this part. Twice now I have purchased the saw and had to return it because several teeth were missing on this plate making bevel adjustments impossible. This can create a real problem in delays for the professional contractor.
2,faulty bevel lock,"At first I was very happy with this saw, despite the somewhat wobbly fence design. After a couple of months of light use, however, the locking mechanism for the bevel adjustment had stripped, allowing the bevel angle to shift while cutting."
3,"Light, powerful, imprecise, non-standard","Strong saw, and light, and with the Porta Table has a nice fence and will cut very wide. However, the arbor is too short for dado work as large as I'd like and the non-standard miter slots limit the amount of after market stuff you can use with the saw. I'm looking to sell mine and upgrade to a more versatile saw."
5,excellent product,This is my favorite table saw and I use it for everything and have never had any problems. I bought the rousseau table to attach it to and I will never part with it...
5,Top Product,My husband and son both own this table saw. It is a top of the line product. My husband and owned his for at least 10 years and uses it daily. Still in great shape with very low maintance.
2,Non-standard Miter Slot,"Tenon jig, forget it. Featherboard, nope. Accurate miter gage, negative. Any accesories to make this saw do more than ripping, out of the question. Documentation of the non-standard miter slot, non-existent. Don't buy this saw unless you are looking for a plain old plywood cutter. It does that pretty good though.-------------------An update - Still using this saw, still cursing the fence and MITER SLOT. Recently I've found the arbor to be way short for dadoing. Maximum dado width is 3/8"". List price of $550? Are they joking? You can buy a Grizzly cabinet saw for a little more than that. Seriously, all you can do with this saw is basic ripping."
2,Makita needs to update this product,"This saw used to be the end-all in portable table saws. It's still as tough as they come, but Makita has done little to improve it's features in the twenty years I've been working. It is lightweight, but the fence and sliding angle guide are highly inaccurate. If you buy this saw, I recommend purchasing the Rousseau table with it to ensure an accurate fence, outfeed and extension tables. Unfortunately, the cost of both table and saw exceed that of buying a truly good job-site table saw such as the Bosch, DeWalt or Porter Cable. I'm really surprised, too, because Makita offers (in my opinion) the best 10"" sliding compound miter saw on the market. If all you're doing is framing, buy the Makita."
3,Would be great except for flimsy adjustment gearing.,"I have owned 3 Makita table saws and used them very hard in tough construction conditions. Never a problem except the blade adjustment knob gets very hard to turn. With the new 10"" model I was hoping that they fixed this problem and also upgraded the rip fence. It started out good, meeting my high expectations. But after a year of use the bevel gearing (made of plastic) lost a couple af teeth. Shortly after that the height adjustment became stripped. Then the rip fence knob broke! The motor and the housing were great and I especially liked the dust chute. This would be a great saw except for the above."
3,Let down,"This is my first table saw. What I don't like about the Makita is the non-standard mitre slot. It makes no sense. It takes away the ability to upgrade to a decent mitre gauge. The fence seems pretty poor. Luckily for me, I'm a weekend warrior. If I was using this saw all day everyday, I'd upgrade. The only way to make sure the fence is parallel to the blade is to visually line it up. It takes a long time.Besides the fence and mitre slot, I guess I have no complaints. But IMO, those are two pretty big complaints."
4,Good Table-Top Saw,"I am an advanced amateur craftsman and was looking for a table saw to use around the house. I was tired of using a radial saw to make all of my cuts. I am very happy with this Makita saw. It was ready to work after about 20 min of assembly. I cut everything from MDF to four by fours with the saw and it has performed very well. The toughest test was a half-inch wide, one and one half inch deep dado cut on six inches of material at a time. I had to go slow but the saw never missed a beat. The only down side to the saw is that the miter slot is smaller than standard size. I am not sure why Makita decided to depart from the standard but it makes doing complex table saw operations difficult. I recommend this saw to anyone looking for a tough, powerful (for its size), workhorse of a saw. As long as you remember that in is a tabletop saw you will not be disappointed."
1,bad arbor design,"Ive used the old 8 1/2 makita for years, and now owned the 10"" (and the Bosch) for a few years now. I loved the portability (best part) and the fence is god-awful unless you get the rousseau table. It would be the ideal set-up, but the arbor stinks on this one--with a 100 dollar new blade, it still scores up the cut--meaning I have to joint or sand every finished piece. You can see the wobble as you turn it on. I've heard the same complaint from other contractors, and it has been mentioned on this board. MAKITA WAKE UP! I would never buy this saw again if this weren't fixed--if it were, the saw would tear off the roof!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,"This is by far the worst Makita product I've ever purchased! I unfortunately didn't return it within the 30 day period. Now, I'm stuck with it. The fence is a joke. Getting the fence to clamp straight takes longer than cutting the piece by hand. The mitre guide is a joke. If you can live with +- 3 degrees you are ok. The guide fits very loosely in the table groove so its impossible to get an accurate cut. It's the worst $300 I've ever spent on a tool. You would be hard pressed to find a lower quality table saw. The only positive is that it is light and will be easy to throw in the dumpster."
1,Canadian English is not American English.,"Spellings of words like colour, centre, travelled as color, center, and traveled, are referred to as ""North American"" in origin implying that US and Canadian English are the same. I beg your pardon? Since when? Any true linquistics expert should know that Canada follows British English for the most part with a few exceptions here and there. This is an extremley lazy and ignorant compilation of the English language."
5,"""It Couldn't Be Any Sweeter""","I have used the the Makita 5007 NBK to cut 2x material for a housing framing/renovation project and it has handled superbly in all respects. It glides through straight lumber like the proverbial hot knife through butter. Important to an amateur builder, it is very easy to view the leading edge of the blade as I follow the marked line. Any problems not staying on line are strictly the fault of the operator.I have no problems with maintaining a consistent depth adjustment. I find it much easier to adjust the depth of cut than on my older Milwaukee 7 1/4"" circular saw.For ease of use and professional results it definitely rates 5 stars. Do yourself a favor and buy this saw no matter how many others you have in your toolbox."
5,Perfect for my home improvement projects,"While I can't give a review based upon using the saw on a daily basis, I can praise the saw for the work it does every time I need it. I have used other saws in the past, and this saw has outperformed them all. It's balance is wonderful, and I never been able to follow a line this closely. Oh yeah, it's powered through everything I cut without any problems. I've used it for over a year now without any problems. I highly recommend it."
2,Not Too Good,"I needed a replacment for my Black & Decker DYI cheapy which died while cutting brick. Got the Makita. Not good. It worked well for several hours. The thin base plate kept slipping under my guide, but the alignment guide alowed me to maitain a relatively straight cut. After a couple days, however, the blade no longer tracked with the alighnment mark. I called a Makita Factory Service Center (closest one was 4 hours away)and asked if there was any adjustment for tracking. They said no, but that they could fix it. I kept going for a few more days, then gave up. After 9 days use I returned it and bought a Porter-Cable. I realy liked the balance and power of the Makita. The base plate is too thin and loads up easily. When loaded up it is difficult to maintain a smooth cut. Bottom line: Not Good, but better than a Black & Decker cheapy though."
2,What happened,Do youreself a favor and preview these re-issued titles prior to buying the sacd. In my opinion if Bon Jovi released these sorry revisions in the eighties instead of thier originals they very likely would be flipping burgers today.
1,This album sounds like Bad Medicine,"If you are looking for an album of Bon Jovi covering their own songs in a soft rock style, then this is for you. If you want a compilation of the songs that made them famous as you remember them, the look elsewhere. At the risk of being overly negative, this album starts off bad and gets progressively worse...if I can stomach listening to it a few more times, it might grow on me, but that is a big IF!"
3,A wonderful second book by a gifted poet!,"""In her second book of poetry, ""Renderings,"" Nesselroad takes us on a much more intimate personal journey, further exploring feelings about herself, people and life in general. I especially enjoyed ""Expose,"" ""Eye of the Beholder,""and ""Sammy's Green Beret"" and look forward to seeing Nesselroad's continued growth as a poet. ""Renderings"" is wonderful and I recommend it wholeheartedly!""(...)"
5,Give it some time...,"I've used this product off and on for about six months now and I love it. One word of advice is to give it about 2 weeks to kick in, which is normal with most Hoodia products.Last week I was overeating like crazy (hormones didn't help) and this week, like magic, I have it all under control again and am pretty much forcing myself to eat, which is very rare for me.This stuff is great!"
4,It supressed my hunger and gave me energy!,"I bought this at my local food store for about the same price as it is on here and it really helps the hunger pains go away for a while. It also gives a boost of energy. This is a really effective product for the price and results. Combined with diet and exercise, this is a helpful tool!"
3,Going to have to stop taking it.,I was really excited about this product. I just wanted to lose about 10 lbs.I lost about 3lbs in 2 weeks and now I'm starting to get headaches everyday and some wierdtype of sharp stomach pain that lasts all day. I would love to keep taking it because it really made my cravingsand appetite go down and also I didn't have the need to drink coffee anymore so it kept me pretty alert. But I feellike my body is trying to tell me something with these stomach aches (which don't go away withfood) and maybe I should try something a little less potent like Mega T without the hoodia.I gave my review 3 stars because this product might work well for somebody else and it's worth a tryat least.
5,Our animal friends at mayple hill farm,"As a child this was my very favourite book. Filled with cat's,dog's horses cow's and chickens the whole book is a delight. Told from a realistic perspective it deals with life and death, the whole circle of life. The pictures as wonderfull at capturing the funny personaltites of the different animals. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough."
4,Maple Hill Farm,Bought as a gift for granddaughter. Loved the illustrations and the content of this wonderful book describing farm life. Recommend for any child.
5,A Classic Primer for Children,"This book is classic! A primer for Children on the nature of our relationship to animals, both domestic and wild, and on the cyclic nature of life. The story centers around farm life, and remains a favorite of mine from childhood. It is a favorite of my two children, as well, and provides an inspiring counterpoint to life in the suburbs. Wonderfully layered characters and illustrations bring values such as sharing, compassion, hard work, family and friendship to the fore, while the overall theme of birth and rebirth forms the background.A very poignant and honest book, sure to evoke an emotional response, and provide many opportunities for important discussions with children. Valuable as a picture book or a read-aloud, and appropriate for most any age or stage of development."
1,What an awful book!,"Overall, this book reads like a rambling essay written by a 4th grader. It's filled with inane and inappropriate details about farm life. I was disappointed from the start, but I stopped my read aloud altogether when got I got to the line, ""Max leaves gifts of guts and tails and chipmunk heads on the doorstep."" Not exactly a pleasant bedtime story..."
5,special book for animal lovers,"this was one of my favorite books as a child and now I read it to my child. It has whimsical watercolor drawings and I love the animals detailed idiosynchratic behavior & personality characteristics. I spent hours pouring over the informative facts about farm animals and rarely made it to the end of the book as a child! It really is a special book, written mostly in the first-person voice of a young person, not politically correct but realistic (only the safe, loving and contributing dogs were kept at the farm). Enjoy!"
3,Reacuring Nightmares,"This was my absolute favorite book as a young girl. I must have spent thousands of hours just looking over each characteristic of each animal. I used to have the same nightmare over and over as a child. It involved a mean, bad..., billy goat with red eyes. I haven't looked at this book for 5 minuets and 11 years. I just realized where my nightmares came from. It has been a phsycological breakthrough. Sam the Billy Goat. As I went on reading the book, now a full grown adult, there is some questions that raised about the evil characteristics of some of the animals. All I can say is beware...childrens books are powerful...ex: Where the Wild things are...enough rambling..."
1,"Great Movie, Sorry DVD","I watched half of this movie on webisodes and loved it! Hilarious with the makings of a classic. However, I ordered and returned 3 separate DVDs before I finally accepted the fact that the publisher obviously never QC'ed their product. Such a shame - the actors deserve better. Buyer Beware!"
1,DVD doesn't work,"Just like the reviewer below me, the DVD DOES NOT PLAY. How lame of the company to sell this dvd either knowing it doesn't work, or not trying to see if it does. This movie is funny, and I would like to own it, but it's hard to find, and buying it here on amazon clearly isn't an option either. Save your 7 dollars for gas or lunch or something else instead."
2,OK,"I was really looking forward to these and was disappointed. The flavor is more sausage than pepperoni. I can't find stick pepperoni in my new state and was hoping this would be my solution. Tastes vary from person to person. If you enjoy Hormel or Boar's Head pepperoni, this is very different."
4,Good Book,"The book is just the right size to keep in my backpack. I wish the plant descriptions included color photos or at least color illustartions. However, the illustrations are quite detailed and the descriptions are very helpful. I'm happy with the book, all in all, and the shipping was very fast."
2,In Between.,"Its hard for a book to be a identification plant guide without color photos. otherwise i wouldve given this item 5 stars. Would be a a good book for people who already know the plants and want to know more about them soo definetly not for begginers. overall its a in between book for me not too bad not too great i mean i only paid a dollar for it. so like a i said before,if your a begginner dont get this book first."
5,A candid and illuminating story of love and forgiveness,"Teresa LeYung Ryan's ""Love Made of Heart"" offers a candid and illuminating portrayal of a daughter's quest for self-forgiveness and a mother's struggle against a haunting past. Deceptively straightforward prose belies the layers woven into this often painful but always humane story, of family and the damage we inflict on one another in the name of duty; of the ghosts we try to hide from, and the ghosts we eventually must face. As we travel with protagonist Ruby Lin in her journey to discover the truth of her mother's breakdown, we come to find that we are, in the end, much alike, despite our cultural differences. This book is a must-read for anyone struggling with a family member suffering from mental illness, and for all of us for whom compassion and understanding walk hand-in-hand with the complex legacy of being human."
5,Leyung Ryan has universal appeal,"Publisher's Weekly's snide review notwithstanding, this is a lovely first novel. Rather than trying to be a fresh 'Asian' voice, the LeYung Ryan seemed to be using an Asian-american protagonist to deal with universal themes: The difficulties of being pulled in two cultural directions, the wounds of childhood, the awkward role reversal that takes place when a child is called on to care for a parent, the need to take a hard look at the past to gain freedom from its baggage. These themes and her treatment of them is neither cloying nor coy.This author shows a lot of promise and I'm looking forward to her next novel."
3,Cracked!,"Danzi's not cracked; it's the case! Oddly, it appears to have been very well packaged - perhaps, in storage, Danzi was trying to move ahead. Certainly, he should have an enhanced reputation - gorgeous music."
5,Looks great,"This license plate frame looks great on the back of my F150, always proud to display my service to the Army. Could not find an Army Veterin plate frame, but this one is just as great."
3,anchovey paste,"product is conveniently packaged and arrived quite promptly. It's easy to use, saves time, and helps present a perfect Caesar Salad. It works with several of my recipes..very well."
4,It is certainly full speed ahead in the name of power blues,"If you like power blues (a blend of blues and heavy metal), this album is absolutely for you! Pat Travers has chosen great songs to cover and it is full speed ahead all the way through this album. Even if Travers doesn't sing as good as Glenn Hughes, David Coverdale or Paul Rodgers, it's certainly suitable for this approach. For fans of Rick Derringer's more recent stuff, this is without doubt a treat."
5,"Don't mess around, get this one first","I'm not particulary brand loyal, but these people really build some fantastic tools. Not all Milwaukee stuff is great, but this drill has more power than most cordless drills, can take massive abuse, and lasts a long time on a charge. It has weaknesses (the triggers destroy themselves) but all in all a super top notch unit. I've been through several other brands, but this one is a keeper. I'm becoming convinced that if you want indestructable heavy duty tools, milwaukee is the way to go. All of my other milwaukee tools have taken such abuse it is amazing, but not even a dent or scratch.If you have a second battery and the quick charger, you never have to stop working. If you need to drive a 18"" long 1"" dia auger bit through huge timbers like I've done, this unit will do it effortlessly."
1,Nothing New,"Unless you didn't follow tennis at all in the 70's and 80's there's nothing in this book that will really tell you what you didn't already know. The author admits that she doesn't know much about tennis - and it shows. Even though its completely appropriate to focus on the subject of her book, the author completely dismisses the rest of the womens tennis tour. Some of the very people like Tracy Austin and Hana Mandlikova who were kind enough to give her an interview are then diminished by the author. A poor book from an author that should stick to what she knows."
5,So much more than just a sports book,"I fear I will be reiterating what many other reviewers have already said, but wanted to throw my 5 stars into the count. What a great book. I grew up watching many of the matches between Evert and Navratilova discussed in this book and the author does an amazing job recounting them. The back story is worked seamlessly into the book, giving you insight into what was really going on in the matches.I found the history fascinating. Much of the story takes place before Title IX, before gay rights, before women's rights. Makes you realize what pioneers these women were and how much they helped to change the world for the rest of us.If you have even only a casual interest in tennis, I highly recommend this book."
3,A Literary Second Serve,"In The Rivals, a middling addition to the tennis book industry, Johnette Howard argues that the Evert-Navratilova rivalry both reflected and changed women's tennis and women's role in professional sports. Fair enough. She also portrays the rivals as two intelligent, highly skilled and articulate women whose friendship was tested and strengthened by their on-court competition. Fair enough again. Also, the book is a quick, good read, albeit in the style of a 270 page sports column, where everybody always talks in the present tense. When all that is conceded though, what new perspective or insight does The Rivals bring to the party? In my view, not much, if anything, that couldn't be found by reading the autobiographies of the two champions, which Howard generously cites frequently. As for the writing on tennis here, there is nothing that can come close to John McPhee's classic Levels of the Game in recreating the context, tension, and skill of tennis at the highest levels."
4,Match Point (4.5 Stars),"This is a well-written account of women's tennis between the years of 1971 and 1987 as told through the stories of Martina and Chrissie (no last names needed!).In those years, there really weren't any other women stars with staying power, and these two women were the face of the sport. The contrast in their childhood upbringings and off-court relationships and training practices are covered well and thankfully not in laborious detail.I would have liked to hear more from Tracy Austin, Hana Mandlikova, and other players to help balance the Martina/Chrissie rememberances, but other than that, this book is very good."
4,Great read for tennis fans,I loved this book because it reminded me of when I used to actually watch tennis and especially women's tennis. I was in love with Chris Evert and loved the detail that is put into telling her story. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed the information I learned about Martina. A great read for anyone that grew up watching these two great athletes.
4,My Tamagotchi,"This is an opinion of a nine year old. This toy is OK. It falls apart easily. When it was dropped the ball fell off. The chain fell off after awhile. Playing with it is fun. You can also go onto the computer and play games. Its frustrating to wait until it becomes an ""adult"" (where you can get a job) and do more fun things. The passwords are hard and complex to remember. if you wait too long the password screen clears, then you need a new password. The games on the tamagotchi itself are fun. [...]"
5,A Piece of History,"What can you say about a group that withstood the test of time? As a little girl I can remember hearing their hits from my fathers 8 track tape player. Songs like, I Just Don't Want To Be Lonely and Rolling Down A Mountainside. Each time I hear these songs, they transport me to a happier time, to a simpler time when everything was fun and music still had meaning. Here's to you Main Ingredient. Thank you for giving us your best!"
3,misleading,"Make sure you check the item number before you order. I was aware the rip fence for the Makita 5377mg is supposed to be gold, so in my haste i clicked on the photo featuring the gold colored fence. The one i received was however, not the correct one. After double checking item numbers my mistake was revealed. The color of the rip fence in the photo of item number 164818-4 is incorrectly gold and is not compatible with the 5377mg."
3,good product but it took forever to get here,"It took 5 week to finally arrive, however it was the right item and it works fine."
4,insporational,I received this book myself over 50 yrs. ago and was delighted to find it available on amazon. I am giving it to my grandsons on their 16 th birthday.
2,Close but not quite,"In their earlier days Collectables did a lot of lame releases off of poor vinyl. Nice try here, but the quality of restoration is not the best on some tracks. I'd certainly opt for one of the newer packages of this artist."
3,Crosman /Walther /Umax/ NightHawk,"I own both the CPSport and the NightHawk. Basically they are both the same gun. They look and feel nice. They are not powerful with only 365-to-385fps but shoot well. The Nighthawk is a dressed up CPSport the safety is a little different on the Nighthawk but it loads and handles the same.They both have the same problem. The Trigger pull is way too long. You almost have to pull it all the way against the frame to get it to fire. I wrote the manufacture and they said that it was not adjustable (Sorry.) The second problem is loading the gun. If you are not holding the gun directly upright the pellet cylinder falls out when you pop open the breech. I've handed it to other friends and watched them make the same mistake when they opened the breech.Overall, it is a very nice airgun to add to your collection. Not exactly match quality but fun to shoot."
2,"Not really a calorie burner just a ""get moving"" dvd",This dvd was a pretty sorry one. I don't exactly care for the Firm videos but I thought this one would be different for some reason.If you like the other Firm dvds then you'll probably like this one. It's just a big bore for me. The trainers are pretty boring & if you don't have good rhythm you won't be able to keep up. I couldn't get my heart rate up high enough with this one. Neither workout was really a cardio BURN.
3,Not the Original Firm but... okay,"The original Firm Volumes 1, 2, 4, 6 are my favorite. I still use it 25 years after I first purchased them. The workouts of most new Firms are not as challenging, fun or motivating but this one's pretty good. It does get your heart rate up, not like volume 3, but a good workout to add to the mix. There are two instructors: Emily Walsh and Rebekah Sturkie. Emily is a good instructor but her high pitch munchkin voice gets annoying after awhile. Also, for a fitness instructor, she is not in good shape - so much more motivation when the instructor is fit. Rebekah is good but her thick southern accent is a bit dstracting.Not my favorite but a solid workout to add into the weekly mix."
5,"Great Workout, saw result in one week","I have purchased the Firm weight loss system a week ago, and since the first workout I got really motivated and energyzed, I didn't feel like eating and just loved my body in those moves that I felt I could cut on food to see more results. I did the workout every day until today. In the morning I checked the balance and I lost 4 pounds. I think it is the best decision I have taken for my weight loss. I want to lose about 12 pounds and I feel I am on the right track with this workout. I love it! I would recommend it for women with less time or who do not feel comfortable going to the gym."
5,Very Motivating!!,"I just purchased this DVD and went right to the Interval b/c of other reviews saying Rebekah was annoying. How wrong that is! She was motivating, energetic and fun. Too fast of a workout? It was fast, but definitely not a hindrance at all! Just enough to get it right before the sequence was done and an encouragement to do it better the next time! It was done in 20 minutes, and I was sweating long after even after taking a shower!! Emily is always great. Just previewed that one since I just finished the other. Can't wait to get to that one next! YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY PLEASED IF YOU PURCHASE THIS DVD!!"
3,Mind-blowingly fast paced,"This video was way too intense for me. My real complaint, however, is she jumps right in and continues just jumping right into each move (all of them combo moves) without any warning. By the time I processed that we were doing jump lunges with side step lunges that ended in a clap, suddenly we were throwing our arms left, right, up and down while jumping and kicking, with no heads up. And as the cherry on top, the video is at a rapid fire pace. I'm 50 lbs overweight and very out of shape. However, fitness used to be a priority to me, so many strength training moves and the idea ""pushing through the burn"" isn't new to me. But ten minutes of straggling behind left me with an almost palpable sense of defeat and an ache that will last for days. It will be months before I am ready to follow along to this video...but the fault isn't entirely my own. When I'm ready for it, though, and after several reviews of the video, it will most definitely be one kick butt cardio session."
2,Not for beginners but does the job,"My co-worker and I had a hard time keeping up with this. It's definitely not for beginners, but if you are able to keep up it's a good 20 minute work out. Even though my co-worker and I couldn't keep up, it had has sweating within the 1st 10 minutes! I would suggest warming up before starting it because the instructor goes immediately into the workout w/out warming up."
4,"Cute, but not nearly enough balls!","We bought this for my son who is a huge Thomas fan. Unlike the other reviews we had no issues with it deflating all the time.It is cute, my son loves it, but the 50 balls that come with it only cover about half of the bottom of the pit, which we were extremely disappointed over.If you plan on buying this item I would suggest buying a minimum of at least another 100 balls, but 200 (or more) would most likely be the better way to go."
2,Play area too small,The toy itself is cute and my daughter loved it when she saw it christmas morning. Downsides: I added 100 extra balls and balls were everywhere. Any movement and balls spill out. Area of actual play is great for a one year old but otherwise it is too small for my 3 yr. old. Looks much bigger in picture.
3,Won't stay inflated,"We bought this for Christmas. We had the same problem at the previous reviewer. It deflated overnight. We would re-inflate it, only to have it deflate again. We could not find a hole to patch, so we returned it. The boys had lots of fun with it before it deflated. It is a good size. I like the higher walls and the larger play area. (The gumball ball pit does not provide any room to actually play!) You would probably need to buy more balls. We already had over 100 balls to add."
5,"What U R looking for, though you may not know it!","I'm relatively new to NWW's music, but I've recently been snapping up everything I can get my hands on! No two albums are the same, but this is the entry point, one of the best. There is incredible variety within this album, with ambient segments alternating with more manic stretches, like The Faust Tapes, only both more cohesive and more diverse. Keyboard drones, pipe organ blasts, spaced out electronics, honky-tonk piano, meditative reeds, generator rumble, chirping birds, banjos, jags of noise, phased out martial beats, dubbed out kazoos, bowed pianos, rattling tin cans, guitar skronk,tape loop insanity....it's all here!"
4,Innovative story makes for a can't-put-down reading,"I usually pick up books like this to pass the time when I fly around for work. I never made it to the airport with this one. This read was so good I ended up finishing it days before my trip.Many stories out there fit the cookie cutter mold when it comes to naval warfare: allies v axis, allies win, axis scurries home. This plot, dealing with powers within NATO to find a new world leader, break the mold completely.Recommended hands down for anyone who enjoys a good read and cares about the technical accuracy of the work."
5,As great a military thriller as I've ever read!,"Jeff Edwards couples his years of military experience with a gift for storytelling and spins a magnificent tale that any techno- or military-thriller fan will enjoy. He does a truly wonderful job of making the reader feel that he is right there on the bridge or in the wardroom during difficult decisions, and as far as the action, it never stops! I also really enjoyed how he weaves a bit of educational material on torpedo development throughout the book, educating as well as entertaining the reader. This one goes on my shelf next to Tom Clancy and Dale Brown. Jeff Edwards earned it."
2,My review,Nic. Good technical thriller it made me feel like i was in the navy. Plenty of action a real page turner.
2,Very tedious,"The plot is implausible, the dialogue stilted, and the writing weak. Two people recommended this book to me, neither veterans. Only a vet would know that repeatedly addressing subordinates as ""Son,"" the radio sequences and myriad other things are wrong and extremely grating for those of us who've also been there.I guess if you are into fantasy, this book is fine, but if you're looking for a realistic thriller, this absolutely isn't it."
1,"Be careful, it is an re-edited work of Topedo. Do not buy!","I had thought that this was another great work of Jeff Edwards, only to find its a slimmer version of the first book, ""Topedo"".If Jeff is going down the road with such edited work in the future, I am sorry to say that I will not longer support your work."
