4,Another great story,I really liked the story. The only downfall was how short the story was. Because of this it lacked some of the magic that Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry Had.
4,I Liked This Story,This story is about hard times for colored people right after slavery times.It is suspenceful and makes you want to read on and on. I recomend this book for any one who likes to read even a little. This story is very irate.
2,could do better,I am so disappointed. The writing is unadjustably too small and the penmanship style is questionable. sorry I Brought this one ~ Can't read it.
3,Paint chips off,"The black paint on these weights tends to come off as powder, especially around the holes. It's not a big deal but it shows the quality."
4,Good plate for the money,"These plates are nothing special, but they are a great deal. They smell like fresh paint when you get them, which was a little noxious in my opinion, but they get the job done."
5,Great Plates,These were the cheapest 10lb dumbbell plates I could find on amazon at the time and are working great for me.No complaints.
4,Nice weights. As advertised.,"10 lbs each with the right sized hole. Oh yea, the holes are in the center of the plate. Perfect!!"
4,99.8% Awe inspiring,"Okay, I just got this movie for Christmas and I just finished watching it. I watched this movie before, but it has practically constructed me into a Marjane Satrapi fan(Don't take that literally).So, the movie is about a girl who matures from a 9 year old to an adult, living through the Islamic Revolution and a number of wars in Tehran, soon moving to Vienna and France.I understand the movie is supposed to be mostly serious, but it periodically had it's comedy, such as people having fangs when angry.So, to conclude this review, it was a great movie to watch and whoever reads this review I recommend the movie to."
5,super buena,"me gusto mucho, es entretenida con humor y drama, indispensable para entender mas de la cultura irani"
5,One of the best French movies!,"The animation is superb, and the characters are rich and exciting. A great story line of a girls journey from one culture to another and growing up whilst doing it."
4,Powerful story,"Very interesting and insightful story, especially for those who don't really understand or know too much about the Iranian Revolution. This animation was moving, yet disturbing. If you want an idea of what it's like to live in a repressive society, this is a good film to start.Definitely not for children. A dark film, leaves you feeling how precious freedom and family are."
5,A gem,"The movie is a gem. Extremely funny and entertaining, yet you get to peek at the complex political events that unfolding in Iran over the last few decades. Universally touching."
1,Persepolis DVD,The book is definitely better than the DVD. The movie leaves a lot out. I wouldn't really waste my money on it. It is also in cartoon form like the drawings in the book.
1,No English Subtitle,The DVD language is in French and the only available subtitles in this DVD are French and Turkish which makes it useless for English Lnaguage Countries.
2,No wonder show was canceled,I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for a long time and usually caught his shows on television. I decided to order a couple of his DVD's of shows I had not seen. The Jeff Dunham Show DVD is very disappointing to say the least. For Dunham's characters to interact with actual people in the shows was a mistake. Dunham and his puppets are great when he is on stage with them. After watching The Jeff Dunham Show DVD I can see why the show was canceled.
2,kind of a let down,"Jeff Dunham is Very Talented & usally hilarious.Needs some new material, some is so old everyone knows your script word for word. Even went to see him & MOST of it was old material that we already seen and heard before.Don't need all the ""Drug"". ""Gay"" Racial stuff! He is very funny without all of that stuff. Just stick to comedy and leave all of that stuff out of it & it would be much better. Still, not for kids, but adults.Don't get me wrong, Jeff is very funny, but needs new material & leave out all that drug, gay, guns, & racial stuff.Favorites are Walter and Peanut CharactersHope he comes out with a new DVD with new cleaner material!"
3,Not getting better,"The first episode was pretty good, but this one was unnecessarily crass and vulgar, which was surprising. I didn't recall that much low-brow humor in his Comedy Central specials. Well, I probably won't buy another episode."
4,I love Jeff's DVD's,"I haven't looked at the show yet, but Jeff is always great. I look forward to new releases."
1,??? Do you really want to buy this????,"As I say in my title do you really want to buy this? I really love the heck out of Jeff Dunham but unfortunately his new TV show just doesn't have it and actually the second season has been canceled, but in by another review from CNN I heard that Comedy Central is going to keep Jeff Dunham because they have multilevel agreements with him but the TV show is gone. There are a few funny moments in the seven episodes of his first season but I purchased it because I don't watch TV I watch DVDs. But in less you are a dedicated fan of his work I would not buy this DVD, I would purchase his former DVDs which are hilarious and will keep laughing over and over again when you watch them. Even though this was only $10 at Amazon I am going to keep it because I am an avid fan of Jeff Dunham. I hope my review helped you in any way. Thank you."
3,"Not enough ""there,"" there","I love Jeff Dunham, and most of his characters, but this show just doesn't have enough content to support the amount of commercials throughout each episode. I'll stick to his specials...much more entertainment for the dollar!"
1,disappointing,I have seen a couple of the Jeff Dunham shows; this one did not live up to my or my husbands expectations. I was so excited about receiving the CD that I invited people over to see it. You could actually hear the lack of laughter.
1,The Jeff Dunham Show Is Not Your Stage Show Idea,"If you are OK with realy vulger humor, then this DVD is for you. I was very disapointed in this DVD it is not what I have come to like about Jeff and his early and current Stage Shows. I know that he has some vulgarity to his humor on Stage, but, not every joke is like these shows where."
2,The first time I've seen Jeff Dunham and NOT laughed,"I laughed out loud at Jeff's previous specials, especially Spark of Insanity. But this ""Jeff Dunham Show"" really is a shocker. I had high hopes of being entertained but was left wondering ""what happened?"" Granted there are a few funny skits, but a lot of Jeff's material has gotten crude and inappropriate: lots of racism, sexism, and stereotyping to the point where he crosses the line at times. I'm disappointed in Jeff for resulting to this type of humor. Achmed enlisting in the US Army: funny. Brooke Hogan going on a date with Peanut and he has an allergic reaction to the food: snore (plus there is OBVIOUS promotion for her CD.) Achmed watching his first adult film with his taekwondo instructor: are you serious? Rent this for free from your local library before spending money on it... you'll thank me later."
2,A bit disappointed,I bought this because I own every other dvd of Jeff Dunham's shows and have to say that this one was a disappointment. They were not as funny and the humor was definitely off key and not up to par. Had I known this before I probably wouldn't have bought it. Since my purchase Ive only watched it twice.
1,DVD doesn't work,"Good day, I received this DVD but it give an error and doesn't want to play on the DVD player."
2,disappointed,love Jeff Dunham on stage but was disappointed in the show for it wasn't very funny half the time. Its like something is missing.
4,vent,Not quite what I expected. They are good shows but too much in between each show and the DVD seems really long. Dunham is always funny and great to watch. Such a good variety of characters.
3,Jeff Dunham Show,"I think that Jeff Dunham is very bright and funny. I've watched and rewatched his DVDs which I am pleased to have bought and have gifted to friends. Unfortunately, his TV show is not as good as his DVDs. Still, it's enjoyable to see him and his characters again, but they are all more humorous on his DVDs."
2,Region locked - not specified,This product is locked for use only in Region 1. Previous releases from Jeff Dunham has been open for all regions. I have bought three DVD's and can't use any of them cause I live in a Region 2 area. Damn!
4,Entertaining New Direction for Jeff's cast of characters,"This show is a lot of fun, especially if you are familiar with Jeff's stand up ventriloquism act.If you've never seen a prior Jeff Dunham stand-up show, rent Spark of Insanity so that you are familiar with the characters. Then you'll really like this ""variety"" show."
2,Disappointed,This DVD was not nearly as funny as I had hoped. I have watched many of Jeff Dunhams shows and this was the worst in terms of entertainment.
4,not as good as it could have been,I love his show but the dvd's don't do him justice. going to a concert this week and look forward to that.
4,jeff dunham show review,"enjoyed this very much he rankes up there with terry fator, like his dvd so much iam going to a show in wisconsin to see him.they are very funny"
1,One of the worst things I've ever seen,I've heard many good things of Jeff Dunham and his legion of puppets. This? This is what everyone is clamoring about? One of the worst shows I've ever had the displeasure to lay my eyes upon. They even managed to slip in a plug for a Brooke Hogan CD. Need I say more?
3,The Jeff Dunham Show,"Not at all as good as Arguing with Myself or Spark of Insanity,these two I would recommend but don't waste your money on the show dvd."
1,Disappointing!,"Having only watched Jeff Dunham on Comedy Central, I assumed his DVD's would be snippets of his performances there. I don't believe this one is - if it is, I apologize. We love Jeff Dunham and most of his characters. But this tape was awful!"
1,Jeff Dunham,"This was sent in timely manner, good condition. He is funny guy, but this was a little risque for my taste."
1,CD-R/RW?,"Does anyone know if this item plays burned CD's? Doesn't say anything about CD-R/RW/MP3 playback, so I would asssume it will not be compatible with recorded discs....can anyone verify that for me?THANKS!!!"
2,Only lasted a short time,"This radio only worked well for about 6 months, then it died. I replaced the batteries with brand new ones, and it still wouldn't work. It was never dropped, but stopped working. I only got some of the stations, it couldn't pick up a lot of them. It is a little big and bulky, especially for the shower area. I've had other radios (non shower type) for 15 years and never had a problem. I would never buy another one for the shower, they just don't last."
2,Very unhappy with quality of unit,Opened the unit and within an hour had it repacked to send back. Very pool quality of construction and lousy sound. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
3,FYI,"In response to ""A Guest"" in Virgina, I believe you wrote a review for the wrong product. You state your tuning knob has become stuck but this product has no tuning knob as it uses a digital tuner. Just thought others should know this. I havn't used this shower radio yet but I plan to pick one up after I received a Spectra shower radio (CR-500) for christmas which has broken after about a week, stay away from that one..."
4,I thought it was great!,Linda always delivers a winner and this novel is no exception. Dream Song is a touching and tender love story that takes readers back to the Frontier. A good read! Don't miss it!
4,A simple book for simpler times.,"As a young boy, I read my fathers collection (4 books) of Tom Swift by Victor Appleton, which lured me to reading the entire series of Tom Swift by Victor Appleton Jr. Reading them again brings me back to happier times of childhood when everything was much simpler, less confusing and you had to use your imagination. I enjoyed the time travel back to my youth."
5,Greece Under Turkish Rule.,"I was excited to see that this author's book had been reprinted and I was not disappointed. For anyone interested in how the Greeks managed to survive foreign rule - not only the Turks but the Venetians and others- for almost four centuries, this book is an indispensable addition to one's library.Very detailed account and well sourced."
3,Don't let this be your introduction to Bartholomew Gill,"This is not a bad book, and I only give it a half hearted review because I bought it believing I would get more of a historical thriller instead of detective novel. I know, my fault. The other thing is that even if I had loved the content so much of McGarr's past was given away in this book that I have no need to get the other books since I know their endings already. Overall not a bad book, but I thought the character of Orla Bannon was wasted. She was the best part for me and seemed underutilized, and I did not like the way she was portrayed just before the final act...., you will see what I mean when you read it. As I said, if you like a good detective romp get an earlier McGarr book (good writing, but somewhat dark wit), since you will have the answers to those revealed to you in this one."
5,Ski Naked!,"If you like to ski and party this is a classic. Not only are the ski scenes great, but if you've been around awhile you'll get a kick out of the equipment we use to use. My wife and I first went to Squaw Valley before we were married, and love to pick out places we remember. We watch this movie before every ski trip!"
5,80's+skiing+nudity = awesomeness!,"This movie (along with Aspen Extreme) pretty much defines the 80s ski scene. The cast is great, the acting is horrible and the soundtrack can't be beat. Once you watch you'll want to hit the slopes in your neon one piece representing the rat pack. Just watch out for those Austrians!"
4,hot dog: the movie,"This movie has great action scenes and some great scenes. Of all the ""sport"" movies that came out during the 1980's this is the best one of the group. This is a must purchase for any fan of the 1980's movies."
3,The one that started the T&A/beer 80's movie craze,"I watched this movie all summer during junior high when it premiered on HBO. Absolutley irreverent, sexist and hilarious. Things that are missing in comedy movies these days"
5,Gotta Watch It Every Year,"Every fall we invite all our skiing friends over for some beer, and our annual viewing of this movie. If this doesn't get you in the mood for skiing (and some other moods as well) nothing will. We've just about worn our copy out. I keep looking for a DVD release, but I guess the snow snakes have it."
3,just a fun ski movie,"just a fun ski movie, but I had seen it in the 80s and just wanted to see it again. Yes its a bit cheesey but there are not many ski movies to watch."
4,What about the sound track....?,"All these gushing reviews with barely any reference to the sound track?! Mitch Rider doing Prince's ""When you were mine"" alone is worth the price of admission. Great ski scenes, Sonny-side-up, and Wooooody-kazooty. An all-time classic.Best line of the movie- ""This is Squirrel, Kendo, and.....Banana pants."" David Naughten obviously forgets the line he's supposed to say and comes up with ""banana pants"". Where is the Oscar committee?"
4,Hot Dog--A great gas of a movie!,"This is a decent story about skiing, partying, and hi-jinks and low-brow humor. Watch for two stars--Dan, played by David Naughton--remember the Dr. Pepper commercials and the TV show ""Makin' It'? and Sunny played by Tracy N. Smith who co-starred in Bachelor Party as a friend of the bride. There are so many memorable characters in this movie! 'Snake Leg' Banks, Michelle 'Banana Pants', Squirrel Murphy, Kendo, Rudi, etc. Lots of fun. Shannon Tweed is in this, too. She was a Playboy Playmate of the Year. Look for the Chinese Downhill, Squirrel's reaction in the hi-speed chair lift, and the part when Dan lets everyone know he got 'hurt' by hitting a tree. Good skiing shots, too. Need a DVD of this!"
3,"Pretty good, for some reason.","I really feel kinda guilty for enjoying this movie - the acting was terrible, the ski scenes were good but they sped up the film and tilted the camera in spots to make it look more dangerous, Shannon Tweed was pretty but looked totally plastic... and yet I still find myself quoting the ""stay out of ze middle"" and ""Chinese Downhill"" lines every so often. As ""Summer Fun"" films go, this is one of the better ones. Not something I pull out very often but still amusing - though I've never been quite sure why."
3,Good only if you're on a guys ski trip,"We watched this while in Tahoe skiing and it was a lot of fun... for the guys in the audience. That said, it's objectively a pretty awful movie"
4,Funny & Sexy,Lots of sex and nudity in this movie set in ski country. Do not recommend to let children see it.
4,Skiing is good,Old time classic. Brings me back to the days of ski bumming. Story line not so great. Lots of good skiing.
5,Classic - 1980's ski bum movie.,"So I bought this DVD but hadn't watched the movie in years. I told my co-worker (who happens to be a lesbian) that it's a hilarious ski bum movie from the 1980's and she should watch it. So she asked to borrow it, and I said sure!She watches it. She returns it.She said, ""Wow, there was a lot of hetrosexual sex in that movie!"" LOLI had completely forgot about all the nudity and silly sex scenes, and I loaned it to a female coworker. LOL oops!"
5,Hot Dog...The Movie,"Hot Dog is one of the all time classic 80's ski movies. Filled with the awesome daffy days of freestyle skiing and combined with the wild parties of Mountain Legend, this movie never gets old. You honestly can watch this 10 times and still laugh. A must for any ski house."
3,HELP I NEED TO FIND THIS MOVIE,CAN ANYONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND THIS MOVIE? NEED AS A GIFT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
2,"So Bad, It's Immortal","Along with ""Duets"" and ""The Mirror Has Two Faces,"" ""Hot Dog: The Movie"" is my favourite film for getting my MST 3000 practice in.I give it two stars rather than one, because of the truly awesome skiing jumps and stunts. However, I can get that from watching the Olympics every four years, or from viewing ABC's ""Wide World of Sports"" during the winter months.Otherwise, this flick would more aptly be titled ""Cheese Dog."""
4,Solid collection,"No, it's not the most complete Emmylou Harris collection, but it's good if you want a few hits just on one cd. It's a great cd for a casual fan to pick up. Big time Harris fans will want to pick it up for the excellent new track ""The Connection"" which is simply stunning. It's nice to have a collection like this, where nearly every album is represented. All the songs are a delight and show the strength of one of the best country singers from our generation."
4,Emmylou Harris: Heartaches and Highways,"I have loved the artist for years. I don't think she could ever do badly. As with all albums, some are more to my liking than others. My favorite album by her is SpyBoy. Still all her works are worth owning."
4,Great cd,"As usual, Emmylou Harris doesn't disappoint. I love listening to this cd and never tire of it - would recommend."
5,Classic,"How can you go wrong with this voice? She is such a wonderful talent. If you have heard her, then you will enjoy this again. If you have never heard this classic voice, listen. She is a music legend."
4,One fault---this needed to be a two-disk set!,"Otherwise, it's wonderful. Really does span the years, but I think there are some places where more emphasis is needed and would have preferred to see a second disk to do it."
4,The Very Best of Emmylou HarriS: Heartaches and Highways,"Well worthwhile for a best of collection if you have none of her other recordings. The first 13 cuts are standard country fare, while the other 7 are great crossover arrangements."
3,It's a nice sampler,"While there are no dud selections on this CD, anyone who agrees that this is ""The Very Best of Emmylou Harris,"" is just crazy. To reduce a body of work that spans more than 35 years, by one of the best artists of that period, to just 20 songs barely enables a listener to hear the best of the best. And, I wouldn't agree that this collection is the best of the best. If her label could put out the four CD Songbird collection, why couldn't they do her the justice of doing something similar for this effort?"
3,Cute -- the kids love it!,"The funk it is cute to watch, and it works with regular mp3's, not just Ipods, which is nice. I thought it would dance in sync wth the music, but it just has it's own beat, regardless of the music. I thought for the money there would be a little more to it. That being said, the kids get a kick out of it. It is an ok set of speakers with a little entertainment on the side."
2,Disappointed!!,I returned the first one I ordered because the lights were not multi-colored as stated in the description--the second one was the same still no multi-colored lights ONLY blue--I did keep it because I was tired of running to the Post Office or UPS to return it!! Please update your description of this item!!
1,Don't Order!!!!,"Piece of crap. Not compatible with Ipod Touch and I got my son one for Christmas. Instructions are in SPANISH only. Cute to look at, but that is it."
1,BIG WASTE OF $60,"Yes, that is what I paid for this piece of Junk...Came with Spanish instructions, guess what? we don't read or speak Spanish, 4G does not work on it. If I could find the person that sold this, not sure what I would do!"
1,Don't waste your Money!,"This product does not work with most I-PODSs. I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas, the instructions were in other languages, but not English. She was unable to use it because her I-pod was incompatible - it also didn't work with any of her friends I-PODS either."
1,WTH!,"REALLY?! I totally got ripped off! Complete piece of junk, and I BOUGHT 4 of 'em for my nieces and nephews! Doesnt work anywhere near like I expected.... iPod touch does NOT charge UNLESS you plug funkit into a pc. Funkit does NOT play the music from iPod through the funkit speakers. If you are looking for something to HOLD your iPod touch with blinking lights than this is the piece of junk for you! Funkit should be called JUNKIT! AHHHHHHH!!"
3,Make sure your Ipod works with this!,"Be sure your type of Ipod works on this!! We have two - both 4th Generation Ipods - one that plays without headphones, one that needs the headphones ... the speakers work on the older one that does not play without the use of headphones but will not work with the newer one. Was not aware of that beforehand. Worth the money as son has enjoyed with the one Ipod but definitely be sure it will work with your Ipod beforehand."
3,Bought on a recommendation,"The taste is fine as along as you use two tea bags, otherwise it is weak in flavor. However, I bought this product on a recommendation from 'first' magazine. I am always looking for the most healthy products."
1,Stash Darjeeling tea,I've been a fan of Stash's Fusion Green & White tea for a long time and decided to try the Darjeeling Green. Very disappointing - I'm giving the stuff to a food drive.
3,2 out of 3 are good,"I agree with the other reviewer, the bronze brush is poor quality. I also purchased the ""Ois No.45 Brush (44, 444, 45, 458)"" which is a premium quality brush that comes in a protective tube instead of just packaging. the cotton cleaning swab and the spiral wound ""Tornado brush"" (aka gunsmiths bore cleaner brush) are both durable"
2,Cherokee 87,"The walker exhaust gasket #31519 IS shown wrong in the picture. The gasket they show is the one between manifold and exhaust pipe, but #31519 is the gasket between exhaust pipe and convertor"
1,Not the gasket in the picure,"The gasket in the picture looks like a ""donut"" gasket that seals the pipe to the manifold. The gasket you will receive will be a flat gasket that goes between the front of the catalytic converter and the pipe that comes from the engine. Beware"
1,Misleading,"Dissapointed. No words to use with your Karokee machine. Instrumental only. No personel contact after e-mailing the company,auto reply only."
3,A Slow Burner,"A group of low budget film makers attempt to finish making a horror moviein an old mansion with a murderous past.Old time horror legend John Carradine has a small but effective rolealong with John Ireland who is clearly enjoying the role of a short tempered movie director.The movie is slowly paced, but this helps the atmosphere, in fact it isnot until the hour mark that anything really happens. This helps to build up a palpable sense of dread, and there are some nice insights into the world of low budget film making. Recommended for fans of 60's/70's B movies, looking for something more accomplished."
4,Not bad...,"I first saw this on TV a while ago, and loved it. At times it seemed it went from color to black and white, it flickered colors at you, and the sound suddenly changed volume. So when I ordered it on VHS, I wasn't expecting much. It's not the greatest quality, but it was a lot better than the TV's quality.The story itself is a bit interesting... and after watching how many times I still don't get the ending, but it kept my attention. Nothing like the newer movies coming out. I don't go to movies just for the fact I'd probably fall asleep due to a stolen plot/story that I've already seen before.Some of the actors are just pathetic. You just want to meet them in person to kill them. What do you expect, though?If you have money to spend, buy it. If you haven't seen it before, don't buy it till you see it."
1,A waste of Celluloid,"After reading some of the glowing reviews, I took a chance on this film. I didn't have high expectations knowing that it was a low budget film.In contrast to some of the reviews, the acting was too melodramatic, the sound quality wasn't that great, the script was dull and the entire film is too dated for today's audience, even for ""B"" movie fans.Rent it first before deciding on purchasing it. Otherwise you may kick yourself for wasting money on a film you won't view a second time."
4,Hard to put on but worth it!,"These are great. Maybe a little pricier than regular tubes, but you'll definitely get your money's worth out of these. We had bought some of the 20"" tubes for our kids bikes for Christmas last year and we had a really hard time putting them on. But the kids loved them and of course we haven't had to air up or fix one tire. We live out in the country with gravel roads and lots of pastures to ride in, so these are great. I thought we might have gotten the hang of it by putting the tubes on the kids bikes last year, but no such luck. It still took us at least an hour per tube, so be patient if you get these. But think of all the time you're saving in the long run by never having to fix a flat again!"
1,Pure Garbage,"Bottom line: too soft, doesn't fit well.I installed it for my mom because she does not like to blow up the tires; she is in her 80's. The tire moves and shifts over the Bell product especially during turns which is a hazzard. I weigh 205 and it feels like its partially flat when I tested it out. Most importantly its not a TUBE. It can't be inflated. This product should be taken off the market. Its not safe."
4,no-mor flats,"no-mor flats,feels a little mushy,breaking 12g spokes on ebike,6 in 30 days,but no worrying about flats anymore."
5,I love me some Chiclets!!,This gum is a throw back to my childhood! I loved it then and happy I can still find it now! I like that it is offered in a big pack as I hate to run out! I am not a big sugar free gum person so these little squares are small little pops of fun to chew! They make excellent bubbles too!
3,Over charged shipping,"Product was great, it just cost ""WAY"" to much to ship this little pack of gum, never agaion............Thank YouStephanie Cadigan"
1,Not the same,"Chiclets has been my favorite gum for years, though it can only be bought in a limited number of stores. The last three packs have seemed very different...harder texture is all I can describe. Does anyone else notice a difference, or is it just me?"
1,Chiclets Peppermint Flavored Chewing Gum 20-12 piece pkgs,I keep hoping there will be one pack that is not stale. This package of gum is absolutely horrible. When I buy them in the store I can chew the gum for hours. This package of gum I can only chew for 15 to 30 minutes. I am so sorry I bought this gum. It is stale.
1,There's nothing like the REAL THING! :o(,"I LOVE Bruch's viola works. And I was curious as to how the double concert would sound with a violin (and I play both violin and viola), and it should NOT be this way. The tempo is too fast, and I feel like it's glitzy. If you love the Double Concerto like I do, I recommend you listen to:Max Bruch: Works For Clarinet And Viola [IMPORT]Max Bruch (Composer), Kent Nagano (Conductor), Lyon Opera Orchestra (Orchestra), Gerard Causse (Performer), Paul Meyer (Performer), Francois-Rene Duchable (Performer).The viola and clarinet are perfect matches, the VIOLIN and viola are great with MOZART. Not Bruch. Such a shame!"
1,Say it Ain't So!!,"Let me say, the Bruch Double Concerto was written for viola and CLARINET, not violin. It just does not give off the same color and vibe with a violin. Keep the music as it was originally written, don't modify it by switching instruments around. I have played that piece before, and there just wasnt enough expression in any of the movements, just notes...too many notes."
1,CAUTION! This is not a pack of 12 CDRS!,I was looking for a fairly cheap pack of a small amount of CDRs to make my order up to the minimum to get free shipping. I guess i should perhaps have known better as $5.99 for 12 discs does look too good to be true in hindsight. Besides there was no descrptive text with the item. Low and behold when it arrived it was indeed only one disc. So we are returning it hoping that amazon will agree that that it should have been described a little better. Im presuming that the x12 refers to speed or capacity or something - but not everyone would realize or even know this.
2,Very easily came undone with shoulder straps!,I used the bag about 4 times to carry my rather light Yamaha P-95 keyboard to band practice (only 26 pounds). The bag tore out the seems under where the shoulder straps connect to the bag. I can see where they absolutely should not have put the ability to connect shoulder straps with such low quality seem connection. So... you CANNOT use the bag with shoulder straps. I now have a bag with 2 wide open seems to the insides of the bag - not good.
5,"Nice, reasonably-priced bag","I have a heavy, older 88-key keyboard, and I needed to transport it from the house to the car, from the car to the hotel and around the hotel for the weekend. I felt that the keyboard was completely protected in this thickly-padded bag, and the keyboard fit perfectly. I wish the pockets on the side were a bit bigger, but they are fine for sheet music and thin music books. The price on this bag was quite reasonable. I was very happy with my purchase."
5,Another winner,"Kevin's fans will be delighted with this CD, another of his inimitable mixes of music from many sources. The songs seems so simple, but they burrow into your unconscious and don't let go."
2,Don't Bother...,"...If you were a fan of his 80's band Crumbacher...then this is NOT for you! While his band was current and relevant, this is nothing but the typical Adult Contemporary soft music that is killing Christian music. Only two upbeat songs on this one and the guitars are so far in the back of the mix on those songs they may as well be non-existent. Pick up his Crumbacher group cd's and avoid this one."
2,Do not buy this system!,"I purchased this system for my daughter's X-mas present and we only used it a few times and then the microphones started humming. They wouldn't stop no matter what we did. The only way that you could totally stop the hum was to either turn the mic down all the way (so that you couldn't hear yourself sing) or unplug the mic. It also has way too low wattage speakers to get any kind of decent sound and is very static sounding. Even though the price is low, it's not worth buying."
4,Good Office Chair,This is a great chair for a medium build guy. It is a expensive item but has a good warranty to the original purchaser.
4,Some Good Sampling,"Suicide Squeeze has got to be one of the better indie labels out there today. This comp pretty much sums up all they've been through, and there are plenty of essential tracks on here any music fan can appreciate. Check out the Iron & Wine track (Sam Beam), which seems to be missing from their recent big fat b-sides collection. And also be sure to check out 764-HERO (a song from their 7 inch now dreadfully out of print) and Red Stars Theory (with an ambient song that should've been on their last album), my personal faves. Other awesome standouts include Pedro The Lion, These Arms Are Snakes, Of Montreal, and Russian Circles. I think this comp is a limited edition of 5000, so get yours while you still can! A nice way to sample my kind of music!"
2,Limited ideas,"While the quilling is unique, there are only a couple of new patterns to use from this book."
5,"Great product, easy to use, highly recommended!!","I was looking for a quality, but not to expensive CD player at the store. I saw this and was amazed! The buttons are greatly laid out, and it is super easy to use. Just press play and you're in business! Displays the title, author, and album of any MP3 CD. The person that said this is a fiasco forgot a minor detail, (more like major), finalizing the CD! This has always worked for me and always will!"
2,Mine Stopped Reading CD's After About A Year And A Half,"After trying various fixes, new batteries, new CD, CD cleaner, I've come to the conclusion that my CD player is dead. I'm assuming it's the drive mechanism or the motor since it no longer makes a spin up sound or vibration.Other than that this was an okay CD player. The volume was a little lower than other CD players I've had, making it hard to hear on the noisier parts of my daily train ride. I also thought the MP3 display / controls were a little difficult to use, but I've been spoiled by my computer's MP3 player I suppose."
2,"Not worth your $, unless you are really poor","The only good thing about this cd player is that it is really cheap. But otherwise, it is not BAD in particular, it is just not good. It takes a long time to read the cds, it uses up batteries quickly, there is a quiet hissing in the background when it plays, it won't hold your spot in a cd if you stop it, etc. Also, I have a tape adapter for my car stereo, and my old Sony player worked great with it; however, this thing sounds really weird in the car. Basically, this is a cheap cd player that gets the basic job done, but your money will definitely be more well-spent on a Sony or another leading brand."
2,Don't buy a Memorex,This product was great when i first got it. It barey ever skipped and the search function was excellent. I am only rating it 2 stars becasue after a few months the thing just started going through battery's. I kept buying new batterys and it kept draining them in 10 minutes. Don't buy this CD player whatever you do.
1,Not the best sound,"I bought this item when it was on sale. I didn't have real high expectations so I wasn't surprised. The MP3 sound quality is very good, but the standard CD sound lacks. There is some audible clipping. When I compare with a CD player I bought a couple of years ago ..., the cheaper player sounds better. Again though the MP3 sounds good so if that is your main purpose, then it is a good buy."
1,AWFUL! Broke after a week.,"I bought this off Amazon brand new, and after 1 week, when I put a disc in, nothing would happen when I pushed play or anything. I put brand new batteries in and still, nothing.DO NOT BUY THIS JUST FOR THE PRICE! SPEND $20 MORE DOLLARS AND BUY A CD PLAYER THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!"
4,Not bad at all,Quite a few photos and does a good job of providing the basic info about the breed and how to show it.
4,A Super-Charged Read,"Supercharged Sales is a high-octane read. Fast, fun, and smart it entertainingly does something too few books do: it uses universal truths and clear thinking to help everyday situations make sense. And, Barnes' message stays with you long after you've put the book down. The author's passion for living a better work--and personal--life is clear, honest, and infectious. Whether you're in it for business tips or you're a go-getter for a better life, a high performance read awaits. Fuel up, Supercharged Sales is a fun ride.--Mark Clement is the author of THE CARPENTER'S NOTEBOOK"
1,Wrong Artist!,"After hearing ""La Pantera Mambo"" by La 33 and buying their first CD for that track and loving the whole of the album, then finding a 'new' CD by a group of that name, I was delighted. Not so delighted was I to find that THIS La 33 is a different group entirely, and, worse, the ENTIRE CD is comprised of Cumbias. Fine if you like Cumbia, but I generally do not! If you are seeking a Mambo sound, go somewhere else!!"
5,How can I convince you to read this book?,"The text itself is medicinal. The story speaks often of the ancient and rare, but is something everyone struck by the unrelenting madness of the modern world should read. The author's sincerity comes through clearly, and I would be pleased to see more from him. It is difficult to do justice to this book in a short time; it is very rich, even poetic. Do yourself a favor: just trust me on this one."
4,Good Disc but..........,"I purchased these rewritable disc and Sony is a good brand. They do the job but if your CDRW drive is a Toshiba or possibily another famous brand name drive it may not write or format the disc. This happened to one of my labtops that had a Toshiba drive. The message I got was ""disc is right protected"". I contacted DELL tech support and they recommend I use other brand names for my burning. I guess there was a conflict with rival brand names. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for this issue. I guess some CDRW drives may have a generic name and accepts any brand disc. Just my opinion and thoughts."
4,Good Sound,"One disc didn't work, but the others were perfect. Hopefully I'll learn how to rewrite on them so I can reuse some of them. If I can't do that then they're too expensive."
5,Great value and quick shipping,Like my heading states great value for the money and quick shipping. I would do more business with this vendor.
2,A Strange Little Book,"Although the illustrations are well done and some printed on tissue, the lack of non-biographical text makes the book a mystery. For much of the book, partial views of paintings are presented without any discussion; the subtitle ""Line and Transparency"" is never explained. This makes me wonder if the book was intended as the backup for a lecture."
2,Disappointed,"Buyer beware: these are discontinued. Seller will send you a pair that looks entirely different than what is shown in the photo (as of circa January, 2011). Hopefully changes will be made to ensure customers get exactly what they see advertised. I wasn't fortunate enough to have this experience. Despite receiving the wrong color and style, I noticed they seem like they're made from quality material which is why I bumped the item score from one to two stars."
5,Gloves just what I had hoped for,The gloves purchased were just exactly what I was looking for. It's good to know that I can purchase another pair in the future.Training Gloves Nylon Back (PR)
3,Not as good as Maynards,"I enjoyed these wine gums, but I prefer the Maynards brand. The Norfolk Manor wine gums taste more like fruit-snacks both in their consistency (more soft and less chewy than Maynards) and in terms of their taste (flavor is more fruity and less winey, compared to Maynards).I will stick with Maynards."
2,"Alright, but you can buy better.","The texture of these wine gums is okay, chewy like good wine gums ought to be. Unfortunately, the flavor of these wine gums really fall short. While the box claims ""natural and artificial flavors,"" all I could taste was the artificial flavorings, and weak ones at that! At one point all the flavors seem to taste the same - just sweet but bland.While these are cheap, you do get just what you pay for. I'd say go for the Gustaf's wine gums instead, or just go ahead and splurge on Maynard's or Bassett's."
3,Not as good as Gustafs or Maynards,I would rate these as acceptable but we preferred Maynards over Gustafs and Gustafs over these. These are gluten free. I wonder if gluten makes the difference.
1,I give up!!!,I was supposed to get 12 boxes of wine gums but only received 1. I sent an e- mail to Amazon and they said that they would replace the order. 3 days later I received another single box of candy. I called on the phone next and spoke to a customer service representative who assured me that all 12 packs were in the single 8 ounce box. I finally gave up and ordered my wine gums from E bay. The candy was fine but I never received the full order. I am happy to say that this the only problem that I have ever had with Amazon.
1,"Major Flaw, watch out !!","The ""touch"" sensitive call button on this phone goes off ALL the time. Its impossible to fiddle with your phone, especially when you are scrolling through your contacts and not touch the call button accidentally. I have mistakenly called various persons in my contact list with out wanting to. Very, Very, Very, annoying especially when you end up calling someone you are not intimate with. This is a MAJOR flaw and makes this phone WORTHLESS regardless of its many other features !!! Do not buy, you will regret it!!"
2,ehhhh...,"Okay, Mr. Pike is a great author and has a pure talent at writing and deserves king of YA horror. This book was really good but when the 'twist' came, ehhhhh... can anyone say STUPID!"
2,"I'm not stupid, but... HUH??","This was probably the worst of C. Pike's works, and one of the very few that aren't too well-written. I couldn't understand what the hell was going on with the future and all, but it was one slip-up that will never happen again. Mr. Pike generally deals with realistic murders and all, but this was just silly."
3,IT WAS ALLRIGHT,"I STARTED OUT READING PIKE BOOKS LIKE DIE SOFTLY AND CHAIN LETTER AND I LOVED THEM. NOW IM READING BOOKS LIKE THIS AND THEY'RE GOOD AND EVERYTHING BUT A LITTLE TOO SCIENCE FICTIONY FOR ME. WHEN I STARTED READING IT I WAS THINKING HOW GREAT IT WAS GETTING. THEN HE STARTED WITH ROBOTS AND JUNK AND I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP AWAKE AT THOSE PARTS. I LIKE THE BOOKS MAIN IDEA BUT I THINK HE GOT A LITTLE TOO DEEP INTO THE ROBOT SUBJECT. IF YOU WANT A GREAT PIKE BOOK, READ REMEMBER ME OR FINAL FRIENDS!!!"
5,A must for Pike fans,Christopher Pike has done it again! He has achieved a wonderfulblend of three dimensional characters with an original and captivatingstoryline. I appreciate how he gave the characters such depth. The phych of the novel gets to you and pulls you in. The ending is extremely satisfying and fitting for the novel. A must for Pike fans.
3,good solid job.,"I'm a compulsive reader of ride guides, and I find this one perfectly satisfactory. Route choices are well-chosen. Directions and maps are solid. The rides are ranked by difficulty, and the standards are high--when it says a ride is hard, it is. Drawbacks: no elevation totals or elevation profiles; only 40 rides total; almost all the rides fall in a wide east-west band from SF Bay to Tahoe. One bonus: ""Northern California"" is defined broadly, so you get a few rides as far south as Morro Bay! One hideous gaff: the ride in my home town, the Chico to Davis Challenge, has you riding the route backwards--if you do, you'll kill first yourself, then the author."
5,Great tool for kids,"Wanda Belch is the new cafeteria lady at school. Rumor has it that kids found shoes in her food at her old job and that she now drives a garbage truck. But the kids at her new job soon find out that lunch and their new cafeteria lady aren't as scary as they thought.This is a great book that not only teaches kids how untrue rumors can be and how silly some fears can be, but also that appearances are deceiving. It does NOT, as a previous person mentioned, deride or make a mockery of the food service industry. It actually shows kids that their cafeteria workers are not evil, but honest and hard-working people. Anyone who thinks differently of this book has obviously NOT read it.This is a great book and I highly recommend it."
1,Story line is offensive and inappropriate for small children,"I fail to see the humor in the author's thesis. The representation of school lunch as ""garbage"" is not only unfitting and inappropriate, it is inaccurate.School foodservice programs throughout the country are not only customer oriented and cost effective, they provide the main source of nutrition to over 25 million of our nation's school children, most of whom live at or below the poverty level. To use this subject matter as a means of humor is not just offensive. It is without merit or basis of fact."
2,you get what you pay for,"I trim the trees at the side of my house once every 3-4 years. I went online shopping for a hedge trimmer and found this to be the cheapest. I trusted Amazon.com's decision in putting this product among its merchandize even though it is being sold by another vendor. I received it on time, immediate put it to work and noticed that I need to stop trimming every 5 minutes because the blades which are rubbing the plastic casing causes the plastic to start melting. It is cheap because it is built cheap but it does the job as long as you give it time to cool down every 5 minutes."
4,"Nice Hedger, hope it lasts","This hedger is straight from China, it looks cheap, even the plastic is cheap looking, not solid like other brands. It does work really well however! It seems to be powerful enough and 22 inches is a nice size. The handle, as mentioned in other posts, seems really cheap, just don't overtighten the two supplied cap screws and perhaps it won't break. I got this at a really low price and it was worth it so my advice would be if it is really on sale then go for it, otherwise I would buy something with a little more quality."
2,American Gardener Hedge Trimmer Review,"It worked well until the handle broke off - same as everyone else reported. It would be fine if they would replace it, but that's another story."
2,Last American Virgin,The movie was great except that you cannot finish it. When it gets to the end the VERY end the movie skips. I tried cleaning off and it still skips.
5,Summer Classic,"The good life. High School. Three friends, one unforgetable year. I learned a lot from this movie...most intersting that the best gift for a girl recovering from an abortion is some oranges and a Christmas Tree. Who could forget Victor's convertable surviving the leap off the cliff, riding right into the ocean in broad daylight with the passion melting from Gary and Rose's lips. Or how about Karin and Rick's love affair in the stadium. Ohhh, Karen looks goood. If Ruby the hooker is reading this please call me; Im fatter than David and hornier than Carmela.Along with a great soundtrack, anyone would put this on their best of all time list. It's worth every penny, even though my friends and I paid 75 cents for it at a movie shop in Ridgeway. It has a great soundtrack too. Please buy this, I have a date with Carmella."
2,Typical Cheeseball 80's flick,"Watching this movie when I was a kid was great since I got to see naked girls which was a novelty for me then however, other then that these 80's flicks fail to amuse me even to this day due to their badly written story lines, unbelievable acting, and the most cheezy chliche diologue you'll never want to hear again. No wonder these actors never worked again.I saw another reviewer compliment the musical scores in this movie which I thought was a joke since this movie force fed us with every awfull 80's rock ballad and new wave trash. This movie also makes me feel thankfull that the 80's are over since im spared of seeing the badly mismatched color clothing, the awfull hair spray hair styles, and the uncoordinated pogo stick dancing (damn thats awfull). The only relevance this movie had was pointing out how easy it was to get laid back then which is the only thing I'll miss about the 80's other wise good ridance."
4,The Last American Virgin,"This movie tops all of the teen movies of today. I don't understand why they have not released it on dvd. They are selling it on VHS for some outrageous prices. The soundtrack is great too, if you are a fan of the 80's. Hopefully they will release it soon and everyone will get to see the humor of Gary and his friends go on a fun time in the pizza mobile to see Carmella!"
3,Somethings missing,"I recieved me copy of the DVD today,and I immediatly proceded to watch it,mind you I have a copy I dubbed several years ago from a rental.I also have a new sealed VHS copy. I love this movie!! Like so many other fans of this movie it just brings back great memories.So let me get to the point.THE SOUNDTRACK HAS BEEN ALTERED!They deleated ""Love Action"" by The Human League and put in for the second time in the soundtrack ""whip it"", why would they do such a thing to an otherwise great soundtrack i'll never know,I guess i'm just a freak. I know my wife won't notice it.And if you've never seen it shame on you."
4,Do nice guys always finish last?,"Nice guy Gary (Lawrence Monoson) is having trouble getting the attention of the pretty new girl in school (Diane Franklin). Trouble is, she likes his studly friend Rick (Steve Antin), who basically treats her like dirt. Story basically follows Gary and Rick and tubby friend David (Joe Rubbo) on their sexual misadventures, which basically gets them nowhere quick. Despite all the sexual innuendo and cruelty in the story, Gary's teenage angst will surely bring back memories for many male viewers. Great early '80's soundtrack. In light of ""Porky's"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and all the other teen genre films of the early '80's this is an overlooked item, but a good one. Good cast and believeable acting increase the appeal here."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"This is one of my all time favorite classics. I recall watching this movie when it came out on cable while visiting some relatives. The ending was cruel but I identified with it so much. Nice guys do finish last and this is a painstaking reality. I was on the end of a lot of relationships as the person ""who got the shaft"" so to speak. It brought back a lot of bittersweet memories. The soundtrack is to die for. I even ordered one for my son just for the leason learned value in the movie itself."
4,Reality in a Hollywood movie?,The ending made this movie. Its not often that you can say a Hollywood movie reflects real life so spot on. This movie sums up the poor decision makeing (men and women) that is rampent when love is involved. It's no wonder 50% of all marriges end in devorce. Smoke and mirrors and refuseing to see the facts
3,coming of age movie,"OK movie. It is dated somewhat. Shows the coming of age movie, But there are better ones out there IE. valley girls, fast times, etc.)"
3,Where is the original?,"The Last American Virgin was a remake of Lemon Popcicle, the first of a whole Israeli series of films. Where The Last American Virgin was set in the America of the 80's, the original films were set in Israel, in the 1950's. The only way to see this films were dubbed. The first few of the series were quite watchable and now in the time of dvd, I can't wait for the films to come out in thjeir original language and original aspect ratio."
3,***,"It's a very clumsy film. And what I loved about it, I hated about it. I saw this in high school, and Gary was me in high school. I was the shy, nice guy who the hot girls would call ""sweet"" when they weren't busy sexually gratifying my more aggressive buddies. Very wounding. This film cut VERY close to the bone (no pun intended, exactly. Oh, and the two girls who in particular treated me that way I saw recently, and they've both gone to seed. Sometimes justice is served.) I wish the same story could have been delivered in a better made film. But it's definitely a film a lot of people can relate to, and because of that, has some worth."
4,Useful reference for publishers,"My copy of the Deadly Directory is well worn, having been used countless times in my job as a book publicist. The section on reviewers is wonderfully helpful, giving you new contact names of freelancers that you may not reach by just sending to a newspaper. As with any directory though, it is important to follow up and confirm addresses before sending; many contact names and addresses chnge on a regular basis. Overall, highly useful and recommended resource."
2,nothing wrong with the product itself but,Im a lefty and the location of the knob rubs against the palm of my hand and alters the air adjustment as Im spraying. Just my opinion....but a heads up to the lefty's who might be considering a purchase
2,Upping the Ante and Losing My Interest,"I was invested in Abramm for the first two books, but this one just seems to go too far. The stakes were raised way too high and the evil is cranked up so high, so fast, that my suspension of disbelief was shattered.I'm waving good bye to this series."
2,too much evil,"I really enjoyed books one and two (the first book, ""The Light of Eidon"", was free), but the third and fourth books are just one evil after another after another after another. The writing style and the writing itself is excellent, if you can put up with everything going wrong and very little good sprinkled in here and there. I struggled through the third book but had hopes the fourth book would be more about the triumph of good based on it's title ""The Return of the Guardian-King"". But after 20 chapters I'm giving up. It's one triumph of evil after another after another. Good literature has to have conflicts to resolve, but this is waaaay overboard."
4,Personal e book review,I am really enjoying the Legend of the Guardian series - Shadow over Kiriath is another winner! Karen Hancock the author has a unique view of good v evil! Looking forward to Book 4
5,Shadow Over Kiriath,"Shadow Over Kiriath by Karen HancockShadow Over Kiriath (Legends of the Guardian-King, Book 3)Another excellent book from Ms. Hancock. Her telling of each characters journey to Eidon is well told and suspenseful. She does it so well that with each scene you go into it wondering if this will be the time when the character forsakes it all and gives into evil. It is not a foregone conclusion that they will chose the right path and the reader sits there and prays that the character will.Ms. Hancock has skillfully crafted the scenes so that the reader knows exactly what the character is feeling and they want to turn the page to see how they stack up to the character.An excellent read with lots of lessons for the reader.Be sure and have book four close by when finishing book three because you will want to start reading it right away.God Bless,Chris Weigand[...]."
3,Not as good as books 1 and 2,"I was not as happy with Book 3 as I had been with Books 1 and 2. I was most disappointed with the introduction of Hazmul. This is when I felt like the plot became a bit cheap and average. The way that group of evil-doers operated as an agency seemed too silly and like something straight out of Men in Black. The writer could have done a much better job of introducing this evil. Besides that, the rest of the book was fine and I still wanted to finish the series."
1,ugh...,"I really enjoyed the first two books and the majority of this third book. Then I read the end. Sickening. I know that books don't have to have ""happily ever after"" endings, and that the story finishes in the fourth book. However, this ending made my stomach turn and left me feeling depressed and very uncomfortable. I read books for enjoyment and escape. Not to read about (SPOILER COMING) rape and the murder of an infant. If I wanted to read about that, I would read the newspaper. I was shocked to find this in a Christian novel. I will not read the last book of the series, nor anything else by this author. I am surprised by all of the rave reviews of this book. That saddens me."
3,It's Andy Williams...,"...but the second disk contains nothing but live recordings. I love Andy Williams' voice and delivery but I have never much cared for live recordings with all the audience noise, so I gave it three rather than five stars."
5,CHEERFUL TEA TOWELS,"THESE TEA TOWELS ARE CHEERFUL AND BRIGHT. THEY GET SOFTER AND MORE ABSORBENT WITH EACH WASHING. I LIKE OPENING MY DRAWER AND SEEING THEM THERE, SO PRETTY THEY MAKE SOMETHING AS MUNDANE AS DRYING A DISH PLEASURABLE. MY OLD ONES WERE OOOOLLD, SO IM VERY GLAD I FOUND THESE TO REPLACE THEM."
4,Good for the price,"$129 at Lowes...$89 delivery fee box or put together..$129 Amazon, With Prime $3.99 Overnight delivery, no tax. 45 minute assembly according to instructions, yeah by a guy that works at the factory for the last 20 years assembling these things; more like 3 hours plus. Bad instructions. Grill quality is fine though...even heating, nice to have a burner on the left as I'm left handed...cusomized it. Works great. For the price it's a good grill."
1,Worst Grill Ever,"What a piece of garbage. The instructions are the absolute worst I've ever seen in my life. The pieces are cheaply made. One piece broke while attempting to follow the confusing assembly instructions. Needless to say, we went with another brand. Do not buy Charbroil!"
1,Piece of Junk! (hundreds of pieces of junk),"What a joke. I wish I had never purchased this box of cheap stamped parts. And it's a nightmare to try to bring them together into a product.They sold me an incomplete product, and basically, I am putting it together from scratch. Saves them a lot of money, I'm sure.But my time is worth money too. By the time this grill is put together, the final cost is: $360.First, the initial cost- $120. Now add in two guys and 4 hrs of labor apiece. That's 8 man hours, at say, $30 an hour (less than what I would make working on the weekend, but hey), that's $240. So, I've got a piece of junk grill that frustrated the heck out of us during assembly, and it only cost $360. Great bargain. Stay far far away from Charbroil. I'm so mad I could toss the thing into the alley behind the house."
1,Warning from california prop 65,Why in this day and age do we sell items containing lead for cooking food? Wish I saw Char broils manual before I purchased this grill. Made in china. Poor quality stamped metals. Grill stored in protected site when not in use and already show signs of rust in less than 6 months when only used twice. Side burner flame is too far away from pan bottom to be effective--worst design I have seen yet on any grill I have owned. Last char broil product I will purchase!
2,What a piece of junk!,"Let's cut to the chase...pick a different grille, I sure wish I had. Assembly was a nightmare, with instructions that were confusing, erratic and in some cases just plain WRONG. Now that the grille is finally together, it works well enough, but after only two weeks the finish imperfections on the top lid are starting to RUST! That's right, folks, it's not even aluminum. What a dumb choice for a product made to be left outdoors. CharBroil should be ashamed for putting their name on this product. If I could return it, I would...but how do you return an assembled grille?"
4,"It is, what it is!","An inexpensive grill! I bought mine from a local department store for around $100 and it lasted me for a couple years until I could get a place where I could buy a larger, more powerful grill. It never had any problem when trying to fire it up and and always cooked my food evenly. I did have some flare ups but that only added a little more flavor. I never had any issue w/ it rusting and I kept it outside all year around w/out a cover. As long as I kept it clean on the inside and there were no strong winds, my flare ups were kept to a minimum. All and all, I was happy with this grill. For the people that say it was hard to put together, I agree...it took a little longer then we thought but we ended up putting it together in about 3 hours which isn't bad."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have had this grill for almost exactly two years.I've had to replace the left burner after 1.5 years. The inside does not drain fat well and it will catch fire.And just recently 12"" flames started to shoot out of the front of it from underneath. This melted my control knobs as well as all of the lettering on the front. I called their ""customer service"" and the problem was blamed on spiders...There is a serious design flaw with this grill and it creates an extreme fire hazard with the propane tank being stored inches away from the fault.I will never buy this brand again, and now need to purchase a new grill."
5,Bang for your buck,"For what your gonna pay this is a great grill. This will be summer #3 and it is still cooking up a storm. I used it all through the winters, and it still works great. The handle has loosened and some of the paint is peeling but for the price what a steal. I live in an apartment house and refuse to buy an expensive grill for others to steal or ruin. I'm very happy with this cheaply grill"
2,Fun glasses but they crack,"I love spongebob and these glasses are a lot of fun, but within one week one glass cracked from top to bottom and had to be discarded. The second week a second glass developed a crack at the top. Fun, but they are not going to last long..."
2,Installation is a nightmare,"Installing this device is a giant challenge. I purchased this scanner for my wife for Christmas. After she opened it we immediately hooked it up to our Dell computer which is running Window's ME. We followed the direction for installation and the driver kept hanging the computer. After 5 attempts I installed the scanner via my own method, which eventually worked. After the installation the scanner appears to work as advertised."
1,Epson 1650 Photo,"The ability of this scanner to produce a full scan of its bed is very poor. I have been used to an old Astra 1220U, which was able to provide a scan with very little shadow at the edges of the scanned area. My attempts with similar original images on the 1650 were extremely disappointing. I was left with about 4 picas of shadow all around the final image. The Techies told me that it couldn't be adjusted. Also, when scanning my illustrations in ""illustration"" mode, the results were dismal. The techies told me to set it in ""Color Photo"". Go figure...I didn't try the neg scanner, so I can't comment on that. I returned the unit the day after it was delivered."
4,Almost there,"This is not a bad scanner at all. The quality of the scans is good (although I have seen better). I had no problem setting the scanner up to my laptop running win2000. Like the other reviewers, some of the photo scans are crocked even when the images were lined up correctly. Also, the color of the scans tends to be on the magenta side. I easily corrected it with Photoshop. The ArcSoft software that came with the scanner is poor. Running the scanner via Photoshop Elements is ideal. No problems so far. I spent five hours the day that I got the scanner and scanned at least two dozen pictures and half a dozen slides."
2,Top quality scan--Inflexible software,"If you want a scanner to copy photographs with high quality, this is the one. If you want to use the copy utility to make a copy to print, it takes 1 minute 30 seconds. It automatically defaults to color which is slow. Defaults are impossible to change. Copy to Email only works with Office XP or Outlook Express but will not work with Outlook 2000. The inability to change defaults makes the software cumbersome. Try to find the Email support site, it is there but hidden and then the responses are canned because the support person didn't read the real problem. Just read comments about the HP scanners and they apparently have the same problems. They are making scanners for idiots, not thinking customers."
4,Works great with xp,"This is one scanner that will work with xp, me, 98..Works great, I had no problem installing it. Just make sure you install the driver BEFORE you plug the scanner into your computer. The included software isn't the greatest, that's why I only gave it a 4.. But I already have Microsoft picture it installed and that works a little better than some of the Epson's included software. I have a HP printer and it works fine with that. (I am using winXP drivers for the printer though.)It is very nice scanner. But is noisy compared to the HP I had, but hey this works with XP and the HP wouldn't, so I'm happy."
1,Missing CD. Bad support.,"Instead of the CD with the required drivers, I received the scanner with two copies of the Adobe software, i.e. I had no way to get the scanner working without going to download files. Epson tech support is bad, burried deep in their website is a location to electronically submit problems. When I said that the software was missing, the response was that I should call their long distance tech support number to get one shipped. Rather than wait forever on a long distance number, I decided to ship it back. They don't seem to have much focus on customer support so I'd rather not own the product."
1,Faulty Scanner,"The Epson 1650 yielded satisfactory results while it lasted. However, it recently began making noise like gears being stripped and promptly gave up the ghost. I've been wondering how far I could throw the thing. I'll try H.P. next time."
1,Needs a better description,"Please be aware of the Standard flat plate size of these weights does not fit a 2"" bar. Very bad return policy."
5,Solid and practical,"This extremely practical handbook discusses the basics of disciple making and gives tools that may aid a discipler in her work. Adsit looks at the different levels of spiritual maturity: babies, children, adolescents and adults. He then seeks to prescribe which kinds of spiritual food each might need. This book has many charts and outlines that could be taken and used directly in a discipleship relationship. Adsit comes from a Campus Crusade background, and advances the Ten Basic Steps as suitable tools for training.The book doesn't deal with some of the more advanced areas of coaching and counseling, but is a good, solid read.- Dennis McCallum author,Organic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"
5,"Fun read, useful for training",I read this book for a college class requirement and am now working through the 12 steps in discipleship as outlined with a friend. This book is enjoyable to read and useful in implementing a discipleship plan. The author weaves fun humor and real life experiences into the pages. It is full of Scripture and insight.
5,Describes all of the various aspects of the ceremony,"The collaborative effort of Virlana Tkacz, Sayan Zhambalov, and Wanda Phipps, and filled with a wealth of 175 gorgeous, full color photographs, Shanar: Dedication Ritual Of A Buryat Shaman In Siberia accurately depicts the dedication rituals, rites, and ceremony of a Buryat Shaman in Siberia. The informed and informative text describes all of the various aspects of the ceremony in wondrous, heartfelt, and painstaking detail, which combine to fully capture and present the this sacred rite with all respect and an appreciative humility. Shanar is a very highly recommended contribution to Comparative Religion and Anthropology reference collections and supplemental reading lists."
5,From Novice to Expert in One Easy Step,"Ok, so that's a bit extreme; but I've been surprised at the breadth and depth of information in this book. It's surprisingly readable. How often could you say you've read page after page about wool socks and long underwear without falling asleep?"
4,Learning English can be fun!,"I am an English teacher and I use this book to help my students learn English culture through expressions, vocabulary and idioms. However, I would not suggest this book to anyone who is not already at an advanced or intermediate/advanced level, because many of the words and expressions are very abstract, and as a teacher, my slower, weaker and not so advanced students would find it very difficult, and also not get the humor. And if your students cannot understand the humor then the whole book's purpose does not work! ALSO, it is a bit dated, after all it was published in 1992, but the cartoons are still really funny."
5,Every Massage,"Don't do a massage without one. Small places, large places, whole back, whole legs. It's great. you will have continued happy cusotmers"
4,"Fit good, work good, priced good.","Fit good, work good, priced good. Put on a 1997 Lexus ES300.Was bottoming out running over dips in road. NO more."
5,South Carolina History,"This is a great book and even though it was a used edition, It was like new.This book is out of print and I was glad to find a copy."
4,Wolf to the Slaughter,I like all of Ruth Rendell books that is written with Inspector Wexford as the main character.Her books are the first I order.
5,Excellent mystery,"Ruth Rendell is in top form as usual. She's such an excellent mystery writer, both she and P.D. James are top notch."
2,Wish I had realized this was a reprint of an old book,"When Amazon sent me the notice that this book was coming out in September, I assumed it was a new book and so ordered it, as Rendell is one of my favorite mystery authors (prefer her books under the pseudonym Barbara Vine but like the Rendell books, too). Imagine my chagrin to realize it was just a reprint of a 1967 book, which I had read years ago. I will now check every time Amazon suggests a book to me to make sure that it is a current book and not just an old one with a new cover. In other words, a big waste of my money (but no reflection on Rendell, rather on Amazon)."
2,disappointed,It was not stated that this was a reprint of a very old Inspector Wexford mystery by Ruth Rendell. I don't think I would have bought it had I known. I read it anyway---but I would have liked to have known the facts before hand.
5,Fantastic imaginative ambient music.,"This soundtrack is indeed amazing. Definitely on par with the soundtrack to Akira. Being an avid collector of soundtracks this is one of my favourites. It has touches of Akria as well as Bladerunner and The Crow.Music switches from the rhythmic beating of drums to acoustic guitar, Japanese chorals, bells, synthesisers and other ambient sounds. Watch the movie. Then listen to the soundtrack. Then watch the movie again. You will see how perfectly the music compliments and enhances the viewing.My only critique of the movie is the Jap Pop track at the very end. For fans of the Japanese Pop scene this will probably be appreciated however I found it annoying.Still gets ***** out of ***** though. If you are lucky enough to be able to find this CD anywhere - buy it. It may be expensive but it is well, well worth it."
5,Haunting and beautiful.,"Being a big fan of most japanese animation, I'm always interested to hear the soundtracks out of the context of the film. When you're just listening to the music without the action on screen, soundtracks sometimes change...I have found that this is not the case with Ghost In the Shell. In fact, I enjoy the music ever more! I should also mention that I am very interested in traditional instrumentation; Ghost In The Shell is an excercise in the seamless melding excellent folk instrumentation with synthesized, computer generated instrumentation. It is both haunting and beautiful...and worth every penny!"
4,PRICING,"this is an excellent ost. however the prices for this that I have seen are much to high. A company in California sells this cd import for 18.00 dollars, and shiping is a couple of bucks."
4,Just a little to little,"This soundtrack is great. The mood from the anime is everpresent and it goes perfectly with my prefered method of listening to music (while making my homework:). I must say thougt that i don't think it will apeal to everyone. The chorus in tracks 1, 5 and 10 is perhaps to much for some people. Also the bonus track seems a bit out of context. And its a bit short and expensive. Other than that it is quite good (understatement)."
2,Not very melodic,"Mostly sparse, textural, and repetitive in the sense that some of the tracks sound like the same track in varying states of completion. It's just BARELY ambient, actually, creating unmarked atmosphere - not really contributing to any particular kind of feeling.For me, the three most outstanding tracks were:1. M01 I - Making of Cyborg (the creepy, minimalist Japanese chant that opens the movie- still melodic)4. M04 Virtual Crime (My favorite - I even heard Garth Trinidad spin it on Chocolate City one night [KCRW L.A.])11. See You Everyday (A hypermelodic, upbeat Chinese pop song sung in Chinese by Fang Ka Wing)I would not recommend paying full price for this. Consider that I bought it at a Japanese bookstore downtown in 1998 for f1ft5en b*cks. Having ripped Virtual Crime to mp3 and buried this CD long ago, I only looked it up again for See You Everyday because to this day, the melody has stayed with me."
4,Great sound/performance,"I bought this exhaust system, not from Amazon, but from Ebay. It was definately worth the price tag. I have a pretty heavy box in my trunk holding an amp, and two 10"" Rockford Fosgate Subs. My car felt heavier and lost some of its ""umph"". After i installed this Borla Exhaust, my car sounded alot better with a deeper tone, and it felt like i had my horsepower back that i lost from the weight. If your looking for a deep clean sound, this is the exhaust for your tiburon, hands down! The installation was also a piece of cake. Im not very tool worthy at all, but all this thing requires is knowing how to put on a few clamps, and your done. Add this to your cart now, and search no more! You wont find better"
1,Speedy service for cheap DVD's,"I live in Australia so was pleasantly surprised that the DVD arrived within a couple of weeks. The problem was I could not watch it because it is programmed for another country and my DVD player will not accept the code. So here I am with this purchase for which the postage was 2 - 3 times the cost of the product and it is useless to me... I was so looking forward to watching it!Before I ordered this product, I would like to have have known that the DVD is programmed for use in a different country. Luckily the book I ordered is in English and I will be able to read it."
2,"ugh, what drivel","I'm a big Mann fan, and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films, thunder bay for instance. a great director, but this one stinks. i can't even get up the enthusiasm to criticise it"
4,They don't make movies like this anymore!,"Review are you kidding, they just don't make movies like this anymore. Two plots going on at the same time the main being a treasure hunt which causes men to test what their true treasure is and the love story which for its time was almost scandelous. This is a good old fashhion movie. Did I say good. I mean great."
4,Southern Charm & Smarm,"This is a great, comedic and yet, at times, dramatic film. Southern trashy family, religious overtones, steamy sexuality, ignorant superstition... so many themes all blended together to make an interesting film. Tina Louise in an early sexpot role simply adds to the soup. Watch this film!"
4,WHAT AN ACRE,"Here's a movie that I'd not expected. Robert Ryan, Vic Morrow, Michael Landon, Jack Lord, Buddy Hackett, and Tina Louise really set the screen on fire. A good surprise for me."
1,Crap,"I ordered this stool and the first day I got it, the stool broke. The legs are put on with pressed sawdust. The company sent me a replacement and told me to keep the first one. The other one lasted longer, but still had the same problem and it is just pressed sawdust holding up the seat with 1 bracer bar. Cheap, CHeap, Cheap."
1,Bad product,This product arrived damagedThe replacement came and when we put the legs on they split while being screwed inI read past reviews and ignored them when I boughtThis. Apparently I was wrongWe just threw it in the trash
3,You get what you pay for..,"For the price, this is a nice stool. It was very easy to put together. Quality OK, one leg was a little crooked, so won't be able to bear any weight.I have it at the foot of my bed so the doggies can jump on up to the bed.Upholstery seems good, and well attached. Overall pleased with it. Shipping was reasonable.Don't expect long lasting, heirloom quality- but you won't have to feel bad if it breaks soon."
1,Badly made,"The stool looked beautiful after we put it together. However, not much later my parents-in-law came to visit. My mother-in-law sat in the stool to put on some makeup in my vanity, and it broke! She is only about 110 pounds! Thankfully she didn't get hurt. We tried fixing it but the other legs broke twice in subsequent times. Threw it out and had to buy another stool. Don't buy it, badly made."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!,JUNK!!!!!! pretty much sums it up!!!!! Cannot sit on it!!!!! BEWARE!!! It's for decor only!!!!!
3,Light and Fluffy,"I enjoyed the love story between Angela and John. I only wish it wasn't ruined by Angela's recent past and subsequent `problem.' I'm not sure that her `problem' was necessary to move the story forward - the fact that they were opposing attorneys on a family case would have been difficult enough for their budding relationship. Overall, the story was witty in places and enjoyable. Recommended."
4,Good general info,"I brought this as a companion to ""Where There is no Doctor"" for a trip to Guatemala. Althought parts are very helpful, I tended to refer to the other book for concrete help. Excellent info of family planning, breast feeding which is a must for health care workers."
1,Pretty light on practical help,"Unlike, ""Where There is no Doctor"", this book spent more time with platitudes and recommendations as to when to go see an aid worker, rather than actual procedures as to how to deal with health and injury issues. This should have been titled, ""Where Women Have No Doctor Next Door, Then They Need to Go Find One"" instead."
2,Bit of a mess,"These 3 DVD were put together without much appreciation for the content,I suppose they are better than nothing if you want to see one episode of Sugarfoot.However poor old Rifleman does not seem to have a beginning middle or an end....unless you like playing with your remote control a lot."
1,the day the earth stood stupid,"C Thomas Howell and Judd Nelson??? Was this made in 1984? What, was Gary Coleman busy? Beware Asylum movies."
2,Worst movie ever?,"This movie is horrific. It can't even be considered a ""B"" movie. That would insult all the actors who are just bad......not horrible."
1,What was the point?,"Jut to make sure nobody else has to watch the movie...In the end all the transformer like megaliths that just stand around and shoot off a couple lasers during the entire movie leave. As best as I can tell because the alien saw a baby being born.In case that wasn't enough too keep you away...Stupid movie, terrible acting, unrealistic physics in the CG (although some CG actually looked decent), the plot made no sense, people made decisions that were unreasonable, the science was not reasonable. Multiple EMPs wipe everything out in the entire world - shows globe with all lights going off, even in north america where it is supposed to be daytime as the world will end at sundown - sundown just in new york? the megaliths are everywhere...alien chick gets a car started for dude, they get car jacked because it is the only working car, then a cop drives by in the background and soon after someone is calling on a cell phone to find their familywho writes this garbage?"
1,No way!,"I did not know people could actually make a movie SO bad. A movie like this can have such great promise, but all too often it is just filled with stupid plot lines and horrible acting.No one actually behaves as anyone really would. Like a child poking a lion while inside the cage with it.No need to get into the plot at all - just an utterly stupid movie, doesn't even merit a review of the bad parts - it is all bad."
1,Laughable and low grade B movie,"I was expecting ""the day the earth stood still"". Instead we got... something less. I kept waiting for something to happen, but alas, it remained consistently boring throughout.I'm sure I've piqued your interest with that intro and you're wondering what you can expect if you decide to watch it, right?Well, for starters you'll get a very poor sound track and musical score, uninspired dialog and zombie-like acting, one tarted-up and naked woman, lots of editing mistakes, disappointment that the large robots never really do anything, and the knowledge that you'll never get the 2 hours of your life back that you wasted watching the movie.So if that ""endorsement"" has got you all lathered up and ready to watch, by all means get yourself down to the video store or order this thing up from Amazon right now. You may not respect yourself in the morning, but if you watch it in private you don't have to tell anyone what you did."
1,Asylum must be stopped from making movies...,Not even worth a review. This company is putting out movies as fast as the goodone comes out...everything they do is crappy...their actors..their cgi .They are just there to make a buck of us the suckers...suckers cause they havegreat dvd covers...and we might just think...one day they'll have a good movie include in them....Not !!
5,In a class by itself.,"The only book that shows you how to create luxurious Colefax & Fowler interiors in miniature. 'The Yellow Drawing Room' is a superb variant of Nancy Lancaster's famous, full-scale classic. If you like stately English houses, this book is a Must. Not a book for beginners."
3,Could have been a lot better.,"Agree with some of these other reviews. The first disc contains a short documentary with interviews of those he faced at WrestleMania and others who wanted to comment about him. I was surprised when it was over. I was expecting it to last at least 2 hours since it is on a disc and not on Tv. The other 3 disc contain the matches starting from his first match at WrestleMania against Jimmy Snuka up to his match against Triple H at WrestleMania XXVIII. Parts have been edited out of each match and they are cut short like if they don't have enough room for them on the disc. As soon as the ref counts 3, they cut to the next match or it goes to the menu. I also Agree that they should have waited until he retired from Wrestling before making this set & at least include a poster of the Man."
3,A streaking disappointment,"The matches in this DVD series were great because they were of the undertaker. The layout of the DVD's was less than stellar. They could have inserted the matches as they reviewed the streak. Without the introduction to each match, the presentation was disjointed and somewhat incoherent. With so many good matches, the layout was inexcusably disappointing."
5,Excellent,"Anything to do with The Undertaker is always a good buy & this one is no exception, WWE really know how to put a documentary or DVD together great buy would recommend anyone to buy this DVD!!!LOVE IT!!!"
5,If you love the deadman you'll love this,I find it absurd for people to say that the matches on this disc are boring except for such and such. If you want to know what matches are on this then look up the synapsis DUH. Also not every match is going to be fun for you since in the past they didnt have high flying moves. But for me I liked all the Undertakers matches since I grew up watching him. I highly recommend this DVD if your a fan of the Dead Man.
4,Hopefully not as big a disappointment as the Walmart 15-0 one,"WWE has put out a DVD of Undertaker's Streak before exclusively through Walmart but it was a huge disappointment IMO. Instead of the matches in their entirety and interviews like what was initially advertised, there were NO interviews and most of the later matches were edited to fit into 3hrs (I've seen just about every Undertaker WM match and could tell the difference) Hopefully, since the set is going to be 9hrs long, we'll get all the matches in their entirety and not the cut versions and the interviews."
3,Average at best.,"The documentary portion (on disc 1) is pretty short and hardly contains any new interviews/insights from anybody (there are a few quick tidbits from Batista, HHH, and Shawn, but that's about it). In just felt pretty cheap, more like made for TV rather than a DVD set celebrating 20+ years of The Streak. The bonus features are pretty lackluster as well, as they're just the video packages of each feud from the last few years, nothing you can't find and watch on YouTube. I mean it's great having all the matches in one place, and it'll never get old watching some of those classics (WM17, WM24, WM25, WM26 etc), but it feels that hardly any effort went into making this."
5,UNDERTAKER,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas. He is a big wrestling fan, and the Undertaker is his very favorite. ( and mine too !!) the dvd is very good, covering all 20 of his wrestlemania wins - the streak. I would recommend it to anyone who is a wrestling fan, even if the Undertaker is not their favorite."
4,Drink this in ...,"The Soul Drinkers are back in this epic fiction from BL. Counter out does himself here, and this is even better than the first in the series. Epic battles, psychological struggles, and great writing. Counter has a real touch for the grim darkness of the far future, and his fiction is great."
1,Difficult to handle,I found this product difficult to handle on my own. Another person had to help me insert it.
5,King water proofing,"I too waited for actual use before a review. Went to Skinners Falls, Sullivan County, NY this weekend. The setup was relatively easy and the storage nets that come with this tent are more useful than I thought. The best part....We were hit with torrential thunderstorms that did not let up for hours. The rain created a pool in front of this tent roughly 4 inches high (I waded into the tent), even with the mini-moat that was carved around the perimter. This tent did not leak at all! There was some perspiration higher at the seams (about 6 in high) but no leakage at all. There was water sloshing around the outside of the walls but with the nifty ""bathtup design"", it stood up like a champ. I highly recommend this tent. It is pricey but now you know why."
4,Bummer avoided,"Lesson learned; you should always set up a tent before a trip. This tent came with damaged support poles bent at a couple of the ferrels. However, the tent was able to be set up and withstood the stress of three days. It performed flawlessly. The pluses: (a) easy, intuitive set-up, (b) spacious, adjustably-ventilated interior, (c) lots of cleverly located storage ""pockets"" and (d) durable, well-constructed seams, zippers and materials. The best part of this purchase was the exchange of this tent with a new replacement at no cost to me within a week. I didn't think twice about getting another tent."
5,Great Tent,This tent has windows that actually zip up! I hate those tents that just have a screen with the fly over it. Be cautious when purchasing a tent if this matters to you. I bought one of those and returned it because there is no way you could stay warm if it got cold.This is a great one-person tent and probably fine for two. Don't even think about 4 people if you have airbeds! I have a double-high twin airbed and there was enough room to put the camping box by my bed to use as a table and a place for my clothes in the corner. I loved it. It was very cozy. I would highly recommend this.We did not have bad weather but Eureka! tents usually hold up well to the elements.
3,Not the easiest tent to put up,"It's not complicated to put up - but the reinforcd joints don't easily slide through the tent loops when you're taking it up and putting it down. It's a real pain if you're doing it on your own. If you have help, it's not too bad. Otherwise, the tent does the job. It's not a bad tent - just not the quickest assembly and break-down I've seen. I have two other tents that are much easier."
1,Warranty not adequate.,"I've had a Eureka tent for some time (20+ years) and I've used it about a dozen times. The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing has started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been ""stored indoors in the original bag"". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible.Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."
2,professional cars,I would prefer less old old hearses and more on new models and Presidential fleets and background on such.
4,Good product,"This thing couldn't be easier to use. Just hook up a hose (make sure it's a GOOD hose because it will be under pressure the whole time it's in use). An internal float switch turns off the water to the ball when it's full. As water is drank or evaporates, it refills itself. I might suggest using a quick disconnect from the hose for periodic cleaning."
2,Not quite the same as in the past,Was a bit dissapointed in this cleanser. This must be a new formula - it's not as thick and creamy as in the past. Please go back to the original formula.
2,Fairly interesting,This book would be good for someone who knows nothing about cholesterol. It goes into great length to explain the physical side. I mainly wanted to know which foods to eat or not eat and some lo-cholesterol recipes. Not there.
4,I like it,It's an easy read and very informative. I would recommend it to anyone who was concerned about their cholesterol. It is also a handy reference.
3,Good but a couple of conflicts,"This book has a lot of information and I learned some things I never knew. For one thing there are some vegetables that actually raise triglycerides...which is what I'm actually more interested in than choesterol.I did find a couple of items tht conflicted with other information I've gotten from my doctor and other readings. For one thing, it says that someone with triglycerides should use oils that have polyunsaturated fats where others have said to use monounsaturated fats. Along the same line, this book says olive oil is high in monounsaturated fats and corn oil is polyunsaturated, however, other places say olive oil is poly and corn oil is poly. A little further reasearch is necessary.Otherwise it is an easy read with a lot of information, although perhaps too much chemistry for my understanding."
4,""" Information To Comply With My Drs. Orders to Lower My Cholesterol""","I was in need of a Simple Start for Controlling my Cholesterol- In my opinion the "" Dummies Series"" in most any type ofself help needs- I find a good place to start. And once again I found that to be true to a point. Just understanding the Terminology of which Fat is the most important to Alter Quickly. This series was helpful.I would suggest it to others- who are looking for the "" Basic Starting Point""I always Start any search for any type of information with Amazon. And seldom have they let me down. I will continue to checkAmazon before any other type of Book.This is an "" Amazon Reviewed Item""."
5,Quick and easy reference,"Great, easy reference with just the right amount of pertinent info that is simple to understand. Well laid out for quick referencing."
5,cholesterol for dummies book,This book helped me learn about the cholesterol medicines you can take for cholesterol problems. It has their names and terms are explained for people that know very little about cholesterol.
3,Useful,"This is a book which thoroughly explores cholesterol. While user-friendly like all of the Dummies series, it is also written with grace and insight. I have found the book interesting and useful. I have completely stopped caffeine beverages, like coffee. After eliminating my coffee habit with the help of a wonderful coffee substitute made from soya beans called ""Soyffee"", I'm feeling so much better. My doctor recommended it to help lower my cholesterol and promote strong bones. It's available online at www.So y c o f fe e.com to find it."
4,Moen Cartidge Puller,"I had read from others what a difficult time they had removing a Moen faucet cartridge from a shower valve. I did not want to experience breaking off the cartridge inside the valve as has happened to many others. Many folks recommended buying this puller to remove the cartridge. When I opened up the valve, I could see their point. The cartridge was unlikely to come out easily. The instructions for the puller are a bit vague (and possibly incorrect) on how to use it. But I figured it out and the cartridge came out easily. Now I'm ready for when the other shower valve stops working."
1,It did not extract the catridge sleeve,"It came from Wholesale Plumbing without instructions, and it was not made by Moen as claimed by Amazon. I found instruction on google. It pulled out the cartridge stem but left the sleeve stuck inside, so I am stuck now. Amazon should not list this product as manufactured by Moen. In fact the poor manufacturing is evident by the 2 tongues that are supposed to turn the sleeve and are very week and seem to bend. If your cartridge is not stuck strongly it may work, but then there isn't much of a need for a puller, Moen supplies a cartridge twister with the cartridge."
5,Puller was needed for the job,"This cartridge puller was very necessary for the job for a novice. You can watch on UTube a video about how to use it for the task at hand and if you have a question, call the Moen help line. The help line number is provided with accompanying instruction sheet with this cartridge puller. This item is for a pre 1990 (year) for the Moen unit you would be replacing."
5,A Life Saver,Do yourself a favor just buy this puller and get the job done. Tryed differnt pullers and alot of hints off the web. Within 5 min. old cartridge was out and installing the new cartridge was being replaced. Save time and get the correct tool. Worth the extra money
2,This is not a Moen Genuine Factory Tool,"This is a copy of Moen's cartridge puller. How do I know? Because I own both.Moen's tool has a different stem screw, Moen's tool is lighter, Moen's tool comes with instructions and is packaged in a hard plastic clam-pack.For a few dollars more you can buy the cartridge tool directly from the Moen factory and it's genuine. Just search for Moen's toll-free number. Here's a side-by-side photo of the two...copy and paste:img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/Leander/IMG_0214_zps136d1fad.jpg"
1,does not work for 1222 cartridges,I bought this at home depot for $13. It didnt pull out the cartridge no matter how hard I pulled. I'm going to have to find out some other way to remove the 1222 cartridge. I don't know how well it works for the other styles. Pretty expensive for a one time use tool that doesn't work.Update:This tool only pulled on the brass stem of the cartridge and if that rips out then you are stuck with a cartridge stuck in the piping. That is a common problem from what I've seen on youtube. I used a simple pair of vice grips on the plastic body and twisted and slowly pulled it out.
3,Works except if the cartridge retaining ring is loose,"If cartridge is in perfect shape, this tool will work fine. My problem was a shower cartridge mounted horizontally. However, before I got the tool, I tried rotating the cartridge with a punch which somewhat deformed the tabs, thus the tool could not rotate the cartridge to loosen it. I had also used a rod through the handle part and pulled the retaining ring out so that the internal parts came out OK but the cartridge outer shell stubbornly remained stuck. So, when I used the puller part of the tool, it just popped out the retaining ring and again removed the core of the faucet. So, was a waste of money for my purposes. My bet is that it will work fine for sink faucets mounted at an angle, but horizontally mounted shower cartridges will defeat the tool."
2,Get this instead,"If you have an old cartridge that hasn't been replaced for ages chances are it will be very hard to get out, and if you do get it out you may only get the insert and not the casing. I reccomend the Danco Two-in-One Core Puller (60885) that can be used to pull out the cartridge and the casing should they become separated. [...]"
2,not worth it.,"i was so excited to find out they were finally putting one of my favorite movies on DVD. atleast until i saw that it is no different than the VHS. this, as all theatrical releases (except Kubrick's films) have been shot in some aspect of widescreen since the seventies. so why they didn't take this film off the original print in order to restore the widescreen is beyond me. not only is this DVD in fullscreen but it doesn't even have any extras, so what's the point. you are better off with the VHS or see it on cable. there is no difference."
5,Pam's review,"I think the whole expereience with Amazon was great. amazon said that I would have my products in 3-5 business days and they were right. I would definitely order from here again, the order came just in time to watch for the Christmas holidays. All the movies that I ordered were great as well."
3,breakin,"i had fond memories of this film from my childhood. it wasn't great, but it just has alot of those feel-good moments. to be able to watch it after all these years with my own children made the experience, for me, that much more special."
4,Back in the Dayz,"Yo, I know it was just pop lockin' but it was still the bomb movie back in 84. Breakin'was the movie that introduced Pop-lockin'to the east-coast and all the rest. The movie Beat Street should have been called Breakin...Because they were breakin'!Yall remember Re-Run--he should have been in Breakin. He would have turned Ozone out."
5,Breakin Breaks All the Rules,"Attention 80s babies! Breakin is the quintessential 80s movie. You've got bad hair, bad clothes, and bad acting (and when I say bad, I don't mean good). But what it does have is incredible dancing by the likes of Lucinda Dickey, Shabba Doo, and Boogaloo Shrimp (with street names like that they better have some hot moves or they'd be a joke!).What makes this movie so special is that the poor acting doesn't even matter. The characters are so lovable and talented that you focus on seeing them succeed. This movie captured the beginings of the cutting edge hip hop revolution with great energy and style that was just sweet and cheesy enough to not scare suburban America."
1,WHACK HOLLYWOOD BEAT STREET KNOCK OFF,"LISTEN I'm from the bronx and this movie is worst then having a fake pair of PUMA SNEAKERS. This is hollywood, not the real, go watch BEAT STREET for the real. Later"
3,Break out the cardboard box!,"Just like I remember it. Not as intense as the new breakin' moves these days, but just as fun to know how it all began.If you grew up in that era, I know you'll dig this movie. Brings back so many breakin' and poppin' memories, just don't try it at your age...ha! Just kidding...enjoy!"
4,Memories...,"If you love the art of dance and this takes you to a blast in the past, then buy this movie for the collection and the history. The story and acting is pretty bad, but the dancing is excellent! If you are looking for something with a good story, keep searching. If you want something entertaining, then this movie is worth it."
5,Break Dancing is awesome!,According to my 5 year old he is absolutely thrilled to see some old school break dancing moves. I love it when he pracitices on his own!
2,NO HEADPHONE JACK!,"I bought this for my cubicle, and while it sounds great, and is very compact, it has no headphone jack for the times I want to turn it up without disturbing others. If only it had a jack, this would be perfect."
1,A Very Short Affair,"plugged it in, turned it on, played a CD fine, flipped the switch to radio and it died. dead. finito. nada. So I had to package it up and send it back. Other than that it was fine."
5,Developing Math Understanding,"Most mathematics education methods books consist of endless lists of activities. You want to know how to teach subtraction? ""Use Base 10 Blocks."" Want to teach fractions? ""Use pie shapes split into different sizes."" Shallow approaches to teaching lead to simplified understanding of mathematics education. This book, on the other hand, provides a deeper explanation of WHY different approaches work. It examines the cognitive development of students, explores how they learn most effectively, explains why certain curricular approaches are more successful than others, and also provides the requisite list of activities and materials necessary to help students build their understanding of mathematics concepts. This book is as close to ""perfect"" as exists on the market."
4,Helping Children Learn Mathematics,Great book! Wonderful ideas on how to teach young children mathematics and make it interesting for them.
4,Excellent,I received the book in good condition even though I purchased it second hand. It is helpful for student-teachers who want to teach mathematics. I needed it for one of my units for BA Edu Primary and I found it helpful for learning.
2,Required text,"I had to buy this text for a class I took as an undergrad. Not a great read, but informational when it comes to teaching mathematics."
3,not satisfied,there were 20 pages or so in the back of the book that were perferated templates and they had been ripped out by the previous owner. i was very disappointed because it was part of the book and i expected it to be there.
3,doesn't fit the 24-volt Yardstick,"I had the impression that this spool could double as a replacement for the spool of the 24-volt version of the Yardstick. I must have misread something, though, because it does not fit in the housing. Instead, I had to manually transfer the line from the replacement spool to my existing spool. With Yardsticks no longer being manufactured, I guess I'll have to get used to this."
1,Yardstick replacement spool,"I thought I was out of line from the spool on my yardstick(it was jammed) so I ordered this replacement. As it turns out the original spool was nearly full but I didn't find that out until I took it off to install the replacement spool. At this time when the unit was one year old, I decided to see if there was an extra batteries available because the unit seemed to need more frequent recharging. I found out that this unit is not available anymore including the batteries. As it turns out I have three spools: the original, the spare one that I bought at the original sale and now the third which was supposed to be my spare. As I think about it now, I don't think I should worry about replacement spools for a unit that will have a limited life."
1,The Real Route,"Sorry Guys, but everything and more can be found on-line. There is a market for guide books that show the now-and-then kind of stuff. Of course you can read some items on-line but make sure that what you see is what you see."
3,They cook well and stack neatly...,"I purchased these pans for our boat, as space is limited. As I said, they cook well and stack neatly, but my concern was the handle. On my boat I can use three pans at a time, so when it comes to removing the pans from the burners you have to swap the handle with each pan. Well, the handle is much more difficult to use and position in the pan receptacle than one would think, so I contacted the manufacturer and tried to purchase another handle. The manufacturer, actually the importer...Made In China, told me they could not supply additional handles. I asked what would happen if I broke the handle, or worse yet, lost the handle, could they not supply a replacement? NOPE...no replacement, the only thing I could do is purchase a new set. This is a nice set of pans, but the complete lack of support on the part of the manufacturer/importer makes me question the wisdom of my purchasing decision. An $80.00 set of pans is dependent on a $5.00 handle. Hmmm...."
5,Excellent stuff this,"First of all, I was ecstatic to find a bunch of nestable stainless steel cookware, here in the US. Then, when the package arrived, I was jumping with joy because of its quality! Have used the entire set and extremely happy with it; heats evenly, doesnt char or burn the food, hence, no stains at the end of your cooking.Cant say much about the detachable handle since I've used it only once; felt sturdy enough though. Usually use the metal pot grabber.Saves a ton of space in the cabinets; highly recommend the set, even for everyday cooking!"
2,damaged goods,"I took a chance on this item because I am in the process of acquiring compact items for car-camping with my family this summer. This set seemed just perfect, and WOULD have been had I received the product in good condition! 4 of the 7 items arrived with dents, chips, and cracks.I am so disappointed as the stainless pans are a nice weight, nest together beautifully, and seem to be a quality product despite the dents on 2 of the 5 pans. The cracked and chipped handle and the chipped knob on the disgustingly lightweight lid left a lot to be desired, however. The box was undamaged, as was the tissue the pots were individually wrapped in, so this clearly is a quality control issue.I would NOT recommend this product at this point, though I have contacted Amazon with my concerns and anticipate a favorable outcome."
4,Refreshing!,"If you like unsweetened green tea, you'll like this. Taste great chilled, gives me a little boost of energy and it's supposedly good fer ya. Cute little can size too."
1,Horrible shipping and Dented Cans,This is my second shipment. Both had many (around 10) dented cans. Now the second shipment is short 2 cans (only 28 sent). This is unacceptable. Stay away from buying it from here. This is the worst way to do business. Buyer beware.Not worth the money you are saving.
3,bad packaging in shipping,Item is great alternative to all energy drinks out there.Whoever shippped this item didn't pack it well.I had 3 boxes with the items inside a bigger box.All small boxes opened up in transit and 60% of items are dented.They are still drinkable but how hard is it to pack a box well!
3,not what I expected....,"Probably my fault, should have read the description more carefully. The taste is hard to swallow... strong and bitter."
3,"good sencha, very bitter","This has a very distinct sencha flavor and was very, very bitter. It tasted like it had been steeped 20 minutes too long - which probably means it's really good for you or something. Not recommended unless you like strong Sencha and tannin flavor."
3,"Taste is not like fresh sencha, but OK cold","I am used to and enjoy the taste of fresh sencha, which is very bright, grassy and fresh. This canned version tastes dull and bitter-like if I brewed sencha for a half hour instead of for a minute or two and then let it sit for days--and also has that indescribably nasty taste that canned products sometimes pick up from the can. I will not be purchasing another batch . . . although I could be persuaded to try it again if a version in glass jars was available. Update: it does taste much better with ice cubes."
3,Bad Packaging Good for Energy,"Bitter tasting but tea is good for energy. Adding sugar substitute, a little natural or lime seltzer water improves taste and is more refreshing. Horrible packaging (no excuse) and dented cans compels me to find alternative vendors."
1,SHIPMENTS ALWAYS ARRIVE DAMAGED,Amazon should work on the shipping packaging. Most of my shipments of the Sencha Shot arrive as a damaged carton of loose and heavily dented cans. It's a good thing that the cans are made of heavy bimetal or they would probably leak in shipment. I like the product but I'm getting tired of receiving damaged shipments.
4,Helps you loose weight,I don't like the taste but I squeeze lemon juice in it. It helps you stop eating too much during the day so I feel it helped me loose some weight.
5,Great Deal - Lots Less Stress !!,This is the way to purchase in bulk without the hassle of shopping with the crowds at the stores during the holidays!I bought this cocoa to pack into gift packages I made up for a charity organization for Christmas this past December. It added a little bit more to their cookies & mugs gifts I put together for all! Lots of fun and I knew that Swiss Miss was going to be 100% quality!Thanks!
1,Swiss Miss-ing the Marshmallows,"I've counted the marshmallows in each packet I've opened: exactly 7.SEVEN lame, microscopic dribbles of dehydrated corn syrup.After this batch, I gave up and bought Ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate and use mini-marshmallows that I buy separately. Yum.DO NOT BUY THIS if you expect any marshmallows."
3,Swiss Miss Hot chocolate,I ordered this and have shared this with friends and family and only one thing was missing more marshmallows!!
1,This stuff sucks,"I used to buy Swiss Miss with marshmallows but no longer. The marshmallows used to cover the entire surface and now there is *maybe* half a dozen, which melt 30 seconds after you add the hot water. Also, the old portions used to make a full cup but not any more. Now you get a crappy three-quarters of a cup. Now I just buy the cheap stuff and add my own marshmallows since the quality and portion of this supposed name brand has diminished so much.Don't bother with this crap, you're just as well off with the store brand and your own marshmallows."
4,Tea Maven on Stash Indian Tea,This is the first time I bought Stash Assam tea. I expected it to be a stronger blend. I added a extra tea bag to every pot of tea and I got that extra flavor..
5,It's like it was written for me and my sister,Every page brings a memory of some sort. It applys to any one who has a sister they care and share with.
1,Worthless,This in-pool basketball goal was junk! Wouldn't stay together or bend right and had to throw it away before even using it. Not worth ordering and wasn't worth sending it back and having to pay shipping to return it. Don't waste your money!
1,waste of a great cast,"After about 15 minutes I couldn't take the ice age pace of this glacial movie. What a colossal waste of a great cast (although for the life of me Rachel MacAdams could be Elizabeth Banks as they are so identikit to be scary...this movie has MacAdams in case you can't tell your blonde dye jobs without a program).I was fast-forwarding it and it didn't get any better. Even the stylish look of the movie did nothing for me. Maybe in this ""Mad Men"" era I demand a bit more of the whole suppressed society in suits and women in the kitchen stereotypes.Whatever the case I apologize for not giving this a more in-depth critique but I thought I'd warn others who have my levels of patience for pace in a movie."
3,Middleweight period-piece drama,"I rented this on a whim, in part because I'd read that it resembles a Hitchcock movie. It doesn't, really, but it's a decent little drama that captures the look and feel of a bygone era almost perfectly. It's not really a thriller, or a comedy, or even a heavyweight drama. It's more of a character study, with a couple of suspenseful scenes along the way. I enjoyed it, but it's pretty forgettable. This movie reminded me in some ways of Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven."" If you liked that, you'll probably like ""Married Life,"" and vice-versa."
3,Married Life by Brandon M. Moskos,"This is a movie about married life in the late 40's. It shows a married couples' problem in that time period and how leaving your wife or husband was not an option in that era. Both the husband and wife are not in love anymore and they're both cheating, but they will not ask for a divorce, because they can't bare to see the other person unhappy. This was true that divorce did not happen in this time period, but I thought the story that the husband would rather see his wife dead than divorce her is crazy. The movie was suspenseful, but I thought it was unfunny and not that entertaining. I recommend renting this movie rather than buying, this movie was average."

2,boring no climax not even great foreplay... weak story line..but relatable,cant say its a complete waste of time..but i can think of other things i should have spent money and time doing...i thought perhaps the acting would eventually offset the dry script...but no...
2,Last Night I stayed up to watch this and...,"Well, I decided to watch a movie and because of the long, long download time to get it into my DVR, I had to watch it the next night instead.Well, well, when the movie - LAST NIGHT - started, it looked okay to me but I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened! It was one of the more sleep encouraging movies I have ever sat through.You might call it The Last Night in Two Dull People's Lives! OMG, it was so boring!!!"
2,it's a dud,"The story had potential, but ultimately I found it extremely slow and unconvincing. I kept looking at the clock to see when the end would come. If you are looking for great relationship films, try Before Sunrise and Before Sunset."
3,Just ok...no real arc to the story...,"The movie is just so-so! There isn't much depth to the characters and the storyline feels one dimensional. There is no arc to the story, it's pretty flat. Not the worst movie but certainly not the best. The actors seem to do their best with what they were given. There really was no tension created that caused one to empathize with the characters. I would have rather paid less to watch it. Wait until it becomes a deal of the day."
5,The tension in this movie kept me interested all the way to the end,"I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much. It has an underlying story that I've seen before, but this particular film adds an element of sexiness and tension that I didn't find in films with a similar plot. You can really feel the anxiety and excitement of the characters. The entire movie is about a short period of time, but it doesn't feel slow or boring. Overall, wonderfully composed and a good choice of actors. I definitely recommend."
2,Not much for entertainment,Nothing about this film was horrible but nothing was better than average either. Everyone plays his/her role well but it is a rather slow moving film and didn't take much imagination to conclude how each character would play out. I realize that is probably the point of the film but I regret the time I wasted watching a married couple's evening as they question their futures together.
2,Subtle Tease That Doesn't Quite Deliver,"This is not a terrible movie. At times it captures both marital and sexual tension in subtle ways. However, some of the dialogue is unrealistic (say, when Keira Knightley says to her former lover after two minutes, ""Tell me something that counts""), and the film as a whole doesn't have enough substance to fill 95 minutes. I'd think of it as a short story trying to masquerade as a novel. The overall effect is something akin to a tease: Will they be unfaithful, or won't they? The question is fine, but by the end, you don't care that much because the film hasn't revealed any fine nuances beyond what you get in the first 10-15 minutes. Sam Worthington is a little like a statue in heat: You can somehow tell that he wants Eva Mendes, but he's so wooden that he's almost funny."
4,Keeping it real,Light entertaining real without excess drama. Keira is a pleasure to watch. Apt for watching with your significant other. Pass
2,last Night,Kiera knightly normally has selected excellent movies to star in. I found this one very dull and boring-a complete dissapointment
3,Just Okay,"I found this movie, just okay- with a sort of lame dumb ending. Its about a marriage with temptations, cheater's, and what if's ... glad I only rented & did not buy, It was okay; just not one I would care to see more than once."
4,"Price was high, but it fits my standard adjustable dumbells","Price was high, but it fits my standard adjustable dumbells. It's a round plate that weights 2.5 pounds as promised."
1,Very expensive for a donut-shaped slab of painted iron,"This is a flat, doughnut-shaped weight-plate made of painted iron with a 1"" hole in it. Champion sells them, but only some have the words ""Champion"" imprinted on the plate. They're all made in China. Wal-Mart currently sells the same plate for $7.77. Academy sells CAP branded 2.5lb plates for $2.13 at their stores only, according to their website."
1,Don't expect refund if returning,I returned the item as instructed. I asked for confirmation letting me know when it was received. I received my confirmation about a month ago but still never received my refund. Now I am out of money and a product.The only reason that rated this a 1 was because it wouldn't go further. I really want to give it a 0.
5,Be Nice (Or Else!),I am a hairstylist and have read many motivational books. This book is well written and awesome. I am buying it for my friends. It is a great book for people of all careers. You will love it too. It might even change your life.
3,This item includes tubing,"If you are ordering this item be aware that although the seller says that it does not include CO2 tubing, it really does. I spent an additional $6 bucks to the seller for 6 feet of tubing."
3,Worth a listen,"I deleted my earlier 2-star review because, after another half-dozen listens, I didn't think it was fair. These guys aren't great but they are kind of interesting; a bit like Slayer but more subtle. The vocals are probably the weakest aspect of the band. The songs aren't all-out thrashers but there are some interesting riffs. The soloing isn't great (but it is better than Slayer--not that that's saying much). It's a live recording so, obviously, the quality isn't perfect but I wouldn't hold that against them.I haven't heard any of the studio recordings but, based on this CD, I'd say they're worth a listen.Recommended."
5,An Essential for anyone who call themselves metalheads...,"The filming is raw (as the title says) but the sound is very good. The feel of such rawness makes you feel like you are there. Even though the sound is not ""perfect"" it's even better than supposedly pro-films by bands like Megadeth, just to give you an example. You get to hear every cymbal and there is very good definition from one chord instrument to the other. They play flawless and fiercely. Listen folks, buy it and you will not regret it a bit."
3,Not Enough Older Material,"Okay, 3 and a Half. I've been a fan of these guys forever, and the revolving line-ups has always worked to the utmost advantage. Chuck was an absolute genius, and his guitar skills highlight this otherwise uninspired DVD. I don't mean to say it doesn't sound excellent-it does! But the limited cameras and angles and lack of any interspersed extras like fan interviews or backstage scenes is disappointing. The musicmanship on display is incredible. Fast and Heavy and Hard-Hitting as you would want a metal show to be. I just wish there was more material from their first 3 CD's, mainly the first two. I know time restraints forced some songs to be cut, and maybe they were from those CD's. Torn to Pieces or Regurgitated Guts from Scream Bloody Gore would've been cool, as would Open Casket from Leprosy. But it's worth the cost to see Chuck alive and doin' what he lived for. You can see the passion and devotion to the music and the genre in his eyes, man."
5,I loved it!,"I rented this video first, but unlike the other reviewer, I loved it. I have never done any weight-training before, because I thought it was too hard and too boring. In the first two weeks after doing the video three times a week, I lost three pounds. I found the video to be very inspiring, easy to follow and made me look forward to the workouts. She recommends that you watch any exercise video before you start working out, which is a really good idea, and you should do anyway. I recommend this video to beginners through advanced. My husband, who has weight-trained since high school, says this is an excellent video with challenging workouts for both men and women."
2,Lack of instructions,"I rented this DVD before making the decision to buy. I won't be buying it. I've used her books in the past, with success, but only b/c of those books was I able to follow along with the DVD. She doesn't provide any exercise explaination, or form guidance. Not a good work out for beginners, I'm an intermediate level and I still didn't think it was great. For the bra fat it's mostly back exercises, and you need at least 3 sets of weights, for her super sets, which is not explained ahead of time. The butt workout doesn't require any weights. I'm only giving it two stars, I think there are better workouts out there."
2,Disappointed!,"I'm a graphic designer, and I did a lot of research, including ""professional"" sources such as photography mags & websites, before choosing the Epson 1650. I've found this scanner disappointing -- it consistently clips the shadows and highlights so that very dark areas scan to muddy gray while the brightest areas come out about 25% darker. Tweaking the Twain settings to expand the range pulls more black into the shadows but still misses the c,m & y and vice versa on highlights. So on color scans, there is a lack of richness at both ends. I also use the scanner for OCR, and the bundled OCR software is horrible."
2,Technical Support is Terrible,I purchased the Perfection 1650 Photo about a year ago. I have been waiting for a driver for the Mac OS X ever since. None in sight yet. If you attempt to contact Epson Technical support you are referred to a *snailmail* address. Unbelievable!! I tried it and got no response. I am sorry I bought the thing.
3,3rd year review. Good hardware but software is problematic.,"As with the other reviewer from a while ago, I installed and uninstalled Epson's 1650's software several times on different machines. It left a lot of bugs. I had trouble having it work with other programs.But most of all, right now I am trying to use the scanner again on several new computers I have, and surprisingly enough, Epson's website does not carry the Epson Smart Panel application. You only get the Twain drivers so that means I am out of luck with trying to scan anything except if I hunt around for another party's software that would work with this twain driver. If you think you will rely on epson's website to get your updated application for this scanner, you are out of luck."
4,"Easy to use, good quality, fast enough","I'm very happy with this scanner - most photos scanned only require some basic dust and lint correction in PhotoShop or similar. Can scan negatives or slides, though the interface to do this is a little less than ideal and it's easier to scan prints if you have them. Software provided is flexible, allows scanning to files or scan to printer (copy feature). TWAIN interface allows interaction with PhotoShop or other software directly - easy to acquire new images. When I bought this scanner, a lot of folks were complaining about the dust on the backside of the glass, but I didn't really see much of that with mine. It is a little difficult to keep clean, though."
3,NOT for XP Pro...,"This scanner worked fine on ME, but we all know how well ME works. I upgraded to XP PRO, and just can't get the software to work. Mechanically, the scanner is fine, but the software and support from Epson and Newsoft has left a lot to be desired. I have spent HOURS on the phone to both support groups, but error code (-115) seems to be unbeatable. Never mind, Epson, I'll buy the Canon next time. Vote with your dollars."
4,Great little scanner,"I really like this scanner. It scans quickly and the images look great. The software is easy to use. The only complaint I have is this: I batch scan... so I was using the Smart Panel... (their software). Once done scanning a bunch a photos, I hit ""launch"" to launch the program of my choice (Photoshop). There wasn't enough memory to open Photoshop, so I quit out of several programs. Upon returning to the Smart Panel all my scans were gone. I called tech support and they said that that was how it works.But other than that, I really like it."
1,Dont get,"the special effects are cheesy, the actors suck, it isn't gong off the story line of the original story line, dont waste your money"
1,This movie is just plain stupid!,H.G Wells War of the Worlds is a true stinker. This movie has cheap special effects and really terrible acting. It's worse than I expected. I hate this stupid movie and this movie doesn't have anything to have you entertained. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
5,Great product,Looks exactly as the oem one. The light fit just as the old one. Great product an really good price nothing compared to what the dealer was asking for the same light.
5,Great near OEM replacement part,"These tail lights brought my 1999 Ford F150 back to stock after I purchased it custom. They look exactly like the manufacturer tail lights and are clean and nice. Super easy to install with the bolt holes matching up nearly exactly (I recommend installing both bolts loosely instead of doing one and tightening it down and then moving to the next). This will help with fitment. Note: This product doesn't come with bulbs, it's just the light assembly (the lights plug right in though)."
2,Loose connection,"The top bulb harness fit in nice and tight, but the bottom harness is very loose,. Im worried that in a few months, the reverse light harness will fall right out, or moisture will get in,. I checked the rubber seal on the harness and that seems fine. I might just glue it in with removable silicone. Other than that, it was a 1 minute job to get the tail light replaced."
2,Product came leaking oils?,"After the amazing reviews, I bought (2) of these for my nieces. One came undamaged...the other was leaking an oily subtance out of the box onto the plastic wrapping. Was too late to re-order so I purchased another gift instead and gave the diary to my 13yo daughter well before Xmas (unwrapped of course). She's too old for this but... oh well.I would buy from Alex toys again because I think it's a quality product but as a Prime Member would prefer gentler handling in packaging. Not sure who's to blame. Beautiful product none-the-less."
5,Mike Marshall Mando #2 chords,This is over my skill level but I'm working toward it. He is very positive and takes it step by step.
2,NET !!!!!!!!!!,Net won't stay on. No details in instructions. Nothing to hold net on sides or top!!! Sending back.2 stars for the high quality Ball and cover! SAD for my children.Also 1 goal only!
3,check the size,"Oops, this is probably my fault, but while looking for a rewritable dvd for my sony handycam, I found this and it caught my attention. The cheap price made it tempting and I ordered three at once. When I got them in the mail, they were normal cd size, and obviously too big for my my mini disc camcorder. Make sure you know what you're buying this for before you purchase it. I wish they would make it better known in the discription."
4,As expected - except for a stain on sleeve,"This was our first item ordered, and it came as ordered, but one of the sleeves had a bad stain on it, which must have been shipped that way. We were able to wash the stain out (mostly), but we did not return the item because it was needed for Halloween. Maybe Amazon will give us some credit towards a next purchase."
2,I agree - No Widescreen :(,"Great movie. I had it on VHS but wanted it for DVD. But, sadly, it was not released in Widescreen, and not having that option kind of bothers me about DVD releases.Given all that, since I got the disk for free (at Best Buy they offered a free DVD from a small set if you bought The Sure Thing and Valley Girl together), I can live with this format (for now). Maybe they'll do a special edition some day (though I doubt it as it wasn't a high profile film). Sigh."
3,"THIS WAS NOT MEANT TO BE A ""FUN"" film--get over it people!","All the negative reviews here lead me to believe that people just don't get this film. It's not great by any stretch of the word, but it is good for what it is.It paints a grim (but realistic) view of what life could be like in Manhattan if you were depressed, disillusioned, and had a cocaine habit.The fact that this is probably the only film in existence with this much footage shot at the Palladium, NYC (which no longer exists), is worth the price of admission.I also find it strange that nobody is commenting on the MUSIC!! The soundtrack is excellent, and propels the film very effictively.How can you go wrong with Prince, Donald Fagen, New Order, & Bryan Ferry?Good movie."
1,Tedious,Man! They call people today self-absorbed! This movie felt so repetitive (how many times do we need to see the main character bolt for a bathroom stall to get high?) and forced. I ended up leaving it on as background noise while doing better things with my time than continue watching. The only thing powerful about this movie was how powerfully self-important and tedious it was!
1,Dull,it was only Average at the time of it's release.Michael J Fox was Pretty good in this film but the film goes no where.forgettable on a whole.
4,Consistent,"This movie was very consistent with the book which, if you liked the book, which made this a good movie.Having read the book before seeing the moving gave me a bit more insight into the story. But even without reading the book first, viewers may watch in disbelief, wondering how long will it take for Michael J. Fox's character to kill himself or change his ways. Suffering through this drives home the ending of the film, and makes this the moving story that it is!A well done film with a strong cast! The soundtrack isn't bad either..."
2,NO WIDESCREEN?,"First Touchstone Home Video releases New York Stories in Full Screen only, now MGM does the same thing with Bright Lights Big City. Is this the beginning of a new trend? I sincerely hope not. At least give the option of selecting full screen or widescreen on the disc. Really liked this movie but the DVD release could have been better to say the least. I give this 2 stars for DVD quality only. One star for that the movie got released in a decent transfer (even without widescreen), the other that at least they bothered to include the theatrical trailer.Other than that, disappointing......."
2,Whites lines,"Stripped of the author's light, spicy prose, and left with just the thin story and some arch dialogue, Jay McInerney's go-go 80's New York novelette falls flat.Michael J. Fox is earnest but miscast as an irresponsible fact-checker for a version of The New Yorker, and director James Bridges tackled coked-up yuppie disillusion with infinitely more heft in his film ""Mike's Murder"" four years earlier.""Lights"" has aged better than ""St. Elmo's Fire"" or ""About Last Night..."" But it's worth noting Fox's character decides to stop having fun in the film's last scene, a half-assed happy ending in which the protagonist gazes optimistically at the World Trade Center towers in the distance."
3,"Love the book, Movie is okay","Movie duplicates almost every scene from the book masterfully. Unfortunately, Michael J Fox as the coke snorting, party, magazine editor lead character is horrible. Fox looks all of 21 in the film and in everyone scene you expect him to say to "" Ive got to get Back to the Future""."
3,Surprisingly less dated than expected,"Despite being almost 30 years old, this 80s relic still looks relatively undated, a tribute to the designer of the film. Michael J. Fox, however, is a poor lead, looking impossibly fresh and cherubic no matter how many lines of coke he does or drinks he consumes. He is way too innocent-looking for the role, which would have been better with the lizardy Kiefer Sutherland in the lead and someone else as Ted Allagash, the debauched pal. Whatever happened to Phoebe Cates? She doesn't look good here, with a bad pixie haircut. The book, as usual, is way better."
3,Could've been better,"Good acting and good story that just doesn't live up to its potential.If not for Kiefer Sutherland's dead on portrayal of a yuppie, Manhattanite scum, it would have been less stars. But his performance raises it a notch if only in a supporting role.Look for a then unknown Niles from ""Frasier"" as a bartender at the fashion show."
2,Surprisingly Slow-Paced for a Movie About a Cokehead,"Much love and respect to Michael J. Fox. Agreeing to be cast as a cokehead at a time that he was one of the biggest comedic stars in Hollywood takes balls. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't fire on all cylinders. It could be that movie-making has matured in the past two decades. For a movie called ""Bright Lights,"" the movie's cinematography is oddly muted. The pace is also dated, but...""Bright Lights Big City"" is painfully s-l-o-w.Fox snorts coke for an hour and a half, talks about writing a novel, and pines for his estranged wife. To say his character is disillusioned is an understatement. At one point, he says his job is ""pretty tedious."" I couldn't agree more."
2,very dissapointing!,This movie was so dissapointing. fox did a good job but phoebe cates was only in it for 5 minutes if that! and so was dianne wiest! although the scene between wiest and Fox while she is dying is heartbreaking. this movie really goes nowhere but at least the soundtrack is great.
1,Warning: Contains Mercury!,"I purchased this product about a month ago. It seemed like a very odd product to me, as much of the writing on the instructions was in arabic. After a little bit of research, I learned that this product has been banned in Europe because it contains mercury -- which is poisonous to the human body.For the sake of your own health, I do not recommend that you purchase this product. Hopefully this review will also cause the seller(s) of this product to stop doing so."
3,Fun reading but not always helpful.,"We enjoyed reading this entertaining guide prior to our trip to Venice. However, we found some of the information included not to be accurate. For example, the guide told us that a special white wine was produced and readily available on the island of Burano. Wnen asked for this wine at several stores and markets, we were greeted by confused looks by the staff.. . local wines yes. . .but not produced on this island. Local maps for some areas were not available. Though the tiny island of Burano had an easy to use map, none was provided for Murano (the 'glass' island) that receives many tourists.There was a lot of detailed information about the cathedrals and museums included in the guide. However, if you are looking for an 'overview' guide with basic information, I would choose another."
5,Rick Steves - The Easiest and Most Reliable Travel Books!!!!,"Rick Steves - The Easiest and Most Reliable Travel Books!!!!It is so easy to use his books. Logically organized and not a lot of fluff but a whole lot of valuable and usable information!! Can never go wrong with these travel books. We won't travel without them anymore.This is our 2nd VENICE Rick Steves book. The info is always updated and the last 2 times we've gone to Venice it has been invaluable. GREAT Street walk guide and WONDERFUL museum guides. They save you time and money so that you can get the most out of your trip without spending TOO much time on redundent or time-wasting ""sights"". Take a bit of time before your trip to review the book and you can hit the ground running!! Enjoy the book and enjoy VENICE!!"
5,Great information!,"Like all Rick Steves' books, this one was easy to read and follow. His inside information was so helpful in planning a complete trip; sights, sleeping, and transportation. I hightly recommend this book if you are visiting Venice."
5,like having a personal tour guide,I plan to take this along with me to Venice. It is the perfect size to carry with you and provides quite a bit of very useful information.
5,Favorite toy,"We have the older version of this toy and it has been my son's favorite since he was 6 months old. He learned to walk by pushing it from behind. The storage seat is his secret hiding place for everything, plus a ""passenger"" compartment for his toy frog. The front and back fins make it extremely stable - he is still playing with it and riding it, even though one rear wheel came off when a bigger kid threw it. This toy is a favorite of every child who visits, too. Even the older kids enjoy pushing the buttons and playing the tunes, even if they're too big to ride it. It is great indoors and outdoors."
3,Cute toy-bad electronics,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because she loves Nemo. She loves it! The only complaint we have is that after about 2 days the electronics stopped working. We replaced the batteries but to no avail. Now we cannot exchange the product because it is discontinued.
5,My son likes this ride on the best...,"I was hesitant to get another ride on toy because I had already gotten my son the Chicco Ride On Train but I just could not resist this one when I saw it at Toys-R-Us. My son is in that phase where he just loves to push knobs and buttons so the front and console part of this one really satisfies that desire. When given the choice between this ride on and the Chicco one he tends to go for this one first because of the many things to play with on it. As far as stability, the Nemo wins again so I would have to say that this ride on is hard to beat especially if you have a Nemo fan."
4,This toy was a hit at a one year old's birthday party,The son of a friend of mine turned one and we got his this. He loved it and so did my 16 month old daughter Catie. At times she would ride it as the one year old pushed it. They both loved honking the horn and pushing the little buttons. The only concern I had with the toy was the bar that the child sits against. The one year old wasn't yet a walker and he got his leg stuck in the bar. He was able to pull it out without his father or mother intervening.
5,Best magnesium ever,I have been using this product for a few years now. I use it as a sleep aid. It also helps with joint problems as I have chronic Lyme disease. Every night I take four of these and sleep comes easily.
4,"Entertaining, hilarious, and witty",Blue Christmas was such an enjoyable read. It had me laughing at its silly plots but was very heart-warming too. They way each author incoroparted Elvis and the Original Heartbreak Hotel in their stories was very clever and never boring. This is a must read for everyone even if your not an Elvis fan!
4,Good value for the money,"We shopped this in many places and no one came close to this value. However, be prepared to have patience putting it together. It would help to have someone assisting. We ordered two and one box contained a damaged part. We called the manufacturer's 800 number directly and they said they would ship the part to us the next day, no questions asked or proof required. The only frustration we faced was not being able to get other pieces matching due to the fact that they are out of stock. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."
4,"""Glider"" ? Chaise Lounge","As far as assembly goes it's fairly easy, maybe an hour.Comfort is good as long as one puchases a decent cushion. I have one complaint, and that would be with design. The glide arms (metal) need to be about three to four inches longer to make for a smooth glide. As constructed the glide feature is very herky jerky. The overall wood finish is very good. If the loungewas re-designed with longer glide arms, it would be an excellentpurchase."
3,Toilet safety frame/hand rails,This product was great to have while I recovered from a fractured sacrum and pelvis.....BUT the hand grips are postioned so high (even in the lowest position) that use of the product can play havoc with one's shoulder rotator cuffs.
2,Lids cracked easily,"I loved the GladWare that I bought at the supermarket about a year ago, but it seems that they've changed the design of the lids. These new lids were very difficult to open, and several of mine cracked as I was trying to force them open."
1,Not worth the shipping to see what it looks like,I ordered this item in the hopes to get a hard case to protect my zen micro. This was the worst quality product I have ever ordered from amazon. It was cheap and filmsy and hardly clasped closed. I sent it back immediately. Don't waste the shipping fees!
1,Way out of date...,Do not buy this book. It was written over 10 years ago before they switched the test to multiple choice. The problems and answers are very wordy. Recommend the NCEES practice problems book available through their website...
4,Buy It,Arguably GG's best album. Country music done right by a rock and roll icon. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Even if you're not a GG Allin fan there is a good chance you will enjoy this - quite a divergence from his special brand of punk rock that made GG loved and despised all across the world.
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"The first time I used the true ceramic pro, the red ceramic coating on the plates flaked off. It was definitely not worth the money."
2,Not really what I expected,The iron is good but not as good as the CHI brand. I just checked online and the price between the two is about the same. They had to send me a replacement because the plates of the first one started to peel off.
2,True Ceramic Pro,"I purchased TWO True Ceramic Pro in December of 2006....one for myself and another as a gift. The one I gave as a gift broke in June of 2007 and mine broke in August 2007. I went to the website because they have a warranty and will send you a new one upon approval. Only problem, I was not approved for a new one!"
2,"Boring, and forget about the live Hunting","OMg, these are boring songs. This album is not worth it.I find it very humorous that a reviewer said the live performance was incredible because if you take away the audience, it would sound like studio. That's because Strato is pathetic live. You know why it sounds like studio? Because the band uses studio backing tapes live. This is the worst and most pathetic thing a band can do live. Backing tapes for vocals and instruments should be a crime."
4,Great Hair Color,"I love this hair color! But I was a little lerry using it because the tube was already ""punctured"" open. So far my hair has not turned blue though. : )"
1,its was a terrible experience,"this product dont even deserve one star i use goldwell 9NA with 9% hair developer all together i spend 30$ and its like i wasted my money on junk trust me it wont work, i am amazed to see so many good comments about this product it just waste of money"
4,"Pricey, but better than competiton.","The stuff works. Doesn't bother dog as much as salt products. Cheaper than competition, but expensive shipping. Seller is fine. No complaints. Better than average.The knuckleheads who write that it doesn't work are likely using it beyond it's capacity. Shovel first. Temps in the double digits are fine. The stuff doesn't contain magic snow removers and ice eaters. If keeping litigious people who don't take responsibility for themselves from having an opportunity to suck your money away from you is your motivation, shovel when it snows and use sand for traction and Safe Pet to keep ice from reforming. MIx it together, save trouble."
1,the picture looks great but....,"the picture of the shoe looks great but when i received the color was dull and the leather looked old. i would not recommend it, i returned it."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Wireless functionality for Palm is still a hit-and-miss game (at least with the MIK and Palm Vx). You may or may not have much success in getting the connectivity you seek, depending on the vagaries of your ISP, your wireless phone, and the actual site you're trying to connect to. My recommendation is to wait another year or two before pursuing this. By the way, Palm itself provides almost no support for this product."
5,excellent account of alternative city politics,"This book provides an astute account of alternative approaches to city politics other than the traditional, liberal approach. Moreover, his account of political equality is particularly good. Must have for American urban politics students!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST PORTABLE CD PLAYER AROUND,"I Live In Johannesburg South Africa. I Am Going On A (26 Hour) Train Ride And Wanted A Portable CD Player That Had The Best Anti-Skip System At A Reasonable Price. I Bought It For R1000, Slightly More Expensive Than America, But It Was Worth It. I Hooked It Up To My R2500 Hifi System And The Radio Reception Is At Least 10 Times Better Than The Hifi's One, And The CD's Quality Is At Least 50 Times Better Than My Hifi's CD Sound Quality. The Remote Control That Came With It Is Absoultely Awesome. It Plays All My Home-Recorded CD's With No Problem, And The Best Part About It Is That Almost No Matter How Much You Test Its Anti-Skip System, It Will Never Skip. GUARANTEED. I Highly Recommend This Player To Anyone Who Wants A Good, Affordable, CD Player With Radio And Remote Control. (Or Anyone Who Wants A Portable CD Player, Because It Is The Best Out There)"
1,"I thought it was called the ""Panasonic Jogger""","Despite the product name, it is impossible to jog with this machine. For the first twenty minutes or so, it works reasonably well, with only a few skips every now and then. But after that, it gets worse and worse until by the end (I usually run for an hour) it stops 20 or 30 seconds for each second of music that it plays. It works just fine when I'm walking, but then, it's not called the ""Panasonic Walker."" I had frankly hoped for something better from Panasonic."
5,No one better than THE MAN: Sammy Hagar!,Sammy has been tearing it up sine the seventies and doesn't look like he'll quit anytime soon.
4,Great Rock and Roll after a tragic breakup,"Sammy Hagar, with his cool tunes in the post VH era, will be remembered as the reason rock and roll won't die, and VH won't come close to his dynamic energy and popularity. Little white lie is fantastic, and we get a few stars in the process(Huey Lewis and Slash). I thought Marching to Mars is quite possibly the song he aluded to on an earlier album(check out his Best of Sammy Hagar: Includes hits like Red, Turn up the Music, Trans Am, and Bad Motor Scooter) and had a wonderful stage show in the Mesa Amphitheater in Arizona. In concert he proved the song very powerful. The rest is wonderful Sammy Hagar rock and roll! Hope everyone saw the show. Long live Sammy Hagar rock and roll!"
4,Serious but obviously necessary,"This album, while not Sammy's best, was something he needed to do after the ugly breakup with VH. For sure, the acoustic-turned-electric leadoff track, ""Little White Lie"", says it all about how he was feeling at the time. The rest of the album is filled with a variety of styles, most of them a bit different from the big heavy rock sound we are used to from Sammy. Some of the tracks are downright moody sounding with (for Sammy) understated vocals. With songs such as the pretty ballad ""Who Has The Right?"" and the rocking anthem ""The Yogi's So High (I'm Stoned)"", Sammy proved he still had the touch. For sure, his two solo efforts after this one brought him more back into a rocking mode. Still, this one is good to listen to now and then to hear something different. Definitely an interesting, worthwhile purchase."
2,this is the worst,"HOW CAN ANYONE WHO SAYS HE`S A SMMY HAGAR FAN,SAY THIS IS A 5 STAR CD.YOU GOT TO BE OUT OF YOUR MIND.I AM A SAMMY HAGAR FAN ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MONTROSE DAZE AND I`LL HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS CD FLAT OUT BLOWS.ANYBODY WHO SAYS THIS CD RATES A 5 STAR IS EITHER DRUNK OR STUPID.IF YOU ARE INTO HAGAR,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE."
3,"Sammy, baby, Sammy.","I've loved Sammy since the I can't drive 55 albumn. I loved everything he did in Van Halen as well. But this, well this is kind of weak. I love all the songs but just think that Sammy could have done better on the lyrics. I was really disappointed with the VH bashing he was doing. I can realize the hurt of being stabbed in the back but I think he shouldn't have expressed it in this albumn. Why stoop to there level Sam? It would have been an even bigger face to them to release an albumn worthy of your name, without the name calling to prove your bigger than that. All in all it's a good albumn but not what he is capable of. I can't wait for the next one. Keep rockin' Sam."
4,Hagar thinks smartly hiring stellar talent,"This album is stacked with well known guests. The first track has Slash and Matt Sorum of GNR and Huey Lewis. Brother Cane's Damon Johnson plays slide on ""On the Other hand"". Suprisingly Bootsy Collins puts his signature bass lines on the Van Halen shot""Would you do it for free"". But the main guest and contributor is Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, his drumming and sequencing on certain tracks mix well with Hagar. It's hard to believe he gets the last laugh compared to the uneven VH3."
4,Good Solid Come back,"After a great relationship and star studded career in one of the most influnetial metal bands of our time one would think...How could Sammy Hagar follow up with a solo album? Well he answered that question with a resounding ""told ya so"" Hagar's first effort post VH is a solid rocker that mixes in all aspects of music. Ballads, rockers, and pop tunes are all soon to be Hagar classics. He did not miss a beat with his new band. Seeing him the first of 3 times in Orlando (Once for Marching, once for Red Voodoo, and a third show) the live shows really showcase this album. Hagar is one of the greatest arena rock singers of all time. I will take this to my grave, there will never be another Hard Rock/Metal voice like Sammy Hagar's. This album proves it. Good stuff from the Red Rocker...Van Halen who?"
3,windows 98 FACTORY INSTALL!,"After installing the software EXACTLY as described in the documentation, the TWAIN driver did not function properly. The scanner does not work with my version of Windows98, which I recently re-installed on my PC.The system requirements posted online indicate that the scanner will only function for FACTORY INSTALLED Windows98, but the enclosed documentation says that the scanner will only work under Windows98 SECOND EDITION. I examined the system requirements before purchasing the scanner, but apparently not closely enough.UPDATE:I am giving a neutral three stars since the scanner works great with the twain driver."
4,"Great hardware, worthless software","I recently bought this scanner to do some photo scanning and to scan some of my wife's art for the web. It's a great piece of hardware and we've been very happy with the images it produces. The software, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The TWAIN driver works well, but the ""SmartPanel"" software is a horror: don't install it! The image editing program that ships with it is high on flash but low on usefulness (there's no scaling option, for example). The software isn't that big of a deal, though... All you need is an image editing program that can acquire from a scanner. I use graphics workshop professional, which meets all my needs quite well.So if you need a quality affordable scanner and are willing to roll your own software, I highly recommend it."
4,Windows XP and Epson 1250,"I'm loving this scanner. It is small, delivers great color scans, and does a great job with OCR as well.I bought the scanner to do a family reunion project, scanning of hundreds of old photos. I scan directly into Adobe Photoshop to made edits and to save photos.What is lacking is the software. I'd like to have a little more precise control over scanner output, like dpi rate and final scan size (blowing up a smaller photo to a larger one)For the most part, via additional software I can control the output.Overall, I'm happy with my 129 dollar scanner, it's doing everything I needed it to do for my project."
4,Excellent scanner for the Home user,"All in all I am very pleased with Epson's 1250. Scanning of Color photos is quick, accurate and yields excellent results. Having the extra DPI (12x24) doesn't hurt , but I haven't made use as of yet. Convenient one touch button makes it somewhat automatic. Only neutral comment is that once scanned, several programs need to run to complete your process. For a beginner, it may be somewhat confusing. Excellent."
5,Great!!!,"I have an 8 and a 14G Biocube both salt and I love both of them. The lights 10,000k and Actinic 420 actually last awhile I had the same bulbs for a year I got new one's your really supposed to change them about every 6-7 months for proper coral growth. NO BS whithin the first 3 hours everything opened up and has grown tremendously in the past 3 weeks now. You might complain about the price but for what they do and how long they last their 100% worth it."
2,Miss Melville Rides a Tiger,"Ms. Smith has a wonderful way with words: ""At first sight most of the people there seemed unfamiliar, then she picked out a few aged and bewildered-looking Rundles who had apparently been hauled out of their retreats, dusted off, and propped up here and there among the furniture, holding teacups in their shaky hands and smiling vacantly."" (page 76) The first third of the book was totally boring and not to my liking then when I was ready to just close it, put back in my give away pile, the story got good and ended great! It is a well written book, good literature but very old fashioned!"
5,excellent workout tape,"I love this video.It doesn't last very long,yet it is very effective.The tape lasts about 12 and a half minutes.If you workout with this tape regularly,you will be able to see a huge difference in your waistline and abs in no time.Buy this vhs tape and you won't be disappointed.You will be so happy with the results."
2,Ether not Included!,"Kind of PO'ed. Picture shows a can, but it is not included. Changes the value of the system."
3,it's OK,needed a reality check. Didn't represent military as I remembered. Action exagerated to some extent. Story line was interestinglyportrayed.
2,I am the only person who did not like this book?,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. I expected it to be a serious study of fame and what people do to get it. Instead, it was a series of old Vanity Fair articles strung together in a book. Some people were interesting but most many were boring people that no one really wants to read about.I hate that I paid $17.50 for it and hope my bad review does not drive down the resale value as I try to get rid of it."
2,Disappointing rehash of Vanity Fair articles,I wanted to like this book but was very disappointed that all it included was a mish mash of Vanity Fair articles from 1990-2002 with follow up paragraphs that appear to be right out of People magazine.
1,the importance of being famous,"this book is simply a re-hash of old Vanity Fair articles. She gets paid for those articles then slaps them together in a book for a second payday. What a lazy way to ""write"" a book?"
2,maureen orth wants it both ways,"How can she critique fame and the media's ""celebrity-industial complex"" without recognizing her own role in the complex? How can she decry the public's obsession with vapid celebrity status without acknoledging that as a Vanity Fair journalist, she is helping to create that obsession? Please!"
1,Is This A Joke?,"I had high hopes for this book, but It is nothing more than a tabloid junkie. It gives false details about Michael Jackson Case, articles taken from tabloids.I advise you to buy this instead:"" Redemption: The Truth Behind the Michael Jackson Child Molestation Allegations """
2,"For me, this was a sad disappointment.","I'm sure that Maureen Orth's career will carry on without false high praise from me. I want to give my honest opinion of The Importance of Being Famous, and I consider it to be a waste of my money and time. I purchased Ms. Orth's book from the remainder table at a flea market book stall. Usually, I give more attention to the content promised in my book purchases, but I was taken by the author's name and title. Too late I realized that this was a re-hash of previously published articles, and provided little insight into the phenomena of fame, itself.I felt that The Importance of Being Famous was somehow gossipy and boring at the same time, telling me what had been said many times before. Of course, it is my fault that the book was not what I had hoped for, but it is the author's fault that it was dry as the bones she picked over.I would not recommend this book to a friend."
5,Very Pleased!,I received the bracelet in just a couple of days and it was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughter as a gift for her end of year drama play!!
1,Stopped working after 2 weeks.,"This watch is a piece of crap. I only had to for 2 weeks before it stopped working and became totally useless. I though watches were proven pieces of technology that have been perfected over the last 100 years...boy was I wrong. The only thing that moves on this watch is the seconds hand...the hour and minute hands are completely frozen. Now I have to return it and get it repaired (for free, according to the warranty), but the shipping is coming my of my pocket. This manufacture is also insisting that I send him $20 so he can mail my watch back to me once he fixes it. Now I'm torn between throwing good money after a bad watch or do I take the hit, chalk it up as a lesson learned and buy a real watch? Be smart and don't make the same mistake I did.."
3,A product of its time,"So, it's 2002 and you want to know what Jungle is, what gear you should buy to make Drums N Bass, or where to go to learn more about ambient music? Yeah, this book would have been a decent choice. Odd and outdated today though."
5,"Long, high quality","High quality, slip resistant tip reduces chance of stripping screw heads. Extra long shank is great for reaching fasteners deep in a car's engine compartment."
3,war classics vol 1-3,"this was a fair dvd but the main movie i was looking for was ""COMMANDO"" starring stuart granger in ref to the algerian war of indepandance ,made in 1962, rel 1964 in the USA if you have or know where please info me thank you."
5,Winning Recipes,"If you're looking for a cookbook that never disappoints, try this one. I have three of Renny Darling's cookbooks (I'm buying this copy for a friend), and can't recommend her books highly enough. Whether you're a novice or an expert, her recipes are easy to read, understandable, and unique. This is a large, high-quality paperback, with eye-pleasing graphic style. Ingredients are often what you already have on hand, but if not, they're readily available at your local market. Most importantly, the result is food that is absolutely delicious! Of the three books I have, this is the one I use over and over again. So, if you're looking for a first cookbook or you only buy one of Renny Darling's books, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Yum!,This is a FANTASTIC cookbook- for beginners through gourmets. Recipes are easy to follow and every one I have tried has been delicious! Very highly recommended from a cooking teacher!
3,Marginal Telling of a Great Story,"I had such great hopes for this book... but most of them were dashed. On one hand you have a story that rates in the ""Top Ten"" of the most compelling tales in U.S. naval history. In that same hand, a fictionalized account gives an author the opportunity to immerse the reader to the neck into the story, as only historical fiction can do. There was great potential in the idea! On the other hand you have an author that did not do justice to the story. Character development, dialog and action scenes were not of a quality that would make it outside a self-published environment. There are many other problems but I really don't want to beat the author up. It was a sincere effort on his part. It was good enough to finish and to give three stars. Most of the good comes from the Big Ben story itself and that makes it worth reading. Worth paying $20-plus bucks for... I'm not so sure."
5,Great Read,This is a no-holds-barred assessment of what actually happened aboard a mighty carrier when she was almost torn apart as a result of enemy action. The heroic and the mean... all the various personalities of those onboard are revealed.
5,Funny Show,I love this show. I watch it every chance I can. She try to keep up appearance but things always mess up for her.
2,This is not a TAB book,"Hi,I bought the book based onthe reviews. One of which called the book a TAB book. There is no TAB is this book and the chords are too simplistic. So if you are buying it for playing the guitar ... take my advice ... forget it !!"
1,NOT A GUITAR TAB BOOK!,"If you play the guitar and want to sound like The Edge then do not by this book! It has only guitar chords, sheet music, and lyrics. For instance, if you want to know the guitar riff Edge uses on ""God Part II"" you will not find it here. I don't think there is a guitar tab book for this album. At least I haven't found one. Good luck finding a guitar tabs for these songs."
4,Useful thermopile for old furnaces,"This thermopile has revived our old wall furnace. We couldn't find the part in local stores and finally bought it online. Since the old part doesn't have model number on it, it's a little gamble to buy just based on the online product photo. In the end, it turned out well. I guess there are not many thermopiles with spade connections, which are quite different from those of the newer thermocouples. So if your old furnace stops working, be sure to check the voltage generated from the heated thermopile. If it's much lower than 750 mv, you might make it work again by replacing this little part."
2,Control glitches ruin the experience,"Let me start by saying that I've played a few rounds of golf, but I am not a golfer.That being said... This game is pretty fun, and in many ways is more like a ""golf simulator"" than others I've looked at. (Thanks to the Wiimote.)But, there's a glitch with the wiimote capture, and it doesn't happen in any other games I have, so I know it's a software problem here. I'll be going along playing 9 holes, doing reasonably well, and all of a sudden, the game will strike the ball while I'm still in my backswing. That's right, a 3-wood shot for about 20 yards.Sure, yeah, it's a game. But this is a game where every shot counts, literally, and having the software screw you up by what sometimes comes up to three shots on a single hole trying to recover from a control glitch will just totally ruin the entire game session."
4,Don't be a hater while drinking juice in the hood,"This game is legit. I know that folks have been hatin this game because it is the same as '07 and because the graphics are poor, but what they seem to miss or don't understand is that this is a challenging and cerebral game, just like the real thing! Plug it in and enjoy. Don't believe the bad press. Reccomend for those who don't own '07 and an xbox 360."
3,Playing golf? Me?,"I bought this game for my adult son who is really enjoying it. He says he gets some exercise just swinging that rod, he loves it. It is not for me to use, I am a working mother who does not like golf."
2,NOT SO GOOD,This game has very good graphics but the sensitivity is awful. its hard to aim the wii remote straight so the ball doesn't go to the right or left
1,"Horrible graphics, even for a Wii","I just want to say that I know the Wii does not have the video output of an XBOX360 or PS, but the graphics in Tiger Woods Golf '08 are horrible. I have a 50"" plasma that the Wii is hooked up to and do not really have any issues with other games (Mario Galaxy looks great), but the text you have to read in the Tiger Woods game is pretty much unreadable. The courses look great, but if you can't read half the text what's the point!"
4,Pretty cool game,"This is one of the first 5 games we've bought for our Wii, and so far it's the most fun. The career mode is pretty cool, the variety of courses is impressive, and the use of the wiimote is awesome."
3,Tiger's Tour is Tough,"Tiger's Tour 2008 is good once you can get into it. It takes a while to figure out the nuances and additional time to get started. Be sure that you have LOTS of time if you want to play. It is fun when you get the hang of it. Graffics are OK but could be better. Sometimes the controls are a bit questionable and unreliable. Overall, it is fun... I guess I just expected more of Tiger!"
3,left handers beware,"I have grown to like this game very much, but it does have glitches.. Particularly for a left hander, and worse for a left hander that putts right handed. At first these glitches were enough to toss the game, but I kept it up, and the misfiring has gotten much less, though no less aggravating.I have had to also putt left handed, and this served to help a great deal.I have just received the 2009, and I can see that is going to take a long adjustment period..Little is the same..Here we go againI would buy the game again even after knowing about it's shortcomings."
3,Too complicated for Dad,"Got this for a Christmas present for my father who absolutely loves the golf game on Wii Sports. He plays it every single evening when he gets home from work. Unfortunately, it's the simplicity of the game that works and TW doesn't have it. I'm sure this is great for seasoned golf vets, but it doesn't have the simplicity factor of Wii Sports and he doesn't enjoy playing it. Therefore, I can't score it any higher."
5,Great training and lots of fun,"This was my first TW golf game. The training and confidence builders are excellent. They really do help you play a better game. I have only been playing this game about a week but I am loving every moment. The only oddity I found with this game is when selecting player profiles, the game is partial to African-Americans. Aside from not being able to select a blonde ponytail for my player, this game is great!"
5,Fun for the whole family,"Our entire family has really enjoyed this game. It is realistic and entertaining. If you are a fan of golf, it is like having a dozen courses in your own home. I would definitely recommend this game."
4,Great way to live your golf dream,"Let's face it, none of use could compete with Tiger Woods on the real course. But this game gives you the realism of being there on the course swinging the clubs with Tiger. I've been playing this game more than a year and still look forward to playing it every time."
1,no option to use classic controller,"why, oh why, couldn't they give you the option to play the game normally with a classic controller. I bought this game to upgrade from TW 05 for my PS2. The only way to play is to swing the wii remote like a golf club. Sad, because this game is basically the PS2 version transported to the wii. When I want to swing a golf club, IO do it in the real world wit a golf club. When I play video games, I prefer to use my thumbs sitting on the couch. Look, I understand they want to give people who will never set foot on a golf course the feeling of playing real golf, and thats fine, but give us the optiont to use the classic controller as well !!!"
3,08 - 07 - What's the difference?,"I own both the 07 and 08 version of this game and really.... what's the difference? I can spin the ball now - whoopy. Seriously, I'm not thrilled I spent another 50 bucks for a game that is no different than the earlier version. I don't know what some of these other reviewers are thinking but the graphics are THE SAME. Not that I mind the graphics, but there is no difference between appearance in 07 and 08.On top of that, both games have the HORRIBLE interface where you struggle to choose your options.The game is great fun - don't get me wrong. BUT - if you have 07, there's no point in buying 08."
4,"MUCH better than TW `07!!! Finally, a great realistic golf game for the Wii","After being frustrated beyond belief with swing issues in TW `07, EA must've heard me cursing the game one night. 2008 corrects 95% of the glitches in swing from `07, finally giving us another golf game outside Wii Sports that accurately mimics your real swing. If you slice, you'll see it here. Hook the ball, you'll do it on this game. The realism and variety of actuals courses is great :).I hope online play comes next year. Also, be careful putting. I've accidentally hit some weak putts with just the slightest twitch of the wiimote during setup for putting. Not fun to have bogeys and double bogeys on easy holes like the Las Vegas' Falls greens. Otherwise this game is worth it!"
5,Great!!!,Thank you so much for the game it is great!!! I rented it and liked it a lot but no game stores carried it anymore new or used. Thanks!!!
4,Tiger Woods Golf Game,"This game is a lot of fun, but it takes some time to get familiar with all of the features in the game. Having the variety of golf courses to play on is one of the top advantages of this game. It provides the variety needed to keep the game from getting boring. The most frustrating part of the game is creating your character. This should be something that is fun, but is not. The mechanics of it don't work smoothly and the final product is not very satisfactory."
2,Not so much,"As much as I love the New Year's concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic, I can summon little enthusiasm for this particular concert.The orchestra does everything Harnoncourt asks of it, and that's the problem. The result is Strauss et al in an interpretive strait jacket that didn't connect to me when watching the concert b'cast the day of and which seems even more misguided on further hearings.I say the above as one who enjoys Harnoncourt in other rep, like the Beethoven Symphonies, for example.Harnoncourt was the VPO's invited conductor again for the concert of 1/1/2003...and hasn't been back since.Perhaps that now-10-year hiatus tells us something about how the orchestra felt about his two appearances."
2,HK goes downmarket,"It does strange things sometimes, and the latest dissappointment comes when I am playing a DVD, and pressing PAUSE or REWIND causes the amp to reset it's audio mode to 5 CHANNEL STEREO instead of Dolby Digital for no apparent reason. There are many quirky problems like this for me and my HK. It's a shame I'm stuck with it till I can get a new one, which will bear a name rhyming with PONY. I think HK used to be a staunch competitor, but now it seems they just don't put any thought into how users will interact with thier products. This amp is downright confusing, not user friendly, and DEFIANT to my commands. I'm familiar with tech toys, and this is my white whale, elusive. Many functions you will try to make work, and for some grand set of circumstances, they will not. You'll read and read, and discover the answer eventually; ""oh I get it, this will not work unless this is exactly so"" and so on. Simple features become exhaustive, and you will harbor BUYER'S REMORSE. AVOID HK."
1,Not happy,The item I received was not a Hi8 and it didn't even have the correct cords to hook it up to my equipment. I returned it and purchased something from somewhere else.
4,Approachable book to a dry subject (in my opinion),"I thought that Alpers did a good job of explaining the motivation behind 17th century dutch art without being too boring. I'm more of a modernist, so this period tends not to fascinate me.-Matt"
1,dreadfully dull and lifeless,"the author took a fascinating topic and destroyed it by writing in a convoluted, unintelligible fashion--a lot of artistic claptrap, unfortunately--it's like witnessing a stream of consciousness acid trip at the Rikjsmuseum"
4,KLH home theater,"These speakers pack a good punch for the price. Ours were purchased several years ago for a Sony HD television to set up a ""surround sound"" system in the den (about 35' x 35'). They still sound great. For a larger area, an upgraded bass speaker would be recommended."
4,Nice little system,"While the fidelity is not there for a Polk Audio man such as myself, its just fine for my son's (11 years old) movies and video games. Surprisingly good bass from a small sub, decent mids and highs from the satellites. Comes will all the mounting hardware. Comes well packed, even though the box was damaged in shipping all the items inside were fine. Recommended."
4,Better than sony?,"I LOVE music, dvd's, and everything. I had some old speakers, and I needed new ones. I didn't have a whole lot of money, so I looked at some cheaper stuff. I found KLH showing up a lot, I never heard of them untill now. I decided to give them a whirl. I got the speakers, hooked them up, and BOOM was blown away!! The sound was INCREDIBLE!!!! I compared them to a friends very nice sony system, and I think it was better, He paid 3 times what I did, He hated to admitt it, but he aggreed that mine were better. Some people dont think it has a good subwoofer, it was decent, but I added a sub- monster cable, and it can shake my house if I want it to, it is INCREDILBE, it is just a GREAT buy, if you are considering speakers, but dont wanna pay $$$, get these, they ROCK!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I needed a sub- monster cable for it to sound great, cost 20 bucks, but man was it worth it!!!"
4,great buy,Based on value alone...5 stars!Great system to add surround to your system. I like the fact that the satelite speakers are the same as the front. Often the satelites are cheap and lightweight. These seem to be good build quality all around.You cant even buy a powered sub alone for the price of this system.
2,Flick through and Forget flower book,"Being inspired by Jane Packer and Paula Pryke floral decorator books for years I think I have been spoilt and this book by Jeff Leatham, while being beautiful, is not really a flower arrangers book. In actual fact, the flowers play very little part in the actual photography. At times the ""eye catching creations"" (the reviewers comments) could not even be found. Nothing ""genius"" in this book except pretty interiors with flowers on the mantle -sorry Jeff, I will stick with the girls."
1,Won't Play on 360 Pro,"I would love to play this game, but it won't play on my XBox360Pro? I got munch's Revenge(?) at the same time. It's older than the wrath, but it plays on my son's XBox and I'm having a great time with it! Really missed playing it on Playstation."
5,One of the all time greatest,When I picked this gem up I was not expecting to replay it as much as I have. I have probably wasted ten weeks of my life on this game and do not regret it for an instant. A must play for FPS fanatics.
4,Missing something,"It is a great game!I would like to point out everything that isn't great:First voices sound the same for outlaws not a huge problem but still i wish they were slightly more different.Sadly the game could use a little more detail in the graphics.Also the game passes by too quick.I beat almost the whole game in one day with every boss alive!Now for some of the good:Story is a great idea,the jokes might not be origianal but still are super funny.Fantastic setting!The enviroment seems to bring in the real west.Creativity,like the other ones this one has an enourmus amount of creatures and outlaws.Very good voices,I read the credits and it's almost Lorne Lanning who does all the voices.Each voice has a western theme to it.Now for the last thing:Something is missing in this game but i just can't seem to find it.Bottom-Line:Buyit,Buyit,Buyit,BUY IT!"
4,Great game,"Ive always liked the oddworld series. I started with Abes Oddesey on the ps1 and was hooked--good price, great game, why not buy it?"
4,Kid's carpenter's workbook,This book was purchased for my 9 yr old grandson. It's a little hard for him but his dad is a scout leader and he plans to use it with his scouts for different projects. GG
3,Kid's Carpentry Book,The book itself seems like it will be fun. I am looking forward to trying any and all of the projects with any one of my children.
3,Super Reader,"Robocop is another fairly ordinary novelisation, neither particularly good, or particularly bad, so gets the usual sort of rating for that.A Detroit police officer meets a violent end, but there is enough left of him to use his remains as a guinea pig in a cyborg law enforcement trial. His new partner manages to reach him enough that he becomes effective, and more than a robot."
1,Dead or alive - you will not like it,"This book is a wonderful example why tie-ins of action-movies do not work. There is no joy in reading brillantly choeographed action-scenes on the screen in a book. Furthermore, this book is very badly written. Avoid at all cost"
3,small broadhead box,It's a good box but it is small. holds your broadheads secure and has a tray for wrenches but it is small also.
1,Rock/Scissors/Paper on Speed,"If you're looking for something MTG flavored, you should quite frankly look somewhere else. This is a poorly-executed attempt at changing a deep strategy game into a fast-paced game of counters and tactics. It fails. Miserably so.Tactics in this game roughly amount to whether you send your MTG-equivalent of rock, scissors or paper against your opponent's selection. There's no more depth to it than that. To make things even more frustrating, the game requires you mash buttons as quickly and almost indiscriminately as possible in order to match up with the computer's spellcaster. Thus your choice of rock or scissors is largely decided by luck rather than any true strategy. And once you figure out what an opposing spellcaster's bag of tricks contains, there's nothing more to beating him than always countering his attack and attacking his weakness- for every opponent you face is a one trick pony.Nothing to see here folks, move along."
4,Fun for the strategy player!,"This game is interesting, mainly because it is based on a card game, however, it also contains hours of fun. Now... You must understand that it will get a little bit boring when you cannot figure out how to conquer a duelist. Also, be warned... If you are going to purchase this game for the online play, don't. It's not worth it mainly because nobody really plays online, and that takes away a lot of fun. I personally still play this because I play the Magic the Gathering Card Game, and it can be fun. It just looses it's glow once you beat it, mainly becuase there is nothing left to do. Once you beat the game, it's over, and you can't really show off your decks because nobody plays online. Just be warned, it's not going to bring unlimited fun, and sometimes it may not bring any fun at all. ALSO, this game does NOT follow the rules of the Official Card Game."
4,adicting and fun!,if you dont play the card game and you pass by it you probley think thats stupid!Well guess what? this game....ROCKS!!!!!!!!!! but its not like the card game when i looked at some pictures it looked hard but its easy and fun .some levels are hard but you will beat them if....... your not alazy bum that is. well thats my review by
1,Only for online play,"Only buy this game if you love the card game, and want to play online. There are two single player modes -- Quest and Arcade. Both are terrible. Each battle is either extremely easy or extremely difficult -- there's no happy medium. You'll waste hours fighting the same battle over and over again, trying to beat it with the badly designed deck they force you to play, only to finally win and then clear the next 10 battles in fifteen minutes. It's far too frustrating to play, and I can only imagine the limited number of cards won't give it much replay value even online."
1,This game blows me away from buying it,"This game is certainly gonna be $20 pretty soon. If you want this game very badly, it's nothing much to be hyped over because the demo already sucks. This should just be like a happy meal toy from Mcdonalds or something, because I wouldn't give anymore than $5 for this. Probably be collecting dust if I ever bought it."
4,surprisingly good,Engaging. Beautifully shot. Who would expect a hidden message in a werewolf flick?
4,Very nice Eurodance album,"""Return to Paradise"" is the second full album by Imperio after their release of the first successful album called ""Veni Vedi Veci"" (Translated to ""I came, I saw, I conquered""). This new album as the old one has very nice dance music and is very spirited. You will not be able to sit straight and listen to it, you will really want to dance or move around :) One of the best tracks of this CD is ""Atlantis"" which in my opinion is one of the best Eurodance songs out there today. I really would recommend getting this CD."
5,EXCELLENT SOUND AND VALUE!,"I had obtained these KLH speakers locally on sale for about 45 dollars the pair. I have them permanently outside above my patio, mounted under the eave of my house where they are minimally exposed to the elements, except of course temperature. The sound is excellent, and they sound a lot more expensive than they are. Providing your 'source' is good quality (I use a CD player and Yamaha receiver), and your speaker wire is not too thin or long, you will be surprised with the way they sound, and how well made they are. After being outside a full winter, they sound just as good now as they did new! I highly recommend these speakers, especially for outdoor use."
4,Loved these speakers. one just quit working after a year and a half of every night use.,"Loved these speakers. one just quit working after a year and a half of every night use. Plenty loud with most pillows, although on some hotel pillows that were very thick it was a little low. volume control works great. the only complaint is that it only lasted a year and a half but I feel like I got my $20 worth. will buy them again if they are available."
2,Not good for hypnosis cds,"I was not impressed with these speakers. I wanted to use them for self-hypnosis cds, but even at the loudest volume level I could barely hear the speaker's voice. They are probably fine for music, as other reviewers have found, but I would not recommend them if you want to really be able to hear the sound clearly. I purchased these because of the volume control button on the side, but I am returning and will try one of the other pillow speakers on amazon."
3,An expanded & hardcover edition is in print,"This early copyshop-generated generated edition has long been out of print. It's gratifying, of course, to see continued interest over the years, and these older copies may have value for a collector of obscure small editions. However, 776 1/2 was greatly expanded and updated, and new released in a high-quality hard-cover edition:http://www.amazon.com/776%C2%BD-Practical-Ceremonial-James-Eshelman/dp/0970449623/(I'm the author of the work.)"
5,Indo Board,This came fast and as promised. It takes a little getting used to but is great for balance training and core development. The inflatable 'half' ball is safer and actually more of a challange to keep balanced but the roller seems to be give better training for the begginer surfer.I don't think there is anything on the market that can duplicate this product. The quality is excellent.
1,A definate DON'T BUY!,I am very disappointed in Sams Publishing for releasing this book. It is technically inaccurate contrary to what the apporval emblem from Michael Moncur on the back cover says. I would like to see Sams Publishing pull this book off of the shelves. It is very misleading to any programmer. I have been programming PERL for 3 years. Trust me on this one. Get Programming PERL from OReilly and Associates. It is the required PERL resource.
4,A personal yet scholarly informed response to the Psalter,"The last line captures the force of this lovely volume well : ""In short, it is not the psalmists' philosophical acumen but their ability to verbalize cruel and inscrutable pain that make [the Psalms] universally appealing."" This is a heartfelt personal, yet scholarly informed, response to the Book of Psalms by a professor of literature, emeritus. It is well written, lively, forcefully argued and very accessible. It is marred only by the intrusion of an implicit Christian supersessionism that falsely and negatively caricatures the God and values of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible)."
5,The BEST!,I have spent alot of time on my Mozart collection and these performances are the BEST! Perahia's playing is a consistent delight. Try any of the individual CDs if the set is too expensive.
5,chicken stew review,"The students love this book, we usually read it on 100's day, and hide chicks around the room. The students enjoy how the author always makes the prey in her books smarter than the hunters."
5,Cute movie,I ordered this movie on Netflix and it was cute enough that I bought it on Amazon. It was inexpensive and only took a couple of days to get. I am happy with my purchase.
4,Good Family Fun,"Boy was I embarrassed and surprised when the film was over and I found myself saying, ""That wasn't half bad! It kept me entertained. I laughed. And it had a good, strong storyline.""Some critics argue that the side-story dealing with the boys' family life has no place in the film and that might be so, but it in no way distracts from the overall plot of the boys playing private detectives (or sleuths). Since it is, after all, the key ingredient in waking up the father who decides his kids are more important that a bottle of booze and lost dreams."
4,An enjoyable Plumm summer,This is a wonderful and inspiring family story about friendship and coming of age with elements of suspense and mystery( YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT FROG!!) A Plumm Summer may lack the seriousness of other family dramas but nevertheless the performances and storyline are convincing enough to carry you along. This is an exellent family film and I wish there were more like it.
5,A bible to the Mod movment!,"This book is stuffed with detailed information on the Mod culture of the early 60's. The author goes on and on telling whatever he can on what was going on, how they dressed, what they liked, the drugs, the scooters...everything! That's not all of it. That book contians thousands of black and white photographs of the scene (images of the kids danceing, riding and strutin' themselves across the beaches). This book tells the history of mod from it's humble begings to it's sad end in the mid-sixties. I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in Mod. I would also suggest viewing the movie ""Quadrophenia"" for more of an idea of what Mod was."
3,meh,Not his best its a but childish to get into kind of like a young adult book THE SNOW by him is MAGNIFICENT.
4,rather good really,"Overall this system was a charm. The only thing that I was skeptical about when deceiding to buy or not, was that the centre channel has only a 4"" woofer along with a 5/8"" high frequency driver. I didn't know how that would sound with such a small woofer for the centre channel. But it did blend nicely in with the rest of the system, and human vocals really came out with depth and clarity during six channel movies and music. Just remember to add a subwoofer- these speakers don't get below 80Hz. I knew that KLH means quality components and sound, but I bought them anyway even at the low price they are selling for. Good buy, go for it!"
1,waste of money,Bought samsung hc-p4752w tv a week after the one year warranty was up the convergence went Samsung customer service was terrible the insisted this does not happen with their products. Now the tv shuts off by itself all the time I am going to throw it out and NEVER buy anything Samsung again!!!!
1,Fried after 15 months,"Do not buy this model, or for that matter, don't buy Samsung. My set fried 3 months after the warranty expired, and they couldn't repair without a costly service charge and costly parts. Definitely a manufacturer defect, and now it's going out on the street with the rest of the garbage. What a waste of money. I feel like such a fool for buying this brand. I should have read the other bad reviews on this product before I purchased this TV. I hope this writeup is useful and helps someone else out there. At the very least, please research the other internet posts on this brand."
2,samsung can do better,"I have two of these HC-P4752W sets; both purchased in the latter part of '05. Both have served me well, but both have started having focus issues. One TV is way out of convergence when displaying high def input. Non Hi-Def still looks OK. the other one is slightly out of convergence on outer portions of the picture. I expected more reliability out of Samsung. the Auto-Focus feature does not appear to have any positive impact on the issues. Apparently, there is a way to get the TV into service mode using the remote control. Supposedly, in service mode a manual convergence is possible, but I read where other users have problems in this area as well. It seems as if Samsung either poorly designed critical components or simply opted for lower cost/quality parts in their manufacturing. In any case, a TV should last at least 10 years if placed in an ideal environment and not abused. Neither of these appears as if they'll make the 3 year mark."
4,an ease for your brain and fun too,"ok so it isnt a literary work of art, true. but must all books be educational? this is entertaining, hilarious, and reflects my own mishap adventures as a college student. plus, it reminds me of the ""choose your own adventure"" books i LOVED as a kid."
1,A waste of paper and ink.,No character development. No story. No humor. This is trash. I don't understand why this sort of thing gets published and real writers can't get publishers to even look at manuscripts.
2,A little trashy - not for pre-teens,"I used to read ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books as a kid and loved them. I bought this book planning to read through it and pass on to my neices. I think I'll pass on giving this to my neices though because it was a little more trashy than I expected. The book is fun from the choose your own adventure aspect, but it almost encourages drinking binges, sex with strangers, profits from drug deals, etc. I realize its just a book but its not exactly the sort of book I'd want my 12 year old neice to read. Leave this one for adults wanting to relive the memory of choose your own adventure books."
1,Ugh.,"This book couldn't have been more racist, more inappropriate, or more ignorant. Everything touched by Mexican people is either ""greasy"" or ""filthy."" What a great idea ruined by horrible, horrible writing."
4,See down the rabbit hole,"Considering the cost of this unit, I was very pleased with its performance. Good clarity for distance and with the IR light, short range was exceptionally bright. From 30 yards I was able to see a rabbit twitch his nose in a pitch black. I almost felt like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. Get one Clarise Starling....."
1,So dang hard,"The name stands for what I think , Mission is Impossible, I beat the first mission and then the second I tried about 20 times and couldn't beat the first checkpoint!"
2,Threads don't fit properly,"The threads on this didn't fit my old-style valve very well. Because of that it leaked like a sieve. I should have returned it when I had trouble installing it, but I didn't. To remove it I had to break the valve mechanism. I love the idea, but the implementation is poor."
2,Nothing new here,You can find almost all of these ideas online for free. Save your money and spend sometime online researching new ideas.
1,Poor quality,I do not recommend buying this race set. The track is terribly flimsy. The cars do not stay in the grooves at all. The launch pad is very poorly designed.
4,Super fun little solar toys!,"These are great little racers that kids really love. Bought 5 for ""science camp"". Very motivational and has some value in teaching about the angle of sunlight on PV panel. Track is flimsy but seems durable. Only complaint is the track doesn't ""snap"" together well. But this does not seem to hinder the racing and FUN!"
5,Right on!,I'm a dreamer and this book is amazing. It described how I think so well. Very thankful to have read it.
2,Have read better,"I started this book with high hopes, but finished feeling unfulfilled. There are some interesting concepts, but unfortunately these are too widely dispersed amidst the off-putting Christianity-slanted musings of the authors. It took too long to get to the nut and bolts of the book, and by then the authors had lost much of their credibility for me. I don't want to bag it too much, as I'm sure the authors have nothing but helpful intention. And hey, my opinion is just that - only mine. If you have a strong-willed child for whom none of the traditional parenting approaches seem to work, and you don't mind a slap of religion at the same time, then give this book a try."
5,Excellent Read!,"Great book! Easy to read, practical applications and very relevant to my child's needs. I recommend this for parents and educators alike."
3,"Cultural information useful, hotel and rest info lacking","In the past I have used lonely planet guides several times after a trip to Peru in which the guide was absolutely indespensible. Spain, however, is another story. While LP was useful for walking tours and highlighting major attractions, with good museum and monument descriptions, the hotel and restaraunt recommendations were virtually useless. By this I mean that most recommended restaurants were sketchy looking except for the ""expensive"" ones and the hotel guide quoted wrong prices and gives no insight into the hotels. Maybe I hadn't realized that I have outgrown Lonely Planet hotels, but then again maybe un-air-conditioned hotels in 100 degree heat (without fans even) are not worth putting in a travel book. The third world seems to be their purview."
4,The 'Ol Standby,"This book continues the impressively comprehensive and reliable tradition of their namesake. We used this book in conjunction with Rick Steves' and were overall very satisfied, even considering that we were mid-range travellers. LP covers every nook and cranny of the country with thorough and accurate information. The maps are excellent. The commentary is informative. The organization is easy to follow and understand. My main critique is that the book might be too objective: it's often unclear if the guide is actually recommending a restaurant, hotel, or sight, or just merely mentioning that it exists. A ""star"" system to the sights, or a ""don't miss eating here"" section would be helpful. (Try Rick Steves, for example.) Still, the book is a solid, can't-go-wrong pick for an overall guide."
4,A worthy single,"For those of you who have never heard Helloween before, this is an excellent single to get you aquainted with their sound. The title track, ""I Want Out"" is an '80s metal classic which found its way on MTV several times. ""Save Us"" is another great track and both of these songs can be found on the full-length Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II album. ""Don't Run For Cover"" is the b--side that is not included on any of Helloween's full-length studio albums. It is a very good track written by Michael Kiske and it caps off this hard-to-find single."
1,"Dull and turged, flat & unfunny","The humor falls flat, & bored me to tears.I'm a Star Wars fan, but I'm not offended by the humor. I'm offended by the FAILED ATTEMPTS AT humor."
2,shameless rape of the venerable Star Wars saga,"I was appalled by this book--it takes the Star Wars story, especially the underrated prequel and rips it apart from the inside. It's dirty, nasty and pretentious all at once. It claims that the reason why Anakin was so in love with Padme was because she tried to molest him when he was a kid! And it says that Obi-wan was gay and that George Lucas actually stole the idea for Star Wars from extraterrestrial radio waves. To make matters worse, there's lots of smut that's just an obvious attempt to shock the reader and piss Lucas off. I bet Lucasfilm Inc. will sue for copyright violation. They should!"
3,Good overall quality and price!!!,"Good quality, good price...just a lil hard to read and follow...also unfortunately a few glitches in grammar but it was useful for the need...happy for the quick shipping!!"
1,Curious George Goes to School,"Story and graphics were poor. This is just a bunch of screen shots from the curious george movies, and has no real story line. Any of the books that are derived from the movies seem to have similar problems."
5,Archive,"Bit of advise, Before you go out and buy all those cheapy 10th generation Sex Pistol's Live Cd's, all you really need for a good Sex Pistol's music collection is: Nevermind the Bollocks, Spunk, Live at the Winterland, and this Archive Cd. There are a few other good ones like ""Alive"", but these are the 4 best in my opition. Quality is A+ for Archive."
5,Great Camera,"This is truly a great camera, I've had it for a few weeks now and always find a new way to use it even better than before! I've checked to see(on the web)if the camera may have problems that other people have encountered and am happy to see none listed, did not buy extended warrentee. The TRV730 has a better memory stick resolution, but at the expense of the LCD screen (2 1/2) and has a Black and white view finder."
4,It could always be better....,"Great camera, video recording is phenomanal and the 450x zoom is a fun feature not to mention all the cool filter options for recording and editing (solarized, B&W, etc.)... One thing though - it only records photo images resolution with 0.3 megapixels (640 x 480) that's a snapshot and can not really be manipulated on a computer(enlarged) with out revieling excessive pixelation. I reccommend 2.0 megapixel (1600 x 1200) at a minimum, it offers much more room for enlargement and manipulation of the photograph."
5,Must read! Know your history pertinent to today's happenings!,"Must read! Know your history pertinent to today's happenings! Fascism is rampant today and this helps identify why. Look up Prescott Bush, the Business Plot to overthrow FDR, etc."
3,The Boy Who Reversed Himself,"The book The Boy Who Reversed Himself is good book about a girl who gets trapped in a different dimension. I thought it was good, but it's better for a higher reading level. I had a little trouble understanding when they were in the other dimension. The book was interesting aside the parts I didn't understand.This book is good for kids who like to read science fiction books and also for readers who are good at understanding setting changes. This is a very interesting book that will be hard to put down. I would give this book a 7 out of 10."
5,Love this series,Paul Doherty knows how to write a good series of this time period. Read them all. Thinking of trying to real Canterbury Tales....
4,The english correct way of 60s-soul-punk rock,Just listen to this powerfull trio band. This are all their singles and sounds really great.
5,A great sounding reissue,"I won't repeat all the lavish praise of previous reviews, but rather emphasize a couple of things. First, the sound quality on this set is *much* better than the previous Polydor (U.S.) individual album masters I own. This really helps recapture the impact of the Jam's crunchy power-trio sound that I remember from the original 45's. Second, a lot of the non-album material that I haven't heard for a while sounds quite good and fresh -- not just ""Going Underground"" but also singles like ""Beat Surrender"" that back in the early 80s seemed not quite up to standards."
2,Not so great cleaning up!,I find this vac doesn't do such a great job picking up on the first or second pass.
1,I Tried....,"I read all the reviews.And even the director defending his movie,and stating all the awards this movie,and or actors were nominated for.( I was even cheering him on).But man,this movie is just plain terrible.And Im not trying to be rude or go along with the other comments.I really wanted to like this.Theres REALLY nothing to like about this movie,aside from the cover art."
3,It was worth a sitting...but not a second sitting,"but if you are expecting a ""Ghost Hunters"" type film, forget it. One good thing is they show a flash light that worked by remote control that made me wonder if the real ""Ghost Hunter's"" show doesn't do that!The acting was good. The story was really good in a few parts, but didn't go where i thought it would. It just wasn't scary enough for me. When there were some real chills to be had like the shapes in the basement, it turned a different direction more towards a slasher film.I was a good film to watch once, but it's not really what it makes itself out to be, which was a little disappointing."
2,Low budget... and it shows,"This is another small budget film that will never make it big. It had potential - as most ghost stories do - but it wasn't scary at all and the storyline was only so-so.*SPOILER* The gas leak explanation for everyone's halucinations undermined the whole premise of a ghost story and left the viewer confused. The bracelet and pendant got us back on track but by then it was too late. I already felt cheated because the movie was pretty much over. I guess that was intended to leave us questioning whether it really was all about the gas leak. For me, it seemed like a clumsy way of tying up an already weak storyline.It's a good movie for small budget, I guess, as long as your expectations are realistic. If I were the person who wrote this story, I'd be thrilled to see it on screen. He won't make his millions off it, though, which is disappointing."
4,Ghost Don't Exist,I liked the movie alot. The actors were beginners and did a good jobI am very excited for them. Maybe there will be some new actors in our future.
2,Not what I thought it was going to be,I bought this thinking that it was going to be in documentary form. What this is is a cheezie movie with cheezie actors and plot line. I do not recommend this DVD.
5,BLACK METAL AT IT'S BEST,"Varied and brutal album. Grand cold atmospheres and topics deal with war, hate and nationalism. ""Suomi Finland Perkele"" got banned in France for it's content. This is found in every true Black Metal'ers collection."
1,"(Less than 1 star) very poor quality, not as pictured",Not worth the price.Hinges are loose due to stripped screw holes.Overall structure is not as pictured - top is not the tray top as pictured but flat.Front painting/design is not as pictured (and scratched).Front drawer pull installed crooked.Paint on inside drawers has been scraped by hardware inside doors.I am expecting a complete refund as this is not what was ordered.
5,As good as Sibelius gets!!,"I've owned several recordings of these pieces, and by far these are the best Sibelius performances on CD that I know of. The woodwinds and brass of the P.S.O. are particularly impressive. The 1st movement coda of the 5th Symphony is a real heart-stopper! I would recommend buying the entire set of Sibelius Symphonies with Maazel and the Pittsburg Symphony."
2,Not a must have,"A good reference book on fabrics has good close up images of the fabrics it refers to, there is just one in this book (page 99). The others are very bad photos of designed garments by students that do not show in depth the quality of the fabrics. The information provided on the fabrics is good but it is really not illustrated."
3,introductory and elementary. great for first timers and youngsters.,"This book is excellent as a first venture into the history of the bible. If you've already read a few things, this will be quite remedial. gives just enough information to intrigue, and makes you want to investigate further. Easy to read in one sitting. Excellent for scholarly kids/teens, and adults who know nothing about the subject.The bible didn't just fall out of the sky in its present form, all ready to go,--this book is for those who thought it did or have never thought about it at all."
5,"Wonderful Voice, Great Selection","This is one of the best vocal CDs released in the last several years. If you don't know Susan Graham's gift, this CD is the best introduction. I'd also recommend it if you're not especially an opera fan, but are interested in a very listenable introduction to top-notch singing. I've listened to this over and over, and have not filed the CD away for months.The balance of material between Gluck and Mozart works surprisingly well. Graham eschews the showy and flashy, yet sings with extraordinary power and passion. The accompaniment is excellent, never getting in the way. The recording is almost perfect.In short, a pleasurable CD that will improve the quality of your life."
3,Extremely competent but not a permanent addition,"Very well-focalized, and an evenly produced sound (granted, there is no special color, nor low register) --- but the problem is the anonymous quality of the interpretations. If you want to truly understand Iphigenie's predicament in her aria 'O malheureuse Iphigenie', seek Janet Baker. Not a generalized torment beautifully sounded -- but a moment of tormented grandeur."
2,Bland & Sleepy,"I enjoy Susan Graham in performance and on CD (her Ned Rorem CD is excellent). This time I was disappointed by the bland and nearly featureless impression this left me with. It is pablum start to finish to my ears. And too...her weak lower register is exposed unflatteringly in this repertoire.For a study in opposites, try Ewa Podles in the same repertoire and buckle yourself in for the ride."
1,Don't waste your money.,"If you really want a good comfort food cookbook, I recommend Rachel Ray's -- don't waste your money on this one."
5,every recipe i've tried in this book has been great,folks i have a lot of cookbooks (like a bookcase full) and there are a few i really use alot of comfort foods being one of then rita harris'recipe for standing rib roast has come out perfect every time i've used it i used alot of recipes from this book during the recent holidays when we had out of town family in and they were so impressed that they want a copy of the book
1,Offended by the author,"I was offended by Ms. Harris' posting on Rachel Ray's book also entitled ""Comfort Foods"". If Ms. Harris is so concerned about other authors using the title of ""Comfort Foods"", she should change the title of HER book as Better Homes and Gardens published a book entitled ""Comfort Foods"" 4 years PRIOR to Ms. Harris' publication. Get a life, Ms. Harris. Your comments will assure me that I will never purchase a book you have written."
4,"Great series. Fantastic graphic art here! DVD compilation, please!","This series of documentaries from Disney was one of the most well-illustrated volumes on Dinasaurs made back then. I vividly recall the informative, fun, yet creepy ways the makers of these shows added sounds and moved each scene from one spot to the other. The interviews with the experts were well done too. It's retro by todays standards, in the age of computer-generated scenes and cross-sections. The main thing that stood out, though, were the detailed art works that vividly showed how remarkable these creatures were. The artist gives each diansaur a personality and a knowing look for each one. It was just a good series that helped get me into History and the graphic arts.Disney should put out this entire series on DVD."
4,Very Helpful Guide,"I've been hiking in the Santa Monica Mountains for most of my life, and found this guide helpful in finding many trails and trailheads that I never knew existed. This book is a great starting point in planning hikes, but the trail maps are too cruely drawn and vague to warrant taking it on the trail. Never the less, after reading the description of the trail, and familiarizing yourself with the map, you should be safe. Most of the hikes are pretty tame.The back of the book is a detailed guide to the Backbone Trail, which is a treasure to Los Angeles County. Get the most out of the Santa Monica Mountains and buy this guide."
4,Great for finding new trails,"This book has been a wonderful resource for finding new trails that we never knew about, practically right in our own backyard. This book really is extremely comprehensive. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that on occasion, he doesn't give enough details when giving directions (either driving to the trail, or in details about the hike itself)."
2,Does not make sense,"I have read this book 5 times (literally) and I still find it puzzling. For one, the description of Rickie's symptoms are not consistent with schizophrenia, so it's unclear how she ever received that diagnosis in the first place. Second, the notion that the use of prism glasses and ""vitamin therapy"" can ""cure"" schizophrenia is preposterous and is in direct contrast to sicentific studies that have implicated excessive dopaminergic activity. This book depicts an unrealistic ""recovery"" and provides false hope to those who truly have a mental disorder."
5,Alahoyus Brollums.,"Valient Thorr is one of the best bands I have ever come across. I'm am infinitely glad that they crashlanded here on Earth on their way from Venus. They are keeping the classic, face-melting metal/rock'n'roll alive. They are our generation's MC5 with their messages but the music is more reminiscent of Maiden and Thin Lizzy. They are in your face and have cajones like none other. Valient himself is a preacher and his sermon has the best message ever, ""I will die for rock'n'roll."" Get a bucket for your face because Eidan and Odinn are ready for the rock. and lastly but certainly not leastly, Nitewolf and Lucian make the a brutal, pounding rhythm section. If you like rock and roll and metal and you just need something to really thrash around to, then Valient Thorr is the band for you. They prove that Rock'n'Roll CAN and WILL save the world. It's just a matter of time. Listen, learn, and first and foremost, rock out."
3,Really Outdated,My kids are enjoying the use of this book for our homeschool lessons. It does require me to take some time out to explain some things though. Mainly because it makes mention of VCRs and Walkmen and my kids don't know what either of those things are. Other than that it's a really good book and they're learning a lot from it.
3,Not the best de phazz,"Natural Fake and Death by Chocolate are by far better than this. If you want to put it in a five disc changer with the others, it will make your play list longer, but water the quality down. As with anything else, if you have money to blow, go ahead. If you are trying to be a bit eclectic with your music and want to be frugal, skip it."
4,Good Storage,I like this storage solution but the only gripe i have is when you fill this cube up on both sides of the sleeve it gets a little tight in there. other that that great product
5,Perfect I love this system.,"FIRST THERE WERE VHS TO DUST CONSTANTLY AND ALTHOUGH DVDS TAKE UP LESS SPACE; YOU STILL HAVE TO DUST THE CASES. THIS SYSTEM HOLDS EIGHTY AND MY COLLECTION FIT IN FIVE OF THEM. NOW INSTEAD OF FOUR SHELVES TO DUST; I HAVE ONE AND EVERYTHING IS SAFE AND ENCLOSED. GREAT VALUE, GREAT COMPANY TO DEAL WITH AND WOULD DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN."
4,Good.....,"It's been awhile, I thought I had reviewed it and now can't remember much of it. I read fast but I finished it, so it must have been pretty darn good! Sorry I can't recommend it since my memory is bad...."
4,This has a really good plot.,"The author does a good job at keeping the readers interest and guessing who the culprits are.If you like horses, you'll find this interesting. Would have given this book 5 stars if the author had left out the cussing and sex scene. That I did not find pertinent to the plot."
4,Awesome book,This was a awesome book. I loved the plot and characters. I also love horses so that made it even better
3,A good read,Thrilling all the way to the end! I just wish all the cussing could have been left out. But a good book over all.
4,At Risk,"Very good story. Enough twists and turns to keep my interest. Although I am not familiar with horse farms or how they work, the author's descriptions made me feel like I was there. Look forward to reading more Steve Clone Mysteries. Would definitely recommend this book."
4,At Risk,I felt that the maturity shown by a 21 yr. old a bit much. But I enjoy most anything to do with horses.
4,Not quite Dick Francis,"I found myself comparing Ehrman to Dick Francis whom I find absolutely sublime and thought the book lacked some character development. Also, the crudity of the sex descriptions left something to be desired, but then we are watching a 20-something young man too, something to keep in mind. The plot read well, the book was well-organized and had a good pace. I found the descriptions of the horses and barns right on and there's a certain amount of understanding about horses that shines through. A good, quick read."
4,Good Read,A good entertaining read. It flows well and keeps the reader interested. No bad for a freebie. I would read this author again.
2,It's ok,"Not my kind of book. Some people might find it interesting other than myself, it's ok. Did not keep me in suspense."
3,Just So So,"I wanted to like this book. It wasn't badly written, at least for the first few chapters. But it sort of falls apart about halfway through and never pulls out of the tailspin. It redeems itself by the end, but not enough to make up for the low points. Could have been good, turned out just so so."
2,"Title also has some ""At Risk"" for readers","I only read a few chapters of this book before closing it. Anyone who is young or they have certain values, this wouldn't be something to read. I didn't enjoy it because of the swearing. Things can still be as good in life without the swearing, sexual references, etc. It's just who I am and what I choose read. Otherwise, for what I read it was good so far."
5,Don't risk missing this book!,"If you have missed the annual arrival of a new Dick Francis mystery each year as much as I have, then maybe you will as pleased as I am with the debut novel, At Risk, by Kit Erhman. The style is very similiar. The story is fast paced. The characters and setting are so vivid that I can picture them in my mind. The author definitely knows horses and the horse business. I enjoyed Steve Cline, the protanganist, and am looking forward to reading the next book. I am hoping his relationship with Rachel proceeds. There are a few individuals in the cast of characters that I would like to see more of and a few that i would like to see get what they deserve! Read it and see for yourself."
2,Not enough action,While this book was well written and starts off well it bogs down after a few pages. I found myself skimming through page after page of nothingness trying to find out why I started reading the book. Somewhere in the the middle of the book he throws in graphic sex that has nothing to do with the plot. Not worth the time it takes to read.
4,Good read that encourages the reader to think,"Generally well written story - with the exception of the sex scenes; they add nothing to the story. Really. The book would have been just as good (better, actually) without them. The basic premise of the story, that of the protagonist being a 21-year-old college dropout is a bit of a stretch, considering the position of authority he's been placed in, but otherwise it's a pretty good read. Plenty of suspense, intrigue and subplots that finally lead the reader to the conclusion."
2,This is a 2 1/2 star at best,"I love books about the horse industry and decided to try this one. It mostly consisted of filler detail, not much about the horses or even much character development. I hate it when I finish reading a book and feel like I have wasted my time. I felt obligated to get on amazon.com and give it a review because of the 4 star rating this book has."
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in this book. I didn't care for the cursing or the sex in it. I enjoy a good mystery but I don't need to read curse words or read about people having sex. I thought it would have more about horses in it. The plot was mediocre. I wouldn't recommend this book.
5,4 vintage cartoons!,"This VHS contains Wolf! Wolf!, Christmas Comes But Once A Year, Porky's Railroad, Timid Toreador. Not all are Mighty Mouse."
1,didn't last 30days,I bought this TV for my small office. I had it installed with the elbow mount so patients could watch tv while waiting for appointments. After a couple of weeks the screen went gray and with in another two weeks it went out completly. I wouldn't recomend it.
3,Could have done better,"This book leaves you hanging, but not exactly thirsting for more. I would read the sequel, which is non-existant to my knowledge, but only out of frustration.In a way, there was some kind of more grown-up, Harry Potter-type of quality to this book. Then things end up going all to hell, and people drop like flies, but there's no closure. I expected more of some characters.What could have been, was not. It's not a bad book, but certainly fails to deliver."
2,READS TOO MUCH LIKE A GAME!,"I usually love Mel Odom's novels but this one - though promising - was just set too much like a game more than a well written novel. There were quite a few interesting characters but the plot was just not there and the background feel was like a game. Now I know its based on a game - but does it have to read like one! Mel Odom writes at his best in the OUTLANDERS novels he writes on occasion, that seems to be his medium and genre and when he is at his best."
1,for Die hard JY fans only,"Im a huge must have anything styx ever recorded fan, so even though I've never been big on JY, I felt he added variety and a certain flavor to the group. I bought his solo albums for the sake of completing my collection rather then enjoyment. I do like one song 'waiting' very much and 'Still feel your love' is prety good, but everything else is not my cup of tea. It should please the JY styx fans though."
4,J.Y.'s only ballad Still Feel Your Love belongs on any Styx cd,"This is actually probably J.Y.'s most consistent solo album and it's actually pretty good. Of course, one has to take into account the era in which it was made. This was the 80's and guitar hard rock and metal were the norm. While J.Y.s two heavy songs on his Raised By Wolves cd are probably his best heavy songs (and compare really well with his Styx material), songs on the City Slicker album like Wild Dogs in the Night and Still Feel Your Love are standouts among other good songs. In fact, his only sung ballad in his history with or without Styx, ""Still Feel Your Love"" fits really well on any Styx iPod collection and is a great song."
2,They come apart :(,"I simply wanted a pair of medium sized silver earrings. I was tired of purchasing the cheap ones from the kiosks or pharmacies which would lose their shape after a few wears. Once I received these I was even happier as the post slides into the hoop so you don't have to deal with clasps which won't catch or if they do catch, pinch your ear for that split second. Unfortunately, I believe the cheap ones would have been preferable. Note: These are VERY THIN hoops; the posts which slide into the hoop? great concept unfortunately, mine keep sliding back out. So every time I wear these hoops, by mid-day I have to search my office for a silver hoop(s) as the post has become undone on one or both. Not impressed. On the up-side though, it appears to be a very good silver."
1,Not complete,"Obviously, this single disc does not contain the complete music to Sleeping Beauty, if it is as advertised an audio CD."
2,Sappier than syrup,"What else can I say? This book was nearly unbearable. Seriously. From beginning to end, the author spends page after page so immersed in poetic metaphors to show how gifted he is (sorry, that's the impression I got) and how glorious his life as a writer has been that there's hardly any space left for the useful information I was hoping to find in this book. I felt him pushing, forcing his readers to be inspired rather than inspiring his readers. Yes, I was inspired at first, for a moment, but that soon faded. The constant bragging about his ASTONISHING talent and dedication (though I think that what he sees as dedication, such as writing 1000 words a day since the age of 22, is more of a compulsion) got old by the time I was done with the first of a dozen essays. There are some nuggets of wisdom here and there, but the syrup-soaked rhetoric the readers must endure to find these tiny treasures isn't worth reading the book, if you ask me."
5,Classic book for anyone interested in writing,"This is one of the best books I have ever read on the process of writing. Not the mechanics but the more important tasks such as story ideas, practice, etc. I have bought this book numerous times throughout the years as gifts for anyone interested in writing."
4,Handy Writer wisdom,"What I like about this book is that I feel as if Ray Bradbury is talking to me across the table over a cup of coffee helping me, a writer, hone his craft. The collection of essays and articles over a lifetime of writing provides an evolutionary perspective that is inspirational and instructive.This is not a book about craft, it is about the heart. Ray shares his heart and helps the reader, if he is a writer, tap into his own complex history of impressions, experiences, successes and disappointments. By teaching the writer how to ""mine"" their past, Ray helps him or her to imagine a different future and thus provide rich creative fuel. I am glad I bought the hardcopy and will have to soon buy the kindle version because I will soon wear out the pages."
2,Not a good ending to a series.,"""The 80'S and 90's: Power Dressing to Sportswear"" is the last book in the ""20th Century Fashion"" series, and somewhat of a disappointment, but perhaps because it was researched in the 1990s, when fashion was still changing. Still, the 80s fashion section was OK, but again, not the best. I do not recommend."
3,Verry nice job Scot,"All I can say is WOW! This is an excellent book! An author of fantasy myself, I know a best seller when I read it, and this is one is well on it's way to that goal.Very well written, with many twists and turns that left me wondering what was going to happen next, but not able to guess at what it would be.The characters, creatures, and details of the story are vividly brought to life, playing as I read the pages, like a movie in my mind. I found myself reading well into the morning several times, not wanting to put it down. Then forced but the late hour to do so, but lay with the story still running through my mind.This is one of the best fantasy books I have read in a while. Again Nice job, I can't wait for the sequel to come out.James Berry"
3,Somewhat uneven entry in the Mojo series,"But there are still some gems here. It feels a bit less soul and latin oriented than others. Still worth your time if you can find a reasonably-priced copy. And yes, your eyes are not deceiving you on Track One.01 Sunshine Of Your Love Ella Fitzgerald02 Solar Level Johnny Almond Music Machine03 Young Generation Dakota Staton04 Mano Caetano Maria Bethania05 Ponteio Edu Lobo06 Hold Me, I've Got To Leave You Jonny Teupen07 On Broadway Jess Roden08 Guru - Vin' Don Sebesky09 Cinnamon And Clove Lee Evans10 Tema Rio 65 Trio Rio 6511 Troublemaker John Cameron12 Hair Galt MacDermott13 Bat Macumba Gilberto Gil14 Woman, Woman Johnny Bristol15 California Soul The Gimmicks16 Move Your Hands La Clave17 Revelation Charles Earland18 Season of The Witch Julie Driscoll"
3,not impressed,"This backpack took longer to arrive than anything i've ever ordered through amazon. It was much smaller than I'd expected. In fact, a regular sized folder will not fit comfortably in the backpack. It looks like a backpack a preschooler would carry. I returned this item due to the size, and I'll have to say, I received my refund faster than I did the product itself- not sure if that's good or bad. I don't recommend this backpack for use as a school bag for any child, the size just isn't there."
2,Okay but could have been better!,"As a huge ""Friends"" fan,I own both books and all possible memorabilia related to the show.I prefer the official guide rather than this unofficial guide because this book contains info that most ""Friends"" fans like myself already know.But this book should be of interest to those who do not know much about the show and those who have only begun liking the show."
5,A must have for software business managers,"Software Process Improvement has often only been considered from the technical perspective. You could find hundreds of books on how to improve the quality of your reviews but very few on how much it would cost you. Whether you hold a MBA, MSc, or just need to find out more on the economical aspects of SPI this book is for you.I have successfully used many of Mr. Rico's concepts and models to calculate ROIs for different implementations of a project assessment methodology."
1,Hard to Recommend,"Not a good book. No index. No bibliography. The book begins with some poor overviews of what we mean by ROI and what we mean by Software Process Improvement. It then goes on to give very detailed descriptions of how the author chooses to measure ROI for several major SPI approaches. He then goes on to cite cost and benefit numbers coming out of his calculations. Based on these numbers, he makes some pretty strong conclusions about the relatively high cost and relatively low benefits of most of the major SPI approaches in use today. His overall agenda seems to be to convince people that most SPI efforts are too expensive and not worthwhile (which is in stark contrast to the claims made for the book in the foreword by Roger Pressman, where he says the book will help you justify continued funding for SPI). His final conclusion is that we should minimize the costs of SPI and maximize the benefits -- not something I needed a $50 book to help figure out."
1,Not very realistic,"This book is full of assumptions and not very realistic. SPI requires awareness and commitment, training and a long breath. Putting numbers together has done in this book is not what we are looking for."
5,A first of a kind ...,The world of software process improvement (SPI) was in great need for a book like this. This book will pay for itself by saving you the effort to develop your own return on investment (ROI) case for to convince your management to invest in SPI. It will open your eyes to the value of SPI. David has been working on this book for several years. So I recommend you buy the book to benefit from his research and effort.
2,ok for a beginner,"Its been about 15 years since ive picked up a clarinet. I wanted to see if i could still play. This clarinet is ok for a beginner, meaning if your child knows how to play and is serious, then this is NOT the clarinet for you. However its a good Starter clarinet and you cant beat the price.It sounds nice for what it is.The body doesn't come apart very easy no matter how much cork greese you use, And the edges where you put it together are sharp so it scratches and cuts the corking. I had to file some of the plastic edge's where you connect the parts to stop that from happening.Ive had it for about 1 week and have already bought another professional clarinet and i will prob give this away to one of my nieces or nephews to mess around with...This was ok and only good enough to see if i could still play and read music... LOL"
4,What a nice surprise!,"This was in a stack of cd's I had bought in the $1 and $2 bins from used music stores, and I wasn't expecting much. But I was EXTREMELY surprised.Yes, very much like Stone Roses, but different. Really nice. A good find. I don't know if I could shell out $36 for it, but I would certainly pay more than the $1 I did pay for it!"
2,replacement battery,"battery came look like new, but after full charged run time less than my old battery (3 years )"
5,Very Good System,"I wanted a home theater speaker system but didn't want to spend alot of money. I am very glad I purchased this system. I compared these speakers with many others and they sounded as good as any I listened too. If you want a great system without paying big bucks for it, then these speakers are for you. I cannot think of anything to complain about and I plan on purchasing another set for a second TV room in the near future."
3,Just ok...,"Ordered this chair after reading good reviews about it. But when assembled it - was kind of dissapointed. Fabric for chair itself - kind of cheapy. So far didn't have to clean it - but afraid that it is going to be a hassle. I had old Peg-Perego chair, and it needed to be replaced. Buckle on the Combi is very thin and not as easy to open and close. It does requres two hands to take or put tray. Toy is not bad, but once you put it, it is hard to take off. My 11 month old likes it.. and for right now I will just keep it on. The second tray is really easy to push.. REALLY EASY>..My baby keeps taking it off when he is grabbing the toy. So, I wish I would just spend more money and buy either Avalon High chair or Peg-Perego..I think even Fisher Price chair is much better. But the chair is already assembled and I am not going to take it down and return.."
4,Good product,"Bought this for my new grandson--works great, he loves the toy, really helps entertainment issue while preparing food. Only downfall, is not ""one hand"" tray operation."
3,"A fine book, but -","I would agree with comments above from other reviewers. This provides a very well written and superbly documented perspective on a ""new"" Romanov. The histories of the tsars can tend to be a bit reptitious.Disappointment in the Grand Duke or ""White Crow"": While he is different than others, he is still an Imperial Romanov with all of the accompanying trappings and weight that pulled this house down. The times may be of more far more interest than the life.Book production shortcomings: If ever a family tree would be useful, it is for this book. And how about a few more photos on quality paper? No dustcover. For the amazingly high price, this is a poorly produced book. Is the demand that low?A fine book for those with a deep interest in pre-revolutionary Russia. This is not a book, as well done as it is, for the newer student of Russian history."
5,Ileana Cotrubas and Placido Domingo cast their usual spell.,"The chemistry between Ileana Cotrubas and Placido Domingo is particularly present in this wonderful recording of Charpentier's Louise. Cotrubas never sounded more radiantly beautiful as her creamy soprano expresses Depuis Le Jour, and her obvious intelligence and artistic refinement make this recording the essential Louise. Domingo sounds heroic and, as ever with Cotrubas, sings the role of the ardent lover with utter conviction. Simply the best."
2,Not as pictured--poorly wrapped,"Received a box that rattled loudly. Inside were 2 jars and 2 lids, They were not packed/sealed in an Oster-brand box as shown. There was not any padding to protect the jars and lids at all. Seems like they may be selling used items as new, or knock offs."
2,"Cheap plastic back, toy-like look and feel","I bought this watch before Christmas at the price of $30 from amazon.com for three reasons - 1. My old watch was broken and I don't want to use my cell phone as a watch. 2. I thought it will be cool to wear an atomic watch that can adjust its time automatically by using time adjustment radio. 3. CASIO is a decent brand, CASIO watches should have a better construction when compared with TIMEX watches.I was totally disappointed when I received the watch from amazon.com - The watch doesn't look or feel right. The front watch dial looks more like a toy watch than a serious watch. The ""stainless steel"" case and watch bracelet are misleading - the back cover of the watch is plastic and the watch is much much lighter than the weight of a normal stainless steel watch. I guess a major portion of this watch was made by plastic.Please refer to the pictures I uploaded for details."
2,Not Good....,Waveceptor doesnt work properly... It doesnt get in-sync with new daylight savings and you dont even have a knob to manually correct it... The watch I bought is just of no use to me now.. I would have to return it to casio for repairs
3,"Pretty good, but...","I was looking for a watch with digital date and analog hands. Kind of hard to find, but the WVQ140 fit the bill. Nice silver watch with expansion band. Instruction sheet is three full 8.5x11 pages, but still not clear on some things. For three days, I struggled to get the hands to agree with the digital time, then found how to do it. Once that was done, it also did the auto updating. Anyway, it does what I want, so I'm OK with it. But the setup is not straightforward."
5,Does what it says it will,"I wanted an inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time. This fills the bill quite nicely. It sets itself daily and even uses WWV's ""leap year"" flag so you don't have to worry about the Daylight Savings time change.It is a bit fussy here in Pittsburgh (hill country). It took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal. It instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the ""six"" on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes.I followed the manual instructions several times. Then I picked up the watch right after I initiated the manual search for the signal. I moved it around until it showed a steady ""3"" (highest signal level). Problem solved.Adjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin, etc. Except it require brute force. I broke a jeweler's screwdriver and small punch in the process.I should have bought an expansion band at the same time."
5,great shoulder rest,"After 20 years of use I just bought my second one. Reliable, comfortable and relatively durable. The feet do wear down after a few years of use and the pad after 20 years of use has also worn down though still usable. It is nice because the Wolf is made from metal which makes it quite strong yet looks slim. I have used dozens of other shoulder rests over the years and I still go back to this one because of the price and performance. Only thing to watch out for are the feet because the rubber will wear faster than the other parts. Over all I am very satisfied."
3,Swivels even when you don't want it too,I dislike the fact it swivels on its own putting adjustment offPops off easilyLike the length adjustment processBetter for wider shoulders
2,Poor quality,"When I received the Wolf Forte Secundo shoulder rest, it had a faulty weld/solder on one side and was unusable. I purchased this product because it was supposed to work well for people with longer necks. I returned the shoulder rest and kept my Kun shoulder rest which is much more durable. My husband simply increased the height of my current shoulder rest by using two couplers and two additional 8-32 brass screws. (The cost was a mere $3.00 for the retrofit.)"
2,fan blade arms,"It was wrong size, I returned it to vendor. Have not received any credit at this time. Please check."
2,Elevation information wildly inaccurate,"We were looking for a ride that was very flat due to an injury. We chose the 61 mile covered bridge loop from Brownsville, which according to the book rose gradually from Brownsville (el. 320) to an elevation of around 500 feet, and then gradually back to Brownsville, for a total elevation gain of a few hundred feet.The actual max elevation on the ride turned out to be 1145 feet, with a total elevation gain on the route of 2096 feet. The author did not even mention the uphill grade on gap road, which was quite challenging for us given it was on miles 55057 and rose from 340 to 740 feet.Personally I doubt whether the author even did this route in a car, let alone a bicycle."
2,Lots of good roads missed,"This guide, like all the Falcon ride guides, does a nice job of describing a series of pretty good rides, but inexplicably ignores lots of great ones. You wouldn't have a bad time doing these rides, but you'd miss the best riding in the state. This is true of every Falcon guide I've ever used, road or mountain, and I can't explain it--the great rides aren't exactly secrets. Word of mouth, websites, or local bikeshop advice is always better."
1,Not for every literary buff.,"Manual, yes certainly manual labour is involved. I can acknowledge the intentions of Perecs structuring intellectually but was unable to translate this into an emotive or pleasurable response. The tone is distant and although the detail would suggest realism it is all just a pretext for a two dimensional jigsaw puzzle. Perhaps this is what you are seeking but such antiseptic games are not for me. It lacks both the humanity of Ulysees or the pure romance of The Flanders road to seek two books of comparable difficulty."
4,Fascinating,"Yes, it's a good read and structurally moving with a near perfect match of form and content. Yet it is no where close to Joyce who still reigns supreme."
2,disapointment,"Now I don't want to mislead, some of you will love this book. I bought it on the strength of an ""extra good"" review. A lot of reviewers loved the book. If you are looking for a long drawn out romance with a lot of C.J. Cherryh trying to come up with how an older man might think when falling in love with a younger woman (let me save you the quandry...so far as Ms. Cherryh goes men apparently never think with any part of our bodies higher than our mis-section. He even contemplates ""forcing"" this woman he ""cares for"", for her own good naturally.)The reviews talked about cjatacter development, mostly I spent the book being annoyed. I finished it and it right to my ""trade pile. The one thing I can't do here is say who will like it and who won't, wish I could. For me, I was looking forward to getting it based on the reviews I'd read only to be disappointed in it.My suggestion? Read the other reviews and consider before ordering."
3,Not bad.,"A fascinating story set in an oriental culture.The beginning was better then the ending though. When they're on the mountain it's a rather touching story of two people working together. Then the character development peaks half way through and it becomes a rather standard adventure story.The first part, was great. It had serious life.The second part felt a little forced. Like the author couldn't decide how to match the first part and just sort of rushed through it. It's passable but it pales in relationship to the first part."
5,simple and effective,it works great! soft to handle!! but hard enough for the strings!!!shipping in timeeverything fine!!!!thanks
4,Super,Muy comodo para usar. Mi guitarra es acustica pero este puente me gusta mucho mas que los que habia probado. Facil de poner y quitar con una mano sola.
5,It's an island oasis...,"Cruisin' envelops the listener in the cool, tropical breeze of an exotic paradise as Marc takes the listener on an auditory journey that showcases his love for Latin and European music. To listen to Cruisin' is much like being on vacation on a sunset island beach, discovering a vista where Marc's guitar describes the sights and sounds in beautiful detail. His melodies are warm, soothing, and dreamy, as on 'Sierra Bella', 'On the Strip', and 'Indian Summer', while others such as 'Mas Que Nada', Cruisin', and 'Fuego' really fuel and refresh the soul, exhilarate, and balance out the mood. Cruisin' is more than music: It's a personal experience. Marc, thank YOU for sharing your personal best with your fans and as always for successfully transcending all barriers through your music. Thank-you so much for the mention on your liner notes. I am humbled and deeply honored to be your #1 fan por siempre!"
5,A real grower!,"Every time this CD gets played I like the tracks more, all are excellent. The CD has a slightly different feel to it than his previous releases, probably due to the greater use of live musicians. The title track 'Crusin' has the familiar Marc Antoine sound and it will be a clear favourite for the radio, but there is also plenty of variety here. The excellent 'Fuego' is on the Jazzier side of smooth. 'Indian Summer', with it's retro sounding keyboard & smooth vocals, is one for those chilled out moments. Another excellent track with slightly retro sounding keyboard is On 'The Strip'. Keyboards have been used to great effect through out this CD and they have complimented Marc Guitar playing well. I rate this CD as equal to Marc's excellent previous releases but the style is perhaps a little less innovative than his last CD, Universal Language."
1,I Wish I Had Read the Other Reviews...,"I wouldn't have bought this book If I had. Sometimes buying books online is really a mistake. Had I been able to flip through this book in a book store, I would not have bought it!My first shock was the style/type of print. My impression was that this was a kids book! The type is large and weird looking. Second; most of this book is taken up by pages and pages of code. There is hardly ANY hardware coverage/examples at all. After flipping through the pages (having only had the book 10 minutes), I became disgusted and threw it on my bookshelf - never to be looked at again!I was planning on buying all of the pic'n series; however, now I am not so sure.Buy a book by John Iovine instead. I have two of his books and both of them are outstanding...Stay AWAY from Myke Predko books also..."
2,"Book is 99 % software, 1 % hardware -not an applicat guide !","The book gives detailed code for some fairly trivial and some reasonably complex apps. Looks like its geared to hobbiest, I normally expect that a good application guide should be a better balance of software and hardware."
4,Straight and to the point.,"David Benson has written a book that is full of MPASM examples that can be used as is or modified to fit your needs. The book is good for intermediate and beginners that are still struggling with learning PIC assembly. I would have liked to see the 17Cxxx series covered in this book. He does a good job of describing the the 12Cxxx series as well as some of the mid-range PICs. He does a great job of covering PC to PIC communications! Overall, this book makes a GREAT addition to my reference library. Good job David!"
2,To behonest a mouthful,"To be quite honest I found this book a bore and a waste of time. The information and factors covered can be found in any reference book, and the way the subject was approached was both unoriginal and showed a lack of imagination. Im dissapointed with Mr Benson, has earlier work was very good and showed much content, but looking back, doesnt all Mr Benson's books read the same?"
2,Not as good as the original blades,"My original trimmer blades started to get a bit dull after 2 years of fairly heavy use, so I figured I'd order a replacement set and my trimmer would be as ""good as new"" again in no time at all. Well, that didn't happen, unfortunately. The new blades do not appear to be of the same quality as the original. They feel lighter, and certainly not as sharp. I've only had them for 2 months and they are almost as dull as the 2-year old blades they are replacing. I am going to order a whole new trimmer now - in the long-run, it's actually a better deal."
2,Not what I hoped,"The unit is light, and easy to use. It works okay on burning bushes, but not grass. It gets hot after only a few mintes of use, and the battery only lasts for about 15 minutes. I think that this unit is also made in a 6 volt, and I sure wish I had purchased that instead."
2,The Replacement Blade is OK - The trimmer is NOT,"I purchased the replacement blades together with the trimmer thinking that the trimmer will last at least two blades (original and replacement). I was wrong, the trimmer did not last one summer. I also purchsed the extention handle with wheels hoping that it would allow me not to have to bend down. When the trimmer was in the handle, it had no power at all, the voltage drop in the handle was so big that the trimmer hardly operated. I rewired the handle with heavier wire but it did not help much. Without the extension handle the trimmer worked for approximately 20 minutes, then needed to be recharged. The charger was not equipped with any indicating lights, no light to indicate charging or power; really a bad design.I do not recommend this product."
4,Good grass cutter,I like this these replacement cutters because they are metal and not plastic....They last a long time and were a great price.
1,Don't know,Can't say one way or another cause I haven't had to replace the blades that came with the unit.Footnote: had to throw away blades cause the unit they go to sucked so bad I threw it away so then had no use or blades.
4,Ken Ishii - Stretch,"Thick techno from one of the Japanese masters at the height of his skills. _Stretch_ compiles two sets of remixes from Ken Ishii. Ian Pooley gives a club-ready swing to ""Stretch,"" while Shogun offers up some atmospheric drum 'n' bass, with Frank De Wulf going straight for hard (and ridiculously catchy) breaks. Ishii's own mix adds twisting layers and a funk bass beneath a rocking beat. For ""Extra,"" Dave Angel works his considerable tech-house magic, and Luke Slater goes slightly more abstract with his tones. Wagon Christ, oddly enough, hands in a mix that doesn't have much bite until halfway through, when he breaks out the electro funk machine and sets it to weird. Fun, nonetheless."
3,another perspective,"Well, i am a fan of bdsm literature but i am not that crazy about this novel... The first chapter is real hot, but it is pretty much down hill from there... Let alone that it seems a little unrealistic... There are some more hot scenes through the book but it just did not blow me away..."
2,Mediocre at Best,"This book started out OK I guess, nothing really to steamy but a small build up it does give. Unfortunatly it then just leaves you feeling bored and unfulfilled.....maybe this was the Authors intention....to leave you with the same feeling her Submissive Lawyer was always left with......waiting and wanting more but instead to just be left there in that state of wanting. This book left me cold and unfilled.....I went and found my Sleeping Beauty Trilogy set and will read those again.So far the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy is one on my favorites for BDSM erotica stories if you're looking for some real one handed reading read them all."
1,Not impressed.,"This book started out steamy, but did not deliver for the rest of the book. This book was unrealistic. The main character is a respected lawyer in Paris, but when this man beats and sodomizes this woman and refuses to have sex with her, she still comes back for more abuse because she claims, ""I belong to him."" How could a sub belong to a dom who does not claim his prize. All he did the entire book was sodomize and beat her. There was no climax or resolution to the book. The main character just allowed herself to be used, abused, and defeated. Their relationship was more like the doormat housewife who is abused by her husband but won't leave him because ""she loves him"" than a bdsm novel. I would not recommend this to anyone, there is better erotic fiction out there."
1,"DON""T DO IT!!!!","I should have read the warning : ""this is the authors first book."" It was SOOOO bad... IT was written poorly... the plot was very unexplained, and the author kept repeating the same thing over... and over...Don't waste your time reading this book."
4,I'll say it's just fine,"First off, read the title of the book. What does it say? Is the title ""A Bloated, Arrogant Analysis of the Movie Blade Runner""? Is it ""A Useless Critical Analysis of the Merits of the Movie Blade Runner""? No, it's ""The Making of Blade Runner"" and if you want to know about the making of this movie then you'll love this book. It isn't written by William Shakespeare. If you want that then go buy MacBeth. If you want some insights into the rewards and heartaches of making a sci-fi movie then this is a good book for it. And by the way, those who say that Blade Runner wasn't a good movie simply haven't watched it enough."
4,A must-read for the serious Blade Runner fan!,"I found this book to be an enlightenning first-hand account of the making of Blade runner, the movie. Taking you from itsbeginnings as a source novel up through its adaptation into a script and finally its transfer onto the big screen. This is not only the tale ofBlade Runner's making but the tale of any movie's production."
4,"A ""couldn't-put-it-down"" book!",I loved it! So interseting. i loved how all the clues fit in the end.Very creative. I hope there is a sequel. The only reason i gave it a 4 star not a 5 star--it was too short! I could read something like this all the time.
1,Dog Safety Vest,"The first vest I ordered from this vender, using the measurement instructions on the vender's site, was wayyyy too large, so had to return, paying postage a 2nd time and then a 3rd to reorder next size down. It was still too large and I have had to alter it myself. The vest is poorly designed and the materials are of a substandard quality. I do not recommend this vest. The sad truth is that there are no other lightweight, unlined safety vests that I could find on the market. Ruff Wear used to make one and they were excellent, but no longer."
1,Domingo is no Quixote,"Geez, what a waste of money. I thought this CD would have been terrific, but I have it in my pile of CDs to get around to take to the secondhand shop. Give me Richard Kiley any day over this terrible rendition of a great musical."
5,Prokofiev / Rachmaninov: Sonatas for Cello and Piano,Prokofiev / Rachmaninov: Sonatas for Cello and Piano is a 1990 Sony Music Entertainment recording starring cellist Yo Yo Ma and pianist Emanuel Ax. Detlef Gojowy has written the music notes. A very charming performance. Yo Yo Ma is truly brilliant. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
2,Disappointing performance of a first-rate work,"Rachmaninoff wrote this sonata (opus 19) and the Second Concerto (opus 18) at about the same time, and they are indeed quite similar, overflowing with haunting melodies, lush harmony, and dramatic climaxes. The difficult piano part is featured as much as the cello.Ax and Ma give a perfunctory and superficial performance, as if they're sight reading or have just learned the work for the recording session. They ignore climaxes and give little shape to the beautiful themes. There's much more to this music than Ax and Ma manage to capture."
3,Bookshelf-mania!,"Went together pretty well. Decently built for a put-together ship item made of particle board. Would've gotten a 4/5 if one of the shelves wasn't missing part of the veneer, it wasn't a shipping issue, it wasn't put on at the factory. Arrived quick!"
3,christmas gift for Dad,Dad saw this and wanted for christmas. With heavy snow in northeast we haven't had a chance to test yet.
5,Chain for Alligator,What can be said about a replacement part? It was just what I wanted and fits my saw perfectly. It is strong and works as required. It arrived as promised and in excellent condition. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Cheap onough not to try and resharpen your old chain,"I bought a chain saw sharpening tool , but it is such a pain to set up and tedious to file each of the teeth individually, that a new chain just makes sense. Also, have a spare and when you are killing time , resharpen the other one."
5,awesome product,Chain saws were the only option until the alligator.once you use one of these you will be amazed.
5,Great Little Invention,The Alligator Lopper is a great little invention for cutting up those sticks that fall out of your trees after a wind storm that are too big to break up but too small for a regular power saw. My husband was delighted when he received it as a gift since he has a big pile of limbs in the back yard to cut up.
4,Sourcing,"We have an 18"" (carbide chain) and a 24"" Bar (skip tooth) Stihl chain saw, which are both highly rated. However, I bought a cordless alligator lopper for my wife's usage and the 'small stuff.' It works well within its parameters--so well, I bought another. It's nice to see chips fly, rather than sawdust. There are many nice little things about the Alligator Lopper--but next to impossible to find someone who sells the saw chains. Sourcing through Amazon was easy--with a great price and very acceptable delivery time (a little planning ahead never hurts). I rarely give 5 stars; 5 stars would have meant that a hand came out of my computer screen and handed me the saw chain as I was ordering online!"
3,Replacement Chains are Expen$ive & Hard to Locate,"I have had to replace my chain once so far and found it impossible to find them locally. Some online prices and availability are OK but the shipping really dings you. I found one online hardware site that had reasonable shipping plus a decent discount so I bought two replacements there. My original chain's life was shortened somewhat by letting someone else borrow the Alligator (they got some dirt in the chain by cutting too close to the ground) as well as my cutting of some trees that were in excess of 6"" in diameter. I have no real complaints about the quality just the price and availability. I still think the Alligator is a fantastic tool."
3,False Advertising,"Overall a pretty good read but I was surprised to find many prominent Richmond inhabitants and residents and other Virginians virtually passed over while many lesser lights, nationally (and, I feel quite sure, locally) speaking, received extensive treatment. While I appreciate the author filling what is surely a void in Virginia historical reportage, in the interest of truth in advertising I would have preferred Ms. McGraw and her publisher call the book, ""At the Falls: Richmond, Virginia and Its Minority and Female People."""
1,Let's Excercise by Being Incredibly Annoying!,"After reading three reviews, I decided to try Denise Austin's tape. I was frustrated by her over-rated enthusiasm, and the quality of the cheesy eighties background and attitude. Let's jump into the millenium by getting rid of this video! I am in fairly good shape, and I work out about an hour a day. However, with this tape I did not feel any sort of a difference in my body. And on top of that, my back aches beyond belief after doing the workout. Save yourself the money, and go jogging instead."
5,Perfect book,This order was just as advertised. I since ordered four more copies with the same perfect results. I would order again
3,what no kokane singing this time,this isn't a bad tune seems like everybody has to get pharrel to cash in now I like the song he could have did this with kokane though.
4,1/2 size less than market,"Mezlan Men's Lee Slip-onIt is one excelent pair of shoes unfortunaly the Size chart is not accurate, the real size is Half size less than market. It is bad specially to foreing costumers"
5,Discover the Power Within You : A Guide to the Unexplored Depths Within,Awesome transaction. Thanks.
2,OOps !.. too much religious stuff here,"I guess this is not a book for a person who is not a religious !.This book talks about bible every second line and at one point of time, you just want to keep it on shelf..In my opinion , Book title is little misleading as this is a average book with too much religious stuff...Just avoid it.. there are better books out there."
5,WOW... a Life Changing Book,"I have been meaning to write a review of this book since the first day I received it, but today, after picking it up, and rereading it for like the 6 th time, I finally decided to, because its such an important book, in helping us understand how to deal with life. Whether your problems concern relationships, money, or whatever this book can help you . It centers on Jesus' teachings, and reveals truths to you that can help you rise above any situation if applied. I also have two of his other books, and plan to get the ones I don't have soon. I highly recommend this book."
3,"This item is cute, but not what I thought.",I bought the cat photo album for my daughter and a friend's daughter. I thought it would be something they could look at by themselves. I fear that both girls are too young for this album. I think the pages will not hold up for younger children. I will save the albums for when they get older.
4,Times Atlas 10th,"the tenth edition is not quite the same as the magnificent eighth edition, but the times atlas is still the best one volume world atlas i have ever seen. the eighth edition had more beautiful city maps and an excellent laminated place holder/map key. maybe in the eleventh edition these things will be brought back."
4,"Heavy, Expensive and with lots of small print . . .","You will need a magnifying glass for the very small print. I nearly strained my back lifting the book after it was delivered. But, the world is a heavy thing. I like the book because I can look up back-water places in every puny little country in every nook and cranny on this old Earth of ours. It is also a good prop-up under my old feather pillow, as I need something large and firm. Plus, it's kind of nice to know the world in right underneath my pillow. I sometimes dream of far away places that I visited as a boy. My father was a traveler who inherited a great deal of money and little common sense. He lugged us three kids around while my mother complained about food, coarse bed linens and bugs."
2,The formation of Arabian Gulf?,"National Geographic Atlas has always been a great informational source. However, I was quite shocked by what I saw in the last edition (the 8th). I am sure most of those who have bought this Atlas or had a chance to look at it by now, have noticed the formation of a new gulf that never existed before, Arabian Gulf! It's sad how money can replace names even in the map (Arabian Gulf instead of Persian Gulf!) What National Geographic hasn't noticed yet is how its credibility has dropped among the intellectual crowd and many others are enraged by this act. I never thought history can be distorted, but with what I saw from National Geographic, which has lost it's credibility among those that understand the impact of this change, I am not so sure any more. It's unfortunate and humiliating what money can do!"
5,Yeah. Baby it's finally here.,"NFL Street 2 packs alot more stuff than its original. One of the best open field feature is the the Wall-Juk'in. Run near a wall. Pull and Hold Lefft and Hold B fly through air doging all who opose you. There are some new Street Events too. Like Crush the Carrier, or called Throw em' up Bust em' up. It even packs Xibit as well. There are many teams you have to unlock. There are Team Xibit and Reebok and many more. Last before I spoil any more you can collect Posters that you see (Those Paintings). Online Play too."" I'm not the one that's so very far away, I feel the snake bite enter my vain"" my favorite line on one of the songs."
2,dont like it,I DONT LIKE THIS GAIM.IT IS NUT VARY REEALISTIK. iT IS NUT VARY FUN ETHER. I DONT THINCK PEEPEL SHUD GET THIS GAIM.
5,NFL Street 2 is not just for the street anymore,When you pick this game up in a store or look at it on the internet you have a good chance at falling in love with it. The rap in the game helps make it feel more like an urban style game. I think it is cool how Xzhibit is in the game. Also there are a ton of unlockabales in this game. One unlockable is team Xzhibit and the NFL Legends. You can also play as the NFC and AFC division allstars in this. It is great if you ask me. If you pick up one game this month pick up NFL Street 2.
3,To much expectations,"You guys I'm not saying this game is horible but I bought it the day it came out. The problem was I expecteid to see these steriod buff Ray Lewis football players breaking tackles all day long. Instead you get these smaller (Thank God) football players that play more realistic. This was a very positive and very frustating at the same time.Now this is were all the extras come in handy. All the etras are really fun and addictive but you must hove friends to realy enjoy the mini games. So basiclly you hawve Nfl Street with mini games, a couple of story modes (sort of), an incredable customization system, Xzibt, and new wall moves and you have NFL Street 2.So this game is pretty sweet with lots of replay value. But I feel EA games is getting sloppy and is doing exactly what Lucisarts did with Star Wars. Over all 4.5 out of 5.0"
3,NFL STREET 2,I THOUGHT NFL STREET 1 HAS BETTER GRAPHICS. IT SEEMED LIKED THEY CRAMMED TOO MUCH ART INTO THE GAME. I HAVE A 60INCH TV AND KIND OF GOTTA STRAIN MY EYES TO NOTICE THE EXTRA DETAIL.
5,Better than Dell,"My Dell computer died so I ordered another one ($1,200) from Dell but delivery was in several weeks and I realized I could not be without a computer that long so I went shopping for something cheap that would carry me over and I ended up with a SR1720NX. After using both I now find I much prefer the Presario. I have not used the double side DVD record feature yet but it is nice to have and the LightScribe feature is fabulous. I am so satisfied with the Presario that Dell has seen the last of my money. I am hard of hearing and the Dell is just not loud enough but the Presario knocks my head off with its volume. It is also a good bit smaller than my Dell which is nice. The only thing bad about the Presario is that it did not come with enough memory but I have ordered more. I even like the keyboard better on the Presario; it has a lot more features and seems more rugged. Next time I need a new computer it will be Compaq/HP"
1,Alex toy fun but only if it works.,"The toy was fun for two days. My 2 year old son loved it. But it broke in two days, with no harsh play. It merely sat in the tub and was used as it is intended. The sprayer stopped spraying. Without the spray, it just became an especially annoying musical toy."
3,Nice scent,"Found these to burn faster than regular incense but has great scent. However, it doesn't last long tho.but somewhat soothing."
4,lovely scent,"I forgot to review this product but better late than never.I am very happy with the incense sticks - the odor is wonderful and they burn fairly clean.I bought a box and so I expect they will last a long time. I do not burn every day but at least a few times per week. All in all, nice product."
4,PRETTY GOOD STUFF,"I really like the smell of lavender....these sticks have a pretty good aroma....nor the best that I have purchased, but pretty darned good..."
4,Nice smell.,"Good product though I prefer frankincense/myrrh; serves the purpose of making a cozy, clean and calm environment. A good partner for studying and reading."
2,Odd assortment,"While reading this book, I continually had to check the cover to verify it had been Marion Zimmer Bradley who produced this twaddle. The authors she uses are continually getting younger and the quality is dropping."
3,a good read,"This book by Bemrose is about a family. The family has their share of problems. From an idealistic father to other problems it is a very interesting and good story. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
3,A Competent Novel,"I enjoyed reading this novel. I like books set in my home province, with real characters and real situations. If you like fiction, you should like this book."
3,Its okay,I was taking it to help with low thyroid but I havent seen any improvement after 3 weeks. Others I know take it and do see improvement.
3,Inconclusive results,"I purchased this product for a family member as a supplement to help with a thyroid issue. This product caused the individual to devlop a rash on her hand. The individual took the product again a week later, and developed another rash. Perhaps the individual just had a bad reaction to Kelp in general, or perhaps not. The individual discontinued use."
5,An Incredible Album! THE Benchmark,Oh! These recordings are so... sublime. His touch and timing are absolutely masterful. It soars. This is the best recording of #21 I have ever hear. Just listen to it!Highest recommendation.
5,music to melt you! Beautiful!,"I have had this book and CD for over 2 years now and it is my favorite.IT is absolutely beautiful. The music is touching to the heart and soul. THe music has such feeling. It is so easy to play on the flute.I am impressed that music written so simple can sound so pretty. The Cd plays all 44 songs on flute and guitar in harmony.The CD is beautiful just on it's own. I listen to it almost every day. This is the best music book i have ever seen. My music teacher was impressed by the music in the book also and will be ordering one for herself. The music would be great to be played at weddings or special engagements.I think jessica and alex did a wonderful job ! This book deserves more than 5 stars.I also want to say some of the music is hundreds of years old, and the feeling i get when i play it takes me away to another century along time ago. It is very romantic!Very easy to play,very simple music theory."
1,Mexico vs USA,Solenoid didn't fit my valve. The original solenoid was made in the USA and the replacement was made in Mexico.
1,do you like water?,"i am a fan of the tassimo machine, and many of the t-discs. however the signature blend should be retitled the signature bland. perhaps i just look a fuller bodied coffee particularly in the morning, but this one was exceptionally disappointing to me... take note of the different roast levels posted on tassimos website before buying discs that cost about $.50-$.75 per cup..."
4,Fender Flares,Excellant. Met all my expactations. Quality and at an affordable price. Easy to paint to your preferance. I would reccomend this item to all. Darn it. ..... This is for a full size truck. I have a downsized SUV. Me bad.
5,Much more than a book on surveying,"One of the most enjoyable books I have read in my life time. I have a back ground in surveying but it spanned much more than this. It has concisely encapsulated the roots of the American psyche."""
5,The Importance of Land Ownership,"Andro Linklater describes the importance of private property (land ownership) to the formation of a dynamic economy and a democratic government.The most urgent challenge facing the newly-independent United States in 1784 was how to pay for the war that won the country its independence; the debt of the new republic was enormous. The country's greatest asset was the land west of the Ohio River, but in order to sell this huge territory, the land had to be surveyed; measured and mapped. And, before that could be done, a uniform set of weights and measures had to be chosen for the new republic out of a morass of some 100,000 different units that were in use in daily life. This is the story of surveying and measuring and mapping and real estate.George Washington began as a surveyor.I read the pre-publication galley edition. I love this book and I understand the final hardcover edition has maps.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com."
3,Hard Read in Places But Interesting Topic,"It is facsinating, especially in this time of overdevelopment in our country to get such a book. A chapter at the end about surveying, our large Great Plains farms and overdevelopment and surveying would have been interesting. Some chapters were very readable. Others, I found hard going."
3,The author should stick to 'American' business etiqutte.,"This is an easy to read booklet; I read it while waiting at the airport in Madrid to catch my flight back to the USA.Ann Marie Sabath, like many of us Americans, knows what is right and wrong in our country 'etiquettely speaking;' however, she is presumptuous when she gives 'international' business etiquette advice.I agree with the reviewer, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, who says that Ms. Sabath is giving etiquette advice about the Chinese without the proper knowledge of the culture. For a person to really know the etiquette of a country, he should have been born in that country and/or have lived in it for a number of years.Being born in a country AND living in it, however, is the best way to know 'the customs and etiquette' of a particular country. Ms. Sabath should stick with 'American' business etiquette."
4,"Fast-paced, exciting and realistic","A fast-paced, exciting and realistic look at a cop's view of the world. The main story revolves around the actions of and search for a demented killer, responsible for some grisly murders. But some of the best parts of the book explore the characters of two very different cops, one a middle-aged veteran who's seen it all, the other a female, Vietnamese-American rookie, dealing with prejudice from her fellow cops and opposition from her family over her chosen career. Unwilling partners, they respond to situations ranging from bizarre to comical to deadly. One criticism I would have is that sometimes the reader can becomes lost in the details, jargon, and large number of minor characters, also, some of the violence is very graphic. It is a raw perspective on a cop's world, with gore and humor closely intertwined."
1,Brutal,The title is somewhat right on this book. Instead of brutal Mercies it should be brutal reading. I tried to read this garbage but I couldn't get through the book. I am sorry I ever purchased this so called novel.
1,don't wast your money,Bought this over priced book because I know the author - could not finish this trash
4,What a BARGIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First off I was at my local book store and was looking for a Zombie book to read and ran across this book. The cover had caught my eye and it sounded good, so I bought it for $1.50, and it looked NEW!!! What a deal!!! This is a EXPENSIVE book! So I began to read it and thought the begining was a little hard to follow, but the book started to flow. It starts because a land developer in N.Y.C. wants to built the ""Highest"" highrise building ever and while digging the footings (basement) of the building they find a 1000 year old ship buried(The ship is huge) and when they cut a hole into it all HELL brakes lose!!! After they open the ship up the book really takes off and is very good! I think if you like the zombie, monster horror you`ll like this book. If you can find it ""BUY IT""!!!!"
4,Zombies from a Pre-Roman Ship Stalk New York City,"An ancient ship has been found beneath where a highrise will go up in New York City, a pre-Roman Etruscan ship. What brought a ship so far from the Mediterranean just to bury the vessel here? Archaeologist and one-time cop Abraham Stroud is called in to investigate upon his return from Egypt and finds that the ship contains something which is turning people into living zombies.Stroud is a character created by Caine who in previous books confronted vampires and Midwestern werewolves. Now he turns to zombies, but to the author's credit, not the usual Voodoo variety.The story is fast-paced and builds to a satisfying ending. Zombies are not among my favorite supernatural creatures. The actual concept was explained by a psychologst in The Serpent and the Rainbow, wheree he discovered it's all built on a combination of drugs and manipulation of Voodoo beliefs by witch doctors, but I give credit to Caine for taking a different approach and a readable story."
4,Funky & Majestic,"You'll see Trilok Gurtu and Wally Badarou named on about half the CDs of the past couple of years that involve Indian or African musicians playing East-West crossover. I've avoided them all, until now. But this really works: thanks to an excellent set of vocalist guest stars, and some very classy percussion work. It's really nothing like I expected. The songs are a subtle mixture of Indian or African influences, or clearly from one camp or the other. And you'll never get the chant from 'Maya' out of your head. The production is absolutely crystal clear, something one tends to find in percussionists' recordings, since they're so used to being buried in the mix..."
2,Surprisingly Dull,"Gurtu is a great session and guest percussionist, but Beat of Love is a surprisingly bland salad of ""world beat"" clichés and pop synthesized keyboard filler. Like a lot of this kind of artificially thrown together, attempted melding of genres, it doesn't hold up after a couple of playings."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"The two part booklets on World History are just not on a par with the original ""Anchor Atlas of World History I & II"". The Penguin Atlas's lack any sort of detail whatsoever with their choice of equally dull 3 color maps, gas station road maps are more exciting.Every map in both volumes displays the same dull color choice of pale blue to represent oceans, white for the continents, and black dots & printing to show cities & regions.The Penguin Atlas series is about as exciting as a runny nose."
5,Pulp.,"I just started getting into Pulp and really don't know much about their music catalogue but this was the first album I bought by the band. This version has two discs, the first is the original album and the second is a mix of live, rare covers and b-sides. I really only wanted the album but decided to go with the deluxe edition and I'm really glad I did. There is an awesome version of Disco 2000 with Nick Cave, which sold me on the entire purchase. It's a great album and I would recommend it to anyone!"
3,OK,"This album is not what I expected it to be. It's a bit overproduced and monotonous, but it does make its point. Not a record you could expect from an American band."
3,A Solid Effort!,"At its best, Empowering Employees by Kenneth L. Murrell and Mimi Meredith illustrates the vogue concept of worker empowerment as it relates to real-life business, devoid of the touchy-feely clichés such nomenclature may evoke. The book cannot completely avoid a collapse into idealism and jargon however, and long sections of several chapters amount to cheery descriptions of the motivated and satisfied employees that empowerment will breed. These breezy passages fortunately are grounded by examples of companies like Toyota and AT&T that have embraced empowerment - or portions of it - to great success. So if employee-burnout is an issue in your office, or if you are looking for an easy-to-digest explanation of one of today's most popular management trends, we [...] recommend this book to you."
5,Whilrling Dervishes in Turkey,This book presents the ceremony of the Whirling Dervishes in pictures and in words. Beautiful pictures and interesting text.
2,Didn't help,I have a malipoo and he wanted no part of these. I tried everything to get him to go on the pads but they just didn't work for us.
1,very displeased,"I don't know what kind of plastic is used for the backing on these pads but it is porous which defeats the purpose entirely. I will not buy them again, which is too bad as previously I had been very satisfied with other products from this company.Simple Solution 11035 Stay At Home Floor Protection Pads (50 pack)"
4,"The product works, but there is a better altternative...","Check out Simple Solutions, Natural Bio-degradable Pet Training Pads 46 Count. You pay alittle more but they are MUCH better for the environment and they work great!!! Remember, DO NOT dispose of animal waste into compost/recycle containers."
3,Great Pad but Wrong Size Listed,"Listing and picture show 23 inches by 24 inches, but received package shows 22 1/2 by 22 1/2 inches and they are actually the smaller size.Great pads, but they are not big enough for my holders."
5,Bold Brother Label Tape,"Brother laminated 3/4-inch black on yellow label tape is great for home or office. Works with nearly all Brother labelers that take TZ tape. Yellow and black stands out, so it is easy to find items labeled with this tape."
4,"Excellent Translation, but notes needed.","This is an excellent translated version of the Quran. In my studies with some of the Islamic faith, this translation aided in understanding their beliefs. The thing that seems to be lacking in my opinion, is notes. I would have enjoyed having notes, and so would my Islamic friends, since that would have saved them from atleast some of my questions. Overall, a good version, which has aided me in understanding others and their views."
3,Not too accurate it seems,"This is a nicely presented edition, and is more readbale than some.I don't know Arabic but this translation differes in a number of spots from all others and from analyses I ahve read of poassages, in an innacruate way. In particular it waters down some of the harsh bits. One surah that admonishes believers to beat women for instance is translated very differently here! There are many such divergences! This is a consistent pattern, and I finally baought another trans because I lost faith in the accuracy of this one."
1,Better in the Picture,I didn't like the color (too bright) or the fit (like a sack) of this item. I definitely would not buy it again.
5,Claudio gets back and strikes again!!!,Io Sono qui was the perfect title for Baglioni's comeback after 6 years of absence from a studio performance.The songs contain a style more mature and very distant from Baglioni's songs of the seventies.Anyway it's still close to the experiences of all Baglioni's fans that followed him through all these years since Questo piccolo grande amore. I suggest to buy this masterpiece as soon as you can. Elena De Romanis
2,Not much to say about this one.,"Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Drafts 1-38: Toll (Wesleyan, 2001)I've (ironically) put down a number of drafts of this review, and haven't come up with anything remotely satisfying. There's really not much I have to say about the book; it's overlong (though from what I have been able to gather it's only the first two sections of a larger, as yet unfinished, work), close to unintelligible in places, full of parallel text branching off the main piece with no stage direction as to how a reader is supposed to read said parallel text, and drops out of what poetic mode it has in places and becomes didactic (""Deixis"" is the most blatant example of this). All of this leads to a simple ""didn't like it much."" Nothing else to be said, I guess. **"
2,The worst solo spice effort.,"Mel,s Hot should be called luke warm its pathetic. Her voice can get a little annoying. Mel has to be the worst singer in the group. Some critics bashed Geri Halliwell's singing ability but at least she,s pulling out number 1 hits. And after listening to Geri,s new single ride it I must say her singing lessons paid off, she sounds better than ever. But back to this album the songs are effortless and it makes Victoria,s debut look like gold. It seems to me that she,s giving up on her solo career.We can only hope."
3,Never excellent...,"Well this cd is good in many ways, but none of the songs reach that excellence you feel is burning just out of reach. A good listen tho, makes me want to stand up and dance (and sometimes jerk off..) anyways its never very excellent which means your better off without it."
2,She's Not Scary Spice Anymore,"A more appropriate title for Melanie B's solo album would be ""Lukewarm."" It's got a few good songs, but for the most part, the disk is taken up with put-me-to-sleep ballads, and bluntly sexual R&B songs. This may be a nice debut album for someone who enjoys Missy Elliott, but for us pop fans, it's a total let-down. Instead of this, try Victoria Beckham's solo album, Free Me by Emma Bunton, or one of the three Geri Halliwell CDs."
4,Way Better Then Credited,"Although I wasn't a big fan of the Spice Girls, I liked the single Holla so I decided to give there solo projects a listen. This by far to me was the best of them, although there are spots on the album that are too pop for me, there are tracks that really show case this rather limited singer in a new light. On the track Pack Your S***, she hits notes you wouldn't think she could hit, nowhere near a Whitney Houston, or a Monica, but impressive for her range. The track Step Inside is a sexier, more raspy side to her voice, while Hotter, ABC 123, and I Want You Back, showcase the Melanie B. that we've all known from the Spice Girls. The other stand out track is Tell Me, the rest where boring, bad, forgettable, or too pop to me."
4,......Surprising A Pretty Good Solo Effort,"I was expecting the cheesy British ""Pop"" music on this CD.....but wow, it was pretty darn good. The production team includes Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson), Missy Elliott (Monica, Aaliyah, Beyonce) and Rodney Jerkins (Toni Braxton, Brandy, Destiny's Child).The best track is the first one...""Feels So Good"". If you like Missy or Janet, you might wanna check it out..."
5,Slow to start but keep reading,I read the Bangkok series first and thought I had given a 4 star review earlier. That was when I was at about page 80. This book is slower to start than his later Bangkok books. But it's definitely worth reading on. We have plot twists and the usual interesting characters. I definitely recommend it.
5,The Peaks of Hong Kong,"Many years ago, I read Clavell's Noble House and didn't think anyone could ever capture the fascinating city of HK as well as he did. Until now. I just picked up Burdett's The Last Six Million Seconds and I was wrong. Just as Burdett does with Bangkok, he makes me feel like I'm living in HK before its turn-over to the PRC. The nuances of the government, society, triads, crim, food, and the sultry heat of this place all come out in the author's excellent writing and descriptions. Thoroughly enjoyable.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
2,Product description is not accurate,"Since the product description included 3 different products, I was not sure which I was ordering (so I probably should not have ordered from this provider, but there you go --hind sight.) The product seems like a reasonable quality, but was only 2 -4 foot, not the size I wanted. :("
4,Machine washable dry clean only,"This is a very nice set. It seems well made. It's comfortable and looks good.However, while the product description says it's machine washable, tags attached to items say ""dry clean only."" I never dry clean anything. I bought this specifically because the description said it's washable, having thrown its dry clean only predecessor bedspread into the trash after the dog threw up on it.Maybe it is washable. I don't really know. But it is very nice and I mention this cleaning issue in case the dry clean only instructions really are important, something I will undoubtedly find out."
3,"Clear, organized, concise","This book is littered with typos :( That aside, there are not enough books out there on childbirth and pregnancy acupuncture. This one is Big and beautful, easy to read and full of useful information. Zita West's experience and success is inspiring."
5,conditioner,This is a product line our family has used for years and is very difficult to find/purchase in the Northwest region of the US. I was especially happy to find it available on Amazon.
2,Made my hair like straw,"This product I gave a couple of weeks worth of tries, but as much as I wanted to like it, the end result was dry, straw-like hair and a drain-full of hair that fell out as I was washing it!"
2,This one didn't do it for me.,I got through about 75% of this book and lost interest. I have read many books related to this subject and did not find this one very helpful.
1,Terrible,"I couldn't make it past 10 pages of the book. Its not interesting, not educational, not deep, not fun...id say its almost painful to read.I recommend getting w.hewitts book instead."
1,Great story. Poor quality book.,"It is sooooooo difficult to find bilingual titles of any quality. Korean titles are even more rare. Lucky me, then when I discover the wonderful story of ""Guess How Much I Love You"" in Korean. Without question, this is one of the best kids' stories around and the fact that is in both English and Korean is a boon for me and my Korean-American daughter, Song.However, the quality of this republished book is absolutely POOR. I ordered this book from Culture for Kids and within two weeks the binding came unglued and the pages continue to fall out. I only read the book once and put it back on the shelf. I now tell my daughter that the book is only for look, not touch because I am afraid the book will continue to disintegrate. Naturally, she is very upset.BUYER BEWARE: this book may be of insufficient quality to withstand a second reading."
3,Coming up short?,"As an Asian male, I enjoyed the Japanese story, but the book comes up short (no pun intended) in view of the long legacy of the Asian cuckold which is otherwise ignored.That is a well known theme that today is being further eroticized by the extent of Asian females and their interracial (mainly White) lovers, not only with the acquiesence but often encouragement of the cuckold husband...who comes to enjoy his predicament.In fact, it is the cuckold male's humilition which provides the extra ""kick"" his wife and her lover(s) enjoy. A perfect triad of primal pleasure..."
3,good cuckold story,"<html>I thought this book was well written had alot of cool stories about<a href=""http://www.cuckold-authority.thumblogger.com"">cuckold</a></html>"
4,Interesting Book That Will Make You Think,"What can I say? It was fascinating. Some of Charles Swindoll's chapters are about men we have always known like Abraham, but Mr. Swindoll gives it a different outlook on a lesser known story. However, most of the chapters are about people that in Charles Swindoll's own words, are ""nobodies"" and making them into stories we can live by. I really feel like I learned a lot and even better thought about what he was teaching in each chapter. I would highly recommend this book or any in the Great Lives series for anyone looking to study further."
5,Road Biking Virginia,My biking group and I are continuously looking for new ideas to expand our routes and learn about the Virginia back roads.This book gives you all you could possibly want. I love the detailed descriptions of the terrain and conditions of each proposed ride; but also the inclusion of attractions and local events to add to the pleasure of planning the trip.This book is already getting dog-eared with rides I am staking out for me and my friends.
2,Disappointed,"The book needs serious updating as many of the restaurants and small groceries described have closed. A friend and I had been looking forward to eating at Wachapreague's Island House Restaurant only to find it had not only closed but was for sale. Luckily for us, we encountered fishermen who'd just hauled a boat. No, there was no place to buy food in town, they explained. But one fisherman, having found packages of Oreo cookies on board gave us more than enough to to tide us over. And Wachapreague was far from the only time we found ""favorite restaurants"" had closed. Many of the routes are great - but it's important to take food with you."
5,Great music from a great band,"One of the greatest song combinations ever put on record, Dreamer Deceiver and Deceiver are not only musically phenomenal, but also show the unbelievable talent of the greatest male vocalist of any genre, Rob Halford. And then to end it all with Island of Domination, WOW!!!, what an album. I would include this album and Priest's Stained Class near the top in a best of heavy metal albums list. An absolute must have."
5,"At their prime, probably the tightest music of the genre","I can't blieve I am to be the first to review this music. No one does it better than the Priest when dual lead guiters are led into musical battle by the piercing vocals of Rob Halford. Simply put, this album was the benchmark of what heavy metal music was all about. The seering riffs and constant changes keep the listener riveted to the speakers. Very theatric and moving. If you like it hard, you'll love this one."
5,Priest's Best...Metal at its best,"Judas Priest is one of those rare Heavy Metal bands that seem to never put out a bad album (well...Turbo)Stained Class, British Steel, Screaming for Vengenace...but in my mind Sad Wings of Destiny is easily thier best effort. It's classic metal and classical metal at that: Roaring, crushing guitar riffs alongside reflective piano solos and gentle ballads. The album starts with one of Priest's best works, ""Victim of Changes"", and the quality of the album just doesn't let up after that. ""The Ripper"",""Dream Deciever"",""Tyrant""....to finish it all off with the bruising ""Island of Domination""...incredible. Halford's voice is at it's best here, with complete range from a pleasant tenor to glass-shattering wails. From what he shows here, he's the best male vocalist I've heard, heavy metal or otherwise. If you're into 90s crap metal, stay away. If you're a fan of great, classic 70's metal, you simply can't miss with this one. Amazon, get on the ball and get it in stock!!"
5,Absolutely the BEST Rob Halford tracks.......!,"Once upon a time there was a Judas Priest that didn not wear leather, but wore satin bell bottoms and wrote late 70's art rock...This album is a Judas Priest you have never heard before. Its ARTSY, orchestrated, utilizing piano and vintage guitar techtures. BEST OF ALL IS ROB HALFORD'S TRACKS. AS A ROCK VOCALIST MYSELF, I WILL SAY THAT IF YOU LIKE HALFORD, you will love the smooth , young voice this album captures. Halford is young, fresh, clean, with 4 octaves and MUCH dynamics.....THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP 10 ROCK VOCAL ALBUMS. This is in the league of Tate, LeBrie, Lynn Turner, Dio, Perry, and all the great rock singers.......do it!"
4,Back Yard Storage,"It took only a few days to get my storage chest. Much sooner than expected. Working alone, it was awkward to try to get together but I soon figured it out. It's very good looking & blends in well with our gray house. I put it under the deck so it's sort of out of sight. The price is right; over $50 less than Home Depot. Great buy!!"
3,Adequate storgae,The storage is adequate but kind of clumbsy to open and shut. My husband added something to the lid to make it open in one piece rather than two pieces.
1,Flimsy Construction & Over Priced!,"This item arrived in a box that was nearly shredded in half barely holding together the flimsy contents. Upon assembling it became apparent that the sides of this storage container were warped. It took ten minutes to assemble and you'll need a rubber mallet to bang it together.Had I known how poorly constructed this unit would be I would have gone down to the local hardware store and purchased some plywood, bracing and a few hinges to build a much more durable storage container for half the money.I've noticed others have given this a good rating so perhaps I just received a bad unit. Whatever the case may be I certainly will not be purchasing any more Rubbermaid Deck Containers online."
2,Falls apart if you look at it wrong,"I'm a pretty small woman, and have owned this box for a week. It has fallen apart on me every time I have used it - the top hinges come undone, the side walls bend outwards, and just this morning the back wall came off entirely. It seems to be waterproof and would work for someone who does not actually open it frequently like I do (for example if you're storing a generator in it and only access it a few times a year). But if you're opening and shutting these doors a lot and actually expect this thing to hold together in one piece, you will be very disappointed. I plan on returning mine because the quality of construction is unacceptable."
1,overpriced & smaller than dimensions given,"The dimensions provided are not accurate. This storage shed is smaller than we had anticipated and can't store the portable generator we bought it for. (And, yes, we measured beforehand.) it's also generally pretty flimsy. The lid doesn't close properly, and the walls and lid fit together awkwardly. Definitely not waterproof."
3,Wierd assembly instructions,A nice product but pretty difficult to assemble. The instructions are difficult to understand and the pictures are obscure. The quality of the plastic is good and its got lots of storage.
1,poor,"This product is made from molded plastic, it did not fit together tightly. Water could have come in the side of the doors. It is very light and could be broken into with little effort, even with the lock latch. I sent it back for refund. measurements are outside walls, not inside storage space."
2,"Didn't go together well, smaller than expected",We have the Rubbermaid 32-C feet storage and love it. Somehow this one just isn't the same quality. I'm angry more at myself than Rubbermaid because I am shocked at how much LESS storage there is with 18-feet so BE SURE TO MEASURE BEFORE YOU UNDERBUY. But the reason for our low review is that it didn't go together as well as the larger one and the seams in 2 places are large enough to allow lots of little crawling critters in... and the whole reason we go rubbermaid is to eliminate things like that outdoors with sheds like this!
5,Great storage!,I've had one of these before and knew that when I needed a second one this would be just perfect for storing my pool supplies.
4,Wrong first chorus,"This is a great recording in German. I am enjoying it as I learn this piece for a concert in May. Two problems which are probably my fault. First, the company sent me two emails in German and I pronounce German but do not read it so I just trusted that they thanked me for my order and were sending it to me. Second problem was that the first chorus is not the first one in the Henle score but the alternate one at the end of the score.Bach: St. John Passion"
3,Where's the opening chorus?,"I love Bach's music and his religiously based pieces are definitely some of my favorite. However, the one piece that turned me on to the Johanne's Passion was missing in this rendition. While it is a well-produced production, my whole point of buying it was to hear their version of the Herr, unser, Herr chorus part, which is not included. It's one of those pieces that sticks with you. If you do not care for that piece, by all means buy this product! But at the price I paid for it, I would expect the opening chorus to be included. That is why I give it three stars"
2,titanium knif,Why titanium.its too loght to hamer with. Stainless is fine.Titanium is shear hype to get you to part with your money. Get a stainless blade and leave the extra pound of led at home.
5,Great quality!,"This is a lovely quilt. It's heavy and well built, and prettier than depicted in the photos. It also washed well with no problems. I was very pleased, and so was my daughter when she recieved it for her birthday!"
5,No better book of this sort,A must have for aserious Williams fan. Considerd by most to be the founder of this genre. Exceeded my expectations.Xlnt value.
5,Best collection of Robert Williams,"This book is in my opinion, the best collection of Robert Williams art work. Nuff said!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I got this product today and it is already boxed up to go back to Amazon. It wouldn't get an IP address and after hours of trying and talking to tech support, I gave up. Couple this wither other bad reviews, don't waste your time or money.This product over-promises and just plain doesn't deliver.There might be something better somewhere but this multifunction print server is terrible. Don't say you weren't warned! I ignored the other bad reviews to try it anyway, my mistake!Also as an update, I forgot to add the fact that the Installation CD that came with it was defective. I tried it in multiple drives and it was bad disc."
4,"Does what it says, slow with dell printers",I bought this for two home networks I manage. One had a Dell AIO printer and while the server worked it printed at about 1ppm b&w. The other network had an HP 2410 all-in-one and it worked fine. Setup was easy on Windows XP machines.
1,"Great idea, if it works","Maybe I got a bad unit, but no matter what I did, I couldn't get this thing to get an IP address. I tried four different routers with no luck. Unfortunately there's absolutely no way to communicate with this unless it's on a network, so if it doesn't work right out of the box, you'll never get it to work."
1,IOGEAR USB Print Server,My occupation is a computer technician and I could not get this device to issue an IP address after 3 tech support calls and 2 replacement units.IOGEAR tech support is unhelpful at best and their products seem to be hit or miss.Unless you want a 20 dollar paper weight with a USB and Ethernet port then I would stay far away!
1,"SUX, not a print ""server""...","This is a network usb port, not a print server!!!Only works with one pc at a time, and only if you run their software.TEKNOW"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I was tempted to buy this product as it was reasonably priced and seemed to support what I needed. After I got this product it did not work - the software could not detect the unit on the network. I troubleshooted the problem with IOGEAR technical support and was told that the unit was defective and I should return it. Thinking that this can happen once, I ordered a replacement unit. Guess what? this one did not work as well. The same exact problem - the unit did not get an ip and therefore was not detected. Again customer support and again I was told to return the unit. I am not buying an IOGEAR again."
1,VERY BAD !!!!!,"I Buy this item and i'm nothing happy, in my case the print server don't to take never a ip address. The Technical support did not give to me one concrete answer and I could not make it work."
1,No luck with print server,"I was never able to get this print server to work. There utility software would not find the printserver on my network. I spent time on the phone with IOGEAR tech support. They tried to get it to work with no luck. They said to send it back, which I did. The interface was easy to install and would have been easy to use, but there is no way to get at the printserver setup without the utility and if the utility doesn't find the printserver you cannot do a thing."
5,Great winter boots!,These boots are everything I hoped for! I've worn them in snow when the temperatures were below 10 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time and still had warm feet!
5,Another great boot by Keen,"I bought these boots mostly for snowshoeing this winter. I did wear them on a motorcycle color ride up here in the northwoods when it was in the low 30's one morning. My feet were happy, never cold and comfortable all day long. Walking around they were very comfortable. Now the real test will be when snow comes. I am sure that I will like them for snowshoeing. How can you not, ""There Keen's"" I own 6 or 7 differnt pair of Keen. I really like them all and would continue to buy them. In my opinion, they are the most comfortable, funtional shoes you can buy and they look good too!"
2,Awkward Fit,"Everyone who says buy 1/2 size larger, maybe this is true for them. I wear an 11.5 and tried on a pair of 12's at a local store (unfortunately they didn't have 11.5). The 12s were too big so I ordered the 11.5. Arrived today, build quality seems great! Here's the problem: right shoe fits great, left shoe is too small. It's very tight in the toebox (odd for Keen shoes). Feels as though the patented ""Keen Protect"" rubber toe protector digs into the top of my toes, very uncomfortable. I wear Keen sandals and Keen casual shoes and just love them; these boots, not so much."
4,Depends so much on how one sees from where one is,"I read one of the comments, decided to pass. The other, hesitated. Finally got the book. Aryadeva tersely centers on some points one rejects. It has an effect of not very savoury medecine. Gyel-tsap comments I find clear and funny, and I like his comparisons, often not understood. Geshe Sonam's comments are simple and discreete, and the translator has formal english.So is it Aryadeva's, Gyel-tsap's, Geshe Sonam Rinchen's or the translator's fault? None, I think. This is not about expounding Nagaruja philosophy, nor emphasizing some points as Chandakirti.It is a more like closing arguments, a little wild, nailing it."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","Save your money do not buy this book. The questions in the book do not reflect what is on the test. If you can balance your checkbook, figure the price on a percentage off sale, double, triple or halve a recipe and total your sales with the double coupons you can pass the math section. For the reading read Time, Newsweek. If you can understand the articles and graphs that go with the article you will pass the reading portion.The book does a diservice to people. I can see where a lot of people might just give up and not take the test, especially if they have been out of school for awhile. The math explanations to the questions are horrible even I couldn't understand them and my bachelor degree is in math.Shame on Barron's for not actually working on a book for the CBEST but for taking portions of their other test books and throwing them all together and calling it a CBEST prep book."
5,Worth the Money,"I hate tests. I heard from a lot of people that the CBEST was easy, but I have been out of school for a long time and didn't want to take a chance. This book was easy to follow. Yes, there was a lot of information in it, but it was worthwhile. The test wasn't that hard, but I was very confident thanks to the Barron's CBEST book."
3,Dream Stomper,This book came in real handy when I decided to get drunk the night before the CBEST test which I then used as an excuse to skip it in the morning. I never went through with my plans on becoming an elementary school teacher.True story.
5,Brilliant,"I love this book. It's so rare that you find an easy to read thriller that has pace and style and balances a clever plotline with interesting characters.David Braun is an investigator, bored by his job, who gets involved in an unusual case. He seeks the help of Susan, an expert from the London School of Antiquities, to help him answer some of the puzzling questions. The interplay between these two characters and their developing romance is a perfect foil to the unravelling of the mystery. I won't give too much away about the story because it's truly original and it would be a shame to spoil it at all. However, I particularly liked the balanced way the story and characters developed around each other, with both of the main characters coming to understand that they couldn't control everything in life. A really rewarding, clever, imaginative and thrilling discovery."
2,A bit silly,"Finn tries really hard to not be silly, and he almost succeeded. But there was just too much cartoonery and unlikeliness. If it were possible, I'd raise him to a 2-1/2, because it was borderline."
1,Save your money,"This book was truly terrible. The plot was lame with major inconsistencies. The villain had no master plan and posed no threat to society - so why do our heros have to kill him? The writing was pretty bad to boot. The action scenes were completely impossible to figure out what was happening, so I just ended up skipping over them. The dialogue was corny also. If you want a good thriller, this is not it. The only redeeming quality is that it was only about $1.99 on a bargain basement table."
3,I found this book quite useful,"I cannot completely agree with Mr. Bain assessment. Complete is a relative term. Upon reading this book, it was my interpretation that the author expected the student/reader to have a certain familiarity to anatomy. This book successfully ties together the constructive aspects of Bridgeman, and the gestural nature of Nicolades to create a more refined drawing.Certainly, there was more I had hoped to see in the text. Myself enjoying Mr. Robins work, I truely desired for a more intimate view over his shoulder, so to speak. But for a guide to tying up loose ends in figure drawing techniques this book is a success."
2,Drawings are not very clear or well done,"I bought this book, because I heard that it was published by an artist here in Cincinnati.I am an artist, and I found the drawings to be flat and undescriptive. I also found the text and concepts to be somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow.I hate to admit it, but I am thoroghly disappointed that this is a book which represents some of the artists here in Cincinnati.I think it is not a good choice for any art library."
3,"Too large, too loud","Was hoping to find a fan to clip to bedside to provide comfort while sleeping, however, this fan's two settings made it such that it would either blow too little or be too loud and intense. Its size also proved difficult to deal with.In the end, I found thatHolmes HACP7W 7-Inch Clip-On Personal Fanwas what I was seeking."
3,Far from perfect,"The rachet like positioning is too far apart between settings. Maybe it's needed due to stability / rigidity of the whole unit. But I wish many times that there was in-between settings.The I/II/OFF switch should be replaced by infinite-control rheostat for a long time already. Every one finds I too weak & II too powerful/noisy. Can't believe that Vornado is still doing this in 2010.Otherwise, this fan is very well-made, II is very powerful. Wind pattern is one-of-a-kind Vornado-ish. But it's far from perfect."
4,Great Fan!,"Bought this fan for our kitchen since we don't have central A/C. Works great to cool things down a bit. Only issue was because of it's size it doesn't clip to the cabinet lip on the bottom of the top cabinets, so we clip it to an open cabinet door."
2,WARNING!! Don't be fooled! This isn't quiet!!,"Ok I just got this loud little fan, the install was easy and that was it! I should have listened what others have said about the noise level.I was expecting a lot about the noise because in the advert, it says bloody 'whisper quiet'!!!!!!!!!! for mother of airs. Seriously, who whispers like this loud? I can't even hear my own voice when I turn on the full speed.It has 2 speed control buttons, low speed is just acceptable if you place it close to you but then the noise level is not quiet at all. And you don't even wanna touch the button of high speed or I just wanna call it Tsunami. It's so bloody loud whisper that if my window was opened, my neighbours can hear that i turned on the fan.Pleeeeeease consider this carefully when you buy and don't be fooled by the word 'Whisper Quiet'. Cuz that whisper could make you a deaf."
2,shamanic?,"After listening to this CD, I feel like I have been cheated.This CD has none of the shamanic sounds that the name implies."
3,Excellent amp......sort of!!,"I was thrilled by the performance of my 520 when I first got it. I was powering some relatively efficient energy eXL 26 towers and they sounded great. However, I recently upgraded to the Veritas 2.4 from Energy and the 520 doesn't even come close to providing enough power for these speakers. At moderate listening levels the bass is almost nonexistent. If you really turn up the volume, the bass does emerge somewhat but who wants to crank their music just to hear a balanced sound? I plan to upgrade to a very serious power amp. Bryston 14B ST. with 500 watts per channel. My Veritas speakers should really sing. One positive thing about the 520 is that it does a masterfull job with 5.1 surround. Movies sound awesome with this reciever. If you have high end speakers you will be disappointed with the two channel performance of the HK avr 520. Good Luck!"
1,"30,000 Leagues",Don't waste your money on this.The acting is terrible and never should had been made!The plot is very very thin and down right stinks!
5,Martha always knows what she's talking about,"Great short story before bed, the book's pictures are bright and the type is easy to read. My nephew will enjoy these Martha books for years, just as my son has for the 6 yrs we had his."
2,Carrying case too restrictive for cord.,"The carrying case that came with mine when I ordered it with my HP laptop is too small to give the DC out cord room not to get a kink in it. Actually the cord is really a weak point in the whole adapter. It would be better if it was removable so as not to be so easily frayed. Which is why I need a replacement. And yes, sometimes you do forget to push the button when you plug it in and wind up with a laptop with a low battery when you thought it was charging."
3,"Campy, and Humorius","I do not write reviews, but as this movie had none ...I remember many such movies in the drive-in movies during the late 60's early 70's.Hardly worth a R rating now, but at the time they were racy. This one was a good one, for humor and 60's flower girls that were semi nude, never obscene or pubs showing, and sorry not even close to soft core sex.If your up at 1AM and want to see what 40+ years ago was considered sexy; and or like campy humor this will do. It did have some funny moments and a little T"
2,Very poor plane,"the cheapest plane that you can have!!! It is made of a poor foam quality, and when your plane is completely build it is not sturdy at all!. You will need to complete this kit servos esc and other wires... I would not recommend this one if you you've just commited in the hobby."
5,Five Stars for a Quality Product,"I build foam airplane kits and make Youtube videos - userID in Youtube is theleabres. I've build over 20 foam kits. I have this P-51 kit and it assembles well, the pieces are molded nicely, and no doubt she will fly well. I will post a comment to this review after the maiden flight."
5,wonderful!,"this health guide is explinig in a very practical way and easy instructions to follow the way herbs are helping to boost the immune system.the author givesa few ways and explains also how to prepare them at home.after that he talk about a few common immune deficient diseases such as c.f.s\candidiasis\fibromialgia and more.a very healthy list of healthy and immune boosting foods wich the author explain in interesting way.the whole guide is wonderful,i recommand it!"
3,??,"Some people seem to be very satisfied with the book, and some are very disappointed... I haven't bought the book so I don't know, but there can be a possibility that the people involved in selling the book (the people in the company that published the book) may come to the website & write the ""5 star rating"" comments here.. i mean, who can tell? Besides, the epiphyseal plate closes at around 18years of age. Based on textbook material, one should not be growing any taller after the plate closes. I didnt' buy the book so I don't know.. it might actually work... but I don't really trust it enough to buy it."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"First of all, there is no proof that he grew up, then the company in New York charge you and then they dissapear...I tried to call them and there's always ""We are going to call you back"" for an answer...They are all a bunch of liers..Don't be that stupid to buy somenthing that really does not workAn advice from a friendDON'T BUY IT!"
1,i'm not sure anymore,i'm not sure if i want this book anymore. most of the reviews have like amazing results but some are just like boos and downers. i'm 16 and 4'10'' and dont wanna be cheated of my money. i want to know exactly if this book works or not before it get it. please e-mail me at AveXazN@yahoo.com if you think or dont think that this book is useful.
3,Growing Taller Secrets,Ive read all the reviews and I still dont know if I should get the book. If you can help me decide please E-Mail me at flaming_rainbow@mercury.aliens.com
2,Lets be realistic,"Lets be realistic all around shall we?Firstly, if you are 30 years old and expected to grow more than 1 or 2 inches from doing the techniques in this book, you are out of your mind.From what I have discerned this book is designed to manipulate the current structure of your body so you appear taller.There are several easy techniques you can do for free or for small cost.Yoga or Pilates is a very good way of stretching out your spinal cord, strengthening the associated tissues, and improving posture. All of which could translate into an inch or 2 of apparent height.Proper hydration could result in an apparent increase in height. When we wake up in the morning we are actually a little shorter than when we laid down because the water in the spinal cord is no longer there.Very diminutive height is caused largely in part by genetics and life style, or sometimes as a result of HGH deficiencies, I recommend you consult your doctor and leave the hair-brained books on the shelf."
2,Did Any Men or Women took the road no one did?,"Hey guys, I've read the book. It seems like there's a lot of work involved. I don't mind paying the discipline but I would love to build my body right now also. The book teaches you not to grow your muscles big so it's going to be a huge sacrifice to me if i follow it for 2 years and find out in the end it doesn't work. I'd rather spend that time for my body then.However, I do believe in reasonable time like 1 year to see result. So i wonder if anyone could please email me at mdsanguyen@gmail.com and lemme know if there is any man or woman out there, who has gone the road no one is willing to go before and got some result? Please send me some picture proof too if you have it. Thank you so much and hope to get something in the mail soon."
1,look carefully,"Notice how all the positive 5 star reviews are the only reviews written by those ""people"" it's just the seller himself getting on different computers and giving himself positive reviews.Please don't fall for this. If you feel like you aren't pursuing all the opportunities in your life, looking for random hoaxes on how to grow taller is not the way. Best wishes to all of you"
4,"Woks, sorta","Well I didn't follow the instuctions completely, because you would have to have no life to follow the instructions in this book. Any one with a full time job or children should not buy this book to grow taller.This is book is however excellent for health and fitness. It has amazing help tips that are good for WAY more things that growing taller. I did change my diet and exercising and way of thinking because of this book.It had many wonderful effects on me, however height was not one of them.So if you have the time for this book, get it. If not, buy heels."
4,The Power of Belief,"The bulk of this 53-page book provides several stretching exercises accompanied by imagery, posture, a list of nutrients that may help in releasing the growth hormone, and the effect of fasting and sleep on growth. While the exercises and proper nutrition are certainly good for your health, it is unlikely that you will increase your height unless you engage the power of your imagination.The author points out that ""the most powerful way to grow is to believe you can do it"", and this is absolutely true, yet he does not provide much information about this crucial element (that's why I gave it only four stars).In 1960's, Dr. Milton Erickson, a well known and respected hypnotherapist helped a 20-year-old man to GROW 12 INCHES IN HEIGHT IN THE SPAN OF ONE YEAR - with hypnosis.(...)If you are already using Robert Grand's program, you can find out how to use hypnosis to accelerate your progress."
3,Growing Taller Secrets,"A little advice to those who think that just because a book has more pages it's supposed to be better. GET A CLUE!, as long as a book doesn't have any fluff and filler and gets straight to what we bought the book for in the first place, it doesn't matter if the book is 20 pages. I'd rather read 50+ pages of hard, effective info, than having to read a book that's over 256 pages with over half of it being BS fluff. Bigger and longer is not always better."
2,GROWING TALLER,"I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CLAIMED TO GROW TALLER FROM USING THIS BOOK. DOES EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY MATCH WITH YOUR HEIGHT, NOW THAT YOU'VE GROWN TALLER? INCLUDING YOUR FACE ALSO. DOES YOUR FACE MATCH WITH YOUR BODY NOW?..."
4,Thank you Robert Grand! I'm three thousand feet taller,"Thank you so much for your incredible secrets Robert Grand! I used to be a pathetic ""shrimp"", but since reading your book, I've grown three thousand feet taller! Hold on, major cities of the world, here comes the bottom of my foot!"
1,Money back guaranteed? you never get your money back!,"I returned this book back and waited for a check or a credit and never heard from them until I had to email THEM about it. Then received a check in the mail just to have it BOUNCE! I emailed them several times and never heard from them again. Don't buy this book if you don't have the time, the ""secrets"" are to hang from a chin bar, stretch, eat right and jump around all day. So if you don't have time to do that don't buy it cause you won't get your money back."
1,Garbage,"I wouldn't line my birdcage with this garbage. Some of these glowing reviews (written in the same broken english), claim ""I gained 7 inches in 3 months!. Come on. Does anybody real believe that? Please don't pay all this money for a flimsy 50 page pamphlet. This peice of fluff basically just advises to do a few basic stretches and calisthenics and drink some protein shakes. Oh yeah, and it doesn't work. You won't gain 1 inch with this book. Not even a 1/4 inch. It's trash."
2,this wont make you grow taller,"Guys, there is no doubt that this book will improve your physical fitness, but i dont think this book will make you grow taller. If you all go to Robert Grand website, you will realise that he says that he has grown 6 inches after trying those exercises that he drew in the book. The question is: where is the evidence of his 6 inch growth. Why doesnt he show any photos of him which proves he grew 6 inches. His so called secrets are not even secrets. If you go to the gym you will realise that most of his drawings in the book are already their. Plz dont buy this book. You are wastin your dreams of growth."
5,"'Growing Taller Secrets""","For about three and half months ago I tried your product and really didnt believe it would help me.But when I started, after 1 month I realized I was growing fast. Before I tried this I was just about 5""9(~1.76cm) and after 3months I was about 5""11(1.82m) so thank you! I didnt really believe this would work so well. thanks to you Robert you've made my life completely different. Now I get all the looks in places I go to, It is so nice that people now see me and they notice me different from times before. Thanks again.Anton Redbury"
1,the solution is simple! for those of you can't decide,"if you really want to know, why dont you just call upthe number at the company and talk to the author himselfif it's possible and also to see if the company exist!!!! stop pondering! u can get the company add and number at... ....only if u really want to know beforebuying the book, i mean sometime some of these things are just adtervisements to fools the public eyes, so you really dont know you are dealing with...just be careful! beside if this books really works then it would be widely spread among the public along time ago already in television and shows...dont u think?however not everything work for everyone, it might works for some and it might not work for others...."
3,Is it worth it?,There are so many good and bad reviews for this book. Could people who have had/haven't had results please e-mail me at Bugaroma278@aol.com and tell me about you're experience? Thanks.
3,Don't Know!,"I'm in the edge of buying this book, i don't if i should really buy or not. Am not clearly motivated to buy this from all the reviews i ahve read. But if someone could please e-mail me more deep information on the book or highly recommend any book on growth, i will greatly appreciated for the time spent to write it to me. thank you so much!"
2,Content is from www.growtall.com,I think that some of the content in the book may be stolen from sites such as www.growtall.com and www.growthscience.comNot sure but maybe.
5,Straight to the point,"I was using another book for almost a year. It was a disaster for me, I did not know what to do because of too much information which looks like a bunch of information from different sources combined together with no knowledge about the subject. In anyway it did not help me. This book is whole different story - simple, step-by-step and easy to follow. Now I know exactly what to do. I recommend it."
3,should I buy this book?,"hey i read some of these reviews and i'm not sure if i should get this book because i'm still not that sure if it would work and if it's worth my money if it is tell me why and more about it, if you could please email me at theman5785@yahoo.com.Thanks."
1,does it work please let me know,does this book actually work for anyone? please email me and let me know your results on snowgirl262002@yahoo.co.uk
3,Growing Taller Secrets,Ive read all the reviews and I still dont know if I should get the book. If you can help me decide please E-Mail me at Flaming_Rainbow@mercury.aliens.com
3,UNSURE???,"I am 6'1 age 17 and I would like to become taller by 2-3 inches at least. I have reasearched so many websites on becoming taller and I have found Robert Grand's book, Growing Taller Secrets. However, I am not sure if i should or should not purchase this book? Please email me at frasulza@yahoo.com with helpful comments. Is this book on kazaa for download? Your comments would HELP a LOT.Thanks,Jimmy"
1,Is this true,I am thinking about buying this book but am a bit sceptical. It really does seem to good to be true...if someone could email me because I just don't know and don't really want to waste money or time on something that is not going to work!
2,Disappointed,Inconsistent. Several pops had very smudged details on the face so when I began distributing them at a party they weren't useable.
5,incredible!,"Man, what a beautiful soul this guy has; we are blessed to have Matisyahu with us. Check out Matis with the PS22 chorus ,on you tube clip, singing ""one day""."
5,Superlative and profound,"Anderson takes agile development, which is a loose-leaf collection of unintegrated practices, and transforms it into a serious discipline with a firm foundation. He accomplishes this by borrowing concepts from manufacturing (like theory of constraints) and applying them to software development. Such a book could only be written by someone thoroughly familiar with both software development and manufacturing; fortunately the author seems quite knowledgeable about both.In all, this book is serious, contentful, and even profound at times. It is by far the best book I've read on the topic in quite a long while."
4,The Missing Link,"Ignore the 4 stars, that's just because I feel the subject can and will get a better book, however this book has paved the way.I've been looking at and reading about agile methodologies for a long time, and there has always been something missing, and that is how they can be tied in with known business management science. The measurement problem, and in particular, the measurement of software development _value_ hinders any attempt software development staff might make to change processes based on their knowledge of development alone. This book offers a clear way forward in breaking down that problem. It doesn't solve the problem by any means, but we should all hope that it is the start of a deeper insight into the costs and values of development that will allow all of us to measure and justify methods (agile or not) in business terms.Read it, and get your boss to read it if you can."
5,"Awesome, best country record ever, BUY it now!","Folks, do yourself a favor...If you like original, absolutely perfect live country drunkedness, without a tiny slack in musical talent. This recording is simply one-of-a-kind special. I'd spin this before Buck, or Dwight, or any of that crowd (and believe me...I love Buck big time). I'm just a little sad that no one else is excited about the Pistols to write about them. The other cds are great also. I've bought them all...and I can't stop listening Discover them NOW...don't wait another second"
5,Kitten book,"Very readable and informative. Could use some more detail in sections and maybe a little updating. The best part of the ordering process was the very competitive price, the excellent condition of the book and the speed with which it was delivered."
5,Top Notch Bag,"I have used Tamrac bags for going on 30 years for my extensive collection of Film & Digital cameras and lenses along with a camcorder or two. My most recent addition, the Messenger 1 bag, is a good fit for my new Lumix FZ28 camera. The bag has room for a charger, extra battery, several memory cards, cords, owner's manual, ETC.The most important thing to remember when looking for a bag that will FIT your camera is to access the Tamrac website. They have a chart listing most all cameras on the market and the recommended bags that will fit. There are usually at least 5 different types, plus several colors, to choose from.Their bags are well thought out and always of top quality."
3,Average camera bag,"Basic, no-frills bag. The case is adequate for storing a DSLR. My Nikon D90 fit (tightly) and I was left unimpressed with the coarse materials used in construction of the bag, both inside and out. The overly tight fit and the rough materials has left me a little concerned that my sparkling new D90 is not being protected as much as it could be. These features, combined with an unpadded shoulder strap, have led me in search of another bag. I am returning this one unused.Just to be clear, the bag is not poorly made. In fact, it's probably right on par with the pricing. Just not quite what I envisioned.I would recommend this bag for those more concerned with bargain pricing than comfort and plush materials."
4,Gift Purchased from Amazon,"I purchased this as a started case from Amazon for my daughter for christmas. She likes it. The compartments are padded & the outter zippered pocket for ""extras"" is really handy."
4,the book was not the best but it was still a good book,"Tunes for bears to dance to by Robert Cormier is about a boy named Henry. Very early in Henry's life his brother died of pneumonia and that left his family in shambles. His father became depressed and started gambling again. His mother had to support the family so she got two jobs. Henry also found work as a stock boy at the hardware. One day when he was walking home from work he saw an older man that was talking to himself, so Henry decided to follow the man home. Henry later finds out that the man is a survivor of the holocaust and he was the only one left in the family. He was carving his town that was destroyed in the war. I thought that the book was good but it was not the best that I have read. The book has wonderful detail of the characters. It seemed that the characters were in realistic situations."
3,Touching but Predictable and Short,"The book really touched me when the characters talked about the Holocaust and how Mr.Levine survives, but I knew what was going to happen next. The book ended too abruptly. I AM THE CHEESE, though was a better book, with an EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY unexpected ending. THAT is certainly a GREAT book."
4,Tunes for bears to dance to,Very good book. The author elevated our interest well with the story as well as the emotions it carries. My son and I both enjoyed it.
3,Tunes For Bears To Dance To,"The book was very interesting. The characters helped a lot to, each of them helped make the book even more interesting. Mr. Levine with his little wooden village, Henry and his curiosity (it's a gift and a curse), and Mr.Hairston, well it wouldn't be that interesting of a book if everybody was nice. Mr.Hairston did help to spice things up a little bit with his little scheme and his always moody attitude. Other than the ending which I thought was rather sudden, the book was in all pretty good."
1,It sucked!!,"This book had nothing to do with bears, or tunes, or bears that dance to tunes......they should call this book, troubled young boy with an Mallot who ruins and poor old man's wooden house.That is VIOLENT right there ya'll!! It teaches people that it is ok to crush small wooden houses with mallots. that is such a chipmunk mentality....not something we want in our young children!! this book it an article of Paganism and shall be severly punished by the law."
3,Tunes for Bears to Dance to,"This compelling novel written by Robert Cormier is about a young boy, named Henry who moves to a new town after the death of his brother. Henry works at a grocery store. His boss, Mr. Hairston, hears about Henry's new friend, Mr. Levine. When Mr. Hairston found out that Mr. Levine was a jew he ordered Henry to ruin Mr. Levine's model village that he had worked so hard on. If Henry does not do what he is told his life would be ruined. Henry is faced with a very important decision. To find out whether he makes the right decision you will need to read the book."
3,Interesting,"This book really captures you. Once you start it is hard to put down. Some chracters were not developed enough. And the friendship between the main character and the jewish man was not developed either. The book lacks some awnsers to questions you may have. However, the idea, or theme of the story is very good and makes the book really worth reading."
5,Great mini series,"This was a great mini series that I remember seeing a long time ago. The characters have substance and are realistic, and most are very likeable. I think the settings, story, acting, etc. are all wonderful; an overall quality production. I just hope it will soon be available in a US format."
1,Against the Wind,"Unfortunately, my DVD player was not formatted for PAL, so I had to return this item."
1,Teacher: A Little Book of Appreciation (Miniature Editions),"I noticed this book said ""miniature editions"", but I had no idea the book would be so small! If I had, I never would have ordered it for this price, and I was a little embarrassed to give it as part of a gift, it was so tiny."
1,"Unreadable, cliche-ridden tripe","How come everyone has been hoodwinked by this Barry Hoffman? Is it because he publishes crappy editions of great works of literature? This book is a mindless rehash of every serial killer book you've ever read, and is the most poorly-written novel I've ever seen."
1,Leaves one unfulfilled.,"HUNGRY EYES is a so-called thriller that is really more of a character study. Although there are a couple twists much later on, there's no mystery or suspense. And like Dean Koontz, Barry Hoffman lacks any kind of flair in his writing. The prose is often clunky and reads awkwardly. This is a short novel, but tedious to get through. Remniscent of the trashy pulp novels of yore."
2,Light-weight puffery,"This book was dissapointing; from some of the reviews I have read, I expected a far better book."
3,Wrong Item and Color listed,The J228-8's are Red and Black not Blue as described and pictured here. You will receive the Red/Black handled ones instead and these are of lesser value than the Blue J2000-28's shown here.
3,Interesting but redundant,"This is an interesting book on belief and spirituality, with an emphasis on mysticism in religious faith. The explanation of mysticism is clear and separates that concept from the goofy and weird that are sometimes lumped in with it. The book is drawn from the author's sermons. The writing is clear, but would have benefited from better editing to lessen the amount of repeated material."
4,the only Grape compilation currently in print,it's well worth spending the big bucks to get the mind blowing 2 CD set of Moby Grape that's current out of print - but if can't afford that - or don't want to take a chance - this single disc set that's currently available from the UK is a nice introduction. Their debut album is a monster - (someone else on this website claims it's over-hyped - don't believe it. Also don't believe the theory that they only made one good album. their 2nd LP WOW is overall pretty solid (it as good what the Buffalo Springfield and the Jefferson Airplane were bringing to the table) and the later recorded really DO have their moments. So Cross Talk is actually really good - as it covers their whole 1960's career. You'll buy this on CD and then you'll begin looking for the original LPs...........
3,Looper-ed,"The essential Moby Grape is found on their first album. Don't quite understand why the whole thing wasn't included here. They cut a few things afterwards that were very good, and they were always a great band. ""Wow"" and ""Truly Fine Citizen"" are fairly weak albums redeemed by a few choice cuts. The now-deleted two-CD set on Legacy remains the only decent testament to this band. You can pay an inflated price for the first album on CD. Blame Matthew Katz for this, and for the generally shoddy treatment this group, who were sort of the Big Star of the '60s, receive these days."
1,....If You Can Stomach The Hysterical Cant,"I am a chronic pain patient who has found it nearly impossible to be treated for my problem by conventional M.D.s. They somehow think it is virtuous to be twisted by pain on a day to day basis rather than partake of the evil poppy. I found the chemistry cited in the book to be sound, but was taken aback by the anti-drug rant. Surely there must be better, less biased literature out there.I have to wonder if the publisher insisted the anti-drug rants be inserted in the book as a pre-condition to publishing. I wouldn't be surprised."
5,excellent,"its a excellent book on the alkaloids of papaver somniferum. its intented for those chemistry types in a way, not for someone who is interested in just growing the poppy. shows you how to extract thebaine, morphine and make heroin. elaborate extraction process for making oxycodone from the main precursor thebaine. a good book!!!"
2,Alot of info/ less of a book,The title basically says it all. The book is alot of information but very little is put together to teach a single thing.
4,oxy review,"not a beginers book. it has some pretty serous depths of chemistery in it. you have to know a thing or two about chemistery to understand this book. sadly no color photoes. as for its importance, it is indeed a book for the hope chest and could save lives one day. its worth every penny. i would say it is ideal for the bio-chemist, survivalist, pharmisist, doctor,heroin addict, or patiant. it has info that clairifies myths and sterotype about opoids. its backed up, documented, historical truth makes it priceless."
4,Slipper Socks,"I am very pleased to find this product. Finding anything with the Lions logo is very hard to find in my area. Also the socks are made the the USA! which is VERY IMPORTANT to me. The only thing I was disappointed in was the shipping costs. I realize shipping has went up, but $6.95 for 2 pairs of slipper socks seems to be high."
3,Super Reader,"This book is a little different, in that the superman depicted is in this case a supervillain. With his basic supermanipulationcharisma abilities he isn't throwing cars around, but can cause some really bad military conflicts.Set in the 23rd century, that are quite a few colonised worlds and a few different cultural/political groupings for him to cause havoc on as the Dorsai and others try to stop him."
3,Better Than Most of Dickson's Work,"I'm not a fan of Dickson's novels. I think his style lacks something, and he tends to try to make connections in his novels that I could never see, try as I might. He also tends to portray his heroes as perfect, infallible...in other words, not human beings, not someone you can feel for. However, the idea behind the Childe Cycle caught my attention even at 14, when I started reading his books. In SOLDIER, ASK NOT, I think he comes closest to actually letting a character display some emotion. Tam Oleyn truly displays human qualities (albeit, usually negative ones), and Jamethon Black is probably the most sympathetic character, in my opinion, that Dickson ever created. I still don't like the prose of the book, but it shows much more feeling than the others in the series, with the exception, perhaps, of THE FINAL ENCYCLOPEDIA."
3,A little side reading in the Child Cycle,"This book focuses on a key figure in Final Encyclopedia and Chantry Guild. For that reason alone it is worth a read. The book is a little dry and sexist otherwise, not as rich as the newer books in the series"
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this item to use under a poodle skirt. Well, it didnt do anything. I was expecting a poofier underskirt, but what I got was basically a skirt made out of tulle. It's not even slightly poofy. And when I put it under the skirt, it wasn't even even so it made my hips look all uneven and bumpy. I can't send it back, so I'm stuck with it. The stretchy part is made of some kind of crappy pseudo silk. Super cheap. Super unsexy. Pass on this item and go with something else."
1,Night Vision Junk,"This is the worst camera of any kind I have ever tried, even for the money it's not a bargain. I ended up buying an AgCam from a local dealer, it's a lot more money but it was worth every penny. This is junk and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, but the one I have is the best I have ever seen, go to agcam.net and see what is available in real hardware."
1,Dont Buy This! Its A Waste!!!,Its definetly not worth buying. Please dont waste your money. I am so pissed off with the quality and image. Its got the worst optics! i bought it yesterday and I am returning it today. and dont be fooled with the 10-30x magnification. it cant show you a clear image even on 10x
1,Same model 7-21,"While I only paid 15 $ on it, it's was truly a deal but you'll only get it to work OK at 7x . Double image becomes annoying anywhere behind 10x and it's very dark. If I would have paid any more money, I would have tried to give it zero stars."
5,Fun little kit,"Keep in mind that this is a kit and requires tools to put together. It took me about an hour to put this together, and its quite a cool little kit. It makes a clicking sound (like a card on your bike wheel) and plays sound effects when you hit the different colors [Red, Yellow(Green in Roulette, Green (Black in Roulette)] This would be a good tool for someone learning statistics like independent trials etc."
5,A joy to read,"A delightful book. You don't have to have grown up in small town Iowa in the 1960's to enjoy the authors many humorous tales, but it helps! It has been a while since I have chuckled this much over the printed page."
5,This is a great book!,"If you can stick with it, this book will really convince youthat evolution not only happens but can be observed in realtime! All it takes is a bit of patience on the partof the scientists involved AND the reader..."
5,Educational yet Readable,"I'm really glad I read this book. It tells interesting human stories while also detailing some of the most important field research in evolution. It's the sort of book which requires you to stop and think occasionally, but then you really feel that you have learned something. In particular I enjoyed learning the discussion of which aspects of evolutionary theory have been clearly observed and which have not."
5,A wonderful introduction to evolutionary biology,"We actually use this book as supplementary material in an Evolutionary Biology class for which I am a teaching assistant, so I've had the occasion to read it several times. It is amazingly well-written and illustrates some subtle and difficult topics with a rarely-seen/read elegance. I would recommend this to any student of biology, formal or otherwise."
5,Also a great introduction to evolutionary biology,"I have no training or experience in natural science, and still I couldn't put this book down. This book dispels myths (""Evolution"" is a theory all scientists agree on), gives a hard realistic look at field research (raising your kids on a rock), and demonstrates some fascinating evolutionary benefits of El Nino (finch mating frenzies). A great writer, and a great read."
4,A Galapagos Primer,"I am going to the Galapagos Islands in February, and The Beak of the Finch was on our suggested reading list. I was not familiar with the book, but I found it to be a fascinating study of evolution as a whole and Darwin's finches on Galapagos in particular. The book won a Pulitzer, so it clearly is well written and covers an important subject. The descriptions of the work done over many years by Peter and Rosemary Grant from Princeton are amazing. The details that must be tracked in trying to follow generations of finches on Daphne Major in the Glalapagos are just overwhelming, even though I have to admit that I found I was actually learning more about the little birds than I wanted to know. I highly recomment the book especially if you have plans to travel to the Galapagos Islands. I have no doubt that it has changed my perception of what I am going to see when I get there."
2,"Very informative, not the ""great"" story I thought it to be..","As I started this book I was very excited. A friend recommended this to me and I could not wait to read it. It is chock full of scientific testing, experimentation, and results of years spent on the Galapagos Islands studying. The book was wonderfully written and on the verge of a great read, but never quite ""got over the hump"" to become what I had hoped - something to recommend for everyone."
1,disappointed,I just bought this book and realized it was only the second half. please either give me a refund or send me the first half as well. If I had known that only half of the book would cost 23 dollars i would never have bought it.
2,Very Factual,"I was assigned to read this book for an Environmental class. The book was very informative, but also dry and slow. Some of the factual information was interseting, but for the most part i did not enjoy it, beacuse it seemed like a continual listing of facts on evolution."
2,The Beak of the Finch,"The Beak of the Finch, while being very informative for scientific reasons, did not flow very well as a story. The story starts out as an adventure with the Grant's in the Galapagos Islands. The impression was that it was to be a novel which tells a story, while in reality it was full of boring information about the finch. I give the book two stars for the experiments and evolution theories, but as a story it was not flowing. Overall, I did not enjoy the novel due to the falsehood of the story."
4,...,"This book was very good in showing how natural selection takes place. It was a very informative novel, and it gives the reader a very good understanding of evolution. However the book was very repetitive and the chapters did now flow well together."
5,"Interesting, as well as scientific","We visited Galapagos recently and saw the island where most of the story takes place, but were not allowed to land. Although visiting the islands gives you a feel for the location, it is not necessary to enjoy the book. The findings of the research on the finch beaks were very enlightening, explaining how evolution can take place quite quickly. The size of the beaks of the finch would fluctuate back and forth, depending on the climate. It is explained very well."
5,Attention to details pays off,"This is a most engrossing account of the nuts and bolts of the detailed field research required to document the real-time action of natural selection on a specific bird species, in this instance Darwin's finch on the Galapagos Islands. The dedication of Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues to their work borders on the super-human. This book has helped me gain a deeper and richer understanding of just what exactly is meant by the term 'natural selection'."
5,Enjoyable and Enlightening,"This book is a well written and enjoyable text that makes the science of evolution understandable to everyone. The dedication of Peter and Rosemary Grant are inspiring. This book opened my eyes in many ways, including how fast dramatic changes take place. A must-read!!!"
4,The Beak of the Finch a delight.,"After reading the Beak of the Finch I cringe every time I hear about the slow pace of evolution. Beautifully written, giving insights into the character of the researchers who have painstakingly unveiled the wonders of life to the masses. Now when I look outside I can't fail to see a new landscape painted in hues of survival and change. A landscape which man has also trod. A delight!"
4,The First is the Best,"These are five essays previously written by Eco for various publications. Most of them are of interest to those who study European politics and cultural life. If you are not interested in the Italian press or post WWII Facism in Europe and are not familiar with some of the well known players, parts of these essays will make no sense to you.However, the first essay, ""Reflections on War,"" is worth the price. This essay was written about the first ""gulf"" war in Kuwait. Reading in now in a post-Iraq war frame is even more interesting. Eco predicts the neo-conservative view that active imposition of democracy by the developed nations will begin to occur in the middle east and elsewhere and he gives some brillant insight into this thinking.The other essays have thoughts worth reading even if the topics are not your cup of tea. Like all of Eco's work, this is highly readable and not at all obtuse."
3,Eco fans should wait for the paperback version.,"My wife gave me this book as a gift. I love Eco's writings, so I immediately began reading these essays. Be forewarned - if you are an Eco fan, you have probably already seen parts of this book. One of the essays was even included in last year's Belief or Nonbelief?Wait for the paperback or check this out at the library. Unless you're giving it as a gift, Five Moral Pieces isn't worth the price."
5,REALLY GOOD!!!,"i love this cd!! i kind of bought it on a whim after listening to her songs on itunes, but i am really glad i did!!! the lyrics are great and she has a really good voice!!!"
5,Amazing,"Finally Out of P.E. has become one of my favorite cds of all time. There is not one song on the CD that I don't like. Brie Larson is incredibly talented. She has an amazing voice, writes her own music, plays the guitar and the piano. Not many young stars out there do all of that. I would definitely recommend it!"
5,awesome!,"Brie Larson is an amazing singer and songwriter, and her efforts really show on this great debut album. Everyone knows that Brie is a great singer, but what many people don't know is that she also plays guitar, bass, and piano/keyboard! All this would be awesome as it is, but you also have to remember that Brie is just a 16 year old girl. If you like Hilary Duff, Aly & A.J., Ashlee Simpson or Kelly Clarkson, you will love Brie Larson! 'Finally out of P.E.' is a must-have album for rock and pop lovers alike."
4,BESTEST,"By far such a great cd. Extremely anticipated and finally delivered such a awesome cd. My personal favorite song on the release would have to be 'Shoebox', however it also contains hit singles like 'she said' and 'life after you'. Looking forward to new, exciting adventures with this young musician, best of luck to her."
5,The perfect blend of pop and rock...,"Brie Larson's debut CD is certainly not a disappointment. With 7 of 13 songs written by Brie herself, Brie Larson is definately making a name for herself in the pop music industry.This CD has a nicely balanced set of upbeat songs along with a few slower songs. An exceptional CD that you can listen to the whole thing without having to skip a single song.Besides the actual CD, the artwork and design is amazing. The whole school-theme is neat, and it comes together very nicely.Overall, it's definately worth the cost. A must-have for all music fans."
4,A pop album that appeals to a wide audience,"Brie Larson's Finally Out Of P.E., like other pop albums made by teens, has some lyrics that will primarily appeal to youngsters. But they are all well written, and some, like ""Falling Into History,"" have universal appeal. The music shows that Brie has an artistic vision that can be enjoyed by youngsters and adults alike. I am glad I bought it!"
2,Not really worth the effort to watch,"While this does have a lot of content for a very cheap price, the content itself is not really worth watching. The only film on here that is worth watching is ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The others, such as Go Hugo Go, are poorly mastered. Go Hugo Go is the worst of the bunch. It is poorly cropped to fit the screen which cuts off a good deal of the edges of the pictures which means you lose words and not just images.Really, I gave the 2 stars because I did enjoy ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The others are a definite miss."
3,Kid doesn't watch any of them,what I thought would be hours of entertainment virtually turned into 0. my kid doesn't like them (they're for younger kids).
1,I am a little skeptical,"This book is interesting. Rather reminds me of a wonderful book I read years ago about the lost continent of Mu.... Maybe everything in the book is true -- but I am not sure who Mr. Callahan is? Is he just writing opinions, or is he a scholar in the field?? I couldn't tell... Absolutely zero credentials were listed. For all I know, he is a street cleaner (no shame there) with interesting opinions, but no training in judging legitimacy of sources. All of that would be OK, but since the book is put out by the Skeptic Soc, I believe that it is reasonable to be a little skeptical. Right?? No matter, however..it is a fun book, even if rather unoriginal."
4,Really a must have for the biblical scholar,"One. Great. Book.I liked this book tremendously. It was a great read with so much information I'm still digesting it a month and a half after I read it. This book did not get five stars for one reason. Some of his assertions seemed a bit tenuous to me. Either they did not come across strong enough or else he was so erudite that I couldn't follow the point he made. I don't really think it was the latter, but I can admit he is more expert in this than me so it is possible. At any rate, he makes his case often enough that this is really a great add to any collection."
5,Fabulous.,"A must read for anyone interested in comparative mythology or history.Scholarly yet clear, respectful yet pulls no punches.Will be gracing my bookshelves for years."
4,Secret Heart,ReviewThis book was about a boy named Joe Maloney and how he was not made for this world and how he was so much different than everybody else. One day a circus comes to town and Joe goes over to see what its like. As doing so Joe sees a beautiful girl named and realizes that he has fallen in love with her. When Joe goes to sleep that night as done he is watched by a lion in his dream. Joe realizes that he is more at home more than he has every been before. I thought that this was a very well done book that i would recommend to children of all ages. This book was definitely a book that you could read over and over again to anybody.
2,Secret Heart,The Secret Heart was an ok book.The one thing that I did not like about my book is it had nothing to it and was always talking about a tiger.This book was about a boy a girl and a tiger.They were the main characters.I chose this book because it looked like a mystery so i picked it out.It was ok in some parts but most of it I did not like.I thought it was more of a grown up book. In my book they all lived in Helmouth which was a boring town that nobody or anything ever came to this town except for one when a circus came. The circus was right behind his house so Joe saw it as soon as he got up.When he was walking to school he met a girl in the circus who did the balance beam. Joe kind of likes this girl so he invited her to his house and that is all I am going to tell you. That is my book review.
4,"Excellent, if a bit euro-centric.","This is an excellent text as an overview of the last century. Much more concentrated on the people than on politics, it provides a different approach than the other ""millenium"" history books."
1,A waste of cast iron,"Very poor quality. The ways were machined poorly (very rough and uneven machining with lots of chatter) and the adjusting screws were cheap. I was unable to get the excessive play out of the ways, even after much tinkering. There is also a lot of end play in the lead screws, especially the bottom axis. The bottom axis on my vise slides back and forth about 1/8"" without turning the lead screw. This makes it almost impossible to position anything in the vise reliably. After taking the vise apart, I noticed that one of the adjustment shims was drilled completely through so the adjustment screw wasn't pushing on the shim, but directly on the way itself. I was going to bring the whole thing to my relatives machine shop to re-mill the entire vise, but I think it would be easier to build a whole new vise from scratch instead of fixing this one. Don't waste your money, no matter how low the price."
5,great vise for the money,"This vise is completely different that the Harbor Freight cross slide vise or any of the other cheap ones. It has adjustable gibs on both slides, so you can take any play out of both of the cross slides. The micrometer indicators are kind of hard to read, but it's easy enough to set up an indicator with a magnetic base to read the distance.I took mine apart before using it and filed/sanded all the surfaces that touch. Some of the ways were a little rough, so Im sure this helped. Some of the liquid coating that covers that casting dripped onto the ways, so I scrapped that off before sanding and filing. I then coated it with regular synthetic oil (same lube I use on my mini lathe) and put it back together. There is no play at all in either direction.For $38, this blows the $50 harbor freight vise out of the water. They aren't even in the same category."
1,"Looks cool, but bad machining","Beware, the price is cheap and you get what you pay for. The machining was so poor that there would be no way to get any accurate milling. I returned the item although the shipping was almost as expensive as the product. Kudos to the seller for refunding the item and their shipping. Bottom line - heavy junk, might work as a boat anchor."
5,Great introduction to wildlife for preschoolers,"My preschooler loves Ladybug, another periodical (with more of a language arts theme) for young children, and when I came across Zootles, I decided to give it a try. Zootles is a bimonthly publication and is a great magazine focusing on wildlife. The magazine is ad-free which is a great bonus in my opinion. Each publication features a particular animal, for example pandas, and the entire magazine (for those two months) has interesting facts about the pandas, covering their habitat, the panda babies, how they play, their diet, and a short story featuring the panda. The magazine also has a 'fun pages' feature which comprises fun activities like coloring, drawing, and other learning activities.There are plenty of full-color photographs about the featured animal as well as beautiful illustrations. Highly recommended for ages 3-6."
5,It BURNS!!!!,"For anyone who has acme, this product will greatly help clear your face within the first week. This is one of the only over the counter products that actually gives me a 'burning' feeling upon application."
4,Got the job done but...,"While using these pads I never had one breakout but... I was really looking for a product that cleared up my breakouts plus got rid of blackheads. While it kept away pimples, it didn't do as great of a ""pore cleansing"" job as I expected it to."
3,Pretty good but smell different and not the same as the picture,"I use these pads daily because they are easy and they work. However, I can't find them in stores anymore so I ordered them online at Amazon. The packaging is different from what is displayed here. I didn't check the ingredients but I'm sure they are pretty similar if not the same.The major difference I have found is that they smell different. Don't get me wrong the pads smell okay but just not as good as the old ones in my opinion. It's a small complaint but I probably would have bought from somewhere else had I known they werent the exact same..."
4,readable and real advice,"Too many trading books just push the author's own proprietary system. In this one Alpesh B Patel has nothing to sell, just plenty of personal experience to share (he's been there as a beginner; he started trading in his spare time as an attorney, and now also writes a net-trading diary column for the Financial Times newspaper). What we get here is a book that covers every base and carries the reader with it. Patel also pulls in expert tips form the pros - names like Pat Arbor and Phil Flynn - but what makes this one different is that he's also enlisted the help of the trading community in chat rooms and trading site to chip in with their experiences and trading lessons. A nice touch in a book that worked hard for me."
3,Fa,"I loved Fa when I was in Europe. The products here are different, nice, but about three times more expensive than abroad."
1,Sounds like a bunch of kids fooling around in the garage,"I expected something at the level of ""Do You Wanna Hold Me"" but I was very disappointed."
5,I've read them all and this is my favorite,Buechner is my favorite author. I've read all of his books and this is my favorite. It's great. Don't miss this treasure!
1,the son of laughter,"I'd advise not to read this book. Certainly don't spend money on it. Buechner's sole strength seems to be imagination. But so is a 7 year-old's. At times his writing seems pedantic. Other times like he's trying too hard to be poetic (using ""moors"" for hills near their tents - in Palestine!). I feel he goes beyond proper liberty-taking for even historical fiction (why make the three visitors to Abraham and Sarah into birds, of all things? Why make Isaac out to be someone suffering from PTSD?) Maybe worst of all is a juvenile 'potty' infatuation: three potty allusions in the first three chapters - a bladder incontinence by A. at the near-sacrifice of Isaac, 'droppings' by one of the bird-angels at Sarah's laughter, and the considered beard-pissing at the Esau-stew-birthright scene. Give us a break. My copy goes in the trash."
5,Nagashima book,"Awsome book, fueled my passion for making furniture. Actually leaned how to make Nakashima style furniture with this book. Sold over 100 pieces already. Great book."
2,Too much fluff,"I was looking for a book that would tell me the car and training, and although this book did have some, it was not to the extent I was looking for. I had read previous reviews saying what a great book this was for new Pap owners, but being a new Pap owner, it still gave way too much extranious information and even I knew some of it was incorrect just from talking to the few breeders I had talked to."
4,"Definitely worthwhile, if you can find one.","This book is excellent, wish it had more on the life changes of this breed of dog, but on the whole, an excellent overview."
5,I would buy it again,"brief history, temperament, grooming with pictures, training isn't very comprehensive, standard for America, Britain, & Europe with illustrations, little on showing, chapter on Phalene with pictures, collectibles, detailed chapters on champions in the world, breeding not scientifically oriented, good section on first aid"
1,Don't waste your money.,We gave this toy to our Grandson for Christmas after purchasing it from JC Penny catalog. He had just unwrapped it from under the Christmas tree when he started to play. The gear for the back-hoe arm stripped after about 2 minutes. All the realitives were watching in disbelief.
1,"biggest piece of junk- please don,t buy this backhoe.","This is the worst toy ever! I got it for my little cousin Georgie because he really wanted it. He was excited to get it. But after about five minutes, the backhoe stopped working. Georgie's Daddy took a look at it and tried to fix it. But he couldn't so he took it to the manufacture'rof the toy. Guy said, ""This is just a dead one."" Georgie is very unhappy. Daddy too!"
1,Not a great craft,"The mobile comes assembled and the only thing to do with it is decorate the butterflies with glitter glue and sticker gems - which is fine, but my kids (ages 5 and 6) even commented that there wasn't much to do. It came with 4 *small* tubes of glitter glue, not enough in my daughters' opinions. Luckily we had some more at home to finish the decorating. Some of the butterflies are strung upside down, as the prettier side faces the ceiling. The real problem with this toy though is that the strings get all tangled and it is pretty annoying to untangle - in retrospect I should have untied them and then restrung them. It is also difficult to get the mobile to balance properly - the strings slide on the metal bars making it lopsided. Another pointer if you do this craft - we laid ours out on newspaper and the glue goes right through the sheer fabric, so the butterflies ended up sticking to the newspaper. Not a great craft, but my daughters think the mobiles are pretty."
1,You can do better,"Book is full of errors. It says it is current with new tax law, but is not. It has two pages of new information, but dated informatiion is scattered throughtout. There are spelling errors, errors of fact and omission. Book hastily done. Surprised that Lasser put its name on book. Book is written for a 13-year old, but last time I checked, 13 years olds don't open 403.b accounts."
5,The 403(b) Bible,"""Winning with Your 403(b)"" is the most complete source of information available for getting maximum benefits from your 403(b). It's filled with helpful strategies on retirement savings and 403(b) management, and it walks you, step by step, through the 403(b) process - - from selecting the best 403(b) vehicle, contributing to it, and monitoring it - - up to and including retirement. Your nest egg will be be significantly fatter if you buy this book!"
5,A Must Read for Your Little One.,This is a great message for your child to learn. What could be more special then your child knowing that they are loved. Not only their Mommy's and Daddy's but Jesus also. It is beautifully written and illustated. The colors the artist chose are beautiful They are bright and cheerful. Which just adds to the message of that Jesus Love's Me!!!!!!
4,Cute sing-along storybook with sound chip that plays song,"This is an excellent tool to teach a young child one of the most popular children's Christian songs. It is beautifully illustrated, has a sound chip with the song and includes hand motions. Children and parents will enjoy the pictures and the music."
3,Not what I expected...,"...but cute. This book is an adorable little book for kids. Great price for what it is. I thought it was suppose to be an automatic singing book, but I was wrong. Book has the words of the song, so that's good. Just wish that it was automated like I thought it was suppose to be. My children love books, so this will be a nice one for our collection."
2,resistance as illusion,"What could have been an interesting book about the UT fiasco turned out to be a book wherein the author strokes her poststructuralist ego. Brodkey contradicts herself at every turn. This book includes silly essays like ""Modernism and the Scene(s) of Writing,"" which reveals that the essence of how the writers write is somehow key to the way we read books. In this essay, Brodkey claims that ""very few people [she knows] are positioned as well as [she is] to recognize the extent to which their lives are organized by writing."" This is just a small example of the condescending attitude she maintains, while trying to manage to get students to think on their own about how certain unquestioned ""truths"" come to light. The book has its moments (the student essays, ""Writing Critical Ethnographic Narratives""), but there are several moments in which you will want to throw this book across the room."
3,Very little about Kate - Was dissappointed,This is a documentary about Price William. Kate was hardly seen or mentioned. I thought I would see about thier ongoing romance. Was very dissappointed. Will have to try to purchase something else to try to get that segment....
4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice documentary of the royals. I was actually disappointed because I thought it was going to be another movie of the life of William & Kate, but still enjoyed it."
3,"Brief and Limited in Scope, but Well Presented","Perhaps a better title for this book would have been: The Penguin Atlas of Recent Mostly Military History: Europe 1815 to 1980. Much attention is given to military campaigns and political boundaries, but little is said of the populations within the borders, except when they are reduced to population figures. Since the book was published in 1982 and not updated since, you won't find any discussion of the important changes in the past two decades.The writing style is usually engaging, although the author has the irritating tendency to view nations' developments as a contest to attain the greatest levels of population and industrial production."
2,Deceptively fragile plastic parts.,"I loved the design, before pieces started breaking off with normal light-duty use running it on the bottom of the pool and cleaning a few harder to reach steps, I had found it to be a very handy tool for the price. The problem is it really only lasted a couple weeks, so the perceived value quickly diminishes, I had a more expensive counterpart from another company that lasted over 2 years so I had much higher expectations for this tool.The item is too cheaply made as evident by the price and quality of parts, invest a little more in something more rugged, I will be this time."
1,Horrible!,I purchased this product and have not been able to use it!!!! It came with no directions!!! I guess I could take the time to go on line to search for the directions but would it be too much to ask that it come with directions!!!!!
3,pool brush,"I needed a new pool brush, using water vacuum. I was not sure how to hook this together, when it was delivered. It had brush pieces and other clip ons...? , I just hooked on the brush pieces and cleaned the bottom of the pool. It looks nice and it is sturdy. Glad I bought it."
1,A Wandering Plot...,"This was a book that took me a long time to wade through. The main character, Jessica, seemed to have problem after problem happen to her. Over and over. I read the book only last month, and I've already lost the plot of the story. I'd recommend you read other Bryce Courtenay books before you read this one, so you don't think he can't write an interesting story. April fools day was an excelent book..."
1,Emerson PD6620 Single CD Boombox,"I bought this boombox for my daughter's 10th birthday and she loved it (while it worked). A few weeks later, the volume control stopped working -- it played so low you could barely hear it. We exchanged it for the same model, and a week later --the volume control stopped working. My daughter is (obsessively!) careful with her possessions, so I don't think it was anything she did. The boombox was a disappointment, especially since it was her ""big"" present."
5,The Seven Last Years,This book was truly good. I got hooked from the start and as I moved on to other characters I would wonder what the other characters were going through. Just couldn't put it down. Definitely a spiritual lift.
3,Truth Made Simple,"I liked Baer's thoughts. The book itself was a bit hard to get through--the language is very simple, perhaps a 4th grade level. I am also reading Jean Houston's books, where the language is graceful and elegant, complex and musical. In comparison, Baer's book became boring and repetitious. His words are the SIMPLE truth."
1,A waste of time and money,"The socalled real love described in this book is a sham. The author spends the entire book reworking his own past failures by blaming others for not giving him unconditional love--by which he means that he should have been loved and adored by those around him even as he acted out his own shortcomings and failures in often selfish and extremely hurtful ways. This book is not about real unconditional love, it is about one person's pathological need for enablers and co-dependents.If you are having difficulties in your relationship, find a reputable, licensed counselor."
1,Swinging from conjecture to lunacy.,"One of the worst books I've ever read. The book is full of erroneous logic, speculation, conjecture, and, at times, borderline lunacy!One star's too much of a rating.Granted, there were a few good points made in the book, but they could've been all summarized on one page... out of 200+.Giant waste of your money."
5,Should be the handbook for life.,"I can only think of one way of describing this book and it may not be the most eloquent. Reading it felt like having a very satisfying bowel movement after being severely constipated for years. Freud would, no doubt, conclude that I've been stuck at the anal stage, but this book is a miracle in print. It is beautifully written, straight forward, and a precious gift for any sagging soul. If I had only one book to read for the rest of my life, this one would be it."
4,Lacks depth but still worthwhile.,"Even though this is 'pop psychology' and oversimplifies the issues, I still found Baer's ideas were a kind of 'grand unification theory' of my relationship issues. Having been raised in a dysfunctional family, I only knew conditional love and it was a real revelation to find out that unconditional love exists. I do wish that there were more information for readers who are new to the concept about how to create such a relationship. If you have had or are in an unsatisfying relationship, I recommend this book."
5,Life changing,"This book has dramatically changed and healed my life. It is unlike any other ""self-help"" book out there. It has taught me how to be responsible for my own behavior and judgements. It has helped me understand, not excuse, myself and taught me HOW to find love and lasting happiness. My past and current relationships have become wonderful and I have much more love and compassion for the people around me. I recommend this book to anyone truly looking for happiness - take what you already know and Real Love will add the rest."
1,undisclosed violent graphic art on the cover,"undisclosed violent graphic art on the coverAlthough the purchase price was cheap, I still paid shipping for this book. I am taking a class in a church and feel this was unacceptable marketing of this particular book. It should have been thrown in the trash and not resold.I am guessing that no one that chooses to order and receive this book will appreciate violent, knife and blood images on the cover. I will never order books from this vendor again. If you care, I'd be happy to send you a picture of the cover graphics.Other than the defacing of the cover, the content is loving and powerful. I am sorry someone was so angry to do this to a gift meant in love."
1,Seriously? Really?,"Seriously? People are buying this? If that's the case, then I have several pieces of land in the desert that I'd like to sell you. In fact, Greg Baer is doing his best to sell his own ""crazy real estate"" to you in selling these books. Real Love is full of ""New Age"" philosophy and Baer's own personal philosophy.....none of which has any hard science or psychological worth behind any of it. Several questions: Was this author EVER a licensed therapist? Has he ever been through any training of any sort other than ""life's school of hard knocks"" due to his own drug addiction and failed relationships? Umkay....I didn't think so. A retired opthamologist? Uh, yeah. I think he'd write a better treatise on eye disease? Maybe?"
5,Completely Life Changing,"This book woke me up and changed my life, I see things differently in a way that allowed me to start taking steps to increase my happiness dramatically. Out of all the books I've read this one stands on the foundation of my life."
2,Oversimplistic,"While this book is very nice. I think it just oversimplifies human behavior. He essentially tells everyone to ""make nice"" and love one another. I don't think anyone should tell others that their emotions are ""wrong"" and he essentially says that anger is always wrong. I am glad that I bought it though. There were some real pearls of wisdom and a lot of ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" which I think is very helpful in any relationship. Pick your battles so to speak. Think before you speak. Be honest about who you are. All of that is good advice. He just makes it sound way too easy."
5,One good deed . . .,"I am quite pleased with the book I purchased entitled ""Real Love: The Truth About . . . "" This is the first time I purchased a Used book. Seeing that Goodwill was among the sellers made me decide to take a chance. The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition! I am only part way through it, but the contents of the book really make me take a step back and look at my relationships. Powerful stuff!"
5,Don't control your anger - lose it!,"In a very understandable format, Greg Baer presents a premise which we've probably always known - we can't change others, only ourselves. All the trying in the world won't make it happen; real change can only be achieved through acquiring a new and truer perspective. This shift of seeing people through another lens is so simple and the effect is so far reaching it will touch every aspect of your life. This can be achieved within minutes of beginning to read Dr. Baer's books. If you're ready to take your life and relationships to another level, this is the book for you. If you put these principles into practice you won't need to grit your teeth to control your anger because you won't ever experience anger in the same way again, unless you choose to."
2,All flash and no real learning!,"I bought 2 CDROMs from this company, piano for my kid and guitar for myself. Neither does a very good job of teaching. This one is by far the worse of the two. My biggest problem is the lessons are very scattered. You are expected to go from point A to point D, skipping B and C. The playback on the songs isn't very flattering, as it is MIDI with no real guitar sounds. The instructor is straight out of the eighties with his big hair, so if anything I got a good laugh."
2,Got this for my kids & not happy,I got this for my kids and am really disappointed. Frankly I hate it and feel ripped off. I can teach my kids more useable hands on guitar than this ever will and the kids immediately lost interst with it. Kids learn from songs they already know - and this thing has only three made up mediocre tunes to learn with. I saw a cd that had about 100 known songs on it for the kids to pick and learn - this wasnt the one! Wish I had wrote down the program so I didnt make the mistake.
5,AN ECLECTIC COMPILATION OF BULL FIDDLES,"Where else, I wonder, would you find Bobbie Leecan's Need-More Band on the same CD as Thelma Terry & her Playboys and Frenchy's String Band? That's just three little-known bands on the first CD, which covers 1925 to 1930. The second CD goes from 1931 to 1941, and includes Lionel Belasco, Milton Brown, Eva Taylor, and Bob Wills. The third CD concentrates on the output of bass player Bill Johnson, which takes in jazz, gospel, blues, and jug bands.There's a total of 79 tracks in this eclectic compilation, and each gets a page to itself, with photo, line-up, and commentary, in the accompanying 96-page book. All that's missing is details of the original 78 issue. It's a fascinating collection, beautifully remastered, which should be more widely-known."
4,A great Introduction To Mastering,"Having Completed a Sound Engineers course at SAE (value for money debateable), I picked this book up because of the poor teaching in the courses' lessons on Mastering. This book was exceptional with knowledge and some ""how to do's"" It also lists some of the equipment usedin Mastering. I found it very useful and was able to correct my Lecturers lack of knowledge and thus help the rest of the class. I have passed this book on to most of them and the lecture even wanted to read it. Not currently available in Australia.Didn't get 5 stars as there is a fair bit of padding out in the pages.Now my mixes sound so much better and the best reason is that I now know why.Excellent for beginners. I bought the whole series of three books and have read them all. I never regreted doing it and wish I had of done this earlier. Maybe spending the $10k on a course wasn't the best choice.Exceptional value for money!!"
4,"It is a good point, for to be a Mastering Engineer.","Before, I really didnot know how to work with my Audio Master, and any... but after i read this book (The Mastering Engineer's Handbook), i have many ideas for to do my works."
1,Save your Money for a microphone cable!!!,This book is $35.00 I'll never get back. Better off blind folding yourself and working your toe's.
2,"Interesting read, but out of date and not very helpful","This book does not outline the steps involved in the mastering process. It is just some interviews with different mastering engineers. Instead of talking about how they go about mastering a project or what they listen for, they brag about their cool customized gear and how little signal processing goes between the source and the final output. Yet at the same time saying how much they are improving the sound.You get the history of mastering.You get how they schedule their day.I was hoping for more of a real ""handbook""."
1,What a complete waste of space!,"What a complete waste of text! Want to learn mastering? Don't actually expect to learn ANYTHING from this book. You'll learn though on how mastering engineers complain and whine about the state of the industry.... and that's about it! Reading these other reviews makes me wonder if these people even read this book at ALL! The first review says the book is great, and that it tells you nothing! Wow, just what I wanted to spend my money on, nothing at all. No, one book will NOT teach you everything you need to know about mastering, but this book teaches you NOTHING about mastering, except 'less is more' philosophy. Ok, there you go, you just learned everything you needed from this book from me. In short, dont' waste your time or money on this book. Would you want to read a book on car mechanics saying that 'hey, forget about being a mechanic, it's too tough!' and then continue on for several hundred pages? This is what this book is!"
1,It should be called mastering for dummies,"what a bunch of ..., The first thing you read is ""I am not a mastering engineer"" WHAT?? All the book talks about is what gear to use and not any thing about how to do things. If you want to learn how to master this is not the book!"
1,Total disappointment,This toy flat out doesn't work. The kids had to practically press themselves against the screen to get any image at all. The photos on the package are gross exaggerations. Don't buy this toy.
4,Fun for all ages!,"I just got this toy for my kids, I specifically bought it for my 5 year old daughter, but my 16 year old son, and my 2 year old son are playing with it too! Heck, my husband and I are having a good time drawing on it! I have to say, it truely is a toy for all ages!"
3,I thought it was cool. Kids got tired of it quickly.,"I think this item is fun. My boys played with it for a while then tossed it aside. When friends would come over they would show interest again. I think it would be great for a party. The room needs to be pretty dark for it to show up. The item does what it says it will do. Like I said, I thought it was pretty neat."
4,Ummmm.....,"From the picture, I thought this would be bigger, but it wasn't. It works just as promised though. I used it in the classroom, and it got the reactions I was hoping for! My students really enjoy having this product in the classroom. It's easy for them to hold and use, and I don't see it breaking in the NEAR future. Again, the only gripe I have is the size, it's just too small for what I thought."
4,really cool album,The quality of the album was excellent and it didn't take long to get it in through the mail.
3,Admirable job,"Jazz guides are a dime a dozen, but this one does an admirable job of educating the reader."
3,All Music Guide to Jazz,"I found this book good when trying to fine an album, but disappointing because it shows albums which are not in print (sometimes not even explaining that the album is unavailable). The reviews are inconsistant because of the many critics. Also the star rating I found to be very confusing. The artist profiles are interesting and informative. The charts for each specific instrument are also interesting. I wish the personnel was identified for each album, then indexed like the Penguin Guide, which is a better quality publication when it comes to jazz CD guides. Overall good reading and a decent resource when looking for an album."
2,Give me a break,"While the information in the book is pretty good, it's presented with a very stuffy, holier-than-thou attitude. Why do some jazz writers have to be so stuck up? I much prefer the MusicHound Jazz book. It's written so people can actually *understand* it."
4,sehr gut,"Ich liebe auch PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST (""Die Tonleiter Pentatonic für der Jazz-Rock Klaviatur Musiker"") von Jeff Burns. (Sieht amazon.com.)"
5,Good product...,We use these in our idetiflyer alarm clock... A different bird sound chirps each hour and we change cards each week or so to keep the ambiance... we have a parrot and parakeet and they always stand to attention when they hear the different birds...
4,Works but lamp came broken,"Even though the box had no sign of damage, the flouresent 13w lamp was broken inside the box. Stacks and Stacks where I purchased it is replacing it however."
3,"Could be worse, but could've been a lot better too","Covering the classic material made famous during the Motown era is something that countless artists have attempted over the years. For some artists (notably Michael McDonald), it can be a beautiful thing. For some others, including Ruby Turner, sticking to your own material might be a better idea. To Ruby's credit, she's a stylish, bubbly and effervescent soul diva, but her average singing ability does not really do these classic songs justice, and this is made rather obvious by the fact that she actually called in some of the artists who made these songs famous to duet with her on some of them. There is some nicely-crafted, 80-style production here, however."
1,Not a good idea ......................,"Ruby is an OK singer, but this is a suicidal project. She recorded ten of the greatest Motown tunes in 1988, and every one of them sounds like a pale shade of the original.Aretha Franklin might be able to pull this off with inspired arrangements. But Ruby Turner? The exec who greenlighted this must have had an unusual agenda, or no idea."
5,Finally A Book,"You have heard of ""The Perfect Storm"" well I believe this to be ""The Perfect Plausible Purposeful Book""I have searched though books all my life and finally found a way to understand the meaning of life as we know it. This book by Robert Adams puts the puzzle of life together in a unique way."
5,Advaita Vedanta for the Experienced Practictioner,"i would strongly recommend Robert Adams' ""Silence of the Heart"" as one of the clearest and most pragmatic approaches to actualizing Advaita Vedanta as a practice. Realizing that Advaita Vedanta is a practice of no practices, Robert does a masterful job of describing many simple, practical approaches to ""Truth"", approaches that take one out of the habitual mind games and move one to directly face the reality of the present moment. His voice comes not from someone else's story, but from his direct experience as a reporter and observer of his own. All that Robert reports are what one does really find at the end of the approaches and they are reported with as much clarity and simplicity as possible. Strongly recommended for the experienced ""nondualist"" or meditator who has moved to the end game that is no end game."
4,Good CD--too many covers for my taste,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I'm very glad the Gentry albums are being re-released. I also think omitting ""ode to Billy Joe"" and ""Fancy"" was a good decision on the compiler's part. These songs were what introduced me to Ms. Gentry's work, but they are not the ones that get me buying CD collections. The truth is lady has an outstanding voice.My big complaint is 1/4 of this CD are covers--none of her treatments are bad. Bluntly, in the case of ""Stormy"" and ""Tobacco Road"" they are exceptional. I also enjoyed the Southern take on the Beatles' ""Fool on the Hill"" and ""Eleanor Rigby.""But as a whole, the singing and arrangement are exceptional. Ms. Gentry had a brief and very (IMHO) undervalued career, but she truly did know how to sing and how to turn a song to her own."
2,"Very, very, repetitive","""Dancing With Tears In My Eyes"" starts out great... but then gets horribly repetitive. The song should have been a little more creative. The lyrics are really, really short.This song could kick it up a notch with the proper remixes. Novaspace has a lot of work to do. They remixed Inoj's ""Time After Time"" and that wasn't much better than the original version. Hopefully, good things will come from them in the future."
4,Evil Cackles,"Christina is still fighting against the evil of the Shevvingtons, still trapped inside their formiddable home.A home which now comes with something extra...A laughing lunatic who hides in the attic.How will Christina ever prove the true nature of the hideous Shevvington couple?"
5,START with this book!,"As Patient/Family Education Coordinator for our hospital I spent a over a year learning ""piecemeal"" what is offered in a nutshell in this book. It also gives detailed ""Sources to Learn More"" at the end of each chapter. No digging for additional info - it is right there at your fingertips. I wish I had had this book when I first started in this postion. It would have been helpful in steering me on a more efficient path. You can easily just choose a chapter to read, but I ended up reading it cover to cover. While this would make a great text book (and should be required for anyone responsible for communicating health information), it is presented in such a way that it is an enjoyable read."
4,Great Product,"I just love the Tassimo machine- so easy to use and so quick to make a latte or Capp. The Gevalia Cappuccino was a little on the strong side, otherwise it was great."
5,Nice Mix of Styles,"I really like the mix of moves in this DVD. It served to keep my interest up. I have many Jillian DVDs (as well as a side selection of other offerings from other people) and I would count this as one of my favorites. I enjoy yoga, power moves, kickboxing, etc....and it is fun to throw a bit of it all into one workout!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I have a lot of Jillians workouts and normally she kicks ass literally!! I normally feel like i've done a hard workout and feel great about it, but to be honest this one has left me feeling a little ripped off. I have only done the level 1 so in all fairness level 2 may be better ....I also normally have to do the beginner option for a lot of moves cos they're just so tough, but this one I actually did all of the advanced ones and still left me waiting for the hard stuff.It also says there are two 45 min work out but she clearly says that there are two 30 min workouts and she recommends doing back to back for 60min workout ?? Not really impressed, I hope her next DVD is back to her best!"
1,not what it says,i wanted a longer work out and bought this for the two 45 minute work outs. But this is two 30 minute work outs.
2,Not my favorite at all,"Eh. I'm not a fan of this one. I like ""old"" Jillian DVDs much better. I'm in decent shape and this one just seemed to hurt my body. And not in that ""good kind of sore"" way, more in the ""I'm actually in pain"" kind of way. I stopped doing this DVD about 3 weeks after I started and haven't picked it back up again."
2,Stop Copying Jillian!!!,"I used to love Jillian Michael's workouts, but I am noticing that she is taking many of her moves from P90X or Insanity, both of which I already have.I am always looking for new moves and with her latest DVD's I have not found many.Plus her moves seem awkward. They don't flow smoothly. I can do without the Capoiera as well on this.STOP COPYING JILLIAN AND MAKE AN ORIGINAL DVD!"
1,Anthing but jillian - PLEASE !,This self absorbed fitness guru workouts are frenetic and not fun .... my workout partner and I used to joke about if she could wear herworkout pants any lower...
2,The Trouble with No More Trouble Zones,"I got this video because is was listed as among the more popular. Well her celebrity makes her popular to a lot of Biggest Loser fans. Yes, this is a very hard and intensive workout that will get you a toned body. I do not think all of the exercises are adequate but they were add to counter the harder ones. The problem I have with this video is that it is so-o commercial that she will even hawk electric toothbrushes as part of your ""health regiment."" I am finding that the greatest annoyance of all is her nonstop patter. A lot of videos have the star trainer demonstrate along with their crew members, Jillian will make any excuse to stop and point out what you should be doing so that she wouldn't have to do it herself and then she will laugh about the fact that she didn't have to do it! Luckily, they do offer a no-talk version with music only, of course you have to stare at the screen the whole time."
4,love her workout dvd,"Her technic are great and helped me to lose inches off quick. I did her video before I started ""Insanity""."
5,a very good workout,"I consider myself in shape. I try to jog/run at least 3-4 times a week and I am always willing to start new routines. I have done aerobics, step classes, kickboxing, lift weitghing, zumba, dancing classes, karate, body pump, etc. I think this is a really good workout, especially because it has a lot of moves to exercise the mid section of your body. I hope it brings great results because it is certainly hard to do. Regarding how fun it is, well, it is not fun, but it is great work!!!"
3,Not for the uncoordinated,"I am one of Jillian Michaels' biggest cheerleaders but this just fell short. I am an avid runner but I like to break up my routine with workouts at home. I own 30 day shred, BFBM and Trouble Zones (and a couple of Bob Harper's DVDs) and I was excited to purchase a new DVD. This was just plain weird to me. She didn't explain many of the moves and some of them required far more coordination than I have and I just fumbled around. All in all I felt it was a total waste of my time. I barely broke a sweat at all. I was disappointed because her DVDs I do own are straight forward, uncomplicated yet challenging. I am giving this 3 stars because I guess if you have good coordination you may enjoy this."
1,false advertising,"This video is not what it says it is. It is advertised at being two 45 minute workouts and it is only two 30 minute workouts. I have only done level one and it left much to be desired, I could have definitely kept going, but due to time constraints I did not continue with level 2. She also puts both workouts together into one. If I knew they were only 30 minutes, I would not have bought this dvd. I was expecting a much better workout from her. If you want real effective workouts, look at Bob Harper's dvds. Those are absolutely insane, but awesome."
5,Jillian Michaels Extreme Shed and Shred,"I have all of Jillian's videos except for Yoga Meltdown. This is, by far, my favorite of all of them. The option to combine levels 1 and 2 and make the workout over an hour long is awesome. I wish some of her others also gave this option. Also, there are so many new moves in this title that I feel like I'm staying entertained as well. Five stars!"
3,A bit bummed,"I love 30-Day Shred and Ripped in 30 and was hoping to add another good workout to my rotation. Extreme Shed and Shred won't be it. I did both levels together the first time through and felt like I needed to go for a run afterward just to get a good workout in. A lot of the moves don't seem necessarily hard, just awkward. I'll do it a few more times to see if I like it any better, but I think I'll stick with her other DVDs and Insanity."
5,Great Workout!,"If you are serious about getting in shape,this is a kick butt workout. It has variety so you don't get bored,but just remember to breathe lest you get dizzy. Level one is not difficult,but when you add level two to it, Look out! Have good sense and do the modified versions of the exercises until you get your breath back. Jillian aims to deliver what she promises,and she does. Love all her workouts!"
2,What Happened to Traditional Jillian Moves?,"Let me start this off by saying that I LOVE Jillian Michael's workout videos. I have 5 of them that I absolutely LOVE. This one- I HATE. I didn't even make it through the first circuit. She doesn't explain the moves, they go through them really fast, and she's started to incorporate moves that require way to much thinking, so that means I don't get as good of a workout because I'm so focused on what I'm suppose to be doing. I'm all for incorporating new moves but I'd rather do squats, curls and jumping jacks instead of bouncing around and running around in circles."
5,OMG I LOVE this DVD!,"I love this workout! Although I didn't at first -- it takes a few times before I really understood how to position my body. At first I thought that it was too easy, but I wasn't working hard enough. It is very difficult and interesting work out! I try to do Level 1 & 2 together, and although it is epic long workout for me (over an hour) it doesn't feel long. I'm always sore the next day. Very different for Jillian, but very, very good!"
3,Decent Workout,"I really wish I could give this one 5 stars but it just wasn't what I was expecting from a Jillian workout. I love love love Jillian Michaels though and her workouts always make me sweat! My favorite of her dvds is ""Get ripped in 30 days"". ""Extreme shed and shred"" is probably an awesome workout for people who are more into some of the different types of moves she incorporates but it really wasn't my style. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I had to stop a couple times just to try and figure out how to do the move. For me Workout 1 was not very intense but Workout 2 was much more intense. The reason I gave it 3 stars all comes down to the different moves that I personally am not familiar with. Jillian brings some kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and yoga moves to this workout so if you are familiar with these types of exercises or love trying new things and want a tough workout then this dvd is for you!"
4,Interesting,"I personally like this video. I am a big big fan of JM and find her work outs to be extremely effective. This video is as described it has two full length work outs that you can do by themselves or really push yourself and do them back to back. I found just the first work out alone to definitely be doable but still a challenge. The second work out is more challenging. I have not done them back to back however. I know a lot of people were put out by the fact that she does some new exercises. I liked the change of pace it's a good way to get out of the box of regular exercises. Although, I did find some of them to be a bit complicated. As for JM herself, I like her I have never found her annoying or mean, so I really don't have a problem with listening to her on a daily basis. Over all I am pleased with this video."
5,So far so good,"This is my first Jillian Michaels video and I got it to replace some work outs on days if I don't have as much time to put in a full p90x work out(I'm not a huge fan of the p90x cardio disk which is only 45 minutes). So far I really like it. I like that it can be a quick 30 minutes-ish workout that will get you working. I'm not a huge fan of the end where we lay down and listen to her rant. So I normally skip that. But other than that, I still give this 5 stars."
3,Jillian michaels tape,Was just okay...been doing beach body...so didn't seem as difficult..with alot of pauses between each workout...but did exercise major muscle groups and moved along..would mix in this tape with others for a change ..and still get a workout.
2,Not her best workout,"Now, I love me some Jillian Michaels. Plain and simple, because she kicks butt and it is effective! This DVD, not so much. The outside says two 45 minute workouts, but the first one was around 30 WITH warm up and cool down. I have done some of her other 20-30 minute workouts and felt like I was going to die before they finished! After just completeing this one, i am very disappointed. I don't really feel like i challenged myself at all today. I have at least five of her DVDs, but this is the first one that will be going back."
5,I love JM!,As always Jillian delivers! I have almost all her DVDs and this is a great addition to my workout rotation!
2,Meal Plan Included???,"I have one other Jillian DVD and this one sounds similar, but I bought it specifically for the ""included"" meal plan. What a joke! There is no free meal plan included, just a link to her website where you have to pay $4 a week for her program! So if you want a great workout, go ahead and get the DVD, but if you're tempted to get this DVD hoping to also get her meal plan as advertised on the cover, skip this one!"
5,EXCELLENT DVD,This workout was really great. I really like this workout and I think it's a great addition to Jillian.I have several DVDs and I like it all
5,Must Have!,"Awesome DVD, as usual Jillian delivers! The two part video is perfect if you are just starting out or are in a rush but want an effective work out."
5,Great Exercise Video!,I absolutely love this exercise video. Stream it from my computer while I'm watching news on TV. I also take it with me on my business trips. Do the video at night after long day of meetings! Love it. It is getting me shreaded! Thanks Jillian!
2,Also disappointed =(,"I agree with another reviewer (Gary Lian). This is my least favorite dvd of Jillian's (I love her style and most of her other videos). The style of moves are all over the place and they don't flow together in any way, shape or form.I thought I was getting 45 minute versions of workouts in the 30 Day Shred/Ripped in 30 style, wish I had read the reviews first.I gave it 2 stars because I did like some of the new moves, I just wish it was more congruent with the aforementioned videos."
2,Just OK,I'm a big fan of Jillian.I love 30 day shred as well as Ripped in 30 but I was very disappoited with this video. The moves are difficult and she doesn't go over the correct form like she does in 30 day or ripped.
5,This cd will be #1 in us at sometime,"I heard this album in thailand. I was in a disco with 3000 other people and it seemed like everyone was singing along. It is hard to describe accurately (sort of boy band meets hip hop meets disco?)I have played this for several people and everyone loved it and wanted to know where they could buy it. That included people in their teens, 20's, 30s, 40, and 50s. I haven't found one person that didn't like it. When US stations finally start playing these songs several of these will make it to the top 5.some people like one love, others the cover of Elton John, and so on. There is a good reason this album went to #1 in the UK. And it will in the states as well.I just wish I could buy stock in this group."
5,Kindergarden,"A holiday tale which will haunt your idle moments long past Christmas.Questions raised in one's mind which possibly are unanswerable.Tearful, yet not entirely without hope."
4,"Great product, but could be better for non-MIDI users","This is a great product from what I have seen so far. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that I can't listen to the computer play since I don't have a MIDI keyboard attached to my PC. I am actually using a piano to learn. I have corresponded with tech support, and while they have been prompt, they haven't been able to fix my problem."
3,"Good education, bad programming","I'm not entirely sure I would recommend this program.On one side, it is a fairly good piano education program with traditional piano lessons for a low price.On the other side, the program has lots of bugs, and minor problems. You can probably end up having even more problems than me. I'm not sure if Voyetra would give you your money back if it doesn't work properly, but they probably should, as there certainly is a risk of just that. Then again, it doesn't cost too much, so you might want to take the risk anyway."
2,Its not what I expect,"Poor quality of sound, and image and teaching. It is not fun and I don`t use it. I feel bad because I spend my money on this software, don`t recommend it at least you don`t know nothing about music."
2,Copy protection schemes,"This software has software protection schemes requiring one to use a number inside the box to install the program onto the computer. If the box gets thrownaway, the program cannot be installed and the CD becomes useless. Voyetra requires an additional charge to obtain a new number. In addition, the CD has to be inserted into the computer each time when running the program. Overall a cumbersome process in the name of copy protection."
4,Well Written Program with One Fault,"I've had this program for a couple of months and use it almost daily. Its visual and verbal aides for learning to play are excellent.The only drawback is that the screen image size is locked and cannot be adjusted by the user. Normally you install this program on a laptop and set it directly behind the keyboard so that you can see the screen while practicing. This allows the use of the mouse while making the midi connection to your keyboard a short one. Since the screen only takes up perhaps a third of the screen, the music notes are not easy to see. You can see them, but they would be so much easier to read if you could have the screen fill your laptop monitor.Overall, worth purchasing, but could be better."
2,Learn Piano!,"I find it ""entertaining"" to hear my CD-ROM whirling along as the program is running! What an annoying way to run a program. If you buy this, make sure and buy it off of EBAY because it is not worth the 45 dollars I paid for it. The games are not interesting and they guy presenting the lessons is boring! It is like watching paint dry. What a joke. I try to go back to it, once in a while, and learn something, but so far, nothing substantial. Contribute $45 to lessons."
1,THEY SELL OLD INCOMPATIBLE COPIES - BEWARE,"If you buy this program, it may not run on the systems that it is purported too. They promote a new version of their product on their web site and then sell old versions through dealers that are incompatible. Then when you contact support about the problem they tell you that you should have bought it direct from them if you wanted a copy of the software that would run on the computers they claim it does."
2,Try this one...,"With all these bad reviews, I'd like to make a suggestion...Adventus Piano Suite Premier...Lots of songs, rock solid stability (run the patch from the website if you have any problems) and easy transition from one lesson to the next..."
2,Not for kids or someone without a musical background!,"This CD-ROM is cheaper than paying for a private teacher but has some problems.Pros:Cheaper that paying for a private teacher, which can be costly.Take lessons whenever you want.A lot included (although a good amount of it is filler).Cons:The lesson progression was too fast for my kids to keep-up. I was able to keep-up but took piano years ago.Slightly dated program.The material taught (songs) are very bland. I wish they would included more modern tunes.The games included are worthless.Conclusion: If you already have some piano experience, this program could be interesting. However, if you are learning from scratch or getting this for your kids, you might have some difficulty."
3,Three of my kids used this!,"All my children learned to play the piano using this software exclusively to learn piano. One ended up learning Moonlight Sonata well enough to wow the grandparents.Yes, there are bugs. Sometimes (rarely) there is NO correct note that makes the program happy you are performing correctly. Grading is inaccurate and inconsistent - who cares? Music is typically fun to learn and it does teach you piano basics - one of its chief goals.We've never had MIDI issues. We typically have used SoundBlaster sound cards with good luck. The music does come out of the keyboard though - fine with us.The biggest bugger we have is not being able to control the sound feedback when you play the music (honks with wrong note, and other aural hints with you did/didn't do well).All in all, I would get it again if we were starting up with a new learner!"
2,"lots of features, most of them are terrible.","Firstly, this software is NOT truly XP compatible. Yes, it does run on XP, but it is not native. My first install gave me a ""16-bit subsystem"" error. I haven't seen something like that in 6 years.The range of features in the software is great. Unfortunately, most of them are implemented poorly and look like a throwback to Windows 95. There is also some sluggish inconsistency that other software doesn't seem to have.Get your act together, Voyetra!"
1,This is useless without a volume number.,"There are 26 volumes of this title, without a volume number, you do not know what you are getting. The ""publisher"" of this book should really note this on the page. For copying a Google scan and selling it for 45 dollars, they can at least put that much effort into it."
5,Toy Review,I think this toy is awesome!!!She sometimes gets a bit confused about where you want her to go but overall she's fun to play with. She can really move her legs so that amazed me but basically it's because of metal attraction. Her talking is cute but at some times wierd.This pony is my second most favorite toy.
3,Not impressed,"This is a cute looking toy. It comes with a couple little pony items and if the child claps in front of the toy...it will walk. It wont walk to the child when they clap in front of it and my daughter found this frusrtating. She has used it twice and now its going to collect dust. She is 5, too old for this toy I think. It is a very cute toy, it does respond to clapping or loud sounds and then it kinda waddles around. it has a couple phrases that it says randomly. I think this is a better gift for a younger chils. Thanks for reading."
3,Not A Favorite,"My daughter had to have this for her birthday. She opened immediately and once the batteries went in the clapping and shaking of the rattle started. After the party it only got played with a couple of times. It ""walks"" around while you are making noise and then it stops. Got boring for her. The voice is clear, the toy is heavy (watch out for little ones picking it up). After it got put away I pulled it out just for fun and it does not go anymore! It has never been dropped and hardly played with and for it not to work anymore was highly disappointing. I tried new batteries and everything and it will not move. Overall not a good buy for my daughter."
3,Just Okay,"After the non-stop commercials about the My Little Pony that Walks...my daughter begged me for this for the Christmas in 2006. She has played with it maybe 5 times in two years. Its really not that great and doesn't move that well even on tile or a hard surface. She plays more with just the pony. The walker is heavy and takes up too much room on a shelf in my opinion. I can't wait til she gives the 'green light' to donate this toy! Cute concept, but my kiddo just doesn't care about it! It sits on the shelf next to the other hyped up product, The Mega Mask."
3,"Nice, but gets boring quickly","I got this for my 5.5 yo last year, because it's what she really, really wanted (I can't believe I paid that much for it!). As predicted, she liked it and played with it for a while - and put the pony in the walker a few times in the following year - but mostly the walker just occupied space. I finally gave away the walker last month, with no objections from her. Now, the pony she really likes, still plays with and sometimes she sleeps with it."
3,OK but a little disappointed,"My daugher bought this toy with her allowance. She is four. I think this is a good toy for that age, but the pony at the beginning turn around when it hit a wall or furniture, and it doesn't do it anymore. Also, we clap or shake the rattle and it doesn't turn in our direction. It has new batteries, so it is not that. My girl doesn't play with the walker anymore because it is not working right, but she loves the pony."
4,My Little Pony So Soft Pony Walking Sweet Steps,I got this for my granddaughters 5th birthday. And she loved it! Didn't have any trouble on low pile carpet.
1,"Piece of junk, they need to fix the problems BEFORE manufacturing!","We got this toy, and from the first day it never worked right. The voice on it is LOUD, but clear. It only works when it feels like it, the walker just kinda sits there and wiggles a little like its stuck, but the floor is clean and flat (laminate flooring) and it STILL wont move! The rattle and cup and brush never did anything for us. In the end, I ended up taking the batteries back out and putting them in another toy. Donated this one, hopefully the kid who gets it wont mind how crummy it is. Buy the baby pony with the little bottle, my daughter LOVED that one (although the voice on it is hard to understand) and its cheaper!"
4,Very useful & interesting book.,"It's said we only use 10% of our brain. I never really believed that. I figured scientists just haven't been able to figure how we use the rest so if they don't know then of course nothing's happening, it doesn't exist, it's not used,etc. Reading this book I think gives a clue to what goes on with the other 90%. You do have to be open-minded to consider the possiblities. My only issue with the book is it presents everything as if it's only used in a positive way when it seems clear to me that some of these techniques can be used (and has been no doubt) in a negative manner. I think the author should address that more."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,I bought this for my autistic drt. My husband is very tech savy and he cannot get it to work. We have the correct software on our competer. I agree with the above seller. Don't waste your time and money. Very disappointed!
1,disappointed,"I bought this because it was an upgrade to one we had years ago, but this one does not work with my windows system even though it says it will. Have not been able to use it. Any help woulod be great.Thanks"
4,Pure Evil,"Kaganovich was an utterly evil man without redeeming characterists. He was responsible for far more deaths than Hitler.He was selfish, cared only about his career. He purged the Ukraine, the railroads, heavy industry - sent millions to their death."
4,"quality of book was very good, timing on shipping, pricing","As for purchasing, this was perfect, good timing in mailing and quality of book. This is a research in the making for me on a history study and it is helping in my studies on the Bolsheviks and Russian- understanding of this time frame, the people and many differences in ""types of people called Jews"", as well, the Russian issues at the time before, and during the build-up of war and social and cultural changes. Seeing this world through the eyes of offspring of people of the past who significantly added to history is very interesting."
5,the wolf in the kremlin,"this was a used book and it was in the exact condition as described by the seller-the price was great for a hard to locate book-i would not hesitate to recommend ""woody's bookslarry"
1,Awful,I think Stuart Kahan should take a course in ethics...or has he re-thought his views of his darling uncle?
2,20 bucks for that small thing!?,"Well its not bad if you knew it was going to be that small, but i thought it would be an actual bow not something the size on my hand and the string isn't even string. But i would say it's good but just if you want something to hang on the wall i guess."
2,Completely Not What I EXPECTED FROM THE CD's Title!!,"OK, first of all I was lured into buying this cd by reading a review in BPM magazine and Mix-Mag Magazine!! Since, I am a faithful reader of both these awesome Techno/Trance/Dance Magazines, and I can always trust their opionons on new music and stuff, but this time I have beg to differ on cd review on this CD!! When you first play this CD one expects some really cool and exotic down-tempo kind of Jazzy lounge beats, but instead I got popy-bass lines that were totally of character for this kind of CD Title and music theme!! Please be smart and listen to more of the tracks on this CD on Amazon's music clips that they have before you buy this CD, because if you don't, you will be left with the feeling of getting screwed!! If your looking for a true down-tempo, Jazzy lounge sound, go with the Destination Lounge CD series or the Habitat Series!!!"
3,Hard to use,There is a lot of data; but there is no index. Be prepared to go through page after page of data in search for what you are looking for.
4,love it!,The WOW mouse pads are thin but meant to be for small spaces and where need a flat surface. It is where part of the keyboard is on it just a small amount. It depends on the desk you have but it works great for my purposes. Cute options as well. Easy to clean.
5,Best Muffin Book Ever!!!,I had this book for almost twenty years and my copy went missing. I was thrilled that I could go to Amazon and replace it. It's the only muffin book anyone will ever need.I have baked almost every muffin in this book and was never disappointed with any muffin!
1,They send me the wrong shoe.,I bought this shoe thinking it would be the Predator but when I got the box it was a different shoe inside. Not even a soccer shoe. I should have known there was something fishy with that price. 3 weeks later I have not got my money back yet. Amazon let me down this time.
4,Appreciate the North Pole Explorers,"I enjoyed this book. The author writes in a popular vein about the explorers in the late 1800's and early 1900's who tried to be the first to the North Pole. Well written. The reader really gets a sense of what it must have been like to be iced into the ice pack, be cold all the time, hunt polar bears, develop scurvy, etc. in the quest for the Pole. The author does a nice job writing about the various players and expeditions. At one point I was sufficiently moved to look up North Pole expeditions on the web with an eye towards gong there. I got over that, but I enjoyed the book till the end."
5,A good book of stories,The stories in this book are good. The addition of Wilson's cartoons is what elevates this book to great. A super read for short story fans who appreciate Wilson's twisted sense of humor.
4,GREAT PRODUCT AND VALUE,I HAVE USED THES FOR A WHILE FOR MY PATIENTS. IT IS A GREAT VALUE AND A SAFE WAY TO BUY FROM AMAZON
4,I really enjoyed reading this book,"I was looking for further reading on the time period of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, and I came across this book in my local library. It is very easy reading, and could be read by a 5th through Jr. HIgh student. It explains the time period of exploration from Spain and Portugal in terms of trade, commerce, and the desire to control the trade routes for the spice trade. It tells about all the major explorers of the time and their roles in this important part of history: da Gama, Magellan, Columbus, and more. I recommend reading it along with the book: ""The Other 1492"" the book about the Jewish people during the age of exploration. I read these books with my 12 year old. This book is about 200 pages long, but it is quick reading because of the large print and smaller pages."
2,typical deflecto,"looking at the picture ,i ordered not realizing they are a snap together /fold up flexible holder ,similar to a clam shell packaging that potato salad comes in at the market . tippy but works"
4,Loaded with plays,"A great book! Loaded with easy plays to run for all ages. Detailed plays for all scenario's as well (different zones, man to man, etc.) Provides diagrams of plays as well as a glossary of terms and symbols used in the book. Great for the beginner coach."
1,Ordered and Never Shipped,I ordered this and I never got it. I contacted the company(GooseIsland) and they never contacted me. I had to contact Amazon who was amazing and they credited my charge card back...Buyer BEWARE!
4,My daughter loves this!,"I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday. It's nice to get a big, fun toy with a relatively lower price tag. She loves the way she can make it ""grow"" with the magic wand and the noise it makes while ""growing."" It has enough space to play with lots of ponies at one time. If you add a Ponyville furniture set or two your little one may sit there for quite a while pretending to be in her own Ponyville world - mine does!"
3,Pony Castle is Great - But don't overpay!!!,I had to do a double take when I saw the price of this thing. 500 dollars. Are you kidding me!!! I bought this for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas 2 years ago and she still loves it. I paid 40 dollars for mine and was a little upset when I saw some the week after Christmas on clearance for 15. But my daughter loved it so I got over it. I wanted to get one for my 3-year old niece this year and I can't believe my eyes! My niece will be getting something else this year.
2,Not worth the money. Cheaply made.,"Dont waste your money on this. I have 2 daughters and have found that My Little Pony merchandise is very cheaply made, and falls apart, which frustrates the kids. ( amd parents). Ponys are cute...durable and always a hit, but the playsets suck. $109.00 ? they are out of their minds."
4,Loads of fun!,"Never having purchased a large toy like this for my 3 year old, I was hesitant on her reaction. She loved it! The toy is compact for easy storage as well as easy for my daughter to open and close. I would have liked to seen more products included with the castle. It was quite an expense to purchase the accessories needed to truly make the castle enjoyable. I'm happy to see that my daughter still enjoys her Christmas present and asks to play ""ponies"" everyday."
4,My Little Pony Crystal Rainbow Castle,"This toy is really cool. My 3 1/2 year old daughter got it from her Pap-pap for Christmas. The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars is that for the price,$59.95+tx, it should have TOTALLY come with a dinner table, like in the picture, or a free pony. I also wish you didn't have to push in the purple platforms on the top level before closing the thing up tight. If you try to close it with the purple platforms protruding, you could break the purple platforms. The wand idea to make it open up into a castle is an excellent concept. My daughter loves her castle. It is really really cute. Just wish it came with more for the price!"
3,not that great...,"My daughter was so excited to find this gift from santa under her tree, only to be deeply dissapointed in its quality. It is made of very flimy plastic. the ""magic"" growing feature is very noisy and hard to close. It does not come with much furniture and already one of the side doors will not close. She is still playing with it but afraid that she will break it. I am very dissapointed in this, especially considering the steep price tag."
2,"Crystal Rainbow Castle short of ""Magical""","The castle is cheaply made and comes with so few accesories worthy of mention and without the types of accessories that would make it something fun to play with. My daughter has hardly even played with hers, with the exception of opening and closing the castle just to hear the sound! She also noticed on her own that the apecial ""wand"" used to open the castle was not like the one in the adverstisement....""Mommy, there's no crystal on my wand, look!"" Also, the dance floor so weak it's nearly impossible for my 5 year old to even manuever. A definite disappointment for the $$"
1,TYPICAL ACTION FILM; 1.5 STARS,"AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING. THE ACTION IS NOT WORTH WATCHING, THE SCRIPT IS DUMB, AND THE STORY JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. ERNIE HUDSON'S ACTING TALENTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WASTED IN ANOTHER LOW-RENT DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FILM. IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''."
1,"Hey, what do you want anyway?","We have a competition to see who can find the worst movie. Then we watch it with a group of guys and call it ""Men's Stupid Movie Night."" This movie qualified, as do all of the movies by this director. It was pretty entertaining if viewed from that point of view. Bad dialogue, an incomprehensible plot, innappropriate and ultra cheesy sets, lousy ""acting"", stolen footage from other movies, no regard of military protocol, uniforms, weapons systems, and anything that resembles a real military situation. Since we invite our sons, we actually look for clean movies to mock, and this is full of gratuitous bad language, such as the scene where Ice T unloads a barrage of F-Bomb flak at the President of the United States. As Ice T states so succinctly, ""What a wasthte!"" (an attempt to spell Ice man's pronunciation). I could not agree more. But then again, that's what Stupid Movie Night is all about."
3,Not appropriate for sheathing or siding,"This tool drives staples about 3/16"" below the surface and lacks any depth of drive adjustment. As such, it is not appropriate for any application where staples need to be driven flush with the surface, such as applying sheathing or siding. I bought it to put on cedar shingles, and even at the lowest air pressure, it put the staples right through the shingle. If you are doing siding or sheathing, look for a stapler with an adjustment for depth of drive, such as the ones made by Dewalt or Senco. The tool seemed to be of decent build quality and was nicely packaged, but is useful only where sinking the staple below the surface is acceptable."
5,I couldn't put the book down,"A patient recently loaned this book to me, having visited St Augustine I was intrigued. I started the book at 12:00 pm and finished at 7:00pm that night. It is one of the greatest books I have read in recent time. I highly reccemmend it to others."
4,Read it Twice,I found this book quite interesting. I read it twice and couldn't put it down the first time. I visited St. Augustine and took photographs of Athalia's home and Alan Stanford's home. It was eerie to see the murder site so close to the 30 year anniversary. I think that the neighbor did it.
1,Interesting story needs interesting writers,"This murder case has all the ingredients for a spell-binding book, but BLOODY SUNSET is not it. Somebody should contact the author of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL and suggest that he visit St Augustine."
5,A book as full of gentle surprises as hunting for mountain lions,"Cats are very dear to me, having lived with house cats all my life and being fascinated by the great cats. So when I saw the subtitle of this book ""Mountain Lions, Zen Masters, and Wild Nature"" I just knew I had to read it. And I wasn't disappointed, not once. The whole book just sparkles with simple, direct writing that could be used as an exemplar of superb prose in any class. But I was especially struck by how many interesting twists and turns Mr. Thorp throws at us, even at the very end, the last 4 paragraphs, which I won't give away. I am sure I will reread this book several times!"
5,2nd time around,"This is the 2nd Rubbermaid large shed I have. I still have the other one, but since I live in Florida and we have hurricanes, I bought this shed to store my generator. These sheds are very easy to assemble if you read the directions and ""slide"" the floor in, instead of trying to snap the floor into place. It is also most helpful to have another persons available to assist you during assembly. Since I wanted the shed to store a particular item, it would have been helpful to me for the manufactor to list ""inside"" as well as outside measurments"". This particular shed is practical, durable, and with the two front doors and top that opens, is easy accessible."
1,Size Please,Would it be too much to ask to publish the cabinet dimensions in the description. I only have a specific space to work within.
4,quite amazing,"Recenty purchased this little guy for my apartment with some hesitation. Washed my first load of clothes yesterday in the machine and was quite impressed. Not too crazy about ringing by hand but the convenience is definitely worth it. Try it ....you will like. I also found if over-loaded, the water will leak from the holes on the bottom. I lightened up my loads and don't have any water leakage problems at all."
2,"Used to work great, but bit the dust after a year.","Initially I would have given this 4 stars, but it finally completely broke down after a year. Not a very durable product."
1,does not drain well,"It gets hand washable clothes cleaner than hand washing, but it does not spin out the water. About an inch of water sits in the bottom after it finishes draining and the clothes are VERY wet. I would not recommend this product. Costs more than it is worth and does not work as well as stated."
1,leaking problem,"The same as one of the other reviewers, both my first one and the second replacement had water leaking problem. For the first one, water came out during the rinsing cycle. For the second one, water leaked from the inlet: no water went to the tank. I was very frustrated about my experience and decided to return the unit. I also found the model was actually made in 2003. Guess the aging of tubing and other materials might cause the problem."
1,No spin dry is a killer,"This washer does not have spin dry capacity, which means your clothes are not washed (rinsed) as clean as the regular washers, and you will have to squeeze off the water by hand. Not worth the investment. I am returning mine..."
4,I am now rethinking many great books,"I read this book in a single sitting. It is a painful and moving book. When I finished I could not stop thinking about the ways families and professionals can fail people who are depressed. I also wanted to argue with the characters and the author because I was motivated to stop some of the most painful events.But then, this book took me somewhere else. I began to rethink some of the famous books concerning fictional women and their depressions or suicides. I especially am rethinking Anna Karenina and the reasons or causes of her suicide. I have never had any patience for Anna, I thought her selfish. Now I have much more compassion.This is not an easy book to read but I believe it will be a book you carry inside you as you read and even more as you move through the world as parent, friend, or family member."
5,Building a coalition? Read this book first,"In 2004 a group of 100+ nonprofit, business, and government entities in Rhode Island began collaborating on one goal: to get thousands of new affordable housing units publicly funded and built. It was a long shot at best. Yet, in 2006, the HousingWorks RI (HWRI) coalition could claim a major victory when voters overwhelmingly approved a $50 million bond for affordable housing. A post-game analysis of the HWRI success story discovered that, by accident or design, the coalition, in building itself, had followed every best practice set out in Mr. Chrislip's practical, balanced, authoritative Fieldbook. If you're attempting to move mountains using a civic coalition, skip the trial-and-error phase and read this book before you start."
4,Collaboration,"David Chrislip's book is a good repository of anecdotes of important collaborative examples in the US. It also contains a fair list of references and organizations related with civic action. As to collaboration leadership principles, remarks and theory it reflects the low penetration this subject still has in the academic world. And if you want to develop a collaborative civic project, do not think you will get much help reading this book"
