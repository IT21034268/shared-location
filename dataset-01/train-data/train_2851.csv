3,"Not exactly in the easy listening category,","but still, the music is laid back and smooth; it doesn't bother you or excite you, but you can enjoy this album while you do other calm activities. Like reading or writing, or just relaxing with music. William Joseph is good, the selections, not toooo exciting."
5,One of the best pianist that I have heard in a long time...,"I listen to William Joseph's ""Within"" c.d. in my car, home and business over and over again.I have seen him play in person, and his passionate emotion while he plays his piano, still sticks in my mind. He will someday be remembered as one of the top performers in the world!!"
1,Not what i thought,I started reading it and thought it was a different book. I never finished. Would not read it alone. Definitely for a partner or a group of people who are strong in their faith.
4,In good shape with reasonable shipping time,The book was a very good shape and shipped within a reasonable time. Good reseller!
5,Family fun for ages 5 to 95,My mother (72) introduced this game to me (52) and I taught my grandson (5) how to play. Easy to learn. Fun to play. I like the tin it comes in. The little gold centers are raised to make it easy to pick up the tiles.
4,Senior Stimulation,Some friends introduced us to the game and we have enjoyed playing it. Also like the fact that it easy to carry on a trip. Never the same design on the board!!!
5,Excellent!,"This game is a lot of fun!It's also great for practicing your number sense.I'd recommend it for everyone from middle school to old age.The quality of the game is great, too! I wish the directions were laminated however, it's not a big deal to do it yourself."
3,Triominos,"I have played this several times. Bought this time in the tin box thinking that I would have more pieces but this is not case, could only play with 3 people and that was pushing it. Recommend that get the box, and just duck tape it when gets beat up from wear and tear.Great gamePat Feb 5, 2012"
5,Great item,"Had the older style for over 15 years, this one is made heavy duty, and little center ball lets the tri's slide easier on surface. Tine is durable and holds up. Many friends love it and want to buy their own."
1,deluxe triominoes,"If it were complete it would have had a 5 star rating. Wanted to send this off to a family member, but this set does not come complete with the racks. the set we originally purchased a few years back had games pieces the same as these with four racks for the players to stack pieces as the game was played. this deluxe set comes without racks. very disappointed with that."
5,good stuff,"I recently saw this band at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. It was one of those deals where I had never heard of them but was near the stage when they started and figured I'd check them out, then move on. I never moved on. Powerful vocals and guitar backed by a solid rhythm section. You'll like it."
1,WAIST OF MONEY,"im not saying this gun is bad but for this kind of price you can get somthing MUCH beter. I would sugest the jg mp5a4 because to put it in a nutshell THIS IS NOT A PROFESIONAL GUN AND NOTHING MADE BY FIREPOWER IS. i have a c.m.o. ak47 that FAR overpowers hits harder has a higher rof is more acurate AND is fully upgradable, this gun simply doesent preform as well as most guns in this pricerange should."
2,Disappointing,"The closet doubler was easy to assemble. There were only two screws to attach which were contained in decorative silver balls. Unfortunately, the threads in one of them were flawed and the screw only screwed one turn. This was enough to hold a few garments but I wouldn't trust it with any weight. I probably should have returned it."
5,Philosophy of Care,"Seeing the Helping Hands Adult Day Care program, which is the fruit of the philosophy of this work, was a life changing event for me. The caring and love shown by the staff of Helping Hands are living testiment to the dedication of workers to improve the quality of life for clients affected by the devastation of Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. If all facilities, both assisted living and nursing homes, truly invested in this approach, life would indeed be different for the persons affected by this disease and their caregivers. A definite must for those struggling with the problems of caregiving those with Alzheimer's disease."
4,The Best Friends Approach to Alzheimer's Care,Simple yet profound new way of caring about people with Alzheimer's. Easy to read with practical use.
4,books,This is my third book purchasedfrom amazon and they all have beenvery good and in good condition.I will be making other purchase's.
2,Nothing New,"There are many books on the approach to Alzheimer's, of which this is one. Despite its attempt to present information for the care giver in an innovative format, there is little new here and compares unfavorably to what I consider the Gold Standard, The 36 Hour Day."
4,Bad Girl Good Advice,"If someone had asked me would I ever consider taking advice from a stripper I probably would have said ""no"". I found myself wondering what kind of experiences the author had prior to her gentleman's club exploits that helped to contribute to her clever interpretation of her topless bar clientele. My husband was as amused as I and passed the book along to a friend."
4,Excellent Read,"I was not even aware of this event until seeing it on the History Channel. When I saw this book at Amazon.com I ordered it. Very, very interesting book. Full of factual evidence but not too dry. It held my interest for the entire book."
4,Beatifully performed but not very exciting,"The reason why I ordered Abert's Ekkehard was that I was interested in Jonas Kaufmann' singing. The production was done about ten years ago, when he was in his early thirties. I enjoyed the beautiful lyric quality of his voice, which he is losing now in his transformation into a stronger and heavier tenor. I found Abert's music quite beautiful but flat without dramatic climax. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the CDs."
1,Extremely disappointed!,"Step by Step? Only if you know how to figure out things in between the spartan instructions and supposed step by step pictures! There isn't enough information for a beginner and nothing new to advance an intermediate. There's SOME good information on fabric types, supplies, etc. and color coordination, but even that is mainly limited to the contemporary ""shabby chic"" or ""French apartment"" look."
2,Not for a beginner...,"This book is beautiful and has good basic information, but after taking a beginner upholstery class, I realized that this book is a bit outdated. While it tells the reader to use a tack hammer and tacks, my teacher showed me how to use a staple gun! Much faster and easier to handle. Also, foam and dacron are much easier than horsehair and some of the materials listed in the book."
3,Over priced,Bought as gift on wish list. Personally I think the price was way too high.but in fairness it wasn't my list so I gave it 3 stars.
5,The Sabri Brothers at their best!,"Ghulam Farid and Maqbool Ahmed Sabri are among the greatest artists to ever live! The tracks are original recordings of famous songs with traditional instruments. A must for Sabri fans and all those who appreciate the transcendent quality of fine Qawwali music. ""Allah!"""
5,Great Product.. !!,I would recommend this product to people having veriocse veins problem as this is definitelty an ideal product with potent results with regular usage...There have been visible changes in the vericose veins and now there is less pain in the legs...Thanks Future Biotics...
1,Not as advertised,"Futurebiotics Veinfactors Varicose Vein Complex 90 Veggie Tabs (Purchased on 01/27/2008)by FuturebioticsOffered as ""Tabs"", I received ""Caps""."
5,Scenes of the orient,"This is a rich, glossy photobook of China. I bought the book because my family has ties to China. Wonderful pictures, a delight to the eye."
3,I`ve Seen better Photography,"This book would have been more aptly call ""A Day in China"".Many of the photos in this book look quite random to me.There are too many portaits of gawky chinamen smoking cigarettes.This does however capture many of the goings-on in the typical day of modern China(with portraits of monks,fisherman,factory workers,etc.There isn`t many awe inspiring landscapes and cityscapes in this book(although there are some)Over all I think this books documentary qualities outway its aesthetic qualities."
2,Each!,"Handlebars have two ends. If you want a mirror at each end, you want two of these. It is a well made part, but I wouldn't have payed so much if i realized it was for one."
3,Not the best Paolo,"If all you've heard of Paolo Conte is the American Nonsuch collection, this is not the best next step. There are relatively few Conte vocals, the quirkiness that was so appealing in the collection I found a bit much here. The influences here are less jazz and European music than 19th century American music. A similarity could be found to some of the quirkier Van Dyke Parks records, which also had a heavy Stephen Foster influence. The other vocalists sounded fine, but when you're expecting Paulo Conte, you want his voice on all the vocal cuts. Tournee 2 was much better for me."
4,The summa of a great work. La summa di un grande lavoro,"The summa of a great theatral work. The 4 languages songs solved any doubt of the skill of this artist. I've one, I want another"
4,May the Psyche Be With You,"I always enjoy reading other people's thoughts on the underlying themes of Star Wars. And this book takes a great Jungian approach to it. Several times the author points things out that make you think ""Hey, i never thought about it like that."" On the other hand, there were some parts where I felt the author was making an observation that was a litle out there. But then, I'm not a psychology student.The majority of the text in the book is relating the events of the movies. So even if you're not a hardcore fan like me, who's seen the movies a bazillion times, you'll be able to follow along as if you were watching the movies."
2,Not a Wahl barber comb,"This was sold as a ""Wahl barber comb"" but is a cheap knockoff. The cheap knockoff is thicker and does not have the same feel as a true Wahl barber comb. It looks like a Wahl barber comb, but it is not! I'd send it back, but it isn't worth my bother."
5,Fantastic !,"A dark horse. A true sleeper. This is some of the best World-Dub Mix you'll ever hear. No over-zealous pomp-avant garde pushing for the line but instead deeply sensual, complex and, most of all, imaginative music with a big heart beat. Owning a CD collection of several 1000 titles this is still what I put on if I want to put on something truly special."
2,Not as good as the series.,"I chose this video partly for nostalgia since I remembered enjoying Hetty Wainthropp. Unfortunately, this particular video was not up to the quality of the series. I looked at the first season and that was much better, more like I remembered."
1,appallingly poor,"The camera shipped without the driver CD (manufacturers' fault, not Amazon). I looked online--the manufacturer (micro innovations--they license the compaq name) does not even list this cam on their website, nor is the driver available elsewhere. I called the tech support number provided in the documentation and got a recording referring me to the website. Stay away--spend a bit more for a real cam manufactured by a real company."
2,Price now out-of-sight,"Just to add my protest to the others:I purchased 4 13oz jars from Amazon in October 2007 for $12.32 plus $7.23 in shipping.This same order in January 2008 (yes, I use a LOT of malted milk) was still $12.32 but shipping was $13.75In August 2008 (did I mention LOTS of malted milk?) the price had increased to $12.48 but shipping was only $3.90The current Amazon listing does not have the 4-pack, but does list the 6-pack for over $30 PLUS another $17+ for shipping.We all need to find another source or get Amazon to keep its merchants from gouging us on price."
5,"The best, but hard to find","I love this stuff! Really chocolatey and malty, much better than the bottled ""Whopper"" chocolate sauce/drink mix. For some reason, no retail stores around here seem to carry it (they only have the vanilla). What a relief to find it here - I no longer have to spend part of my vacations out East in grocery stores, stocking up so I can have it at home."
2,Nice; But What's With The Price?,I see somebody else griped about this pricing. Is there an error somewhere? I've ordered it from Groceries Express for $4.45 for the 13-ounce jar ($3.88 for the chocolate version). And I never thought of G-E as particularly cheap.
1,Didn't work,"The unit rattled right out of the package, not a good sign so it was no big surprise when it didn't work.We didn't realize it was defective until it was too late to return it. I feel that this was a random dud as we have another that is 5 years old."
2,Disappointment,"OK, I have used one of these for nearly two years and loved it. I just ordered another, and it wouldn't work - the computers (several) had problems recognizing the USB device, and once recognized, the pointer always had to be re-trained. Not the plug and play device I can hand to an average user. So I returned the unit and ordered another - same thing. Don't know what's happened, but I can no longer recommend this unit."
2,This book was not the best,"I have read other Eileen Goudge books and this was not her best work. The story was good but it read too much like a Danielle Steele novel It kept reitterating the same things over and over again...I had to struggle to finish it because I was like ""alright already, somebody do something!"" Oh well"
2,I think Goudge has written this one before.,"I purchased this book as light-hearted airplane fare. Yet even confined in a cabin at 10,000 feet, I couldn't stay interested in the story. Maybe it's because I think I already read this; it was called ""Such Devoted Sisters."" Or was it ""Garden of Lies?"" Fair, but nothing memorable."
3,Pretty Good,"I loved the story line, but it was too drawn-out. If it had of been written on half as many pages, I probably would have given it 5 stars. The story was great, and I don't want to say much so I don't mess it up for those who haven't read it yet. But I will say that there is one particular coincidence that I really liked. (Eileen is known for her coincidences, but I love that about her.) On a lighter note, I am glad the senator's widow found a new husband - she deserved it."
5,A special piece of history,"If you are a fan of history or not this is wonderful book. Having read a several other history books on WWII in college, this is the first book that has captured me. The journey the reader takes through the life of the author's family and through other soldier's personal experiences allows the reader to relate to the war rather then simply read about it. If history books in school were written like this one, history class would not have been dreaded."
5,Black Soldiers,"Book was very informative, bringing what I knew and adding volumes more.Well written and easy to understand."
1,This is a real stinker!,"This is a fascinating opera, but give this recording a wide berth or it will give you a very bad impression of the score. The old LP has Siepi and Domingo, along with Pablo Elvira -- all in terrific voice. Even Anna Moffo sounds good compared to the soprano here. Ms. Mazzola-Gavazzeni and the tenor, Marcus Haddock, manage to make some incredibly erotic music sound very matter of fact. Worst of all is the Archibaldo, Kurt Rydl, who barks and woofs his way through the part, only occasionally approximating the pitches or line and robbing the character of the dignity and power that Siepi brought so movingly.I bought this CD hoping to have an alternative to the Siepi/Domingo disc (not available on CD it seems). Unfortunately, this was a waste of $40.Kevin Hagen"
5,Hilarious and wonderfully written,"This is one of the best mysteries that I have read in a long time. Bell brings a wonderful touch of southern hospitality. The book will leave you in stitches. The only thing that I did not like was that the book gave away some vital things about the first book in the series, so don't read this on until you have read Biggie and the Poisoned Politician."
4,how not to or the ways?????????,You will find lots of information on the cycle of catching cold and also the ways that you can avoid it. The story of the book is somehow pushing you toward reading it as soon as you can and finish it up first fast. Emotions mixed with knowledg are the essential part of the book and you will love to read it.
4,A good choice for jazz fans,If you want to find the equivalent of Thelonius Monk's great piano work then this disc will be an eye opener. The Burmese musician's ability to fit foreign and indigenous instruments into these beautiful layered compositions is a real treat. This music is far more accesible to Western listeners than other musics of Southeast Asia and shouldn't be missed.
4,melody not harmony,"Many Westerners think of Southeast Asia as a simple ""blend"" of India and China (hence the word Indochina!). This CD proves that this is not quite true musically for Burma. Burmese music is rather unique in style and instrumentation, although there are a number of common elements with other southeast asian countries. It is perhaps not exactly easy listening, because unlike european music, harmony is almost absent in burmese music and ornamentation of the melodic line is the key ingredient to create an impressionistic mode (or mood). The piano sounds like a cross between Debussy and certain types of jazz. I particularly liked the last song ""Mya Man Giri"", which I think is a variation of a very old burmese melody."
5,Great accessory for routers in distant rooms.,"This antenna works great with my Linksys WRT54GC router. My router is in a bedroom in the back of my apartment, but I get a great signal from my living room thanks to the antenna; whereas, before I had the antenna, I barely had any signal at all in my living room. It works quite well with my Dell XPS 1640 laptop which contains an Intel WiFi Link 5300 802.11AGN Half Mini Card."
1,Linksys Antenna,"I find this unit to be of no advantage what ever. The signal has not improved, a waste of money."
4,Double the range of my wireless router,"I've screwed this device on to my compact Linksys router, a WRT54GC model. The antenna is huge, about 11"" tall, and it dwarfs the little compact router. But its effectively doubled the range of the router, and I now get a good signal in the kitchen 2 rooms away which I didn't before and I do get a weak signal enough to work with, in an upstairs bedroom at the other end of the house. So its been a worthwhile investment. Only thing is, it should have been priced at around $30 or less; the current price isn't exactly fair."
1,Antenna is worse than the standard antenna,"Although this is a Linksys-branded antenna that is certainly much longer than the antenna that comes with Linksys routers, this add-on actually made my in-home signal worse! It is either defective, or this whole product line is simply not worth the money."
1,Bait and Switch,"The antenna we ordered was listed as a name brand (Linksys). We received a generic antenna that does not work better than the small antenna that came with our Linksys router. In my opinion, this was pure bait and switch. Linksys should take this vendor to court for offering to sell their equipment and then substituting inferior no name product. Many who purchase will blame Linksys for the failure of the product. What a shame."
1,Poor substitute for genuine article,"This is NOT an HGA7S, OEM or otherwise. It's just someones wishful thinking about their cheap aftermarket antenna. It doesn't even have the range of the stubby antenna that come with Linksys devices."
4,Router signal improved,"At home I placed this HGA7S antenna on my Linksys Wireless-G Broadband WRTP54G router and now both wireless computers get excellent signal level, and a steady 54Mb transfer rate, on both floors of my home.I also installed a HGA7S antenna on my HP m8120 computer at church. With the supplied antenna from HP I got poor signal level, and a 2Mb transfer rate. After installing the Linksys High Gain Antenna for SMA Connectors on my HP m8120n computer, I get fair signal level and 24Mb transfer rate. That is pretty good for going 75 and feet through 5 walls."
1,What a piece of *rap!!!,this Router WRT54GC is absolute disaster of a product and so is this OVERPRICED antenna. none of it works beyond 10 feet or less wireless range......
3,Linksys High Gain Antenna for SMA Connectors HGA7S,"I'm sorry, but I am not in a position to know how effective it was. We had it sent to a messenger to carry to the Philippines where we had installed the router unit last montn.There will probably not be a feed back from them, the guest house fro a relegious order.Yours truly, Fred"
4,"Expensive, but it helped","I purchased a Linksys WRT54GC Compact Wireless-G Broadband Router for my in-laws place so I could have wireless access while visiting. My mother-in-law liked the little compact router because it was unobtrusive compared to the bigger routers. So, we bought it. After we installed it and got it working we found out the range on the little compact was router very limited (25 feet). To extend the range I purchased this High Gain Antenna. I attached it the router and it now has the range I need (50 feet). The down side of it is, now the router is very obtrusive with this tall ugly stick coming out of the top it and the cost of the two items purchased separately was a lot more than if I had just purchased a non-compact router."
3,Good improvement but costly,Easy to connect and setup and an increase in 7dB is a substantial increase in RF propagation. No necessarily worth the full price cost at local retailers but good way to save on cost of improving your wireless network. Best route is a repeater if cost is not an issue.
4,Fixed my problems,I'm over 300' from my house to my shop and with the stock antenna I could only connect part of the time and then at 37 to 45 percent signal strength. And this is after installing the twin 7dbi antennas on my WRT54GS router. After adding just the 7bdi on my PCI card I am hooking up at 67% signal strength and haven't dropped the connection since.Overpriced but it did help a lot in my circumstance.
4,20% improvement,I am experiencing a 1 bar gain (20%) in signal strength and speed with the HGA7S antenna attached to a vertical standing Linksys WRT54GC.
4,works as described,"The antenna added enough range to access the wireless router from a floor above, when previously a signal was not available."
1,Didn't help a bit,I bought this to extend the range of my access point in my 1500 sq ft flat. I had my access point at the far end of the house from where I wanted to connect some of the time. This antenna made no difference. I ended up moving my access point to resolve the problem.
3,Rating for antenna,This product is just okay. I don't get any additional range with it then when I didn't have it. That is kind of disappointing.
5,Everyone Will Want To Turn On Your Tree!!!!!,"I promise you will not be disappointed with this purchase. I have had a silver snowflake style one for 3 years now and it is always the talk of all my holiday visitors. It's inexpensive and is rather magical - If you're even slightly interested in this product but are weary of it's capabilities and longevity, BUY IT!"
4,Best switch for x mas tree,"Good Switch so you don't have to crawl in the back to the tree, This one is only on/off where my old one was several level. Still a good deal and good sale."
5,Had it for 2 years now,"No hiccoughs, no issues, just plain works and works well. No more crawling under the tree to unplug the lights before bedtime!"
3,Didn't work for two years.,"I'm an electrician and no matter what I have tried the last two years it doesn't do anything. Not sure why but it doesn't turn on at all. **Update as soon as I posted this and tossed the switch to the other side of the room, my kid picks it up and tries it on a toy of his and it started working. Working fine on the tree now...lol????"
5,"Product works well, but don't overload it!","We have used this product for several years. It works quite well, but I'd recommend that if you are a new customer, that you pay attention to the maximum wattage for it. We now use 3 of them, splitting a large tree load and lighted garland in the den appropriately."
2,Disappointed,"Here's another best of or greatest hits... I was overjoyed when I had heard that Perry, Perkins, Morello and Frusciante were teaming up after the PFP split... but to only generate one track? Understood, a contract was signed, but they could have put some of Perry's DJ Peretz mixes on here or various live tracks or b-sides. We just had a greatest hits a year or so ago. Oh well, the trials and tribulations of fatherhood I suppose. We can only thank a great artist to give us the great sounds of a true Morrison like rock and roller of the 90's and with that.... Thank You Boy's..."
2,"oh goody, .........damn.","Excitement and then disappointment and a little resentment fo the musician that I feel is one of the most unique and creative of all time. I agree with the attitude of the rest of the reviews in respect to being sick of compilations and starving for new material. This guy has so much in him I really am surprised that he doesn't release more. He doesn't even have to tour and his albums would sell. I know its harsh but is he that lazy, or is he that junkied out? Considering the five minutes I took to scan through this CD, its not worth buying unless you don't have any of the other originals. Finally, he should do an album with some tasteful instrumentals (more horns and skilled guitar). Along the lines of the Been Caught Stealing version on Kettle Whistle."
3,nothing really new from perry,"I love everything Perry Farrell does and that's why I bought the cd, thinking it was all new songs. I was disappointed that it wasn't all new but at least it did have my favorite Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros songs. I would recommend it as a ""Jane's/ Porno for Pyros greatest hits"" cd, or to people who want a good mix cd."
3,i agree with seagle,"what's the deal. perry plays at clubs in miami and la, doing all kinds of world beat and performance funkiness, but he has become inaccessable to the public. do i have to turn into a riche intenational jet setter to see what the man of magic and invention is stirring up in the smoke and mirrors of time. for those that of you are starving, some crash worship and some master muscians of jajouka along with some brazilian samba should ease your cravings. maybe someday perry will come off planet inaccessable."
4,The Best of both worlds?,"Once I got over the realization this wasn't new material, I thought....cool. I mean, at the time this came out, who knew he would still release ""Song yet to be sung"", get back together with Jane's Addiction, and re-launch Lollapalooza? I should have known. As odd as it seemed to put the best of his two bands on one disc, it's actually not, considering that they are fairly similar. What's stranger is that there isn't just a ""Best of Jane's Addiction"". Of course, maybe that's what ""Kettle Whistle"" was supposed to be. Anyway, regardless of what it's not, it is roughly the best of Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyro's, and a few extra's. And when you get ""Stop"", ""Pets"", and ""Ripple"" on the same cd, can't complain too much about that."
3,Rev this.,"I couldn't even tell you how old this album is. How long have Jane's been broken up? This release has all the classic Addiction, from every album, pre-Ritual, and stand outs from Porno for Pyros. It also contains rarities from the two, including an original take on Led Zep and the Dead. I love Jane's Addiction, I think that perhaps it is ignorant on Perry's part to release this album without the Jane's or Porno name on it. It's arrogant, but that is who he is. They make uplifting and ""hard charging"" music together. I will always miss them as a band. This is a great testament to them, but also an indication of how egos can sometimes overcome brilliance."
5,Life during the Blitz,"Vere Hodgson was a social worker living in the Notting Hill Gate area of London during WWII. Her account of the Blitz, and life in London during the War is a fascinating account of the everyday lives of ordinary people. The diary is full of detail about the difficulties of travelling, the lack of food (particularly fruit and eggs, hence the title), the responsibilities of being a fire-watcher during air-raids, and the toll that the uncertainties of life took on the population. One of Vere's more endearing traits is her hero-worship of Churchill. At one point she recommends that a statue of gold be erected in thanks for his leadership during the War. Her circle of friends is wide, and includes her family in Birmingham (where she visits as often as she is able). The diary brings the experiences of Londoners in those uncertain times vividly to life. Highly recommended."
2,Malouma,"If you have any interest in Mauritanian music or good music for that matter, I would redirect you to either of Dimi Mint Abba's recordings. She is indescribably more potent than Malouma. This disc is basically a second rate western pop attempt from a music culture with much more to offer. The only particularly rewarding feature of this record is the quite amusing cover of Otis Redding's Fa Fa Fa (sad song) and the lyrics which were translated into Hassanija abd back into English in the liner notes. Reading Otis brought through calssaical Arabic might be worth the purchase price. Get Dimi Mint Abba her recordings are 5 star stunning"
3,not so easy,"Does the job but not as easy as the video makes its, still need a hand to get to all the tough bits."
1,Unreadable and oh so wordy.....very dull,"The author had, I think but I'm not really sure, some interesting thoughts about memory and perception of music . Unfortunately, ,it is impossible to glean anything coherent out of this incredibly wordy, repetitive, vague, soup of stream of consciousness self indulgence . There are lots of words but the author never arrives at a clear, coherent point , and never says anything clearly . The book is dull and muddled. It's no mystery that this book is available for 1 cent and only has three reviews. Don't even think about it."
3,more popagandistic than academic,Trotsky shared Dewey's utilitarianism. They only disagreedabout the existence of laws governing social evolution . I.e.Dewey supported piecemeal reforms while Trotsky thought he knew the laws of history. With greater knowledge of historical cookery came his willingness to break more eggs for the omlettes of posterity.
1,"A most false, non-factual pathetic writing attempt..disgust.","This man (Hank Harrison)is utterly sour in his attempt to write a decent biography/ruin his daughters life. Maybe the fact that Miss Love is much more successful and talented than he ever could have been is just too scary for him to handle. My deepest concern goes out to this man to move on, maybe write children's stories? Atleast then he could be taken seriously for writing fiction stories..."
5,lo mejor de lo mejor,"este album esta muy bueno, esta para que te pares a bailar. yo se los recomiendo mucho."
2,It's stupid every good sieries always makes this happen...,It's stupid Every good series goes down on this a new Animorph why can't it stay as the same old Animorphs I have every book so far and that's probably the most stupid Animorphs I hate it when another person becomes bew It's the wrost book ever. By the way does anyone know if K.A. applegate will make a book where he the new one dies please.
3,A new Animorph,"A kid named David found Prince Elfangor's blue box in the construction sight.They try to get it back as birds, but they fail. Then, David sells it online. It turns out the recipient is Visser 3. They save him, but his parents get infested by yeerks. Then, they make David the 6th Animorph, not counting Aximili-Esgarruth-Isthil (Ax).Then, the Yeerks try to infest the presedent. But they don't.Visser 3 aquires his DNA pattern. Then, as cockroaches, they hide under the presedints helecopter in the Visser's blade ship. Then, a hatch opens and they fall. I won't tell you what happens, because I don't know. it only has a To Be Continued. . ."
2,SORRY TO HAVE TO SAY THIS TO ALL WHO LIKED THE BOOK...,"OK, am I missing something? How can ANYONE give this book a 4.5? I thought some parts were cool, and funny, but the end TOTALLY STUNK! I DON'T EVEN remember what happened at the end"
4,Can't wait for the next one in the trilogy,"Give David a BREAK! I mean yes he's a sniviling, selfish coward, but you would be too if you lost your parents. He's now got no one and no where to go. He doesn't know anyone in the group, so he doesn't trust them and that's why he wants to be the best to fit in and not be the new guy anymore. Both of his parents are Controllers and the Animorphs are given him grief. Marco has his dad at least, Rachel has both her parents(although divorced), Cassie's family is fine, Jake's parents still have their mind's, and the only one's who could even have a say are Tobias and Ax. David needs a friend not supervisor's."
1,Very hard to understand,I've read a lot of seriesbooks in my life. This series is one of the worst. Very different and strange. I can't even finish the book because It's very boring. If you guys love this series go for it.
1,boring and unexiting,i got really exited at first about there being a new animorph but lately the books have gotten boring. i better like the old fashion animorph.
5,This book is awsome,I like this book because it introduces the new Animorph David. He's becoming a real pain. I just hope everyone will get this book. I just got #21 in the mail it should be awesome if it's anything like The Discovery.
3,Ummmm...it was a pretty good book,"This book was way too confusing for my taste. The helicopter and the Blade ship (I think didn't pay much attention) was boring and most confusing. And that phone call that you read so much about was to David's parents who got turned into controllers. But let me tell U one think I hate that guy David it is so non-Animorph. He's hot-headed, naive and so much more. I think that Marco likes Rachael and maybe she likes him. But about that David liking Rachael and her liking him back that is so untrue if anything she is disgusted by him. But this book was narrated by Marco so it was pretty funny. And one more thing there is definity something wrong with this David guy. Personally, I think he's gonna get killed at the end and if not he's not going to be here to stay!!!!!"
3,Not the best,"I have been reading animorphs for almost a year and a half. I really don't like this book. I don't think that the newer ones are exciting as the first ones. I also am getting sick of the fact that the animorphs always win. Don't you think it would be cool if they either get trapped in a morph or get turned into controllers? I know it sounds like I'm dissing animorphs and I hate them, but that's not true.Nothing really spectacular happens in this book. I think that they should have left david to become a controller. Also I think that there could have been a little more action."
5,A really cool cliffhanger,"This book is the most exciting of the Animorphs series because of the suspense it leaves since the last chapter's words are ""To Be Continued"". Hinting a cliffhanger. So you need the next two books to know how the story ends. I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!"
5,"Okay, now for some CORRECT INFO!","Okay. It seems that almost all of the other 11 reviews that were up when I posted this one are either wrong or misinformed. The new kid, David, finds the blue box in the contruction site where Elfangor landed. Marco sees him with it and realizes what it is. The Animorphs go to David's house to steal the box back and David walks in the room while they are in morph on his desk. Somehow or other, David witnesses his dad as a human-Controller and becomes a hunted kid. The Animorphs rescue him and offer him the power to morph. He wants to morph the eagle, but everyone else wants him to morph the merlin. We learn that DAVID IS A HUUUUGE JERK!!!!!! All in all, I think I'll REALLY LIKE this book! K.A.A. always writes wonderful sci-fi! ---courtesy of The Nothlit's Guide to Animorphs, but I can't put my URL here. Amazon won't like it."
1,Does not work,"Looks nice, feels nice. But does not work reliably. Anything less than 10 minutes it does not ring reliably, if at all. Does not ring very long either. I am returning mine. Look for Sunbeam Long Ring timer. Much much better."
5,Rand McNally Goode's World Atlas 21st Edition,"We're very pleased. Clear maps and easy access to the country one is seeking. We use it frequently - looking up places that family members are travelling to. Beautiful reference. Phyllis, Euclid, Ohio"
2,Not for the world traveler!,"If you need a decent map of Ireland, New Zealand or anyplace else this isn't the right atlas. Tiny maps require a magifying glass to look at with only the most major cities shown. This is more useful to scientists checking weather patterns. Was useless to me needing a decent map of the British Isles. One 8.5 x 11 inch page covering the main isle of Britain including Ireland and the other lesser isles. I had expected at least one full page for Ireland and was greatly disappointed."
5,3rd Party Report,"I haven't actually seen this book - it was a present for my daughter's boyfriend. I am in the UK, he is in the USA so I bought it through Amazon to have it delivered to him directly. I am pleased to say that he was thrilled with it. He's a bit of a techno-chap. Whilst visiting me, he spent a lot of time pouring through my geographical books and atlases, so it seemed an ideal gift. My daughter informs me that he has had his head between the covers almost non-stop and even takes it with him when they visit their local library since (he maintains) it is far better than anything it has to offer! Which I take to mean he's pretty chuffed with it. Given that he has extensive reading on the Earth Sciences, I can only interpret as a major endorsement for the book. (I'd also like to thank Amazon.com for making its purchase and delivery totally painless - what did we ever do without them?)"
5,very happy,"This is the textbook for my college geography course. I saved fifteen dollars over my college bookstore, their's was a softback amazon's is hardback, it will last longer, I'm happy."
3,At best average...,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this atlas. A review stated that this is used in classrooms... They should have said it is used in basic geography courses. The scale of the maps does not allow for detailed view of a country. Names of small towns and cities are missing, names of rivers are missing, for instance in the country of Chile. Let's just say my Rand McNally road map of the US is better than this... I won't be able to plan out a trip around Europe using this Atlas... In short, if you never have owned an atlas in your life and never have seen a true atlas, then this is a good beginner's atlas."
3,Good data but substandard maps,"I wanted an atlas that would help me place and better understand places I see in the news. Unfortunately, the maps in this atlas are not as detailed as I had hoped. On the other hand, there are a lot of data that help to make up for this. If you want good detailed maps, though, look elsewhere."
2,Is Goodes Good?,"Goode's atlas is lacking in cohesiveness. The maps often are bound so far into the page it is difficult to find a map item that is close to the inside edge of the page. A map of a country often does not have the same detail for a bordering country on the same page (example: I would expect to see the area surrounding Basel, SW on the maps of Germany or France). I would also have liked to see a single map devoted to an single country for most countries (a map of Spain and Portugal is common, but a map of Italy should show only Italy and portions of bordering countries)."
5,hardcover for the price of softcover,"bought this from amazon because the bookstore had used softcovers for more than what it costs here. This 21st edition is better than the old one my teacher uses. I corrected a few mistakes (esp. the new Yugoslavian countries under Europe). Even after the course completes, I can still keep this book in my bookshelf (looks great)."
5,#1 world atlas for a reason,Great book. I'm using it for my current geography class and the map scales and legends are easy to understand.
5,Goode's World Atlas,This Atlas is a great resource to have on hand for any age and any education level.
5,Powerful beyond description,"I can't find words to do justice to the explosive and gorgeous power of Leila Josefowicz' performance of the Mendelssohn. The energy, the force, the passion, the sustained perfection of this is beyond breathtaking. Leila has long been my favorite violinist but this performance outranks anything I've ever heard her do. The other two compositions were new to me and her playing was utterly dazzling. I want to listen to these over and over again till I know them as well as the Mendelssohn. I wish I could convey what this music accomplishes. It is raw yet polished; flawless yet seemingly spontaneous; lustrous, dark, and astonishingly fierce. There's an immense courage and boldness to Leila's playing that the technique always completely supports. It's overwhelming. The whole recording is priceless. I listened to it in a trance. You have to hear it for yourself to grasp this."
2,Disappointed,"this is not worth buying. My kids are pretty creative and I thought this would be a great idea for this years Valentines cards. First of all the cards are just index cards. REALLY. Just regular idex cards. I would have been happy with 4x6 cardstock. The decor was cute, but none were stickers. For the price I expected more than 10 valentines and some stickers. Don't waste your money. You would get a better deal if you bought cardstock and stickers separately."
1,Really didn't like the product,"It is way over priced for what you get. Just postcard with punch out hearts and a stick of glue. No cute words like ""Be my Valentine"". Really disappointed with the product."
2,Bad and not in a good way,The first movie wasn't fantastic but it had way more going for it then this one does. For one it's funny and even though it's bad the movie it's enjoyable to watch. This movie is probley the worst horror movie I've ever seen bad cgi you never see the snowman but maybe the last 30 minutes and then the acting is just humilating If I was an actress involved in this movie I'd be embarrassed to put it on paper. They were suppose to make a sequel to follow up this one and thank god they didn't. I've seen plenty of cult films that were semi bad but never this bad. Watch killer klownz from outerspace if u want a cult horror movie
2,disappointing to say the least,"i'm a big fan of chilled ibiza 1 & 2 and thought this would be along the same lines, but not so much. it was basically just a few good songs mixed in with a bunch of bland chill out songs and some cheesy remakes. i regret buying this and would not advise anyone else to buy it."
2,What the hell happened here?,"I've only bought a few CD's that I ever regret spending the money on, and this is definitely one of them. The makers of Angel Beach should have quit after disc 1, which is full of the generic chillout tracks everyone's heard already.Disc 2 is bland, with nothing really sticking out on it.But my main gripe is disc 3. What the hell happened with this one? It seems the makers of Angel Beach didn't wanna shell out recording royalties, so decided to fill up half the disk with half-assed cover versions of chillout staples. Are you a fan of the Verve's ""Bittersweet Symphony""? Moby's ""Porcelain""? Coldplay's ""Trouble"" *and* ""Don't Panic""? What about the Robert Miles classic ""Children""? These great songs have been completely slaughtered in these elevator/karaoke renditions. If you have to listen to this compilation, save your money and download it."
3,Good Basic Glossary,I found this book to be a good reference. Many of the terms used do not directly applied to the industry I am in. I think that if some of the definitions were expanded on it would add value.
2,Not for a novice,"Very hard to understand and use and made for a super tech. I am sure it is a good product, just not user friendly."
3,MacBook maybe... Powerbook not so,"Just to ring in on Apple laptop power problems with this product... It seems to be working for some new Macbook owners and not for Apple Powerbook owners (not a 1.5ghz 17"" anyway). The USB power must be limited on the Powerbook line as I traded up from another (brand) portable drive that would not mount either from lack of sufficient power. Both (maybe all) portable drives need an a/c cord in addition to the USB cable for use with the Powerbook.... bummer.I will say that WD and other portable HD makers need to make it more clear that these devised do not work for all laptop owners. They should list the products on their website that have been tested. Also, they should either include the additional a/c cord with the product or have them available for purchase along side the product in the store... and not for much $$. I've looked all around and I can only find the additional cable directly from WD and for $18 or so ($10 cost + $8 for shipping and handling)."
1,Does not work with a PowerBook unless you purchase the external power supply,"Overall the drive works great with any desktop CPU I have used it on, but I purchased it to use with my Powerbook laptop. After talking to Western Digital Tech Support they told me that it will not work with any PowerBook unless you use an external power supply. USB 2.0 specification limits bus power to 500mA. Some notebook manufacturers, including Apple, abide by this specification and provide 500mA to the hard drive. 500mA isn't enough current to get this hard drive operational. So you need the external power supply. Would have been nice if Western Digital had designed their drive to be USB 2.0 compliant."
3,Requires an external power supply for many laptops,"The allure of this device, for me at least, is that one can have (could have had) 80 gigs of extra storage in a compact device that you just plug in to the SB port. However, even with an operating system update, my Passport does not mount when I plug it in to my Mac G4. I looked at the website and they suggest buying an external power supply for it as with many laptop computers there is insufficient power at the SB port to run the drive.[...] The drive itself is very compact and looks to be robust."
4,Great with a few drawbacks.,"The WD Passport is a great hard drive. It is fairly small in comparison to other similar capacity HDs, and is powered by the USB cable. But the software on WD's website that helps back up a hard drive runs excrutiatingly slowly and needs a lot of improvement. It takes over 12 hours to back up 40GBs!!!!"
4,Good for multimedia files!,"Easy to use, fast and reliable. The only thing I hate about this product is the fact that I spend $132 and a couple of weeks later the price droped to $99."
2,I LOVED it until...,"I thought this was a wonderful device. I told all my friends about it. I backed up home and work pcs with it. Then after 5 weeks it crashed. Now all the data is gone. It will cost me $220 for a data recovery company to retrieve SOME of the data that was lost.Maybe I was just the unlucky one, but I won't trust one of these again."
5,dell inspiron 700m,"my lovely laptop and the WD 80 GB passport get along famously. i backed up all my files, including music and photos, much more quickly than i had imagined. it's small enough to tote around with my laptop."
1,crummy tape,As I have stated previously all chart pack tape sucks!!!! It only sticks to certain surfaces for short periods of time. I wound up gluing it to the surface.
2,Keeps Time - Just Not The Right Time,"This is a stunning looking watch and the sweeping second hand reminds one of a Rolex. However my watch gains over two minutes a day! Too bad because for the price and the looks it seems like a real bargain. For those punctuality-challenged folks this might the perfect solution. ""Sorry I'm early, it's my Russky watch!"""
1,dissatisfied with product,"Finally received my package,there was no packaging protecting it from damage. Of course, it arrived damaged and unusable. The deal is great, but if I can't use the product it really isn't worth having. Thank goodness, I had a gift card I used so I wasn't out any money! Will not return to this seller again."
3,USB Cables Plug and sometimes No play.,"Computer sometimes reports that the device connected through this cable it not working. Have used the cable(s) I bought infrequently. Overall, iI probably would not buy this product again. The price was listed as $ 1.18 each, so I orderd 10 cables. The actual total, after $29.80 (!) shipping cost for less than a pound of products that will all fit into an oversize envelope, was $41.60 or $4.16 each."
3,Seems to work,"I use this for hooking up lots of different devices from one end of my desk to the other where the printer is.I had some issues with a video camera, but not entirely sure that had to do with the cable or not.The extending end of mine is a little too easy to let go sometimes, but as I said, it seems to work good if you don't move devices around too much."
3,Word of caution,This cables works great however note that some deveices may not work with this extender cable. I bought this to work with my flip video camera but found out that it wouldn't charge properly using this cable. Fortunatley it works to transfer files.
5,My Kids Love These!,This is a wonderful product. I have been having the hardest time getting my kids to practice their math facts. This did the trick. They actually fight over who gets to use it first! Highly recommended!
5,a really good learning and practice tool,I like this product because it is portable! Easy to take in the car or do while waiting for the bus. The CDS are a fun twist.
5,Fun way to learn math facts.,I bought the math wrap-ups to help my students get faster at their facts. They love the wrap-ups. I love the reproducible sheet to record their times. It shows them how much they have improved.Marcy
1,I bought this product based on the reviews......and learned my lesson.,"I wasted my money. Let me save you from wasting yours. These plastic sticks are said to aid in learning math facts. However there is nothing educational about them. You thread a string from the first number, over the second number to the answer .Nothing leads you there. You then flip the stick over and if you have the facts correct no lines show. Great, but if you get the equation wrong there is no feedback that helps you learn the correct answer.Save your money. Make flash cards or use David Berg's nine lines."
4,"""MEAT ON THE BONES""","This is a thorough presentation of the Apostle Paul and in it this author puts lots of ""meat on the bones"" of what we have previously known about Paul and his theology. It is rich in its presentation and easily understandable even for those without previous seminary background. Heartily recommend it!"
4,Rush to buy L'Allegro,"This is music that makes you feel glad to be alive - is there any composer better at expressing joy than Handel? This piece is all about the multi-faceted joys to be experienced - of the hunt(CD1, 16), the carnival (CD1, 23), solitude (CD1, 8,9), the theatre (CD2, 2,9) and the beauty of the night (CD2, 24). It is also a wonderful, perhaps unsurpassed, evocation of pre-industrial England. The singing is almost always first rate and Robert King seems to have shaken off the slightly restrained demeanor of some of his earlier Handel recordings and perhaps as a consequence the King's Consort and Choir are inspired. If you are unconvinced listen to the gorgeous duet at the end of part 3, possibly the best Handel ever wrote, and the sheer verve of the tenor air and chorus, 'These delights if though canst give'."
4,Revenge for Firefox,"""Sea Leopard"" refers to a revolutionary cloaking device that makes submarines immune from detection. Certain that the Russians have already kidnapped Sea Leopard's inventor, and compromised its technology, the Royal Navy rushes a prototype to sea aboard the submarine ""Proteus"". The joke's on the Brits - Leopard's inventor is only in imminent danger of kidnap, and the Red Navy resorts to an outrageous course of piracy to grab a hold of Leopard's technology by grabbing the Proteus.""Sea Leopard"" tries your credibility sometimes, but it's otherwise perfect Craig Thomas - the Russians, the Arctic, thos fast paced, unsentimental prose. If you've never read Craig Thomas, this book may convert you."
4,GREAT FOR ROSES,"I purchased Serenade to control mold on my roses. Works great, just use as directed. The product is just as described and was shipped very promptly. A great product at a good price."
1,save your money!,"another waste of space on your dvd shelf!...whenever a dvd of MADONNA (whom i think is a complete genious)comes out with a crappy shot of her on the cover (and not endorsed by her or her publishing company)...and NO description of what's inside...is just another rip off person trying to benefit from her name. your money is better spent on her charity or any other charity for that matter...and any description saying it is worth buying it is only from the person (s) who actually marketed the dvd in the first place. people...don't be fooled by words like ""limited edition"" or ""collector's box"" unless endorsed by Live Nation or Warner Brothers or Sire."
1,Madonna: The DVD Collector's Box,This is not what I expected. It is a documentary and I expected a performance. Very dissapointed.
3,What About Content?,"In order for me to want to buy it, or choose not to, I want to know what's on it. Why doesn't Amazon always list what's on a DVD or CD? Please, if you've seen a DVD, or listened to a DVD, please include full content. All we have so far is ""Yes, buy it"", ""No, don't buy it!"". How is that helpful? The only reason I rated it, is because I had to. I don't know how good it is/isn't, or what's on the 2 DVD set."
1,Don't Think So,Just say no! That's all I'm saying. Another rip off of two useless DVD's. JUST SAY NO!
4,Old Families of Staten Island,"For many of us searching for leads on our early Staten Island ancestors, this is a great starting place. It lists the names of many of the early families along with some helpful bits of history."
3,"Pollini is great, but this CD is not","Flat and a bit sedated, rather than dreamy or evocative as I believe Pollini is trying to attempt, lacking the crystalline quirkiness of tone or sharp contrasts of color I identify with the music of Debussy. I don't know if it is the engineering, but the sonority is way too deep and bassy, allowing much of the music to drown in itself. This is refined playing, and I adore Pollini, his recordings of Chopin's Polonaises and Liszt's B flat sonata are personal favorites, but I'm just more in the Gieseking school of playing Debussy, where a colder, impersonal interpretation that concentrates on the possibilities of the piano's coloring allows the natural vagueness of the compositions to speak for itself. I don't know much about impressionism or how Debussy preferred his music to be played, but I like my Debussy with a little more fire and clarity."
5,A great book for Doulas!,"This book helped me help one of my doula clients recently, and I am so grateful Polly Perez wrote it! My client decided on an epidural and while she and her husband took a nap I decided to read through the Nurturing Touch at Birth.I had just purchased it the day before and was eager to learn from it. Well, I happened to read about the knee press and how to do it... Guess what? The mom woke up after a 45 minute snooze and had terrible back pain but was not allowed out of bed. So her husband and I did the knee press until the pain passed. Worked like a charm.Thanks for writing such a great book Polly Perez!Katrina MacLeodbirth doulaChester County, PA"
1,The book was awful,"I thought the book was a let down and so was the discovery channel's tv/movie episode. Does anyone know what Kathleen errr, Natasha Peernock is doing now? I wanted to see more up to date pictures of Tasha. Is Robert dead now? I wish we could have seen pics of Tasha and Claire when they were beaten and what Tasha looks like now.The tv show didn't give us any file footage of the court case while the book at least showed pics of robert being cuffed and gaged and banging his head on the table...lol!both the show and the book were bad but I give the book more credit than the show for telling us the REAL name of Tasha Peernock. The tv show said her name was Kathleen. So much for concealing her identity when the book gave us the actual truth.I want to see a real movie!! I want to see and know how Tasha is doing!!!"
2,"Poorly organized, poorly edited, poorly written.","The writing in this book is often hard to follow. When they try to break down concepts for you, their analogies are often illogical or simply not helpful. Also, the order of chapters makes very little sense to me (for instance waiting till chapter 7 to introduce User-Interfaces). As a beginning student of Java, i know there are better books out there. I would suggest shopping around for a text that is better thought out."
3,"Good Book, but full of typos and errors","This is a great book for a beginner Java programmer. Many of the concepts are clearly explained and are easy to understand.However, considering that this is the Second Edition of this book, one would think that they would have addressed the errors in the programs. It is as if no one bothered to compile these programs after they were written.For example, in Example 2.9 on pages 53 and 54, line 20 states:""JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(""The result is "" + result);""when it should be:""JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,""The result is "" + result);"""
5,The Best,"Carol Buck's book is worth its weight in gold. Easy read. Good illustrations. The CD-ROM gives you a good feeling for the time element involved for the CPC exam. The questions on the CD-ROM give you good practice also. Carol Buck's method of study is helpful too. Follow her directions. After completing Carol Buck's review guide, I felt ready and confident for the CPC exam.The only glitch was that I found a few mistakes in the review guide. Don't let that stop you from purchasing her book or any of her books."
2,"Tried, but very flat","Angarred daughter of the exiled Lord Challo Hassan travels to Pergodi, the king's city to discover the reason behind her father's death. Apparently a hunting accident, but she suspects assassination and also begins to fear for her own life.There's intrigue, politics, magic, etc. etc. A lot of etc. and not much in the way of characters. The author tries hard, but the poor things are not in any way sympathetic. Angarred is a particularly unattractive young woman for a heroine. She is supposed to be free spirited and interesting, but alas she is simply a selfish little pain. One could not feel much pity for one so self-obsessed. The way she so uncaringly left the estate and its servants took the prize and cemented her unattractive lack."
3,Less from Over,"I bought this book coz the front picture was from Kuniko Y. Craft and there is a comment from my fav author, Patricia Mc.Killip.Well, Lo and behold, I am dissapointed to find so many good materials gone to waste in this book. There was the heroine (which I like as atopic in a story), the handsome magician, the shapechanger, the giant, and the court. But all was mixed and composed into so and so story.There is no depth in it that makes me thinking afterward. I'm just glad I made it till the last page without ruining the book.I guess I should be more careful next time."
3,So-so.,"I almost gave up on this book a couple of times; but if you can stay with it, it does get a little better on into the story. It just wasn't very interesting in the beginning, and I didn't like the main characters (Angarred and Mathewar) all that much. Also, the author went to a lot of trouble building two other characters, only to have them kill each other in the end. I didn't GET that. I give it 3 stars because I will probably never read it again or even keep it. I am interested to see if other reviewers feel the same."
3,I think I've heard this band before.....,"These guys are great but I think the only thing Christian about them is their label and the occasional religious graphic. I don't believe they're as original as they claim to be either. TFU has an uncanny resemblance to the band Botch, actually I think they're a direct rip off. Honestly I don't think that's a bad thing either."
5,Easy to Use Gauge,"I was looking for an accurate, easy to use gauge that I could trust. After one use, I can say it is easy to use and easy to read. I was able to get a reading first time without air loss 3 out of 4 times. The reading is held so I can concentrate on getting a good connection without losing air [this is important with bicycle tires] then move it to read.The 60psi max. dial is very easy to read but a bit low for some bicycle tires and it might take a bit too much pressure out of the tire. The pressure release is a bit stiff so it did not discharge fully each time but I don't see that being a problem. It is easier to read than a pencil gauge.The gauge gives consistent readings very similar to other gauges I have; I so far assume it's accurate."
3,Sea Monkeys,i bought the sea monkeys on mars. I think they are fun to watch when they get bigger. ...buy the million bubble air pump it is a must to oxygenate their water. this should help keep them alive.
3,More fun as an adult. . .,"I remember my disappointment as a child when my sea monkeys failed to play volley ball or drive cars as depicted in the color ads. Now as an adult thought, they make a nice occassional distraction on my desk."
2,does not contain all materials,the monkeys all die off soon because this case did not come with the million bubble blower. it was not till later I found out you could just blow in the tank with a straw to provide air. all died quikly.
1,Only one survived,Help....Remenber with this a product we are hoping to be satisfied after following instructions.......Well I have only one sea monkey and I was expecting many more....but I don't think for whatever reason ...there will be any more......So I am not satisfied....What do I do....Thanks
4,Interesting at first,"You certainly need to read the instructions before jumping in with these. We got them in the hopes that my 4 year old would enjoy them instead of the fish he was asking for. They are interesting, but after a while you kind of get bored. We'll be doing a fish tank for his Easter present. The sea monkeys though are easy to raise, easy to keep, and they seem dedicated to continuing the species. =) Due to their size though, there is only so much watching them you can do before you want to wander off and do something else. Having one of the keychains or other more portable containers would help though I'm sure.The million bubbles thing is a must I think...really makes aerating the water much easier."
2,Can't believe the other reviews,"Has anyone who reviewed this actually done the puzzle? My son (almost 3) is excellent at doing puzzles and we have to make an effort to find puzzles that are challenging enough for him. This puzzle however, is an exercise in frustration. Two of the perimeter pieces do not lock into the adjoining pieces. You need to find the adjacent piece to make the three pieces fit together. When he tried to do this puzzle he went through every single piece trying to fit it only for me to realize that there is no piece that fits in, only one that you place next to it. I find this to be a major negative in a puzzle designed for children."
3,t rex puzzle,"this puzzle with its shape was very hard for a 4 year old. his papaw helped him and they glued it to a board for his room, and said they would never work it again. probably for a child about 7."
4,Good Puzzle,"I purchased this for my 3 year old nephew who is crazy about dinosaurs. It's a nice size puzzle. Not to hard and not to easy, just right for his age."
1,Sad,"It regrettable that a writer of Dr. Vandiver's stature lent his name to this poorly edited and apparently unproofed volume. ( One caption refers to the "" breach "" of a gun. ) Some interesting details but, essentially, below par."
2,Randomly stops ticking,"If you don't want to overcook whatever's in the oven, avoid this gadget. Mine likes to randomly stop at the 22 minute mark. I have to give it a nudge to get it going again, without knowing how long it's been sitting frozen in time. Also, you can't shut off the annoying bell once it's started to ring, you just have to wait for it to stop on its own- basically, the alarm clock from hell."
1,Please avoid this 'book.,"Like I said, avoid this book, at all costs! I've been doing stand-up for a few months now, with a fair degree of success, and I thought I'd get this book to brush up on some basics. What a mistake.It reads like a geometry textbook for Christ's sake!`Create subject (a): attach Subject (b); where (b) is an opposite of (d), but only when (x) is a variant. Let's not forget (y), which goes like this: ""Why did I waste money on this rotten book?"" `If you have money to spend, and want to be a stand-up, just buy some DVD's and learn by observing other comics, and not by wasting your time on a book that reads like a physics lecture."
5,So you think you're funny...,"Greg Dean's book is unique. Completely and absolutely. Other comedy self-help books tell you how you can be ""funny"" even if you're NOT already. Not much chance of that happening! No, Dean's book won't make you funny. BUT if you already have a good sense of humor, Greg Dean's techniques will make you funnier than you've ever been before. Dean's easy-to-understand teaching method makes this a must-have for the beginner and professional alike. There's stuff in here you won't see ANYWHERE ELSE!"
5,Great Way to Develop Material,"His step by step method of developing comedy out of virtually ANYthing is a great way to get the creative juices going. As a Stand-Up Comedian, I tried it out once and the one joke i developed from this method and it brought the hardcore laughs! The POVs allow you to give more dimensions to your stand-up act. Thanks Mr. Dean!"
2,Step by Step to Stand up,"This is a very heady book. If you are natural comedian with a gifted right brain who is looking for some refinement ideas, it might provide some good pointers, otherwise stay away from it and go to Zen and the art of Stand up by Jay Sankey."
5,"Exotic and powerful-great singers, beautiful instrumentals.","This album provides a range of different styles of Malian music, reflecting the different regions, and the degree of assimilation of Western music. I was suprised by the delicacy of much of the instrumentation; the vocals seemed harsh at first, but their beauty becomes self-evident after a few listenings. My favorite of the songs is ""Djugu Magni"", by Yayi Kanoute, which is very pop with a strong beat, but features an interlude of music reminiscent of Greece. I only wish this album provided a lyric sheet with translations! But I enjoyed the songs for the sound alone. By the way, the photos included are great."
5,Self-Working = No sleight of hand,"This book, along with all the other Fulves Self-Working series are full of really great magic that can be done without years of practice. That however, doesn't mean no practice. As with any presentation before an audience, attention to instructions and good audience management are essential. This means that, just like an actor in a play, the magician-to-be must know exactly what to do and when to do it, what to say and when to say it. This requires several run-throughs with no audience. (Sound like practice to me!!) I think that 'self-working' in the title means that you can do the effects without working on sleights for several months/years before you can do anything magical. This material can be presented after a few hours practice!"
2,Card book,"I got this because the other reviews said how good it was, but i opened it and gave up almost immediatly. The instructions are difficult to follow."
3,Not totally self working.,The tricks in this book are not totally self working. You have to remember a lot and tell people what to do.
5,Evocative story of pioneer Idaho,"This is a beautifully crafted story of a family that arrives in the US from Denmark and makes its way to Idaho, where they settle. The paintings used as illustrations accurately express the wild country that you can still find there, and the chapters, as episodes, are extremely well written."
4,Good classic,"This is a great book for history readers. I enjoyed this book as a young girl, so I had to buy it for when I have grandchildren. I had always hoped that there were more books like this. This is told from the aspect of 2 young girls that are on the Oregon Trail together and their adventures."
1,Not as advertised,The description of this CD lists 14 tracks but it only contains 3 tracks and is a sampler. Don't be deceived by AMAZON. Yellowcard is great - AMAZON got it wrong
1,deceived,"The music on this SINGLE is excellent. If you read carefully you'll notice that this is indeed a single, but I overlooked that since all of the tracks on the album were listed. Whoever made it look like that is a liar and has some repenting to do! Again, the music is excellent, so go ahead and pay the $3 plus shipping for the REAL version instead of $.92 plus shipping for this single. There actually is a cool thing about the single, though, it has an impressive live version of ""Lights and Sounds"" as the fourth and final track. Consider yourself fully informed."
3,"A Mix of Sensitive, Passionate, and Vulgar Playing...","Horowitz has always been a controversial figure in the music world, and this CD can help explain why. It abounds in obscene playing of Chopin (it's an almost painful experience to listen to the reading of the first Ballade) and contains some ridiculously eccentric Liszt (it sounds as if Horowitz plays the last two chords of the first Mephisto Waltz with his elbows). Apart from these shenanagins, however, Horowitz offers up several sparkling Scarlatti Sonatas, beautifully passionate Scriabin Etudes, and demonically exciting original transcriptions such as The Stars and Stripes Forever and the Carmen Variations. The two other Liszt selections are also very entertaining. My rating of three stars is based on the overall quality of playing on this particular album and not on my opinion of Horowitz in general. Still, this recording is worth the money for the few treats I have mentioned."
1,Not remotely Celtic,"This cd is misleading. The vocals and instrumentation don't even sound like they're trying to be Celtic. If you like synthetic praise and worship style songs, you may enjoy this cd. If you like Irish music or Celtic music and are looking for such,DON'T waste money on this one. My copy of this cd on the floor behind a bookshelf where it's been about a year. I listened to it once and threw it back there."
3,fell apart!,these earings are pretty but did not last long. A few weeks after I brought them the mother of pearl inlay fell off! These are not the best quality earings. I was not very happy with my purchase. :(
2,I didn't understand the hype...,"I couldn't understand the hype over this book. This was one of those books that gets good press and lands on a couple lists of best book of the year but for me, I thought it was rather simple. I think my biggest disconnect was my lack of knowledge of the Jewish culture. I honestly feel that if I was more aware of some of the family and cultural quirks, I would have enjoyed it much more."
1,another...ANOTHER...disfunctional family,"If you are NEW to the world of dysfunctional families, this may interest you.If Jewish dysfunctional families are what you LIVE with, move along without it.It was not enlightening or different. It was just more of the same."
2,Falls flat!,"Having read and enjoyed Kaaterskills Falls by Goodman, I eagerly looked forward to reading this. However, I found the book a let down. This story gave me the sense that Goodman had written parts of this as short stories and tried pasting them all together. There were two characters introduced midway through the book for several chapters who were then never heard from again. The first and second halves of the book don't seem to coherently fit together. I was left feeling like I got introduced to a bunch of different characters, but didn't really get to know any of them very well."
5,Atomic style clock that sets itself,Great clock from Seiko...an Atomic clock that sets itself and is always very accurate and beautiful. Don't ever have to worry that you have the wrong time and it automatically resets itself for time changes and time zones.
4,Detailed but Dry,"Educational Research is definetly a book for someone who is getting serious about research, but has not had much past experience. This book outlines many of the concepts and aspects that need to be involved in both qualitative and quantitative research. Most importantly, it gives good examples of each concept. The only downside to this book is that the subject matter tends to get a little dry at times. It can leave the reader wondering when the current chapter will end. However, this aspect is easily overlooked. For anyone who as ever wanted to know the intimate details about research, this is a book for you."
1,Should have read the reviews,He spends the whole book forcing her around every where and accusing her of being a slut and a gold digger. He bullies her into every situation and she screams for him to either let her out the car or to let her go but still ends up having sex with him. I feel like I spent $3 to read about very mentally abusive relationship from the inside. Just because they had sex doesn't make this any form of a romance to me.
2,NOT what i expected,not what i expected. i wasted my money buying the book.and the reviews did not help at all. the guy did not trust the lady from the beginning of the story to the end and he did not treat her well either. if you like a novel where the heroine has no self esteem at all then you can buy it
5,:0) ;0),LOVED IT great read for me regardless when she wrote it. I thought it might not have been good since it was written a while back. But i love it
4,Good Book,"I didn; expect to like this one, since I hate plots with secret babies who have aleady been born, it always feels like a lot of time was stolen from someone. But in this book I liked it. Plain and simple this is a short book thats main goal is to wrench some emotions out of the reader and it does that."
5,CRL Chrome Round Mirror Clip - Set,"I must have spent 3 hours searching different descrition combinations of what I thought those terrible clear plastic clips that hold mirrors on the wall are called to try to find an appealing alternative. I was rewarded by stumbling onto these. Sometimes its the small things that make you happy or small details that put the finishing touch on a project. I bought two sets. One to use immediately and one for future use. They work and better yet, look way better than the cheesy clear plastic holders. These are a two part fastener. There is a base piece that screws to the wall and has a notch to support and hold the mirror. The second is a cap that threads onto the base hiding the screw and providing a high end finished look. I recommend screwing into a stud or block behind sheetrock for larger mirrors. I do not trust plastic sheetrock anchors. Regards"
4,CRL Chrome Round Mirror clip,looked everywhere for something to replace the old plastic clips on bathroom. Rather than replace the whole mirror these help make the mirror basically look brand new. price seems high for what it is but i had a hard time finding something like this that doesnt require you to remove mirror and re hang. small price to pay compared to total replacement and or risk of breaking mirror when trying to re hang with other brackets.
4,Lots of Religious Psychology in a Small Book,"Copyrighted in 1981 with lots of footnotes from the 50's and 60's which may or may not be in existence today. Strandberg explores literature from different psychological angles with lots of references to powerful writers. He broke the sections into Religion of Heathy Minded-ness: Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, W. C. Williams, and Stevens; The Sick Soul: Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Stephen Crane, Dreiser, Robinson, Frost, and Nathanael West; Conversion: Poe, Eliot, Pound, Nabokov, Bellow, Ellison, and Rollo May; Mysticism: Steinbeck, Faulkner, Wolfe, Styron, Warren, McCullers, Updike, Hart Crane, and Darwin; and Saintliness: Emerson, William James, Melville, Henry James, Faulkner, Updike, and Bellows.It is a powerfully organized and extensively researched (or thought out) out-of-print book, which should be re-printed for its relevance."
3,Doesn't know ectoplasm from protoplasm...,"Ghost Busters [Region 2]taught us about the blue goo.It is called ectoplasm , not R. L. Stine's protoplasm.Ghost stories are good stuff for camp fires and little kids,but this one is kind of hokey.Not believing in ghosts is fine:we can't really ""measure"" them.But if you die and wake up as a ghost,that might be entirely different, ha, ha..."
5,Creepy!!!,This has to be one of the scareiest Goosebumps title ever. I congratulate you on another brilliant masterpeice Robert.
4,wierd camp with weird traditions and jokes that get serious.,"Harry and his brother,Alex who want to fit into a camp called Camp Spirit Moon.Tho the camp has alot of wierd traditions,a crazy salute,and a stupid greeting. Some of the old campers Love to pull practicle jokes on the new campers,but then the jokes started getting serios.A girl stuck her arm in a campfire,a boy jammed a pole throgh his foot,and during a walk with all the campers turned invisible and all you can see were their clothes. This book was O.K. I give it a B"
1,Distressing,"I found the whole thrust of the book most distressing. It seemed to teach parents to be harsh, authoritarian control freaks and not help them to attune themselves to their childrens needs and help satisfy them. Beware! Some damage done in early childhood often doesn't manifest itself till adulthood. Be sure to check out the qualifications of the author and the way scripture is used. It seems to me there is a hidden agenda and they are just trying to find scriptures to hang it on."
5,A Must Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This year's Star Trek Stardate: day to day calendar is a must buy. I has been five days of the year 2006, but the design of the page with the photos continues the great design from the year 2005 verison of the Star Trek: day to day calendar."
4,"Runny, so apply carefully","The bottle of Black Onyx I got was pretty runny, so you need to be careful when you put it on because it will seep into your nail bed really easily. However, even when I put it on sparingly, it only needed one coat, rarely two."
5,The Best Yet,"As usual, Sandi Patty is wonderful, she never disappoints me. She always has at least 1 or 2 songs that just grab my heart. This album is worth whatever amount you pay for it. The song ""Someday"" is worth the entire price. Sandi Patty doesn't just sing a song as many others do, she is the song and makes you a part of the song also. That isn't talent it's a gift that she has been given. She can bring tears to my eyes everytime I listen to her, beautiful, music from the heart."
1,Say NO to Yuletide Joy,"So disappointed in Sandi Patty's YULETIDE JOY. I admire her voice so much but, on this CD she mostly screeched. She might have been having fun but, I sure didn't enjoy it."
1,piece of crap,I doubt anyone uses these anymore but the unit and this attchement were just a waste of money.When the unit crapped out it took me months to get my data out since the company was no help at all.
1,"Good product, But Mine was also defective","Good add on, radio could have been built into Gmini as standard feature though. When i recieved my radio, it was also faulty, loose connection, static in right earphone, and loud clicking noise when cable was moved. Archos would not exchange it as I bought it off amazon's website (waiting to see if amazon will exchange it)!Had read reviews of Archos's bad build quality, but bought it any way, No problems with Gmini 400 so far (after 2 weeks!), but radio was broken when i took it out of the box and Archos refused to exchange it!Buyer beware!!"
1,I feel betrayed...,"About the remote control I can't complain... it looks great, the bad thing it that i couldn't use it! because it isn't compatible with my Archos Gmini XS 200 MP3 player!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't believe it! Amazon said that it IS COMPATIBLE, BUT DON'T TRUST THEM!"
5,Amazing Game!!!!!!!!!!!,"This games fun and just never get old, especially if you like the older game Yoshi's Story."
4,It is Fun~,"I am six and this is a great game. It is my first game for Nintendo DS, and it is easy enough for me to play but tricky enough to hold my attention for a long time. My mom likes the music."
5,Yoshi's back!,"I never thought Yoshi-the apple eating dinosaur would be the star of his very own video game.....But now he is! In the beginning of the game baby Mario and Luigi get kidnapped-only Mario escaping. Yoshi catches Mario on his back and the adventure begins! But, as you continue through the levels, try not to drop baby Mario. As you keep on beating levels, Yoshi turns into different colors, and you can unlock some other cool stuff, too."
3,Way too kiddish --,"I bought this game because I thought it would be like New Super Mario, which I really liked. This game is for really little kids. There is no challenge value, and the game is pretty boring. Don't get this if you are an adult player!"
1,This game is great but I'm stuck,"In the Six-Face Sal level, Yoshi keeps on losing his lives when those falling blocks are falling on him. He keeps dieing and I can't beat that level. I can't reach Six-Face Sal because of those stupid falling blocks. I need your HELP."
1,Why must all the good games be killed,"Nintendo really needs to put more effort into its games. It is unacceptable for the name of great games such as yoshi's island to be put to shame by crappy sequels. Furthermore, I have not found a single ds game to be satisfactory. Please stop making horrid games Nintendo."
3,grandkids,I got it so I could help my grandson with the game. Not an easy task. but with practice it will get better.
5,Best game on my DS,"I was a huge fan of the original Yoshi's island as well as the GBA version.I think this was one of my most anticipated titles on the DS. (i love yoshi)I love it , have played to land 4 now, and am very happy to see an update in playablility, by adding the other babies, peach, kong, wario.This is more of an update to the old game than a remake.The game does not use the novelty of the touchscreen at all, it does however, use both screens to show your new side scrolling and vertical world of wonder, with updated graphics and new creatures all around.A 'must have' DS title for any nintendo fan."
4,Decent,"I expected more from this game. I wanted more of the old school version not new. I know new features get added, but they went a little overboard. Some people enjoyed it though , it's just not for everyone."
5,FINALLY!,"After a decade since the last Yoshi game, Ninendo finally gives us original fans what we've been waiting for! I loved the original SNES game so much and still play it, and wasn't disappointed with this DS version. It's not a continuation of the original but a new adventure, with several different babies to choose from with different special abilities. Very fun, and very challenging! I'm sure I'll be playing it for a while.I was sad that it's a somewhat shorter game than the original, and I also was sad that while they kept some of the original music, there's not a whole lot of it (I really loved the SNES Yoshi's Island soundtrack). But the beautiful graphics are wonderful, really bring you into the game, and the action of the game is faster and smoother on the DS platform.Thanks Nintendo! I hope you bring us more Yoshi soon!"
3,Not as good as SMW2: Yoshi's Island,"Yoshi's Island for the SNES was a great game. This game is an ok game. What's different? Yoshi's Island DS is a difficult game. The SNES YI is easy to beat, but so fun that you will spend hours trying to get 100 on all the levels. YI DS will leave you either happy just barely getting through the level or just getting frustrated and turning the game off. What I miss most from the first game are the items. The items collected in mini-games made the mini-games worth playing. In YI DS the mini-games are harder, less enjoyable, and only get you coins and extra lives. Speaking of lives, you can get more than 100 in YI DS making getting extra lives pointless. Like many of nintendo's sequels lately (except the wonderful New SMB) it is an ok, playable game, but only if you've never played the original."
3,The boring and fun game put together.,"This game is alright i guess, it's just after you play at least a half hour of it, you just start feeling bored and you never want to play it again. But the levels are very hard and when they are hard, then that means it's more of a challenge. The levels are very fun but boring put together."
4,Good classic game,"This game is really fun for older and younger people alike. I had a good time playing it, and it can be played over and over again.Only one problem.The last levels are really DIFFICULT.I'm older, so I had the patience to keep trying the levels over and over again, but a child might get very frustrated. Just a warning.Over all, I would recommend the game, but don't get mad at the last levels!"
1,inferior to the classic yoshi's island game and most recent ports of the game,"this game is horrible and i agree with the reviewer ""coconut"". Nintendo didnt make/develope this game and it is obvious. This game is unforgiving and so challenging to a degree that it feels like beating this game is impossible to beat. This game is unbearable to play. If you want a good version of this game, buy the one for gameboy advance. If you do not own that system, this game can be downloaded via virtual console on the ds. Do not buy this ds version of this game"
4,Dog loves it,"Our dog loves his new bed(s). The only problem we have is when we wash it there is a lot of fill/kpok, whatever you call it in the dryer, yet we can't seem to find a hole in either one. Must be hiding some place."
3,a bit dissapointed,I bought this for my 50 lb. dog. She loves to curl up when she sleeps! She fits into this bed quite well and seems to really like it. I was hoping that it had a bit more padding so I have placed it on top of her cushioned bed. I plan to make a padded pillow insert.MultiPet MU90501 Yap Beds - Dolgi Super Soft Donut 30Inch
2,Cute but not well built,"Our puppy loved this bed, but the first time we had to wash it, it came apart in the washing machine on the gentle cycle. Not worth the price."
5,The Bes Plush Super Soft Cozy Bed,"We have purchased at least ten different dog beds for our three mini Dachshunds. This one is, hands down, their favorite! It is richly made, sparing no cost to materials. The others are cheaper, but made with flimsy materials. They don't hold up to washing well. This bed has been washed repeatedly and stands up to the test of time! Our doggies love the softness and plush feeling of the bed and they all like to curl up together in it."
4,Great bed,I have a Whippet who is about 30 pounds. This bed is the perfect size for him. It's shape allows him to curl up if he's cold yet flexible enough to let him stretch out. The sides are tall which makes him feel warm and snug yet not too tall where he can't lay over them if he wants to stretch out. The material is durable and soft. I agree with other reviewers that the bottom should be more padded but it doesn't detract from the overall positive aspects of the bed. I would highly recommend this bed.
5,Excellent Bed,"Right out of the box, this seems to be a very nice product. It is good quality and seems well made. The inside is very soft and plush. The cushion is removable (like the description states) - which will probably come in handy and is one of the reasons I bought this bed. It is everything I was expecting. It was packaged in plastic that squashed the bed slightly, however, I'm hoping the bed will fluff out with a little time and use.Edited on 25 Sept 2012 (after about 4 months of use): The bed has been a great one for my shih tzu. He loves it. I have a blanket in it and he curls right up in it for the night. The bed seems to have fluffed out with use and isn't lopsided anymore."
3,expensive paper map,"Pretty expensive for a plain paper map, I expected it to have some sort of lamination, but then.........It was exactly what I ordered other than that."
5,Glimmer,The way this game is made is to bring a glimmer when a childs reacts to it.There is anticipation thought the game!I found this to be best for autistic children but also can be used for all ages!
5,Charlie Chan Vol. 2,Marvelous 4 discs like originals I saw many years ago. No damage at ALL. All play like a dream. Great vendor and service. Cecy Ivie
4,Great B Movies,"I have loved Charlie Chan movies since they appeared on TV in the 60's. They have great atmosphere,and lighting. The indoor lighting is almost always waist level, giving a shadowy caste. The character actors are first rate and Warner Oland was the best, although there were certainly some ones with Sidney Toler. ""Castle in the Desert"" is certainly one. Recently a cable station would only show these movies preceded by a panel discussing the movies portrayal of asians. Certainly Charlie's accent was unnecessary since he was born in Hawaii. And an asian actor was never used. However Charlie was an extremely clever detective, perhaps a model detective and extremely respected throughout the world. And a great father. Watching these movies relaxes me and makes me nostalgic for the 30's although I didn't live then. It's too bad some of the early ones with Warner Oland were lost."
5,Excellent!,"I am a big fan of the Charlie Chan series. I have Volumes 1 2 and 3 and have watched all the films and special features. All of these Warner Oland films are the best in the series. I encourage you to watch them and see that they are not racist, and show that Charlie was a detective in the true sense of the word in the Warner Oland films. The Sidney Tolar films were more played for laughs as Monogram went this route to change up the character. Enjoy!"
1,misleading,"I wasn't aware this film was not associated with the members of Panic! at all until it showed up on my doorstep. I'm not happy AT ALL with it. I plan to talk to customer service to see if I can return it. If you are a huge fan of Panic!, like me, you could already find the information in the film because it has been publicized a bunch over tumblr and other places on the internet. It isn't interesting nor enticing. Save yourself the money and don't buy this!"
4,PATD:The Theatre of Imagination,"This is not a bad product. considering no members of Panic appear, and they cannot use their music. They do talk to the members of the Circus group that appears with Panic. Also music video director Shane, and Brent."
1,Waste of money!,"No Panic music at all in this DVD. If you're a Brent Wilson fan, you will love this. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,BASTA YA!,"THIS ALBUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED --BASTA YA! WHEN I HEARD OLGA WAS COMING OUT WITH A NEW CD ,I WAS EXPECTING NEW SONGS FROM THE MERENGUE DIVA,INSTEAD WAS VERY SURPRISED WITH THE ALBUM..I GUESS OLGA KNOWS THERE IS COMPETITION IN THE MERENGUE MUSIC..IF YOU WERE EXPECTING NEW MERENGUE SONGS ALSO,CHECK OUT THE NEW CD BY P.RICAN ARTIST--FLORANGEL""DEVUELVEME MI CORAZON""OR DANIELA DRUZ ""COSAS DE MUJERES"" OR MELINA LEON ""CON LOS PIES SOBRE LA TIERRA--I WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW OLGA'S MUSIC BUT LOVE HER TO MAKE NEW MERENGUE TUNES! INSTEAD I WILL SAY,GISSELLE VIVA GISSELLE! ESTO SI ES MERENGUE!"
2,Lackluster live cd from this talented singer,"I've been a fan of Olga Tanon since her days as member of Las Nenas de Ringo y Jossie and Chantelle and when I read about this cd, thought it would be a milestone in her career.However, the following factors made me give it only 2 stars:1)The recording was either made, mixed or mastered without taking into acount that this type of music needs to be equalized in a manner that not only her voice but also the bass, brass and percussion has ""punch"". It sounds as a live recording of a classical soloist.2) The new songs are filler.3) Her versions of salsa's classics previously recorded by Joe Cuba/Cheo Feliciano, El Gran Combo de PR, Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz and Willie Colon/Hector Lavoe are not outstanding.She deserves better albums. Let's hope the next studio recording brings the best in her."
4,NICE COLLECTION,"Nice cd. I like the collection. I like the live sound of it. Se lo recomiendo a todo! buenas pascas, y un prospero ano!"
3,depends on what you like!,"This is a beautifully crafted and performed cd. There are no vocals, and many long improvisational interludes and clarinet solos. It was a bit too New Agey for me. It has grown on me a bit listening to it, but still not one of my favorite cds. Good backround music for a quiet party."
5,Amazing!,"Lali Puna is my all time favorite band. I am just speechless and touched at how beautiful most of the songs are (my favorite Grin and Bear, Faking the books) you really should buy this album!"
5,Great music,"Lali has some amazing talent, I bought this cd years ago and I still enjoy listening to it. I love having it on in the background if I have people over and we're just relaxing and drinking, the cd for the most part is very mellow. I love mellow music to wind down to. Great, great, songs."
3,Accessibly edgy,"3 1/2With more streamlined, if still utterly listenable production, some of this refined electronic act's taut, melodically minimalistic burst-o'-beats feel a little less urgent then before, however a more positive approach helps compliment these still-impressive sound collages."
4,"Starts strong, weak finish","This album starts strongly with slow, melodic songs that remind me of the Notwist except with female vocals, but as the album nears the end, the songs drift styles to a more standard pop format, and my interest wanes. Overall, I'm still happy with my purchase."
4,Military point of view,The author has battlefield and military experience that is valuable to explain the what and how of Joan's military campaigns..The reasons for her military success on the battlefield is detailed with greater authority than Kelly Devries book Joan Of Arc A Military Leader..More precise and interesting..The book is a good read.
4,Durable Wok,We've had this wok for about 5 years now. It came without the utensil and tempura rack. My wife loves it. We use it probably every other month for stir fries and it cleans easily. The handle and helper handle make it easy to carry to the table (use oven mitts!). It is much heavier metal than our previous inexpensive wok and heats more evenly.
3,Roomy Wok,This is a good wok but the included utensils get hot so you need an oven mitt. Also it takes up alot of room if you have other pots to cook nearby. But a good buy nonetheless.
5,I have to comment due to Martin's ignorant comments,"First, it is a SD 1GB card if you know what that means.Go buy a piece of junk and youo will see the results and save $5.00.Simpletech make a SD card that is among the absolute fastest and tops in quality.Simpletech is made by Panasonic, check oout the price on the Panasonic end, which is the finest SD card made.If anyone looks at this top of the line SD card on PriceGrabber, of the seventten listings on it, AMAZON'S PRICE(INCLUDING SHIPPING), IS THE LOWEST PRICE.If you want garbage, slow speed, poor compatibility no support and something breakable, get a $90.00. Simpletech's SD is a Panasonic !!If not the best, then about the best price/performance SD card sold currently at Amazon."
3,Lipgloss,I haven't go this toy yet but really it dosen't teach kids anything and what makes this lipgloss better than others? Although it does have a cute case that comes with it and I fing that very cool! Overall I give it 3 stars :)
5,They always improve!,"This is Starflyer's greatest album, and they just get better everytime. This one is the greatest departure from the massive feedback and heavy guitars of silver and gold era. Now the songs are very melodic, each with its own distinction. Some have great deep, clanging bass, while others have strings and piano arrangements. The Party is one of my favorits, because it is just a swirl of melodic piano and strings, and is a perfect end to the album. No new kind of story is also great, with a bass line that makes you feel like you're flying somewhere, it's a great song to play while driving. I would describe the music as dreamy, with Jason's great low vocals that make you feel like you're half asleep-half awake, and sort of flying through the clouds. Very Very relaxing, this album can make you forget the problems of the day. Overall a masterpiece. Everyone should own this."
3,A classic book,"A BH Discography is a classic book, it was problably the first one to list all the BH records issued during her life. It is old, though, very poorly edited, horrible typography. But, as I said, a classic. I used it as one of the sources to my BH site: [...]"
2,Too fragmented,"I am just picking up bicycling, and I was looking for a good general introduction. This book was a tease. There is some good information in here. But it is simply a collection of columns from the magazine, not rewritten into book form. So it jumps around. Moreover, there is a lot of technical vocabulary right from the start, with no attempt to describe what all the words mean. It also is too focused on people who bike in groups. That's important, but many of us bike on our own.I'm still searching for the right bike book."
1,This is very poorly made. I do not recommend it,"I purchased this microscope as a gift for my grandson in another part of the country. When he got it he was extremely dissapointed. The focus mechanism did not work at all. A rubber wheel pushes the barrel of the microsope up and down. The barrel didn't move at all. It was so loose that even after putting 7 layers of transparent tape on the barrel it was still loose. There is a light, but the lens, which was glued in place, was cockeyed. It did not put any light whatsoever on the object being viewed. I do not recommend this microsope at any price."
3,Tumble fun on hard surfaces but not so much on carpet,"Cute but works best on hardwood not carpet. My son likes watching this toy and has fun with him.In order to make the tigger flip more, you clap and his will tumble more.Also what took us a while to figure out when we first got him (we bought him used) was to turn him on you have to push his nose in.If you play with him on carpet, tigger falls A LOT! He flips much easier on hard surfaces.He is fun but not recommended to play on carpet."
1,would have been great if it had worked........,"i ordered this toy for my nephew for christmas! i thought he would love watching tigger bounce and tumble. i had read online about the challenges with this toy and what to do with the tag in the battery case to make sure tigger moved properly. my brother in law and sister in law took the toy home and tigger would not work. infact, tigger smelled like he had been washed and them packaged. this toy was labeled on amazon as a ""new"" toy and I thought what i was purchasing was a ""new"" toy. i have to say that my nephew is very young and will never know the difference of how this toy works, but his uncle and myself will know. his uncle is overseas at this moment and wanted our nephew to have this specific toy. we are saddened that it did not work like we thought it would. this has been my first bad experience with amazon so i don't want to come off too harsh, but we are still disappointed with this product."
5,College Time Fun,I bought this for my roommate for her 21st birthday. We all get a laugh! Shipping was fast! Thanks!
3,Tumble Time Tigger is Okay,"We have twins and got the Tumble Time Tigger instead of the TMX Elmo. Which was a great idea. For some reason the babies aren't that interested in the Tumble Time Tigger. I think this is a very cute toy - but it is something to ""watch"" and is not hands on. So, if you have ""hands on"" child(ren) this may not be the toy you are looking for."
3,Cute Tumbler!,We bought this for my 18mo. niece and she really enjoyed it. My only issue was getting the toy out of its box! You need to unscrew it from the backside of the box - annoying when you have a little one ready to play with Tigger!
4,Not that bad..,"My son recieved this toy for his 2nd birthday and it works very good on our kitchen floor (as long as it's a floor with no carpet). Both of my sons enjoy tigger and have lots of fun with him. The only problem I have is that when tigger tumbles on his side, you have to make him stand in order to tumble again. Other than that, it tumbles great!!!!"
5,Awesome Toy,"This is an awesome toy. It works great, although it did take us a while to find the hidden tag, but once that was removed it worked great. It is so cute. Just be sure that you have removed the pull tag or else it does just fall over. I am definitly buying these for Christmas gifts."
1,Tumble Time Tigger TANKS,"My son was given this toy for Christmas, and it is one of the worst toys we own. Tigger rarely tumbles correctly, he mostly falls on his side and lays there. The song is cute, but overall the toy is very frustrating for my son. I would NOT purchase this toy!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY! MOST HORRIBLE TOY!,"I checked this toy out online at Fisher Price and thought it was GREAT. Well we purchased it for our son for Christmas and turns out this toy has never tumbled on his own and I didn't even know he was supposed to respond to your voice or sing a whole song until I read other reviews. Ours does nothing but fall over and says ""It's tumble time"". This was a huge waste of money! My son does not even touch it and I am very upset with Fisher Price because they have always made such GREAT toys until this one. If they had a bad batch of these then they should have recalled them or made a notice about it. Do not buy this because you could get a bad one and waste your money!"
1,MORE FALLS THAN TUMBLES,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! WEVE HAD THIS TOY FOR A WEEK NOW AND IT HAS YET TO MAKE A FULL TUMBLE! A WASTE OF $30!
2,cute.. but come on?,are you kidding? 180.00? no toy is worth that much money. especially at this age.
3,Not worth the MONEY!,"I give this a 3 because it did work for us. Unlike others, ours does tumble. However, it is a stupid toy. My kids were 3 and 1 1/2 when we got this and they got borded with it quickly. Plus they had a hard time setting it up to tumble, it would just fall over for them. Of course, I got it to tumble, and that is a pain when they can't play with it by themselves. It is not soft at all, so you can't do anything else with it. Needless to say, it sits on a shelf to collect dust."
2,It isnt worth it.,"I got this toy, thinking it was cute. When I brought it home. It got boring in a minute. After 2 minutes it started falling over and over and over, and soon its completely amazing to see him do it right.Please dont waste your money like i did. I swear, you will not be happy."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I've got to concur with the other reviewers. This simply doesn't work. Carpet, bare floor, tabletop, whatever surface it simply falls over and writhes on the floor.Don't waste your money on this."
5,Fisher-Price Tumble Time Tigger,this was a hit at Christmas. he is adorable and my 2 year old granddaughter loved him.. clap to make him go. he works best on a hard floor and not good for carpet. I was lucky to find him as he is not made any more. she also got the bounce tigger and loved it too.
2,"You will not receive the book you can see, above.","If you select the 'look inside!' option provided by Amazon, you will see a very professional book with a variety of illustrations. HOWEVER, what you actually receive when you purchase this book is an 'affordable paperback' which is, in fact, a bound printout with no illustrations. Or rather, wherever illustrations go, you will find [ILLUSTRATION]. It's pretty dodgy, frankly, and in many countries that sort of bait-and-switch is considered fraudulent.For my own part, I do intend to use the book - I bought it for the information contained within - but I'm certainly not impressed with Amazon right about now. If you want the product pictured above, I suggest you copy down the publication details and look elsewhere - Abebooks or Powell's will certainly be my port of call for future book purchases."
5,Opened my eyes again,"This music openned my eyes again. After hearing part of it on Public Radio while driving on the highway, I had to stop in an Indian music store in Chicago to get it."
5,A must read for data warehouse implementors.,"This new book by Ralph is culmination of his articles after his first book. This book is a must read for data warehouse implementors and for modelers who want to follow Dimensional Modeling. His template on the CD-ROM for the Project Plan, activities and responsibilites will surely help Project Managers of data warehouse to make thier project plan."
4,From a newbie ...,I just used this for a class and I thought it was a good book. I'm a data warehouse newbie and it was easy to understand and presented a lot of information that was very useful. I think it will be a good reference down the road.
5,The Data Warehouse Bible,"A great ""How To"" book. I personally implemented lot of techniques mentioned in this book. Though many of the star schema designs were same as it is found in ""The data warehouse toolkit"" .. the implementation ideas are simply great. A good book for both novice and professionals."
4,Very good introduction to data-warehouse modeling,"you will get a very good introduction to data-warehouse modeling, you will need some basic SQL-knowledge and a little bit patience during reading (the book could be a little bit shorter)"
5,Excellent,This item arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected. Thank you for your prompt shipment.
5,"Great Book, Fast shipping","I needed this book for a class. It was in perfect condition, is really easy to understand, and is not expensive at all. Great buy"
1,Left Without,"It has been a month and 5 days since I have ordered this book. I needed it for a college class and knew that I couldn't expect it for about three weeks. I still haven't received it, and I have emailed the seller to question whether or not he knew the whereabouts. I still haven't heard back from him and that was about a week ago. I don't know what to do at this point because the class is a month and a half in and I don't have money to pay for another book. I'm very disappointed and at the very least would like a refund."
4,X3 the reunion,"This makes up for what the original freelancer lacked. More cargo hold space, and building of stations and buying of fleets of ships. This game I bought a big lots for nothing. But it is mind boggling with all the stuff in this game. Buy your own factories, make your own automated trade routs. Buy upgrades new ship and make lots of money. In other words very good game."
2,Starts out fun but..,It crashes way to much to get into. My pc is fairly new and its specs are well past what the game needs. I posted about it on the game site and was told to get used to it and save alot. No thanks on this game.
1,Tech errors galore,"1. Six disk install.2. Wouldn't accept input from my Logitech gamepad3. Constantly aborted to Windows.4. Update didn't work.5. Update locked up PC, on reboot Chkdsk was needed.6. Uninstalled."
4,A Great Integration,Wayne has done a masterful job of presenting diverse and related fields. He brings an excellent melding of philosophies and leads the reader to an understanding of a very complex subject.Very Good Book for understanding medicine in the light of new science.
4,"Spanish for Medical Personnel, 6th ed. review","This text was used for a course at a community college in Texas. Having lived on the border (and Spanish being my 3rd language), I respectfully disagree with anyone who says this book/CD is ""worthless."" I took the course to be able to communicate better as both a licensed massage therapist and certified pharmacy technician. My teacher was super, and I look forward to another class with her. The twenty lessons, six appendices, and both Spanish-English and English-Spanish vocabulary lists, cover almost every medical situation one can imagine, from emergency room to diabetic dietary consult. Por favor,¡estudie más!"
3,Good but difficult material,"This is a good book, but the material is very difficult and I believe it would be hard to follow without the benefit of an instructor filling in the blanks between the equations. However, this is my first book (& class) in this area so I can't compare it to others."
5,Hello Kitty Journal,You just can't go wrong with this Hello Kitty Journal. Great Quality and always makes me smile :^D
3,A good Place to start but do not stop here.,"Now over ten years in print this major account of the world's religions is the best resource for authoritative information on the world's major religious traditions. Still the work remains especially uneven in the quality of articles. Eliade died soon after the work was in production and there was not as strong or even editorial control over the quality and depth of information presented. Some scholars did excellent contributions, others are rather slap-dash and the selection of article length and topics selected seem somewhat bewildering and idiosyncratic. The work did show something of the creative ferment in religious studies but it tended to avoid controversy or provide a systematic view of history or of religions. But even with these qualifications it is the only current Encyclopedia of religion though it is hoped that some of the Internet projects now in creation will eventually make up for its generally uneven executions. Good reading."
3,American Foreign,"Not the best book by any means, but this is what the course required so I had to get it. The seller was great, timely and accrutate in his description of the book."
2,Not for us,"Not for people who need a book on Laplace Transforms. Yes, lots of practice problems with answers. If you get lost and don't know how to go about a problem well page reference would have been nice."
5,"Wonderful reference, lotsa problems","I used this book (among others) for an undergraduate course on 'Fourier and Laplace Analysis' in my sophomore year in engineering. The author had presented the concepts of Fourier series and transforms before progressing to Laplace transforms. Many important topics like Convolution, Initial & Final Value Theorems as well as the applications of Laplace transforms in solving differential equations were presented in a clear-cut, understandable way.Using this book was a rewarding experience."
4,Laplace Transforms Explained in Plain English,This is a valuable reference to keep handy as a reminder about which transform methods best apply to various problems that you need to solve around the office.
5,The ascent of the Jewish soul,"To rise up to G-d to closer worship with G-d through full expression of the four levels of the soul. This work describes the ideal ascent of the Jewish soul .I remember being inspired by this book without having a sense of fully understanding. The book does have however a tone and spirit which is immistakable, and that is of a quest for greater holiness. It seems to me now I must read this book again in order to better understand it."
5,Great reference for divers,"After reading this book I am now confident I can tell the difference between canary, vermilion and yelloweye rockfish. As a pacific northwest diver I see a lot of these and other rockfish. My other fish books seem to have the same or similar single, small picture of each fish. This book has 6 or 8 pictures of each fish showing them in various stages of life which is very important for rockfish. This book also covers a lot of fish missing from my other books."
2,it's big...it's flashy...but it's disappointing,"A casual glance through this book might impress, but it's really stuffed full of ego-fodder, some really nice art, and some OK summary information about Pacific rockfish species. However, for those who have worked with Sebastes in the Pacific for 20+ years, it soon becomes obvious that much is lacking. Great gaps yawn throughout. The reference information is sorely lacking in completeness and much of the recent research over the past 10 years is missing. This could have been something great. It still is a nice starting place for those interested in the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus. But, after passing my new copy through the lab today, the concensus is that it is a pretty book lacking scientific integrity and completeness. Mary Yoklavich does add credibility by her involvement, but, well....for those who find joy in juvenile humor, you'll find some here. A scientific reference it's NOT. Sigh."
2,Very Disappointed !!!!,"Purchased several of these for gifts, both shipments have been a disappointment !! Each time I received items that where not as described in ad. There is no ""Domed Underwater City"", no ""Alien Light"" from the Flying Saucer cap (it looks like it could be equipped to handle if it was made that way), also there was no ""Telescope"" included. I contacted ""Uncle Milton"" concerning this and I was told that this item has not been sold by them for years, also that there were TWO models. The first one having NONE of the items included that I've mentioned above, and then a second model was issued with all the above items included. But both versions have been out of production for years.Amazon has been great though handling returns and refunds."
1,Not as described,"I ordered this for my 4 year old's birthday. He was so excited to see the spaceship glow and make the tank look like it was really in space. However, the spaceship does not really light up, nothing really glows, there is no telescope. He still thinks it is a cool design so we are keeping it. If I had spent more than $11 I would have been returning it."
5,Sluggy What?,"Funny name, funnier book. This is the second book in what is now (at least, at the time this review is being written) a 6 book series.Best read in a series, as some jokes will rely heavily on character background, or past events... although each book can be picked up and enjoyed without having read the entire series, it's still funnier if you know the whole story.Definitly worth a read... I've read my own set several times over already! It will cause you to start saying things like ""Ahhh! I'm burning with goodness!"" which, inevitably, causes people to give you funny looks as you laugh at your own joke.Once you read it, you're hooked. Don't forget to check out the website, for new daily comics!"
2,Did he copy Mike Fumento or what??,"Hm, shall we compare titles?""Fat Land : How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World"" versus ""The Fat of the Land: The Obesity Epidemic and How Overweight Americans Can Help Themselves""Of course the science in Crister's book is a bit more up to date than in Fumento's, but the message is the same...Americans eat too much sugar and fat, and calories in general. The only thing is, back in 1997 when the Fumento book was released, people didn't want to hear that. Now, in the aftermath of ""Fast Food Nation"" and the McDonald's lawsuit (more to come I'm sure), Crister (or his publishers) have decided the time is right for this book...Not nearly as interesting a read as Fumento's, I was only able to read ""Fat Land"" once - I'd recommend this as a library checkout book only...now ""Fat of the Land"" by Michael Fumento - THAT's a keeper!I must admit that way way back in the ""notes"" section, Crister does give an eensy weensy credit to the Fumento book..."
2,Just critiques government studies,"When I read Fast Food Nation, I thought I could expand my knowledge on why American waistlines are expanding. This small, expensive book provided little new knowledge on this subject.He goes into details that don't really shed much light on the subject. He spends a significant portion of the book describing the origins of High Fructose Corn Syrup. While interesting, the history is pretty much irrelevant now that it's already here. He spends another chunk of this book describing government studies and then criticizing them. Of course, does the American really base their decisions on the studies mentioned - I don't think so.The rest of his depiction of Fat America just concentrates on the supply side of calories. He really doesn't delve into the personal choices that affects one's eating.Basically, this book is small, but that's just means there is really no new information in there. Just read Fast Food Nation, and you'll get a lot more than this."
3,Interesting Topic but a Dry and Painful read!,I just finished this book. I was expecting a lot out of it and expected it to be more in line with Fast Food Nation. The book was a scathing critique of the fat culture we live in. I think that the author could have gone more in depth on certain topics such as caloric differences between meals cooked at home and meals out in restaurants. I would have also liked to see more personal stories in this book. That way we could follow individuals and really connect with a character in the book (sort of like the book The Working Poor). Overall I give this 3 stars for informative but not a very exciting read.
2,Condescending view--it's just not that easy!,"Losing weight is NOT as simple as Mr. Critser seems to believe, and his obvious disdain for the obese only takes away from his basic premise. Although he goes to great lengths to show scientific studies and historic references, the underlying attitude of ""obesity is the same as laziness and the culture is just promoting it"" is apparent in the language. Trust me, making someone feel bad about their weight is the worst way to make them get thin--or at least stay thin. How about, instead of trying to shame people back into thinness (an impossible task, as it turns out), we try to shame McDonald's and Krispy Kreme into being more concerned for their consumers' welfare? A better book on the subject would be Robert Pool's Fat: Fighting the Obesity Epidemic. It contains many more conversations with doctors and scientists as well as people who have gained or lost a large amount of weight, putting a much better spotlight on science versus personal disgust."
3,Explaining The American Need To Consume,"A closer look at the failing American diet and why we are encouraged to continue to consume. If you liked Supersize Me, you'll like this."
4,"No point in bickering over minutiae, America is too fat.","While it is indeed possible that some of the dietary recommendations in this book do not reflect the latest thinking, it is a plainly obvious to those who travel that Americans are fat and getting fatter. Bickering about the minutiae is pointless, those who have been following this topic for any time will know that the standard wisdom concerning nutrition is in a constant state of turmoil.While it is sometimes difficult to both avoid junk foods and exercise adequately, those that do so consistently feel better, look healthier, are more stress resistant and are over all happier. Any study purporting to show the opposite does so only via faulty experimental design."
5,"Finally, a sensible take on the subject--and a good read","Clearly, judging by the reviews here, this author has offended the Zone and Atkins diet types and the fat-is-beautiful types. But it's about time somebody told the truth. We're fat because we eat too much, and our culture pushes us to do so. That said, I wouldn't have read this book ordinarily. It was only the excellent New York Times review by Michael Pollan, whom I like, that made me read it. But I highly recommend it. It's a whopping good bunch of tales, well told and amusing. And you'll come out the other end thinking differently about things like that Big Gulp at the 7-11."
3,"A Wake-Call, Could Have Better","How Americans Became the Fattest People on Earth is the sub-title of Greg Critser's book Fat Land and the author's analysis of this particular issue of origins is the book's strength. The book becomes a little less focused on the issues of how to deal with this problem. The first few chapters are both fascinating and horrifying as it looks at the ways both government, through both action and inaction, and corporations, through truly aggressive action, have helped to create a country where the amount of calories being consumed keeps rising. The book is small and the coverage is slighter when it should be deeper on many of these initial inquiries. The issue of class is relevant and important but gets a little muddled in the final chapters although it is good that it is raised at all. This book is a wake-up call and will hopefully lead to stronger, sounder examinations of the problem."
3,Not as Good as the First,"City of Stars was difficult if not impossible to sink into while reading. It seems strained and forced, and is commonly on the confusing side. The many characters switching between lands and worlds are hard to keep up with. The first was very well-written, on the contrary. The sequel, however, was alright, but very confusing."
4,one of the best books i've read,"This book was recommended to me by Sensei Noone; who was one of Tabatas students.. And it goes without saying, its phenomenal. It's a combination of old and new wisdoms, ""five rings"" style and references but with a modern and current twist."
1,You've got to be kidding,"These are unbelievably huge. There will be no lingering doubt in anyone's mind that these might be anything but fake. Between the weight of the stone and the way the setting holds it way out from your ear, they droop, further adding to their ridiculous appearance. If your taste runs to gaudy/bling-bling or if you are looking for dual-duty jewelery that can also be used to flash a distress signal to a distant search and rescue plane, these are the earrings for you! Mine are getting sent back..."
3,marysu,"The product worked good for about 8 months, then it just stopped working i had to buy another one :("
1,Mac mini mismatch,"The experience began poorly with an installation CD that was unreadable and went down hill from there.I bought the product to use with my mac mini, but the usb plug was backwards, so the antenna could be used only if the computer hung over the edge of the desk. Tech support was often incomprehensible and consistently useless as they read unrelated questions off of their screen. e.g. ""What operating system are you using?"" Well, even I know enough to know that my usb ports don't switch themselves around when I upgrade my OS!Their solution was to have me send it back and get another one. Can't see how that's going to fix the problem. I won't deal with this company again."
5,Endlessly Fascinating,"Kathy Borrus, the author of the wonderful travel tome, ""The Fearless Shopper,"" has done it again. One Thousand Buildings of Paris is an endlessly fascinating romp through the architecture, history, and culture of Paris. A must for all adventurers, artists, architects, and academics, the book is both an art enthusiast's dream and a valuable reference for planning Parisian sightseeing. All in all, One Thousand Buildings of Paris is a one-of-a-kind photographic compendium and a true treat."
2,Did not do its job,"I used this soap on some plastic interior parts before applying SEM Color Coat. I cleaned the parts pretty well with regular soap and water first, then used this soap. As advertised it did highlight dirty spots, however it did not clean them! I kept scrubbing those spots until water did not bead on them, as instructed, but it did not help. The paint did not stick well to those same spots, and left a noticeably different texture after it dried.A thorough scrub with some mildly abrasive cleaner or even baking soda would have done a better job, and that is what I will be using next time."
3,Great Introduction to Mbira Music,"I've always loved Mbira music, and this CD is definitely worthwhile. You'll soon get swept up in the distinct sounds an mbira makes and will search for more."
1,Not the real stuff!,"Come on, this ain't authentic. Kwenda may use some African instruments, and a little little African inspiration, the rest is white commercial stuff, made for selling among whites. No music for me or an African searching back for his roots and true soul. This was wasted money. Boh."
5,Well worth it.,This is a must for true Beatles enthusiasts. Two classic albums for one price and priceless bonus tracks that can't be found anywhere else. The sound quality is great and the cover art is outstanding.
2,Deceptive Marketing,"This is actually not a bad CD. What really bugs me about this is the way it is marketed. This, like just about all of Nusrat's CDs, is full of magnificent qawwali music. This is sacred Pakistani sufi music. It is inspiring, and even mesmerizing. You would't have a CD of ""Top 10 Prayers"", so, having this sacred CD of religious music being marketed as a ""greatest hits"" CD is preposterous. This record company should be ashamed of themselves. Further, this CD isn't really a collection of ""famous Nusrat songs"". Yes the songs on here are good, but, basically, all the record company (Shanachie) did was license an old tape of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's from Pakistan, and called it ""Greatest Hits"" to fool American buyers.If you want one of his best traditional qawwali recordings, go for REAL WORLD'S CD, SHAHEN SHAH, or the Live Boxed Set on OCORA. If you want Nusrat's hits (he had some great pop-remixes done), then maybe MUSST MUSST is for you."
4,Vintage Nusrat,"Having acquired a taste for Nusrat's music only recently, I find that this album brings out his vintage best. Pure, almost surreal music. Hypnotic, lyrical and with gradient percussion. Of course, in large part the music is powerful because the lyrics are. The concept of ""yaar"" which is ever present in the Sufi music, is elevated to a divine, non-human level. In one lyric, ""yaar"" is almost above God, at least in the eyes of the devotee.But profound meaning aside, listeners will truly relish Nusrat's vocal scale, his ability to ""move"" you emotionally as he develops the theme of the song in perfect cadence with the pitch and tempo of his music.Introduction of raga-based melodies, adapted for Qwalli style singing is also an innovation not found with many Qwalls.Definitely a keeper."
4,I use it for workout DVD's and travel as well as for pleasure.,I like having the remote with this DVD player. I use it for workout DVD's so it is closer to me where I need it to be. I use it for meditation DVD's in a quiet place without other distractions. It's a great little machine with a big screen and a remote.
5,CLASSIC on Time Management,"This is THE classic on Time Management. There are many copies, but Hobbs is the orginal. His ""Insight"" system uses a ""Day Timer"" type of datebook, but can be adapted to other systems or computer based systems such as Outlook or ACT!."
5,Insight is a Slight Over-Sight,"To simply say that this program gives you insight, as it is called ""The Insight System for Planning Your Time and Your Life"" would be certainly a good explanation of this series although perhaps not sufficient. I have found great methods and philosophies within Charles Hobbs' approach to Time Management, which is ultimately Life Management.I hope you find in-sight into Insight System that is presented here. It's definitely worth taking not only a sight inside but also a good old fashioned listen. :) In short, it's worth the money so buy it if you'd like and use it... and don't stop using it."
4,Utterly charming!,"Louise Arnold's first book is a delightful, charming story. Her main characters are adorable, without ever resorting to cutesy-ness. Comparisons to Harry Potter are inevitable, given that Ms. Arnold previewed this story in an ""Are You The Next J.K Rowling?"" contest, but this story is completely original and stands firmly on its own two feet.And now I finally know where all those lost socks went!"
4,: ),"I really liked this book, although I'm holding back on reading it with my nieces because the school presented is just so bleak - bullies everywhere, everything broken, everything bad, nothing good at all. And our poor hero is the one who gets the worst of it.How you feel about this probably has a lot to do with how much your own school years sucked, but at any rate I think it's probably a bit better for somebody closer to 10 than to 7.Depressingly brutal school aside, the ghost world is well-written, the plot mostly hangs together (well... okay, the plot in this book is the weakest of the three out so far, but once you accept an invisible ghost world and a boy who can see it after being conked on the head, a crazy psychologist who wants to use ghosts to win the lottery isn't too impossible, is it?), and it's largely just fun. Even the school isn't too bad, since you know that Tom has a friend looking out for him."
3,tom's book review,"The book was pretty good but not the best I have ever read, I wouldn't put it on the top of book getting list. Now let me tell you a little bit about the story.Arthur is a ghost. He can never find a job that he can do because he is not good at anything. He can't find a job to his ability so he makes one up called an invisible friend.His invisible friend, Tom, always gets picked on by kids for no apparent reason. Arthur would spend his time taking notes off of his back. Then Tom gets hit by a car, and is knocked out for the night. But when he wakes up, something mysterious happens. Tom can see ghosts. He sees Arthur standing at the end of the bed. Now that's all I'm going to tell you because I don't want to spoil the good parts of the story for you. It was a good book but not the best.The book would attract readers who like fantasy, because it is about 2 worlds:the ghost world and the human world."
5,It's the best one,"If you want your dog to stop shedding, furminator deshedding brush is perfect for you. If you have a shedder dog you know how annoying is having hair all around your house. These won't stop it completely but will help a lot."
3,Not as good as the newer furminators,"I bought this after friends raved about the FURminator. I liked this one because it was priced so low. It works well, but I think the newer styles are much better."
4,Gets it done,"One cat LOVES it one cat hates it,but she hates everything. This brush/comb gets out so much hair I was amazed. I tried it on a wig to see if it was cutting. Nope, no cutting."
3,Ugh shed,The dog sheds a lot and this does help remove some of the shed but have not noticed a big difference in the reduction of shedding.
4,Great tool,I found this tool great on short haired breeds. Long haired just slightly better than a good dematting rake. The photographs are a bit exagerated about the results.
4,FURminator-Excellent Product,This is the best tool I have used so far for grooming my dogs between visits to the professional groomers. It gets most of the deep fur that the other tools never touch. I love it and so do my dogs. Lala of Woodlawn
5,"Furminator, large","This is truely a great product. It was previewed by Liz on Chanel 4 so I naturally went to Amazon to purchase it. So much less expensive than one of the pet stores. I have a very long haired samoyd, with very thick coat. I have to take her every 5 weeks to be groomed. This Furminator works great and removes lots and lots of hair that normally is on my carpets. Angel doesn't seem to mind it at all. Thanks Amazon for making this much more afordable."
1,Not worth it,"I have two large lab/husky/shepherd mixes that shed A LOT so they are brushed regularly. I thought this would help get things under control but I was wrong. No matter how long you brush them, the fur keeps coming. It seems this device is not gripping and pulling up undercoat and loose fur, but rather is slicing and shaving the fur. So in reality, if you keep going with the brushing, you will literally shave down to the skin. And unlike most other brushes, my dogs HATE this thing so I'm guessing it does not feel too good."
1,what a waste of money!,"Terrible product...I wanted to beleive that it was a really good one like we see on Tv..but once again....TV products usually = bad quality.Of course it doesn't work at all, and it's really uncomfortable to use!You have to be really careful if you dont want to hurt your pet while using this product!"
5,Unbelievable,"My dog got a demo of this in a store and it was amazing. I just gave her a bath after furminating her three times today and the difference was incredible. There was so much less hair to clean up after the bath. It is astonishing to see how much comes out after a single stroke of the brush and to see the aftermath of an entire session is amazing.She doesn't seem to mind the brushing (nor does the cat). This thing is amazing, but messy."
5,Great Cat Brush,"Awesome cat brush, got here in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend it to others!"
2,FUEminator,"This thing is amazing. If you have pets, you definitly need this product. Works wonders. You wouldn't believe the hair it pulls out!!"
4,furminator medium deshedding tool,"This deshedding tool works great. I got so tired using dog ""brushes"" and ""combs"" that just didn't work. I asked a friend who is a veterinarian what she would recommend and this is what she suggested. Try it - you''ll like it."
5,AMAZING,All I can say about this product is AMAZING. We have a black lab and he sheds so much I can't believe we still have a whole dog. I can't tell you the number of times I've found dog fur in the refrigerator and other places where fur just should not be. But this product has taken care of all of that. Again.....AMAZING!
3,It will pull the fur off.,"This will pull the fur off, no doubt. I'm not too sure how this solves the problem of shedding. As long as you brush, hair will come off. Used on a Chihuahua and jack Russell. May work better for cats, I don't know."
1,Not a genuine Furminator,"This is not a genuine Furminator, even though it is stated as such in the description. If you want the real thing, purchase somewhere else."
1,Please do not buy this from Amazon,"We purchased this from Amazon on December 14th from Bbcbuy.com. It took over a month to get the item. Once we did receive it, we realized this was a knock off - copy-cat item. It was shipped from China, and Made in china. It looks almost identical to the actual Furminator brand. With the obvious being it is not. The furminator brand is the best for this purpose. I would buy it from a pet store, it may be a few dollars more, yet you know exactly what you are getting.It is hard to trust amazon anymore to make sure you get what you really are wanting.Buy"
1,Wrong Product,The product that was received was not the product that was advertised and ordered. The product received had a smaller blade than advertised and was overall a huge disappointment.
4,Trying to defur my dog,I think this is a pretty effective tool however my dog needs at least 2 adults to hold her still - and nothing seems to stop her barking unless we put away the FURminator.
1,Do Not Buy--Cuts/Thins Healthy Fur,"I got my Furminator in fall/winter, and I feel so bad for my cats because it took out too much fur. Animals need a certain amount of undercoat in winter, don't they? I can't tell if it is more undercoat or more top coat that is gone, but it definitely looks like too much fur is gone. My kitty's fur looks too thin for winter now (fortunately, she's an indoor cat). Her fluffy tail lost so much fur that she looks sickly compared to how pretty she looked before we used the FURminator on her. This tool cuts or somehow removes too much fur and is more deception than effectiveness."
2,Furminator grooming brush,"This brush is very effective in removing dog hair. However, you MUST be very careful when using it to not cut or irritate the dog's skin. It also states this in the instructions for usage. I purchased it for my golden retriever and had to return it after just one use. She wound up with irritated skin and cuts in certain areas. If you are not a professional groomer you must be very careful when using it. At a hefty price of $40/$45 dollars a brush please consider this before using the brush. I returned it to amazon and was advised by my vetenarian to stop use immediately. Because certain dogs have sensitive skin, it should be considered prior to purchasing it."
2,Buy a slicker brush,"Honestly, a $9 slicker brush took more loose undercoat off my Shelties than the Furminator, with less effort and fuss. In addition, it merely brushed the fur out, rather than cutting it out. Save your money."
5,Neatest thing I have ever bought!!!!!!,This tool does just what they say it does!! It is Amazing!! The firt time I used it on my Border Collie I got 2 paper bags full! Do not hesitate to buy.
3,it helps!,"I have 2 cats, one longhair furball, and one shorthair who HATES to be brushed.The furball loves it. I've gotten a lot of hair out of her coat and it makes her feel very soft and silky. Even if I brush her one day and then again the day after, it amazes me how much hair still comes out!The shorthair still hates to be brushed, but it works pretty good on her too."
3,Not too good,"The FURminator is good for small breeds, for large breeds it takes a lot more time than with a regular brush."
1,Not all it is cracked up to be,"I have had siberian huskies all my life. If you are wanting to remove the thick undercoat on your dog, this brush is not for you. The ""bristles"" are very close together and short and seem to remove only the top layer of fur and not the undercoat. After one pass, you have to clear the short bristles of any removed hair in order to make the next pass. I say, stick with an undercoat rake. It is much more effective and much cheaper."
5,Works Awesome,My dog was shedding everywhere so we decided to get this tool and i was amazed at how much hair came out after only the first use. Definetly looking forward to having less hair on the carpet and furniture.
5,A tool that really works,"WOW! I have a drawer full of brushes, combs, etc., etc., that are supposed to remove dog hair, especially the shedding of the winter coat. I had read a couple of reviews on the Furminator, and decided to try it. We have two Corgis who have a shedding problem year round. My Furninator came in the mail yesterday and this morning my dogs look 10lbs thinner! I can't believe how well this tool works and my dogs loved being groomed with the Furninator. I'm a believer!"
5,Fur-Less,i have a white pit-bull who believe it or not sheds ALOT. we were washing our bed and couch cover atleast once a week(granted the couch cover is black). the first time i used the furminator there was enough fur on the ground to recreate a small dog! we were using this product ever day but have now cut back to ever other day. needless to say the shedding has be cut down tremendously! we love the furminator!
5,It works great!,The Furminator deshedding tool works great on our dog. We removed a lot of hair without any difficulty the first time we used it. It works as advertised. We love this product.
4,Furminator,"This is a good tool to help with shedding. We have 2 japanese chins, who shed quite a lot and this, if used regularly does help. You should use it regularly(at least twice per week) and you will be amazed at the amount of hair/fur it takes off your pet."
4,Works Great!!,"This tool really works! Saves time and energy. I can get out as much hair in 5 minutes as I could with a regular brush in an hour. My cat loves it. I took away one star because the blade doesn't last forever. For the price, I was hoping to have the tool for years. Not sure yet how long the blade is good for. The price on Amanzon is great. Costs much more in pet stores."
4,Very Pleased,"This item is definitely worth the money. I have used this on both my Siamese cat and my shar pei/shepherd mix dog. It does exactly as it says. however,I would not recommend this to be used on a dog that has excessive wrinkles or bumps because it is very aggressive at removing the undercoat. I learned to be very cautious on my dog even though his wrinkles are minimal. Overall a terrific product!"
4,Furminator,Works great. I didn't buy the shampoo but I think it works better if the pet or the brush is slightly wet. So using it after a walk in the rain has been successful.It took a while for our lab to get adjusted to the brush.
5,Furminator works great!,I love this product. I used it yesterday on my cat. I have a very fluffy cat and I got a lot of hair off. The hair just started flying off my cat. Use a towl because it gets everywhere. It works way better than the brush you would buy in the store.
4,good deal,"This works wells for our cats, esp the short haired one. He likes it very much. Arrived in due time."
5,"the fur flies, but only when you're ready","I've used off-brand slicker brushes on my lab mutt, with little-to-no effect on his shedding. The furminator, in short, removes so much of his undercoat that even after the first use his fur felt noticeably thinner. He's still shedding a lot, but a few day's use has already cut down how often I have to swiffer my hardwood floors. Make sure you have a trash can handy, this removes a lot more fur than you might expect the first time it's used."
5,good,"This is an amazing product!!! I highly recommend this product for anyone with a dog that sheds. I have a black lab and an american bulldog, who both shed, and since I starting using this - it has tremendously decreased."
5,great for bushy haired dogs,"Love this tool for pulling out the undercoat of your dog. It's works like the video I watched before purchasing, plus my neighbor let me try hers (she is pleased also with her purchase) before I bought mine. My dog just loves being brushed, so I think she would give it 5 stars too!"
5,Furminator deShedding Tool,If you have a yellow labrador you know the problem. The Furminator will cure the problem by removing all that loose hair and after 2 to 3 consecutive combing's you will wounder how you lived without this item. Best product of its' type for the dollar.
3,FURminator deShedding Tool with 2.6-inch edge,"The teeth aren't long enough, one of my dogs has thick fur. But it does a much better job than the other shedding comb I had."
4,Furminator,"Of course I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as reported. It does take out a good deal of hair, but none of my animals seem to enjoy it in any way. Also, even though I am disposing of massive quantities of hair, there still seems to be plenty for them to leave around the house. But I love them, and every little bit helps."
5,Don't believe the negative reviews,"This thing pulls hair from places so fast, the first pull will amaze you. Go ahead and get your slicker brush out and pull it across your pets fur 10 or 20 times, take that hair pile and set it to the side. Notice how long it takes you to get the hair out of the slicker brush.Now, using the furminator, pull it once or twice, you will get more hair out of it on the first and second times than from all of the pulls you use with the slicker brush.Just get one, you will not be sorry, and if you are, you are probably not easy to please anyways :-)"
5,The Furminator Works,"The medium brush works well to reduce shedding on our dogs and cats. It's wide enough to use on the dogs, yet not overwhelmingly large for the cats. All our pets enjoy the brushing, and it really does pull out a lot of loose underfur. The manufacturer recommends brushing outside, because the fur literally does fly. Just be careful not to use it on matted fur or sensitive body areas. The close tines would pull too hard, and the metal might irritate the skin."
3,It does remove a lot of hair!,"My dog has long hair and a lot of it. I tried the furminator and found that it does remove a lot of hair, but one has to be very careful when using it - just like the instructions mention. Because our dog has a lot of hair, it takes regular slow, controlled brushing ~ once per week to keep it under control. The brush is better used on the coat rather than the tail. I use a comb on his tail and hold on to the root section so that it doesn't cause pain. If only the furminator inventors could stop the static build up when brushing. That seems to really bother our dog."
3,FURminator Deshedding Tool,"Not too excited about this product. It seems to rip the hair off the animal. I used it on a dog and also on a cat. It seems to work okay, but it takes ""forever"" to take off enough hair to make a significant difference. It is a long and tedious process, and I have never finished deshedding any animal because of this. If you have patience, it may be a good product for you."
3,Just another dog brush,I reluctantly paid way more for this than I should of in hopes of eliminating the major shedding done by my short haired dachshund.All this is is a dog brush. I don't understand how it's gotten such great reviews. It's no more/less than any other dog brush I've used in the past.
5,Best Tool Ever,"The FURminator deShedding tool is absolutely the best on the market. I have a 10 year old Husky and have tried nearly everything to keep the shedding under control. I was simply amazed by the Furmintor. Even when i thought she was completely brushed with my old shedding tool - I couldn't believe the hair that I got out with the Furminator. You do have to be careful to do one stroke and move on to another area, as repeating on one area might make your dog sore. I wish I knew about this product years ago. Highly recommended!"
4,great but broken,I have only had the furminator about 4 weeks. I have already emailed the company as 5 teeth are broken and I do not know if they were that way when I received it or not. I love what it does for my animal and I do want to continue using it but I am being asked to send it back to the company. They will check it out and decide if it is going to be replaced or they will send me back my original and I will have to use it broken.
3,Best!,"I am very impressed at the amount of hair it removes!Which is a BIG deal, don't get me wrong! But I was hoping more for that ""I can't believe this is possible!!"" wow kind of factor. I don't regret buying it, and will continue to use and recommend this product."
5,furminator large yellow deshedding tool with 4-inch edge,This is a very good product. My dog is yellow lab and shed a lot. The floor looks much clear after I use the product for her once a week.
4,time saver,My dog is a German Sheperd/Husky mix and she sheds a lot.She loves getting brushed and this tool is no exception.Tons of fur is always on the ground after just a quick session with the tool.
5,Fulminate,Xlnt product. Worked very well on a cat that a regular brush was useless. I'm sure Kong appreciates it as much as I do. Thanks much
5,Furminator deshedding tool,Excellent deshedding tool! We have a yellow lab that sheds constantly. Everyday we fill a garbage can and see a reduction of hair all over the house. Buying from this vendor was great and also the price. I will be sure to check this vendor when I need additional items.
5,FURminator,"The FURminator was ordered from Amazon and received per agreement. This is an excellent tool for removing loose or dead hair off of your dog,if used often it really cuts down on the amount of shedding the dog does in the house and on carpet."
5,Best Pet Brush!,"I have 2 cats, one that loves to be brushed and one that does not. I have bought many brushes over the years hoping to find one that would work for my finicky girl. Not only does she tolerate being brushed now, she actually loves it! Thanks Furminator!"
5,Furminator,"This could not be more awesome! Works great. You will not believe the hair that makes up the ""undercoat"" of your dog! I have no complaints at all. It does exactly as it states. I have bought several brushes. This is by far the best. Well worth the money."
5,Awesome de-shedding tool!,Quick and easy transaction! Am in LOVE with this product! Can notice a significant difference in the amount of shed hair around the house. Exactly what I needed and got it from the perfect seller! Thank u!
5,furminator - medium,"This product will work great on your hairy dog. I have labradors and they are super hairy, but the furminator gets alot of the hair off so that they don't dirty up my house. I totally recomment this product, if you have never used this product you have got to buy it... I couldn't live without it!!! Best invention ever...."
2,Not good for long hair dogs.,I have a Pure Bred Border Collie and a Pure Bred blonde Collie. I purchased the furminator from a recommendation of my groomer. It may work for short hair dogs but for long hair dogs it does not work at all. It will pick up the top coat but I was under the impression it was for long hair dogs as well. Bottom line not pleased with the product. It does not do what it is advertised to do.
5,Furminator,"Very happy with product, gets all the dog hair off her better than any other product I've ever used. Not like a regular brush or comb, you need to be careful on how you brush your dog or cat."
5,Excellent grooming tool!,"I have a spoiled yellow lab whose favorite oasis in a sea of hardwood floors is our wool Persian rug, which is primarily navy and maroon. Needless to say, his shedding gave my Dyson (also highly recommended) quite a workout.After trying various brushes and shedding rakes, I tried the Furminator. What a difference! It effortlessly removed an incredible amount of fur. I wasn't able to vacuum for a couple days and noticed *much* less fur on the rug.The best thing about the Furminator is that my dog loves it. I don't have to hold him to comb him because he loves it so much.I can't recommend it enough. Excellent tool that is comfortable to hold."
4,Works great!,"Works exactly as I expected, based on the reviews I had read. Our dog is a short haired mix and he was really shedding bad in the Florida heat. The FURminator works."
5,A great buy!,"I use it on 3 of my dogs, all of which are horrendous shedders. The FURminator gets rid of TONS of hair, and the dogs' coats are shinier and healthier looking after brushing."
4,Furminator Help,I have 3 dogs and lots of hair. The Furminator helped tremendously with shedding. Great product!
5,"works great, but still takes a while","Got the furminator and tried it right away. It actually works,but you still have to brush your pet and that takes quite a while in the case of a golden retriever. I guess there's no magic solution to shedding, but the furminator is as close as I can get."
3,"Does an ""ok"" job",This doesn't take the hair off anyway near as efficient as the video shows. I rotate between this and an undercoat rake I purchased for eight bucks. My Golden Retriever seems to prefer the rake over the furminator.
4,Works fantastic for the Beagle/Spaniel; just ok for the Pit Bull,"Overall, well worth the money. I have a Springer Spaniel/Beagle mix and a Pitt Bull. It works miracles on the Spaniel! Sooooo much better than anything else I've tried. Her fur is just like a Spaniel, only short. It works ok on the Pitt Bull. Not a miracle worker or anyghting, but not bad. So, 5 stars for the Beagle/Spaniel mix; 3 stars for the Pitt Bull."
5,furminator,I have purchased 2 large pet furminator brushes-one for myself and one for my son. It is so easy to use and the animals like being brushed and they come out looking beautiful. Just like they went to a salon. They only thing to remember is not to use too much presure when grooming.
3,Furminator,"the size i ordered i thought was bigger , so the only downfall to this product is that i have to brush my dog with a few extra brushes, but he actually enjoys the massage"
5,Wonderful helper,"I was little hesitant to buy this, I thought it could one of another those things they have created that looks good but it's not that great... well, I was wrong, it's actually VERY good. I have a golden retriever with lots of hair, so I can see hair floating around the house every time it's sunny outside. I love my dog, but I need to be very patient with the hair all over my place. This FURminator has been really helpful, I brush her twice a week and I'm impress with the amount of hair I get. I'm quite happy with this."
4,Rosebud loves this thing!,Not only does it remove all that loose fur - my dog - Rosebud - loves it. If you scratch her head or back she will stand there forever - this is just as good as far as she is concerned.
5,Great product!,It works in seconds! clumps of hair just fall away. The medium size is good for cats. :) My cat always hated the comb I had for her but she loves this one. It relaxes them and truly gets rid of excess hair. wonderful.
2,Knock off- not real Furminator!,"The seller Wildlife is selling a cheap imitation product. I was very disappointed once I opened the package and realized this is not what I paid for.However, the comb seems to work OK, it removes hair from my 11mo. red lab's back and tail, but not his chest, head, or legs. I get better results from his $5 rubber curry brush! This is basically an flea comb attached to a plastic handle.Two stars for product, no stars for seller!"
4,Cannot live without!,"I have a 4 year old yellow lab that sheds like it's his job! This is perfect to help stop the fur balls that roam the house. He loves getting brushed out, and I love the amount of fur we get off him every time we brush him out. There is no brush out there that competes! A must have if your dog sheds a lot. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the price is a bit much for a dog brush."
4,Furminator Review,"The Furminator works fairly well with my Lab. I've noticed a lot less fur in the house after using this product on him. I don't quite get the results that you see in the videos, but the comb/brush does a decent job. It's pricey, but well made. I don't think it would be worth it for the full retail price. The Amazon price made the Furminator a good buy."
2,Not For Squirmy Cats,"The FURminator does not work well on cats who do not like to be brushed. The fur needs to be removed from the brush constantly and every time I stopped to do this my cat ran away. The FURminator did remove more fur than a regular brush so you will not have to brush your cat as often, however, with the amount of time and effort I had to put in I do not think this brush is worth the price."
4,The right product at the right price,"The furminator was recommended to me by a friend that pampers their dogs. I don't pamper my dog, but I do like to have her in the house at times. When she sheds it is a mess. Since we have gotten the fuminator the reduction of hair/fur has been 80-90%. So much so that my wife is not complaining. What made me happiest was the price I was able to purchase it at Amazon. The pet store sold it for the suggested retail or slightly below. Amazon made it reasonable for me to try out. Like I said, it was the right price for the right product."
3,Furminator Shedding Tool,I was disapointed with this product. Other shedding tools I have tried seem to work better or just as well.
5,Very nice brush,This brush works really great my my Alaskan Husky. And the service from this vendor was outstanding. Couldn't be happier.
5,Furminator,This item is the best thing we've ever purchased for our dogs. It cuts down on the shedded fur that we see around our home. We have 2 dogs and I would highly recommend it for other dog owners.
4,The Furminator,"Purchased this item after borrowing someones to give it a try. It was amazing how much fur I removed from my 2 dogs and 1 cat. I instantly noticed less hair around the house. The best part, all the animals loved being brushed with it.Great product."
5,best ever by far,"I have a Lab and a cat,so you can imagine the hair.I have bought brushes,combs,gloves,rakes etc.Nothing.Finally after seeing the customer reviews on the Furminator I took a chance.Its quite expensive but thats because it works and my dog and cat love being brushed.My cat is a Bengal and if you know about them they are a couple generations out of the wild and can be high strung.We brushed him 5 minutes ago and he was lying on his back getting his belly brushed.I have bought alot of things and this is the highest rating I have given."
5,the dog loves it,"i bought this based upon a recommendation of my daughter-in-law who has several dogs and swears by the tool.it came in three sizes and i chose the middle one based upon the size of my pooch.the furinator works like a champ and after about the third grooming it turns out the dog loves it, too.it does a great job of removing that winter build up of fur."
5,"Great product, lowest price",This brush works great on our Labrador Retriever's coat and helped a lot when he started shedding like crazy this Spring. We bought the 4 inch size. The Amazon sale price was half the price they charge in the stores.
4,Good Product,I use this on my 7 month old black lab approximately every 2-3 days to help keep the soft undercoat manageable. My puppy tolerates it and it does help keep the amount of hair that is shed to a minimum. You do have to be careful not to push to hard when using the brush because it can be uncomfortable for you dog.
4,This thing is a lifesaver...,"I purchased one for myself and a friend. We are both beseiged by fur as we have long haired cats. This tool is WAY beyond a ""regular brush"", seems to pull the loose clumps (which are normally around the house) as well as the top coat. I'm looking forward to fewer dust bunnies, and hair deposited on my clothes. It works! A great deal for the price."
5,wonderful!!,We have a mixed breed that has enough fur for three dogs and the Furminator has helped tremendously. I'm NOT constantly picking up clumps of fur like I had been.
4,Shed ender!,"This brush is very similiar to the ""As seen on TV"" version that is avail at Wally World for $9 -- the handles are all that is diff -- this is simply the more expensive version. I've told several friends about the brush & they have all gone & gotten it. I have a long haird beast of a cat -- a Maincoon -- she's all hair! A mini-cousin It! The brush works wonderfully on her. No hassles. No fighting her. And we could mold a new cat from all the hair it's removed! It even works as well on our short haired tabby.Try it -- you'll love it!"
4,"Great, but not as mind-blowing as expected","I'm pleased with this purchase, but not as blown away as I expected.The furminator does the job better than any other brush I've tried, but it didn't remove the huge amount of fur I was expecting. My dog is a relatively long-haired chocolate lab, and while the brush does a great job, for me it was not the miracle worker other reviews led me to believe. It does its job well, though, and while it won't completely remove your shedding problems, it's much more thorough than anything else I've tried. It did also work well for the greyhound who stays with us, but didn't work for the pit puppy!"
4,Works great for my furball,"Works just great for my 10lb white short hair cat. Seems like whenever I use it to brush the cat, we manage to remove about another cat-worth of fur from the poor creature. Hey, if it keeps it off my furniture and black clothes, all the better."
5,I Love This Thing!,"I have two Maine Coons who are three years old and are getting serious about shedding. The slicker brush just wasn't cutting it anymore. I didn't know what a Furminator was when I bought it, but I am so glad I did. Three or four swipes over the cat and you've got half a pound of fur off. Make your own spare cats! Collect them all or trade them with your friends!One thing to watch: the Furminator pulls the fur a bit, so slower is better. It doesn't hurt the cat; its more like it annoys them. They'll stay longer if you do it gently."
3,Only a little fur,"I have two labrador retrievers. Neither one has a lot of underfur, but do they ever shed. The promo of tons of fur didn't pan out. I'm beginning to think that the poor dog in the promo hadn't been taken care of in ages."
5,The Best Thing Ever,We have a dusty backyard and a SuperShedder. The first time we used this product it was a mountain of dirty dusty hair that would certainly have accumulated into the massive Dusty Bunnies ( bunnies seems like too small of an animal). Amazing. Dexter loved it. He feels so much cleaner and looks that way as well. So hopefully the constant struggle to fight the Dusties on the floor will be over. Great product. Buy this now!!!
5,Just like on TV!,"This is a great product! It works just like the Furminator shown on TV, but at a fraction of the cost. It's a great buy."
5,Awesome,"I have a Sybierian Husky, and this brush works better than any other bush I have tried. It also makes his coat look better."
5,Best Purchase EVER!!!!,This is the best invention!!! I have a basset hound and lab and I think I brushed at least a german shepherd off of both of them the first time. Both of my dogs have very shiny coats and the shedding is so minimal it's awesome!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
5,Easy to use,"I highly recommend the product. While I didn't get the startling results pictured on the website, I have to admit I only combed for about three minutes and had tons of hair. We have a shepherd mix with an ultra thick coat who is 13.5 years old, arthritic and very sensitive at his joints. This tool didn't hurt him a bit. The best part is that unlike all other products I've tried, it doesn't clog after three strokes. We bought the extra large size, our guy is 26"" at the shoulder. He still wouldn't let me do his tail, but he never has. The FURminator isn't hype, it really works."
5,it does what it sez,This product works as advertised. It eliminates the loose and undercoat hair from your dog. An excellent product even if it is a little pricey...gym
2,Okay but probably wouldnt have bought it,"I decided to try this a second time, to be sure, and if you really press hard it works better. It really requires more then 10 minutes if you plan to do a double coated animal. Well, after reading all the hype and me having multiple Australian Shepherds I decided to buy one. After using it for 10 min on each dog, I have come to the conclusion this thing is ""JUNK"" my rake and slicker brush removes far more shedding fur then this could do. I really wish I could have borrowed one first before wasting my hard earned money. The only thing I can see is it will remove the top coat, and a cheap shedding tool works better for that too!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was truly amazed by the Furminator! This thing is AMAZING! I have two indoor cats, a burmese and a siamese. You would have thought I had a third cat by the time I was finished.....The only downside is you need to make sure you do this either outside or somewhere you don't mind cat hair flying everywhere. The hair just keeps coming out.............so with one hand on the furminator, one on the cat, hard to pick up the hair after each run through the hair....This has really reduced the shedding and hair around the house.....WONDERFUL!"
2,Save your money,"Ok, this thing works, but not any better than a cheap dematting comb that I literally got in the $1 bin at WalMart. You know the type with a rectangular head with many small metal bristles spaced closely to one another and a handle coming off at an angle? Not only does that type of brush work better than the Furminator, but it does it quicker and with less mess. It holds the undercoat hair in the brush and all I have to do is pull it out and throw it away. With the furminator (and those looped blades) the hair goes everywhere and I have to pass it over my dog many more strokes to get the same amount of hair. Also, the Furminator takes good hair with the bad and pulls out topcoat no matter what you do. You can feel it ripping and pulling at the top coat. The cheap dematting comb does not do this. The take home message in all this is ""save your money"" and buy one of those cheap flat rectangular brushes and pass on the Furminator. I wish I had."
4,great tool,"We've only used this a few times but it's greatly reduced the amount of hair in the house! As usual, Amazon's customer service was great."
4,effective,This is very effective in removing undergrowth on our lab mix. The only drawback is its price. This is pretty expensive for such a simple product.
3,My dog loves it!,"After reading many reviews on this product I was very skeptical about purchasing it. I talked to my groomer who wasn't too thrilled with the product either. She said that it would probably be alright to use on the fluffy coat of one of my dogs, but it would ruin the coat of my smooth coat dog. Since it was half the price on Amazon I decided to buy it. Although my dog loves the furminator much better then being brushed it does not take off any more hair."
3,somewhat happy,it works well for our lab mix with shorter more wirey hair but our retreivers coat lost its sheen and luster. the furminator seemed to give him split ends and it also made his dry skin/allergy issues worse.
3,"Okay, but not great","I have an over-sized, plush coat German Shepherd and have wanted to try the Furminator for a long time. It is just ""okay"". Not much better than the rake and combs I have and a lot more expensive. It might work better for dogs with thinner coats, but just skims the top of mine and doesn't reach down deep enough to do a lot of good. Not worth the money."
5,This is a great tool,"I've seen these for sale in pet stores for upwards of $60-$80! I think those versions may have had a little doohickey that pushes the fur out of the comb, but I think that's a bit unnecessary. I have a black lab with thick coarse fur, and this thing does a great job of keeping it under control. I give him a good brushing with it once a week and it has significantly reduced the amount of fur shed around the house."
5,Works wonders,"It can get a lot of hair out. However, expect to spend a good amount of time using this. It take awhile."
1,Horror!,I used this on my Cairn terrier mix. It seemed to work to strip the undercoat - but when finished I realized that it had also stripped a lot of her outer coat. What a nightmare!
1,THIS FURMINATOR STINKS LIKE INSECTICIDE - MALATHION,"I have other Furminators and love them. I find that I never used the ""fancy"" push the fur out thingy, so I wanted to just get a plain one and this one STINKS. I can't use it. The smell transfers to your hands. I have sat it out in the sun for days hoping it would off-gas, but no. It really smells like malathion and if you have ever smelled that, then you know exactly the smell I am talking about.So I am just out the money since I've had it for weeks now and it's been open and outside and well, I don't know what is changed, but I am disappointed."
1,useless,This is the second one I've bough. First one broke after a couple months and on this one the handle broke on the first use ...
2,Dog yelps and growls in pain,"This seemed like the perfect thing, until we started using it on our corgi and he yelps and growls in pain every time. We've bathed him, checked for dirty places or scars or anything else that could be causing the problem. Can't figure it out, but we've never had this problem with normal brushes before. Perhaps it has something to do with the type of fur corgis have?We're going to continue to investigate, and if it turns out not to be the furminator's problem, I will adjust the rating as necessary.On a positive note, I tried it on our ornery cat today, and she couldn't get enough of the thing."
2,I don't buy it,"Yes, this little device yields a lot of fur, but I think that's because there are tiny razors in it, so it is cutting fur that wasn't even being shed. I think this because no matter how many times we brush we keep coming up with more fur, so the problem is never solved, and there is still cat fur all over the house."
4,I love the FURminator combs!,"They really do work. It's amazing how much undercoat and hair I can get in one brushing with my pet. Disappointed in the time it took to get to my home, however. I ordered on december 10...and it's not scheduled to arrive until January 23. It was supposed to be a gift for someone at Christmas...maybe a birthday gift now."
5,LOVE IT!,I was skeptical about anything that promised to control my dog's shedding. But the reviews were pretty impressive so I bought it. This thing is a life saver! I've never tried a deshedding tool before so I don't know how it compares to less expensive models. But I would highly recommend this. We got enough shed off my roommate's dog to make four new dogs. Both our dogs seemed to enjoy the feel of the tool as well. And being with my happy gal is so much more relaxed now that I'm not fighting hair and constantly cleaning up!
5,"Great for cats, too","This little thing works great. It really gets out the undercoat, is easy to use, and reduces shedding. Interestingly, it seems to work a little better on my short-haired cat than on the long-haired one, but is amazing on both. Well worth the cost."
5,Amazing.,"This tool is a must for anyone with a dog loosing fur. I have a similar tool (at least visually similar), but this one takes out almost 10 times as much fur - amazing. Our dog seems to enjoy it, too - I've brushed my arm with it and the tool doesn't seem to be sharp. Pressing too hard is not good, but it seems to extract and endless amount of unneeded undercoat.Somewhat on the pricey side (this offer here is cheaper than the same tool offered directly from Amazon!), but I've had it for about two months now and it's already worth it."
5,awesome,Great product at a great price. This thing works very well if you have the time to use it. Consistently works with no maintenance.
5,Great for long haired dogs,I have a chow chow mix and the Furminator works wonders on her!! Great product that use all the time! :)
5,The best,It works great for any breed of dogs. I have a puppy husky but I figured I would purchase this now so I can be prepared for when shes older and more fluffy.
5,No more shedding,"Excellent item! It really gets rid of all the fluff called the undercoat of my beagle. The newest generation (which I'm not reviewing) simply adds a little button that slides along the blade brush to assist in removing the collected hair, but it really isn't worth paying extra because at no point did I think it was hard to slide the fur off the brush. Get this if you're tired of vacuuming so much, it is worth it!"
4,Furminator price couldn't be beat!,"Our golden's coat looks wonderful . . . . have less hair in the house to vacuum. She loves the feel of the brush, though it is sharp and can cut her or others if you are not careful!"
4,A brush beyond other brushes,"I have used a variety of different brushes on my pets, but none of them have worked as thoroughly as a furminator. It takes my Maine Coon's undercoat to task. The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that this small one doesn't work as well as the larger one, and there is still a need for a secondary brush for collecting the hair that the furminator extracts from the undercoat. I highly recommend this product otherwise."
5,Impressed!,"I was very skeptical about this brush but decided to try it anyway. I was quite impressed with it. Hair still flies about as I brush, but if I clear the hair off the brush and put it in a bag it isn't so bad. I usually brush once a week and the loose hairs around the house stay at a minimum.This has proven to be a good product for me. I suggest you brush gently and follow the instructions for best results."
2,doesn't live up to expectations,"I wasn't too happy with this product. The teeth are too short to really reach the undercoat of my Eskimo/Border Collie. It does good with more short-haired dogs but I have found it lacking in performance with my longer haired pets. Unless you have a Chihuahua or other short haired dog, I would not recommend this product.FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge"
5,It was the best price I had seen on this product,This works great to remove the undercoat when my dogs are starting to shed. It is an easy and quick remedy. The price was half of what the local Petco sells it for.
4,FURminator does work!,"The FURminator works great for deshedding our Husky. She doesn't like it and doesn't love to have her fur brushed like some reviews I've read, but she is just that way. I let my friend try it on her Golden Retriever and again it worked great. They got enough fur off of her to make another Golden! And thier dog did love being brushed. I wasn't sure if the FURminator would be worth the money, but for the price I got it on Amazon.com it was well worth it!"
5,It actually works as depicted!,"FINALLY! A product that actually works as they depict it to work. I have three labradors and one cat and this product works extremely well on all pets. I had no idea there could be that much undercoat on my dogs and they could still have hair left! This did a fantastic job and was something that my animals seem to enjoy instead of being frightened of. It has made my animals happier, not to mention my sweeper!"
5,Best investment!,"Even though Golden Retrievers as a breed tend to shed all the time, I'd never be able to tell after using my Furminator. I found that I rarely get those annoying fur 'tumbleweeds' on my floor anymore as long as I use the tool a few times a week on my pup. I would highly recommend it to anyone who owns a dog that sheds."
3,A brush might have worked as well...,"This tool is okay, but I couldn't help but wonder if a brush would have worked as well, and if my cat would have liked a brush better. He doesn't seem to care for this tool much, and I have to use it more often than it recommends. Maybe I'm not being aggressive enough...I'd say for the money, it really isn't that impressive."
3,Furminator deShedding Tool,The tool takes a little of the hair off. My dog is a short haired Dalmation and it doesn't grab much hair. She still sheds all over the house. I would not buy it again.
5,Pet comb,Excellent pet deshedding comb that is sturdy and well made. Very pleased with the money saved going through amazon.com.
5,i am telling everyone about this,"I love the Furminator..the price from Amazon beat everyone..It is easy to use, sturdy and easy to remove the hair from the teeth. We have a German Shepard and I will say that it is not a one time and all the hair is gone, but it is the best so far. We are careful not to get too close to the skin as per instructions and it glides easily thru the hair. The best place for brushing is outside and have a cardboard box to put the hair in."
3,Thought I'd be more impressed,"With all the great reviews, and the price, I was expecting amazing results from this. I have 2 cats, one with long hair and a thick undercoat. I'm so tired of thick clumps of fur all over my house; I was looking for something that would get rid of the shedding undercoat for a while. This sounded like it would do the trick. I've used it twice and don't believe I'm getting as much fur off her as I do with my old Shedding Blade (which costs about half as much)."
2,Works same as much cheaper Shedding Tool,I found this Furminator worked exactly like the shedding tool that I bought for a fraction of the price in my local supermarket. Both are very messy so must be used outdoors.
4,Good for removing Cat Hair,Product was recommended by my vet. Have two indoor cats that shed a lot. Tool helps keep down on the cat hair in the house. Works much better than the normal brushes or combs sold for cats.
5,Good Product and the Price is Fair,"My dog loves this product but not my cat. But it works, I tried on my pets and it has lot of their loosing hairs attached."
5,furma-what?,This product was recommended by a a Vet's Assistant.She was spot on! This is one good tool. My dog is long haired andsheds a lot. After using the Furminator she is no longer shedding andscratching. I don't know how it works but it does. A bit pricey buthighly recommended.
5,Furminator,This product is great. Worked better than anticipated. The dogs coat looks shiny and healthy.
4,Truly amazing,The Furminator came recommended to me by my sister a vet and so I purchased it through Amazon at a great rate.First time I used it on my dog Laila (a mix Sheppard & Lab) and it worked fabulously taking off under-coat frommy dog and not hurting her or bothering her.
5,My Dogs Love This,I have 3 Yellow Labbies and a Golden Retriever.Every time I get the Furminator my dogs push each other aside to have me use it on them.Yellow Labbies shed all year and this is a must for them.
5,FURminator - wonderful product,"I didn't really believe that the FURminator would be so amazing. I use it on my golden retriever and long haired cat. The first time I used it, I think my cat lost 1 lb of unnecessary hair. Do yourself a favor and buy this product - you will not be sorry."
5,Fabulous tool! It works!,"I have a garden variety Tabby cat.The first time I used this tool, I noticed a reduction in the amount of shedding.It has almost eliminated fur on my clothes and furniture. Also, I have not noticed any hairballs.He tolerates the combing well. I highly recommend this tool to anyone."
5,furminator kudos,"The furminator is the most amazing product!! I have two dogs--so there's a LOT of shedding, but since I started using my furminator, there has been a huge difference! Each time we brush the dogs, a ton of extra dog hair is removed! Best pet brush ever invented!!"
1,WHAT A WASTE!,"I have persian cats - I called the manufacturer and asked what size to buy...took her recommendation. IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE A SWIPE THROUGH THE CATS HAIR! A waste of money. I mentioned it to the retailer but they did not offer to refund my money! Unless you have a short haired animal, don't waste the time to look it up."
2,Not so great,I bought this in hopes that it would greatly reduce the amount of hair my yellow lab leaves all over the house. After watching a video demonstrating the product I was hooked! When I got it home I wasn't so enchanted with the product. The MUCH cheaper shedding tool I purchased at Wal-Mart works 75% better at removing the hair. Save your money.
5,Fabulous,The Furminator is the best shedding tool ever!! I have 3 large dogs and I was drowning in fur balls. It was worth every penny!!I have been telling everyone I know about it.
5,Furminator,"We have four dogs with long hair and this product has been a lifesaver when it comes to keeping them and the house free of excess hair. Also, the delivery from the company was quick. I have no complaints."
2,"Works, but not as well as I would have hoped","I bought this originally because I had seen it used before. It worked so well, and my dog sheds quite a bit, so I was hoping to have the same success. However, it doesn't remove as much hair as I saw when originally used, and you have to press pretty hard to remove excess. Also, unless my dog is wet, it removes barely any hair. Quite disappointing."
4,Nice product,"The FURminator deShedding Tool works very well - better than any other product I have tried. The only drawbacks are that it is a bit pricey and you have to remove the hair more often than with other products (once the teeth clog up, the performance drops)."
4,furminator,"This tool works well on my short hair dog, but not quite as well on the long hair dog (it was advertised to work on both types)Even so, it works better on the long hair setter better than a regular comb."
2,OK TOOL,"We have a Retriever that seaonally sheds. Using this tool was dissapointing. It removes hair, but loads up too quick, and doesn't hold much. My dog will be patient with me for 10 to 15 min, and in that amount of time I simply can't remove that much hair. I can use a ""bed of pins"" type brush and remove a very large amount of hair in a short period of time, then follow up with this tool. The images that are show with this tool of pets surrounded by hair must have taken hours to accomplish. For the price, i wouldn't buy it agian."
5,Outstanding!,"The best brush ever! Ever!Go slow and easy, follow directions and let dog get used to it. You will remove mountains of dead, unwanted fur. Your dog will be happpppppyyyyy.The greatest brush I have ever used.BTW We looked for a deal on the older version (no self cleaning tool) and saved a bundle. Paid $20. On Amazon sold by Three Biz. Shipped fast and received fast. They may be sold out now but others had good deals as well, just not as good."
4,Fun to use!,"When you have a dog that sheds a ton, it's fun to get rid of the hair! The first time I used it, I had a baseball sized furball, from a Jack Russell. I do recommend trying to use it outside if possible. I was covered!"
3,Just ok,Does not work on dogs with thick coats. Works well on silky coat dogs like golden retrievers but not so on chow dogs or dogs with that type coat. Works well on cats.
5,Wonderful Item,Wonderful item to use on your dog. You'll be amazed at how much fur can be removed with the Furminator.
1,WATCH OUT - THIS TOOL IS A TRICK,"Man, when i first got this thing I was blown away.. I mean, look at the piles of hair I got off my four cats and my dog. Amazing, right? NO. My cat's coats look different, kind of like a man who's hair is thinning. Not only do their coats look less healthy, but not one of my 5 animals enjoyed it at all. They actually hated it and run away when they see it.As if that wasn't bad enough, all the animals still shed! I find random poofs of hair blowing across my floor like tumbleweed, and every time i pet the cats I get tons of loose hairs flying in my face... it is just as bad as before.People see this thing work and think it's the best. They see all the hair that was removed and get excited and buy it, just like I did. Don't pay attention to the big pile of hair that you removed, pay attention to life afterwards. PLEASE take my advise and stay away... this isn't just one review for one animal, this is a review for five different animals.STAY AWAY!"
2,Sucks.,"My dog has short hair but sheds. This thing barely picked up any hair, and you can't even use it on their bellies in case it tears a nipple! I sat in the yard combing her for half an hour and maybe came away with a small tuft of hairball the size of a quarter. This comb is probably meant for long-haired dogs...it definitely doesn't work on my Catahoula."
5,FURminator deshedding tool for dogs,My vet highly recommended this tool for our chocolate lab but the vet price was extremely high and so was Pet Smart so I searched the web and found it through Amazon.com at a very reasonable price. The best dog toll/comb ever made and sure cuts way down on dog hair in the house. Our lab loves to be combed with it.
5,works as described,This item works just like it says - gets to the undercoat on our dog - just brush lightly. We had just brushed her using the regular brush and were very surprised to see how well this furminator took additional undercoat off. We would definately recommend this product.
3,Would Not Buy Again,"I bought this for my two AussieBos (Australian Shepherd/Border Collie). One is a long hair and the other a short hair. It works the best on the short haired dog. But it doesn't work any better on him than the undercoat rake. On the long hair dog, it ""frizzes"" her hair.Her hair looks damaged from the use of the brush--like it causes major split ends or something:-) Her hair stays frizzy for a few days after use. It also does not get through her thick outer coat to the fuzzy undercoat. I bought this when it was under $10 on Amazon. There is no way I would pay any more for it. I really prefer the undercoat rakes to this brush. The only real positive I can say is that I think the short hair dog finds it a little more comfortable than the undercoat rake."
2,"Useful, but...","I have two cats - one who likes to be brushed and one who doesn't. The furminator worked well for the one who likes to brushed. The one who doesn't like to be brushed wouldn't sit still for the furminator, even though the advertising suggested that some cats who don't like to be brushed enjoy brushing with the furminator. But even for the one who likes to be brushed, the furminator did a comparable job to what a simple flea comb can do. Try using a flea comb before spending $23 on the furminator."
5,best ever,I would not have belived it unless i saw it. This tool took out more hair than I have ever seen on my main coon who hated to be brushed more than 10 minutes the first time we used it he stayed still for 45 minutes. It also worked well on our Lab best brush ever.
5,Right Tool for the Job,"We have three large, very furry dogs, two Golden Retrievers and an Aussie. The Furminator really helps control the piles of fur that collect within minutes around the house. In addition, the dogs love to be furminated and push each other out of the way to be the first in line when the Furminator comes out. If you have large dogs, consider buying the large size. It does save time. My three dogs say if they had thumbs, it would be twelve thumbs up."
5,an amazing grooming tool,We have used many different grooming tools with our three big siberian huskies and nothing works as well to get out the deep layers of undercoat as does this little tiny furminator comb. It is truly amazing. We lost our first one so are now buying another.
4,Good product,I bought it during a promotion and paid much less than the regular price. It works very well on my German Shepherd Dog. I recommend this item.
5,"FURminator, an appropriate title indeed!","We have a Welsh Corgi, and besides chewing stuff his favorite hobby is to shed. I bought the brush hoping it would help eliminate some shedding issues. Boy does this thing work well! Every single stroke you take this thing grabs a nice bunch of hair... regardless of how much you brush! It seems as though the hair is never ending, and after 5-10 minutes, you'll have a nice pile of hair at your feet. The dog's coat is much softer, cleaner, and that's just less hair in the house!"
4,"Good tool, but doesn't stop shedding","This tool works good on our shepherd mix who has thick, short to medium hair. Every time I use it on him I get a couple handfuls of his fluffy white undercoat, thus it does its job perfectly. However, he still sheds like crazy the rest of the time. If he's lying on his side and you pet him for awhile, his side will be covered in loose fur. I don't know if it's the difference in his undercoat versus the more wiry topcoat or what."
5,Fruminator Review,"Bought this as a replacement for one that had been given as a gift. The little teeth on the 1st one ultimately started to fall off, so these won't last FOREVER, but they really do a great job. This works differently from other brushes and is better. We have an English Golden Retriever who sheds a lot. The first few times I used this, it generated a lot of hair. Then with continuous follow up (like once a week), less hair came off. It really makes the dog look great, too. Best of all, there seemed to be less of his hair all over the house. Make sure to brush outside because of all the hair it removes."
4,Hey its a Furminator,"I have been using these for my German Sheppard's for five or six years and I will say that this thing works.I bought this one because I went on a four month road trip and forgot the 'new' version and it works great.As always if you never used one and have a dog with an undercoat, please have a large garbage bag to putall the hair in, because you will get a lot of it.Once I get the dog brushed really well and by that I mean two to three times a day, maybe five minutes each time,I can sit back for about three days before I brush them again. Use this and you will notice a huge decrease indog hair on your clothes, furniture or the little 'tumbleweed' dog hair racing across your hardwood floors.I really love the Furminator and it is the only brush I use now.Timahh"
4,Works good more expensive than it should be,"It has worked great removing dog/cat hair. We like that when the hair comes off the animal it doesn't fly all over the place. We have noticed a reduction in fur around our house and our dog's coat does look really nice. Our cat's ""dandruff"" flakes have also lessened. We bought the large size and it was priced the best by far on Amazon.com but I feel it should still be priced less. I would never buy it for the retail price."
1,Waste of money - Please read,"The FURminator was a complete disappointment. Even for a short fur dog, the 4 inch edge is loaded with 3mm deep bristles that do not penetrate the fur deep enough or firmly enough so as to capture the loosened hair. I was surprised because I've read so many reviews and people have been raving about it.I compared it to a similar one at Petsmart that goes for +$40 and I've noticed that the bristles tend to be lined up in a v shape to each one - versus the one shipped to me where they are just straight and don't capture anything. So basically I bought a small metallic hair comb for a lot of money. I should have returned it but threw away the packaging.Don't waste your money on it. It's a rip off"
5,Great Product,"This is a great product, my dogs just love getting brushed with the FURminator. I have four dogs, while brushing one the other three are trying to knock me over for their turn. I also use it on my furniture, works better than the vacuum cleaner. Highly recommended, especially if you have dogs that shed a lot."
1,FURminator tool,I have a Lhasa Apso with hair that feels like cotton & tangles easy. This tool does nothing but pull & thins her coat. It does not help at all. I had heard alot of good things about it and I was disappointed when I paid so much for it and I could have gone to Sally's Beauty Supply and get a $5.00 thinning comb (which I did) & got the same results except it doesn't pull. The thinning comb helps with the matts.
2,Dogs dont like FURminator,I have 2 weimaraners who love to be brushed. I tried this with them and they both hated it. The blade is so sharp it was uncomfortable for them. I gave it two stars because it did get lots of hair out. I think this would be best for long haired dogs.
2,What's all the hype about?,"I have an Australian Shepherd and I use the Furminator regularly. Nevertheless I don't get THAT much undercoat out when I rake him with it, and he still loses lots of hair all over my house. Maybe his coat is just too long for this... I would not recommend it to anybody with a long haired dog."
3,Decent comb,"I see lots of hype about how this is the best thing since the last best thing. I'm not seeing it. I've used other combs on my Husky/Lab mix in the past and they do as good if not better. I think what works for this on my dog is if I press harder and ""dig in"" a bit. Maybe that's the trick. It's an okay unit. I wouldn't have paid $40 for it."
5,Sam loves it,"This is great for both the owner and the pet. Our shelty Sam just lays back and enjoys the attention and it's pretty good at removing a lot of hair that would otherwise wind up rolling across the floor as ""SAMbleweeds"""
5,great product,"This thing is amazing. I use it on a short-haired dog (lab mix) and also, very gently, on a long-haired cat. The animals tolerate it very well. The dog puts up with it; the cat seems to enjoy it."
2,Fur flying!,"Tool does remove hair, but is very very messy. Best if used outside. Requires weekly combing, not monthly as advertised. Cats DO NOT enjoy it as much as those on TV."
2,save your money,"I've got a Siberian Husky that sheds endlessly. Bought this product online after seeing the mountains of hair come off of a retreiver in their promo video. I've gotta say that this product works marginally well on my dog's shorter haired areas: ie, extremities and chest- but not as well as my kong zoom groom. the furminator is virtually useless on the other 85% of my double coated dog. let's face it... somebody decided to stick the non-cutting top half of an electric hair clipper blade onto a handle and market it. kudos to them, but shame on me for getting suckered by ad wizards."
1,Worse than a bad haircut!,"I was excited to use this brush on my Golden retriever. I started at the shoulders like is said to do. My dog didn't mind the brush at all. Just after a few strokes I examined her hair and to my horror Her coat was ruff, course and shred, the soft under coat and the gaurd hairs torn up. I returned it then and there. Her coat has not recovered in the areas I used this tool on and it has been over a year since the horrific incident!Worse than a bad haircut! A year later still in recovery :("
3,"Great deshedder, hated by my cat",Pro: this does an amazing job of getting fur off your pet. You honestly won't believe how much hair comes off. It's astonishing.Con: my cat hates this worse than anything. I can't bear to brush her with this (even softly) because it makes her so miserable and she devotes all her energy to trying to bite and scratch me as I brush her.A great product that I can't really use. Too bad!
3,"It works, just not as well as expected","I first saw a product demonstration video at my vet's office. I am tired of picking dog hair off my clothes so I wanted to try this for myself. I found this on the Friday Sale so I ordered one. When it arrived I wanted to use it immediately. If you read the directions, your pet has to be clean and dry so I had to wait for after bath time. Once I did finally use it, it didn't get as much hair off as it did in the video. Maybe I didn't press hard enough?? I didn't want to press too hard or it might cause an irritation. It did get some hair off but I wouldn't say any more than a normal brush would."
5,No More Fuzzy Kitty!,"""Unbelievable"" is the best word I can think of to describe how the Furminator works! Our cat, Casey, is the world's biggest ""scaredy cat"" when it comes to brushing time. But he will actually walk up to the Furminator to be brushed! It is completely amazing to see how much hair the Furminator removes! You have to see it to believe it!!!"
2,Huh? I just don't get it.,"These raving reviews make no sense to me. I have a pomeranian, and they shed a lot, and this tool does nothing. The only thing that makes this product ""worthwhile"" would be that it doesn't seem to hurt my dog. But very little hair comes off when you use it.I would just not buy this item. Not worth the price. At all."
5,WOW WOW WOW,This really work and the dogs love it....We have a Golden and a Bernese Mountain Dog..tons of hair gone..
4,Amazing tool that needs a gentle touch,"It takes out more hair than a traditional pin brush. My golden didn't like it at first because he has sensitive skin. I realized there doesn't need to be a lot of pressure exerted to extract the undercoat of his thick hair. I borrowed a neighbors' brush (she has 2 English Mastiffs) before I purchased my own, and the furminator does appear to dull after much use. I am not sure how old her brush is but it is not sharp enough to remove the same amount of hair as a new one. Not sure how long of a shelf life this brush will have, but it's great for now..."
5,Great Product,Very happy with the FURminator. We have a white lab and product is working as promised. Looking forward to cleaning the floors less often.
5,FURminator Large gets the job done!,"After purchasing several different and ineffective brushes, mitts etc, I decided to give this a try since the reviews were so compelling. I agree with them completely! IT'S the BEST for thinning dog coats. I have a german shepard mix who sheds constantly and leaves the house a mess. Vacuuming took hours to get the carpet hairfree in the past, but now I'm collecting about 1/5 as much hair each time and getting done much faster. In addition, when we pet Cody, our hands and clothes are not covered with hair any more!THIS IS GREAT!!! I've demonstrated the results to my neighbors (bags of removed hair and no long hairy area between my dog's legs any more) and 2 of them have also purchased it in the past week for their golden retrievers.THANKS for a wonderful product that lives up to it's name and reputation."
5,Furminator,"Great product, but don't ask the dog. It takes several uses to get the majority of hair. But once I got most of the hair out, she tolerates it better now."
5,The FURminator is awesome.,"I have a golden retriever and have tried many tools to remove his constantly shedding hair. None have really worked -- some have been too rough on his skin and others didn't catch the loosened hair so that the hair just flew all over the place. My dog likes being groomed with the FURminator, and it captures all the loose hair that it removes. Grooming is not messy and more hair comes out than I could ever have imagined possible. I highly recommend it."
4,The Furminator Really Works,"I have a yellow lab and she sheds continuously. At my wits end, I heard about the furminator from a friend so I decided to try one, even though the price seemed high to me.It really does the trick. Just a few minutes of brushing in the morning and my lab is set for the day. We don't have to vacuum or swiffer the floors near as often as we used to. I'm a satisfied customer!"
5,un freaking believable!,I just received the furminator today and immediately tried it out on my yellow lab. Wow! I couldn't believe the hair it removed with simple light strokes. She loved me doing it and in a matter of minutes I had a second dog (the hair I removed from her)! Later in the day I had people comment on how pretty and soft her coat was and I've been sharing this product with everyone I can tell. Highly recommended. Actually better than that. This is the best purchase I've made for my dog and me.
3,Furminator,"This product is Okay, seeing the videos they have online are not exactly the results I got. It still works good as a dog brush."
4,"Great deshedder, used consistently","This is the best deshedder I've ever used on my aussie, but it needs to be used regularly to get results. Pricey, but worth it."
4,furminator,"It takes a while but it does work. I had a rake for the fur and I would say that this is a good addition to it. If you have a large beast with tons of long hair, you'll find that it doesn't go very deep into it and that's where a rake comes in handy. The furminator does do a great job on the top coats and especially where the dog has shorter hair. It's not a miracle wand but it helps to cut down on shedding."
5,FURminator is a must have...,Having tried nearly every de-furing tool available I cannot tell you how satisfied I am with the FURminator. The dogs(Golden retriever & Yellow Lab) think they are being petted while fur by the handful is being removed. In the past I have had to work to control them long enough to finish. This is one item that you will never regret purchasing.
4,furminator,"The furminator is rather disappointing for using on a longer haired dog. Nothing like shown on TV. I think the dog they show on TV must have been ""furminated"" for hours before filming and showing to the general public. Eventually the product would probably be as shown on TV but there are many many hours between start and meeting expectations. In the meantime, be prepared to put up with the usual amount of dog hair on everything."
5,Best Brush I've EVER used!!!,"I use this exact comb on my cat, 2 short hair dogs, and a big fluffy dog too!! None of them have ever really enjoyed being brushed, but with this they don't seem to mind so much and it really does a FABULOUS job of getting rid of all the loose hair. Just be prepared w/lots of trash bags!!! :)"
4,furminator does what they say it does,"Although it is expensive compared to other dog brushes, Amazon gave me the best price. My dog has a lot of undercoat that is shedding all over the house. Unlike my other dog brushes, the Furminator did a great job in alleviating the shedding problem. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. If the price was cheaper, I'd give it a 5 out of 5."
4,Works really good,It worked really good on my St. Bernard/ Chesapeake Bay Lab Retriever Mix. He has Lots of hair. Didnt get as much hair off him at I'd hoped for but he had just gotten a bath and dried and I'd say there's a lot of hair on his dog bed :)
5,title,"So, for a 'brush', this one is pretty expensive. It is, however, the most rugged feeling brush I've owned. It has a very heavy rubber handle that makes it super easy to grip. I anticipate this lasting for a very long time... The blade is heavy duty too.Now, how does it work? Holy cow! My yellow Labrador enjoyed a treatment with this thing... no hair pulling-the outer coat was not affected at all. However, each stroke came up with a handful of undercoat--an entire handful--in each stroke! This seamed to go of forever. I couldn't imagine she had so much hair.So, anyway, I like it, I like it a lot. When I lose this one (I'll not wear it out or break it) I'll certainly buy another... even at $30 after shipping."
1,Cat fur,The small deshedding tool does not work very well on my cat's thick fur. Will have to take her to the vet for help with the spring shedding.
1,YOU WILL **HURT** YOUR ANIMAL. DO ***NOT*** PURCHASE THIS.,"When I first got the FURminator, I was actually really surprised at how well I *thought* it worked. I got TONS of hair out of my dog, and per instruction I only used this thing once A MONTH.By the second month, I noticed my dog (Whose really obedient and sweet)was scared to DEATH of this thing. It didn't make any sense. I continued brushing her. One thing I noticed is the dog looked REALLY unhealthy, her fur was patchy and it looked horrible, but, Then I saw the long cuts along her back. It was horrible, MY STOMACH LITERALLY CHURNED WHEN I REALIZED I WAS HURTING MY DOG.This is NOT a safe item and should be banned! Just because you're getting out tons of fur does NOT make it a good thing!"
1,Sceptical,Now that I have your attention. I rate this dog brush 4.5 out of 5. When a new to me product comes to my attention I do not rush out to buy it before I can see it or try it or talk to a friend that has one. In the case of the Furminator I was not able to find one locally. But I was impressed with the video demonstrations. After comparing prices at other web site locations I took a chance that it might be worth the investment. Well I don't get piles of fur like in the video but there has been a remarkable reduction of dog hair on our rugs. Our German Shepherd Dog Toby looks better and the vacuum cleaner operator (me) does not have to empty the bag as often.
2,Fur-ELIminator it is NOT,"Having 3 dogs and 2 cats I was excited to learn of this product. I thought it was expensive but it sounded worth it-that it would be so much better than any other comb or brush. Well, it wasn't. Sorry I wasted my money!"
3,"Works OK on long hair, not as good as newer version",This works fine on longer hair dogs but not as good as the newer version and doesn't do much for medium and shorter hair.
5,love Love LOVE it!,I could not believe the amount of hair my short haired baby gave up when I use this tool on him----it has seriously helped the whole shedding adventure!!
5,Furminator is a fantastic tool!,"This product is wonderful! We have 2 dogs - a long haired Border Collie and a short haired yellow Lab-Chow and sometimes their shedding is overwhelming. This little tool is amazing. The only problem is that the hair that comes off of the Lab-chow is so fine that it flies all over the place so get yourself a bag to try to put as much as you can inside of it. The Lab-Chow was always skittish about brushing but he holds perfectly still for this. The only thing is, I can't tell when to stop grooming! I don't want to make them bald but the hair keeps on coming! Any hints?"
1,Doesn't work on LONG fur,"All I read and heard was that this grooming tool was amazing. My rough collie has very thick undercoat and of course, long hair. I was excited about my purchase. I received it within 2 days, and that was with the free shipping! That's the one star. I read the instructions, went to their website, even searched for other rough collie owners using this tool,and gave my collie a bath with his medicated shampoo.To make a long story short(pun intended), very little fur was removed. My rake does a much better job. I have used it on neighbor's dogs to make sure I was using it correctly, and they were so impressed, they went online to purchase."
3,Works but...,Does remove more fur than average brush but must use much care when brushing as can pull fur; also fur cannot have tangles; decent product; might work better on dog with shorter fur; (have a medium sized dog-35lbs-retriever/chow/etc. mix)
1,I just don't get it!,"so many folks rave about this 'tool' and I still have no idea what they're talking about! I have two large dogs with lots of hair. I've tried using the Furminator - tried using it at different angles even, and get little to no excess fur from them. Using a cheap rake produces much better results in less time. It gets 1 star because there's no option for '0' star. I'm $40.+ lighter. P.T. Barnum was right again."
1,Not all it's hyped up to be!,"I had heard such rave reviews about this VERY PRICY comb. I have Aussies... not a difficult coat. I thought this would make short order of daily grooming. It appears to not go very deep below the guard hairs, and I feel like I need to go over the same area repeatedly. It's just too much work. I'm pretty disappointed!"
5,Amazing!,Amazing product! The furminator definitely works! I thought the YouTube videos about this brush were just extreme cases but I saw the same results on my dog who doesn't normally shed much. I definitely recommend this to anyone with a dog who has long hair.
4,Great for Dogs and Cats,It truly does work. We use it on our dog and that hair that comes off is amazing. We also tried it on our cat who's a medium haired and it even worked better.
4,Brush with caution.,"The blade is pretty sharp. You have to make sure you brush your pet very lightly so as not to hurt or irritate their skin, but the brush itself does work wonderfully on my dog's coat. She's a german shepherd mix and never stops shedding. There is a noticeable difference for a few days after using this brush."
5,Great for boxer-mix,"I first heard about the furminator through a friend and tried it. Loved it so much I got one for my own boxer-mix dog. Is a wonderful tool, there's no point in using any other brush on my guy, this is the best brush I have EVER used!"
4,Hair Hair Everywhere,"The Furminator is a quality product that really gets the job done when removing loose pet hair from your furry friends. I especially recommend this product if you have a cat. We have a long haired cat and he sheds everywhere, and a lot. When we furminate him, he looks like he has lost 5 pounds. Not only does it help remove hair, but keeps your pets looking young and slim. A great product!"
5,Furminator,"The FURminator works excellent for removing loose dog hair and giving your pet a shiny coat, not to mention making the pet more comfortable and cooler. It's the best product I've found for removing loose dog hair and this was the BEST price around."
5,It works!,Recommended by our kennel and it really did the job. Our lab was shedding her winter coat and keeping up with the hair was impossible. Combing everyday or every other day sure helped wih the cleaning. It's the best brush I've found to date.
3,Furminator is OK,"In general this tool seems to do a good job and perform as advertised. I have one cat who really enjoys being groomed with it. It pulls out masses of his undercoat. He is a short-haired cat. Unfortunately, the long-haired cat I really wanted to use this on seems indifferent and tends to walk away when he sees it coming.My dogs don't care for it much, either.I have read other reviews saying that cheap brushes from Wal-Mart remove as much hair as the Furminator does. I would tend to agree, although I think the Furminator gets more of the undercoat out and breaks less top hairs. I think it probably helps more with shedding than a cheap brush.My other issue with the Furminator is that it doesn't hold a lot of hair. Stopping to clean it out frequently is inconvenient. Most brushes hold more hair and consequently may be faster to use.But I don't regret buying it an would do it again."
2,"Eh, only worked as a basic brush. Didn't do anything to Fur.","I had high hopes for this thing. My dog is a Jack Russell Terrier and she tends to shed a lot of her short hair all over the sofa, clothes and carpet. So, I bought this in hopes to prevent as much hair going all over the place. I didn't expect it to solve my problem 100%, but I had hoped it would help even 50%. As I used it, it didn't seem to grab any hair. It only worked as a brush for my dog. I have tried several ways of using it and different positions in hopes of it grabbing more hair to no avail. I am a little disappointed that I did not experience what everyone else has, which makes me think maybe there is a trick to it that I do not know?"
2,I'm undecided about it,I think it definitely gets more loose fur off than other brushes but I wouldn't say it does as well as some of the pics. A good work out for your arm that's for sure. Kinda heavy and doesn't work well on smaller animals or on short hair like a pit bull.
4,Save your furniture and clothes from pet hair!,"Ordering the FURminator brushes on Amazon is much cheaper than buying them in stores like Petsmart or Petco, but that's no surprise. I'm really pleased with the FURminator brush because fur unloads from the brush so easily/quickly that I can brush my cat before he gets annoyed or tired and runs away. I've used the brush on my short-haired cat and my long-haired, large dog and not only did it remove a ton of extra fur, but it kept my pets from shedding for a longer period of time than the previous brushes. I wish the brushes were less expensive so that I could buy several different sizes to do more detailed work."
3,good undercoat brush,This is a good undercoat removal tool but it is my opinion it does little to reduce loss of top coat hair which is the main problem with our Black Lab. Also be very careful not to use it too much as I would wager over use is not too good for your dog. I only use it once a week and am very careful not to over do it. It is very expensive and I really prefer the Zoom Groom's softer application.
5,worth it,My yellow lab sheds like crazy. I've used regular dog brushes and I swear I think using that makes her shed more. Plus I start losing some of the bristles too. This FURminator is awesome! After using it several times I can really tell the difference. It's not cheap but I think it's worth the money!
5,This is the BEST dog grooming item I've ever purchased!,"I have several Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and let's just say, they SHED! A groomer friend of mine spoke of this product so I thought I'd give it a try. I can't say enough! It really removes your animals undercoat without any pulling or discomfort. I find that if you use the Furminator every week for about a month during shedding season, you'll not only have a happier and cooler pet, but MUCH less hair everywhere else! My only wish is that I'd been the one to invent it.... You will NOT be disappointed if you buy this product."
3,Doesn't really live up to hype,"My dog sheds like nobody's business, and I was very excited to watch the video showing the mounds of hair that can come off a dog when you use this tool.When it came in the mail, I immediately called my dog outside to put the FURminator to work. I was pretty disappointed. While I did see some hair come out while using the FURminator, it didn't seem to be that much more than the slicker brush I ussually use on my dog, let alone the MOUNDS of fur that I was expecting to pull out.Don't fall for the hype around this one -- it's not worth the price tag."
5,Best Tool EVER,"I recieved this product Yesterday. Have had at least 3 pets in the house at a time for the past 15 years, and NEVER have I used a tool that was this easy to use and did such an effective job at removing shedding hair. I have already recommended this product to 4 other petowners who have purchased."
3,Pretty good product,"This product works fairly well. Our dog has a more ""wired"" texture so it wasn't able to run smoothly through her hair. I also don't care much for the design - it's harder for me to control where I am combing with this handle - I would rather that it was more like a regular comb. I used it on our cat but must say that I prefer a regular flea comb because of the design and the flea comb seems to pull out just as much hair."
3,O.K. But Not A Gold Star,"I bought this for my one cat, who has short, but extremely thick hair. It works o.k. in conjunction with her comb and other brushes, but not as well as advertised."
4,"Great Product, my dog loves it","I use this tool almost every day and it gets off a huge amount of fur each time. My dog really enjoys just being brushed. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it said it would reduce the amount of fur on the pet, but it hasn't done that yet. But it is a great tool for de-shedding."
5,This is the ONLY brush you will need!,"I have a 13 year old chow chow and this is the first brush that I have found that will get rid of all of her under fur. I have about 8 other brushes and none of them have worked as well has as the Furminator. If you have a double coated breed, then the furminator is the brush for you. Stop wasting you money on lesser quality brushes and make the investment in the Furminator. Chewie loves having me brushing her with the Furminator. She used to snarl when I used other brushes because they would pull on her fur but this one only removes the soft, fluffy under fur. I've already removed 3 grocery bags of underfur and have only had the furminator about a week. I can't wait to get all of the under fur out especially in time for the hot summmer here in Atlanta."
5,"So worth buying, it works just like the commercial.","If you are on the fence of buying this product, come on over. It delivers everything promised.I have a black lab mix, and I could never get any hair off of her from any brush, maybe a handful after an hour of brushing. I would always find her hair all over the house and I finally got fed up when I found it in some food I made. Gross!I came here and purchased the furminator and very glad I did. In one sitting I pulled more hair off of her than I did in her entire life. Her fur is extremely soft and shinny now, and plus no loose hair in my food anymore!This brush is worth the investment! Stop debating if you want to buy it or not. Amazon has the lowest price, believe me I shopped around forever, and no one compares to Amazon."
5,Furminator,this is a god sent product. It was a great price and great shipping. it is working wounders on my two siberian husky's. thank you
5,Furminator Works,I have used the Furminator on our short haired cat. It seems to work well. We received the order in a timely manner.
5,Furmination a success!,"I will start by saying that I had no idea my dog had so much loose hair. This is worth every penny!! The first time took me about 2 hours to fully clean but now I use it every 2-3 weeks and only do it for 45 min to 1 hour, I used the shampoo which I think helps, the key is to stay consistent with use. I have a 6 month old that I don't want developing allergies so this did the trick. My dog feels softer; practically no hair on the floor so cleaning is easier; my baby can enjoy playing with the dog without getting hair on his hands and mouth! Win, win all around! Don't buy it at the pet store, too expensive. Buy it through this seller it was fast and everything came in perfect condition."
4,Big help,"This works well to control shedding from our basset hound. You do need to be careful around sensitive areas, contours, and areas where there isn't much hair over skin or bony areas."
5,Must Buy,"I have a three year old shepherd and he loves this! Gets all excited when I pull it out. Pulls from the under coat and prevents a lot of the shedding in the house. Try to do it once a week outside. The rubber handle does have a tendency to pull away from the head, but no biggie"
5,the Furminator,The Furminator is absolutely amazing! It has made my pets look healthier and younger by getting rid of the undercoat.
4,The dog loves it,"My dog did not like the provious brushes. the last being a matrix of rubber fingers that worked well. However now, my dog is exited about the massage provided by the furminator."
5,"Very nice grip, wide area helps!","I have two pugs and a golden, and this tool is such a help. The house has a lot less fur, but you have to be diligent about de-shedding the pups. It works really well, and taking the fur out of the teeth is very easy."
5,furminater de-furs nicely,"speedy delivery, pricey product, but the online price was considerably cheaper than if I had purchased the product at the pet store."
5,"Big Difference, Best Out There, Worth It.",I hesitated to spend $20.00 on a cat comb even on sale but this one is waymore effective in geting the job done than anything I ever used before. Ihave a shorthair kitten but the amount of dead hair it removes is amazing.Your pet will have a healthier and shinier coat in a short time: worth it!
4,Pet Shedding Brush,"This may be a bit pricey for brushing your cat or dog, but it is way worth it. The hair comes off easily and the pets love to be brushed with it."
5,helped keep sheeding down,"We use this on our short hair cat, golden retriever, and our bernese mountain dog. It works especially well on our golden and our cat, I think our berner is just so larger and still a puppy, she is impatient with any brushing. It has helped with the amount of shedding in our house which we really try to keep to a minimum (we try) since we just found out our son is allergic to cats and dogs. It does work very well with the shampoo made by the same company for deshedding."
4,not the most updated furminator,"This product works great but is not the most up to date model. Certainly the price was better than for the most recent model, but does not have the 2 combs with the push out cleaning. I would still highly recommend the product it removes tons of the loose fur and my dog does not mind it-make sure you read the directions, can be harsh on pet's skin if not used properly."
5,God Send,"We own 2 german shepherds and one lab/chow mix, this item is wonderful. Shepherds are known for having two coats, and this item does the job. Alot of hair coming off and you can see the beautiful shiny coat with very little effort!!!"
5,Awesome! No more hair everywhere; this works like a charm!,"If you were wondering about the Furminator and whether or not it works, wonder no more! This is the BEST hair removal brush I have ever used on my dog, who is part German Shepard, part Border Collie and ALL hair everywhere. Since I have been using the Furminator there is no longer hair all over the place and my dog's coat looks shiny and healthy too."
2,yup,"I agree with what other thick haired dog owners are saying...This comb does NOT work well on my chow mix.It works ok on my short haired corgi; but like other people pointed out, the fur sticks to the dogs or floats around the house like little tumbleweeds.I think the FURminator is WAY over rated and definitely not meant for all breeds."
3,You will get tons of hair off,We have not used our furminator but a couple of times. We were not sure how often we could use it. I guess it has to be used regularly to reduce shedding by 90%. I think it will be effective with regular use. Our two labs shed like crazy all year long and we need something that works.
5,Excellent Product,"I was very happy with my order of the Furminator, and also with the price.It's a good product and it works!!"
5,Awesome,"My wife wanted to get this tool. I was not so sure, but as any good husband I listened. Once I saw her using it on our dogs and the amount of hair it removed, well I fully recommend this brush."
5,the fantastic furminator,"We recently purchased the furminator to try on our border collie & were amazed with the results. We tried many different brushes before this & we still always had an abundance of hair on our floors almost instantly after vacuuming, now we don't have to vacuum as often as we don't have any where near as much hair coming off the dog. It's the best thing ever!!!"
4,"Furminator, deshedding tool","I purchase this deshedding tool for $30.00 thinking that it should be wonderful and different from the other one cheaper that I had purchase before. It works fine, I just don't think it should be so expensive after all it's not any different from a cheaper tool. I feel robbed and cheated."
5,furminator,"I own a Great Pyrenees that sheds a tremendous amount of hair. My brother in law recommended the furminator to me. I works wonderfully, easily removing the under coat. Thanks for a GREAT product."
5,Wow,Highly recommend this brush. It has changed our lives! We only have to vacuum about once every 4 days instead of twice a day now! If you have any kind of dog/cat that has an undercoat or sheds I definitely recommend this product.
4,"FURminator with 4"" Edge","The product was delivered as described. I had heard that it didn't work that great on a Kuvasz coat so I borrowed one. It worked great on my dog and he tolerated it well. Once I received my own, I had directions to read and lightened my touch and it was still excellent. I highly recommend the device for dogs with a heavy undercoat. He still sheds quite a bit, but that's partially my fault for not brushing regularly."
4,Excellent Product!,This deshedder works very well on our lab mix that was a big problem shedder!Glad to find it!
1,disappointment,"I have a Welsh Corgi, otherwise known as a shedding machine. Another Corgi owner told me how well the Furminator worked on his dog, so I bought one. The Furminator removes undercoat VERY slowly, as in hardly at all. My curry comb was one-third the price and takes out undercoat about five times faster. My advice is to save a lot of money and time with a curry comb and slicker brush."
1,IF YOU LIKE BALD CATS...,"I got the medium size Furminator for my cats after reading and researching the reviews. I used it and was impressed with all the fur that came out. Then I noticed that my cat looked somewhat bleached and realized that his coat was thinned out. he looks like one of those older ladies that tints her hair apricot but you can see the white roots below. My beautiful black cat now has a gray area on his flank where the fur is noticably thinner and rough from having the top fur removed. The Furminator doesn't just remove dead hair, it generates more by breaking off the ""good"" fur. And the fur flies all over the place, sticks to the wall and the rug in puffy tuffs. I was happy with it at first but now I'm going to return it. My poor cat-boys' coats look patchy, dull and worse than before."
5,just buy it,"Best brush ever, not only does it remove about 10 times as much hair as the average brush, but it also cleans up really easy. For those of us who have spent countless hours of our lives picking away at our dogs hair brushes this is a god sent. We have a 70# dutch partridge dog (like a large springer spaniel) and use the Medium brush."
4,works well,I have 2 cats and 2 dogs with all fur types except curly represented. It works well on all of them and they all like it. More efficient than regular brushes but hair gets everywhere.
5,it really works.,I have 2 german shepherds and we all know how they shed. Since I have been using the furminator the shedding has decreased.
5,Great,"We have a Boxer,and we take him to the groomers, but in between appointments you would pet him and the fur would fly. We use the Furminator 1 or 2 times a week, takes only a few minutes, and we now can wear black clothing again in the house. It is GREAT............."
3,"sturdy, but .......","I got a great deal here at Amazon on my Furminator. Were it not for that, I'd be embarassed about the rip-off after falling for all the hype. I'm sure it's a matter of dog breed, time of year, something, but it's not working like the vids for me and my dog, an Aussie. The fur floating thru our home and landing everywere is only a little better. His coat looks better, but I had expected to get hands full of fur from him and I really have to work at it. It works pretty much like my old hair brush that I had been using.Wish it was better.If you can get a great deal, like me, I guess it's worth a try. DO NOT pay full price! I won't buy another one before I try something else."
5,It really works!,"The only thing wrong about our Labrador retriever is her shedding. The Furminator has eliminated that problem. By using it once a week, we don't notice fur on the floors anymore. We highly recommend it. It's easy to use and Molly enjoys being ""combed""."
5,wow,"i have a yellow lab with very thick hair. i am glad i got the largest size comb. it takes less strokes. it certainly took a lot of the hair off. not sure if from the under coat or not, but i could easily make a big pile of dog hair."
5,A GOD SEND!,"I love this thing! My cats look like they lost 10 pounds each with all the hair they lost. I've tried almost all the brushes out there before finding this one, and was so annoyed at how poorly they reduced shedding. I even used to get my my maine coon cat shaved in the summer because I would go crazy with all the hair he would still lose despite the brushing.But since I've found the furminator, the hair has almost vanished. My cats also love it: they are purring and very happy when they get brushed, my maine coon won't have to look like a plucked chicken in the summertime anymore, and I have WAY less hair clean up. Everybody wins!"
2,Unique brush without much benefit,"I purchased this brush after looking at the unique brush blade. It was different from my current pet brush, so I decided to try it out. I thought this is a new technology that can get rid of pet hair better than before. I am very disappointed after 2 weeks of usage.Pros: It gets hair out of your cats and dogs. But compared to a 5 dollar brush from Petsmart, it works about the same.Cons: Usually my cat loves being brushed, but he does not like it when I use the furminator. I believe it scratches him too hard.The Furnimator does not contain hairs in the brush. Hair will be left on the pet, so you have to grab all the hair with your hands. Other brushes collect hairs inside, which makes it easy to clean up. Furminator DOES NOT collect hair, which makes it HARD to clean up afterwards.If you have a spare 30 dollars and want to try it out, fine, but I prefer my 5 dollar brush from petsmart over the Furminator."
5,Furminator,Our older cat was throwing up everyday. The vet said there was nothing wrong with her. We tried furball food and that helped a little but she kept throwing up and losing weight at a dangerous rate. We got the furminator about 4 weeks ago and she has not thrown up since and she is putting on weight.I think the furminator saved her life!
5,Fur be gone,Best unit on the market. Get this if you dont have one. Gone thruogh 3 already. Best product out there.
5,Great!,"We rescued our Shepherd mix 2 months ago, she is full grown and was shedding so much I didn't think we wuld be able to keep her; I keep my house extremely clean so dog hair wasn't fitting with me. I took her to the groomer, they did their thing and it cost me $80.00. I asked what they use for hair and they said the Furminator. Bought it on Amazon for less than $30.00, I love it, she loves it and it does an awesome job, pet hair problem taken care of! Great service and price from Amazon!"
5,Works great!,"We have a beagle that sheds everywhere all the time. We got the Furminator from our veterinarian and it's helped tremendously. I was utterly shocked by how much fur came off him the first time we used it. It's like we brushed an entire other dog off his coat! While he still sheds, it has helped very, very much. Now I can vacuum every few days instead of twice a day (whewh!). I highly recommend this to anyone who's dog has a shedding problem. Plus, the dog seems to go into brushing-bliss when we use it on him, getting that ""ooo, that feels good"" expression. Pretty comical, and it makes using the Furminator an altogether pleasant experience."
4,Who knew???,"Wow! Who knew so much shed/under coat could come off of my dog! I have a 60 lb black lab who is constantly shedding all over the house. After using the FURminator a few times a week there is much less hair around the house. I did buy the shampoo to go with the brush, but it doesn't seem like the shampoo does too much. I get the same result whether or not I shampoo her first. Still, I'm very happy with this product. The only thing she doesn't like is brushing on the tail (but I seem to always get a TON of shed off of her tail, so I just give her an extra treat afterwards!:-)Highly recommended to anyone with a dog/cat that sheds!!"
2,It is no miracle - manage your expectations.,"Maybe I am disappointed because my expectations were too high. I really thought this was going to solve at least 90% of the pet hear issue if not all of it. I have short hair cat with medium to high shedding volume and she enjoys the brush and sure it gets chunks of hear out like the pictures show and like every one says. However, this does not reduce shedding all that much! It just makes her fur feel really thin but as I pet her after that, I see those hairs flying out all over again. I supposed it does REDUCE the shedding somewhat, maybe 20-30% at most for a few days after the use.. but that is about it. I was really expecting more from this thing because of all the raving reviews."
4,Furminator vs. Sheltie,"Wow! I couldn't believe how much hair I was able to remove. I was enjoying it so much, she got a little impatient with me. All I could see was all that hair coming off that I WOULDN'T be finding on the floor or the furniture later! I highly recommend this product and buying it at Amazon.com saved me significantly over what the vet was going to charge."
3,OK for short hairs-didn't work on my Maine Coon,"I imagine that this product would work well for a short haired cat, so I'm sending it to my mother to see how it works on her domestic short hair and medium haired kitties. My Maine Coon's fur was far too long for it to trap more than a tiny bit of hair. A professional shedding blade or even a steel curry comb (used for horses) works far better on him. My other two cats are Turkish Angoras and they don't have an undercoat to shed, so testing possibilities were limited. Maine Coon,Norwegian and Siberian forest cat owners (or equivalents)-you might want to pass this one by."
5,Great value on the FURminator,Delivery was quick and accurate. The product arrived exactly as described. I highly recommend this product and seller.
5,Great Dog Deshedding Tool,This deshedding tool works great and just pulls the hair out. I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Removes ridiculous amounts of hair; dog seems to like it,"The amount of hair removed by this tool from my German Shepherd is astounding. I could probably make a sweater for myself every month from the hair that comes off of her. Her hair feels smoother and softer after I'm done Furminating, which is nice, but she looks the same. She's also very cooperative whenever I Furminate her (unlike when I try to brush her teeth... very uncooperative) which leads me to believe that she enjoys it. My Furminator is a year old now, and is as durable and sturdy now as it was when it was new. Highly recommend."
5,Get this Version!!,"I bought this after the newer version came out so it was a GREAT deal. These tools are expensive and for good reason!!! We have a puppy with very short hair (less than 1/2"" long) and it has reduced her shedding and we've gotten out some of the ""fluff"" undercoat from the pictures. She is generally a little antsy to be brushed, but doesn't seem to have any problem with this. She was not a huge shedder to begin with but this reduced the amount significantly. We've used it four times (usually sometime shortly after her weekly bath as recommended) and it is just wonderful. I tried several other de-shedding products, none of them has been as helpful as this!"
3,FURminator Large,"Although the FURminator was really effective at removing hair from my dog, she still sheds constantly and I feel like it really did not cut down on any shedding."
4,Furminator a winner,"The great thing about the Furminator for me is that it keeps the fur compacted on the end of the tool, so it is easy to remove and dispose of (I do not have the self-cleaning head). A brush requires constant cleaning out and the shedder I was using let the loose fur fly everywhere. So, although I am not sure the Furminator actually removes more fur than other means, it is much more convenient and less messy--so I brush more."
5,this thing is amazing,"If you have ANY kind of animal that sheds, this is just the perfect tool for getting the fine, down hairs. It is amazing what this thing pulls up!!!!"
5,great product,this comb is great! works very well and the dog likes being combed with it. It has cut down on the dog hair on furniture and in the vacum drasticly. So glad i purchased.
4,Seems to do the job,"The brush doesn't get caught up in tangles, a good thing because that freaks out the older dog (a rather mellow German shepherd mix). Not that he'll sit patiently through the process, but he doesn't strain to escape, either, as he has with other brushes. The younger one, an Australian kelpie (never heard of it until I rescued her) totally loves being brushed. She'll stand at attention enjoying every moment. I don't know, she's spayed, but maybe this does it for her. Anyway, after three weeks of almost-daily use, their coats are noticeably thinner. They still are shedding, so it's no cure-all. But it is an improvement. I still find it hard to swallow, however, that any brush is worth this much. Your call."
5,Great deshedding Tool,"Wow! This product works great. I have the Yellow deShedding Tool 2.6"" and it is wonderful. Friends told me about it and said I should give it a try on my 2 year old Corgie. What a difference this has made. Not as much hair on my hardwood floors and she looks great. I bought on Amazon at a fair price. Worth every penny. If you try it you will love it."
5,Best dog brush ever,"I have 2 dogs that shed heavily. One is a lab mix and the other a terrier mix. The Furminator doesn't work at all on my short haired terrier, but it works amazingly on the lab. I've NEVER seen a brush that takes hair off a dog so efficiently. This is also the only brush I've ever had that my dog likes, she runs away from every other brush I've ever owned.The only strike is that you continually have to pull the hair off the brush. In my opinion, this is a small price to pay for the amount of hair you'll get off your dog!!!"
4,Excellent Grooming Tool,"With two large labrador retrievers roaming around, dog hair is a constant problem in our house. Although my last de-shedding tool was effective, it rarely got used because it took forever just to groom one dog and its comb-like shape put a lot of tension on my wrist. I was suprised at how much easier I could get the job done with the FURminator. The FURminator's handle is designed to be comfortable for the user, and the blade grabs a large amount of loose undercoat with each swipe. I still think the retail price of $40 is ridiculous (this is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5), but I opted to give it a try when I saw Amazon's sale price of $25 with free ""super saver"" delivery. I'm glad I did."
5,love this deshedding tool,"FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch EdgeI got this tool in the mail today! I used it on my cats first, I could not belive how much hair came off my 3 cats, 1 of wish is very long hair. Then I have 4 horses, so, I tryed on them. This is the best deshedding tool I have ever used on horses!! I have used alot of other tools, but this is byfar the best! The horses loved it. This time of the year, the horses start shedding there winter hair off and I hate to do it, cause it a alot of work, but today I enjoyed it, also my 2 dogs loved it too! I would recommand this tool for everybody that has horses,cats & dogs. This is also a great price,won't find it any cheaper!!"
5,I have enough hair to create another Lab,"Seriously, it works amazingly, just make sure you do it outside.Great tool to help remove hair, however I still can't ever seem to get it all gone for longer than a day."
5,"2 words, It works!","This brush really works. I have a 16 month old shiba inu and when I brushed him with a regular brush I got nothing however If I held him my shirt would have hair all over it. After brushing him out with the furminator I was realy shocked at how great it worked, and his coat felt so great. I wish I would have had one of these brushes growing up with my pomeranian. It would take me hours to brush him out, it would have taken me maybe 10 minutes top with this brush. The price is a little steep but its worth it if your considering buying it but want to make sure it works."
5,Fantastic FURminator !,This is absolutely the very BEST BRUSH for long haired cats and boy I have tried everything! It really gets big matts out. I would recommend you petting while you are working the brush. This is what keeps Fluffy happy and still for me.
4,Furminator 4 inch,This is an excellent product and works very well.My cat starts purring as soon as I start using it.I am not sure about smaller sizes.
5,"Furminator, terrific deshedding tool",The FURminator works wonderfully on my female Sheltie. I have only used it twice and have been very happy with each use. It really gets rid of the undercoat and has cut down on a great deal of shedding. I feel it will really help her to be quite comfortable this summer and help to keep the floating hair down to a minimum. I do wish the price had been lower but I had heard good reviews on the product so I was willing to spend the money.
5,I Can't Stop FURminatin',I wasn't sure this was going to work on my English Setter because he's not a double-coated dog. I got an amazing amount of hair off of him AND off my cat. The freaky thing is that he LETS me Furminate him whereas he always hated every brush I ever tried on him.I'm ready to go out and find other animals to FURminate. This thing is like crack for both people and dogs!
4,Great Product,This is a great tool for combating shedding and keep your house less furry! My dog sheds all year round and with this tool I believe that there is less floating hair around the house. I have tried slicker type brushes and my dog hates them because it pulls his fur so he tries to run away which makes it impossible for me to brush him entirely. With the FURminator it doesn't seem to pull the tangles and makes it easier for me to finish. I love it! Definately recommend it for those hard to brush dogs.
5,Best Deshedding tool!,I love the FURminaror and it works very well! I have 2 French bulldogs which have very short coats and this product works wonders! Great price and the free Deshedding shampoo is fantastic!
5,A FURminator for our Labrador Retriever,We have bought a number of brushes and combs with the idea of thinning the fur of our Yellow Lab. This is by far the best device we've had. It pulls handfuls of hair from him and has really kept the shedding problem under control.I've told out Vet about how well this works and she told me that she's been using it on her own dogs.
5,Best I've owned,A fantastic product that pays for itself. It worked great and it was a reasonable cost. My cat took only a day to get used to it and now she looks forward to her brushings.
3,Meh,"I got this for my super fuzzball long hair cat. The cat didn't mind being brushed with it, but honestly, I wasn't that impressed. I actually did better with a fully silicone rubber style brush. It did work, but not to the extent I was hoping."
4,removes an amazing amount of fur,"This does exactly as advertised. The downside is removing the hair from the brush after only one brush, but that is a result of it working so well. I just about filled a trashcan with all of the fur removed!"
5,incredible,"I must say I had heard all the hype, but was a bit skeptical. But then I tried the furminator, and was amazed at how well it removes the fur. I now have enough to build another dog!!"
4,Furminator is quick and easy,"The Furminator is a quick and easy version of a rake (and comb). Our dog really doesn't like either one but the Furminator takes less time so that's a plus. I can be a little more thorough with the rake and comb but it's great to have the Furminator on hand and on Amazon, the price was right!"
5,Does everything it promises,This tool is definitely worth the purchase. It works perfectly. Does not hurt our dog. And removes a ton of hair - I am 100% satisfied.
5,Furminator is great,I have used the Furminator on my two dogs and one cat. It works fabulously. It works so well that you would be wise to use it in an open area that you don't mind fur flying around or using it outside is even better. It does a great job of deshedding. So glad I tried it.
5,very good product,"i have used several brushes on my healers without good results--this product is wonderful--gets the undercoat, the dander and tons of loose hair that would have wound up in my house"
5,"Gentle, effective grooming","The FURminator is the first de-shedding tool my smooth-coated terrier hasn't rejected! Short of the softest brush, he wouldn't let me come near him with any of the usual wire brushes, because they all irritated his sensitive skin. Now he rolls over and all but begs me to ""de-thatch"" his coat. He's looking good, and because I can thoroughly remove all the dead undercoat, his skin is healthier and he doesn't shed nearly as much. Great product!"
5,AWESOME TOOL,This is one product that works as good as manufacturer claims!If you have pets BUY ONE. Even on short haired animals this works great.
5,Works well,"I have seen this product at much higher prices. Seems like when I use it with some consistency the amount of furry tumbleweeds all over the house decrease and believe me, that's a good thing."
5,Wonderful!,"A very good little tool here, and the blades don't cut the fur which is nice. The blades may look intimidating but they are really very soft. My two cats like being bruished with it very much, but won't tolerate it for too long of a period so I have to do it little by litte. In the litte chunks of time I do brush them, a lot of fur comes out! Just a warning, I suggest you do this outside. I experienced quite a 'furricane' when I used it the first time."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I have two Golden Retrievers and the FURminator is worth every penny. After brushing them with the FURminator the shedding and extra hair is basically gone. Plus, they seem to love it. I've seen the FURminator (large size) selling for $60 in some pet stores and thus the price at Amazon.com is very good. If you've got a dog that sheds, trust me, you will not regret getting the FURminator.."
5,You need one!,Living in AZ dogs begin their annual shed aboutMay. I ordered the Furminator for my two dogsand am happily and gratefully satisfied. I tryto deshedd them at least every other day. Thistool allows you to get the finer fuzz under thefurr. Great tool for dog owners and I hear catowners as well.
5,the very best,"i have multiple cats, this item is wonderful, you cannot believe how much fur it removes from the cats and they love it, their coats look so much better after using it, anyone who has a cat should have this, it is the best thing i have ever bought for my cats."
5,Furminator,This is the greatest grooming tool ever!! Anyone who has a lab knowshow they shed. I have reduced vacuming by half!
5,The Mother of all Brushes!,"I was able to pick this up for $32 last fall from Amazon.com, and it was some of the best money I ever spent. There are two Labs in our family. One has fairly long fur for a Lab and sheds pretty much constantly. The other sheds like mad for a few weeks a couple times a year. Slicker brushes just weren't up to the task.I saw a gadget on TV (not the furminator) and decided to see if I could find something that worked. After reading poor reviews of said gadget, someone recommended the furminator. I initially balked at the price. That much for a brush? Really? But the reviews were stellar so I decided to give it a go.Simply put: best pet grooming product ever! The furminator pulls out so much loose fur it's amazing! And they like it because they don't have to be brushed so often with a harsh wire brush. win-win! If you have a dog that sheds, you need to have this item. Without a doubt."
3,Furminator,The furminator does remove a lot of hair but you have to be careful not to press too hard or else it will catch the pup's skin and cause tiny cuts. Then you have to wait until the scabs heal because the furminator will keep opening the wound.
5,Excellent Grooming Tool,"The Furminator works very well to remove excess hair from our Golden Doodle. He has a very thick coat and a high matabolism. The combination makes him hot, especially in warmer weather. Regular hair cuts plus the Furminator help solve the problem - plus it reduces the amount of stray dog hair around the house. He seems to tolerate the Furminator much - much better than any of the other methods we've previously tried to remove excess hair. Recommend this product. It works great!"
3,Grooming dogs,This product may be great for some breeds but was not the best for my English Cockers.I find the Mars Coat King to be a better all around product.
3,not as good as the hype,I bought this as a gift for a friend who had read the hype. She tried it on her golden retriever and got less hair out than she did with a rake. She was very disappointed.
2,"Well, it worked...","I tried one out (I think the medium size) on my dog at the dog run when another dog owner brought it to the run.I tried it out on two dogs, and it seemed to do a pretty good job, but it wasn't better than my $7 de-shedder that I got at my local pet store.When I told the dog owner that I had a $7 de-shedding tool that worked just as well as the Furminator, she was not surprised... actually, she was pretty disgusted!"
3,not for bealges,Not bad. Probably for dogs with longer hair like retrievers. I have 2 beagles that shed a lot and this product really didn't make a difference.
3,Nice Product,I use this on my greyhound and mixed bread dog. This product works pretty good but has yet to prevent the dogs from shedding as stated. The dogs do seem to enjoy getting Furminated...
5,amazing brush,it is nice to finally have a brush that allows you to see the amount of fur that comes off while you're brushing. the brush i had prior would take fur off but there was almost no way of removing the hair from the brush. now i can physically see exactly how much comes off!
5,The FURminator is a must for cat owners!,"I just recently purchased a FURminator to use on my cat (who loves to be combed). Even though she gets regular combing, the first time I used this product on her I combed out a relatively large pile of fur - and she loved it. The FURminator removes hair from the under layers that a regular cat comb/brush does not seem to remove. I heartily recommend it to any cat owner. BTW, my husband is using it regularly on our Airedale.FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge"
4,"Good, little $$$","Works ok on my lab, gets hair out but still seems spendy. I feel like it would work better on long hair dogs."
5,Great Comb,"I have owned several combs for both my dog and cats and this is by far the best. My dog is a mix of Australian Sheppard, Chow and Lab with mostly Chow fur. This comb goes through it with ease and doesn't pull. It does produce static with her hair but that is the only issue I have found. My cats just love it too. I bring out the comb and they all line up for their turn. Great product! I highly recommend it."
4,amazing,The furminator came quickly. We were amazed at how much fur came off our chocolate lab. I think he felt much better too
5,Buy it and vacuum less,"Like all the other reviews that I have read on this product, it is the best! Massive amounts of hair came off my Australian Sheperds and much, much less on the floor. I have already recommended it to several friends who have purchased it and love it also. A great buy!"
4,Furinator - does the job,I have a Shiba Inu who blows his coat twice year. Each day I can have a new dog in fur all over the floor but this device just rakes is all into a smaller pile and makes life less fuzzy. Good product!
4,FURminator,"This product worked great! I was amazed at how much fur I got from a Chihuahua-MinPin. It's not a sharp tool, but be sure to be gentle. My dog used to love being brushed, but with the FURminator sometimes seems a little uncomfortable when I brush him."
1,Broken after 6 months,"Before it was broken, it worked very well. I probably used it every 1-2 weeks for my German Shepherd. But it broke when I was using after about 6 months of use. The handle is broken inside the rubber cover. I tried to contact the seller to find out whether it carries any warranty, no response!"
1,FURminator Large Yellos deShedding Tool,"It does get hair off, but, it seems about the same as a regular priced dog brush. I have two Australian Shepherds, maybe it works better with other types of dogs. I should've sent it back, but, I think I ran out of time."
1,Akita owners-- stay away!,We have 2 Akitas and they shed A LOT!! We had heard about the furminator from neighbors and decided to try it. We brush our dogs once a week with this and at first it really helped minimize the fur in our place. There are little blades in this and it seemed to get out a lot of hair. I am changing the review because we noticed our dogs coats looking frizzed out and not shiny anymore. We feed out dogs all natural Blue Buffalo and NO table food. We figured this brush was pulling out too much with all the small sharp little blades. We were right. We haven't used this brush and for the past 9 months or so have been using a plain brush...1 in long metal spaced .5in apart or so and small metal maybe .25 in long between. no cutting blades. Still works. In a couple months our dogs got their shiny coats back and everything has been fine. I know this has great reviews but if you have an Akita--stay away!
4,Deshedding tool works well.,The Furminator tool works well for both my cat and dog. thanks for the item! It does not work as well on my dog with very short hair. I think a larger tool might have worked better.
4,my dogs love it! I love it!,"They sit down in front of me ready to be brushed when they see it. It brushed a whole lot of the fur out of both my dogs but they still shed, just not nearly as bad. It works better on my long haired dog though. I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Amazing,"This item is absolutely amazing.I am a sucker for buying ""stuff"". So when I purchased the furminator,I expected a gadget of sorts.Much to my surprise..this thing turned out to be absolutely amazing. I adopted a rescue dog,so it's been trial&error. I've never owned a long-haired dog and after vacuuming every other day,I felt like returning my beloved rescue dog. Being 60yrs.and disabled w/fused back,I didn't know how long my back could handle the cleaning!!!After buying The Furminator...my life took on a new meaning.I was no longer a slave to shedding hair.I'm a born-again Furminator FAN."
5,that's a lot of fur!,"I can't believe how much fur this pulls off the animals. We are using it for a medium-haired cat and for our border collie, and it is great on both of them. They wont let us brush them completely so they still shed some, but this product significantly reduces the amount of shedding. I highly recommend it."
5,gotta have it!,"My dog loves getting brushed by this FURmintator! He will sit there all day letting me brush him. Not to mention, the hair that comes off and onto the brush is AMAZING! So worth it!"
3,So so,"I expected it to be larger and with the extremely small teeth, it's difficult to grab onto fur. Maybe larger sizes would be better? I'm sure it works well for others but not me."
5,Best Tool for Getting Rid of Shedding Hair!!!!,"Wow! I LOVE the furminator!!! My dog is a black lab/collie mix, and every year around shedding season she gets huge tangled/matted chunks of hair that are really tough to get out. However, the furminator did the trick!! My dog didn't seem to mind it at all, and was very patient with me while I got all the tangled mess out. AND, after the old hair was removed, she was soooo soft and shiny. I will never use ANY other brush!!!"
5,Super Item - a must have for pet owners!!,"I have two, long-haired cats who shed profusely most of the year. I hesitated because of the expense, but bought my first Furminator in the hope that if it did half of what the manufacturer claimed, it would be worth the price. An 80% reduction in shedding for these two cats would be miraculous! WOW! This product far exceeded my expectations, lived up to its name and drastically reduced the shedding.I bought this larger Furminator for my daughter - although her dog is a short haired, Golden Retriever his shedding was the same or worse than my cats. Needless to say, Furminator saved the day - and the constant need to vacuum, remove hair from the furniture, etc. The best part is that it's easy to use and the animals love it! I highly recommend this product."
1,Not so great...,"Ok, so I've never written a review on ANYTHING before...this is my first. We have a 6 month old boxer pup and have used the Furminator for a few weeks now...I gave it an honest shot and now I'm done! It makes my pups coat look thinner and unhealthy (looks like its making gaps in the coat)...it actually broke the skin in one place making it bleed a little. And he hasn't enjoyed it from day one. And he still sheds just as much as he did before use. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,IT CUT MY DOG!,"I went to the groomer and you think if a groomer uses this tool it has to be good. That's defintely not the case! After checking my dog the next day we noticed he had scabs all over his body from where the groomer used the tool. I have a rottweiler and he normally has lots of energy and loves going for car rides. He was in so much pain he layed on the couch and didn't move or eat. I had to take him to the vet and the vet reported the groomer. He needs to take antibiotics and this is so ridiculous because no dog should have to go through that because they shed. Dogs shed! It's what they do. If you don't like don't get a dog that sheds. We only brought him in to get groomed to get his nails clipped and ears trimmed and anal glands drained and they did this to him, or shall I say the FURminator did this to him!"
2,goldendoodle,"I bought this thinking it would help my girl, who has an absolutely beautiful coat, thick but very much like human hair. I used it once and will never use it again. It took out a huge mass of hair, not just her undercoat either."
1,Fake FURminator? Cloned in China?,"I got mine here at Amazon and it didn't even come in the hard plastic packaging, just a plastic bag... I think it's a fake, it certainly doesn't work like the company advertised. My dog hates it, and he's normally fine around grooming tools. This is the worst grooming tool ever invented."
1,Just a fine tooth comb.,"I was excited about this tool and thought I would save some money on grooming costs. This tool is nothing more than a fine tooth comb. I removes no more hair the a normal brush, perhaps less. I thought about returning it and then thought that maybe it would be good for finding ticks and flees. Don't waste your money on this rip-off."
2,Not what it's hyped up to be,"Because of the advertising and even a recommendation from a friend, I was expecting the Furminator to be something really different and super effective. It does work, but not any better than other rakes I have used over the years, and not as well as some. Not worth the price!"
1,Not worth the time or money,"What a total waste, my cats and one dog like their brushings but not with this thing, this hurts their skin.I have to hide it in my hand to do a few strokes with one cat, and then I may still get a hiss or two. Now they won't let me brush them at all.This is very klunky and hard, it has sharp edges and it is hard NOT to hurt your pet."
2,it hurts!,"This item is great at pulling out loose hair, but it also pulls at other hairs from the root. I have to say that I have 6 cats and they did not like it. It causes them pain so I will not use the item again."
5,Great Grooming Tool/Great Value,"I was skeptical that the FURminator would be as effective as the commercials say it is. I was also appalled at its price. However, when I saw it for half the (Petsmart) price on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.We have three golden retrievers and this tool rocks! While it doesn't cut brushing time down any, it gets probably three times more hair off of the dogs. I am so pleased that the FURminator does what it says it will do! I've been able to get boatloads of hair off the dogs, and I know they are so much more comfortable in this summer heat."
4,FURmination Nation,"I am thrilled with the way my FURminator performs! I have 5 medium-to-large dogs, amd 4 indoor cats. I live in the mid-south and this time of year my animals shed like you wouldn't believe! The FURminator removes more hair in one stroke than any other brush/comb I have used...and I have used MANY in an effort to cut down on grooming time and frequency. The ""medium"" size works well on both dogs & cats. I am telling all my friends about this marvelous tool. Buy one. You will not regret it!"
4,Great job!,"I have a very hairy German Shepherd and this tool does an amazing job of getting tons of hair out. It takes a few times but I do notice less shedding in the house. She enjoys it when I do brush her, like a massage. I highly recommend this especially at Amazons great price!"
3,Furminators,"Ordered this for my golden retriever. It does help with shedding, however, not as great as I had expected. I will not be returning this item as it's quality is good and I expect it will hold up for a long time. However, after calling some groomers in town, I had additionally purchased a Mars Coat King stripper with more superb results."
3,No match for my cat's shedding,"I had high hopes when looking at the adds and certain reviews for this deshedding treatment. My Turkish Angora cat sheds a lot, and I was excited the first time I used the product set--the amount of fur that was removed during the shampooing and treatment was impressive, as was the additional hair removed with the brush when she was dry. I could have easily created one of those pictures that the company offers, with the groomed pet surrounded by huge amounts of removed fur.However, it did nothing to curb shedding afterwards. She still sheds as much as ever, and I found the smell from the conditioner to be very strong. Perhaps if I keep using the treatment it will make more of a difference, but I was initially disappointed."
5,The best grooming tool I have ever purchased,"I have a 70-lb German Shepherd who, like all dogs in her breed, sheds so much that within a month there would be so much fur you could use it to stuff a pillow. We vacuum once or twice every day but there are still tufts of fur rolling around the house like tumbleweeds.I bought the medium-sized brush. It is a good size for her. Within five strokes through her coat, I had gotten enough fur to completely fill a normal slicker brush. Try to use this outside (and don't wear anything nice) because the fur will stick to everything. I imagine it feels good for the dog, because mine stood there the entire time- even though she has the attention span of a four-year old human.This tool is amazing!"
3,Works well,"Furminator works well, not sure its as good as the manufacturer would lead us to believe. I have a golden retriever that is starting to shed for the season. I have previously used a traditional undercoat rake. The furminator is approximately 20% better, but 250% more expensive. So...... to do it all over. I would probably stick with the undercoat rake and keep the dollars in my pocket.One thing to say for Amazon though..... $30 less than my local bigbox pet store!!!!"
5,FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool,Amazing!!! The product works so well and the beast loves it! bring it to the dog park and before long 2-3 people are asking me where they can get one and AMAZON gives you great value for your dollar!
4,"Our cat, Sheba, loves it","From the first time that we tried the furminator, our cat responded and we got a small box full of fur that would've been on us or on furniture or floors.Now, whenever we sit on the floor with the furminator tool, Sheba comes running over for her furminator 'treatment', rolls over for her tummy to be done. She stays there until we are finished. We were and continue to be amazed."
3,Not Sold on it yet,"I got this tool on recommendation from a friend who really liked it. It does get a lot of hair off and is easier to use than a regular brush. However, my German Shepherd/Black Lab mix seems to end up shedding more afterwards. She sheds two ways, fur balls and what I call needle droppings (individual hairs). The balls of fur have gotten better, but she's now shedding more individual hairs everywhere than ever before. I don't know if this is just a coincidence or if it's because of this tool. I've been using this for several weeks now and so far it hasn't gotten any better. I'm still willing to give it more time. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Although, how many ways can you brush a dog?"
4,Excellent de-shedding tool!,"We purchased the FURminator after talking with a friend about it and are very happy with it. It is amazing how it lifts the undercoat away - and how much comes out every time! Maybe I don't have the process down yet, but I have had to use it several times in the last month - unlike the description that says it stops shedding for months. But, all in all we are very pleased with it and would recommend it to others."
2,It's OK,"This ""brush"" is OK. My sister in law bought this brush at a local sporting goods store for $70 and has just raved about it. So, finding it on Amazon for $30 with free shipping - I jumped on it. We both live on farms and have large dogs that shed LOTS. I dont think it does any better than our regular dog brush. You have to be careful not to rub the skin raw - especially in those areas that dont have much hair. I wish I would have saved my money and just used the brush I already have. It's not like it doesnt take the hair out, but so does a $5 brush from WalMart - and they dont usually leave a skin burn.."
4,Best brush I've ever used,"I'd give this 5 stars, but it's very heavy for it's size and so often I feel like I'm brushing too hard. We have a doberman and a greyhound (both large dogs with short hair) and got the 4-inch brush. Due to the Furminator's weight and our dogs' bones that jut out, I think the medium size would have been better - i.e., more maneuverable and a with a lighter, more comfortable touch. However, this brush is the only one that has ever actually cut down (considerably!) on the amount of dog hair that gets sprinkled all over our floor, and it seems to make their coats shinier and cleaner, too. I brush them every other day. They seem to like it; the greyhound actually follows me around when I have it.I would recommend this brush over any other for short-haired dogs, and I think we've tried them all. Now when are they going to make the magic pill that eliminates shedding altogether????"
3,It works great - but no better than a good brush from the pet store,"I purchased due to all the hype. However, compared to a similar styled brush (less than half the price) purchased at a local pet store, there was absolutely no difference in performance. So... I am going to chalk this one up to plain hype. It works - and it works well, but it gets 3/5 stars due to obscene price without any improvement. Buy it if the price won't hurt your pocketbook, but if it will, look for a brush with closely spaced, short metal bristles, and you will be fine."
5,Best deshedding tool,"I have a Golden Retriever that I used a shedding blade on. I then heard how good the Furminator worked and wanted to give it a try. It is by far the best deshedding tool I've ever used. It pulls out so much of the dead hair so fast, I get twice as much fur than I did with the shedding blade. My dog enjoys it also, I'm sure it feels good to lose all that fur. The only thing I can say that is annoying is how much static there is when the fur comes out. It's a definate must have for long haired dogs. I also use it on my cat who LOVES it too."
5,ANOTHER FULLY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first researched the ""Furminator"" it had 962 five-star reviews. I was desperate for a solution to my ""German-Shedder's"" fluff-balls floating all over the house. This was the answer to my problems! Make me #963 of satisfied customers. My dog's winter undercoat is almost fully removed and my house is much cleaner! I heartily recommend this product!"
5,Awesome,"This brush got TONS of hair off my cats the first time I used it. Still works great, getting a lot of hair off my cats. Cuts down on the amount of hair I have floating around the house too. Recommended!"
3,fur thinner comb,The product will work but it removes too much. I found that I could not use it on a cat that was being prepped for a cat show. It also seems to be overpriced even at the discount. I have it in my grooming kit for the stay at home felines. I breed long hair cats of the northern Forest line.
3,Furminator,This item is not worth the cost. A curry comb style brush you can purchase in the local pet store for less than half the price works just as well.
4,Does the job,"Unbelievable the amount of cat hair this tool collected on each of our cats. The little 8 pound cat absolutely loves it, the 20 pound cat not so much. I used the medium one on the 20 pound and maybe it worked too well as he now has a thinning spot on his backside. Would recommend using light pressure and sticking with the small one for cats. Overall great for cats, great for humans if you want to minimize fur on furniture."
1,"This product is a scam, don't buy the hype","The people that are rating this product at 4/5 stars need to step away from the bong. Yes it rakes off gobs of hair because you are actually shaving your dog, you are not removing loose hair. You won't realize this until you stripped away your dogs coat. Talk to groomers and they will tell you why they do not use this tool."
2,not what I expected,I have a 5lb long haired chihuahua. Bought furminator medium brush but with two times that I pass brush on her I already need to clean it.Was hoping for a nice size tool that would really do the job.I use this one and then use regular grooming brush as well.For me I found this rather pricey and am sorry to say not impressed at all.
3,furminator,works great but I have a part collie and it did not do well on his back end but he is shedding this time of year and the back end get pretty knotted.
3,"It DOES work, but manufacturer site makes it hard to pick right one...","It DOES work, but manufacturer site makes it hard to pick right one... We bought this one based on Furminator web site. It gets some fur out, but when we tried a different model with longer teeth we got twice as much. So we now have a useless one once we buy the correct one! The basic product is good though, as they get out a bunch of fur."
5,Wow,"Wow, that's all I have to say. I can't believe how much fur came off. I was skeptical of the advert picture showing the dog sitting next to a pile of hair ... until I saw my ""low-shed"" dog sitting next to a pile of hair."
2,Not the best tool for my Labrador,"I can't complain about the price or the transaction, but I expected better results based on the reviews. The teeth clog up with fur pretty fast, so you are constantly wiping the brush after every stroke. I have a ""Slicker brush"" that I bought at Tractor Supply for under six bucks that works way better & removes much more dog hair. My dog loves being brushed with it too."
5,DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS!,life saver! i brushed both my dogs and i swear i could form another dog with their fur alone! the customer pics aren't exaggerated!
4,furminator,good quality product lives up to it's claim but you would have to comb your animal constantliy to stop all shedding
3,its ok,Its better than most brushes but the hair flies all over the place. It did irritate my dogs skin but it worked well on the cat
4,i like it,buy it on amazon or online somewhere. the stores are double the price. i have a 60 pd dog and i bought the extra large one. its a little too big for him. I would go one size smaller just to manuver on his legs & belly area easier. It does the job. He yelps a little when i press too hard-it can hurt.
3,furminator use,"Good tool, a bit harsh for my dogs but works well if you don't have matted hair. have to do it in stages since they are not happy with it. However, others that are easier on them don't work as well.glad I bought it."
4,Great for long haired dogs,"This is one of the best grooming tools I have used on my dog, which is a Norwegian Elk Hound with a very thick coat. I have tried others and did not see the same results as I have had with the FURminator. The shedding hair in my house has been reduced over 50%. In the past I have had to sweep the house everyday to pick up Doogie's hair. Since I started using the Furminator I only clean up every 2-3 days. If you don't already own this tool, buy it now, but only if you have a long haired dog.I bought one of these for my girl friend to use on her German Shepherd and she said not only did her dog not like it, she said it did nothing to reduce the hair she found in the house.So, long, thick coat great. Long, not so thick, not so great. You decide."
4,Schools still out,"I've had German Shepherds for the last 40 years.So far the FURminator is the best,by far,of any tool I've used.However, the dogs shedding season is not here yet,and at that time it will have to prove itself."
5,Furminator Medium Yellow,if you have pets and don't have one of these(Get One) I love mine and I use it on my dog and my cat and love love it as well.I liked mine so much that I ordered my mother one for her doy and cat.great product
1,Not the real furminator,"This tool is not the real furminator. I have a small furminator that works wonders on my beagle's coat but wanted a larger size. I should have known by the price that this product is not the real thing. The bristle-prongs are much farther apart than on the furminator, so it grabs virtually no hair. Total waste of money. Also, it was shipped from China, so sending it back is probably more of a hassle than it is worth, since the tool was so inexpensive."
3,a great tool in the right hands,"This is a great tool if you use it as directed. It actually cuts the hair as well as pull out the loose hair. Do NOT Press down, otherwise the dogs skin turns into ground meat. As proven by my groomer's heavy hand."
5,WOW,I had no idea this would be so good! My cats let me use this all the time. What a difference it makes in their coats. You will see a big difference in shedding. I do recommend this to everyone!
4,A good tool,It works well on my dog. It can get the inner fur out. I didn't give it 5 stars because the price isn't reasonable.
4,Work great especially when you use it ;),"I have a Golden Retriever who has been shedding like mad since I decided not to spend $55.00 a month on her grooming and chose to do it myself. The problem was that I didn't have a professional dryer/tools to take care of all the excess shedding that comes after a bath. We're talking serious shedding here folks, like mutant dust bunnies you fear will take over...anyway, after your pup's coat is completely dry you can get just about all of the excess fur out before it lands on your bedding (or in my case my significant other's pillow), or your guests black pants (though any one who knows me & my pup should know that khaki is a sensible alternative). Do be careful though, as the directions say, be gentle & use serious caution or you could turn this product into a torture device. I've used it on our two cats as well, who consequentially are significantly depressed that there are no longer any mutant dust bunnies to attack..."
5,Saved $30 ordering it on line!!!,"How thrilled I was to receive my FURminator!! It is exactly the one I was going to purchase at my local chain pet store. But, online at Amazon, I was able to purchase it for over thirty dollars cheaper!!!"
1,Worst tool ever,"I gave mine away, I will not use it on my Bernese Mtn Dogs, as it actually cuts their skin."
5,The Best Tool Ever,I am very satisfied with this product. It helped me get rid of extensive shedding by my Golden Retriever Service Dog. No more big balls of hair on the carpet
2,It's a harsh tool.,I bought for a golden retriever and shepard and a white pyrenees. I really didn't work on my golden. I worked best on my mother Shepard however you can go to far. Hair everywhere and you could just keep brushing until the dog is bald. Not to say we would do that but we were never done. So becareful.
4,Doggie deshedding tool is necessarry for our dense but short haired dog.,"'Bought this to replace a lost one. Dog has shoart but thick hair, and it works well.Combs a lot of the under-hair as well as top coat of our ""forever shedding"" dog."
5,Boston Terrier,I bought this when it was on sale to give it a shot. I had read some reviews and my family had been telling me about how great they were. I have a Boston Terrier though so his hair is very short and I didn't think it would make that much difference.I was so wrong! This thing is so amazing. It immediately cut down the amount of hair we found in the house and on his beds while also making his coat very shiny. It seems like its a bit abrasive at first but he freaking loves this so it's obviously not hurting him. This is the first time in his life he has actually just rolled over to let me brush him without a fight.
3,Does the job,"The product and the price was excellent. I had gotten the Furminator for use with my rough collie. She is not a show dog & we live in Florida, so getting out the undercoat is a good thing. It did just a little bit better than the pin brush I am using and I had some concerns about breaking the hairs of her outer coat. It did much better with our German shepherd. Tons of hair are coming out as the lad sheds his undercoat."
5,throw up less,"If your cat is throwing up on a regular basis, brushing it with this brush will help end the constant purchasing of paper towels and fur on floor."
2,Misrepresented,"I received this item expecting identical performance to a previously purchased FURminator (minus the ejector feature). I was extremely disappointed. The slots in this deshedder blade are noticeably shallower than in the previously used model. I then noticed that Amazon indicates that there is a ""Newer Model"" available, which is identified as being for short-hair dogs. It occurred to me that Amazon failed to specify that the advertised model is designed for short coated dogs! It is misleadingly described as a ""FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with4-inch Edge."" No mention of hair length. I am requesting a return!"
5,Great product,"After reading the reviews on the Furminator and getting a verbal recommendation for it, I thought I would try it on my 75lb. German Shepherd. It worked wonders! She was shedding profusely (getting rid of her winter coat), and after 2 times of using the Furminator the shedding was greatly reduced. Her coat looked/looks shiny and beautiful, too! I would highly recommend this product."
5,FURminator,"As a volunteer with the Humane Society, I see this tool work like magic on every type of coat and every temperament of animal. The hairiest cats and antsy-est dogs will all sit to be brushed for this. Like another review said, it's not for removing burrs or mats (you'll need to cut those out first), but to remove extra fur and cut shedding like nobody's business, this is the perfect tool. I know some people who say that it looks a little industrial, but as long as you use it like any other brush - no extra pushing or anything - most pets will sit for it, if not enjoy it. I got it for my own Beagle/Sheltie mix and in the summer months she sheds so much less and she looks so shiny after using it."
5,Best dog comb ever!,"This thing cleaned up my dog's coat in 3 sessions. She's a Chow-German Shepherd mix, and her coat has never looked better, plus the house is easier to clean!"
5,FUR EVERYWHERE,The Furminator deshedding tool really does work but be prepaired to have cat hair everywhere. My cats like it and it's very easy to use.
5,Furminator,This is a GREAT product! You will literally be amazed at the amount of hair you will get off your dog. Use fast strokes to get the most benefit. There are vids on the net that will give you a good idea of how to get the most from your Furminator. This is a must buy for pet owners.
5,Grooms the Furry Beastie,"The FURminator is the best deshedding tool that I have ever seen or used. My big Maine Coon cat changed from a prehistoric looking fur creature to a coiffed feline sophisticate in one five minute deshedding session. When the mistress is inside now, there is much less fur in the air and furniture. I do worry that her ego will become larger as she learns that she is now even more beautiful and pettable. The 2.6 edge FURminator is perfect for furry beasties over 12 pounds."
4,Amazing for double-coated dogs,"I have used a lot of dog shedding brushes--teflon combs, shedding blades, and a cheaper version of this--and, as good as some of them are on my dog's coat, none of them work anything like the Furminator. The owner of the self-service dog wash let me borrow his one day, and I was hooked. I can brush my corgi once a week or so and pull out more hair than I thought possible. His coat looks much better, as does my house. It's very expensive (my only reason for the 4-star rating rather than 5), but for me, it was definitely worth it."
5,Great!,Someone had been recommending this FURminator for months and months. I thought I had enough brushes and combs. Wrong! It's as wonderful as she said it is. I have an Akita with thick fur and a nice undercoat. Akitas shed and this seems to be the easiest to clean and most effective tool I have ever used on a dog.
4,FURminator,"I purchased the Furminator for our aging cat with digestive track problems due to hairballs, etc. In the past we've used various brushes to remove her hair. Furminator does a good job of removing hair from her, and she does enjoy it, unlike a lot of the brushes we've used in the past. The only negative is that the furminator gets ""filled"" very quickly and needs frequent cleaning during a brushing session. We use it about 1-2 times per week, however, for major hair removal, we've been using an electric hair clipper - it doesn't require stopping for cleaning, although the cat does get bothered by the buzzing noise a few minutes into it.Overall, I would recommend it for a small dog or a cat"
4,"Never brushed before, godsent!","I wish I found this product earlier! My dog is a lab mix, with very fine straight hair. She has terrible shedding problems when she is patted or if she is inquisitive about something. I never thought a brush would work since her hair is fairly straight and fine. I WAS WRONG! This FURMINATOR never stops finding hair to brush. On Lucy, most of her loose hair is towards her rear, I'm not sure why. So that's where I brush her the most. When you see a big glob of hair you know its working.The only improvement I can attest to, is if they added some sort of hair collector, so I wouldn't have to pull the hair off the brush after every swipe. After I pull the hair and let it go into the wind, my dog tries to catch it. It's cute but annoying. Other than that its a fantastic product.Don't think twice, it will catch all kinds of hair!"
5,Unbelieveable!!!,"Having a corgi & a black lab inside keeps me busy chasing the dog hair. While browsing a corgi website, someone mentioned the Furminator. I already had several combs & brushes but decided to try this last product. Unbelieveable!!! The amount of hair I got off both dogs was amazing but the best part is the decreased amount of hair in my house!! I just comb them for several minutes & the results are incredible. I gave all the other brushes & combs to a local shelter, I don't need them anymore, I've got the FURMINATOR! You owe it to yourself & the dogs you love to purchase this product, your life will be so much easier & your house less cluttered with unwanted hair."
5,FURminator deShedding Tool,"Does your dog shed? Are you picking up hair all over your house? Your car? Your BED?? Well, this tool is for you! We tried many liquid deshedding products, combs and brushes but this tool works the best. We gently comb our Golden Retriever with this 4"" tool and you wouldn't believe the amount of hair we remove from his coat (hair that won't be on the floor, the furniture or ME). I strongly recommend the FURminator!!"
4,No more pet hair! ... well for a few days,"This definitely works. It gets out a surprising amount of hair. However, I still have to brush my dog and cat more often than I was expecting to maintain the effects. I use it about once a week and I have definitely noticed a reduction in hair on my clothes and furniture as a result"
4,FURminator,"I purchased this for my dogs and am somewhat happy with the purchase. This tool definately works at getting out the undercoat hair better than our deshedding tool, but the dogs don't seem to enjoy being brushed as well. Our medium haired dog likes the brush alright as long as you use the brush without too much pressure. Our shorter haired dog (who loves attention and to be brushed) doesn't like it nearly as well as the deshedding tool. I think the sharp tines are just too sharp for the shorter hair. We've also tried this on our long haired cat and it seemed to work quite well. Hopefully, our dogs will become used to the feel because the hair removal works great."
4,You've got to be sheddin' me!,"I highly recommend this if you have multiple pets! The price was unbeatable -- this product goes for at least twice as much elsewhere.My cat and dog love to be brushed with this, and I love that it saves them from shedding all over the place! Brush them next to a wastebasket, as you will get a LOT of fur in the brush and will have to ""empty"" it frequently. That is the only downside to this product -- that the teeth don't hold much hair, so you have to clean it about every 2-3 passes. But it works like a CHARM.Buy this and a Roomba and you will severely reduce the amount of dust bunnies and pet-hair tumble weeds! Happy grooming!"
2,bleeding lab,"The furminator cut my lab. I would not use it again. I combed her with it and left for the day, when I came home later, blood was on the walls and on her fur. I would have mailed it back, but I threw out the box. I did not use it inappropriately, going over a section again and again. It got the fur off, but Ginger was nervous and wondered where the blood came from and kept licking herself."
5,Best thing I ever bought for my dogs!,I love this thing. It was the best money I have ever spent on my dogs. I have two large dogs both who are short haired but still shed a whole lot. I had to vacuum every other day just to keep the hair in control but now things are completely different. I was amazed at the amount of hair that came off of my boys! It seemed like it would never stop coming off of them! They usually hate being brushed but they actually love being brushed with this! The handle is nice and sturdy - I'm glad I bought this product instead of spending the extra money on the newer model because this one does wonders. If you are looking to cut back on vacuuming and using a lint roller than this is the product!
4,FURminator,"The FURminator is an effective tool. I had to go lightly with my cat but it worked perfectly with my horse. I would like a longer blade for the horse and I think the company sells a longer version, but overall it was a good purchase."
3,"Terrific product, slow mailing","The product is as excellent as advertised. I honestly don't have to vacuum as often. However, the seller took 4 days to even put it in the mail. I am not at all satisfied with the shipping from this seller."
2,Too expensive,"I recently purchased one of these tools from someone who had two, and I think it isn't worth the full price. If I was to pay $40.00, I would expect for it to handle fur with tuffs, as well as a damp fur. The product is normally only effective against dry, smooth hair, so I think it's use, you would be better off purchasing something cheaper."
5,Amazing Dog Shedding Tool,This product was everything I had hoped it would be and more. I could hardly believe how much hair I was able to remove from my dog even after using other products prior. I would highly recommend this product to others.
4,Deshedding tool,"Not bad....dog did look a lot better after the first ""deshedding"". Second time, not soo much; but then again maybe her hair wasn't as long this time???Overall, I think it is a good product."
5,This really is an amazing tool,I could NOT believe how much fur came off my cat after using this. She looks smaller and her coat is not only thinner but shinnier. Would highly recommend this tool to anyone who owns a pet that sheds.
3,Somewhat useful,"It was half the width I was expecting - guess I should have checked the details. Works well, but I think you would pay far less if you could find a horse comb- (curry comb).The price in the stores seems ridiculous, that's why I bought this off amazon, but I didn't check the width details, I bought it for a medium sized dog and assumed it would be like the big ones I saw in the pet stores."
4,Great Product!,"I got this for my beagle, who is considered medium-ish. It did remove her undercoat successfully, but she was a bit fidgity. All in all, I'm very happy with the results. It's very hot in Oklahoma and I'm sure it will help her from overheating when she's outside."
3,Does a fair job on short-haired dogs.,"I used this on my niece's dachshund mix and I find it time consuming and not effective in removing a large amount of fur. I use it on the dog outside the house, and am only able to remove a small amount of fur. When the dog comes back into the house, I still find her fur everywhere! This FURminator may be better for removing longer haired fur from pets. Or maybe I need to try a larger FURminator! I would be willing to try another size, because it looks so helpful on the infomercial! I am determined to have fur-free furniture because I love having the dog visit!"
4,FURminator works! (sort of...),"I tried it on my 6 month old Golden; it removed a lot of hair. Like they say; it takes a lot of strokes to get the job done, you'll be there quite a long time; and not just the first time... but, if you're diligent, and have the patience; it does what it says it will do; we have A LOT less hair around the house... which makes sense; it removes A LOT; just takes soooo, looong.... ...on the bright side, it's good bonding time with my doggie!!"
5,FURminator WORKS!,Best Dog Grooming tool we have ever used. Our Shiba Inu loves to be combed with the FURminator. The Furminator has greatly reduced dog hairs in the house.
5,Furminator to the rescue,I am a Lab owner and they are notroious shedders. This Furminator has eleminated shed hair by 95% Her coat has never been more health looking and shiny.
4,Furminator,"I first saw the Furminator listed as a grooming feature in an ad by a local groomer. The ad had a link to the web site, where I learned more about the product. I found the best price at Amazon.com. The product works very well at removing the undercoat from my dog! He's a mixed breed with some Australian Shepard heritage, so he's got that furry layer under his top coat. First, I brush him out with my regular brush to get the knots out. Then I use the Furminator to work out the inner layers. It's amazing how much extra fur comes out! Apply gentle pressure with even strokes, being very careful of (or avoiding) sensitive areas. It's very easy to use. Reduces shedding very well. My dog's coat looks beautiful after grooming!"
3,No easy fix,"I have a double coated dog and still hoping for a quick cure to grooming. I still have to comb and brush my dog well before using this and by then, he's had enough. Might work best for short hair breeds"
4,Hmmmm weird,"It works fantastically on my cats, but oddly enough hardly does anything for my husky/spitz/whatever mix (or my smooth doxie, but that was expected).It was worth it just for what it does for my kitties."
4,Not bad :),I think it worked well got a lot of fur out and reduced the fur all over the place. I would say it should prob be used about every 3 weeks.
5,awesome,I have a foxhound/beagle mix and have dealt with 24/7 shedding for 6 years. I'm so excited to have found something that actually appears to work and cant wait to use it thru all seasons! get one!
5,Love my FURminator,I love this...I have a lab 2 goldens and a chihuahua and I have used it on all of them and it works great. It cuts down on the shedding. I let a friend borrow it for her St. Bernard and it worked great on him too.
3,Furminator or Shaver?,This product does get rid of dog hair but it looks to me like it actually shaves the hair rather than remove dead hair. I can see some bald or thinning spots where it's been used too much.
4,FURminator,It is very good for grooming and deshedding. My black labrador enjoyed being groomed. It is very effective and easy to use.
5,"Performs well, recommended","My dog is a chow/golden retriever mix with long fine hair. The FURminator works well on her coat to remove the shedding hair and undercoat. I've used a metal comb, single row rake, and slicker style brushes before. The single row rake and comb worked decent, but the FURminator will remove significantly more fur even after I can no longer get anything with the other two. The slicker was the poorest performer in terms of removing shedding fur and I had difficulty getting her to stay still to use it since she didn't like the sound of the brush being used. In contrast, she will let me brush her with the FURminator without objection unless she has some static built up which causes some crackles.It is well constructed and feels like it should last a long time. I was debating between this brush and a double row rake (a bit cheaper) and ultimately decided to give the FURminator a try due to the positive reviews I read. I would buy it again if I had it to do over again."
5,Excellent product.,"The furminator is an excellent product and is worth the money I paid for it and then some. It was actually cheaper ordering from Amazon than driving an hour to the closest Pet Smart to buy it. It does an excellent job on Jake's coat I could not believe all the hair I brushed off of him the first time I used it and he loved it. We plan on furminating him often. Excellent product, excellent price, can't ask for more."
5,Revolutionary Product,"There is simply no other product like this for removing a dog's undercoat. I have gotten three other people to shell out $30 for Furminators, and they are all very pleased."
3,Pets do not like furminator,"Many friends love this however, I have 2 cats (one long hair, one short hair) and 2 dogs (mixed terrier who does not like to be touched anyway and a Pom) and not one will permit its use. If considering, remember to be very gentle until you find out how your pets react."
3,Furminator,"We do dog rescue and I have 10 Anatolian Shepards. Other owners raved about this device. The dogs love it. I believe the design is excellent. With my dogs the hair has to be removed after a full body stroke, this to me takes extra time. I would suggest others try it before hand and if the consumer and pet agree then get one."
3,good for removing fur but...,"As described, the Furminator is excellent for removing fur from your shedding pet, but if not carefully used, it seems to cause much discomfort to my cats' skin. I also have a Zoom Groom, which they absolutely love -- they will actually come running for grooming -- but they avoid the Furminator. It may take some time for me to get used to applying the right pressure with this tool and maybe then my cats will like it."
5,Works as described,"The FURminator works extremely well! It takes mounds and mounds of hair of off my labradore. As a bonus, she loves to be brushed with it. She will sit for as long as I want to brush her. A great product"
5,Very pleased. Definately recommend this product!,This was brand new and shipped quickly. I absolutely love this product. I have a dog that normally sheds all the time. I can't imagine not having it.
5,FANTASTIC FURminator !!!!!!!,I could NOT believe my eyes when I saw HOW much fur this brush removed..... I kept thinking YIKES!!! this fur would otherwise have ended up in my house !!! Now I just brush my yellow lab a few times a week..... gently..... and remove ALOT of loose fur !!!!! I have tried a number of brushes over the years.... have seen NOTHING that even comes C L O S E to the FURminator !!!! I loaned it to my neighbor.... he was as shocked as I was !!! He also went out and bought a FURminator !!!!! INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!
1,Do Not Buy This Item!!!,"I purchased one sold by familysafemedia and fulfilled by amazon. It broke and I returned it to Furminator after emailing them photos. They told me it would be replaced as defective. Furminator then received and examined the brush and sent my broken brush back to me -- they told me I had purchased a counterfeit brush. It had their brand name on it and was sold through Amazon fulfillment. How is a customer to know that they're buying a counterfeit? It looked just like the last one I purchased at Petsmart, so I had no way to tell it was a counterfeit. Do Not Buy! Amazon has quickly returned my money, but although familysafemedia is still selling on amazon.com, users are unable to leave them reviews. Seems like someone knew about this issue before I had a problem."
1,Not good for all dogs,"After seeing the great job the Furminator did on my friend's dog, I decided to give it a try on my own dog. I had read reviews that warned about the blade cutting the hair but I was so impressed with the results I had seen firsthand, I got one anyway.I have a Samoyed, a double-coated breed. I started with the Furminator and was disappointed at how little of the undercoat it actually removed. The teeth are not long enough to get through the undercoat and I saw that, along with the little undercoat it was pulling out, there were also long strands from the topcoat in the Furminator. After about 10 minutes I gave up. The Furminator just wasn't effective at getting through her coat and I was concerned about damage to the topcoat. I went back to using my trusty undercoat rake, which is far more effective than the Furminator and doesn't damage the coat.I have seen good results with this product on other dogs, but do not recommend it for breeds with dense undercoats and silky topcoats."
2,Overpriced,"Had I not have just purchased a very fine wire hair comb for $8 from Petco I might be leaving the high feedback you see for this product also. BUT, this $8 wire brush from Petco is actually FASTER at removing hair/fur than theis FURminator is. So, if you have a Petco near you or another pet store, look for brush with small, stiff, fine, closely spaced wires and you will save yourself a bundle."
2,I would not recommend for cats,"I was advised by a local pet store groomer this was the perfect device to use on my long haired cat who mats constantly. I first used it on my other cat and was amazed at how much hair was removed. However, I felt some of the hair was not loose & ready to be shed. When using it on my long haired cat, it did not safely remove the mats but instead wanted to pull them off.I also did not like the sharpness of the blade & felt it was not safe enough to use on ""quick to move"" cats. I now use a rubber glove (labeled to use for dog bathing) with rubber teeth. It safely removes shedding hair, massages their skin and they love it. A friend of mine also tried this and came to the same conclusions.I would not recommend this to any of my friends."
3,Didn't work like YouTube should,"I'll start off by saying that I may have got the wrong size. My dog has very wirery hair. This furminator says it NASA 4"" edge, but it only less than an inch of it is used to help cut hair. I was surprised it didn't work as well as I had seen on YouTube videos. I had high hopes for this and it didn't really do what I thought it was going to do. If you have a dog with soft/short hair it might work better."
5,Love it,This works great to remove loose dog hair without hurting the dog!I would recommend this to all dog owners!
3,Glad it was cheaper on amazon!,Having a Husky is a lot of brushing! The head was not as big as i would like and you still had to use other brushes. All in all I used it a lot But It could have been a little better
3,Go away dog hair,Our dog sheds a lot. This helps keep the mess on the floors to a minimum. Give it a shot.
3,it's ok but not extraordinary,"I have a Jack Russell terrier and purchased this in the summer. Now his coat is pretty short and light this time of year, but based on the other reviews I expected the furminator to pick up more fur than it actually did. It was comparable to regular brushing with a comb. Because it is so short, it does tickle him when i do the sides over his ribs and can't be used on the belly or chest."
2,my dogs hate this tool,"I know several people that love this deshedding tool, but my Scotties hate it.I'm still learning how to use it, so it may get better."
3,not impressed,"Service was great as usual, the product was just O.K. The price with shipping was higher than the local feed store, should have shopped around."
4,"Great deshedder, but dog HATES it","I am very pleased with this product, it definately does what it says it will do...however my dog is not happy with this brush at all. He is a puppy and he becomes very wound up when we try to brush him with the furminator. The second he sees it, he starts jumping in the air (60 pounds of him)and trying to rip the brush from our hands. So, maybe he will grow out of this or eventually get used to it but for now it is a hassle."
5,Great Product,This is a great little product. It makes the shedding problem with my Schipperke most bearable.
1,Destroys your dog's coat!,This brush gets so much fur off your pets because it breaks the hairs and destroys their coat. It will take months for it to recover. Do not use this brush on your pets!
4,furminator,"It is OK, It came cracked but does not affect the use. Just did not want to go through the hassel of sending it back. Not the first time Amazon products were defective. I think they buy seconds because of the price. Thanks"
4,new dog owner,We recently adopted a pug mix who shed a lot this winter. I thought I'd try this. He is not a fan of brushing but I got a TON of hair the first couple times. Now I have less loose hair in the house and weekly brushing has kept it in check. We are all happy. No magic like in the video but he has short hair and it really works nicely.
5,Lives up to its name,It truly does pull out insane amounts of fur - like you can weave a rug each time. My dog loves it because it gets to scratch her skin without irritating it. No complaints!
5,Really helps my beagle,"Our beagle, Odie has short hair but it sheds all day and night, some people tell me, ""beagles never shed,"" well, then come on over and pet this dog for a minute. He's allegedly a beagle, has his papers, looks like one, eats like one, etc. I think it's safe to say at least some beagles shed.It was at the point that maintaining my home was getting harder. I would vacuum the whole hardwood floored house and by dinner time everyone would have hair all over the bottom of their socks and it would be piled all on the steps, again. It made me resent the dog as if he could control the shedding! I was desperate when I found the reviews for this brush. I was about to have a new baby and was contemplating life without a dog. I got it for a steal and it arrived quickly, right away I filled a small bucket with dog hair. It comes off in short tufts that look like hairy caterpillars. Odie loves getting combed with it and I love how much less hair is in my house."
5,BEST BRUSH EVER!!!!,"Don't even bother looking at other brushes. If you have a dog, you need one of these. It is amazing. Gets the undercoat too!!!! I feel like I could make a 2nd pet every week with how much fur this thing gets from my lab."
5,Wow-It really works!,The FURminator works wonders on your animal's coat. It removes an amazing amount of loose hair leaving the coat looking healthy and minimizing the amount of shed hair around the house. Definitely worth the price. The 1.75 inch edge is a good size for animals from cats to med-large dogs.This product is far superior to (and different than) a standard grooming brush.
5,BEst de-shedding tool ever,This is a great product! I have a yellow lab that sheds everywhere but ever since I started using this product there isnt as much hair everywhere.
1,DOGS ONLY,"I RECEIVED THIS ITEM..READ INSTRUCTIONS ""AND"" WARNINGS..I FIRST TRIED IT ON MY HAIR...WHICH IT ""CUT""...WARNINGS: DO NOT GO OVER SAME AREA, DO NOT PRESS DOWN..IT HAS A BLADE OF SOME KIND AND CAN HURT THE SKIN. CAT'S HAVE FINE COATS COMPARED TO DOGS..I SENT MINE BACK SAME DAY I RECEIVED IT...NOT FOR CATS (IF YOU CARE ABOUT HARMING YOUR CAT THAT IS)"
5,Love It,Hair be gone!! MY DOG love I. All 6 Just love it Yes you can fill up a room with all the hair thats comes off.
5,A shedding tool that really works !!!,"I have a Pug puppy and although his coat is short haired he sheds quite a bit. I have tried other tools to help control or combat shedding, but the Furminator gets the hair under the top coat, making it a superb tool for my double coated Pug.It only takes 2 or 3 minutes to get the job done and the dog doesn't seem to mind it at all (so it can't be hurting him by pulling hair out thats not actual shed). Once again I got a great deal on this product through Amazon.com as opposed to the pet store chains.If your dog has a similar coat to my Pugs I would strongly suggest buying a Furminator."
2,Unimpressed for short-hair dogs,"I heard all the hype about the Furminator, and when my house-proud hubby started complaining about dog hair, I decided to spend the money. Can't recommend it for short hair dogs like my chihuahua - the flea comb removes almost as much hair and for far less money. If I still had the receipt, I'd return this product to Petsmart. People with shaggy, long-haired dogs may like this - but I'm guessing a shedding rake like I used to use on my GSD mix would still be just as good.One thing: it was uncomfortable for my 6# pup to get ""Furminated."""
4,FURminator took care of my shedding problem,My little dog is pure white and sheds everywhere. The FURminator takes off a lot of excess hair and she doesn't shed near as bad.
4,Does remove the excess hair,"We have 3 cats in a small apartment; we will buy just about anything that reduces the amount of cat hair that accumulates.This brush definitely helps with keeping our home cleaner. It also keeps the cats coats looking shiny and beautiful.I use this brush in conjunction with a standard cat brush for optimal results.This brush takes a few times to get the hang of the angle which will remove the most excess hair, and each cat is a little different.After you've perfected your angle this is a great brush!"
5,the furminator rocks,It's the best grooming tool I've used yet on my two very thick and hairy huskies. It only takes me a few minutes to shave them down to a comfortable hair length for the summer when before I would be brushing with 3 different tools for weeks to get them ready for the heat.
5,Furminator Keeps House Clean & Dog Smooth,"Great product! Highly recommend! When used several times a week, it drastically reduces the amount of hair in my house! Love it! Borrowed one from a friend to check it out and immediately went home and ordered one! It's a miracle!"
5,My cat and I LOVE the furminator!,"I was sceptical at first but as soon as I used the Furminator on my cat, I became a believer. The sheer amount of fur that came off in one sitting was amazing! My adult male cat sheds ALOT which affects my allergies and asthma. I used to groom him every day but he still left fur all over my place. This shedding has been greatly reduced since using the Furminator and his fur is softer and feels silky. It does produce static cling but that is a minor inconvenience for me."
5,FURMINATOR,"Wasn't too sure about buying this ""newer de shedding"" tool. We have plenty of brushes and rakes around here for the dogs, kitties and quite a few for the horses......Heard people talking about how much they like the FURminator... finally had to give in and give it a shot myself.We have two black labs that I swear shed all over our house the whole year. I could not believe how much fur came off the dogs with this FURminator the first day, no wonder they shed all over!Now I use it about once a week and still get fur off them, not as much in the house... and I like that!!!"
4,Wonder Deshedder,This is an excellent product for getting rid of the hair my dog is shedding. Only problem is that she's afraid of it (I think it's the yellow color) and I have to be careful in my approach to her. She cannot see it coming!
4,Small Furminator tool,The FURminator Small Blue deShedding Tool works well.The only problem I see is that there is not an automatic release for the fur.
2,furminator,Doesn't remove as much hair as I would like. My dogs still shed excessively even when groomed regularly with the furminator.
5,A comb that works,This brush really works. Amazing to see the amount of fur that comes off during the first use.Using it a few times a week lowers the amount a fur you have to clean up elsewhere in the housse.
5,I LOVE this!,"This is the best dog brush I have found! My dog won't let me touch her with other metal brushes, but she actually seems to enyoy this one. It thins the undercoat and greatly reduces shedding. I use it once a week or so, and have noticed a drop in the amount I have to sweep!I tried to buy basically the same brush at a local pet store and it was $60.... for a DOG BRUSH. So I'm pretty pleased with the price of this one!"
5,Furminator,Excellent Product at removing pet dander and undercoat. My dog loves to be groomed by the Furminator as it stimulates the undercoat and leaves him feeling happier.
4,Fur no more,"This is a great help on cutting down on dog hair in the house. I have 2 large dogs so bought the large size furminator. The dogs don't seem to mind it and I do notice a significant reduction in shedding. It does seem to pull the hair slightly though, similiar to hair thinning shears. My dogs are short haired and I don't think that I would want to use it on a long hair collie type dog as it looks like it would not give good grooming results. A co-worker is using one on her cats and gives her approval for it's performance. Her 7 cats seem to enjoy the grooming and it has made her housecleaning chores more manageable. I would recommend this but not as the only grooming tool in the household."
5,Great de-shedding tool!,This little gadget is easy to use and your dog will love it. THE RESULTS WILL AMAZE YOU!
4,I Love the Furminator,"I have a yellow Lab who seems to shed year round. The furminator removes the hair and makes it easy to dispose of as well. I used to use a metal horse comb. The furminator works just as well if not better, and its much easier to contain the hair after combing it out. I believe it was one of my better purchases."
5,Furminator removes hair,"The Furminator is great. I was skeptical about spending so much money on a brush/comb for the dog because I see so many in the stores for much less, but a friend had recommended the Furminator. We are really happy with it, it truly is worth the money. We have seen a decrease of hair in the house since we have begun using the Furminator. Would definitley recommend."
5,Great grooming tool,"Bought it for our Lab, but also have cats and it isn't too big for them, they like it much more than the dog. Well made product."
2,Irritated my dog's skin,"I was disappointed by this product for two reasons: 1) while it did pull out a lot of hair, it wasn't enough to make that much of difference around the house, especially when considering 2) how much it irritated his skin. He didn't stop scratching for for a week after using."
2,Furminator,"Product is what it says it is. I personally don't like it, the blade cuts hair as it removes the undercoat. The blade gets clogged with hair with one brush stroke."
5,A dream for my husky,"I received the product about two weeks ago and on the first use I got a HUGE pile of hair from our husky. Shes currently shedding off her winter coat so normally it would be a huge mess. However, this tool has greatly helped! I use it every other day and we have almost zero hair in the house. You wouldn't even be able to tell shes shedding her winter coat. If you have a husky or any dog that sheds you shouldn't think twice in debating over buying the tool. It really does work and works really well. The dog even enjoys being combed with it!"
4,Works great,"The Furminator works great on my Lab. I must say, however, you still need to use the rake and slicker. The Furminator hits the undercoat."
2,Not for all dogs,"I bought this to use on a Jack Russell who somehow manages with her little body to cover every square inch of my house in hair. This seemed like a solution to this problem, and I was anxious to see how it would work. However, when I finally tried it on her, I realized that her coat is too thin for this tool. The metal teeth are very sharp and it seemed to irritate her too much to be useful. It did pick up a decent amount of hair; I can see why it would be useful for most breeds. Bottom line, if you have a dog with a thin coat, this might not be for you."
3,furminator is nice but gets dull,"I wish I could explain it, but the tool works like a champ. Not only did it remove a lot of undercoat without much effort (and even teased out slightly matted hair with a bit of work) but both dogs put up with it MUCH better than with any other method so far; one of them even went so far as to lie down to be groomed, which he NEVER does. In over ten years of owning these guys, they've never looked better with less effort. In short: I don't want to like it, because I don't want to admit I paid so much for a glorified comb, but it works like a champ. Highly recommended. Two labs here, and we've tried a number of things--ZoomGrooms, combs, brushes, undercoat rakes, those groovy serrated flexible metal things... none worked particularly well, and the dogs lost interest and patience very quickly. Then our vet-tech recommended the furminator. I was very resistant, not necessarily for the price but just because I couldn't believe it was that much different."
5,This is all you need,"I have a beagle mix and the FURminator really works well for him - you wouldn't think a little beagle could shed so much, but he does! I'm not really sure why this works so much better than other combs and brushes, all I know is that it does. my dog doesn't seem to mind it either - he sniffs it and tries to lick it sometimes - so I let him sniff and get comfortable with it and then I start to brush him gently - no need to put a lot of pressure into the brushing action, a little bit will get a lot of fur off. I recommend it to anyone with pets - they have smaller versions for small dogs and cats as well as huge ones for the bigger dogs. give it a try and you'll see what I mean! happy brushing!"
5,Like magic,"The Furminator is awesome! I have a Lab and a Labernese, and have tried so many different kinds of brushes. The Furminator, hands down, is the best one I have ever tried. It takes out so much fur, and the dogs actually like to be brushed now. The Labernese used to run away every time I brought out the brush, but now it's like he doesn't even notice that he's being brushed. I LOVE the Furminator!!"
2,"Okay, but not as great as expected....","I'm not sure why, but this deshedder didn't give me the miraculous results others have gotten. I have a Bullmastiff with a dense short coat and he's not a terrible shedder, but if I go a couple days without a brush-out, it's apparent. I use this and expected that after six or eight times running the tool across his back I'd capture all the loose hairs. But he continues to shed right after a vigorous brushing. I'm feeding him quality dog food, but he's a rescue, so perhaps I have to wait a few months to see results. Anyway, the product does get hair out, but it's far short of my expectations to end my grooming exercise with a mostly loose-hair-free dog."
5,Not covered in hair anymore,"I wasn't sure how this would work but the reviews were positive so I decided to try it. I couln't take the amount of hair that was all over. I have a black sectional and if you didn't vacuum it everyday it would be covered in hair. I am undergoing chemotherapy so I don't have enough energy to clean everyday. I never imagined how much hair a Shepherd would shed, more than my Golden Retriever did. She is a Silver Sable so her hair is light in color and shows on everything. I tried this out and could't believe how much hair came off. I try to comb her every other day and it makes a world of difference. I would totally reccommend thids product."
3,works okay,"I bought the small one so I could use it on my cats and medium-sized dog. It works pretty well on the cats, but my dog has coarse, thick hair (Corgi), and I have a difficult time getting it through to the skin. The blades are the same on all sizes, so the size isn't the problem. It works okay, but because the blades are short and close together, I have to press hard to get it through her coat. It seems to pull and hurt her a little, so I stopped using it on her. I found a different product yesterday for her--Oster makes one called ShedZilla that has longer, wider, and safely blunted blades that easily go through even her hair, AND she seemed to enjoy it! So if your pet has this kind of hair, the FURminator might not work as well as you hoped. It is pretty good for shorter, thinner, or finer coats though."
4,"Furminator Large, Yellow,4 in.","I am so happy that I finally decided to order this wonderful tool! The price was good and it is great! I have a golden retriever and english mastiff in my house, so lots of hair! Surprisingly, my mastiff, even though short haired, sheds really bad!! This has helped me to keep up with the hair problem at home. Thank you very much!"
5,Black Lab loves to be brushed,My black Lab loves to be brushed with theFURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge. She rolls from side to side so I can get her whole body.
5,FURminator Tool,This is the very best tool I have found for grooming my cats. It really does what the ad says and the cats seems to enjoy it. It is very sharp so you do have to go slow and not apply a lot of pressure. I have a medium haired cat and a short haired cat. It seems to work the best on the medium haired cat.
5,deshedding tool,all i have to say is i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!! my dog and couch thank me :) i cant belive i didnt buy this sooner
4,furminator and my dog,"i have a pekingese a very hairy one , i tried all the ususal devices with little sucess , after haveing to get rid of my carpet sweeper because of the fur i decided to get the furminator, it took a while for him to get used to it however now i am amazed at the amount of fur it removes.great product, best price at Amazon"
5,Excellent tool for grooming winter coat on horses,"My grey mare grows very long hair for her winter coat and this is the best tool by far for gently pulling out the old dead winter hair. By using the Furminator for several weeks before show season, I avoided the expense and necessity of body clipping. It was money well spent!"
3,"Works great on one of my 2 dogs, but they don't care for it","This works as described and gets a ton of hair off of my Terrier. It doesn't do much of anything for the Lab-mix, who also sheds a lot, but has a smoother single coat. This is not a flexible brush, so the dogs don't really care to be brushed with it. It is also VERY messy because it doesn't catch any of the hair, so we have to go outside to brush them. Personally, I think a brush with nylon bristles on one side and wire bristles on the other works better. They are also considerably less expensive."
3,So-so results,"I purchased the furminator along with the shampoo and treatment (aka conditioner) and so far have only been moderately impressed. The furminator defintely gets rid of the undercoat, however, I still feel like my dog is shedding quite a bit."
3,ok product,Not a bad product but it works better on my cat then on my dog. I originally purchased for my dog - I was disappointed.
5,Great Product,"The Furminator is such a great product. I have a yellow lab that sheds and when we use the Furminator it reduces the shedding by a lot. Easy to use, but need to do brush every other day to get the results you want."
4,The purrrr-minator,"We had originally gotten this for the dog, and it works fairly well on her, but it works really well on the cat. He loooooves getting brushed with the Furminator and will keep pawing at it until you pick it up and keep brushing him. The cat sheds more than the dog, so it worked out well. If you have a long-haired dog it will probably work better than a short-haired, but it's still better than just letting them shed everywhere."
4,Great product!,"I have a german shepherd, who's hair seems to take over the house. This product is great for getting rid of the undercoat. It also works well on my shorthaired mutt, and even on my cats.The only thing that would make the furminator better is if it came as an attachment to the vacuum, to keep the hair from getting all over the place.Otherwise, it's works great!"
5,Works for my cat,"Good tool, works great on my cat. But no matter how many times I use it, fur keeps coming out. Either the tool's cutting some fur, or my cat's really furry."
3,furminator,Works fairly well. I get lots of hair off my dog when using it. However it has NOT helped with the shedding.
5,Great product with ridiculous low price!,I will buy from this seller again for sure! It was delivered quickly with no problems. This brush is $49.99 at Petco and I bought it for 13.00 including shipping. All of the professional groomers use this product It decreases shedding immensely on my Chocolate Lab using it just once a week.
3,"Works, but Hurts","My sister originally told me about the Furminator. Don't get me wrong, it does the job. However, it will also scratch your dog if you are not careful. My dog really hates it, and like I said, I have scratched him with it - even though I am diligent in not doing so. Just be careful if you get this."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I have a black dog who sheds constantly. I had all my hopes up that this would be the tool. But my dog hates it and gets very upset if I use it on her. I keep trying, and she keeps fighting me, and the hair keeps falling!I don't know if it is just my dog, or if the blade is dull or what the problem could be. But it is useless to me."
2,Furminator comb,My Furminator came with a plastic protector that is supposed to clip over the teeth to protect them. But in no way will that protector stay attahced to the comb. It so loose that it doesn't even attempt to attach itself to the tool. It was the first thing I noticed and the ideological ideas about quality start right there. Why they makers would send this useless attachment is beyond me. Perhaps some one from on high will explain it to me.
5,five star!!!!,"We've had this for over a year now, and it's still working just as amazing as the first day!"
2,Bigger isn't better,"I bought the bigger furminator this time because I had the smaller one and figured that the bigger one would be better. That isnt the case, the bigger one was harder to use and didnt remove as much hair as the smaller one. I was using them on both on a Yellow Lab, so I figured it wouldn't matter, but I will stick w/the smaller one its by far the best one! Go smaller!"
5,My pets are pounds lighter!,"Both of my dogs and cats seem pounds lighter and do not shed for several weeks after I used the FURminator! Be careful on Cats when brushing right down the middle of their back and other bony parts of their torso, it can irritate their thin skin!"
5,Best Dog Comb/Brush I've Owned,"When a friend recommended this product I decided to try it as just another comb/brush I've purchased. Wow. It's incredible. My dog likes me using it. It gets the undercoat easily. And her fur felt softer and ""detangled"" after the first use - even though she'd been being brushed/combed regularly. Wish I had known about it sooner. I highly reommend the Furminator."
3,Excellent tool....for certain breeds of dog,"I have two dogs...one is a Rottie mix and the other is a Yellow Lab mix. When used on the Rottie, the result was nothing short of amazing. An enormous pile of hair came off of her and her hair looked pretty and shiney. The Yellow Lab also had a big pile of fur come off but she looked like she was an elderly balding man. She had patches of baldness and her coat looked dried and broken off in some spots. YES, the shedding has cut down a lot on both my dogs but please be aware of what it does to certain breeds' coats."
3,Furminator bites the hair,This product worked great for my German Shepard. Not so well on my flat coat or sammy. The hair on the GSD is just right for this product. A plain old rake works bests on my other two.
3,"Great for cats, didn't work for dogs","I bought this with the intention of using it on my two pugs which both have heavily shedding undercoats. Neither of them liked the feel of the brush - it was too heavy and too rough on their bodies - and it did a poor job of getting the hair. I don't know if it's the kind of exterior coat they have or my technique, but I had almost no success with brushing the dogs. However, my cats both loved this brush AND it worked great - tons of hair came out, helped to cut down shedding for them. Would definitely recommend for cats or dogs with different types of coats, perhaps."
4,Furminator,This is the greatest tool for all the excess hair on your dog. It is just like the commercial says. You can take off bags of hair. I have a yellow lab that sheds so much through any season. And he doesn't mind it like some of the other tools I have used.
4,The Furminator Really Furminates!,"I first saw this tool at the vets office and I thought how great. I have my Granddog, a Lab-Chow mix, who sheds an entire dog's worth of hair each week. This tool really does a great job of getting the loose hair before it becomes part of the carpet. If you have a dog who sheds a lot, this tool is a must."
5,Works as advertized,"I have cats and dogs and I've used it on both. It's a bit wide for my cats, but it still works great, especially on my himalayan furball. The first time I used it I got a huge pile of fur off of her. She looks a bit smaller, but still has beautiful long fur. She actually enjoys it and licks my hand while I'm brushing. Brushing is not quite the right word, it's more like raking. I watched a couple of you-tube videos to see what the technique was...long stokes and don't apply too much pressure, etc. I'm happy with my purchase and the price. The local pet store charges much more for the same type of tool."
3,Average,"After reading all the glowing reviews I couldn't wait for THE furminator to arrive, I was disappointed when it did. It does an okay job, nothing like the video on their website or the reviews on Amazon would have me to believe. I am still cleaning the dog hair off the floor daily. I am glad I didn't pay full price at the pet store."
1,"Yes, it rips dog's fur","Instead of removing shedding fur, it rips fur. My dog hates the experience. I wish I had paid more attention to the 1 and 2 starred reviews before investing in this product."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be - don't waste your $$!,"I have 2 Czech working lines German Shepherd dogs, and I groom them regularly. I was really looking forward to this as something that did ""what no other grooming tool could do"", so I ended up dropping the $$ for it, assuming it'd be worth the price. Don't bother - the $9.00 undercoat rake from Leerburg works much better, the dogs like it better, and, oh, yeah - the price is SUBSTANTIALLY different."
3,"Good, but not as good as it seems","I was referred to this product by a groomer, and it doesn't seem to work as good as if it were just the blade from the clippers she demonstrated with. It does get out the fur underneath his longer hair, but it isn't very comfortable for my dog and the fur gets stuck in the teeth and isn't that easy to remove. I wouldn't buy this again necessarily, but I'll use it since I have it. If I were to get something again it would be a very fine toothed metal comb. It would get deeper into the fur and wouldn't be as rough on my dog's skin. He is a beautiful Tibetan Spaniel."
4,Great Product!,"I love this brush and so does my lab! So much hair comes off EVERY time I use this... I'm surprised she has any left on her body! After using this brush for a couple weeks, I have noticed a considerable difference in the amount of hair I vaccuum and sweep up in the house. She still sheds a bit, but a LOT less than before!! And because she loves it so much, I'm going to continue using this product!"
3,FURminator- A Lot of Fluff,"This is just an average tool. While it did get to the undercoat, I would not say that this is any better than some of the other deshedding tools I have used. The tool itself is easy to hold, but the fine teeth do get caught in animal's coat if one is not careful. Would not recommend for the price it is."
4,Works well Still a little expensive,"Works well, I have a long haired St.Bernard, Got alot of the loose hair out and made his coat look nicer. Although for this much over the price of a regular dog brush, I wish the large were a little larger."
4,Best de-shedder ever....,I have a German Shephard that sheds badly and a wife with allergies and no desire to constantly vacuum. I've tried every de-shedding tool on the market and this is BY-FAR the best. It's also cheapest on Amazon.com.....Highly recomended.
4,This really works?,I purchased the furminator after reading many good reviews. I hated to spend the money for something that did not really work. I have 2 Dalmatians and although they are short haired they really shed alot. I have noticed less hair on their bedding and on my floors. Try it!
4,It works but could be bigger,We have a black lab mix and she leaves fur everywhere. I bought the medium size tool and it's really small. I mean it works but it takes longer because it's a small tool. I should have gotten the larger version but since they're not cheap I'm just going to keep and deal with what I got.
5,Short haired dog.... no problem,I bought the FURminator with some skepticism since I have a 6 yr old short haired amstaff. He has been shedding like crazy due to the end of winter and I was at the point that I was willing to try anything. I began using the FURminator on him and he wasn't sure about it at first... after about 5 minutes he was in love and I couldn't believe the amount of fur it pulled off him! Skepticism is gone... this is a must have for all pet owners!!!
4,Great tool at this price!,"I purchased this comb based on the recommendations of some friends who had paid full price at another store. I was happy to find that the price on Amazon is only half of what they paid! The comb works as advertised. It pulls out a lot of the undergrowth, which has greatly reduced the amount of shedding that my 60 lb. collie mix has been doing. The comb does tend to generate static, but that is the only remotely negative thing I could say about it. It works well and is easy to clean. Plus my dog absolutely loves how it feels. She gets excited when we bring it out! The large was the right size for her. I would definitely recommend this product, especially at this price."
3,irritating,"The Furminator did remove a lot of undercoat hair on the cats that would sit still, but a couple of cats hated it, and I think it was irritating their skin. I need to learn to be more careful with it."
5,Fabulous,Product really gets to the loose hair on my dogs. It has greatly reduced the amount of shedding on the floor day to day.
5,Great Product!,"We have a yellow lab who sheds a ton of hair each day. This is the best brush that I have ever used. Her hair comes off in clumps when I use it. I do try to use it gently because the blades could be sharp and the instructions tell you to brush lightly, so be careful when brushing your pet."
4,Over all Not Too Bad,This product works well on my German Shephard but I do have to agree that a Curry Comb works almost as well and is 1/4 the cost. Over all I'm happy with the product.
5,Less hair on the floor to sweep up,"I've used other shedding tools, but I guess I liked this one the best. It's a little wider than others I've used and has a chunky handle with a comfortable configuration for brushing the dog. Just a few strokes and handfuls of hair come out (which I can put in the trash knowing it's hair that isn't ending up on my floor). My dog is a Lab mix with a short and not too thick coat, so it works perfectly. I know others that have Shepherds who've complained it's more difficult and takes a bit more time due to the very thick coat and very closely-tined comb. The only thing is I've noticed that my dog is very sensitive when I use it around his rear legs and under his tail (but there's lots of hair shedding from those spots, and I want to get at them). So, I just make sure I use it slowly and gently in order not to make it a negative experience for my dog. Along his neck and back though, he is in heaven when I use it."
5,"I was skeptical, but it really works.","I must admit, I was quite skeptical about this brush, but after using it for a half hour one night and still coming up with more fur, I am a believer. It takes a while to get all the loose fur off the first time you use the brush, and your animal might not be willing to sit for the whole grooming session. Subsequent brushings are not as time intensive, but just as effective.If you use the shampoo, my groomer says to brush afterward."
4,furminator dog brush,"The shipping had major problems. The brush didn't arrive anywhere near the maximum delivery date, BUT the customer service person I heard from via email was EXTREMELY helpful. I ended up receiving one brush 17 days after ordering and a second 20+ days after ordering. I sent the second back immediately.I've used the brush extensively on our 2 ever-shedding German shepherds with excellent results. The brush doesn't bother them and removes piles of hair. Worth the wait, and I'm very happy I ordered it.I can't compliment you enough on your email customer service."
4,Very Pleased,"Not sure how this works, but it does. I get piles of hair after only two minutes of brushing, once a week."
3,Convince the cat,"I like the design of this took, and if I could get my cat to agree, I think it would work really well. I have a short hair cat who doesn't mind being brushed otherwise, but he is not too happy with this brush. If I can get him to cooperate it seems to work well and brush out layers of fur well, but I don't think the cat is giving it two thumbs up."
5,Furminator,"Bought the furminator and it is the, if you excuse the expression, the greatest thing since sliced bread!I love it for both cats and dogs."
5,best grooming tool.,Until using this product I was unaware of how much fur my little animal had. Works great at thinning the undercoat while at the same time leaves the top coat shiny and healthy. Very pleased with product.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS,I misplaced my first shedding tool and once the weather started warming up I was panicking because I couldn't find it! I have 3 cats and one has long white fur (and my couch and bedding is a dark blue). I love this thing it helps keep the stray fur out of my face :)
4,Ok performance.,The FURminator works ok. I have a pomeranian and her hair tends to get tangled easy and the deshedding tool pulls her hair more than not. I do use the tool some just not as much as I thought I would.
2,not so good,"i bought this for my lab who sheds like crazy whenever you pet her. the furminator is great for the undercoat but grabs very little of the long thick surface hairs. if i give her a good scratch after a brush with the furminator she still loses a ton of that thick hair, i guess ill stick to rubbin her down to lose the hair."
5,Awesome for all short haired dogs !,"You will be very happy with the results for all short haired dogs.They make a simular rack style brush at Wal Mart for around six bucksthat works great for long haired dogs etc German Shepards, retrivers.It is shaped the same as the Furmanator, except it has 7-10longer rounded spikes, that works great, and is very easy to clean.So Furmanator on short haired dogs....Wal mart rake for long haired dogs."
5,Wonder Comb!,"Does a fantastic job getting the undercoat out. One word of caution, do not press hard (skin irritation potential). Follow directions for the safety of your dog. Beats just brushing by a mile."
3,"Good, but not great","The tool does a decent job for combing the dog, but it is hyped quite a bit. It's not as awesome as some have claimed. I guess I had higher expectations of it from reading the reviews. It removes a lot of hair from the dog and is good along the back and sides, but I think other brushes we've had did better on the legs and our dog liked them more for that part of his body. He does seem to enjoy having his back combed more with this brush.It's a good sturdy product and I think it will last a long time, probably longer than cheaper brushes. Also I think the handle design is better, heavier and more comfortable than most brushes we've had. The teeth of the comb are substantial and can get down deeper than the cheap brushes with the fine wire bristles.The vendor delivered it quickly and I was happy to get the brush at a significant discount and not have to pay shipping. I wouldn't pay $31 for another one though."
3,works ok,the Furminator works well. I have a Huskey and he has a heavy coat and it does help some with cutting down on the shedding by keeping him brushed good
2,Not for my type dog,I have a dog that has husky hair and it just doesn't work good. Gave it to my daughter who has a yellow lab and it works great for her.
4,Not the real FURminator?,"I purchased this tool, and it shipped from China with packaging that did not look authentic. But it does a decent job of getting out my dog's pin hairs, and it's much more affordable than the FURminator, so I would probably buy it again."
4,Great for med length dogs,A great help to cut the cost of grooming. Dog sat and didn't seem bothered. Will use as needed in future.
4,This thing could go on forever,"Trust me when I say that 4 stars is NOT a good rating for this. I was expecting 5 stars, after it was hyped up by a friend and because of the high price (even though Amazon had the cheapest by far). We could use this thing on our dog forever and hair would just keep coming out. Trust me.It's a good product, but GREAT? Probably not. Would I recommend it to others? Probably, but keep in mind that it may not work on all dogs."
5,"With four cats, this is a must!","I love the furminator. I never realized how much hair the cats really had until I used this on them. It really gets into the undercoat, and when used regularly, I do notice a difference around the house - less cat hair everywhere! I had a hard time spending the money for a cat brush, but I'm glad I did.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,Not sure if it works???,"I would love to review it, but the fact of the matter is, I haven't recieved it yet! I ordered it about a month ago and it still isn't here..."
2,Works like the basic combs that cost $2,I was surprised that it worked the same as a regular wire brush. I combed the dong on one side with this brush and the other with regular wire brush..no difference
3,Its Okay,"Not as good as some of the reviews say. you have to go over and over and if I was a dog I would say it starts to hurt. But it did take alot of loose hair off, have to clean the teeth after every swipe."
5,Unbelievable,"Been a dog owner for over 10 years. I have two large dogs, one long hair and one short. I have never found a brush like this which removes so much excess fur. It's amazing. Our cat even loves it. He'll lay there forever if we keep brushing him."
1,deshedder,"I have a beagle/chow mix and she has fur like a chow and coloring like a beagle. She sheds a lot, but this did not remove much of the shedding fur.FURminator Small Blue deShedding Tool with 1.7-Inch Edge"
3,Great!,"This product is great. REALLY gets the hair off. My only complain is that for 45 lb dogs they suggested the medium, I would buy the large next time."
2,"Works ok, But, Not Worth The Price","My cats did not like the rough edges on the comb's teeth. I have had the item for several months, rarely use it, and can't decide if I like it or not. I'm sure it works much better on dogs than it does on cats. The larger the animal, I think, the better results you will have. It just doesn't work well on small pets."
5,For shedding dog!!!!YES,If you have an animal that sheds or is blowing their coat then this is a miracle worker on removing hair and undercoats. Only complaint is some of the teeth broke quite easily pulling threw coat.But I would buy this again
5,Furminator rocks,"Fabulous product for every home with pets, from cats to small dogs in this size. Way less shedding and fewer hairball barfings"
5,Awesome,"My black lab looks shinier and thinner after a good brushing with this thing, and the house is so much cleaner."
5,Works as described,"I've been eyeing the furminator for a while to use on my short-haired cat. A friend recently gave me an extra one she had, and I've just spent the evening furminating kitty. Just as in the photos, kitty here has heaps of hair around him that I have removed with this tool. He seems to really like it for the most part (he does get annoyed after several minutes). It's as effective as I hoped."
4,It Works,My 3 lb. papillon was beginning to really mat up in the summer heat (one entire month of approx. 100 degrees). Her coat was not silky the way it had always been. The furminator removed all of the undercoat which I am sure helped her with the heat situation. Her coat has returned to its silky self. Thanks
4,Okay,"My dog doesn't have long hair, but its long enough that this product was really hard to use on him. It's advertised that it works on long hair, but it was so difficult I never got through his whole coat. It does pull out a lot of hair from what I was able to get so I still liked having it. It is good sturdy quality too. Would be ideal for short haired animals I think."
4,Good but Painful,"This brush was great for getting my long-haired Husky's undercoat out. He looked like a different dog! My only concern is that this brush works too well, my Husky seemed to be in a bit of pain because it was basically ripping the hair right out. Our Vet instructed us to brush him in 'sections', a different section every day until finished. But the brush bothered him so badly I didn't have the heart to do it more then one day in a row, we had to do it all at once."
4,An entertaining look at the making of an independent film,"Written from the screenwriter's point of view, Hard Core Roadshow is about the making of a brilliant Canadian film, Hard Core Logo. Having seen and liked the movie, I then read the book by Michael Turner. There is a long road between the book and the movie and Noel Baker takes you on the journey, showing how the movie came to be from the initial blind luck of his getting the assignment through the laborious writing process, casting, financing and finally filming. This book should be required reading for anyone contemplating a career in screenwriting and will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in filmaking."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"For those who enjoyed the Beginner's Bible by Karyn Henley, this is NOT it! I gave Karyn's bible to my son seven years ago and was looking for a replacement for my daughter. I bought this bible by mistake because the illistrations and title were so similar and have been hugely disappointed. It lacks depth and purpose in the stories. This book might as well been written by an athiest who can spout out a story line but lacks any genuine understanding behind the story. If looking for a children's bible I strongly recommend finding a Beginner's Bible by Karen Henley (used or new) rather than settling for this or any other children's edition that reduces these stories to a trite sequence of events."
5,Terrific starter Bible for kids 2 to 7,The Beginners Bible picks out the popular events of the Old and New Testament and is written in simple easy-to-understand way for kids 2 years old to about 7 years old. The illustrations are wonderfully done and my daughter and I read it at least twice over when she was about 3.
2,Not a thoughtful rendition,"The problem with this beginners Bible is how it represents God. Imagine, the story of Noah begins with God being ""sad"" because people didn't think of him (and so consequently flooding the earth). This makes God seem like a tyrant to a small child (imagine creating fear in a child re: thinking of God). The actual scripture says ""the thoughts of man were only evil all of the time."" This could be better put into child language such as God felt upset because the people he made kept hurting each other and doing mean things to each other (so SOMETHING closer to the idea in scripture). A kind of lazy thinking dominates both the text and illustrations (which lack any depth or expression besides googley eyes). Imagine my dismay when I received three for my sons first birthday. As someone who does not like to take God's name in vain, I feel this thoughtless representation does just that."
4,for the beginner's beginner,"Great beginner book for your very young kids. Goofy fun illustrations, very easy to read and understand. This will start your child on their way to having a base knowledge of these stories. Obviously, you will need to go beyond this book once your kid hits 6 or 7 (more content and meaning will be necessary), but this is a great place to start (as many of the strong reviews attest)."
5,great book for children,We received this same bible for our son after his birth and loved reading it to him so much that we purchased it as a gift for our niece's baptism.
4,Beginner's Bible,The Beginner's Bible Deluxe Edition: Timeless Children's Stories is Excellent. The kids loved it! Beautiful pictures. Poignant stories for children.
5,Really Sweet Bible.,"This is a sweet Bible. I bought three Bibles for my grandchildren. This one has pretty pictures, is easy to read for children or parents and it's a great price."
3,too young,Probably good for young children with no faith basis but I cogitated for my 4yr old and it was way watered down and yyiung for him. He was asking where certain things were. Genisis is covered I. 2 pages
5,Developmentally Appropriate,"This Bible is perfect for children ages 2-6. They learn the stories of the Bible in a coloful, easy to understand format."
5,My daughter loves it,My 4 yr old loves her new bible! Very vibrant and sturdy book! The text is a larger print and great for beginning readers.
5,"Timeless, indeed.","I, being 21, own the original Timeless Children's stories beginners bible. I loved it ever since I was a kid and the thing I remember the most vividly were the simplistic stories and that the characters (appearance wise) were ones I could relate to. I've read reviews on here that said that there were things left out from the stories. You all have to understand that the book is for children. It cant be told in the same way it's told to us. We have different translations of the bible ourselves! I purchased this for my nephew and he loves it! He can read and comprehend every sentence (except for place names). I think it's lovely that they have a bible like this. It's not too watered down and it tells the story! I cant wait until he's a little older and I can tell him the details , but right now i'm fine with setting a foundation for him to grow off of."
2,i thought it was in spanish,i thought i had ordered a spanish book i work with sstreet children in mexico ..so this is an issue for me now
2,Simplistic and inaccurate,"I agree with the other 2 two star reviews I have read.I know the version I have (earlier copyright) on page 357 under 'The Net' story it states""The good people will get to stay in God's kingdom, but the bad people will not.""Really? John 3:36 and Isiah 64:6 and the rest of the Bible teachings refute that good people will be in heaven because no human is perfectly good.How good is good? And how many bad things make you bad? It is whether you are a true believer or an unbeliever, not good or bad. None of us are perfectly good."
4,A great choice for young children,"We received this book as a gift about 8 years ago for our first child. We began reading it to our son when he was very young, and he began expecting to read it every night. He would say when he was about 4, ""I want to hear the stories about Jesus. ""I have continued to read this to my other children, and they all become quickly engaged by the pictures and easy to understand story lines. I disagree with other reviewers that it lacks depth. It tells the stories that are most appropriate for children in a straight-forward and simple way. It's amazing how my children will ask questions after reading it that will then lead to more depth. I like that it doesn't contain questions for parents to ask or devotional type inserts because our conversations are genuine and not forced."
4,Wonderful resource!,I bought these Bibles for our Kindergarten and 1st Grade Sunday School classrooms. What a wonderful resource for the teachers. The Bible stories are both short and interesting enough to keep the children's interest. There are pictures on each page that bring the story to life for the children. Great buy!
5,Great kids bible,My kids had this bible growing up and I was so happy when my daughter requested this for her daughter for Christmas. It's a great kids bible book spanning generations. :)
5,Best beginners Bible I have found.,"The pictures are bright and colorful and there's not too much text on a page for a young reader. The stories are simplified, but generally capture the essence of the passage ( though far less graphic for young readers). The book contains a very good amount of Bible stories, unlike other children's Bibles that only seem to capture a few. the book also makes a great starting point for discussions if you have devotions with your young children."
4,"Great book to read with your ""new"" little readers",got the book on recommendation from our church and really enjoyed reading it to our boys 3 & 5 Y.O. the stories are about 3-5 pages long which is perfect for bed time or a brief read.
5,Highly Recommended #1 Children's Bible,My grand-daughter loves this book & so do I! I'm using this bible for our Children's Church & they listen attentively. They love the illustrations & they look forward to hearing the stories every Sunday.
3,Too easy,"I have 4 year old early reader. I got this bile for teaching him bible story and getting more supplemental readings. He read the first 56 pages the same day I gave to him. There was not even a single vocabulary for him. I ready through the rest didn't find and challenge words either. The content is to the simplest, there was not any help with developing comprehension skills. He does enjoy it though."
1,I agree. . .one of the worst books ever,"I agree. This book was HORRIBLE! It is not even about Kelly having a last chance, just her brush with bulimia. As a reader, I could not have cared about Trovato-Cantori's characters less. The author also tried to subtly sneak in her own political agenda, but was blatantly obvious. This book is so bad you can't even love to hate it. Definitely save your money!"
4,A title straight out of a WW2 newsreel!,"Fortunately the book doesn't live up to the sensationalist, and inaccurate, title. No pirates on these ships. Period.I found this to be an amazing read. Not too much technical detail, but a series of good stories all the more amazing in that this is not fiction. Easily read in an evening, but I recommend spreading it out to more fully digest the stories. Then, if still interested in the topic, I recommend reading the new book about SMS WOLF. ""Pirate Fleet"" glosses over several warships' cruises; ""WOLF"" is more in-depth from the perspective of crew and victims."
2,"A useful book but not a ""must have""","This is quite a useful addition to the naval history of WW2 inthat it covers in one volume all the German commerce raiders.To me the most interesting chapter was Chapter 7 Kormoran. As hesays its final battle with the cruiser HMAS Sydney remains asource of debate and controversy in Australia. Being wise afterthe event it amazes me that the Sydney approached so closelyan unidentified ship.Some gripes - on page 48 he refers to ""Brisbane Harbor"" -now I've lived in Brisbane , Australia most of my life and thereis no ""Brisbane Harbor"" as such - Brisbane is a river port.Also on page 112 he makes the nonsencical statement thatTasmania separated from New South Wales in 1901.In fact Tasmania was semi-autonomous in 1824 and a separatecolony on 1856.Perhaps I am a nit-picker but these two examples make me lackconfidence in other statements he makes which I cannot easilycheck from independent sources."
4,Hitler's Secret Pirate Fleet,An informative view of part of the Second World War. Spoiled in my opinion by inferior production in relation to print quality. Pictorial matter fair to unuseable. My Uncle was lost on the Ben Avon.
1,"Avoid this imitation, and get the real thing","I bought this a flea market stall selling old CDs. I read the track list, and it appeared to have some songs that I wanted to hear, so I bought it, waiting in anticipation until I could get home to listen to it. I wish had looked at the label at little more closely. This recording uses Buddy's original vocals, but apparently has substituted a group called the ""Picks"" for the instruments and back-up vocals. Most of the songs sound distinctly different than the original versions with the ""Crickets""; and most lack the sense of inspiration or passion that the originals have. You know an album is bad when some of the songs don't even have Buddy on them, and apparently were written sometime after his unfortunate death. Really hard-core collectors might want this as a novelty. Otherwise, I would say read the label carefully; avoid albums with this back-up band, and get the recordings with the original band."
3,Not a bad book,"I saw Rosie and Andrew on Oprah and I was excited about the book. I bought it the week it came out. The layout is attractive and the tidbits of healthful hints are great. I found, like other reviewers, recipes were time consuming, and some of the measurements were confusing. My favorite recipes are ""Santa Fe Chicken"", and ""Fish with Spinach En Papillote""."
2,Healthy Kitchen,The cook book was very disapointing. The only good thing about it was Andrew Weils tips that were scattered throughout the book. It should of been much better.
2,Riding Oprah's coattails,"The Healthy Kitchen has all the elements of a smartly packaged cash grab...The Healthy Kitchen is, basically, a general foods cookbook with very little to separate it from most other typical cookbooks. The problem lies in the fact that it is presented as being all about health (mind, body and spirit). The recipes and the book do not offer much insight into healthy living and the concept of a spiritual connection is virtually non-existent. the phrases ""healthy"" and ""mind. body and spirit"" are merely catch-phrases used to draw in a wider readership.I was hoping to get some more interesting writing or, at the very least, beautiful photography, but instead I got a typical cookbook with typical recipes and a tired, watered-down message.Rosie Daley has had her time in the spotlight..."
1,Look at the authors,Both authors look to be at least 20 pounds overweight. What does that tell you about their advice? Enough said.
3,"Great recipes, but many errors and omissions","I have made quite a few recipes from this book, and have found mistakes in almost all of them. It's as if nobody tested the recipes before the book was published. In one recipe the cooking time had to be almost doubled, in a recipe for muffins there was no mention of using any liquid (juice, milk, oil, etc.) to bind the ingredients together, and a recipe that was supposed to serve 6 people called for using 12 avocados. I have had to adapt most of the recipes because of this problem. I also found that the directions for preparation were sometimes vague. For example, the recipe would say to broil something for 3 minutes, but not tell you if that was total time or on each side. I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for the errors. Most of the recipes appealed to me and the commentary by Rosie and Dr. Weil was interesting to read. I suggest that they make corrections and reprint this book."
3,"Good Information, Poor Proofing",This is an excellent book -- full of great information ... the only problem is that all of the recipes I have tried so far are lacking something or have an error in the measurements. I am shocked that none of the other reviews have mentioned this. I have always found Dr. Weil's books to be interesting and informative and this book is no exception. Rosie Daley adds a delightful and educational point of view as well. This could be a great cookbook but I am frustrated with having to scrutinize each recipe. I would like to see this book reprinted with the correct recipes.
2,"Mediocre... good for healthy advice, bad for recipes.","Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?). However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed. A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great."
4,"less recipes than I hoped, but they all taste great,","This isn't an encyclopedic book of recipes. Just a couple of each category of cooking. Yet everyone that I have prepared is delicious. I especially enjoy the main course recipes--the chicken, salmon and tofu main course recipes are quick, healthy, and delicious!"
2,WHY ALL THE FAT?,"I was disappointed to read through this book.Several parts of the commentary on nutrition are already obsolete. My nutritionist which teaches a modified (some cooked)natural hygiene diet for healthy living was also disappointed--but she comments that compared to the average american's poor nutrient, high fat diet--these recipes are a step in the right direction.Further, many many of the recipes produce high fat meals. The recipes often call for many items that can be high allergan items--- gluten, dairy, eggs, soy. I had high hopes for this book- given the authors' high acclaim; but unless I give the book away, I will probably use the recipes for entertaining and high fat recreational meals, not daily living."
5,Excellent Cookbook!,"If you're looking for delicious tasting food that is also healthy for you, buy this book! Not only is it a cookbook but a health book as well --loaded with useful information from Dr. Weil and Rosie Daley. The recipes have flare and spice. The spices used in this book are recommended by Dr.Weil as they have many benefits to our health and healing process. I love them! My families favorite is the Roasted Winter Squash and Apple soup with Cilantro Walnut Pesto. Yum! You must try it..."
1,Healthy??,"The number of meat and dairy recipes in this book make the title an absolute misrepresentation. Chicken -- though most doctors aren't telling their patients this, and I don't know why Weil isn't either -- has as much saturated fat and cholesterol as beef -- even if the chicken is skinless. Shrimp (used for a few recipes) tops beef in terms of cholesterol, and dairy products are high up there in both saturated fat and cholesterol. If you want a healthy cookbook, try ""The Peaceful Palate"" by Jennifer Raymond -- easy, delicious, low-fat, and cholesterol-free. *That's* ""a healthy kitchen."""
2,flaws,"This book is beautifully done and I've enjoyed a lot of what I've read, but right now I'm following directions for the first recipe I've tried in it and it doesn't seem to be very well proof-read. The directions raise too many questions, too many things contradictory or unclear. It's a shame so much care was taken with the layout and appearance and not with making sure the recipes were correct."
4,Very healthy and easy book,"This is a very healthy and easy book. I have prepared MANY of its recipes and I know that they are delicious, nutritious and easy to make."
4,Interesting and deep...,"I was impressed with the book, it was a little more demanding than I had imagined. Nevertheless it provided a wonderful in depth exploration of the Sacrament of Marriage in the Orthodox Church, which like almost everything about Orthodox Christianity, reveals depths of meaning and spiritual insight in all its Liturgical practices, which are always there, when you take the time to drill down into the subject, in the manner which they deserve. As someone who is a convert to Orthodoxy from a Roman Catholic background , who recently was married in the Orthodox Church, I found it explored aspects of the Sacramental nature of marriage , its relationship to the Trinity, which I must be honest I had never heard explained in such depth in all my years in the Roman Catholic Church . I will be going back to it to chew over some of the deeper insights in future."
1,excellant example of sliabh luachra,i find that this cd lacks any musical substance or talent. The fiddle player is neither in tune or in tempo. I accept that this may be the typical style but in my opinion the term 'sliabh luachra'is an excuse for fiddlers who cannot play fast or in tune. Therefore Connie O'Connell is a perfect example of the Sliabh Luachra style.
1,Item being sold is not correct,The item which is being sold is not correct. I received 2 units trying to get the correct item and neither of these were correct. The unit in my breathalyzer has a green circuit board just as shown but the one sent has a red board and will not work in the unit.
5,This Celtic band is a force to be reckoned with.,It's a good thing that Solas decided to give the music business a go because the outcome is fine music making. Seamus Egan is an amazing talent with any woodwind and Karan Casey's crystal clear voice is the sugar topping to this very talented group of people. I have seen them here in Seattle and was quite pleased that the energy you hear on the album is translated and amplified when playing live. They are a breath of fresh air to the Celtic music scene.
1,H R Giger Cufflinks Anyone...?,"Alien was a great movie and all...but, come on...H R Giger is essentially nothing more than the Thomas Kincaid of grotesque dark fantasy. How many smoothly contoured robot babes slathered in amniotic fluid can you see before it just starts to seem DULL, DULL, DULL..."
2,Disappointing and Might Be Offensive to Some People,"After looking at the works featured in this book, I come to the conclusion that Giger is too obssesed with sex in his designs, to the stage of including porn (not art) in his work. Included in this book are sketches and drawings showing his designs are centered around sexual, skeletal, ""slender"", ""bloat"", ""mechanical screws"" themes. At times, I feel the artist is lacking in creativity (Yeah, I know he is a ""someone"" in the art world).Even before the section, Gigerotica, there are already pictures of female figures fitted with rubber phallus (pg 48, 49), engaging in sexual union. Other pages which might be ""offensive"" show group sex, oral sex, self-penetration, etc... Can't help but wonder, ""Isn't this more of porn that art"". I think it goes beyond erotic art.If everything in this book can be called art, then I suppose you can include any photo of people having sex called art as well."
1,Two words: It. Sucks.,"There is nothing more I can say other then it didn't work. When I bought it was told as long as I followed the directions closely I'd be fine. I read every single thing in the box many times over and did countless tests and it just never fired. There was not even a hint anything was going to happen every time I pushed the launch button.I had a group of kids with me ranging from Kindergarten to Jr. High and most of them were really disappointed, especially the 6 year old who's job it was to push the button... again and again and again and again.Don't buy this, and if you absolutely must, try it out yourself to make sure you can do it before sharing it with any kids."
5,it's the best toy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it's so cool!i love it! my baby brother also loves it,and he's only 4 years old.it's not loud,hard,and will not dent cars or break the glass!all kids,no matter what the age,will love it."
1,Don't buy it!,"It just doesn't work!I am 9 years old, and I spent my own money for this. My dad spent hours on the phone with customer support. It still doesn't work."
2,Rocket,The rocket is alright.It doesn't go up as far as the box said and sometimes wont go at all.The kids have fun with it anyway.
1,ROCKET SCHMOCKET,"We did everything and everything was working, hydrogen bubbling, tone sounded, buzzing while we push the button and 15 (yes 15) launch tones later we finally left the field in defeat. My son was in tears! I even doubled up on the citric acid and even at one point let the hydrogen fill the chamber TWICE risking an explosion as I have read about on other websites. I finally removed the rocket and sealed the chamber to see the igniter and guess what? Not igniting! After fighting with the estes phone service for 30 minutes I finally convinced her the igniter was not igniting. Told me a tech would call back and guess what NADA!NICE PIECE OF JUNK."
1,Things did not go as planned.....,"I believe I understood the directions well enough. New batteries, fill level, mixing of the fuel, o-rings, wait for tone..... but we tried over and over for a launch and got none! Quite a disappoinment to a 6 year old and definitely to a 38 year old as well. Will give it another try but not sure what I could have missed. Maybe rockets are best left to NASA."
3,Not for the Beginner,"Slipcover Magic is a complete book that includes many beautiful and detailed slipcover styles. I am at beginning stages of sewing--therefore I needed more detail explaining calculating yardage, pin fitting, and construction techniques. For a more experienced seamstress this is probably a great resource. However, I felt that it lacked the simple details I needed in order to proceed with my basic slip cover project. Simple Slipcovers by Sunset provided the basic detail I was looking for."
3,It's not what you think it is,"Most people (12 and up) look at Pokemon and say YUK. I know that's what I did (I'm 14), But I was shopping for my sister (big pokemon fan). So i decided to look at the song list (cause she is one room over from me, so i can hear the music from my room) to see if it was any good and as i was skimming the artists I relized my sister would hate this cd, but me and my friends would like it alot. there's *N Sync and Britney Spears all the music my sister hates but i like. So if you like that kind of stuff get the CD. It's not just another Pokemon thing. Take my word for it, i hate Pokemon and I really liked the CD."
2,How can they call this a soundtrack?,"I was extremely disapointed with this title. The worst words you can see on a CD case are, ""Music from and INSPIRED by the movie."" I purchased the soundtrack in hopes of listening to the composed music that was in the movie. I.E. when Ash comes marching through the smoke with all of the pokemon behind him. I can only hope that Nintendo will eventually release a full musical SCORE from the film."
2,"Personally, I won&#65533;t say I loved it even if I knew them!","Story finished, I think ""Brother, My Brother"" is the best on here. I don't know about the rest, and that Britney Spears song should've never been included!"
4,Gotta catch this one,Don't miss this one - especially if you are a dance teacher or teach recreational dance. Great music for ages 5 - 10 - especially track 1 and 14. The rest of the CD is great.Lisa
3,you like teen dance-pop?....buy this cd,"it's really easy with this cd....if you're a light dance-pop lover you'll probably love this cd....if you're a teen pop hater, don't even try it! if you're kind of in the middle like i am, give it a try....some songs are good enough, and some others just suck. ""we're a miracle"" by Christina Aguilera is a very tipical ballad, but her voice is just amazing....other than that you won't find any other great talent here."
3,It's okay,"I only liked a few songs on this. Christina Aguilera, Emma Bunton, Aaron Carter, and my favourite, Billie! Well, her song anyway. I heard that lots of people diss the song but I love it."
5,good pop songs,"I bought this CD for one reason and one reason only, for the NSYNC song...and believe me if any of you out there LOVE NSYNC then BUY THIS! I have not been able to find this song ANYWHERE else and the song ""Somewhere Someday"" is sooooo beautiful it shows everybody out there that the guys in NSYNC are extremely talented and have great voices. This proves that someday we will be talking about NSYNC like we talk about artists like Boyz II Men, and others.....BUY it if you love them...its worth it!"
5,Well Done,"This Cd was well done. I bought it and really liked 90% of the songs. The songs really have something to do with the movie. If you saw the movie, you would know which song is for which part of the movie. I like this Cd alot and listen to it often. It Rocks!"
4,A pretty good C.D.,"I think that if they wouldn't of had some of the songs it would have been better. For example, Soda Pop, what does that have to do with the movie?? I loved this song, but Don't Say you Love me was also misplaced, the movie wasn't about romance, even between Ash and Misty. Overall though, the good songs outweighed the bad. I really liked...#1 I liked the new style of the theme song#2 Even though it has nothing to do with the movie it is still a very catchy song.#7 This could be considered a pick up song. If you're in a bad mood, just pop this C.D. into the C.D. player.#10 I loved the lyrics and the beat of it!!!#11 One of my Favorites, this song has a carefree attitude to it. It's really fun to dance to!!This is a great C.D. recommended for all Pokemon fans!!!"
4,!!!,"I'm not really a fan of Pokemon. My brother's majorly obsessed, and he brought this soundtrack. I must say that I totally didn't expect it to be so good. Highlights include:Don't Say You Love Me - M2M, We're A Miracle - Christina Aguilera, Makin' My Way (Anyway That I Can) - Billie Piper, Free Up Your Mind - Emma Bunton (although it can get a little annoying with continuous listening), If Only Tears Could Bring You Back - Midnight Sons.The only downside is Britney Spears, N SYNC, and Mandah."
2,Don't Say You Love Me,"My younger sister got this Cd because she loves Pokemon. I listened to it and truly almost all the songs are sung by whiny teenagers(ex: Aaron Carter, Ashley Ballard), and people that think they are still teenagers (ex: NSync, Vitamin C, Emma Bunton). In other words they suck. But I love M2M's song Don't Say You Love Me. They really have a lot of talent,(even though I don't think they wrote the song) especially for their age, and they are not annoying like most teen pop artists(ex: Britney Spears, Christina Aguielera, Aaron Carter). I am going to order their M2M's single now. I hope they continue singing."
3,"Pokemania, not for me","I just hate that film, well I know it's made for kids. But the dc is ok. If you like Emma Bunton like me buy this CD. The other song are not that good. Britheney Spear really sing bad."
3,Cash Cow,"When I first purchased this soundtrack, I knew what to expect. A lot of pop songs that have nothing to do with Pokemon, and maybe a few catchy tunes. That's all that I got. I never expected it to be something amazing, or something spectacular. It pretty much was just a way to make money. They could of easily wrote songs that have to do with the movie's theme or Pokemon itself, but they decided to be lazy and release old songs that were lying around on the cutting room floor. Why? Because Pokemon was big and could sell easily. This soundtrack sold 2 million copies alone. It's insane, yet amazing. So don't buy this expecting wonderful tunes or anything. Just buy it as if you were buying a Now CD or something."
1,Corporate Butchering,"I have nothing against Pokemon at all and I think that the first movie Mewtwo Strikes Back is (or was) extremely well-done. However why the fools that dubbed it decided to add a teenybopper soundtrack and COMPLETELY ruin the mood of the movie is anyone's guess. I guess it'd draw in more socially vulnerable kids that way - typical corporate America if you ask me. Mewtwo Strikes Back is about the great question of existance itself and is a very dark movie indeed, and this nice cheerful soundtrack makes it much more difficult to appreciate that this is the case."
1,Not a happy customer,It took several weeks to receive my order and then when it did arrive it was the wrong thing! Now I'm trying to figure out how to get a hold of the company to let them know.
4,"O.K. SOUNDTRACK,BUT GOOD ARIST","POKEMON THE FIRST MOVIE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD . MY FAVORITE TRACK IS BILLIE'S ""MAKIN' MY WAY"" AND CHRISTINA AGUILERA ""WE'RE A MIRCLE"" AND M2M ""DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME"" . BRITNEY SPEARS AND NSYNC ARE GOOD TO AND EVER THINK IS CHILDISH ."
5,Awesome!,This CD is so fun and catchy! I listen to it every chance I get! One of my favorite Pokemon CD's!
4,Pokemania,This cd is a good cd for young kids. It is a 4 star because it has really good singers and the songs are pretty good. I would say that kids older then 12 probaly won't like it.
3,"Half good, half bad.","Songs #2, 3, 10, 15, and 16 were the only good ones on the CD. The rest, I generally SKIPPED. #16 is the best, if only the world would listen to this one eh? I'm rather glad there was only two actually 'pokemon' themed songs on the disk, it's more tolerable that way. If you like the pop scene, sure why not. If not, steer VERY CLEAR."
5,Don't forget to tag your bags!!!,"""Traveling Hopefully"" is an inspiring self help book but it is also a great resource for general life management. My favorite tool is ""Tagging Your Baggage"" - turning the negative labels that have attached themselves to you, into positive ones. For years my family called me a ""Motor Mouth"" but with the help of ""Traveling Hopefully"" I now think of myself as a ""Great Communicator."" I highly recommend this book to anyone who aims to better understand themself and the world in which they live."
4,Calling My Mother,"This book is about Lewis Grizzard's life and how he wished he could call his mother. In his childhood, he loved his mom, but after growing up, he learned just how much she instilled in his life. He married three times and died divorced.One of his problems is that he wanted all of his problems is that he wanted all of his wives to be just like his mother, even in their cooking. He was too picky and did not seem to care much about his relationship with his wives. He never put much into it."
3,Great music,"The music and sound quality is great, the CD is brand new but the case was damaged. Hope this does not happen often to other customers."
2,Field piano music,"One must have a desire to hear Field's music to own this. Field was, to my thinking, a lesser composer and these perfomances demonstrate that."
5,We Love the Wild Kratts,"The wild Kratts are great! These make it fun to learn about the animals. Every time we watch (and it's a lot) I learn some new things about the animals, so I'm shore my kids are doing the same thing. It is great for the kids, and mom doesn't mind watching the brothers. If your kids enjoy these they might like Wild Kratts: Creature Adventures and/or Wild Kratts: Predator Power and/or Zoboomafoo. :)"
1,Full of inaccurate information,"Many of the figures quoted in this book about success rates of birth control and the like are in error. While abstaining from sex is the only fool-proof birth control method, giving teens incorrect information will make them doubt the usefulness of protection even if they do decide to have sex, creating a dangerous situation for all involved."
5,The Ultimate OS/400 Security Guide,"This is quite simply the definitive work todate on securing your iSeries computer system. This book addresses key business security problems and provides not only the technical data but the rationale behind alternative implementations.I have recently been reviewing our company's security implementation in light of Sarbanes Oxley. This book has helped has been a tremendous help. This book explains what actually happens when you select a security option.I also like the writing style of this book. It doesn't matter whether you are an iSeries expert or novice, the advice and recommendations will enable anyone to secure their system and meet their unique requirements."
3,"Prefer the ""Storytellers"" version","Having listened to ""Unplugged"" and watching the televised event on MTV, I much prefered her special on VH1's ""Storytellers"". To bad it's not available in either audio or video. ""Unplugged"" isn't arranged as well as ""Storytellers"", but I do prefer the slower renditions as compared to her CD's."
3,Unplugged To Early,"It was way to early for Alanis to do an Unplugged, not enough material to back her up. The high points of this album are the songs No Pressure (that she performed during her '95/'96 tour)and the cover of King of Pain. You Learn, Ironic, and That I Would Be Good sound flat, she messes up during the second chorus in Joining You, Princes Familiar and These R the Thoughts were written for SFIJ but were left off, and for good reason. The two songs do not hold up well and should stay B-side material, they have no place here. Songs like You Oughta Know, I was Hoping and Head Over Feet were already released live/ acoustic for B-sides and were performed with much more emotion. Over all, the album is alright, but nothing special. Great for Alanis Fans, but I cant see this bringing anyone new into her audience."
2,Anemic and Inebriated,"What happened? I know Alanis can sound great live. I was lucky enough to have 3rd row center seats during her SFIJ tour. Beautiful voice! Such raw energy, jumping and twirling, swinging those long braids while playing fantastic harmonica. But here, it's a different story. In ""You Learn"" she sounds anemic and inebriated, slurring many words. And she totally butchers ""Ironic"". ""You Oughta Know"" is OK, but doesn't have the intensity of her live performance at the Grammy's. ""Uninvited"" is a soulful version, too bad it's spoiled by mike noise. The one saving grace is ""Joining You"", that's an example of Alanis at her best. Too bad the other tracks aren't."
4,A nice live album for when you want something different,"I bought this album last week, and have played it a lot since. I like Alanis' music a lot, and I must say that this live album is very nice indeed. The live versions of Head Over Feet, You Learn, I Was Hoping and That I Would Be Good are a joy for the ear, and especially You Oughta Know is wonderful on this album. As for the new songs, I especially enjoy Princess Familiar - can't get it out of my head. The only two songs I do not enjoy as much here are Ironic and Uninvited. I love the originals, but the live versions lack ""something"". But in all, a great purchase...."
4,Good Album; Production a little distracting,"I love acoustic albums and this one is no different. However the one major flaw I have this particular recording is in the echo and reverb throughout the album. I don't know if it was the location of the recording or maybe there was a new guy doing the mic setup or what, but the echo on two or three of the tracks here was so bad that it really took away from the enjoyment of listening. Again nothing wrong on Alanis's part as far as I figure, just a not so great production effort."
5,Alanis at her best (possibly),"Unplugged is Alanis at her best. The more I listened to it the more I liked it. I was used to some of the songs sounding different from the studio recordings of them, but I quickly grew to love how she arranged and sung them on this album much more.One exception is ""You oughta know"", the original version is filled with more energy and raw emotion."
3,My lover is making me write this....,"Hi...I wouldn't really call myself an Alanis fan, but my lover is, and he had some insights that he wanted to share...>> ""That I Would..."" justifies buying this album. ""Queen of Pain"" is the bonus. The Unplugged audience seems ""canned"" and seems to have been enhanced during post-production, and this detracts from the simulated ""live"" experience. (Listen for the tell-tale ""WHOO-HOO"" at the end of each track.) That's about it. If you like Alanis, buy it. If you've never bought an album by Alanis, take a ""Jagged Little Pill"" first. <<"
5,A solid release ... a solid performance,"The editorial review at the top of this page is WRONG. This is a great CD. I'm listening to it now and am in a trance. And the performances of ""Princes Familiar"" and ""Uninvited"" are wonderful additions. ""Uninvited"" is probably her strongest performance to date. Strongly recommended."
5,"Alanis Delivers,Again","Just like in her plugged cd's,Alanis once again gives the best thing she has: her voice. the songs picked for this CD seems to bring u into the right mood that closes with maybe her best song yet, Uninvited. Even ""hard core"" songs like You Oughta Know gets a soft touch and it seems Alanis is more interesting in getting her words out than to scream them so all the ppl will hear her, but then again is there someone who doesn't know the lyrics to this 90s classic? The storytelling songs from the Junkie CD comes out even better in their unplugged version, and the unreleased songs maybe not be her very best, they r still Alanis songs, which says it all"
5,"SIMPLY AMAZING, BRILLIANT","This album is in fact the best live album ever made. It is truly brilliant and amazing. Some of my favorites are ""Princes Familiar,"" ""King Of Pain"" (police cover), ""No pressure over cappuccino"" ""That I Would Be Good"" and ""I was Hoping"" This album is beautiful. Alanis is the queen of music, and it shows!"
5,"For A Lighter Look At Morrisette ""This"" is the One :)","This compulation from Morrisette shows a much lighter approach to the powerful thrusting bounds that usually exist in her voice. While Fans aren't displeased with the power this artist usually exerts this album tends to show a tender interpretation of Alanis' music and the power of her lyrics sneak up on you without warning. For the ""true"" Morrisette Fan this is a Must!"
2,A disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this disc, as I have enjoyed Alanis' previous live material - such as her acoustic version of ""You Oughta Know"" from the Grammy's several years back, and more recently, her performance of ""Uninvited."" I've seen her live in concert twice, and she put on an amazing performance both times. Here, however, her vocals seem flat and lifeless, particularly on ""Ironic"" and ""You Learn,"" which should have been the stand-out tracks of the album. Her cover of the Police's ""King of Pain"" isn't half-bad, nor is ""You Oughta Know,"" but overall, a major disappointment."
2,Great if you're an Alanis fan,"I will still recommend Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie in stead of Jagged Little Pill or this MTV Unplugged.The good thing is, Alanis moderates her exaggerated semi-angry singing of her older songs on this bootleg.The less good thing is, this takes the soul out of her better songs as well.And becomes a plain performance, without any heights. Though pleasant enough for Alanis fans."
1,very bad,without the studio polish she sounds flat and the words are just there without any merit.how she blew up in the first place is over my head in the first place.she was more catchy doing the Paula Abdul thing.she should stick to something lite and stay in the studio.
2,I dont think so,This album shouldnt be made by alanis . Alanis is not as mature as Eric Clapton. This album proves this. Her flute performance was totally a tragedy. And all the impression I have is her bare foot.
5,Another great Sonny Fortune performance!,"If you haven't been listening to Sonny Fortune's own releases since the first on the old A&M Horizon label, you have missed one of the better post-bop alto players of the day. Sonny's work shows a love of both Cannonball and Coltrane, as his bright tone on alto merges with the keening wail of Trane to shadow his luminescent playing with a profound sense of hope. Fortune is a very powerful player, as his deft handling of the tenor on this recording emphasizes. His tenor playing is resonant of Trane, but with his own sense of space and discipline. The soprano playing on this album is also terrific, and the trio of John Hicks(one of the greats!), Santi Debriano, and Ronnie Burrage play brilliantly with Fortune. Try to find the Bluenote release ""From Now On"" also, especially for the tracks with Joe Lovano and Eddie Henderson."
1,HA HA HA - WHAT IS THIS THING???,"What a creepy something (sorry, it doesn't deserve to be called ""a movie"").I would like to learn the IQ of people who stand behind this ""project"". How unimaginative one must be to create such dreary picture.Where is sense in all that bull*#*#*??? The dialogues are nothing. Just like acting and direction. Even the ""sex"" scenes made me laugh loud!!!Check so called ""first lady"" - this is a true proof how stupid it is. She is twice as old as her ""husband"" - Mr. President. And all the viewers must believe that they are a married couple...HA HA HA!"
3,Classic 1950s television,"Four classic Christmas tales are featured on this collection; each tale was originally produced for television in the 1950s. The collection begins with ""The Adventures of Long John Silver: The Orphans' Christmas,"" in which Miss Purity and Long John Silver demonstrate their kindness by helping a group of orphans enjoy the holiday season. ""Annie Oakley: Santa Claus Wears A Gun"" follows, telling the story of a Santa Claus lookalike who is accused of armed robbery. Next up, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Christmas Goose"" sees Robin and his merry bunch of men trying to save a cute little goose from ending up on the Christmas dinner table. Then, completing the collection, ""The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel: The Christmas Present"" tells the story of four children trapped in a house in France, who are desperate to make it back to their native England for the holiday season."
1,"not fit well,leak in every join,too quiet.","do not fit well ,leak in every join ,too quiet,you have to welded for not leak.i do not recommend it ,i am really disappoint."
2,ugh,"I really was looking forward to reading this book, but I was very disappointed by it. I didn't find the writing very good or the story that compelling. And there are a couple of spots where there are typos or misuse of grammer.As a current resident of Westfield, the setting for the book, I did enjoy reading about the town. And that kept me reading it."
5,fun fun fun!!,loved it! read it twice! something is always happening in this book. i love LOVE tara the curb owl! so cool!
1,Don't waste your money,"The photography and sound are amateurish. The plot focuses mainly on a badly-acted religious conservative role that occupies way too much of the movie. The characters are gay, but the movie lacks any attractiveness."
2,Stole my time...,"The major problem with this film is that the audio is bearly. It,of course, doesn't help that I have airplanes flying over my residence every 30 seconds (I live near LAX). Because the audio is barely there, I have to turn the tv up to high just to hear any dialogue. The producers obviously didn't shell out big bucks for the making of this film and so the majority of the ""actors"" are probably freshmen film students or friends of the director/producer/writer/star. If it weren't for the brief sex scene, this would have been a total waste of time. I definately will be putting this in the ""Amoeba"" bin so that I can get something out of this since I can't get my stolen time back."
3,Not as good as the coment already posted,"Basically, this book is not as good as for teaching use. I don't like the style of how the author state or arrange the topic. A lot confusion. But for those who have stronger math ground, it may be a not bad reference. The most point where I dispointed is the example or the solution of the excise is too abstract. The detailed induction, proof, explaination is especially importantant for beginner.So use this book as a reference.Don't choose as text book. Hard to follow!!!!"
1,Do not buy this book,This book is being used as a text book in one of my graduate level classes. The book is dificult to read. It is down right torture to get through this book. This person obviously cannot write and needs to hire a technical writer to proof his work. The class is petitioning the professor to not use this book in the future. So I bought a $74 dollar paper weight.
5,REAL gardening gloves for women!,These are my second pair [the first went 1.5 years a record for me!] These gloves are truely made for WORKING in your garden...not just repotting [though their great for that too!] I have been putting in an orchard and have tons of perennials so I really give them a work-out. Most gloves are too large or wear out in a few weeks. These fit [my smaller to avg hands] and even protect finger nails!!!! I'll never buy others.
3,Good gloves but not for heavy usage,"These are nice looking gloves. That aside, they fit and breathe well enough. I would have given them 4 stars except that in 2.5 weeks, the index fingers wore through and exposed my finger. It may not be fair to expect gloves such as these to last longer with heavy usage (five days a week, about 4 hours of wear each day), so I offer 3 stars. If you aren't going to use them as much as I did, I would consider them for purchase."
2,Medium is also very small,"They tell you to measure the width of your hand to pick a size. Based on that I'm a medium, but the fingers of the gloves are way too short for an average hand."
4,Perfect for light gardening,"After years of wearing cheap gardening gloves from the local home store, I decided to spring for a higher quality pair and I am very pleased that I chose this product. I do light gardening: mostly weeding, light pruning, annual planting, and tending to the potted plants on my porch and patio. I have small hands and the medium sized gloves fit perfectly. The velcro closure at the wrist keeps them nice and snug. The (burgundy) fabric on the back of the hands is stretchy so that the gloves have good flexibility and are comfortable to wear. Most important for me: the (black) fabric on the palm side of the gloves and fingertips is thick enough that I no longer get stab wounds from the holly leaves my neighbor's tree drops in my yard!"
2,Poor Quality,"The sizing chart on the web page does not reflect the actual size of the gloves. I first assumed the sizing might be correct and that I had to wear the gloves until they stretched a bit, I now assume otherwise. Upon first use of the gloves the fabric began separate and several long threads came lose in areas were tension from the gloves being to small was not an issue. I like the style and overall design of the glove but it did come with some flaws."
4,Great But Run Small,"These are great gloves, very durable, has a nice Velcro strap at the top to secure them snugly about the wrist. I bought mine for my emergency kit. They are very durable the only thing to keep in mind is they run small. I have very thin hands and the medium fits me just about perfect where normally I would need a small or even extra small. I'm glad I listened to the reviewers they were correct about the sizing so be sure to buy one size up. I also have long fingers but the medium gave me a good fit all around.It is nice to find a nice rugged pair of ladies gloves that just plain work great and last. I highly recommend them."
1,Terrible,I didn't even get the bag that I wanted. They sent me a sub bag with a $30 dollar discount. The $30 dollars was enough for tax and shipping fees. It took almost a month to get to me. I had faith in amazon but after that amazon is just another site to order stuff from.
