4,Great product,"I have very dark circles under my eye. Timebalm is one of the few brands that carry concealers in a range of colors that actually work well with my skin tone. I love this product and it has provided the best coverage for my under eye area. It usually lasts all day. It does however get cakey after a few hours, and does not contain any sunscreen to prevent darkening of the under eye. Apart from that, I have been using this for years and will probably continue."
5,Great product!!,"I have been using this concealer for over 8 years. Found it at sephora and it has been my daily go to ever since! I live a busy lifestyle and I am not able to you touch up my makeup throughout the day. I put this concealer on in the morning under my eyes and thats it! I've always had circles due to my olive skin tone and this product makes my eyes look bright, not cakey with makeup. Also if you brush on undereye powder along with this product, it'll look even more natural. My ONLY negative is that Ulta and Sephora do not sell it at their stores anymore, so you have to order online. I highly recommend!!"
4,I like it,"Ive had pretty bad dark circles for some time now. And I've used all of the concealers that are in local stores(Kroger, Walmart etc.) ALL of them suck, especially the liquid kind. I will definitely continue to buy this product. Just make sure to use moisturizer before applying or else it will look caked."
4,Concealer,"I have REALLY bad under eye circles, I use this in a part of my ""Under Eye Circle Cover Up Routine."" My mom bought it for her but the ""Light"" was too dark for her.I use Nyx concealer in Yellow, LA minerals concealer in Cinderella Yella, and Time balm in Light for my under eye circles."
4,Concealer Works Well,"I'm a 1st time user of this product and it works well. Absolutely nothing on earth covers dark circles completely short of surgery (to correct the gravity drop of the eyes). Botox helps your forehead and lifts your brows up again, but unless you have ""the surgery"" the undereyes have the darkness. Tried numerous products to lighten, brighten, and make claims. The Balm Time Balm is great. After my undereye moisturizer I apply it under and around the eyes, and then foundation and it blends. Also works well to conceal other skin spots. Thumbs up!"
5,This one is my favorite!,"I been using for a while and I like it.Has nice shades,very natural ,covers good ,and blends good.Some other ones always would have to much of face pink look to it, but not this one."
4,I've been looking for something like this for years....,"I bought this concealer on a whim, and now I can't be without it. I have very dark circles under my eyes. Nothing ever covered them enough without looking obvious. TimeBalm completely covers my circles, and looks just like my skin at the same time. No ""reverse-raccoon"" eyes anymore! And once you put it on, it stays until you wipe it off. The only thing I wish is that it moisturized a little more, and maybe had some sunscreen in it. Then it would be totally perfect for me."
4,Great all-purpose concealer,"It helps to cover my super serious dark circle, the redness around my nose and sometimes break-outs. I have light-medium skin tone and choose the lightest color and it works perfect. However, you have to moisturize your skin well before put it on. Otherwise it will be too dry (especially for areas around the eyes) and fine lines might show!"
2,"Ok, but not that great","I just recently started noticing my eyes getting darker underneath. I don't know if it's due to stress, age, lack of sleep or a little bit of everything. So, I started researching the best cover ups cause the cover girl concealer stick was not working at all anymore. Found this product with pretty good reviews. Decided to try it even though it was expensive only cause I had a amazon gift card. When I opened it at first I thought omigod it's tiny for $18. I really didn't think it would be that small; it's like the size of a half dollar, maybe smaller and only an inch high. Anyway I am not that pleased with the results. I wouldn't even consider my eyes that dark yet just dark enough to bother me. But I use this concealer and my old cover girl stick concealer in order to get coverage that I am ok with for now. I don't think I would purchase this product again only cause it was expensive and works just ok. It was worth it for the $3 after my coupon though. :)"
5,Great for Cancer Patients,"I started out my life with dark circles under my eyes, and during breast cancer my chemo only made it worse. Any woman who has had chemo knows the potential skin changes. My then concealer just would not stick to my skin properly, and in no way could have gotten rid of my raccoon eyes.Time balm will stay on skin that other makeup does not. The benefit of a moisturizer was great for my chemo skin. This makeup helped me to look fairly normal during treatment, which was a big emotional boost.Now I am cancer free, but still use timebalm as a concealer and a moisturizer."
2,Just another concealer,"I had high expectations for this concealer given the great reviews and high price tag. I ordered light but realized that was not light enough - this has a bit of pinkish/brown tones and is a bit heavy for my pale complexion with red undertones. I did find even with the color difference, it blended well. Anyways, my undereye circles have become more and more prominant and figured this would do the trick. Even after applying two layers with a brush, this was no better than store concealers. I've been sticking with Neutrogena 3 in 1 and Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Erase Dark Cirles. The combination of both (yes, I need layers and layers) tends to do the trick for now until I can come across something that is better."
4,"NOT THE BEST UNDERGROUND DISCO, BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SEASONED COLLECTORS.","Joey negro's first installment in the Soul of disco series may not be the most pulsating underground disco music you'll hear, but the quality is very good if not great. There are some standouts in the mix such as ""Happy"", and ""My baby Knows"", but if you want something that'll get the blood flowin', check out better anthologies from Salsoul, Larry Levan, Tom Moulton, etc."
4,The Alice Book,"I googled ""The Alice Book, databases"", and nothing came out, so I'm fixing mostly this part in my review.In a word, if you are a DBA, you don't need this book and won't be able to understand 99% of it, but if you are database theoretician, this book is on your bookshelf already.This book quite complete review of relational database science as of 1995. In many cases, when studying particular subject I get away with original research papers available at citeseer and elsewhere, but often I find that it's much quicker just to open the Alice book at the right place."
4,A good theory book but meaningless for engineers,"It is a good DB theory book for professors and students. It covers most topics in data models and database theories. But it is not suitable to be a textbook, and should be avoided by IT engineers in industry. The book is hard to read. There are too many maths elements in it. Compared with the discontinued book by Ullman, its English is not good, maybe because the first author is French."
5,Brilliant...,"I am giving the series five stars, the Facets transfer 2.5 or 3, and the Polish WB transfer 4.5.Along with Scenes from a Marriage, Fanny and Alexander, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Firefly, Kieslowski's and Piesiewicz's Dekalog is one of the supreme achievements of television (well, cinematic) art. To see it in all its glory get an all region DVD player and buy the Polish WB edition. It is, as DVD Beaver notes, vastly superior to the Facets edition for sale here. You can, by the way, see this difference at DVD Beaver. The Polish edition while not perfect looks excellent and is likely as good as this brilliant series is going to look."
5,To think,"These movies will make you think on the very important things of your life: not only God, but also your family, friends, trust and lies, love, justice...I strongly recommend them to everybody. It doesn't matter if you are a believer or not. It matters if you do think and feel or not.Personally, I liked No. 1 and No. 5 the most."
5,A Soul-Stirring MASTERPIECE...,"...The Decalogue is a shining example of what great cinema can be: PROFOUND. THOUGHT PROVOKING. INSPIRING.At once simple and complex, these films are compelling and evocative on every level: visually, emotionally, intellectually, psychologically, spiritually.When I watch these ten films, I feel they ask for--and reward--my complete and continuous attention. They engage my whole being. I feel my truest, most authentic Self rise up to meet these films at THEIR level--and it's a thrilling experience. Several of the stories held me almost breathless as they unfolded, then left me in a kind of stunned silence at their conclusion. I have experienced this stunned silence many times before, always in the presence of great Art."
5,Gift from heaven,"All Kieslowski fans. Consider this a gift from heaven. Up until this release, the only way for the US fans to obtain this set was to buy bootlegged copies and let this masterpiece be destroyed by fuzzy picture and sound quality result of PAL-NTSC conversion. I paid about $70 for a set of Decalogue on VHS tapes. This is something not to miss. Definitely grab a copy before it goes out of print."
1,Possible DVD problems,"GREAT FILMS, but my DVDs don't run properly on my iBook. Every other DVD I have works fine, but these are jumpy and don't work. Maybe it's an encoding problem, but buyers should be warned: if you plan on watching these on a computer (or at least an iBook), they might not work."
1,A dictionary without vowels,"One of the web sites shows sample screen views, which show that this dictionary does not display vowel points or Hebrew pronunciation, making it useless to a non Hebrew-fluent user."
2,Wrong vac bags,The bags I received do not fit my vacume.I had to alter them to make them work. I will NOT be ordering any more from this company. We also have trouble getting Amazon to keep the charges seperate from the two Kindels in our acct.One is mine the other is my sisters but both were purchased with my computer because my sister does not have one.The books we buy sould be charged to differant credit cards but some how all were being charged to my Visa.I talked to a very nice lady in Wash. named Katty wewill see if she has got it fixed when we get our next Visa bill.So far I'm not impressed with Amazon.
3,so so,"I need to write a long letter or review on this item - it does what it does - I would purchase it again, but that is because I had a dislocted thumb - it is so so"
2,Not sturdy,I used this just a few days in occupational therapy for my broken wrist. It tore up after a few days. I can't recommend it.
2,It worked well until it broke,"In only the first couple of weeks a tear appeared between two holes. From the start, there were visible tiny holes in the material which would cause a tear to originate. I'd imagine the latex one would have held up better.It is still usable despite the tear but I would go with the latex one if I had to purchase it again. It's cheaper too."
5,Outstanding results,"I've finished my first bag of this cocoa powder and I'm absolutely pleased with the results. I have two favorite chocolate recipes, one for cookies and one for brownies, and the difference is definitely noticeable. This isn't just my bias because I know I put expensived cocoa powder into the recipe; other people comment on the rich chocolate flavor. I haven't yet tried this cocoa powder with a recipe I have for Schweddy balls but I'm sure they'll come out great...already no one can resist my Schweddy balls."
3,Weak and Wimpy,"I just purchased this product. I normally use Valrhona Cocoa Powder but a couple days ago they were out. Every morning we (my wife and I) each have a cup of espresso that I make at home. I add 1 tablespoon of a mixture of sugar and cocoa powder (1 cup sugar to 1 tablespoon cocoa) to each cup. The result is a heavy deep richly flavored coffee that lasts perfectly in my memory until the next morning. Aside from the obvious visual differences (Valrhona is darker, black not red) the Valrhona is simply much better with deeper chocolate tones of earth, fruit and strength. Now I say all this recognizing that taste is a personal thing and that others may disagree, but the Callebaut is definately weaker and wimpier. Today Amazon again has Valrhona and I reordered this morning."
4,OK,"This was a top rated cocoa. I used it in my homemade hot cocoa recipe. The taste was good, but I would not purchased it again."
3,"Better than some, but not great","I have used every brand of cocoa available. Some of the best (and cheapest) I've used are A&P's Master Choice Premium and the no longer available Hersey's European Style with the silver label. I prefer dutch processed cocoa and found Callebaut was not quite as good as Bensdorf, available from King Arthur Flour online."
2,"Great cocoa powder, but bad packaging by sender",I have ordered this item twice now cause the 1st box arrived & the bag had broken & exploded all over the box. SO I returned it & ordered a replacement only to have it arrive in the same condition.
5,Very flavorful!,"I've been making a simple hot cocoa recipe to try various cocoa powders, and I hadn't found one that impressed me until I tried the Callebaut powder. The flavor is rich, deep, and complex. Plus, the powder is very fine, and it dissolved well in hot water/milk.Note: When I ordered it, it was ""Prime Eligible, fulfilled by Amazon."" Right now, it's not eligible, which increases the cost by almost 40%. But I'd still probably pay for it, because this stuff is so much better than the competition."
5,Amazing!!!,I ordered this to make some special cakes. Prior to using this I used a supermarket brand that I thought made a pretty good chocalate cake. WOW was I mistaking! I just can't go back! Excellent taste! No bitterness just a very smooth rich chocalate flavor. Using this in your recipes will take them to the next level.
1,Easily Broken,I read reviews about Sky Mounti Inclinometer saying that it was easily broken while tightening the screws. These reviews were correct. I was very careful knowing that the mounting system was fragile. It is truly fragile I don't recommend this product.
5,Dogs Love To Please,"Clearly a must-have for anyone who desires to have a win-win relationship with their dog. I was surprised how quickly my dogs responded to her suggestions. The insights offered in Dogs Love To Please are positive and helpful. I've used this information for my older dogs and a new puppy. Stop being frustrated and begin to ""understand"" your dog. You'll learn to communicate with your dog in a way THEY understand. I believe in this book so strongly, I've given it as a gift many times."
4,Very decent daytime watch,"- Smaller than I expected.+ The second hand lines up on the tick marks about half the time. This is better some 200 dollar Swiss watches.+ For 50 bucks it comes with a sapphire crystal.+ For 50 bucks it comes with a screw down crown- The lume is bad. Since the numbers have more lume than the hands, the numbers much brighter than the hands at night. This makes it hard to read the time at night.- Strap is pretty lousy. It irritated my skin, frays easily, and dries slowly. I replaced it with a cheap leather strap.+ Pretty accurate since it's a quartz.+ Not too loud for me.+ Pretty light and comfortable on the wrist.This watch got confused for a Hamilton which is a always a good thing for something that can be had for 50 bucks."
2,"Another ""you get what you pay ...""","The watch itself is nice looking considering the price. Nice size, details, etc. The band was replaced immediately as the original was quite cheap looking/quality but that wasn't much of a problem.The big negative however is that I've had the watch for only a month or so and it continuously has condensation/drops of water under the crystal. The watch is supposed to be water resistant up to 200 meters. I think I've worn it washing dishes at the extreme. Disappointing despite the price."
2,"Not as advertised, but an ""OK"" watch","Thought it would be a 200m watch, but read reviews AFTER ordering. It's only a 100m watch, but would probably deal with more than just swimming and snorkeling since it does have a screw-down crown (with O-ring) and screw-down back. Just seemed ""cheaper"" than I expected?"
1,Not a winner,"I bought this watch as an everyday wear watch. Within the first day I noticed it was loosing about ten minutes of time in every 24 hours. I reset it several times and even changed the battery but it still looses time. I attempted to contact the manufacturer via email but they never responded. I really wanted to like this watch because of its simple classic styling, but I am disappointed by its poor functioning and the fact that the manufacturer doesn't seem to care."
4,Great Amazon Seller,"My ordered arrived quickly and undamaged. There was a description disparity with the 5 pack Miele bag advertised which only contained 4 bags. I contacted the seller, and Mr. Witbeck responded personally and quickly with his explanation and an apology. The seller offered to ship me the 5th bag, and the very next day a new box containing 4 more bags arrived. The seller went above and beyond the call of duty, and for that this seller earned the 5* rating in spite of the mistake. I would gladly do business with Witbecks again."
3,"Take this, Rugrats!","This collection of Bulgarian animation is amusing and appropriate for kids, whichis not what can be said about most of what's on television these days.But what does that have to do with Nickelodeon's beloved ""Rugrats""? The cartoons ""Baby Dreams at the Airport"" and ""Baby Dreams at the Automobile Factory"" are wilder and funnier than what Tommy's gang gets involved with and there's no annoying Angelica to frustrate the babies' attempts to explore their world.There's other good 'toons on this dvd - they have a group that's a cross between the 3 Stooges and the guys in ""Dumb and Dumber"" and that's funny. And ""The Intelligent Villiage"" reminds me of the old children's song ""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly..."" and all the humor that extends from that set-up.So try something a little different, expand your cultural horizons and watch this - you'll find that Bulgaria has a lot to offer the world of animation."
3,An OK product,"I was really excited to order this DVD and to have a piece of my Bulgarian childhood. The selection is just ok (there are more memorable Bulgarian cartoons out there.) I was disappointed that the Three Fools cartoon had an English voice-over: the original does not use words, just sounds like ""Hmmm"" and ""Ahhh"" and that is what has made it a favorite over the years!"
1,Poor representation of Bulgarian Animation,"Don't waste your time or money. Silly translation of sounds explained in English. I love ""Three fools"" but this was nothing that I wanted to see. It is amaizing how poor publishing and editing can trash talant. Sorry, I had my hopes too."
4,My Dream Adventure,"I recommend this video. It brought my ""dream city"" to life. Nathan Lane, as tour guide, brought just enough humor to the navigation in this awesome place. He showed some everyday life mirrored against the outstanding wealth of some of Venice's most fortunate inhabitants. We saw art treasures, tourist sights, and even learned some history. It is the kind of video that can be viewed more than once with something interesting in each viewing."
4,Haunting.,"Even with its strange plot, this book sucks you in. Malory isn't your typical teen--she has serious problems and danger is always just around the corner. When she falls for popular Ben, Malory's life is even more unpredictable. Will she risk everything just for him? You won't forget the ending."
1,"sorry, yes it is","Boring, kids jumping around on skis. Ski movie type music always blaring in the background. No pacing. i think the producers added the ""Not"" to the title by mistake."
5,Great book for new mothers,"This is my ""go to"" gift book for all new expectant mothers. The photos are beautiful and really fascinating. The written information is excellent and everyone I give this to always calls to tell me how much they love it. Not only does it tell you what to expect before the baby is here, but also what to do after. New fathers love it too, since they don't always know what the heck is going on but don't feel comfortable asking certain questions. All is revealed in this book.This is a must have for all new parents and I highly recommend it."
5,Very Good Read - Intrigue & Romance!,"Sonya knew her sister's marriage was in trouble - but she had no idea that the trouble would lead to her brother-in-law's murder and her sister's arrest! So, Sonya seeks the assistance of Dwayne, a well-know criminal defense attorney (it helps that he's extremely handsome). This ful size book kept me on my toes - intrigue and great emotional scenes between the characters. Also has a bit of my favorite topic - law - thrown in =)"
3,pretty good read,I thought this book was between pretty good and just okay. For me there were way too many twists to the plot. It kept going deeper and deeper. It was just pretty good for me. But I could be being biased. The previous book I read by her (to love a stranger) still has me reeling.
5,This One Can't Be Put Down,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. There was a perfect balance of mystery and romance. It kept me on the edge of my seat, so much to the point that I had to read it in two days. Between working, cooking, cleaning, etc. I picked this book up every chance I had."
2,Save your money...,"I read a variety of authors, everything from the classics to the new ghetto romance type novels. Therefore, I consider myself to be open minded when reading something new. Unfortunately, this novel was far from what I expected when I saw that the other reviewers had given it 5 stars. The plot dragged on for far too long. The two main love interests had so much fire that I couldn't wait for them to finally hook up but when they did the scene was bland. Why build up to nothing???? In addition the mystery aspect of it was beyond believable. I mean I know it's fiction but come on!!! Like I said, save your money. I skipped through the last few pages just to get the story over with because it was tired..... and I was tired of it!"
3,Not great but not bad!,I have enjoyed several books from Ms. Byrd but I just didn't like this one. Some of the law enforcement aspects of the case were not accurate. No one in their right mind gets shot at and stalked and refuses police help or refuses to hire their own security if they can afford too. Its like duh someone is trying to kill you and you dont want help. The female character was just mean and rude at times and not very likable to me. I didn't find myself routing for her like you should. At some point I couldn't read the book anymore and stopped and went back to reading it. If the female lead was not so mean from the start and Ms. Byrd did a better job of researching realistic police investigations I would have like it more. Maybe I'm hard on it because I'm a detective sergeant. Just my two cents.
4,Excellent reference for the casual UNIX shell programmer,"This little (152-page) book takes the mystery out of Bourne and Korn shell programming. It treats topics like logical operators, arithmetic, programming constructs (if, for, while, etc.) giving numerous, concise examples. Applications for standard commands are presented including a large vi reference section. I particularly like the explanation of the ""exec"" command - easy to understand yet thorough, like the entire book. I don't do enough UNIX scripts to warrant wading through a huge reference book and I suspect there are many others like myself. If you are a competent programmer in two or more languages, this book should be enough to get you on your way doing shell programming."
4,Ok for leather seats!,I puchased this to go under my carseat and I too brought my car to the state police to have it installed and they did not say not to use it for the car. Infact I have leather seats and it actually stops the carseat from sliding because of the grips on the bottom of it! Overall it has saved my seats and has not allowed the carseat to move! I would buy again in a heartbeat!!
2,Slides too much,"I like the pockets in the front, but the undermat slides too much. I bought a rubber mat instead, although it lacked the pockets."
3,Not too bad...,"This mat is not designed to protect your seats from indentations. I have used it for 3 years now, and it does not protect from spills either since it is not much wider or taller than my sons carseat. I do like the pockets in the front, as it's a good garbage holder or toy holder. I have leather seats, and I don't have a problem with it sliding around since my seat is properly tightened down. I will be getting a rubberized one this time around."
1,Not recommended,"My husband and I had one of these in our car and loved it! Beware though... When we went to a car seat inspection, we were told that these are not actually approved for use under a car seat!"
1,not recommended,"These sounded like a good idea at the time we purchased them. Unfortunately, the state police trooper who installed our seat instructed us not to use them. Anything placed under the car seat can compromise the safety of the seat. The car seat will slide. Please don't buy ANY undermats."
1,Ruined my leather seat!!!,Thought I was protecting my brand new leather car seat until today when we switched to the next type of car seat- hundreds of black spots from the mat in the leather that I cannot remove. Already spent more wasted money buying leather cleaners to try and remove with no luck. Not only a waste of money for product but now will cost me who knows how much to repair the leather. Stay away from this product!
3,Highway Patrol told me to jump off the bridge and I did,"Guys, anyone who is saying this item was not crash tested and all that, please think outside the box!! What WAS really crash tested?? Did you read your manual? Did you not notice that most car seats advise you to put a rolled towel under your infant/child seat to get to a perfect incline, which is very very important that the seat is at perfect incline. Do you think the seat was crash tested with the towel underneath it or did the towel come with the child seat package?USE YOUR SENSES GUYS!! PLEASE!! Please don't enjoy fake sense of satisfaction that you did the right thing by not using this product and asking everyone not to use it becuase you love your kid more than your leather seat. Well, in that case, why don't you keep the child inside the house all the time?Mat is not long enough, hence the 3 stars."
1,Don't Use,"My husband and I had one of these in our car and loved it! Beware though... When we went to a car seat inspection, we were told that these are not actually approved for use under a car seat!"
1,Also RUINED my leather!!!!!!,"I purchased this product with the best of intentions, It was wonderful. I didnot have the slipage issues as did others and the mesh pockets were pretty helpful as well. BUT, while cleaning out my car today I was so very angry to find that where my infant carrier and base were there is a big black stripe across the back seat AND where I have only had the full size carseat 2 months there are dozens of black dots on the seat that now make my tan leather look mildewed.Will not clean off!! BEWARE OF THIS SEAT ""PROTECTOR"". I will be calling the manufacturer to complain."
2,It's okay...,"This mat should be bigger. It hardly covers much of the seat beyond the car seat. Also, it is a bit flimsy and moves around with each person who sits in the back. A beach towel would work much better! Only good thing about it is the pockets. They are very handy."
5,Car Seat Undermat,"Great product. Allows space for snacks, wipes, toys, and pacifers. A great addition to this Grandma's car and car seat."
1,Don't Use - Damaged My Seat,"I purchased the mat for my leather seat, and used it for about 3 months. It appeared to be working fine, but when I went to remove the mat from my car, was I in for a rude awakening.... My leather seat was completely damaged (with hundreds and hundreds of indented black spots that resulted from the bottom side of the mat. I just received a quote stating that the repairs could cost me up to $2000. I definitely recommend against this, and would give it 0 stars if I could."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back. They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit. These are unecessary and really a pain."
1,A Definite No-No,"On the day my daughter and I were discharged from the hospital, my mom and dad took my car to have the car seat installed. They had been advised to go to the Police Station or the Fire Department to have this done. The officer who had been called to install the car seat advised them against using the carseat undermat. He stated it would cause the car seat to slide which of course would be unsafe. I was hoping to protect my seat with the carseat undermat, but my daughter's safety is my priority."
3,"Works, but...","After my wife and I's recent purchase of a Subaru Outback with leather, we felt it necessary to protect the leather. After purchasing one of these undermats, we experienced no slippage or shifting. I'm not sure where all these state troopers are coming from to install your car seats, but here in California, they don't exactly have the time to do so. My major gripe with this purchase, however, is that if you are on a budget, as children will often force you to be, just wrap the base of the car seat with a blanket or any similar covering that won't impair the car seat safety and save yourself the 15.00."
2,slips but gets the job done,"got this two years ago and it remains in my car always. Only problem is that in comparison with the one I got as a gift for my baby shower, this one slides all over the seat and does not remain in position. Can't find the name of the first one I have but that one has some type of material underneath so it remains in position without requiring any adhesive or tape or attachment to the car chair"
5,my niece loved it for her baby,"My neice says she uses this every day and the ""baby"" that I bought it for is now almost two! A great baby gift."
1,Useless,"I had my car seat inspected as well. Although they advise against any ""aftermarket"" products for car seats, I'm not opposed to them entirely. I will continue to use my bunting inside. But there is no way that the fleecey (top) side of this mat could secure a car seat at all. I'm sorry I bought it. The inspector gave me a small rubber mat made out of shelf lining material from a dollar store."
2,Not needed and not approved in crashes,"I got the undermat as a gift and I thought it was a great idea as I have leather seats in my car and I thought the car seat base was going to damage it.I went to a place to set up my car seat correctly and they told me the undermat have not been tested on car crashes so I should not use it, so I removed it. I was still concerned about the leather but I have have the car sear placed for over 5 months and the seat is in perfect condition, so no undermat is needed."
3,Could buy it but save your money and use a towel,"The idea behind this product is great. You can store snack and other knicknacks.However, the most cost effective product to protect your seat is a thick cotton towel. I have been using that for five months and not one issue of damage or discoloration.Save your money and put it towards your child's college fund."
4,interesting,"Not you everyday ""radio music"". If you like folk music and have any vegetarian leanings you should love this CD."
3,Box was opened,"When I received this product it seemed like it had been used and opened before, but this product is working properly and no other complaints."
5,Whoa Mally!,"OMG!! Mally you are a GENIOUS!!!I first heard of Mally on Celebrity Baby blog (her twins are gorgeous!) & I looked up her beautyline & I FINALLY got a chance to order the lipstick 2 days ago & being impatient, I got 2 day shipping so I can try it fast. NO WASTED MONEY!!I got Manilla Mauve & at first I thought it was way too light but when I tried it on, I melted! It's a wonderful dark pinkish color that LASTS!!! I have dry skin & lips & this was so creamy & rich & felt perfect! It wasnt waxy & didnt dry out my lips. The proof was in a kiss. Boy, it leaves an impression! I'm making this my #1 shade! DONT EVER STOP SELLING IT!!!!"
2,Not all I expected,I received my mally lipstick in time and I couldn't wait. I tried it and I feel it is a bit drying to my lips. I just don't like it. Sorry Mally.
1,defect,"I think I might have got a defect product. In addition of the poor picture and sound quality as mentioned by the earlier reviewer, my DVD also shows ""blocks"" during some scenes and sometimes the sound got distorted and even paused. Very annoying. Though Caballe is out of her prime anyway. By the way, this series's sound all seem to be bad. I also have the Jose Cura version, which I think the sound is even worse."
2,Fact of Fiction?,"After completing this book, I was left with some unsettled thoughts and questions about Mr. Abraham's life. This led me to a quick internet search about the author. The first hit from the search page was a documented list of items throughout the book which could not be corroborated. Included in this list, unfortunately, is the lack of any official record of Abraham as a POW in any military documents nor is there any record of his MIA status from his unit's daily reports."
3,El Toque Del Amor,"This CD by Ted is upbeat, inspiring and motivating. We get our first glimpse of the roboust performance abilities this artist eloquently delivers. His multi-talented capability is evident by the diverse selection of songs and rhythms exquisitely blended for our lasting enjoyment."
4,1/100 MG RX-78-2,"Overalll ,I thought this kit is good for its value, although first time builders may find the head somewhat difficult to put together, and it will require minor painting to bring out the full potential of the kit."
1,wasn't what I thought it was,"I thought this was an action figure-not a model to put together.It was to advanced for an 8 year old,even his dad had a hard time."
5,The Art of Being and Becoming,"Congratulations on finding this book, if you randomly got here. I purchase this book often, because I give it away often. I find it to be the best book to give to a friend if they have inquired about the teachings of Hazrat Inayat Khan but have not yet read anything else from the collection of books that contain his teachings. It is very approachable, articulate and we in the ""west"" can relate to it easily. Best wishes."
5,Well Worth Buying!,Well worth buying. I watched this several times because there are sooooo many nuggets and pointers to the truth. You won't be wasting your $$!!!
5,"HERE IS $100,000, NO GIMMICK ...","If you read this book you are guranteed to save more than $100,000 over the next 2-3 decades. This book not only shows you how to save money but also how to live below your means thus saving thousands each year.His topics from insurance, car buying and housing are a must read.If you are looking to invest there is also a topic for you.He also informs you that you cannot have EVERYTHING especially at the SAME TIME!"
3,A very basic introduction to osteopathic medical education,"This book contains very basic information and I would only recommend it to those who want to understand the essential structure of osteopathic medical education. It contains a lot of commonsense information that can be found online for free. I only rated it three stars because I didn't find it as helpful as I had hoped. It didn't provide any information that I didn't already know. I don't recommend it to someone who already has a basic knowledge of osteopathy and wants to gain more in-depth knowledge. For those individuals I strongly recommend The DOs: Osteopathic Medicine in America, by Norman Gevitz."
5,if you buy one compilation this year,"You might not expect a topflight singer-songwriter collection to come from an iconoclastic, scrappy punk label like Kill Rock Stars. But that's just what they've done -- not only by assembling unreleased tracks from such notables as Laura Veirs, Sufjan Stevens, The Moore Brothers, Great Lakes Swimmers, and Lovers (among many others) -- but by assembling them into a program that combines listenable flow with a series of delightful surprises. These aren't diamonds in the rough, they're fully realized diamonds."
1,Not Mothman ... Mythman,"A book by a nutter who uncritically believes in such tripe as Elves, Sprites, Bigfoot, Mothman and probably Godzilla and Mothra as well.This book should be re-categorized as Fantasy Fiction a la Lord of the Rings.Jeesh!"
4,A crisp example of Dee Dee on the way up.,"i've been searching for this since C.D. was invented, This album never left my musical memory. A wonderful example of late ""70' fusion and vocals. this is a great transcription. I remember hearing ""Sorry seems to be the hardist word"" on the old NYC jazz station WRVR, and nearly driving off the road. The musiacianship is stellar, Harvey mason, [Fourplay], Stanley Clarke producer and bass, Geoge Duke, and a host of cutting edge musicians of that era, Dee Dee won the 1997 grammy for best jazz vocals, I knew she would eventually rise to that level, and ""Just Family"" is one of the reasons why."
1,didn't work,I hate Vi$ta. This cable should have made it possible to run my mill off a new machine (that I did not want). It didn't work. Another one did but I realllllllly HATE Vi$ta.
5,Excellent After Pregnancy!!,"After pregnancy I try every stool softener on the market and none of them work. I was for the whole first week after pregnancy in pain with an episiotomy and no able to poop..and Phillip's Laxative did the work just in one night. It is just Magnesium, that is the secret when you are constipated. Get this pills (2 at night when you are constipated or get magnesium pills and you will be back to normal."
4,Additional LSAT info,"I liked my Silent Timer - unitl it broke - it did help with pacing.It was mentioned that LSAT does not allow it, someone spoke of using a digital watch.According to the information I got with my registration, digital watches are not allowed either. Only analog. whoopee. Way to make a hard test unreasonably harder.I haven't used an analog watch since I was 5."
4,remodeling,This is a nice piece if you aren't expecting too much. It looks fantastic in our guest bathroom!! We had a problem with it item being damaged upon delivery. The granite on the top corner was chipped in shipment and I have to say that their customer service is absolutely fantastic. We ended up keeping this item and have no complaints at all. it's not made of solid wood but for the price I didn't expect that either. Definately was a great buy!
2,Vermes advocate a Jewish interest,I am a German scholar of Ancient History and my English is not the best.The Jesus of Vermes is not the Jesus of the gospels.All the gospels date from the second century (post 135).Fot that reason the chassid Jesus of Vermes is of no interest to me.
2,Jesus the Roman,"An interesting and even daring book, but still in the stereotypical mode that ignores the presence of the real King of the Jews and the Messiah at the time - Herod. It's so obvious. Why is the utterly false history of him as the one who massacred the Innocents at Bethlehem - proven to be utterly fictional, and admitted so by every fair historian - still routinely perpetuated by christians and jews? It's not even that he was an Edomite arab as Robert Graves and others have said.He was the Roman tetrarch Caesar Philip, of Paneas fame, admitted to even in the New Testament and Josephus. Archaeological evidence is coming out from many mainstream sources, like Bowersock, Finkelstein, Millar, to name a few, as well as evidence in coins and ancient, non-biblical texts. (see my book 'The Libyad')"
1,No explanatory notes,"Note well: No footnotes or other explanatory material is included, making this edition almost useless for most readers."
1,"Not ""NEW"" book.","This item was labeled new but did not appear so. It had pencil writing in the front inside cover which was erased but was still visible and created an indent of writing. The book also had evidence that it had been wet by some liquid which showed on all the top third of all the pages. I needed this book for an English class so did not have time to return it but it was definitely not in ""NEW"" condition. Overall very dissatisfied with the product."
1,Text of play with none of Folger Library 's annotations,Waste of $0.99. None of the Folger Library's excellent annotations are included.DO NOT BUY THIS COPYThis content can be obtained for free in a variety of places.
2,Warriors Review,"Mr Hastings was not quite up to the mark of his WWII histories, perhaps because his heart simply wasn't in it. I got the feeling that he was writing at the urging of his publisher to get something in print , although many of his protagonists were indeed interesting, but largely sidebars to the great historical sweeps which he can so aptly cover. I find his conclusion that heroes are largely people whom you might not like somewhat of a stretch, although he indeed did butress his postion with examples, if not even-handedness."
2,Disappointing,"While the subjects chosen as warriors are intriguing, the stories are somewhat superficial and not tersely edited, but somewhat rambling. I had expected a lot more.....disappointing."
2,Decent basic dechlorinator,"Good for what it does, basically a dechlorinator. There are tons of these on the market, some with additional benefits...For the price, I just can't justify buying this anymore. Again, there are many other conditioners (some by seachem) that dechlorinate and much more. Depending on your setup, I might recommend Neutral Regulator for hard water, or even a basic Aquasafe conditioner."
3,Temporary fix,The product works well a a temporary fix-the only way to fix the problem is to do daily water changes until issue is cleared.
5,Smells odd but works so well!,"I'd call myself an aquarium aficionado and I swear by this product. The best part is that you only need like half a cap full for each water change. YES, it smells strange/bad, but it is so good at what it does, so I can't help but come crawling back to to Prime whenever I try something else. I wish Seachem always packaged these with the squeeze top, because the pour top always gets a little out of hand for me. Note: twist the top TIGHT, it always manages to leak for me!"
5,Unforgettable,"I read this novel 10 years ago and I never been able to forget its haunting but beautiful story. Luke and Sarah's lives were realistic,and the author easily got me transported and lost in their world.The plot was uniquely different,unlike any other I have read.I would love to get a copy for my own personal collection,so that I can relive this absolutely wonderful journey of Luke and Sarah.This is with no doubt the best historical romance I have ever read."
3,NO means NO!!!!,"People, ignore the 5 star reviews!! You want a tortured hero who feels he's a loser? You want a man who needs love?You want a REALLY, satisfying read? Try ""Morning Glory"" by Lavyrle Spenser.This book depicts two lonely souls. Okay. Liked them at first. Interesting at times. Here's where it goes wrong. Loves her so much he wants to RAPE her into being his wife. No doubt a true concept in those times, but the fact that the author sets him up with a former conviction of rape, makes me hate him when he gets drunk and forces himself on heroin. She's so understanding all the time it makes me ill. Yes he works hard in the fields, but when it comes to the relationship it's always the heroin who does all the work.Do not waste your money or your time!!"
2,Rainbow Season,I had read this a long time ago and could not find it again. Wish I had not spent the money for this out of print book. It really is not well written. Not sure why I liked it so well years ago.
1,Flawed Account of Flawed Points.,"That's basically what this book is. It's an in-depth array of flawed arguments that comprise the more major flawed anti-abortion arguments. The principles are all the same.To be honest, this book (which can be read online at ohiolife.org) presents logic that is circular and rather childish. Schwarz claims to set aside the argument that a fetus is not a person, yet makes many supporting arguments that are clearly based on his premise that the fetus IS a person worthy of the same rights as you and I. In many cases, he utterly avoids the crux of the whole abortion issue: is a fetus worth the same as a person? This is why I call is arguments circular and childish. Highly unenlightened.I would not recommend this book for two reasons: 1. the arguments are essentially the same as those you can find from any anti-abortion website, and 2. the book itself is available online. Absolute waste of money."
1,Horrible waste of money,"This is not a ""book"" folks, it's a pamphlet. And it's filled with amazing advice such as: ""The real reason most women never meet any men is that they are too busy just trying to pick them up."" And: ""To keep him wanting to be with you, you must make him feel special every minute you are with him.""PUL-LEEZE. This book is written by a guy who's obviously been burned by shallow women, and he has generalized HIS problem into OUR problem. The way to meet ""wonderful"" men, according to the author, ladies, is to make yourselves into adoring doormats! Don't buy."
4,Really not the Darren Hayes I'm used to hearing....different,"I really was surprised when I purchased this album..Aside from his dreamy ballads and pop styling, the album wasn't too bad. I however don't pretty much care for his ""boy-band"" styling.Other wise aside from his ballads, pop songs and of course the bonus song ""The Heart Wants What it Wants"" (really a great song to end the cd with)The album in summary wasn't bad, still something worth listening to."
2,OK minus the lyrics,"If you are the kind of person who likes to listen to music about having sex, wanting sex or thinking about sex, well, this is the album for you. There are a few good songs on here towards the end, but for the most part, eew. My least favorite is ""Creepin' Up On You"", about the narrator stalking a girl, ""drinking the glass she left on the bar"" and ""following her around in her car"". Fact or fiction, the song ""creeps"" me out, plain English. However, if you can look past the lyrics and just listen to Hayes' beautiful voice, you will enjoy the album thoroughly."
5,It's even better than Spin,When Darren is singing live you can hear every emotion in his soul coming out through the songs...it is a must buy for anyone who has a CD player!
4,Nice first step,"I enjoyed the cd, it is a tad bit different from what he did with Savage Garden. But still enjoyable listen for the most part. There were only 4 songs that i wasn't really feeling throughout the CD. But everything was solid. He has always been a great songwriter and you see that on different songs like Strange Relationship, Insatiable, I Miss You and Dirty. Which is kind of weird, he's like a stalker after someone that he really likes and breaks it down in detail. Its totally different. Also enjoyed Crush (1980 Me) , Good Enough and Like It Or Not.I know this was his first solo effort and even i'm an Savage Garden fan. This is a step in the right direction for Darren Hayes and i'm sure a sign of better things to come for him. Purchasing i would check out some songs to it first and see whether this one appeals to you or not. If not you should check his 2nd one ""Tension & The Spark"" a standout cd that hits on the all right notes..nuff said."
5,Another Hit,"This is one of the most heartfelt CD's I have ever bought it is a must buy for anyone who has ever been in love, insecure, or heartbroken."
3,mediocre songs but i don't regret getting it,"First of all, I'm a big savage garden fan. However, I must be honest...the songs on this cd are not very good. Savage Garden's past albums had songs which were good, such as ""Madly Truly Deeply"" and ""I Knew I Loved You."" Here, there's no song that really stands out as good. The only one song that's ok on the whole cd is ""I Miss You."" Now, I think Darren Hayes' voice is one of the best I've ever heard. It's just unfortunate that the songs on this cd doesn't show off his fantastic singing talent. With all that said, I still do not regret buying this cd just to show my support for his solo career and in hopes that he'll make a 2nd album that will hopefully utilize the great talent in his voice."
4,Take a spin with Darren Hayes,"I really like Savage Garden and was eager to hear this new cd by Darren Hayes. I bought a copy and, while its not as good as the cds with his former bandmate, it shows promise. The lead single, ""Insatiable"" is my favorite song with Hayes doing a haunting sound alike of Michael Jackson (and a better song than the any of the Gloved One's songs on his supposed ""Invicible"" cd). Other good songs on this cd are ""Creeping up on You"", ""Crush (1980 Me) and ""Strange Relationship"". It will be interesting to see what musical direction Darren Hayes takes after this cd. I hope he takes a little longer and puts more of his soul into the next one. As it goes, however, this is a decent cd, especially if you are a Darren Hayes fan."
5,Not Alone Inside My Head,"I have just got to say how grateful I am for this album - many of the lyrics echo the feelings of anyone who has ever found themselves pulled into the vortex of unrequited love - the songs are a friend to those caught up in that kind of relationship, they make one feel understood, and somehow less alone - they articulate feelings that otherwise would seem to defy description. Amazingly sensitive songs, astonishingly so. The guy who wrote these has a real gift. Rare indeed, rare indeed. Thank you..."
5,I just love it,"I wasn't even sure I was going to like Darren's solo music; I bought this for ONE SONG and ended up loving everything on it. It's so difficult to get this talented performer's music---I would urge you to buy, even if you're currently unsure about his solo work. Once I forgot who he 'used' to be and concentrated on who he became, I thoroughly enjoyed this cd (and still do, regularly!)"
4,Good solo debut,"I have to say that the singles didn't convince me, so it took me some time to buy this album - but it's a good buy. If you are a Savage Garden fan, you won't be disappointed. And while the singles as such didn't do so well, the album as a complete is really great - very 80s, very smooth - the kind of thing you expect from Darren."
3,A Familiar 'Spin' On Previous Work,"Darren Hayes' first solo effort apart from former group Savage Garden finds him mining much the same territory as that duo, with the results ranging from stellar to average. First single 'Insatiable' is trademark SG, though at times sounds like an attempt to cater to the NSync/BSB crowd, particularly the Justin-like falsetto late on in the track--the other ballads on the album are actually much better, namely 'I Miss You'and 'Good Enough'. The touches of electronica find throughout the uptempo numbers of the set actually reduce many of those songs to dated,'80s synth-pop throwaways--neither 'Creepin Up On You'or'Dirty' have the edge that their titles would suggest, though 'Crush' rises above both of those tracks as the set's best uptempo number. Overall, SPIN is a decent solo start, though it falls short of the overall consistency of SG's last set AFFIRMATION."
5,Cool Songs,I regret myself why I didn't chase the post-Savage-Garden. This album includes the eazy cozy songs by the most powerful composers all over the world such as Walter Afanasieff (Mariah Carey) and Rick Nowels (Belinda Carlisle) that I've ever been thinking.Good Enough is good enough to be the best song of this album against its modest tune (and please tell me What You Like about the best song).
3,Very confusing,"Spin was okay, nothing stupendous and lacking something special. The lyrics are pretty decent, but the music could use a lot of work. The cd was something that I was expecting, but very different at the same time. If you are a Darren Hayes fan, then the cd is pretty good. But if you are expecting something with more feeling like some of Savage Garden's songs, you should really evaluate your decision of buying this."
2,Super disappointing,"Like many of you, I'm a big Savage Garden fan. But please don't force yourselves to like Darren because of that.The title track ""Insatiable"" is good, but the rest of them [stink]. My advice:just buy the single! Darren can't have the chemistry just by himself without Daniel. After all,I mean the whole is more than its sum in Savage Garden."
2,Unfortunate,"I was hoping that Darren Hayes debut solo album would have some artistic merit, but unfortunately I was wrong. The entire album was charted out like any other bubble gum artist. Don't get me wrong Savage Garden were pop but they also wrote and played the instruments (or the better half did anyway), and its obvious to anyone that listens that Daniel Jones was the talent and Darren was merely a interpretive singer. That being said there are a couple enjoyable songs ""Good Enough"" being the only one that strives for a definitive sound that isn't already to cliched.Darren shame on you for selling out and doing anything the execs wanted in order to sell albums, where is your pride in this contrived mess of bubblegum? I'm hoping maybe it will grow on me....."
4,Well...I dunno,"Honestly, at the first time when I was listening this whole album, I was little dissapointed. Because, he shows us the different music style when he was the member of Savage Garden. But, I think if his music style were same as Savage Garden, then I would not prefer this album like now. I am still confusing whether I like his new music or not. However, this is just his first solo debut album, thus I do hope that his next album will show the people sort of improvement. I never expect that he can show everything at once, even the first time. To tell you the truth, There is no perfect album which could satisfy all people including music fans, on the earth, for my part. Mere the somewhat development and change of the music, step by step."
4,The Third Savage Garden Album,"The title of this review says it all really. There is not a great deal of departure in style from what has gone before, but that's not a bad thing. There is just enough diversity and growth to keep it interesting, but honestly, he could have released this under the name Savage Garden and it would have sold shed loads.Catchy songs, typical and expected lyrics...sing-along stuff for sure. Some nice ballads, some dancy numbers, some serious singer stuff..presto. Savage Garden!Give Spin a spin."
4,Pretty Good...,"But if you're expecting more Savage garden with the exception of one man, read this. Although Darren didn't do a bad job with help from the amazing talent of Walter A., the structure departs from the classic Savage Garden sound. The music is still here and better than ever, but it's free-style manner makes for a free-style melody. Like Pop's answer to Free-form Jazz, it's probly more safe to say you probly won't find sheet music to this album."
2,Um...ok,"darren is almost nothing without Dan. the music just doesnt sound right, it lacks something badly. you just can't name it. i listened to this cd like a million times and felt it needed something alot more. if you've listened to Savage garden stuff you'll find out that this isnt that great :("
2,...Um...ick!,"Ok, I did listen to this CD on Amazon before buying, read the reviews and already own both Savage Garden CD's: How bad could this be?""Ick"", is the only word that comes to mind to describe this album. Granted Darren Hayes still sings like he did in Savage Garden, but ends up coming across more like an early Michael Jackson or Prince. Rather than the distinct, catchy, ""Euro Pop"" sound that was going on before. If I'd wanted ""Michael Jackson"", I would have bought Michael Jackson!The tecno sound to the ablum is good, and earns two stars, but the lyrics and singing surely bring it down!In the end I have to say I gave this album every chance, but was uninspired by the mediocre performance."
1,sad sad day for savage,"If I were Daniel I would be sorely embarrassed. The first time I listened to this CD I hated it. The second time I strongly disliked it - only ""Insatiable"" started to grow on me, but even that is not a quality song. There is essentially no music on this CD - just computer generated crap accompanying adequate lyrics but awful melodies and beats. Darren is nothing without Daniel, and this solo attempt proves it."
2,This book reads like a drawn out soap-opera.,"I had the opportunity to read this book while I was studyingin Russia. Instead of it being awe inspiring, I found Ms.Erickson's comments on how Catherine the Great, like how shesuffered during her wedding cermony because of her constrictivedress, to be boring and unecessary. Ms. Erickson addedextranneous information that kept making me say, ""get onwith the plot."" She then teased with sumptous banter aboutCatherine's sex life only to end up using vague referencesinstead of meaty tidbits. I would have like to have gottenmy hands on a copy before it went to press so I could haveasked, ""do you really think this part is necessary?"""
1,Boring and Tedious,"This is my first and last Carolly Erickson book. She should take a lesson from Alison Weir on how to create a vivid 3-dimensional description of a historical person. After I put this book down i thought ""Catherine the Great was so dull"" but then I realized that, no, it was just this book!"
4,"Good, but not perfect","I became interseted in Russian history in class and especially in Catherine because she is such an amazing figure. I thought the book was written splendidly, and I admired the work, however, it's focus was purely on her life before becoming empress, which is good, but there is very little about her life after becoming empress. This book seemed to be clearly written by a woman and I don't think that it talked enough about her faults. I do like how it is a very interesting to read, shares lots of small stories, and it doesn't dwell on her sex life like many other books do. Overall I think it is an excellent book, telling an excellent story excellently."
4,great catherine,History buffs will love this book. The author goes into such detail that I could imagine everything about the characters. It was like reading a scandalous story about a scandalous woman but it happened to be a true story about one of the greatest leaders of our time.
1,Catherine the Boring,"Erickson approaches Catherine the Great as if Russian history were no more complex, scandalous, or mysterious than a Jane Austen novel. She seems to have decided that the empress is a modern woman with whom she would like to be friends, and in order to defend this view, she dismisses any unfriendly characteristic the ruler may have had. According to this book, Catherine the Great was humble, amiable, enlightened, and a welcome addition to any women's tea party whether as a precocious yet modest teenager of a grandmotherly autocrat. Catherine's legendary sexual appetite? An invention of anti-monarchist propaganda. Catherine's possible murder of her husband? Dismissed for lack of evidence. Catherine's oppression of the serfs? Forced on her by her cabinet. New interpretations of historical characters should be defended by arguments and documentation, not by one-sentence dismissals of opposing views."
4,Live album captures the energy of the band,"I'm not a big fan of live albums, but I am aware of Front 242's ability to do powerful live shows so I gave this CD a chance.As live CD's go, the sound quality is excellent. It features all their most known songs, 'Headhunter' is excellent as usual! Many songs are given dramatic makeovers.What is most evident is the more dance-orientated feel of their live shows than of their stuido albums. They know how to work a crowd and throughout this show Jean Luc De Meyer and, in particular Richard JK, are constantly encouraging the crowd and talking to them. It's nice to see such a strong band-crowd interaction.Even if you don't usually like live albums, I'd give this one a go. But don't be expecting a sing-along type show. With their emphasis on dance in their live shows, this one is for the danceloor rather than for the mind!"
3,"not awful, not awesome: renovation is not always for better","When I bought this live cd I was really scared: I had read that my favourite band had now turned into Trance-Techno-Acid music.When I listened to it, I still recognised the wonderful 242 sound among the renewed techno sounds. The songs are wonderful, so they should have to make it real bad not to deserve a listening. Some versions are very good, such as 'Moldavia' or 'Headhunter', even though there're others, such as 'No Shuffle' and 'Body to Body' which are really sacrilegeous.I hope their new album, expected for 2002, will be better than this. I know -and I like- that bands are always in constant evolution, but that doesn't necessarily imply that this evolution is good. i don't like techno, so I'd prefer some other evolution. But Front 242 will always rule (together with Skinny Puppy)"
3,"Sorry, but this isn't the F242 I used to know","Unfortunately, this album lacks most attributes of the true body-synth atmosphere that used to be synonymous with Front 242. Here, they have turned into some kind of techno, which they do not really master. They have tried to create a new image which is inconsistent with the basic culture of EBM and the band itself. The result is a collection of confusing remixes without any real spirit. The aggressive and manipulative feeling is gone. The bass rhythm is far to low and the vocals are not convincingly synchronized with the music. I only find ""No Shuffle"" somewhat interesting.OK. It is not a bad album. It works quite well as mediocre techno-something. But it is not the real spirit of F242. Get the old masterpieces ""Front by Front"" and ""Tyranny for You"" instead. That's the true EBM."
3,Nice little something.,I don't know if I didn't read the description all that well or if it was not on there. Sign was a little flimsy.
4,Works very well.,"Out of the box and mated to the Logitech i-touch keyboard, this mouse set up in 3 minutes. The taskbar icon makes adjusting sensitivity, etc. very easy. The mouse then works as well as any corded, mechanical mouse. However, I found it a little too big for my hand and, having been an optical mouse user for some time, a bit less precise than I like. I've ordered the optical unit and will report on that when I've gotten it installed."
2,Excessive batteries discharger...,"I've bought this product and despite of its amazing resources that make ordinary tasks so much easiers, the batteries discharge is simply unbearable! I don't know if it's a problem of this specific device, but the post selling service of Logitech or its online support should be considered before shopping such products. I am feeling frustrated, because I couldn't yet contact the manufacturer to try to answer my questions and I cannot also think about changing the product: I bought it in the USA and I live in Brazil, so... If someone has anything that may help me, please email me at gilsoncoura@uol.com.br and I'll be really greateful."
2,cheaply made and poor quality,"I was very disapointed with my pendant. It looks better in the picture than real life. It might be a good gift for a little girl, but it's cheaply made and looks like it was stamped out in a press. I guess I was expecting better quality, but you get what you pay for. I gave mine away as a gift."
5,Great for the price,"I was very pleased when I recieved this...I love that it doesn't look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture, it's not enormously huge. Just the right size and very pretty."
3,It's OK,"I have to say it's not as nice as it looks in the picture, and maybe I'm just not that bright, but I kind of expected it to come with a chain, which it didn't. For the money, and considering the quality, including the chain would have been nice."
5,Beautiful!!,"I ordered this for my friend who is Wiccan, and when i recieved it, i didnt want to give it away. It is so beautiful and shiny, and i got it quickly. I don't think the picture gives this as much credit as it deserves. It is very beautiful.. a little pointy at the corner parts, but magnificent. She wears it every day!! :)"
3,earl gray tea,I love earl gray tea this tea is average I love earl gray tea this tea is average I love earl gray tea this tea is average
3,Early Grant album shows promise but doesn't quite get there,"Most of the songs on this album are forgettable, but it's worth getting for ""Father's Eyes"" and ""Faith Walkin' People,"" which are closer to Grant's usual standard. ""O Sacred Head"" is an interesting track--Grant and her two sisters singing Bach in a cappella harmony, punctuated at appropriate (and unplanned) moments by rolls of thunder. These are pretty much the only songs on the album that stand up to repeated listenings, but Grant's fresh, clear young voice helps the others considerably. Not bad for a teenager surreptitiously making an album as a surprise for her parents while studying full-time at college."
4,"I think the Father liked ""My Father's Eyes""","Amy Grant's second release, MY FATHER'S EYES, became one of her best known albums. It spawned Amy her first #1 hit (""Father's Eyes""), and sold over 95,000 copies. Which was pretty good for a Christian artist in 1979. I personally like the words in ""Father's Eyes"" (And when I'm called to stand and tell just what you saw in me/More than anything I know/I want your words to be/She's got her Father's Eyes). It gives Amy Grant a sense of innocence. My favorites on this CD are ""You Were There"", ""Giggle"", and ""Never Give You Up"". Throughout the early '80s, MY FATHER'S EYES was labeled as one of the most popular albums in Christian history. Then in 1982, AGE TO AGE took the spotlight from this album. But overall, it's a pretty good album."
1,Elevator Comedy,"Novocaine for the funny bone. I ordered this CD along with one by Andy Andrist, because Stanhope recommended them both. Well, apparently ol' Dougie had one too many Jägermeisters that day, because, while Andrist is a flat-out hoot, this Barry guy doesn't even approach funny. His delivery is whiny and flat, and his material is occasionally amusing but that's about it. He'll have his own show on the Tee Vee someday, no doubt about it, along with the rest of the safe, marginally talented hacks who currently infest American airwaves.If you like Bill Hicks, Lenny Bruce, or Stanhope, avoid this guy like a bad sitcom."
5,This is the very best book I have ever read.,"In this book, you can see HOW and WHY the two main characters fall in love. It is not just the most beautiful woman in the entire universe falling for the sexiest man who ever had a deep dark secret. This is a book about real people who open up to each other and finally get the happy ending they deserve. All of the details of the book are perfect; everything about it is perfect. And to the reviewer below, they did make a movie out of it but the actor who played Will Parker was Christopher Reeve, who, bless his heart, just does not look like a scrawny underfed ex-con. If you loved the book do not watch the movie."
5,On the recommendation from a friend I decided to purchase,"Ms. Spencer's book ""Morning Glory"", she said she read it and loved it. She told me the plot,and I searched to find it. I'm a sucker for hero's who have lost all hope, and never have found a place in this world. Though set at the beginning of WWII it was for me a history buff a wonderful story of two very hurt souls who found in each other and the 'magic of love'.Ms. Spencer built up each character, gave this reader a backstory for each that made me love and want these two to find love together. As always her characters aren't perfect and that gave them depth. When the story came to an end, the ex-con and the widow with two kids, one on the way...had found that elusive thing(happiness) loved 'Morning Glory' teared up a time or two, the small town feel of the novel resonated like 'Peyton Place' in some ways...and you know that's what I love when books take you to a place you've never been and the author makes you feel that you have....JV"
2,Not my cup of tea,"After reading all the promising reviews of this book, I ran out to the library to get it. The first 1/3 of the book was interesting and cute, and I thought I'd found a winner. However, reading the details of Elly giving birth, and the author's strange focus on tongues really turned me off. Also, as a younger woman, the focus on children wasn't something I was very interested in. I can definitely see how others would find this book worthwhile, but it really wasn't for me."
4,I cried several times...,"Ok this one was a change from the normal love stories. I enjoyed it, and took my time reading it. I had a hard time trying to decide if this was four star or five. I rate it four and a half because I felt the range of emotions in this and rooted for their love, and I thoroughly enjoyed the secondary characters. I would recommend!"
5,A heart-warming story,"This story doesn't follow the template of a typical romance, where the book ends when the couple admits their mutual love and gets married. Elly and Will reach that point about halfway through the book. But as in real life, they haven't stopped growing when they tie the knot and so they both keep learning -by themselves and together- through the war and a criminal investigation. In the end the reader is thoroughly convinced they belong together and no force in the world can break their love and trust in each other.This story is a shining example of LaVyrle Spencer's talent to describe simple and warm people, quaint settings and uncomplicated plotlines in a slow pace and with tender images. If you want to be taken to a picturesque time and place, get to know and love `real' people and strengthen your belief in the healing power of love and friendship in the process, this book is an excellent choice."
4,4 stars...very enjoyable...,"Description from back of book:In town, they called her ""Crazy Widow Dinsmore."" But Elly was no stranger to their ridicule-she had been an outsider all her life, growing up in a boarded-up old house under the strict eye of her eccentric grandparents. now she was all alone, with two little boys to raise, and a third child on the way.He drifted into Whitney, Georgia, one lazy afternoon in the summer of 1941, hoping to put his lonely past behind him. He yearned for tenderness he had never known, the home he'd never had. All he needed was for someone to give him a chance.Then he saw her classified ad: WANTED-A husband. When he stepped across Elly Dinsmore's clutter yard, Will Parker knew he had come home at last...* This was my first LaVyrle Spencer book & I highly enjoyed it. The storyline. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt it was lacking mystery, humor & emotion at a lot of parts when it should've been there. Overall though I would recommend this book."
1,"No, no, no!","I got this book, along with Years, after both of them were highly recommended by a friend. Years was absolutey riveting--I sat up until 2am on a work night to finish it. I was thrilled that I had another great book to read.......then I actually read it. ECHH!!! Cardboard characters, dialogue that put me in mind of listening to toddlers try to converse, a story that was so predictable that I already had the plot figured out by the 10th page, and so on. I kept on plugging through in the hopes that it would get better--I loved some of the secondary characters, but the dreadful main story just kept dragging on and on and on and on. I don't know if I can ever force myself to read another novel by this author--I'll probably give her another try and decide after that. PLEASE do not read this terrible, boring book--instead read something else and be glad you spared yourself the suffering."
4,Human,"This is my first LaVyrle Spencer's novel and i love it. Will and Elly are so human, unlike the usual novel characters where the man and woman are model-like. This is a very good romance novel because you see how the love develops between the main characters and not ""lust-at-first-sight."" I cried when I read the letters they wrote to each other especially the one where Elly wrote something like she feels ""hoel"" with Will. The letter comes from the heart and it is very touching."
5,BRINGS A GLOW TO YOUR SOUL,ABSOLUTELY A WONDERFUL BOOK. ONE OF HER BEST. HEART WARMING AND INSPIRING FOR TRUE LOVE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
3,Nice first blocks,"Nice set of first blocks, didnt realize when I ordered that they were attached to each other. Granddaughter likes the colors and different noises. Nice safe toy for the price."
5,NECESSARY ROUGHNESS:SEASON ONE,I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THIS SHOW AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE THE FIRST SEASON TO RE-VISIT WHENEVER I WANT.
5,Love the show,"As someone who has a Master's level certification in sports counseling and have considered a Sports Psych doctorate, I thoroughly enjoy this show! Ordered new, it came in perfect condition."
5,Great Show!!,Worked without glitches. Show kept me entertained throughout the whole season. Had no problems starting or stopping a show. Was very user friendly.
3,Good show,Enjoyed the season. I like to watch strong women. Great stories and acting. Not sure if I would buy again...
4,"Uneven Storylines, Perhaps? Appealing, Maybe? Perfect Summer Fun, Absolutely!","Not sure if this show would work as well October - May. However, I start thinking about football in July. The upcoming selection video my FFL does every year, running hundreds of mock drafts, the trip to LV for the actual draft and loading up my offshore account for the first weekend of NFL.The point to my rambling tangent is that this show is first and foremost about the relationship that Dani has with a football player (""T.K"" King) and a football team. Someone once said ""life is all about timing"".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush. What this show is-is light hearted summer fare, which happens to be broadcast during the network ""dead zone""."
5,Best show on TV right now!,"The series is about a psychiatrist that is in the middle of a messy divorce, and while her practice is doing okay... It's a little slow. One night she goes out, meets a guy at a club and boom! Next day she has an NFL client who wants nothing to do with her. She deals with adult tempertantrums, irritable coaches, a semi-creepy go-to guy that seems to have come out of a mobster movie, and a cute physical trainer who got her into this mess.Truthfully, this mess is the best thing that could have happened to her, her kids, and even her mom, on occasion."
5,Consistently Interesting Series,"Have thoroughly enjoyed the series, came upon it by accident and was hooked by the third episode, especially enjoyed watching the development of characters, well done."
4,"Mostly good, some songs are so-so","First song [was unacceptable], ballads were OK, the majority of songs was very good. Almost as good of an album as ""Victory"" and ""The 1st Album"""
2,Not The Best but still Good,"I have all MT Albums. I have to say that their last three albums have been a bit of a dissapointment to me. Of course newcomers might not know their ""old"" style which surely is magnificent to some. I believe Victory was a bit better than Universe but still each album has some catchy songs. Their last album that was a pleasure to keep hearing was Year Of The Dragon. I believe from their return that ""ALONE"" and ""YEAR OF THE DRAGON"" had that catchy sound that you keep wanting to hear over and over again. From this album I really like the songs I'm No Rockefeller and Superstar. I am possitive though that these remarks that fans make will have surely have an impact to MT next albums which surely will be much much better since talent is never lost."
2,Cheap and flimsy,"This rack is inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. It's constructed of very thin gauge wire and flexes VERY easily. It's really flimsy and the construction and welding is very low quality. Mine isn't even entirely straight. I would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else as it feels very cheap and has limited usefulness for very light baked items. I was not happy with this purchase and ended up buying another rack for just a couple of dollars more that is very sturdy and will last a lifetime."
2,Not happy customer,I often buy stuff online especially from amazon because I feel they are reliable was not happy at all with this purchase. Since the picture showed two racks I thought it came with two which was my mistake however I did expect to get a rack that was not broke already the day I got it. I opened the package and the cooling rack had a bent and broken wire. Whats the point of a cooling rack if its broken and my cupcakes will fall through. :(
3,You get only one,"Although the product page states ""Fox Run Cooling Racks"" and the picture shows two, you only get one. Also the measurements are approximate. 14.25 inches wide which makes a difference for my intended use."
5,Solid piece,"I've ordered others that were poorly made (metal attached crookedly, etc) but this one was nice. Feels solid in your hands so you can tell it is well made. Does a nice job draining fried foods so that the crust stays crispy as well."
5,Baking/Cooling Racks,"After months of searching for grid cooling racks that can also be used in the oven to keep things crispy and let all that nasty grease drip off, I finally found them at Amazon.com for a great price. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Used in a Smoker as a charcoal grate,"I ordered this to use in our new smoker as a grate to keep the wood and charcoal out of the ash. After I trimmed it to fit a circle pattern, it works great."
5,Good learning reference for biology,"This resource made biology easier to learn and more fun to learn. It is very helpful especially when biology teachers tend to be a little boring and hard to listen to. Another biology reference that I found helpful was:The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations Volume 1 and Volume 2 by Patrick LeonardiThese two volumes made learning the five kingdoms, genetics, plant form and function and heredity easier. It had great study questions. I recommend these 3 books."
5,Could Picture it All,"Being a huge Noel Barber fan already, this is an easy review to write. His descriptive writing intertwined with real life events ALWAYS makes me feel like I am so very honoured to experience these events once again. You can, in your mind, picture each character and location...and FEEL what they are feeling as the story unfolds. I had read this years ago, (paper version), and just felt the need to experience it again. I highly recommend this, and all other Noel Barber books you can find..they transport you to another time."
5,Cookbook,"I got this for my husband since being diagnosed with diabetes. It has many good sounding recipes which he wants to try, but we haven't yet. The recipes appear fairly easy to make with ""normal"" ingredients that we like."
5,Soul Food Cookbook,Excellent cookbook for diabetics. I have tried several recipes and they were excellent. I would advise anyone with diabetes to give it a try.
2,Not Happy,It was to much to read before you get to the recipes and there was not enough picture of the actual recipes and the pictures i did see looked nasty and tasteless i was not happy. You eat with your eyes first and i was not inspired to try any of the recipes being a diabetic dose not mean we have to eat nasty food
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this book and have tried a number of recipes in it. I realize lots of people have different palates. After the first few, I figured perhaps it was just me, but after a number of them, now I'm disappointed.I expected tastier food than is prepared if I follow the recipes the way they're written.MAC"
4,healthy living,a way to try & help my mother change her life...I WORKS..a start is better than nothing. especially for diabetics
2,the world of the witches,this book gives an overview of witchcraft in many forms and how it has been viewed over the centuries by differing religius sects. a long read but good to balance out the positive and negative views of outsiders to the craft.
4,Works very well for what it is supposed to do,"I have used several of these batteries for many years in the intended line of work. Powering Sevylor low thrust trolling motors, ie 5/10lb and 12lb thrust. This is a 7Ah battery that weights 6lbs. Most of the time (depending on the thrust setting) I can run for 1.5 - 3.5hrs per charge. With a spare battery in the boat it keeps me always safe and within a reach of the lake shore.I do have a Minn Kota 30lb motor, and the user manual recommends a 105Ah battery that weights 70lbs. My guess is that a 40lb version needs a 140Ah battery that weights 100lbs. Please do not replace a 140Ah/100lbs battery with a 7Ah/6lbs one and expect it to last more then 10-15 minutes!!!"
4,A battery that fits the product.,"This battery was designed and made to fit and run the motor for the Sevylor rubber inflateable boat. I found it to be the only one to fit the product. The charge is long lasting, as long as one is not going out for several hours, and a compliment to the boat."
1,Short Range,"I used this battery with my Minn Kota 40lb. thrust trolling motor and it lasted for about 1,000 yards. It ran at full speed the first half and then faded to nothing."
3,An Hour of Power...,Was the maximum time I could get this thing to power a small Sevylor motor on a 9 foot raft. Six trips on six charges yielded about 45 to 60 minutes of power. Not bad for its size but I will be buying a larger battery for next summer's camping trips.
5,A well researched look at the Civil War in the west.,"Sam Elliott has brought to life an overlooked general from the Confederacy. As the highest ranking officer to serve the South from Tennessee, General Alexander P. Stewart was one of the few and lucky individuals to survive the entire western campaign. Soldier of Tennessee gives the reader a wonderful cronological look at the war in Tennessee and intoduces us to one of the most respected men in the Southern army. Not only does Elliott present a thorough description of most of the western campaigns, but he is also able to capture the human struggle of a battered Confederate army. This is a must for any Civil War enthusiast."
4,How Big Bang Theory impacted astrophysicists perspective of the First Cause,This book gave me insight into the history of the progress of the big bang theory and how it impacted the scientific community.
3,great but a bit small,"This is a great idea and a great mat...but we have a ford escape and it didn't fit the entire seat. I know it won't fit most bigger cars. It fit perfect under the car seats to protect the seat from the car seat however it didn't cover much of the actual seat to protect from little messes. I do love that it spans across the entire back. We have 2 seats and it protects between the 2 seat great. I love that it is washable, I have washed it 2x now and it held up just fine. The little pouch that hangs off the front was great for me but not the kids. They can't obviously reach anything in it...and if you put to much in the pouch, since it is on by velcro it came off. I like the mat it is working fine for us but may not work well for others ;o)"
2,Get something else!,"I bought this because with 2 kids, you need a double mat! This mat doesn't even cover the seat of our Suburu Outback!! The edges of the seat are still visible and end up filthy. I've tried placing it just right but as soon as my daughter sits in her booster the mat exposes the edge of the seat. Also, THIS MAT IS NOT WATER RESISTANT, WATERPROOF, NOTHING!!! It doesn't claim to be but you would think it would be somewhat resistant to small spills and such. My son got sick in the car when I pulled into the driveway and only a VERY small amount ended up on the backseat. In the 20 to 30 seconds it took me to take him out it had gone through the mat onto the backseat. So even with it covered I STILL had to shampoo the backseat!!! I gave it 2 stars because it did cover most of the seat but save yourself the headache and buy something else!"
3,cute... sent wrong size,looked good but too small. not what size I ordered. had to give to my sister in law. she likes them
3,Chaplin experiments that fell a bit short.,"A Woman of Paris:A solid drama about the dangers of being ""sophisticated"". Dramas of mundane existence didn't seem to find their voice, so to speak, until the advent of sound in cinema. It's just an extremely difficult genre to execute successfully in silent film, depending as it does more on dialogue than the more melodramatic action, spectacle, and comedy which made for successful silent films.A King in New York:A bit self-indulgent and lacking the snap of Chaplin at his best, but historically interesting and consistently amusing."
2,Chaplin Misfire,"""A King in New York"" (1957) is a misguided political satire from Charlie Chaplin that lacks the deft serio-comic touch of ""Modern Times"" and ""The Great Dictator."" Chaplin's final starring feature (made five years after his exile from America) revels in shoddy filmmaking and stale gags. Furthermore, the King Shahdov character has none of Monsieur Verdoux's sardonic charm - he's simply a bitter, aging Charlie sans makeup. Though ""A King in New York"" is fascinating to watch from an academic standpoint, one wishes Chaplin had ended his film career with ""Limelight."""
1,Don't buy this,"Don't get this game. It's graphics are OK, and the high-tech atmosphere is too. The view is awful. You can't turn your view and it's hard to see what's in front of you sometimes. There's no in-game saves, and you have to start the level over again when you quit. I quit and saved, and it didn't show anything that I had accomplished. The game doesn't explain what you have to do too much, so it's a ""what do i do?"" kind of game. This is a waste of money, and if you're a major platform gamer, this is just an old role-play game. If you want something to play, play Ratchet and Clank. I guarantee Ratchet and Clank is the game of the decade. Sly Cooper and Jak and Daxter are worth it too."
3,"If you like Jimmy, you'll like this.","This, being an old game, doesn't have top notch graphics, but they are fine. The gameplay can have its challanges, but overall is normal level. If you like Jimmy Neutron, you'll like this game. It is fun, and takes skill and thinking. You have to be able to be patient with the game because ocassionally, it can be tricky to pass a level and may take several atempts. This game is best for kids ages 7-8+ because it can be tricky at times."
2,Item sent was not the item pictured,"The item I recieved was Jimmy Neutron: Jet Fusion, and not Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.I guess you could say that I was a little more than dissapointed. I specifically bought this game to relive the memories I had playing it as a little kid, and when I got this, I wasn't very happy..."
1,The Invisible Woman,"The book is trash, its boring... who wants to read this crap... Pick up somethig like how to talk to libral (If you must) now thats a good read"
5,Another great book by Nicole,"What a terrific book! I would highly recommend it, especially to stay-home moms and wives. It really puts into words some of the frustrations I've had during my time at home. Nicole is such a gifted dramatist and writer. You need this in your bookcase."
5,an oldie but a goodie,"An authoritative and comprehensive review of the subject. A must read for newbies, and a frequently accessed resource for more experienced modelers. Also very interesting descriptions of how steam engines work. They are more complicated than appears from the rather simple mechanicals. I was repeatedly borrowing it from the library, but it is so nice to have my own copy now."
3,It's a catalog for Mini-Mania,"Several interesting chapters but this book is written by an amateur writer with poor grammar and many misspelled words. Glossy like a magazine with lots of subtle advertising. Lots of discussion of aftermarket parts and their cost and where to find them. If you are looking for guidance in upgrading the engine, drive train, brakes, suspension, tiires and wheels then this is probably for you."
2,Didn't Enjoy It At All,I didn't like this trilogy. This was the best one but it was still awful. Not going into the plot. Amazon does that for me but this book was boring. I hate the Lando sections. Just wasn't exciting and other than the story of Chewie and his son didn't further the characters. I don't recommend you get this book unless you've suffered through the other two in the trilogy and want to find out how it ends.
1,Avoid these books,"The problem with this trilogy is that none of the lead characters were acting in character. Leia was indecisive and unwilling to make a public stand (until the very end), Luke was a befuddled loser. And the ending was awful. Nothing particularly was resolved, no one (aside from Chewbacca) did anything particularly heroic. The Lando subplot went nowhere, as did the Luke subplot. Avoid this trilogy."
4,"good, maybe not great, but good.","I think this is a very good trilogy. The second book's three section split between Lando, Luke, and Leia probably wasn't all that ""booklike"", but it made you want to get the next book and read it to find out what happens. Over all I think it was a very good trilogy. I would recomend to all my fellow Star Wars fans."
2,McDowell seems afraid to change the Star Wars Universe,"In the final book of the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy,there are a few too many questions left unanswered. For example, the suspected Elomin spy in Shield of Lies never appears, or is given any thought to. And Senator Peramis never is caught, as if New Republic Intellegence forgot about him. Also, in most other trilogies, authors usually develop both a good guy and a bad guy. For example, Timothy Zahn introduces Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Thrawn. Kevin J. Anderson introduces Admiral Daala and Kyp Durron. A.C. Crespin has Teroenza and Brea. But who does McDowell have? Nil Spaar and who? Tarrick and Alole? Everyone else has been introduced well before the story was written."
1,YEEEEESSSSSS it's FINALLY OVER!,"This entire trilogy only has one redeeming value: it EVENTUALLY ends. The character development (with the possible exception of Leia) is very poor. The plots are all very poor, and never quite tie in with each other. Lando's plot was particularly infuriating because he never actually does anything. The tactical aspect of the books were the worst depictions of battles in Star Wars I have ever had the displeasure of reading, and most of the time there never even was any fighting. Why is Han taken from the trilogy so early? Why do I care if Luke finds a mother that isn't even his? Why should I plunk down my hard earned money to pay for a book that fits so nicely in a trash can or a bonn fire?Buy Heir to the Empire or the Jedi Academy trilogy instead. Actually, buy ANYTHING else."
1,The worst Star Wars book I have read,"To keep this shot. The characters are ALL Wrong, Luke is reduced to a wimp , Lando is stuck in some ship and the plot of that story is meaninless to the rest of the book. Then the big battle that could have been the only good point turned in to the biggest flop of the story.Stay away"
1,Incoherent and unambitious,"After the first two volumes I was expexcting ""le grand finale"" Sadly It never came. The climax resolved in an huge anticlimax where the wonderful villain vanished without taking on the entire galaxy... Expecting that all the different ties and side stories would be concluded, and summed up I disappointly found out that I have been spending reading at least 200 pages on a side story without any reference to the main story. What a disaster. I could have been in its on book...The buildup in the first two volumes is great but it all collapses with the final book. Sadly."
1,Lets down expectations,"I started the Black Fleet Crisis books interested. As the trilogy progressed, however, the book got more turgid, the characters acted less and less like their movie counterparts, and the plot got more and more ridiculous. I might have given this book two stars if the first book hadn't given me such high hopes for the series."
1,Just plain bad!,"The Black Fleet CrisisThe good:Well there is not much in favor of the black fleet crisis trilogy.Maybe the conflict Luke has with the use of the force is interesting.The bad:Mr. Kube-McDowell should have taken more time understanding the characters. Lea is a dictator, Luke by now a Jedi master is confused and the droids act like teenagers. The overall storyline is a copy of the same theme others used.Lost fleet an aggressive species come on be original! Finally what is this circle crap?Conclusion:Please Mr. Kube-McDowell don't spoil the universe!"
3,"Good, But Not Great","This book was, like my one-liner summary, good but not great. The only plot that really interested me was the diplomatic and military angles of the Yevethan conflict. The ruthlessness of the Yevethan Viceroy Nil Spaar and the action the results from the NR Fleet taking on the Yevethan Thrustships is really great. But the ""Luke goes off with this girl on a wild goose chase across the parsecs to find his mother"" and ""Lando and the droids find out all about the vagabond through Lobot's interface"" really ticks me off. I mean, what the heck was this guy thinking? I really would've given this book 4 or 5 stars if it were the Yevethan conflict alone, but the Lando and Luke plot crap-o-rama really sucked all the magic out of the SW universe."
3,Good end to Bad trilogy,"Ok, so it is finally over. For such a bad series the end was good. It makes much more sense now (not). The only thing that really made sense was the fact that Luke was searching for his mother and basically it boils down to the fact that he was lied to. He went on a wild goose chase. The author did a really bad job with all of the characters except for Chewie and Lando. Luke would never act like that and Leia (it was worse than the other two and that is saying a lot). In the first two books the author didnt do a bad job with Han, but he really was not in the much. But this time he was it quite a bit, he gets kidnapped (Han Solo kidnapped, you have got to be kidding). All and all I would say skip this series it really has no connection to the rest of the star wars universe."
3,"Good, but plot lines disconnected","I thought this book was a good wrap up for the series, and overall the series was well written and imaginative. However, I felt that several of the plot lines didn't properly connect in the end. The only similarity being the appearence of one character, rather than an emersive overlying story. If you like Star Wars novels, this book will be good, and you will enjoy it. If not, you might want to look into something else. Also, some people might be slighlty disturbed (like me) by the ""Don't kill a fly"" even if its gonna kill you attitude some of the characters have."
1,No Force with this one,"Usually I review Star Wars novels differently from other books I read, my love for the series is that great. But this book, no matter how you cut it, is absolute crappolla. Awful plot, useless supporting characters, bad dialogue, and the worst excuse for a Jedi-type religion ever. Mr Kube-McDowell, go back to school and get writing lessons - now!!!"
2,Out of many bad Star Wars books this one is one of the worst,"People who say that Star Wars expanded universe fiction hit the skids with the New Jedi Order series obviously don't remember this book. The one bright spot in this whole affair a face of aliens who don't think of the force in terms of light or dark but rather as in the color of a rainbow is good but unfortunately never really developed.I submit that while the Cornelian Crisis has a stupider villain and children of jedi has a more idiotic supporting cast the black fleet crisis has more useless dialog. You have to buy this one for the immortal line ""have you ever had sex in hyperspace"
3,TYRANT'S TEST,WHILE THE ENTIRE BLACK FLEET CRISIS WAS NOT BAD IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CALLED STARWARS. TO MANY ELEMENTS WERE NOT THERE.FIRST CHEWIE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HAN'S SIDE FOR ANYTHING IN THE GALAXY. SECONDLY LEAS WOULD NEVER GO OFF THE DEEP END LIKE SHE DID. THIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER TITLE TO IT AND NOT A STAR WARS LABEL.
1,Stay away,This entire trilogy was terrible! All the characters were done so...I cant even describe it. And what was the deal with that Lando sub plot? Please!
1,Stay away at all costs!,"To put it bluntly, this trilogy really, really stinks. Kube-McDowell might as well have been writing three different plots, and not very good ones. Give me a break. Lando and the droids invade this living spaceship and try to figure out it's mysteries. Luke's off on some trip trying to find his mom or something. And in the middle of all this the Republic finds a nemesis in the Yevetha. And none of them really has a conclusion. Everyone is out of character (except maybe Chewie). Luke is a twit, Han's pretty respectable, and Leia is so indescisive it's not funny. I love Star Wars a lot, and I rarely think of any books as bad, especially Star Wars books. But this, on the other hand, is the worst book I have ever read in my life. Do yourself a favor and don't touch it."
1,Disapointed.,Tyrant's Test and Shield of Lies are terrible. They killed this series that started out so greatly built up in Before the Storm. And I thought Children of the Jedi was the worst.
3,Is it really nessicary to include every charactor?,"I really loved the plot involving the problems with Viceroy Nils Sparr, and felt that was one on the best contribution to the Star Wars Library so far. But Lando and the droids little cross galaxy jaunt had no real relationship to the main plot, it seemed like just a trick to include those charactors, the same goes for the majority of Luke's quest for his mother. ... (Still I have to recommend this series, it's an excellent read, with great charactor developement, and the ending doesn't negate that.)"
4,"one of the detroit three, back again","When you make out your list of techno innovators, Kevin Saunderson finds a place near the top. There wouldn't be Detroit techno without Saunderson, Mays, or Atkins. This CD is representative of updated Saunderson. If you listen to this and his 'Faces and Phases' retrospective, you'll notice several updated tracks. From that perspective, this album isn't essential on its own. But, these updates are generally of far greater quality, edge, and use to techno/house DJ's. If you don't know Saunderson, get the X-Mix 'Transmissions from Deep Space' -- maybe the best late 90's techno mix there is!"
1,Cameras and Cables Missing From Box,When I received the package all the cameras and cables were missing. When I contacted Beach Audio they blamed the supplier Lorex. All I know is that I was cheated out of four cameras and four cables. In the future I will avoid Lorex and Beach Audio....
2,Teological view,"I don't like the racist, teological view in there. The Teutonic subdued in a harsh war the pagan Baltic Prussians in the 13th century, but unlike what Anglo-Americans did to the Indians, did not exterminate most. Those who converted to Christianity were treated like the German settlers the Teutonic Knights brought in. The Prussian language died out in the late 17th century, after their intermarriage with the Germans. Hundreds of thousands of East Prussians descended from the old Baltic Prussians, as can be seen from their surnames. I am, a.e., a descendant of that merger, as well.The data in the book is very useful. The conclusions drawn from the data much less so, they are colorable, according to whether you hate Germans for being Germans, or not."
3,Very nice for a first try,It is a good book for a first try if it is a first novel for this author. The main reason I bought it was because it featured a Keeshond on the cover and in the book. I am a Keeshond obsessed person as the author is and own 2 Keeshonden currently. All the Keeshond antics are true to life and never failed to bring a smile to my face while reading. It made the book seem that it was written just for me. So for Kees owners I say this book should definitely be on their reading list.
4,Great Storytelling...,"I love the Cape, actress Julie Harris, and shipwrecks have always fascinated me. There are some great books out there, like Bill Quinn's pictorial hardcovers, but nothing on film like this. I loved hearing all the obscure details of the wrecks and actually getting first-hand interviews from the experts themselves.This video came out in 1995 but still holds up and is a great watch, at an hour long, for anyone interested in Cape Cod or New England maritime history."
3,Incomplete History,Very good history of the war in the the north but lacks depth on southern colonies . Could not recommend for serious student of history.
3,Pretty good,"This movie was pretty good. Realistic in a sense. I should know, I gamble a lot on sports. I think i might even be considered to have a problem with gambling. Oh well. Anyway, i dont think this movie is worth buying. just rent it."
2,Don't even open if it was a Christmas gift,Good supporting actors...bad plot.You'll wish the movies run time was even shorter.
3,Good idea but ....................,"The idea behind the movie was good, but the story was hard to follow. The ending was poorly thought out. The underlying plot of a bookie taking equal action on any game that was on the board makes the bookie an easy 10%."
5,Very nice selection of tracks,"For several years, I was looking all over the Web just to find this particular sampler. And boy, it is a good thing I found it. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of songs, from Phillippe Saiss to Down to the Bone and Al Jarreau along with Diana Krall and even Yanni made an appearance.Considering how scarce this CD was for several years, I wish true jazz fans the very best of luck in hoping to secure their own copies from a formerly great jazz station in Chicago."
4,A rock solid debut!,"In Tommy Cutter's spectacular debut, it reads like a screenplay for ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer""; suspenseful and a gripping white-knuckle read.The characters could have been fleshed out a little better, which would have made the book a bit longer than 168 pages; probably the only real negative thing I can say about the book.It was an interesting story about six medical students who study for and dissect a dead body that doesn't appreciate being cut open.As each part of the body gets cut, a student dies in a similar way.Soon the body count gets pretty high and only three people are left.I absolutely loved the way this book read; like a movie was unfolding in my brain as I gobbled it up. I do believe Tommy Cutter will receive a publishing contract from one of the major publication house's and then sell the movie rights.Kudos Mr Cutter, you keep us self-publishing writers hope and the chance to dream big!"
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best or the best book on satanism ever written. It's a shame it's out of print. this is a must-have for occultists and Christians, who will learn negative accustions against satanism are patently untrue. I enjoyed the chapters on Crowley, LaVey and the Temple of Set the most, though the Crowley chapter should've been longer. Aquino left the Church of Satan partially because LaVey was selling priesthoods wheras Aquino thought it should be on basis of magickal merit. Also Aquino didn't put anything on world merit in satanists where LaVey drew on popular entertainers and respectable world jobs. Satanic serial killers are covered, as are witch hunts. This book is excellent, and holds a very high place in my occult library."
3,Could be better,This is my third unit and I am still getting the same error codes as the previous models from Lorex. Now my main Lorex surveillance system just went out too. Not pleased. This unit recorded nicely though when it was not messing up...
4,Quakers and Slavery in North Carolina,"Once Quakers in America discerned that slavery was an evil inconsistent with their Christian faith (c. 1776), they faced an ongoing problem of how to live ethically in those areas where slavery became an ever-increasingly important part of the economy and the culture. Various tactics used by Quakers in North Carolina to free slaves were counteracted by the state government, which made it easy for others to re-enslave any person freed by the Quakers. Eventually a large proportion of the Quakers in North Carolina emigrated to the free territories in the Midwest, including Ohio and Indiana. This is a fascinating but little-know story."
1,Unbearable,This should have been thrown into the rubbish bin upon completion. Worst DOA record of all. I think most of the fans of the band would like to overlook this mess.
5,Unbreakable - Big Come Back for DOA !!,"Despite all the bad reviews been written on this album, I seriously think we should give the Japanese the CREDIT to release such a ""come back/remixed"" album for DOA.I love all the tracks in there.Surprising to hear such good works from DOA after so many years.Get this FANTASTIC album if you are a die-hard DOA fan like myself!"
2,Not so much....,"I love Dead or Alive and consider myself a die-hard fan. That being said, this is one of the most horrific albums I have ever heard, by any group. The mixes are cheesey and out of date. I realize this album was made years ago but this type of techno was over when the album was released. Who are these second rate remixers?? Please release some new music DOA or hang up the wig. I love ""You Spin Me Round"" but really? another remix?"
3,Well..........,I only bought this because i collect all of there stuff...do i listen to it...NO...its not one of my favourites but it isnt all bad either.....It just sounds like a huge car crash too me...if you are a die hard DOA fan then it is a must have...just for your collection...
2,Pete rocks but...,"I love DOA just as much as as the next fan, but c'mon already, these 'remixes' of FRAGILE tracks are, sadly, lame, uninspired, and downright tacky. DOA needs to be allowed to release a brand-NEW studio album, not continually glut the saturated market with even more tired remixes and dated rehashes - and this coming from someone who owns ALL their stuff. Better to support Pete's new single, ""JACK AND JILL PARTY"" hoping for a new DOA album, or at the very least, maybe a SOLO album by Mr. Burns?"
2,Caution!,"Dead or Alive will always be a fav' of mine. Pete Burns is certainly unconventional, yet intriguingly sexy all rolled into one, but this cd leaves something to be desired. The tracks are old and rather blah, not to mention the harsh quality of the music which sounds as if it's being played on some dirt cheap music box with the volume turned all the way up. And NO, I don't own some dirt cheap music box.Nonetheless, I suppose this cd is a must have for all those die-hard DOA fans. Heck, I've added it to my collection. The price is a little high for something I don't listen to very often, but I do like that it's an import with Japanese writing on the jewel case sleeve."
5,The Queen of Salsoul Sensation Exposure,"People Don't understand music,Loleatta Holloway put so much energy in her singing,till it makes me upset that she is not known today. I live in Jacksonville Florida, they don't know her or Salsoul music. I discover her through The Salsoul Orchestra song titled ""Runaway"" in 2005. I started to chase her work though Salsoul and the late great Norman Harris.I'm only 37 years old, I know what real music is,and supposed to feel like. That what this album is. You won't regret it. I't worth every dollar and cents. I just fell in love with Salsoul music period. It's not on the radio at all in Jacksonville florida,I can't get enough Playing Loleatta Holloway's ""Catch Me On The Rebound"" 10 min. long. DYNAMITE!!!!!! Till That's becoming my phase to everybody ""CATCH ME ON THE REBOUND""!!!!!!"
4,Huge improvement over Classic Creep Capers,"You always fear a licensed console game these days. For an example, rent Classic Creep Capers. If you were over 5 years old, you probably didn't enjoy it all that much. So I was a bit fearful when renting this one. Much to my surprise, it was very enjoyable. There are obvious technical problems to it. There is marked slowdown throughout when Shaggy or Scooby is running. The enemies do get to be redundant. It actually reminds me of a lower quality Crash Bandicoot game. Still, as far as licensed platformers go, it is fun. For Scooby fans out there, it's well worth checking out and probably even worth shelling out the 30 clams for. There is enough to it to have some decent replay value. If it is for somebody 8-10 years old, I'd bet they love it."
3,it's fun til level 2,"i got this game cuz i liked the movie,yes im a big kid,this has almost none of the levels as the movie an you can only play shaggy an scooby.if a 26 yr old can't get past level to how is a 5-7 yr old supposed too? It's got good graphics though an level 1 chapters 1-3 we're fun. Yes there are about 9 levels each with 3 sub levels before you can move on to the next level"
4,Great plan and great cell phone,"Shipping is fast. The phone was great. I got the rebate. I think getting a new cell phone lines from amazon is great, the only problem is that if you already have a cell phone, it is kind of hard to keep your old number. rather than that, it is outstanding."
2,Works well but has a SERIOUS design flaw,"The Hot Pot heats water quite quickly but has a serious design flaw that is almost guaranteed to cause painful burns. If water is heated to boiling and you then pour from the pot with the lid on (it is clearly designed to be used that way), steam emerges from under the lid DIRECTLY and painfully onto your hand. There are flanges spaced around the underside of the edge of the lid to hold it in place in the pot; one of the larger openings between the flanges directs the steam onto your hand. Its a terrible design oversight. Hide the lid."
3,I wash it...it shrunk and not is too small,I bought this hat many years ago and still looks great. But I decided to wash it and shrunk so much I cannot wear it anymore. The stitches are intact and the leader looks good it just shrunk so much is now an XS when it was an M.
4,EBook is best way to go,"Lots of wisdom in this e-book, and so easy to carry around. All books will be this way in a few years ;-)"
4,Good for a person that wants the history,"I have been looking for a good bible handbook since I picked up the bible. New Unger's is for the person that wants the history side and archaeological side of the text. I personally wasn't aware that it would go into such detail. The book goes through each book of the bible almost verse by verse. Mr. Unger describes the meaning of the verse or the archaeological side of it. It is full of pictures, maps, and graphs. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because if you have a study bible like the Quest Study Bible which I recommend it goes through it enough for me. But if you like graphs, maps, and pictures this is for you. I think that I wont pick it up off my shelf once I'm done with it unless I want to see some picture of the place I'm reading about or if I want to lend it to a friend that is into the archaeological side of the bible."
3,Very Concise yet helpful to laypeople,"I found this handbook not very helpful to seminary student. I might be very helpful to layperson who is looking for basic information about the historical and cultural background of the books of the Bible. The Outlines are very short, the introductions of each book are too short, not enough information. Again I think it would be helpful to a layperson."
4,Not for beginners,This book is for people that already know a fair amount about the bible. Not great for beginners.
5,Simply Amazing,My mom had been talking about this Handbook ever since someone recommended it to her. She asked me to find it online since in the store they wanted almost $40. The price was great on Amazon so i brought it for her and she loves it. Everyone she shows it to loves it and wants it for themselves. She finds it to be extremely helpful.
2,Really,Once again I feel like the ingredient required aren't included in this product. It's not 100% as Dr Oz required.
2,Read serving size,"Product was shipped quickly & is as shown. The label is deceiving though,it shows CLA-1000, which one would assume each capsule was 1000mg. Not so. 2 caps = 1000mg. This would have changed the price comparision a great deal."
1,A crock of [],"This item should not even be rated a one star it should have never been able to be released. First you have to load software everytime before you get to play. Plus in isn't liecensed by Sony so I wouldn't buy it for that reason alone. If you were to screw up your PS2 your just *&cked. Maybe it is 16 MB but I would go with the 8 MB Sony card. It is quicker to get to your games, not to mention more convinent."
1,I hate this mem card,"I purchased this memory card without looking at the reviews. I bought a PS2 so that I could turn on the power, put in a game and start playing. Now though, I have to turn on the power, load some memory management software from a cd, go through a menu to tell the new software that I want to run a game, put in my game cd and then I finally get to play my game. The added bonus is that I play a game and then save the game data, turn off the system, come back the next day and find that I can see the game data, but my game cannot load the data from the card (yes I had to reload the memory management software)."
2,Pain To Use,"Memory Cards using the Mega Memory Manager are a bit of a pain to use. You have to load the memory software everytime you reset the PS2. That means everytime you load a game or switch games, you have to put in the Memory Manager disk, let it load, and then launch the next game out of the software. It can be quite annoying, especially if you forget to do it. Your memory card won't be recognized and you have to start all over. I just wish using the card was a bit more convenient than this process."
1,No Stars mean CRUDDY.,"I just purchased my PS2 at th begining of the month and with it I got Final Fantasy X (awesome game) and with it this "" One of a kind 16MB menory card"". I did as the directions stated on the card, insterted the disc ( which I still don't know how to use) an then popped in FFX. I found out that the game dosen't recognize the memory card, so I was left dangling, trying to figure out how to save. For those of you who are FF fans, you know how hard it is to go through a whole game without any memory card{s}. I went to bed at nights upset from spending my saterday getting REALLY far in the game and then having to shut it of and start all over again. The memory card does state on the packaging that you need to install the progrm first (I think ??) but doesn't give you clear directions on how to. Overall just don't think about buying this card. Oh and by the way that person from Illinois who gave this game ***** (five stars) what's he talking about?"
1,it's horrible,"i've read other people's reviews of this thing and their thoughts about it are similar to mine, except for the person in Hawaii who thinks it's awesome. Somebody said that it didn't save their GTA3 game, it doesn't save mine either. Nor does it save my Metal Gear Solid 2 game. I've been trying to exchange it for an 8MB card but none are EVER in stock ANYWHERE so i just got the money back. The Memory Manager ... that u must load every single time u are going to play a different game or reset your console is a total waste of time as well. I've done everything the little ... instruction manual says to do and the games still say that there is no memory card inserted. please do yourself a favor and buy an 8MB card instead, it is more than enough memory for ur games and EXTREMELY more convenient and less of a hassle."
1,A pain to use,"The packaging should state more clearly that you must use their memory management software to use the card. What if I want to take the card to work with me to play on our PS2 in the game room? I have to take the disc with me. Even if I wanted to deal with that, they don't supply a holder for the disc.I'm going back to the standard PS2 8MB memory cards. This bites. Why can't the software be optional InterAct? Or why can't you have it be on the card itself. There is such a thing as embedded controller chips. The PS2 supplies your power anyways!"
1,DONT BUY THIS ITS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!,this product is HORRIBLE you need a disc to access it EVERYTIME your ps2 is reset or turned off. my friends system accually broke from this product. so spent the extra $ for the sony one! STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!
1,THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE THIS MEMORY CARD YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A SEPERATE DISC AND LOAD IT! IT [STINKS]!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ME A FAVOR AND STICK WITH A 8MB SONY MEMORY CARD. YOUR NOT ONLY DOING ME A FAVOR, BUT GOD AS WELL. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
1,The mini disc is what makes this suck.,"Both the 16MB and 8MBversion are wastes of time.I was so annoyed at finding that I have to actuallygo over to the PS2, take out my game, turn it on withthe minidisc and then wait for it to load, then take thedarn thing out and secure it, THEN get my game out. Justabout the lamest thing I have ever seen.Stay away."
1,waste of time and source of frustrations,"this thing is absolute junk, in general buying 3rd party hardware is a bad idea, and this product epitomizes that. Refuses to save some games at all, corrupted all the memory on the card at one point and lost all my data. Not to mention that stupid cd you have to load so the system has the drivers for the ... thing. If you desperatly need a card, (since sony isnt shipping peripherals for the PS2 right now) make sure it uses magic gate technology and go with a 3rd party card that is certified by sony for use in the PS2. Nyko makes a good one that are floating around some retail stores. Its only 8MB but so are sony ones so you arent really losing much there. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I would rather not save my games than have to deal with this thing."
1,No Micro Code...,"The micro code for this memory card isn't in the playstation2 firmware. You have to run a special CD every time you reset the playstation or you can't access the memory. Loose the CD, you loose what's stored on the card.What a piece of garbage....I returned it."
1,16MB Memory Card,"I recently bought a PS2. When I bought the console, I also purchased this 16MB memory card because it was cheap, had a lot of memory, and was the only one the store had at the time. When I got home, I put in 007 Agent Under Fire and the memory card. When I tried to play my game, the memory card wouldn't work. I printed some instructions from Interact's website, and I discovered that you had to use the disc that came with the memory card every time you wanted to turned off the PS2. I tried to get it to work, and it didn't work this time either. I took it back the next day and got my money back.This memory card is CRAP! I then bought a Sony-made 8MB memory card. Pay $5 more, and get the 8MB memory card. You can save without the hassle, and you can fit over 9 games to one card! Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Works sometimes,"OK. I understand how this works, and that you have to load the disk everytime, but before you buy this, be aware that it won't work with all games. I've gotten it to work with GT3, Red Faction, and SSX. But, I can't get it to work with Madden 2002, Grand Theft Auto 3, or Tony Hawk 3. I would suggest you purchase this card as a backup for another memory card just for space issues, but it should not be your only memory card."
1,"Thanks for losing my game info, twice","I've had this card for a week, and I'm going to return it after work today. I've been playing GTA3 and this card has initialized itself twice in under a week. The first time I thought nothing of it, reformatted it using the instructions, and started my game again. Went to save for the third time, and the card was no longer formatted. Thanks for the waste of my time."
2,"Not Completely Useless, but a Real Pain to Use","I purchased one of these because it was the only card in stock and I naively figured that the memory manager wasn't a hard requirement. Was I ever wrong.Not only must you load the mini-cd EVERY time you use the card no matter what, but the cd won't stay in the tray if you have the PS2 on a stand. Extra memory management is nice I guess, but having to load the CD is really too much trouble. I'd have rather seen something that plugs into the expansion bay or something. Maybe the PS2 hard drive will obscelesce this and it can have a bloody removal from the market.Don't buy one of these if you have the option to get something else that doesn't require the memory manager."
4,Is a pretty wise buy...,"I buy one of thi memoty cards for my girlfriend and works fine, i don't like the fact of loading the software but what the hell, its cheaper than a 8Mb Memory Card and with much more space..."
1,Annoying,It is really annoying to have to put the cd everytime the game start....I would get the on without the memeory manager plus and use it right out of the box..
1,Always Buy First-Party Memory Cards...Here's Why...,"Unfortunately, Sony hasn't been able to keep up with memory card demand lately, so us poor saps without one have no choice but to get an alternative, third-party memory card. Borrow a card from a friend instead of buying this one, because this is just awful. If I could give this card a zero rating, I would, since the one I bought was faulty. Get an easier-to-operate Sony card, because with this, you have to load a special disc everytime you play. Resist the temptation if you can't find a Sony card, because this is a waste of your $[money]."
1,Too much of a hassle,"I bought this mempry card and returned it the same day. First of all, the packaging did not state that you have to insert the disc before you start up any game, what a pain in the neck. Secondly, even after following the instructions, the memory card would not work for me anyway. You're much better off paying the extra couple bucks and just getting the Sony Memory card."
2,Extremely Tedious.......but works!,"Considering PS2 cards are like gold these days I broke down and bought this product (After the guy at the electronics store told me not to waste my money). After reading the directions I figured out how to use the thing.Bottom line is it works, BUT you have to load the CD that comes with the card EVERYTIME you change games.So that means, if you play 5 games you have to load the CD, wait for it to load, chose the file, take it out of the PS2 and put in the game. Extremely tedious but it works, so if your desparate for a storage card and can't find one anywhere then buy it. My advice is to try bidding on a PS2 card on ebay and stay away from this card."
1,DO NOT waste your money,"this product goes against the point of making life easy. It's hard enough to pass the games, we don't need a memory card, which is suppose to make life easy, to make things harder. Save your money and buy a memory card that works."
1,Interact Memory Card forgets what it is supposed to do...,Save your money and purchase a Sony Memory Card for PS2. They are slowly but surely making their way into Best Buys. The Interact card is not even worth the shipping and handling price.
1,16MB Memory Card,mine worked but you have to load their software everytime you hit the reset or power button. this is not mentioned on the packaging; should be a law against that...
1,Don't Buy this card!!!,"Repeated savings over files on this card lead to the games being corrupted. I've only had this card for two weeks now and i've had five save files go corrupt. Having to restart ffx when you're almost to the end is a real pain and i'm very disappointed in this card. If you can't find a sony card, buy one of the other 3rd party cards, this should be a last resort!!!"
1,a junk,This is a junk.. never buy this.. very cumbersome.to use.. even worse than junk... I wish I could get my money back along with $ for pain and suffering..
3,ok,I dont use it because i have a 8mb card so i just use that one but i use this one 4 saveing on the games i rent. I got this because i got Final Fantasy X and i couldn't save it because i lend it 2 my friend over christmas break and i was desprate (my friend got FFX 2 thats why i lended him my mem card)(YOU HAVE TO PRESS START THEN LOAD THE GAME FOR YOU THAT THINK THAT THIS DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!)
2,Might have been a great idea....,"In order to use this memory chip you have to load compression software (included) every time before you load the game. Instructions for use are poor at best; it took me 3 or 4 times to get the right screen & push the right button at the right time :-)I'm not sure it will work at all in conjunction with other software such as Gameshark.I suppose if you did alot of heavy gaming using games that require alot of memory it would be worth the extra hassle, but give a regular chip that I can just stick in & play anytime.~ Angel One"
1,16mb memory card by interact,"This is a great product...except for...if you did not have to load the memory manager cd everytime that you turn the game off or reset it. It does not tell you on the package. You have to wait until you spend $35.00 on the thing and get it home to read the directions. Maybe you will get lucky and find someone in the store you are buying from that actually knows about the products he sells. Anyway, it is a great product, and if you have the patience to go through switching discs all the time, then you will like the product. Sorry if some of this review is misspelled or does not make sense....lack of sleep can do that...."
1,Not Compatiable,this item does not work with the playstqation 2 game console. the manufacturer even says so do not buy it.
1,Worst experience purchasing the item,"My purchase is the worst experience I had with Amazom. The seller sent me a materially different item. when i try to file a a-z protection claim, the required listing ID can't be found anywhere."
1,BEWARE - THIS REQUIRES YOU TO LOAD S/W EVERY TIME YOU USE IT,"As others note, this product requires you to load CD software EVERY TIME YOU BOOT UP THE CONSOLE! What a pain in the neck. It would be okay if it was only being used by Adults, but if you have kids using the PS2 console forget it!This is way too much trouble for the value!"
5,Really useful.,"OK first of all this is 10X better than the 8mb card, as it holds twice as much saved data... it DOES NOT mess up your playstation 2. I must have tried it 20 times and havent had one problem. Sure the extra 30 seconds is kind of annoying, but I now have a whole bunch of games saved.This works fine with my 2 games Grand Theft Auto 3 and Final Fantasy 10. Buy this it really is good...This is one of the best memory devices i have ever owned. I highly recomend this over the 8mb memory card..."
1,Don't Buy This Card!!!,"This memory card is BOGUS! you have to load the memory manager software every time you turn on your ps2, and every time you reset the machine, or change games. It is a lot more trouble than it is worth, unless you sit and play one game all the time and never turn your machine off. I bought this product at a local store in my area, and I returned it as fast as I could, trust me and don't waste your time with this product !!!"
3,Works Well,"The product works for me exactly as stated. I can't speak to claims that it doesn't work with certain games because I don't own any of the games that are claimed to be incompatible but I can say that it has worked flawlessly with every game I have thrown at it.And it does NOT take, as one reviewer claimed, five minutes to load the driver. It's more like two.Yes, it's a bit of a hassle to load the driver disk every time and that's the reson I give the card three stars instead of four or five, but it works well and gives you two memory cards for the price of one."
1,BAD,Ok this memory card may hold 16 mb of memory but beleive me its not worth it. You have to put in the little disc every time you turn on the PS2 and its realy annoying. So take my advice and dnt buy this memory card its a huge waist of [money].
1,Will not comply with several games,"This memory card, (and yes, you can load the program to your hearts' content..) will simply NOT work with several games...including Final Fantasy X. In fact, when trying to save with games that it isn't compatible with,this card may very well freeze your PS2 up. Go ahead, stick that stupid card in the slot, load that software,wait for that half minute, bring up that menu, take out that foolish disk, put in that game, press that start button, and watch as nothing happens."
2,not so great,although this has double the capcitiy of a normal memory card why not get the one from Sony. No software requried to load and it works much faster too.
2,pimpgod,when i start my software it did not load and it said disk read error so i wouldint spend it on that unlees can prove me wrong
4,mega memory 16mb,"ijust purchased a ps2 model 50001 and knew i would need memory so i purchased this item. i tried to load the software and it didn't work. I had also purchased the action replay and the same thing, no good. I contacted action replay and told them my problem with the ar max and they sent me a updated disc. To my surprise it worked with both cards."
1,Awful,This is horrible. You have to load a CD to recognize a memory card! Come on. Be more realistic get the blue-red memory card pack like Im doing. It takes about 10 seconds to load. You then have to enter the CD. I bought this for fifty bucks with a weird PS2 controller and a vertical stand. My PS2 even says I need a format CD.I had to get this because I could not find a regular emory card. Do not get this game unless you want to enter a CD and then your game. This is memory card is [not good]!!
1,This thing ...,This thing is worthless because you have to load the CD up that came with the memory card before you play a game. also i found it doesnt work with every game. I bought Medal Of Honor Frontline and cant save my games with the memory card. so i went out and bought an 8MB memory card. And besides who really needs 16 MB of space. Well this was just my opinion i hope it helps someone.
1,Piece of junk--waste of money,"The idea for this memory card is good (double the memory of a standard card and ability to archive saves to Zip disk), but the final product by Interact is extremely poor. The card is a piece of junk, totally unreliable. I unfortunately did not read the reviews posted here and mistakenly bought the card. On the first day of using the card, it stopped working!!! ~4 hours of gameplay down the toilet!!! It was not the PS2 console, since my other card worked. On top of that it did not recognize my Zip drive plugged into the console. Does Interact test their products before selling them??!! If you are considering buying this product, DO NOT BUY IT!!! Do not make the mistake I made. Stick with the Sony memory cards...more $$, but more reliable and less headaches."
1,This piece ... is a piece ...,"Even-though I got it to work, it is such a complicated system that you should bypass it all the way. First, you have to do some crazy [stuff] to get it to work, then put in the ...cd and play a good game only to have this piece ...not found by the system. I don't need ""16mb of storage"". All I needed was the good-ol' sony one and was back to saving my games in notime..."
2,Doesn't work for any PS1 games on PS2,"1) My first problem with the disk is that I can't orient the PS2 on its end to load the mini disk. This is a pain because I usually just leave my console sitting up.2) The second problem is, like many others, that I have to load the MM CD every time to get the 16M cartridge to be recognized.3) Problem 3, I can't get it to work with ANY PS1 games. I haven't read all of the instructions, so I don't know if this is a known feature omission.In general, I had no problems saving my FFX progress which is why I bought it in the first place. That and the fact that there were no PS2 8MB cartridges available anywhere.Overall I can't see giving it only one star... afterall it works for some games, and that's better than no saves at all."
2,"Sure it works, but totally inconvenient","This card will work in a PS2 as long as you load the required software. But you have to do that everytime you start your upyour console or switch games. What a pain!!! This totally cutsinto VALUABLE game playing time! Even if you decide to buy thismemory card, I recommend looking for Sony's 8M card and get oneas soon as you can find one. And stick w/the real deal cardsmade by Sony. I've bought other 3rd party card for my ps1 andhave had only marginal success - Sony's have never failed me."
2,Buyer beware,"While this is a handy and cheap way to store your game files, you have to load the memory manager software that comes with this card every time you reset your PS2. Not just after power cycle but ANY time you reset,from standby or resetting after a game. The documentation on the packaging doesn't really explain this. But with the way stores are selling out of memory cards this is a great ""get by"" until you can get you hands on a real memory card, and a great way to store game save for the games you rarely play."
1,16MB Memory Cards for PS2 are blasphy.,"i bought a 16MB Memory Card at [a local shop] in my town and it works like trash. I bought it for the obvious reason of it being more memory for the same price (as an 8MB card) but it only saves for my Simpsons Road Rage game. It is trash. And you have to install this cd everytime u want to play a game. I don't know if 8MB cards require the same but I'm sure they work better because there's no way they could work any worse. DONT BUY 16MB MEMORY CARDS!!!! BUY 8MB MEMORY CARDS!!! (games don't need much to save anyways...metal gear solid 2 only requires 80kb of memory, that's hardly any at all)"
2,Interact Memory Card - doesn't work on all games,"I concur with the rater who complained about the card not working. There are two problems with this card. First, its inconvenient to insert the disk each time - but I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is that it doesn't work with all games. I have read and reread the directions to see if I'm missing something. I've had the PS2 for 3 weeks, and only have 3 games. The card works fine on two of the games, but won't work with the Jak and Daxter game - the only game that I actually care about the card working. It tries to save, and then come back with an Error. I wouldn't buy it."
2,Memory Card Pains,"The PlayStation 2 is my first experience with gaming and I purchased this memory card since it was the only one that I could find available. The manual was some help and I went online to Interact and found more help. I've been able to get it to work with a couple of my games but I cannot get James Bond 007 to work with it..I've loaded the software first and it just does not recognize the cards. If anyone has any ideas how to get it to work with that piece of software, please send me an email at (...)As soon as I can find a better card, I'll purchase it."
1,Mega Memory 16mb card,"Lots of memory, but I don't like the fact that you have to load the program every time you power up your system. If you want to go from one game to another, you have to load the software again in between games... The only reason I bought it was because I needed something to save my games on, but I guarantee the first time I find a standard memory card, I'll be purchasing it, using the mega memory as my backup."
1,Dont buy this memory card,"This memory card even though it holds 15MG you have to put the disk in and boot it up before you can start any other game you want to play, wish i had read the reviews 1st."
1,no,"I should have never bought this product. The manual doesn't really tell you anything, beside that you must load the Memory Manager Disk every time you boost your ps2. It didn't even tell you how to format the damn thing. I have to sit there for about half an hour to figure it out. And once it got formatted, most of my games don't recognize the memory card. Because of my greed for more mb and cheaper than the Sony PS2 8mb memory card, I thought I have a good deal. NOT!! People, figure it out...a 16mb card is cheaper than most 8mb card out there. You don't have to be Einstein to figure that out."
1,this stinks!,"This card gives you alot of trouble.You have to always put in the mini disk in first. If you have game shark, you won't be able to use it because you can't put in the disk for the game shark in right after you put the mini disk in.And to top things off, it'll probably curupt on you.That's what happened to mine. I was playing gta3 and i had to do one last mission and guess what? My memory card curupted.I wa mad. Do your self a favor, don't buy this product."
1,a terrible product!,"this card has caused me so much grief... the reason i bought it cuz it seems to hold alot of saves and well other cards are hard to get your hands on, well when ever i put the disc in before loading my game it says please insert a ps2 disc!!!!!! it dosnt work... if i try 10-20 it works! its a horrible product.... dont buy it!!!!!"
2,ARG,"Man! this card is sweet except for one huge problem, you have to load in the minidisc EVERY time you power up or even restart your ps2.. and the minidisc program is slowwwww, also if that disc gets scratched... u have to buy a new card!...believe me! get the sony card.. it may be sold out in some places but its well worth it, just order it here"
1,Piece of ...,"I purchased one from Best Buy. I got it out of the case to find that I have to use the disc that comes with it to prime the card EVERY time I want to use it, otherwise the system won't recongnize that the card is even there. Second, couldn't format it to use it. I would suggest to spend your money elsewhere."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Just bought one at (...) the other day, looked like a killer deal. NOT!!! You have to load software everytime you use the card, doesn't say it on the box, but it is written right on the card. Don't get burned like I did."
1,This product deserves 0 stars.,I find myself lucky that I was able to save 4 out of my five games with this card. I know people who havn't been able to save any of their games. It only works with a select few games. A BIG let down. You might as well buy several regular PS2 memory cards.
1,Do not Buy this memory card,Do not buy this Memory card because it is a stupid thrid party assery. It says it can hold 16MB of info because use can conpress the files. BUt the compressing is a pain. And to even use it on a game you have to put this special disk in. But when you put the disk in it shows you all of the files on the Memory card. Then the software is so stupid that you can't go to the game from it and have to restart. Then agin you have to put the disk in to use the memory card. DON'T BUY THIS MEMORY CARD. STAY WITH THE FIRST PARTY.
1,Do Not Buy These Memory Card,I bought it and you have to keep putting in a disk to save the game. You would have to turn the power off to do it to it is really really really really really really really BAD MEMORY CARD
1,THIS IS THE WORST THING YOU COULD EVER BUY!,"This memory card only works with CERTAIN games, which means it is not worth the money you spend. You might as well spend the extra 5 bucks on the real sony PS2 and not have extra memory because this card is not user friendly. DO NOT BUY THIS MEMORY CARD!"
1,16 MB memory Card,"2 words: This [stinks]. 1st reason: In order to save a game or load a game you first have to enter a weird disc, then you have to wait for it to load, then you have to watch a STUPID intro., flip the disc over, press start, select stuff, then you have to wait for the game to load. THEN, you have to select Load Game from the game's menu, then you can play. But, on some games it doesn't work, such as Medal Of Honor Frontline, it doesn't work with that game, and I'm sure there are PLENTY more games it doesn't work with. In layman's terms, this stinks :(:(:(."
1,"Do not buy this ""memory"" card","I was over 10 hours into Sons Of Liberty, I saved on this card.I came back later and was not able to retreive my save for this game. Or any game. I was very angry. I learned a lesson.Loading the ""memory"" manager gets old very quickly.Buy another memory card."
1,An extremely bad product,"I had thought about using this card as a backup to my main 8MB playstation memory card.So I copied a bunch of game saves from my sony memory card to this one using their memory manager. I then deleted the same files on the sony card (since they were now backed up) using their software. Big mistake.These files are now corrupt in the sony memory card, it is not possible to delete or remove them. Cannot reformat my sony card. This product just scrapped a perfectly working sony memory card. Calling up their tech support, they state that they do not provide support for sony memory cards (even if it was their software that screwed it up).Bad bad bad buy."
2,"great, but doesn't fit!!!","Memory card is fine, but it doesn't fit inside the game case (for storage when not being used) so it's bound to get lost. Can't these firms that make compatible stuff ensure that products fit in the little spots they are meant to go! (Okay, so it fits in the game itself -- most important...) But come on, mostly these are being used by kids -- at least in my house -- and kids lose stuff, especially when there isn't a specific spot to put it!"
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME","I SO TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS CARD BECAUSE IT'S EXCELLENT. YOU GET A BUNCH OF MEMORY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO WASTE IT. IF YOU MANY PS2 GAMES, I SUGGEST YOU GET THIS CARD BECAUSE IT SO TOALLY REEKS OF AWESOMENESS DUDE!"
1,Recalled piece of garbage,"My friend works at a toy store, and when I went there to buy a memory card for my PS2, he said not to buy the 16MB card. They were recalled because of so many complaints with the ""memory manager"" software. Do you really want to put in an extra disk before starting your games? Do you think it's wise to compress files that aregoing to be used over and over again? Of course not. This product is not licensed by Sony, and if you screw up your PS2, you're S.O.L., because Sony won't touch you with a ten foot pole."
1,"16MB Memory Card by InterAct Accessories, Inc.","This memory card is a complete waste of money. Just to use the card you have to insert this dumb disk, when you insert it the disk it shows all of your files. It may sound easy but it much more complicated."
1,waste of money,One reviewer wrote that if you just read the directions you'll be okay. But I read the directions many times and the memory card still wiped out previously saved games. After playing Grand Theft Auto 3 for four hours the memory card was no longer recognized by the system. In the four hours that I was playing it worked fine. I ordered this card because I thought I was getting more for my money(16mb) but all I got was aggravation and disappointment. I'm shipping mine back and looking for a real playstation 2 memory card.
2,A hard act to follow,"I purchased PS2 in Feb 02 not realizing how hard it would be to find a standard 8MB memory card. So out of desperation I bought this 16MB card since Sony apparently can't keep retailers stocked with the 8MB cards. The packaging is misleading and the card itself is hard to use and often I have to load it 3 or 4 times before it finally ""takes."" Once it's loaded it works great but everytime you have to turn off the console or reset the game you have to go through the process all over again. Furthermore, the instructions included with the 16MB memory are practically useless. I ended up having to go to [another website] and download real instructions. Such a hassle. I'm dying for the time when 8MB memory cards become available again so I can get rid of this piece of trash."
1,return to sender,"I just want to say that after reading most of the reviews of this memory card, I have decided to return this piece of junk. I'm just waiting for it to arrive so I can turn around and send it right back."
1,DO NOT BUY!! IT DOES NOT WORK!!,"I got one, none of my games would save to it, even after I put in the Memory Manager cd like it said to. All of my games say that there is ""No memory card present"". This product doesn't work and should be pulled from the market by InterAct. I can't believe they charge money for this."
3,There are ups and downs,"Well at first I thought it was a excellent buy, but if you are new to the playstation family, I suggest not buying it because it is kind of tricky. For instance what that guy said about the formatting, he's wrong. It only says the memory card is not formatted when you take the memory card out of the slot when it is loading or saving something. When you that it erases everything on your memory card. But otherwise, the card is very good, it works with nearly every game. But I did come over one problem that said it could not detect a memory card, that was when i tried to save in grand theft auto 3, but otherwise the memory card is a very good buy, and the loading it with the cd only takes about a minute maximum."
1,16M PS/2 memory card (InterAct),"Tried 2 of these units...neither worked. The PlayStation-2 console did not recognize the supplied CD with the""Memory Manager"" software. The GameShark web sitewas no help at all."
4,good memory card,"I have read about a lot of people disliking this memory card, but my husband loves it. It holds twice as much as the ps2 cards do, and it's cheaper. What's not to like. Aside from having to load the card everytime you put a new game in the machine or turn it on, it's not that bothersome. It's very easy to use, and it works great."
1,Good And The Bad,"I have read numerous things about how it doesnt work and does work. I've tried loading the dic and whatever else it sais and mine does not work so you can see my opinion. Atleast 5 of my friends also purcased this memory card and all cannot get theres to work either. The only reason i may suggest you prhase this is because it comes with a disc that has loads of options:1.) Zip(crush)files on a regular 8MB or any other memory card2.) Unzip(Un-Crush) files3.) Transfer data t another memor card4.) Copy the dataI find #4 very handy incase one of your friends wants your gae saved. Maybe if they cant get past one thing or something. I really should have givin it a 2 Star rating for the reat dic it comes with ,but it really makes me mad i cant get the card to work."
1,Do Not Buy Ever!,Do not ever buy this product.It is one of the worst things I have ever bought.I just got it about two weeks ago and it already stopped working!The PS2 just totally stopped recognizing that there was a memory card in the slot.It is a total waste of time and money.Take me seriously.Do not buy it.Be smart and go with the other card that is licenced by Sony.If you buy this product you are making a huge mistake.Also you have to load your games with a disc every time you play a different game.It gets really annoying because it also takes a while to load.I'll say it for the last time.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! P.S. I'm really older than 12 I just couldn't figure out how to make a review so I just did the kids one.
3,Not So Bad...,"This memory card is not so bad. How can you give it one star because you have to load the disc each time you boot up? I admit, I would rather not have to do this, but I cannot fathom giving it one star for that reason alone. It has worked fine with my games and I have not had any trouble with it yet. I am giving it 3 stars because it is a decent 3rd party memory card that worked for me. I took 2 stars off because of the disk loading, and it certainly isn't equal to the 4/5 stars of the Sony brand card. I bought it because they were sold out of the Sony brand, and I haven't had problems with InterAct accessories in the past. Five stars? No. One Star? Not quite. It is a good product."
1,Sucky,"It gave my PS2 a virus and it deleted all of my data on my other memory card. Don't get this, it'll result in disaster"
1,16MB Memory Card,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!I'm sure you have other things to buy. Sure, this has instructions, but can you figure them out? Nope. I was waiting so long to buy a PS2. Got one! I put in the card, and I put in my game... All went well until I had to save... No memory card? Oh no, big mistake. Now I'm driven mad trying to figure it out! Not working at all...AHH!!!I wouldn't have given this a star at all, but there was no blank stars..."
4,Just what I thought,"I was hesitant to buy this after all the poor reviews I read, but since it was the only memory available for PS2, I took a chance. I haven't had any problems at all with the Interact 16MB card. It comes with a mini CD that has to be loaded each time you start the PS2 with the Interact memory card in the memory slot and the instructions tell you to do this 3 times on the first page. There is even a sticker on the memory card telling you to do this. Maybe Interact did this after all the complaints, but it couldn't be more obvious. It's not as easy as just sticking the card in and going, but for 16MB of memory it's not bad at all. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars. Remember, if all else fails, read the directions!"
1,I'd give it a lower rating but it's not possible.,"This memory card, unlike its PS 1 counterpart, gets two thumbs down. My reason for giving it such a low rating is not because of the annoying feature of having to insert the ""Mega Memory Manager"" disc every single time you turn the console on/off or reset it but is because it is totally incompatible with certain games. I know at least one game (Final Fantasy X) that does _not_ support this card, although the console itself does recognize it. In summary, if you want to be assured that your card works with _every_ PS 2 game, I would recommend getting the Sony one. If, however, you like to be surprised when it comes to finding out whether your card will work on a certain game, be my guest and buy this one."
2,The 16MB Memory Card,"Yes, it dose hold 16MB of memory and is about the same price as an 8MB memeory card. But there is a very big down side to this product. Most of the games do not regester the memory card so you can't save them. Another down side is that you must download the Memory Card software to your system each time you restart or turn off your system."
1,Has not been tested by Sony,"Do not buy this item. I used this product and it screwed my system up completely. I called Sony about the problem thinking it was the system and I told them I had purchased this memory card and Sony told me that this product has not been tested by Sony and that any product that is sold for the PS2 and is not a Sony product that we should be aware that they have not been tested by Sony and could screw up the system. BUY SONY PRODUCTS FOR YOUR PS2, it's safer."
1,The worst there is!,"This is the worst memory card that i have ever owned for playstation 2. This memory card is a piece of junk, if you think that you can just put it in the memory card slot and save the game you are very wrong. In order to be able to save the game you need to load the memory card in with a special disk which takes around five minutes. If you are looking to buy a good memory card, you should think of buying one that is made by playstation 2 or buy one that has the playstation logo of approval on it."
4,works good,It is easy to use and it saves you money. Why pay 34.00 fot a 8mbwhen you can get a 16mb for the same price. Just read the directions
2,"If it sounds too good to be true, it is","Don't waste your time and money. Seems like a good deal; double the memory for only ... more than the price of a Sony memory card. Trust me, you will get tired of loading the memory card CD prior to playing your favorite Playstation games. This product sealed its fate with me, however, when it stopped functioning after only owning it for a month...the memory card lost its formatting and for unexplainable reasons can no longer be formatted. The accompanying CD is now the most expensive and smallest frisbee in my collection."
1,Total Waste of Money,"Dont waste your money on this memory card,I couldnt get it to load any of the games we saved on it,and YES I did follow the directions,and did every thing right.We ended up buying a different memory card.I wish I had read the reviews on it BEFORE I bought It!"
2,Unremarkable,"Unfortunately the samples for this CD were unavailable, so I was unable to screen it before I bought it. As a consequence I am still looking for the orchestral version of Handel's ""Sarabande"" (I have purchased this CD just for that). Can someone please, recommend a decent version of it. This one is pleasant but regrettably unremarkable. The same comment applies to all other offerings on this CD. Pachelbel's Canon lacks the punch, Albinoni's Adagio is scared of being truly lyrical, Rameau sounds flat and so on. Overall, this CD consists of inferior interpretations of remarkable Classics. It is listenable but unexceptional and I do not recommend it."
5,The best Funeral Oration CD!,"This is the best CD I've heard from Funeral Oration. If you like some of their songs then you'll love this CD. bottom line, no bull, buy this CD."
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Ax`n Thru the Season","Well I had to dig a little deep into my YULEtide Treasure Chest to play this again while pounding the keys, what a refreshing ride down that jingle jam hill. Electric guitar strongly strumming thru seasonal standards and a few original gems you had no idea you were missing. I believe wholeheartly these merry-metal-mirth-makers are forfilling their role toward finding the joy for one and all, as this cd is a testimonial with such orginality.~~Merrily Mix~~ 1# , 3# , 5$ , 7$ , 8#1\2 , 9$ , 10# ,and 11$ ~~Post Script: Granted rock songsmiths and rock industry mucky-mucks just don`t jump on that seasonal sleigh enough for my liking, but based on the sales of this disc alone ya`gotta figure their Scrooge`nish would change.***buyit*saveit*shareit*giveit*donateit to the local library***"
2,They're not the original compositions!,"I was very disappointed because I expected the stuff to be the original music, maybe remastered or ""digitally enhanced"", but it's not. The arrangements are good, I suppose, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I feel like it's deceiving to call this album a ""soundtrack"" when it's really just a bunch of remakes of the original material.If you just want the tunes, I won't dis-recommend it becuase most of the tracks sound more or less like the originals, but if you want the honest-to-goodness real stuff, look elsewhere."
1,Over priced?,"The #6 filters are becoming difficult to find but, you may buy them at Market Basket for $1.29, or Melitta's website for $1.99."
4,Really cute book!,"If I were going to rate this book only on looks, I would have given it a 5 because it's so pretty. This is a very cute, short and basic little book. It has great color, great art and it's a very light read. This would be great for someone who is just getting into Feng Shui. Overall I think this is a great book if; 1) You want a nice ""happy"" feel-good book to inspire you 2) You want a cute, trendy coffee table book 3) You have kids or teenagers who want to learn about Feng Shui 4) You want a short book to take on a plane 5) You are apartment hunting and want a quick referance guide...However, if you are looking to give your life an overhaul or you are wanting to learn advanced Feng Shui this might NOT be the book for you. I think this is a great gift, a great coffee table book and basically a ""fun"" book that I'll keep in my collection."
3,good for beginers,"is not what I espected but is good for beginers, easy to understand, I will recomend this book to my feng shui people."
2,Save your money..,"I bought the Kindle version for my home-design-enthusiast wife.She wasn't impressed, particularly by the illustrations.I didn't like the weird font/typeface that shows up on the Kindle.The whole thing strikes me as being a bit on the artsy-fartsy side of reality, frankly.Not worth $9, sorry. Can I get a refund/credit?"
1,type face is horrible!!!!,The type space is so bad on the kindle version I am not sure I can even finish reading this book. Kind of counterproductive to feng shui isn't it. :(
3,Home Design with Feng Shui A-Z,"Okay book, good info, but her other book Western Guide to Feng Shui is definitely better."
5,Cure Math Phobia: Learn Easily and Naturally,"This is a marvelous book. It deals with serious mathematics, but it is a self-teaching tool. It begins with the most basic of basics to make sure that the reader is ready for more and then continues into more advanced topics. It is so well constructed that all the reader needs is an understanding of the most basic logic. When you finish this book, you will know more than you did and you will be proud of yourself. If you use it as I did to prepare for a college math class, you'll have an ""A"" in your back pocket."
5,Thoroughly Brilliant,"In this one of many brilliant books by Ellul, he exposes the folly of a purely collective, societal approach, such as that offered by communism, or capitalism. Instead, through a study of various Biblical references in the Old and New Testament, puts the responsibilty on the individual. The new covenant of Jesus is compared to the Old Testament pattern of wealth as a sign of blessing. He examines the teaching of Jesus on God and Mammon. Contemporary models of stewardship are exposed as inadequate. Further, he clearly shows the underlying power money has over a person, despite any feelings of control we may think we have. The teachings of Jesus about giving and trusting provide the path to freedom. We disarm the power of money by giving. Only by God's grace and transforming love are we able to overcome this subtle and insidious power. Highly recommended, especially at a time in our history when many have lost faith in the market."
3,An Amy Grant Worship Experience,"This is more like a worship album than anything else. Amy Grant, the superstar of Christian music back in her golden days playing her guitar on stage. The album reflects Amy at this time of her life. The songs reflects her questions, faith and the way she wants to share her beliefs in a loving God.This CD is simple, but it conveys something rich and mysterious: A young woman's faith and hope in a future with her God."
4,Amy Grant rocks in concert!,"I think Amy Grant really wanted to express her passion for not only wanting to spread Christian music, but also her passion for spreading it with an electric guitar. That's what IN CONCERT VOLUME TWO is about. There are 4 original songs (""I'm Gonna Fly"", ""You Gave Me Love"", ""Fill Me With Your Love"", and ""Nobody Loves Me Like You"") that Amy did wonderful on. The rest of te songs, Amy Grant made signature rock songs out of. I think that this is a must have for Amy Grant's UNGUARDED and HEART IN MOTION fans."
5,Fits like a glove,This Dallas Cowboys steering wheel cover is true to size and fits like a glove and is very comfortable and stylish.
3,too much responsibilty,"for my son who is 6 it was alittle too much responsibilty!!He was too stressed over the color of the light .He kept on checking wheather it was alive or drowning every two munutes.AT the end we had to throw it away!!!!!!!!!!!! I told him that it was only a toy with batteries ,( he got the idea espcially that he is big on robots and science )but for him it felt like a real alive alien toy.Two weeks after trash day he would still talk about what could've happened to it in the trash .If he was 9 or 10 he would've like'd it better and thought it is cool.But my son was too emotional about the whole hatching and surviving thing.Honestly I liked to keep it i thought it was pretty cool"
5,Averi rocks!,Try to see them live if you can. They are great. I never thought I would say this but that saxaphone is incredible.
4,It's a great soundtrack,"If you like the andre 3000 production, you'll love this soundtrack. one of the down sides i think are that some of the songs are short. other than that. I really like it."
3,Fun album,"As a 23 year old bass player I felt silly picking this up, but the truth is that this album is worth it. I think this album shows off alot of the things that are popular in more adult oriented funk well by having a very carefree and offbeat set of music and lyrics. Despite the kiddy voices this album doesnt feel that off compared to more standard funk in my playlist."
2,Tony and Susan,"Our book club read this and was sharply divided. If you love horror, I guess you'd like this. It was not my genre. Also, it was difficult to find copies,"
1,Tony & Susan,"I had read a review of this book from Book Page (I believe), and since it was being re-issued, they made it sound like a ""must read"". I have read hundreds of mysteries, psychological thrillers, etc. In my opinion, this was, by far, the worst book I have read! Mystery or otherwise."
4,i love it,"everybody noticed it ""nice shoes"", i little bit uncomfortable at first but you get use to it. If you go out don't stand up for long time take a break . i love it !!!"
5,Great book!!!,"If you are interested in learning how to get a healthy mouth and a WHITE SMILE, than don't look any further! This is the book that will teach you everything you need to know, and I mean everything, from finding the right dentist, to how you should floss and brush, and finally my favorite - aesthetic evaluation.It's informative and thorough, it's resourceful and it's fun.Highly recommended!"
5,Smile Beauty's!,Wonderful book that covers all aspects of oral health care. Everyone should own this book.
5,Excellent book for beginning spinners and knitters,"This is a lovely book that belongs in every spinners collections. The photographs are wonderful and the information is presented in a very clear and concise manner.This book covers the basic information needed to spin a coherent yarn to specifications & produce the sweater shown. The knitting directions are well written. When dyeing was needed to produce a given effect in the article, the directions were also clear and concise.I bought this book right after I learned to spin. I have made several articles from it, and have used it as source material for some original designs. Now that I teach others to spin, I use this book as a reference material for my students."
3,Only get this if you are a huge fan of the band,"Ok I AM a huge fan of Evanescence, and i still felt let down with this buy. ""Bring Me to Life"" is great, but don't be fooled by the Bliss Mix. All the Bliss Mix is, is ""Bring Me To Life"" without Paul McCoy's lines, that is it.As for the other songs, while its great to get them, since they were cut from the album, they are not that good. The slow ""Missing"", however, is better than the fast, hard ""Farther Away"". The 3rd song cut from the album, ""Breathe No More"", is much better; sadly it is not on this single.If you want to have Bing Me to Life without buying the album, or want to have the 2 extra songs, go for it. Other than that, be wary about buying this single."
5,Delightful,"I don't normally listen to top 40 rock music. I am a hip hop, reggae, R&B fan. When I heard 'Bring Me to Life', I could not get enough of it. I wish they had an extended mix version which runs at least 15 minutes. Not a day goes by without a need to hear it. It has become my daily music fix and I haven't tired of it yet. It gives me goose bumps when I listen to it. The rush I feel when I hear it really gets my blood pumping. When I work out I can go farther when it plays. Something about it is just addictive. The lyrics have great depth and feeling. It is a wonderful piece of art.I prefer the version with the added vocals of Paul McCoy. The Bliss Mix is potent but it's like a good stew with an ingredient missing. Farther away is also very good to listen to. I'm glad I bought this CD so I can hear it whenever I need to."
1,Worst song of all time!,This is one of the worst bands of all time! Listen to Manowar for real music!
4,Without Paul McCoy! Hurray!,"This is a great CD for one reason, Bring me to Life (Bliss Mix). This version of the song is the way it should be, without the vocal stylings (or lack thereof) of Paul McCoy from 12 Stones. I realize a lot people out there probably enjoy the radio/album version, and I have no problem with that.The video for the song is also featured on this disc. It's a little over dramatic, but I still enjoy watching it."
4,Farther Away,Bring Me to Life is a good single and this CD comes with a nice remix. But the real reason to get the CD is to get the b-side Farther Away which was a bonus track on Fallen only in Japan and you can also own a copy of it live on Anywhere But Home. It's an excellent rock song and Amy's vocals are amazing.
2,lukewarm on this one,"Some of the songs have a catchy melody, however they can easily get old. Her voice carries the same tones through most of the songs making them sound very similiar. It's hard to listen to the cd all the way through because it does get a little boring."
4,Don't need to be an original fan to enjoy,"Okay look, this original fan crap is just a bit bothersome. This cd rocks, and you don't have to be a fan that has followed the band since the late 90's to know that. The tracks Farther Away and Missing are absolutely awesome and (in all honesty) should not have been left off of the Fallen release. And as for the versions of BMtL, the Bliss mix is by far the better of the two...but that's my opinion because I don't like 12 Stones.Honestly though, if you enjoy the Fallen cd alot...and have downloaded many of Evanescence's earlier tracks (from ""Origin"" or the '99 release ""EP"") as I have, you are sure to like this cd. Yes it is only four songs...but tracks 2 through 4 are worth it...especially if you love this band. (Finally a band who knows how to make good music...and they don't sound like Creed or Green Day or Pearl Jam!!!)."
2,Insufferable,"This is one of the worst of Mrs. Thirkell's books for snobbishness. What I find even more annoying than her attitude to the rising middle classes and foreigners, is her contempt for educated women. She saves the worst of her barbs and nastiest portrayals for them. Female physicians (Dr Morgan) or scholars (Mrs. Tebbins) are always pathetic creatures. An admirable female scholar (Miss Sparling) is self-abasing and submissive to ""real"" (male) scholars. Thirkell's father was an Oxford don and he obviously thought Oxford was no place for Angela. She must have absorbed his contempt for the women who did brave his scorn to break those barriers. I suspect a good part of her attitude is actually jealousy for opportunities she was denied. She scorns the ""cocoa parties"" she was never able to share."
5,Video Game,"I purchased this Disney/Pizar Monsters, Inc. game for my grandson. He liked the game, and it was a good price."
3,Cute but hard to breathe,"The mask is very cute on, for older kids possible five and up, the mask is big and extremely hard to breathe out of. It gets warm in there. Good for about two minutes of play."
2,"Could be better, but TZ is and will always be a cult-tv show","I wonder and I keep wondering why there is no order in this collection. It could have been season by season, or according to the episode numbers, to the air dates or even conceptual (horror, time travel, extraterrestrials, etc). In this DVD, you can find a little bit of everything (different seasons and subjects). First we have an episode from season one (""Long Live Walter Jameson), which is -by far- the best episode found here: a history expert is actually an immortal being. From the third season we have ""Dead Man's Shoes"", gangster's shoes actually, with a terrible curse. Both of these shows were written by Charles Beaumont. After that we get two episodes from the fifth and final season, ""You Drive"", a highly probable inspiration for Stephen King's Christine or ""The Car"", and ""The Long Morrow"" -the only story here written by creator Rod Serling- with a space sci-fi plot... The extra features in the DVD are cool"
4,A Pin to See the Peepshow,"The novel may soften the representation of the murder in the Thompson-Bywaters case it was based on but otherwise closely tracks Young's Notable British Trials account. Young too thought Mrs. Thompson innocent. What the novel most brilliantly does is show how its protagonist is executed not for murder but adultery and not so much even for adultery as for being a middle class adulteress, upper class adultery being quietly fashionable, and lower class unnoticed. Tennyson shows her character as a human sacrifice to the hypocrisies of the class system."
5,Gunna be great!,"This game is going to be out of this world. All new moves, new courts, better graphics, and new players from MJ to Larry Bird to even NELLY!"
4,AWESOME!!!,"Ive played lots of basketball games but they were boring and had no exitement to it, but NBA STREET VOL 2 was of the hook. I recromend that you buy this game instead of renting."
4,"entertaining ""hard science"" fiction","Robert Forward is a scientist who writes fiction. He thinks and describes in terms of science problems and then writes a fictional story around it. The story is of the first manned expedition to Saturn. The science behind the mission is well substantiated and interesting, (but most likely only to geeks like myself.) In Forward's world, Saturn is inhabited with creatures that ""swim"" in it's dense atmosphere. We are introduced to the intelligent, apex predator life forms that have an interesting first contact with the humans. The characters are interesting, but the writing is a little Tom Clancy-ish. Characters have fairly basic personalties and their interactions are a little stale.The yarn is a good one and the predicament, of possibly being stranded is very interesting."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this book very much. It started slow, but got quicker paced as it went a long. I found it funny at times. This is my first book by Robert Forward, and I would read some of his other books as time permits...Enjoy....Mike"
4,It was pretty good. Worth reading.,I thought the author did a very good job at making a realistic story. There were some parts that I wish he wouldn't go into so much detail about the science. But the aliens were very well done characters. I'd recommend this book.
4,Another good book by Forward,Can life exist in a gas giant's atmosphere? Intelligent life isa hard thing to find anywhere in the universe and this book gives us a whale of a story about a sea so far away. A mission of modern science has been to find other intelligent life and communicate with it. Very few unique kinds of intelligent life have been invented by hard science fiction writers. Robert Forward is one of the best at it.
3,Old-Fashioned SF,"Spoilers!!This is typical Forward: wooden characters whose interactions with each other are totally unbelievable, endless detail of beautiful, real near-future science, silly excuse-for-a-plot, and gorgeous, staggering vistas of real otherworlds and their realistic, amazingly creative inhabitants. The ruus, huge gasbags flying in the atmosphere of Saturn, are far more interesting than the humans who contact them, but Forward always does this. The scenes are giant, brilliantly colored, animated Chesley Bonestell movies: the ruus diving to hunt; the humans ""climbing down Saturn's Rings"" with the aid of the (real) Hoytether, a kind of super rope which Forward marketed; the funeral of an aged rukh whose flockmates sing as she falls endlessly to the lethal gas layers below; the final battle with an alien monster myth-made-real. If you value character and plot, take your business elswhere. For science and the sheer pleasure of the view, read this!"
3,Don't Read This Book. . .,". . .for depth of character development! Like many of Forward's novels, there is a definite weakness in that department. HOWEVER, if you like ""hard"" science fiction -- sci fi which grasps the best that current scientific understanding has to offer, you will thoroughly enjoy this engaging book.Forward writes of a mission to Saturn's atmosphere in order to build a fuel factory from the (almost) limitless supply of helium contained there. In the process, the crew discovers life -- life supremely suited to its environment.4.5 for the science, 3 for the plot, 1.5 for the shallow characters. Overall, a 3 -- and a good read."
5,Excellent Book,"I loved this book. I could hardly put it down. Being a science-oriented person, I had no problem with all the science. It did not seem dry or boring at all. The speculation as to the nature of intelligent life in a non-Terran ecosystem was fascinating. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Robert Forward always rights good hard science fiction, but.","I always enjoy the books of Mr. Forward, both the fiction and the science articles. I recommend this book to people who like hard science fiction.However, looking on page 214,we read his character's description of hiragana ""...A single Japanese hiragana character can be either a word or a long phrase..."" There is more, and this is simply wrong. Each hiragana is a simple character, and a student could easily learn the entire hiragana set in one day. Each hiragana character represents a simple sound and nothing else. Examples are ka, ki, ku, ke, ko. Mr. Forward is confusing hiragana with kanji! Other than that, a good job."
2,Not the best Forward's book,"Robert L. Forward's writing had always been mediocre at best. However, most of his books compensate for this by sheer wonder of the described worlds (like the surface of a neutron star in ""Dragon Egg"").This book - not so much. The setting is pretty dull compared to his other books and expository dialogs are sometimes downright painful to read."
4,Rather Morose,the pictures are cute but the overall feeling in the book just didn't keep my students attention and they seemed to just be disappointed in each ending that the frog got a lollipop
5,brilliant visual artist/genius educator,Wendy Ewald's American Alphabets illustrates a collaborative work between children and visual artist; the book is a wonderful adventure into fine art photography and education; the result is a photography project (series) that puts both artist/educator and children/students way ahead of the learning curve;
2,It's not much!,"I am very disappointed in this biography. I will admit, at this point, I'm only half way through but wondering if I even want to bother finishing it. To me it's just a glorified timeline. The bones are there but no meat. Miss Francis may have left detailed diaries but the details don't seem to have made their way into this book. What I have read so far makes me think two things . . . either the author is lacking talent or Kay Francis was pretty boring. Maybe it's one or the other or maybe it's both. This book gives no clues to the answer to that question. I can tell you one thing, I won't waste money on any more books by this author."
3,Not for little kids...,"It's very bulky and contains hundreds of parts to assemble. Certainly not for little kids, if I remind you. One serious problem with GP-02 is that it has very loose shoulder-to-torso joint, so the arms will fall of constantly. If you have some skill you might want to modify the shoulder joint area."
2,"""who told you that you could sing?""","This Cd gets a review of 2 simply because of the time it must have taken to record it in some low end studio somwhere. It has very few moments of clarity but overall the vocalist breaks into an unnatural vocal tone lamenting about trite life experiences. It sounds as if she is reading from a 12 year-old's diary. There is a mother load of contrived vocal style throughout the whole vocal performance and an overall lack of real talent.The music is dull and unspired. The production is a 2 out of 10. The arrangements are basic.suggestions: dump the singer, get a drummer, and write some normal songs that people may enjoy listening to more than half way through."
5,Jodie Manross - A must for any music lover,"An incredible mix of vocals and rhythms that leaves you wanting more. Far superior to the run-of-the-mill voacl, guitar, bass, drums that pollutes the airwaves these days. Music like this is a rare find. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, and then drive to Knoxville and hear them for yourself"
3,Pretty Good Book,I can say that I have read better books but this book was good it was pretty funny I enjoyed the story line but I think that too much emphasis was put on why Jake couldnt be with her I think the self pity role was played a bit too much.....I enjoyed Shaylas character I enjoyed watching her grow up and become her own woman and most definitely finding love in the most unlikely of all palces....... all in all I enjoyed the book I will definitely make it my business to read more of her novels..................
5,Review from Richie,Better than expected costomer service. I received this item in time and very happy with it. I had been eager to receive this book since a while.
5,My kids will own this one.,"I decided to get the best reviewed canner and this was it. Quality construction and easy to use. Not too heavy and not too big. You can get the large quart jars in, no problem and stack lots of little ones. Fits on the stove and under the counter. Aluminum heats up fast. It's done all the tomatoes for this year in a snap and I'm considering making some zucchini pickles from the recipe book that came with it. I don't envision ever needing anything bigger unless I go professional! I'm thinking of cooking in it soon to see what the time savings are. A pot roast would be a good test. At up to 15 lbs. of pressure, I think it'll cook pretty quickly."
5,What a great canner,"This canner is excellent. It is very heavy, and you don't have to worry about the rubber seal because there isn't one. I bought one this year because my okra and tomatoes just wouldn't stop producing. But I have also used it as a boiling water canner for making fig jam, peach jam, pear jam...ect... I've also made pickles both sweet and dill. Comes with very clear instructions and you can begin to use it the day it is delivered - as long as you have the rest of the canning equip. Now the only problem is where to hide it so that my darling spouse won't use it every day !"
5,AWESOME product,"Love, Love, Love the All American 15.5 quart liquid capacity Model 915 heavy cast aluminum pressure canner/cooker.Have just started using it and it works perfectly. No problems with the seal after lubricating as directed with olive oil.I spent a long time researching pressure canner/cookers and chose the All American because of its long history of positive feedback and consistent performance. I chose the 915 because it gave me the highest capacity for the least weight. I am definitely happy with my purchase and would recommend this product over and over again.I look forward to many years of use."
5,Canning dream,"I LOVE this. No fears and worries while I can. It is too big to be used as a traditional pressure cooker, for instance, for cooking meat. This is great for canning anything and everything."
5,Perfect,"This is my second canning season with this canner and I absolutely love it for its solid, reliable performance. Yes it's heavy and stays hot a long time--but it's a pressure canner and that's how it works. I wish all my kitchen appliances were as well-made. This will be passed down to my children!"
1,Can't Use on Ceramic Cooktops,"After reading all the reviews on this canner and how wonderful it seemed to be, imagine my surprise when I opened the Amazon box to see that the very first thing printed on the top of the canner box read:IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE ON GLASS, CERAMIC, OR FLAT TOP RANGESThis would have been nice to know before I bought it. I will be sending this one back, unopened."
5,Love that it is made in USA!,"I have never owned or operated a pressure cooker. I am proud to say that I have now canned many pints of tomatoes that I had frozen, waiting to be canned. I plan on trying to cook with it too, not just use it as a canner."
5,Do not cook tomato sauce in aluminum cookware.,"I saw one reviewer who claimed to use this pressure cooker for her tomato sauce, but I am posting to let you know that it is not a good idea to cook tomato sauce in an aluminum pot or pan - the acid will react with the aluminum creating an unpleasant taste and it may even pose some health risks."
5,Love my pressure canner,I do a lot of home canning. Now a whole new world has opened up because I am making kettles of soup and safely preserving them. Love this item.
5,We love this canner.,My wife loves this canner. She has a hard time getting the lid on but she is not scared of it like the last one. It is very well built and looks like it should last for ever!
3,Can't process quart jars!,"I almost bought this size but I bought the 21-1/2 quart one instead because, at the time, it was only $20 more. I'm glad I bought the bigger one because you cannot process quart jars using the hot water bath method because the 15-1/2 size is not deep enough. I plan to can tomatoes so I would have had to return the 15-1/2 cooker.I received the 21-1/2 cooker and was overwhelmed by the immense size and heft of it but I'm glad I ordered the bigger one. I just found out by reading the manual that the 15-1/2 size won't process quart jars. Bummer.Just thought I'd post this here in case anyone was interested in buying this to process quart jars of tomatoes!(A few days ago, the price on the 15-1/2 was $179 and now it's $239! The 21-1/2 size is $199!)"
5,American Made Top Quality,We can tuna and salmon and this product was recommended to us by friends. The precision of manufacture is so good that it doesn't require any seals. We just rub a little olive oil where the lid touches the pot and it seals perfectly and also comes apart without sticking. Although this product is more expensive than others it is worth every penny. We also bought a Presto canner with a seal. It is a good product but nothing like this one. I am sure this will be handed down to our grandchildren as it will last that long and the folks at All-American make sure of that with a solid warranty.
5,Cindy McCament,"Works great! I have a smooth top glass stove and had a little bit of concern as to how well this would work on it. I have no problem getting it to reach the pressure I need and maintaining it. The lid is a little tricky to get on, but once you get used to it, it works great. Make sure to put vaseline around the rim of the lid as suggested in the manual. It really makes a difference."
2,I Don't Like It,"This thing is heavy and it is hard to wash. The lid is quite fussy, despite being well-lubricated with Vaseline. After several uses, the lid forms a vacuum each time and is very difficult to remove. It is also not as convenient to clamp down the lid compared to the modern lids that turn into place and use a gasket.I gave this item two stars because it did perform as it should, but the issues with the lid make this thing very inconvient for me to use. It is also quicker to use my Presto canner rather than lubricating the seal on this one.I will not be keeping this canner and I will use my Presto 16-quart instead."
3,"Disappointed-holds 8 pint jars, advertises 10. Why?","All American Canner/Cooker Mdl #915 15.5 quart liquid capacity:I was so anxious to get this canner. This weekend (Sept. 29, 2012)I prepared 10 pints of sirloin for canning only to find out the canner ONLY FITS 8 Ball pint jars. Not 10 as advertised. Overall I like the canner but not the capacity."
2,Disappointment,"I had eagerly anticipated this disc, but was greatly disappointed in the quality of the sound and the animation. Each of the segments was animated in a different style, and some of them worked OK but some did not work well at all. The Rigoletto, for example, was entertaining and imaginative, but the Magic Flute was disorganized and the story line was almost missing. The Carmen was probably the best of the bunch and the Turandot was probably overall the worst--bad, in fact.The sound was disappointing because the balance was off-the orchestra sometimes overpowered the singers. The singers were generally quite good. The singers were sometimes hard to understand, and the disc would have been better with subtitles, even though all the singing was in English. I love good animation and opera but this just wasn't it."
2,weak collection,"the poems in this collection range from merely mediocre to bad. the major theme is being indian and the wrongs done. but if you are familiar with alexie's worth than that won't surprise you. and his sister's death by fire makes an appearance in several poems. the problem is alexie never says anything new in this book. you could pick any five poems at random and that's all you need. the other poems say the same thing. there is one bright spot, the first section of his poem ""Inside Dachau"", but it completely falls apart after that first section. i hope that one day alexie will select his best 10 poems and the best of his short stories and put out a selected poems and prose, that way instead of having so many mediocre books, maybe we can get one book that is really good."
3,"Good Quality, Just Large","I'm about average size and this bag was GIANT on me. My wife couldn't stop laughing as I tried to adjust it while attempting to make myself appear larger. No luck, so I returned it. I did really like the features and build quality. It was a very nice quality bag if you are looking for a LARGE messenger style bag."
1,I didn't recieve this book,"I'm very disappointed this site because I ordered this book and I waited very long time.My class already was opened and I had many difficultied to take class without book, but I believed this site so I waited and waited. Today I received E mail for loss of my ordered book and they said no residual book. Wow! Amazing!!! I waited over 20days..."
3,Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Theory and Practice,"The edition is not that I wanted, you sold me the 1st edition, but I wanted 3rd edition"
4,one of melanie c's greatest albums.,i really liked this cd it reminded me of the 90's pop musicmelnie c really gave it her best in this cd. im real excitedthat the spice girls are gonna get back together july 2006.it has a some rock music in it too if anybody out there likesrock music.
3,Absolute rubbish! :-(,"I decided to buy this because Mel C was my favourite out of the Spice Girls, but it's a huge disappointment.Here It Comes Again is quite cool and powerful, On The Horizon is a feel-good sunny tune and Positively Somewhere is ok but she could have done a lot better."
2,"Sorry folks, but it's disappointing!","When Spice Girls was over, I was really disappointed, not because I was a big fan of them, but I'm really fond of Mel C's voice. Then she made a duet with Bryan Adams and I started hoping that she wouldn't stop singing. And when I first listened to Northern Star my breath was taken away by it. When I first listened to Reason it really bored me, I missed that musical background which Northern Star had. It's too usual and poppish 4 me.Sorry"
2,Northern Star was better,Northern star was a much better CD. This isn't quite as good. The music doesn't really get to you.
3,"Grow on me, damn it","This is a bit disappointing, but 'Here it comes again' was ok -bland but.i hope it grows on me."
3,A little disappointed...I hate to report....,I was sooooo eager for this new release from the talented Spice Girl...Melanie C. NORTHERN STAR was one of my favorite albums of 2000....Where that set mixed many styles and sounds..this one puts Melanie in an almost middle-of-the-road blandness. A few standout songs (Here It Comes Again...Reason...Melt....Yeh Yeh Yeh) get lost in a lot of blah blah blah. Sure...Sporty sounds incredible...always love her voice....she just isn't saying anything!I am still hoping it will all grow on me....
2,Yawn,"You would never know that MelC was known as ""talented Spice"" after listening to this yawner. Mel sings ""from the book"" instead of from the heart. Whereas the other Spicers can't hit the high notes as well, you can at least warm up to their imperfections. NORTHERN STAR (Mel's first album) was great. Her voice was produced well enough and the ""screechiness"" was toned down. But REASON sounds like a demo version of the real thing. A stripped down, technical, rocklite bore. Get Northern Star instead. Better yet get EMMA's new one FREE ME or Victoria's new single LET YOUR HEAD GO."
3,unsure,"Personally, i love mel c. i think she is a brillant performer and she has an excellent voice. Northern Star was a truly fantastic album. every track was a winner.this album on the other hand, i am unsure about. it has a couple of great tracks, such as yeh yeh yeh, let's love and reason but many of the others don't have much going for them. Hopefully this will not put Mel C off making another album because i look forward to some new material from her.so all in all, if you like Mel c, buy this album. if not, borrow it off someone, have a listen and then decide"
3,3.5,"I was a little disappointed with this album. It's more pop driven than 'Northern Star'. Though there are some jems on this album ('Here It Comes Again'), I don't think this is the best choice for Melanie. I'd recommend 'Northern Star' instead."
2,Mediocre,"Melanie C is my favorite singer, but ""Reason"" just didn't make the cut with me. I had the expectations that this cd would follow some of the steps Northern Star had taken. Northern Star incorporated just about every genre while ""Reason"" is basically pop ballads. I think Reason fails to make any songs that stand out except ""Yeh Yeh Yeh"" while the others are mediocre. One major gripe is that the copy protection does not let you listen to the cd on pc and my cdrom is my primary cd player."
2,Not her best,"When i brought this album, i was think i would like it as it was mel c & as a fan.I it was very poor, non of the songs i really liked apart from On The Horizon.Dont buy this album if you want the same as the first album. cause it is no way anything like it."
5,"Fun, sweet, girlie, and touching!","Definately a girls, girl book. Never really took even time to think about Teri Hatcher before one way or the other, but the cover caught my eye in teh book store.I really, really enjoyed this book. As others have said not super deep, in a super deep way, but actually is in it's simplicity and honesty. I laughed a lot and cried a little even surprised at how honest she really was with her daughter in moments - - in a very good way!- - don't want to ruin the book.Highly recommend reading. It inspired you to live you're day honestly and with hope, and, for those gosh darn bleak days, to not beat yourself up, but know you'll get through it and just look for the lessons.You feel like you're talking to one of your very best girlfriends.Thanks for writing it Teri!!enjoy~"
3,"Um, it's okay...","Going into this, I certainly wasn't expecting much. I realize Teri Hatcher is an actor, not a prize winning author, so I didn't expect this to be a fabulous novel or anything. And I got basically what I expected.I admired some of her ideas on mindful parenting (she really sounds like a wonderful mother who's doing a great job raising her daughter on her own), but at the same time, there's some preachiness about making choices in the form of 'do as I say, not as I do' going on. The repetion of stories and analogies got old pretty fast (we get it, Teri, you're terribly insecure, naturally thin, dateless, a has-been, and you feel guilty throwing away the burnt toast) and it seemed kind of disorganized and stretched for content. She's a real person, and wants everyone to know it. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it. I definitely don't need to read it again."
1,Book is only good for firewood,"I must admit that I have never been a fan of Teri Hatcher so perhaps my review will come across as biased. I think there is a lot wrong with Teri Hatcher and I have always felt that when I see her on tv or give interviews. I think she is very superficial and looks terrible these days. The reason she doesnt attract men is she is too into her own looks and not into being a real person. She has no confidence, no belief in anything real except whining about being 40 years old (which is not old in my book). I think she is a terrible role model and I wouldnt date her even if I was a hollywood star or someone paid me a lot of money. She is a very insecure person and only seems to have ""Desperate Wives"" to claim her fame when really its nothing but a cheesy soap opera."
1,Waste Of Time! Another WOE IS ME Celebrity book,"This Book was a Complete Waste of Time! Teri hatcher Comes off like a head case in this book. most of the book she talks about her Insecurities, her years as a ""Has Been"", she whines about how she cannot get a man, Honey LOOK IN THE MIRROR! She cant get a man because she is a head case, this woman has so many issues and is way too High Maitenance! I thought the worst part of the book is when she spends a whole chapter on Losing The Emmy Award! This woman goes on and on about Losing the emmy and The worst part is that she REFUSES to actually name the winner in the book(which was her Costar the much better actress FELICITY HUFFMAN)! Teri states in the book that she ""congratulated the winner"" but you can tell that she was sore at losing the Emmy because she Actually did not name Felicity! I have two words for you Teri GROW UP!"
1,Painful to read even an excerpt,"I clicked on a link to this book from my homepage. The link included an excerpt of this book and it was so painful to read, I could hardly get through it and it was only a couple of pages long. I can't even imagine reading the entire book. The example that was given in the excerpt did a very poor job of making her point. I had no idea where she was going with her example. And her analogy of burnt toast is simplistic, silly and laborious to read. Just when I thought it was over, she would go on about it for another couple of paragraphs. The message is old, boring and I've heard it over and over and over and over and over again. The writing is poor and sleep inducing. A great read, and perhaps a somewhat related topic is To Hell With That by Caitlin Flanagan. Excellent writing. Though she isn't a TV star."
2,Confusing and irritable,"I read a reveiw that said this book is a ""stream of consiousness."" Because of these ramblings it was hard to read and not very interesting. It is also a pity party that is boring and not one I want to be a part of in any way. I also read a review that said she needs to grow up. I agree!!!! Terri you are not in Junior HIgh anymore. It is time to act like a woman and not a teenager. I think you would get more dates that way. No man wants to put up with a whiner. I love your acting but I think you should leave writing to the professionals."
2,Not for younger readers,"I'm in my early twenties and did not find anything in this book to be relevant to my life. I feel that it is intended for a more mature audience who may be balancing kids, husbands and jobs.To the younger fans of Teri Hatcher, wait a few years on this one."
2,Over cooked Toast,"Teri Hatcher has been an actress with more than twenty years experience in the entertainment business. One would hope that when she wrote her biography Burned Toast (Three hrs, three cds, abridgement, Hyperion audiobooks /Time Warner Audio), it would be more exciting and entertaining . . . it isn't.The audio book seems more like pop psych class mixed with a slice of celebrity hype. She tries to compare life to the burnt toasts that made her life. Ms Hatcher does not do a TELL ALL bio, I bet she has stories to tell . . . Maybe her next book.This audio production isn't even fully narrated by Ms Hatcher, it narrated by Deanna Hurst. Ms Hurst's narrative abilities surpass the abridged text she is reading. Ms Hatcher does bookend (introduction and afterwards)on the audio piece.Does the words ""Miss this one"" help you make up your mind?Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,HONESTLY a great book...I was skeptical but THIS IS GOOD!,"Thank you Teri Hatcher for exposing yourself as truly HUMAN! Your intimate book was a BREATHE of fresh air into the REALITY of both CELEBRITY & WOMANHOOD alike!---Celebrities are just regular people with everyday struggles....especially of the most common type! I thought this book was REAL & INSIGHTFUL! It is courageous and true. (*note-especially coming from a CELEBRITY. Teri IS beautiful & sucessful yet still craves what we all do on basic levels. This means to me that REGARDLESS of what we accumulate, it is our own self-worth that we ""crown"" ourselves with in riches. (And to the rest of you....I am not her friend, I do watch Desperate Housewives....I was not paid to leave this review...I rarely ever leave reviews and am an avid book reader......) THIS IS A WONDERFUL Book!"
2,Teri Hatcher should not have written a diary for the world to read....,"Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist."
1,Would you like a little cheese with that whine?,"Boo-hoo. My life is so tough. I am a single mother. I am a big star.Get over it! We all have to graduate from Self-Pity Junior High some time. But if this is Ms. Hatcher's term paper, I'm afraid she'll be repeating the grade again."
4,Pleasantly surprised...,"I've never really followed Teri Hatcher very closely and wasn't sure whether I would like this book. I purchased it out of curiosity. What I found was pleasantly suprising - not only was it a fun read, there were many similarities between my own single, working, mom lifestyle that had me in hysterics and sometimes even in tears."
4,Fluffy Fun,"A quick, fun read with nice humor. Teri seems to be just another gal who happens to work on the set of one of the most popular TV shows of her time, bouncing between staying grounded and fulfilling her obligations in Hollywood. I admire her balancing act between acting and parenting. I enjoyed reading about her charming relationship with her daughter. Yes, Jerry, Teri is real, and as a real person, she is spectacular!"
2,"I'm so happy to be me, Teri Hatcher","Teri seems to be quite full of herself. She is very self-centered, and know it all. This book could have been done in half the pages."
2,ok - not great,found the book to be slow - she wrote in a stream of consiousness. Not a lot of order or organization to her thoughts.
2,Not as good as I expected..,I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it.I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..
2,Just too repetitive,This book just said the same thing over and over. She constantly refers to her age and her bad choices in life. While reading this I also felt like someone was preaching to me about how I should be like she strives to be. She beats herself up alot in this book. It was a hard one for me to get through simply because of its repetitive nature.She does have a few good point to make but only a few.
4,Really Good Read and Thought Provoking,"It's been a long time since I read something late into the night, as I'm usually too tired with a 2 year old and a 3 month old baby to spend much time reading at all. This book was very inspiring, though, and made me think about a lot of things. It's also written in a very entertaining, casual style and keeps you hooked. It is obvious that the book comes straight from her heart. I hope that women who are inspired by the on-screen Teri will read this and be moved to care for the neglected parts of their own lives. Many blessings, Teri!"
1,The worst book I have ever read,"Don't waste your time with this - it is without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. I was so disappointed in reading this since I am a Teri Hatcher fan. All Teri does in this book is feel sorry for herself, at great length, repeating basically the same story over and over. And, she wonders why she doesn't have a lot of dates??? Time to grow up, Teri, you are 40, not 14!"
3,It was all eh...,"Teri Hatcher can write a book, I give her that. It kept me reading and wanting to know more. But the whole time I was reading it, I couldn't help but wonder if she was LOOKING for our approval. I loved that she can be down to earth and that she has worked for what she has...but I couldn't help wonder if she was wanting her fans to be like ""Yes Teri, you are this, that and the other""."
2,Seems that Toshiba quality has gone down lately!,"I've owned several Toshiba televisions over the years, and the one striking feature they all had was solid build quality, and excellent reception and picture quality. Not so with this model. Even with an amplified VHF/UHF antenna, and living in a major metro area, reception is subpar on many channels. The picture jumps a lot (doesn't sync), and is subject to image ghosting. This is a shame because the DVD player, and DVD picture quality is excellent. So, this unit is indeed a 'mixed blessing'. Look elsewhere for a quality 13"" TV/DVD combo unit.UPDATE: 12/24/06; As of yesterday, I discovered that this DVD player will NOT play several DVD's I fed it! I had purchased some educational DVD's for my toddler, and out of the 6, it only plays 4. It turns out that this DVD player is in fact a P.O.S. Stay away from this subpar TV!"
3,Not Ideal for bigger bags...,I bought this hook to use at work. Unfortunatly I have a big work purse and this clip is not ideal for it. I would only recommend if you want to use it with a small or medium purse.
4,Panasonic!,Panasonic is good! Phone works great. Easy to use with head phone or just put on speaker. Just push orange button and set it down.
5,Beautiful writing,"I love the mixture of fiction and non-fiction and poetry in this book. All of it is sexy, interesting, fresh and new. Highly recommended, and a great gift for a love to get them talking about what they like."
2,From Porn to Poetry to Yawning,"This anthology is not particularly erotic, literate, clever, amusing, or original. If you think it is, you need to read better erotica. There's a boring lecture about abstinence, a fishy story about a cat and canned tuna, a geography lesson that features a woman reciting the capitals of countries, and a simply uninspired recipe for a human strawberry shortcake. The quality of the book is poor, too; after a single reading the binding came apart. Maybe my hands got too excited from reading it? Nah!"
5,Mortal Storm dvd,"This movie is a great movie with mystery, action etc.It keeps the viewer involved and entertained. Greatmovie with a ""clean"" script."
5,"Warning, history can repeat itself",This story of the rise of Nazi Germany power should never be forgotten and should be known to every soul that this insane inhumanity to man should never happen again.
4,The mortal storm,I purchased this item as a gift for christmas. It arrived fairly quick and as described. Not as quick as other items I ordered the same day but still on time for christmas. Thank you for a smooth transaction.
4,"Not having this ""bites"".","Some people don't like the fact that this is so 1994. That's exactly why I like it. Of course with every movie soundtrack, it helps if you liked the movie too, which I did, I mean come on, Winona! But anyway. I can actually say that in some way i like every song here. You got the more well known bands like ""The Knack"", ""U2"", and ""Lenny Kravitz"", all with good songs. But I like the stuff from ""Dinosaur Jr."", ""Crowded House"", and ""Juliana Hatfield"" just as much. Now that I think about it, I believe ""Stay"" was the big song off this. Even the ""Ethan Hawke"" song is decent. Basically this is just a great thing to put on whenever you're in your grunge/slacker mood."
3,Kind of a goofy mix of songs,I really only bought the cd for the songs tempted and stay the other songs im not really interested in my sharona is not bad some of the other songs just seem like filler.
4,"""Stay"" is one of my All-Time-Favorites.","Saw the movie. I liked the movie itself, and the songs. So I bought this album, and it became one of my favorites since. ""Stay"" is the one I love the most, but the rest are all OK too.(Though it's made up with SO various songs.) If you liked the movie, I'm sure you'll love the album too."
2,I never saw this movie,"But the soundtrack definitely bites. I used to have this album, and I thought that I was going to like this album. Was I ever wrong. I guess that's the price you pay for being open-minded to music. The Knack do a good reworking of the classic ""My Sharona"", and the Indians do a good job with ""Bed Of Roses"", U2 donates ""All I Want Is You"", and World Party's song is rather good, but the best ones on here are: The Poises ""Going Going Gone"", and Ethan Hawke's ""I'm Nuthin"". The rest of this album bites big time. I may watch this movie someday maybe rent it on Netflix, or something, but I will not own this album again."
3,Lyrics are very philosophical but production is kinda bland.,"Lewis Parker is a very very good British MC who reminds me of William Blake in his lyrics and stylings and even topics too... However, the production is rather bland and Stonehenge like. I enjoy the piano samples and the various string samples and they remind of RZA. However, the lack of funk is rather evident and it seems more ambient in my own ears.Song of the Desert and 101 Pianos are the album's highlights. I did like the fact that the album was short and without any filler material. Hopefully he can get a better producer. On the other hand, I did enjoy some scratching on the CD at least..."
2,Not too Hot,"I bought a few of these and end up have to buy the metal ones, which were real better and firm. These are plastic and might break later. For mobile gear I would not used them"
4,back to his roots,"Charlie Mars is one of a kind. Everyone who has the chance to see him live falls in love with his music. His old stuff is worth checking out even if his self titled CD doesn't do it for you. His earlier stuff is more soulful, less pop-ish. Enjoy the unique sound and his sexy raspy voice. I love ""black dress"" and ""broken arrow""..."
4,"This album is great, but where is the new one? Like a Bird, Like a Plane","I was first introduced to this album through Oxford American magazine's yearly music compilation. I loved Silver Buttons enough to buy the album. It remains one of my favorite cds to this day.Charlie Mars just put out another album that demonstrates a great deal of growth and is a fun album to listen to...Like a Bird, Like a Plane is worth buying. Funky rhythms and a great southern voice, makes you feel good listening to it. Special attention to the title track and Listen to the Darkside.Get it off his website if you can't find it here[...]"
5,Loved this bra,"I am a heavy top and was looking for a bra that had underwire for support, seamless and non padded. I have worn this bra on occasions and loved the smooth contour and perfect support for D-cup size. Also, this bra is durable. It has lasted me for over two years!"
2,The ladies wouldn't have it...,"Let's face it, ladies, if we're well-endowed, then no strapless will save us! I love Wacoal because it's the only product line with high-quality size 32D (big - and now post-pregnancy - boobs on a small frame) wireless bras. I ended up having to retun this because like EVERY strapless I've tried, it just didn't hold 'em up. Sigh..."
1,Amazon messed up my order.,"I wish I could give a better review of this item, but unfortunately, Amazon interpreted a black, 32DD, as a nude 36 DD! So needless to say it's on it's way back home. I was able to find an alternative-- also Wacoal, black, and in my size! Did I mention I paid over 60 percent LESS than this bra? It's not the same style, but the Wacaol quality and fit is there. You would be surprised at the deals you will find when you're willing to step outside of your house and do some bargain hunting."
1,Never received,I never received this item. I got two notices from UPS and was never able to pick it up before it left the post office. I'm not even sure if the money was refunded into my account yet.Thanks for any help on where this item might be. I would like to send it back at this point because I already ordered and received another one.
3,"Simple, light weight, but little 'support'","I did like this bra for the situation i ordered it for. This past June i needed a light weight strapless bra for a cute top (also purchased on amazon) that had spaghetti straps.It worked well in the outdoor setting at the zoo, it was quite warm and the light weight lacey bra helped a lot. but i have to say i spent a great deal of time pulling it back UP. i even went an inch smaller in the bust to give me some more GRIP! and i still had to pull it up. it also didn't have much form around the top of the 'cup' so it felt like it was squashing my breasts..lol not flattering to say the least.over all though it was comfy and aside from those issues it worked out fine for a day at the zoo. i wouldn't however wear it under a nice dress or blouse. i'd need more support."
2,won't stay in my cup holder,I have several different version of this type of holder and swear by all of them but this one I don't like. First of all it will not stay in my cup holder so I would not trust it to keep my tea from spilling all over my car. Second it is very hard to figure out how to adjust it and the instructions are not good.
1,Terrible in every way,"This product is absolutely horrible for two reasons. The quality is extremely cheap, making adjustments nearly impossible. The ""key"" and ""tension lifter"" used to adjust the part that fits into your car's cup holder is made of very thin plastic. It breaks easily, but it is so hard to move you practically have to break it to operate it. The second reason is design. The large, wide semi-circular section covers up anything beside the holder you're trying to create! So if you have two existing cup holders in your car, and you're trying to use this one to improve upon the size of one of them (the whole point of this thing, right?), then you have to sacrifice the other cup holder to do it. Ridiculous. Glad I didn't spend much - I got less than I paid for if that's even possible."
2,"Great if it works in your car, beware compact owners!","I tried to make this work, and have had the ""too small"" cupholder issue in a 2000 mitsubishi mirage, 1995 ford bronco, and now, a 2004 subaru impreza. this WILL work for some vehicles. many reviewers had a lot of trouble adjusting it, and, while i did eventually break the item, i would probably still try one in a different vehicle if i had to do the whole thing over (the subaru has a tiny cupholder and this, with a drink in it, could have blocked my arm when shifting gears, or the emergency brake (it was close). for the record, i plan to just use smaller travel mugs whenever possible, keep one in the car for big soda/water bottles that don't fit, and maybe putting a flat cup holder in the center console armrest for a LARGE thermos mug or fast food soda. sounds like a hassle, but you'll throw out more amazon cupholder doodads that don't fit than travel mugs. a travel mug that doesn't fit in your car is still a cup you can drink out of."
2,Tips Over,"I have a 2004 Ford Mustang. It has one small cupholder and one large cupholder. I purchased this item to fit down into the large cupholder and hold reg. cups to stop them from tipping over. Now... The whole thing just tips over because of how it sits in the holder and I, without a doubt get, drink spilt on me now! Don't recommend for this type of vehicle. Guess I will have to find something else, maybe at the dealership."
2,"Poor instructions, difficult to use this product","This product is difficult to adjust, and what few instructions come with it are pretty much worthless. I bought 2 of these to use with oversized cups. By the time I was able to get one of them to adjust, the clip which held it to the size chosen was broken, so it is now worthless. Now knowing how to adjust it, the other one seemed to adjust fine, but the mechanism that holds the cup in place is not strong enough to hold the size cups of that size full of a drink; within a couple weeks, it was no longer the same size I'd adjusted it to (had spread apart about 1/2 inch farther. Although it does continue to hold my oversized cup, it wouldn't if there was a sudden stop or change of direction and probably isn't worth the amount charged for it. Maybe two of them should be priced at what is charged for each."
3,Retro Cupholder,It is a pity that it does not fit in my 1995 volvo 960. But I think it is fine once it works for other vehicles.
1,Will not stay in holder,I have tried everything but these will not stay in holder on Kia Sorento. I bought two of them and threw them away.
3,Used to like,"Used to like these back in the day, but now they are pretty crappie and an eye sore with no color choices for matching interiors."
3,Could have been better,"I liked the idea of this & have had one before. I was disappointed in this one because it broke within about 2 weeks, at the bottom, where it's supposed to adjust to fit in the cup holder. I still may try another one."
5,This Hopkins Cupholder was exactly what I wanted,"This cupholder was exactly what I wanted, It is easy to adjust the cup holder and the part that fits in the cup holder in the car.Hopkins RETRO-CHA Retro Cupholder (Charcoal)I am thinking about buying another one to keep as a spare in case something happens to the one I bought. I have a large cup and it is hard to find a cup holder that will fit it."
4,"takes up some room, but works well","My wife uses it in her car and she is very happy with it. It does take up a significant amount of space, but in our Equinox it can be positioned so that we can still use both cup holders in the center console."
2,Cover doesn't match Content,"This book has a cover that is very misleading. A picture of a sexy woman posing with sexy legs leads reader to believe that this is some sort of erotica that they can enjoy reading in the dark. Unfortunately it is not (in a good way). The book is more like a documentary about sexual research and varius interviews and commentaries published in newspapers about sexualy active people. Some segments are very good such as ""Call Girl"" about the daily life of a prostitute from her perspective. Another one that was higly insightful was the research performed at truck stops and the sex-drug comunities that follows it. However I had to use a paper to hide the cover of this book just to read it outside the house just because it misleads people to think that this is a ""naughty"" book which it isn't."
5,Exceptional!,"I found this material extremely helpful andinformative, after reviewing the tapes I discovereda new found confidence and was able to tap intothe tools with this tremendous information. Knowledgeis power, and Voice Versatility gives you just that.I highly recommend this product for people in allwalks of life. A plus to Kathe Perez and Lynn Skinnerfor their combined efforts and their fantastic series! ..."
5,Real Reformer!,"This book has a short, but sweet little biography about a man of God when there were very few true men of God. He was willing to be homeless and put his life on the line everyday in order to stand up for the truth of God's Word. When men like Zwingli and Luther are celebrated for their part in the ""reformation"", men like Menno Simons took the reformation all the way! Other ""reformers"" sold the Bible and God short when they came out of the Roman Catholic Church. Menno did not! After the short biography, there is a section that gives brief statements about what he believed doctrinally. He is right on in almost everything and exposes the lies of the other ""reformers"". Take a read of this book in order to read about a REAL Reformer!"
1,Fortunately I did not buy this book,Fortunately I got this book from the Library .I was interested to see what other people thought of this book so I went to this site to see the reviews it received .I was amazed to see the posotive feedback from other readers only to realize that some of the reviews had the same gramatical errors that the book contained .I only wonder .
1,"Who wrote this book, Casson or Jones?","Compare the this book with ""The History Of The Telephone"" BY HERBERT N. CASSON Published: 1910There are entire sentences and in some cases paragraphs that appear in both books. It looks as though Mr. Jones is taking credit for someone else's writing.It makes me question the rest of the book."
4,Good Business Book,I wish this book had more info on the network. But the business and management information is unsurpassed. Good book in this respect.
5,Details and Emotions,"This book is very detail oriented, nothing is left out. This is the complete sales giude from which to build a complete system of personal and sales success."
4,Very good substance but not concetrated enough,I am a person very new to sales. I have just bought this book and after reading it I can say that the ground rules it gives for succesful salepeople are extremely interesting and I am grateful it will help me start my career on the right foot. However this book is needlesly long and repetitive throughout. Most parragraphs could have been cut down to half their lenght and could have added to the books impact. Otherwise this is a great read.
4,Essential Knowledge,"Although most of this book deals with the seller's state of mind and attitudes, it is still essential to learn and master.Anyhow, what makes or breaks a sale is your own personality, but as the customer perceives it. If you're not a great believer in your self and the product you're selling, most prospects will feel it on you and think it is because of the product itself not fulfilling its promise...Yes, this book could have been titled differently, but there are still some strategies in there, directly for closing the sale, that you cannot afford to miss.Tracey is known for his high quality writing and simple direct way of teaching. Even the common sense ideas are explained thoroughly and from angles you might not have thought of."
5,Detailed how-to information that can be usefully applied,"Brian Tracy details the psychological aspects and the nitty gritty of the three steps to effective consultative selling: (1) build rapport and credibility, (2) diagnose problem, and (3) prescribe / present solution.Brian describes several critical success factors in selling. The critical success factors in any profession is the minimal set of factors that need to be accomplished well to be successful in that profession. For effective selling, mastering the following critical success factors is required: (1) prospecting (2) getting appointments (3) qualifying (4) problem identification and clarification (5) presenting (6) answering objections (7) closing (8) follow-through and delivery and (9) resales and referrals.Brian discusses unique aspects related to selling to large accounts. You will undoubtedly become a more effective salesperson by practicing the techniques discussed here."
5,Advanced overview indeed !,"I would say that Advanced Selling Strategies book describes all the 'non Technical' issues that are needed to sell, a selling monk can only write such staff.A five stars reading!"
5,Top book on selling,"I've only read this book once. I'm more of a copywriterthan a one-on-one salesperson, though I have to do that tosell my services often enough.The thing that stands out to me is this unoriginal thought:Great salespeople get that way not by making huge breathroughsin one area but by making small, incremental improvementsin dozens of areas.Excellent book. It tries to cover nearly every aspect of whatmakes a great salesperson and does an admirable job. It endsup being long though and for that reason may be a betterreference book than a straight-through reader."
4,Great Selling Tool,I recommend this book to any person who is interested on reaching difficult customers and closing important deals. Brian Tracy brings with simplicity and profound knowledge a path which facilitates the prospecting stage and brings more confidence to the closing stage.
5,PRAGMATIC & POWERFUL! DESERVES A HIGHER RATING THAN A 10!,"I have been an astute student of Brian Tracy since 1989. My introduction to Mr Tracy was ""The Pyschology of Selling"" and ""The Phoenix Seminar-Pyschology of Achievement"" . His programs have made a powerful impact on my life, in my sales career and in personal relationships as well. I was able to rebuild myself from the inside out and completely turn my sales career around. I went from 64th out of 66 in my sales group to 3rd out of 75 in one month! Brian's books are as easy to read as his tapes are easy to listen to. If you want to jump start your sales career--this is the bok to buy!"
1,THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME,"I have been reading this thing and the first half of the book is about your thinking and all this talk about self-motivation and positive thinking. I suppose its appropriate for beginners, but not very impressive information for top performers. The title is misleading as I did not read anything on advanced selling from marketing, prospecting, qualifying, presenting, overcoming objectives and closing. I would love to see some more advanced thinking in these sales training books like developing a sales strategy and sales plan. Does anyone know a top notch book that does this?"
4,A lot cramed into a small book.,"This Little Wisdom Book is small, only about 6 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches, and 57 pages. BUT - it has many reproductions of medievel illustrations, quotes from Chaucer, Hermes Trismegistrus, Albertus Magnus. Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas are mentioned in relation to Alchemy amoung others. Think of it as a one hour class in Medievel Alchemy."
4,I want to find a thousand atars when I arrive...,"...when I arrive at the North Rim which is where I want to spend our honeymoon now, after reading Madison's book. We're getting married in Las Vegas, Nevada in September and we were going to honeymoon at the south rim... not anymore! The dance of a thousand stars will shine brightly once again when we open the door to room 306 and cross over into THE NORTH RIM!! Loved this book. Can't wait to read Latrobe's Crossing now."
4,A very good album,"A relaxing, moody and intelligent album. It took me a couple of listens to really appreciate it, but it's an album of subtle beauty and Margot's voice is soothing. I was first made aware of the Cowboy Junkies from hearing ""Anniversary Song"" which was being played on country radio. But I wouldn't really call them a country band, although I suppose there are some elements of country in some of their stuff, hence their name. But it doesn't really matter...I'm not really one for labelling artists as being of a certain musical category. This is good music and deserves to be heard. The booklet includes all lyrics."
5,"i think once you hear this album ""your mind will change and your heart will lose it's pain""",after 16 years this is still one of my favorite albums of all time. Margo's voice gets in your heart and you can feel her emotions as she sings. if you buy any albums by the cowboy junkies this should be the one.
4,Subtle Charms,"Another fine album from the Cowboy Junkies. ""Pale Sun"" is more brooding moody music created by Michael Timmins and sung by his sister Margo. Highlights include ""Anniversary Song"", ""Crescent Moon"", and the haunting ""Floorboard Blues"". I really find it hard to describe just exactly what this band does, but they do it so well it tends to seep into your being."
4,A Wealth of Information,"This book is full of great information about the central nervous system and it's function; how it all works together and how it can affect us when it goes awry. Dr. Goldstein is a genius in his research and approaches to Chronic Fatigue which is such a hard disease to lhave accurately diagnosed from today's medical community. It is equally hard to live with as I am a chronic fatigue sufferer. My only knock on this book is that it does not go into more depth on Dr. Goldstein's treatment plans and hopefully one of his books, or a new one he has soon to be released will. Especially since he has suddenly retired due to illness. I can only hope another doctor will decide to take the challenge and follow in his footsteps and continue the wonderful research and treatments which he has started that has helped many sufferers of this disease; and this knowledge and information will not be lost."
5,Listen and you can apreciate...........,"Donald Fagen has done it again. If you just sit back and listen, perhaps once or twice, you will be able to fully understand the true appreciation of Donalds most recent work, ""Morph the Cat."". This is a continuium of this man's outstanding ability to combine his poetic expressions with an outstanding melodic composition. I think you must understand Donalds musical talents before passing judgement on this work. I have been a very fond admirer and devout fan of this man since the beginning and this fits in perfectly with his growth and development as far as his professional musical talent. Give a sincre listen, appreciate what it is all about, know that this is a really outstanding piece of Donald's great contribution to the musical world..........."
3,Almost but not quite,"Having been into Steely Dan since 1976, I really want to like everything these guys do. Well, I still like most of what they do, but this is my second-least favourite of all the Dan albums and the 3 Fagen albums. Nightfly, I will always love. Kamakiriad, I like one or two tracks. Morph has taken me a couple of years to get into. Now I REALLY like H Gang (in fact I think it is a great tune) and What I Do. I am trying to like some of the others but it ain't happening. Sigh. Whatever Donald I will still love your music forever."
5,QUINTESSENTIAL FAGEN,"Membership in dan fandom requires an appreciation for the catalyst of Steely Dan...Donald Fagen. Yeah, I agree with the others who say Morph is not The Nightfly. But nothing ever will be. Nightfly is the gold standard and still sounds as cool today as it did in '82, and it always will. But this is Fagen, it is New York. And Morph has got something that keeps you hanging around for more, much like Nightfly does. Great Pagoda of Funn is vintage raw Donald Fagen and reminds us why we have loved him for 34 great years...and counting. If you haven't seen Steely Dan or Fagen live, do so if you have any chance. It will be the greatest musical experience you ever experience. He dedicates this effort to his mother's memory. She'd be mighty proud."
5,Sophisticated,"The third installment of the trilogy that began with Night Fly, followed by Kamikiriad, and now the ending with Morph The Cat. Brilliant fusion arrangements and melodies. Some with a funky beat. Donald Fagen is one the history's greatest composers and songwriters. Listen to all three chronologically and you'll get what he's singing about!"
3,Morphine the Cat,"Given the Dan's hero worship of junkies,didn't anybody get the not so subtle reference of the album?Chasing the dragon and deriving ones name from a book written by a hard core junkie may suggest that maybe these boys got a genuine habit?"
4,Good Music,"There are several musicians I turn to when I want to listen to music that makes me feel good and Donald Fagan is one of them. While this is not my favorite album from him, it is still better than a whole lot of other releases from so many other musicians. Donadl Fagan is consistently good."
3,"(Yes, that's the sound of faint praise you're hearing)","My first reaction on listening to the entire CD was: A dozen years' wait for this?The good news is that the album is technically perfect and it's better than 90% of the garbage you'll hear on Clearchannel or Entercomm radio stations.The bad news is that the album is only 52 minutes long and doesn't offer anything Fagen hasn't already done better on Kamakiriad or Two Against Nature. While I wasn't expecting anything like the days of Skunk Baxter Steely Dan or even The Nightfly, I was expecting to hear some new ideas after more than a dozen years."
2,Someone please wake up Donal Fagin,"When did Donal Fagin become a lounge act? From the fury and brilliance of Kid Charlemagne, to the wit and poetry of Nightfly to THIS? You can count on the following; lazy bass line, some muffled horns, laid back guitar, etc. etc. etc.....ZZZZZZZZZZ. This was a phone in of an album, no difference among the songs and a major disappointment. Fagin has been heading in this direction for a while but this is a major drop in quality. If he's not interested in exploring musically anymore he should just quit and find a beach. I kept measuring these songs against Any Major Dude, or the entire album of Aja for Gods sake, and wanted to pinch myself. Yes, I think it's that bad."
1,Steely Dan fan disappointed again,"I don't understand it. I LOVE Steely Dan. Own the box set. Play it a lot. Had all the albums and GOLD and PRETZEL LOGIC on CD before I bought the box. Like just about everything on the box set (which of course has the FULL Dan catalogue up through GAUCHO on it)So how come the only Fagen solo project I even like is THE NIGHTFLY?I think the answer is simple: hooks. Steely Dan's got `em but Fagen usually skips them.The one decent tune here, ""Security Joan"", is a come-on to a woman who makes her living vetting possible airport troublemakers.I can't live by music alone, Don...you gotta find a way to pair it with catchier words next time out."
2,Dreary,"Every song has the same pacing. The melodies are non-existent. If you're looking for Aja or Gaucho-styled songs, they're not here. There's really nothing to recommend this disk. He sleep-walked through the whole thing."
2,Not what I hoped,"I'm a major Dan and Donald fan, and this effort left me disappointed. The songs are slow, not very melodic and, well, kind of boring.Maybe I need a few more listens, but after the first two, I'm not all that excited for a third."
3,Still Undecided.,"The jury is still out with this one for me. The recording sounds like any other Steely Dan/Fagen CD - great. But I think the songs are a little tooooo long. Maybe that is where I find the negativity for me. I put a few songs on my IPOD, but will wait until I add the rest. Gave it 3 stars because I liked his previous solo work & I have the Steely Dan box set."
2,Wish I could give it more stars,Great production and grooves but somehow most of this album is kind of boring coffee table music. One or two tracks stand out but I'm still waiting for it to grow on me. I must admit that before this was released I had bought 'Aja' on CD to replace vinyl and it is stuck in my head. Nothing will compare to 'Aja' or 'Scam' so maybe it's just me . I still wouldn't say it was a 5 star CD.
2,pretty average&Standard,"I have all of Steely Dan's Albums,but I do miss the Gary Katz Era Production along with the Joe Sample Runs on Keyboards. there have been two New Steely Dan Albums since the 2000 Era&they are both Hit&Miss to me. this Album follows that&that ain't a good thing. yes the Playing is top notch&Production is crisp,but there is a element of surrpise lacking.this Album wasn't worth a 13 year wait. first of all nothing that Steely Dan as a Band or Solo is touching ""Nightfly"" From 82 since. that Album is one of the most underrated.""Kamakiriad"" had some cool moments on it,but it worked better because there hadn't been a new release in quite some time. this Album I got closer to a 2.5 overall. there isn't that One song that knocks me out. good runs&Polished Production,but not that one song that would make me want to listen to this album over&over. still Donald Fagen is a talented cat with Smooth Chops&Understands a Groove."
3,Not His Best Effort,"I was glad to see Donald Fagen back with a new CD, especially so soon after the wonderful ""Everything Must Go"" from Steely Dan..After hearing the first couple songs on ""Morph"", I became disappointed..The first 4 tracks are excellent, Morph the Cat"", ""H Gang"" ""Brite Nightgown"",and ""What I Do"" are wonderfully delicious, but the CD seems to go downhill from there...After these gems, the rest of the songs sounds the same and listener begins to lose interest.......Not one of his best efforts and certainly not as good as ""The Nightfly"", but the new CD is worth getting just the first 4 songs alone!"
4,His best solo LP is either this one or The Nightfly,"First of all - this has got to be the best sounding cd of recent times, I mean as an engineering effort - it sounds amazingly crisp and warm at the same time. An example: the track ""What I Do"".Pretty much every track is a winner, although I do prefer the more straightforward Rhythm&Blues-esque; tracks like ""H Gang"" or ""What I Do"" to the twisting and turning, and quite complicated tunes like ""Great Pagoda Of Funn"".Of course the Steely Dan aspect is in there, perhaps he lets his soloists stretch out a bit more than on a SD album.The Dan man didn't fail this Fagen fan."
3,Nice sounding DVD-A & decent music...,"I think this album needs a fair amount of listening to appreciate (I HOPE!). It's better with each playing so I guess I'm still undecided but generally liking the music. DEFINITELY not as accessible as Kamakiriad.Audio quality is great. Fagen's 'dry' vocals are very crisp. The surround mix is not overdone and is very clear. If you like Donald Fagen and surround music, this disk is worth getting."
2,Very Disappointed,"Let me make this short, I have played this CD twice, and am very disappointed. The songs sound like they were churned out by rote, and not written with a concept theme. There is no spirit to this collection of songs; It lacks the wit, innovation and thoughtful mood creation of Steely Dan's early releases like ""The Royal Scam"", ""Pretzel Logic"" ""Gaucho"", even the rough hewed and uneven ""Can't Buy a Thrill"" Fagan's 'The NightFly"" is far superior. The musicanship of ""Morph"" is first rate, but does not carry this album. Finally, the title is dumb. Donald Fagan needs to regroup."
3,Not as good as Kamakiriad or The Nightfly,"In my opinion, Morph the Cat isn't quite on par with Donald Fagen's previous work. Sure, the songs deal with serious, mature topics, but musically, most of them I didn't find especially catchy or memorable. For the Fagen completist only.~~LJB"
3,If you must,"I'm a huge Steely Dan/Donald Fagen fan, so I would've bought this anyway. A bit of a disappointment, and not his best. Oh, well. Everyone won't be Kamakirad."
3,A Just OK Album,"After two great solo albums with The Nightfly and Kamakiriad, I was somewhat disappointed with this effort. Don't get me wrong, it is an OK CD. But that's all, just OK. And for Donald Fagen, that's disappointing. Nothing really stood out. There was absolutely no WOW factor to be found anywhere. And there were a couple of throw aways including the title track.Maybe it'll grow on me. But with his previous two solo albums, both grabbed me at first listen. This one did not.But I still love Donald Fagen's work, solo and with Walter Becker."
3,Not bad but not Steely Dan,"Quickly...Musically speaking, better than Kamakiriad, not as good as The Nightfly and worlds apart from Aja & Gaucho. From a sound quality perspective, waaay to ""ripe""... filled with bloated bass lines, only the musially naive will find this enjoyable. Boom box fans unite... thumping dead ahead!With its mechanical and fabricated sound, AUDIOPHILES BEWARE !! It ain't Aja or Gaucho or The Nightfly or Kamakiriad!! Is this acceptable in 2006?"
3,Not good enough for Donald Fagen,"As a big fan of Fagen's, I feel reluctant to dismiss ""Morph the Cat"" as a shiny new package of battered old stuff, but there is no denying that this album contains less than enough fresh ideas. Besides, Fagen's new material often shows a lack of energy that not even his superb craftsmanship can compensate for.The most interesting track is perhaps ""Mary Shut the Garden Door"" (a little too long, though).The best-written one is, I think, ""The Night Belongs to Mona"".""Brite Nitegown"" and ""Security Joan"" are enjoyable songs, not unworthy of Fagen's reputation.""H Gang"" is supposed to be the big one, but I don't like it at all.The rest is insignificant."
5,"BEST ALBUM SINCE ""AJA"". * * * * *","Chill out on the ""techno-talk"" guys, this album is SMOKING HOT!The guitar firm of Herrington, McCracken, & Krantz have brought back the creative diversity of Steely Dan albums like ""Katy Lied"" and particularly ""Royal Scam"". THE GREAT PAGODA OF FUNN is a Fagen classic like I.G.Y. WHAT I DO sounds like it's from the PRETZEL LOGIC album.....AWESOME! The best song on the album, in my opinion, and as a life-long DANAHOLIC, my opinion really matters, is THE NIGHT BELONGS TO MONA, which could easily be inserted on to Side One of the AJA album right before DEACON BLUES. Beautiful song. DAN-FANS....BUY THIS NOW.....PLAY IT LOUD.....SIP NIRSCHWASSER FROM A SHELL......SPARK A FAT ONE.....ENJOY."
3,"Mediocre, at best","Sadly, although it's clear Fagen was trying to create another ""Aja"" here, it's just another of his post-Steely Dan efforts that lacks creativity or freshness. A disappointment to this faithful Fagen/Steely Dan fan."
1,Bad!,"I saw Fagen in Chicago on 3/18/06. He started 20 minutes late, ended early, and only gave an encore of one song. He did mostly stuff from this album, and didn't seem to want to ""entertain"" that night. ""Bright Nightgown"" is the most tedious song he's ever done, with his backup singers repeating that title for a good 5 minutes or so. In light of his ""performance"" if you want to call it that, there's no way I'd buy this album."
5,We're getting there......,"Firstly, let us rejoice in the news that ""Morph the Cat"" is a LOT better than ""Everything Must Go"", which was Steely Dan's car boot sale nadir, and the semi-vapid Kamakiriad.Sadly, its no ""Nightfly"", although we're getting there - there are songs in this collection which stand up well in comparison to Fagen's finest hour. Indeed, if you found ""The great pagoda of funn"" tucked away between ""The Nightfly"" and ""The Goodbye Look"", it would not seem out of place.It sounds to me as if Fagen has started to tap into what Steely did best, the jazz voicings, dazzling harmonies, magnificent ensemble playing, the harmonic side, rather than just rhythms and grooves.Will he ever make an album as good as ""The Nightfly"" again?On the strength of this collection, the answer is ""quite possibly""..."
4,S-m-o-o-o-o-t-h and satisfying without being boring.,"I was reluctant to buy Fagen's new album ""Morph The Cat"" after Steely Dan's last album, ""Everything Must Go"", the ONLY Steely Dan album I did not like from their entire career. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the cd had all of the musical qualities of his last two solo albums with traces of Steely Dan's ""Aja"", ""Gaucho"" and ""Two Against Nature"" mixed in. The result is great music; smooth, jazzy and really quite catchy.I wouldn't be completely honest, though, if I didn't tell you that, in my opinion, MORPH THE CAT is a stupid title."
4,still better than 90% of new music,I am a life long fan of steely dan/ Donald Fagen. I dont know of any other artist with such broad appeal. He and Walter Becker are true musical craftsman. I wish all recording artists cared about their work as much as they do.Morph the cat is growing on me the more I listen to it. It has awesome arrangements and some very catchey melodies. Mr Fagen does his usual trick of writing somewhat criptic lyrics but you gotta love it.There are only 8 tracks on the disc (not counting the reprise) and some seem to go on a little long but that is better than 12 shorter songs with lots of filler.I would definitly recomend this disc to anyone who is fimiliar with sd/df. You wont be disappointed (unless you want to be)
2,Disappointing,"I own nearly every Steely Dan album and, of course, own Fagen's two other disks. I find Morph nearly unlistenable: too much dull, boring, droning one and on (esp the first title cut). I hear a touch of that old magic sparkle here and there. If you somehow own Morph but don't own The Nightfly, then please get that album and hear what I mean in comparison."
2,Something of a disappointment...,"...to someone who genuinely enjoyed Fagen's clever work on ""The Nightfly"" and ""Kamakiriad""; no new ground is broken here, and I'll likely end up giving it away."
1,NOT AGE APPROIATED FOR A 7 YEAR OLD,"We got this for my grand-daughters 7th birthday last night.We are returning today. The music sounds robotic, the dance steps are to fast and to difficult.Her 16 year old sister who has mastered DDR hated it and it was hard for her. But most of all the woman with the big boobs and martini in hand was the last straw."
3,Oh Em Gee....it's a wannabe DDR!,"Negative: there are only like 8 songs on this thing, and what's with the backgrounds? one background displays a lady with a margarita glass and a HUGE bust and thighs...whoooa. And that noise in the background of every song...it sounds either like an ever-trotting horse or a very well-timed ping-pong match. It gets aggrivating.Positive: Well if the songs get too annnoying, you can mute the T.V. and use your own songs, just play it on your C.D. player. Me and my friend tried it with some cheap Spice Girls song, and it worked perfectly. I like how much of a work-out it gives you! LOL it's overall a pretty good toy. Cheesy graphics, good fun!"
1,Not age appropriate,Who ever rated this for 5+ I'm betting doesn't have a 5 year old nor has even been around a 5 yr old! The three adults in the room couldn't do this game on the lowest level! Its way too difficult. A child should be able to enjoy any toy right out of the box...not this one. Maybe an early teen could enjoy it but even at that its pretty cheesy. I also doubt it would last very long. We bought this for our 5 year old niece...it's going back to the store tomorrow.
1,The worst toy ..waste of money,Horrible toy. The first thing we noticed was the horrible smell from the plastic mat when we took it out of the box. Setting up was easy however you need to adhere this mat to the floor with sticky pads that are provided. The sticky pads are useless to you the next time you use this mat and they are hard to peel off your floor.It is impossible to dance to this toy because it goes way too fast that even an adult can't do it. You can not slow it down. The music is absolutely terrible and sounds like one of those cheap childrens musical toys. The graphics are absolutely horrible and inappropriate for young children.This product should be recalled. I have never had such a terrible toy in the house as this. I can't return it because it was sent to us from someone in the USA as we live in Canada so this will be heading out to our next garbage dump run except we will keep the duracell batteries it came with!!
2,Lots of Fun - But it broke after a week.,"Our children (7 & 5 yr boys) loved it. (Mom and Dad also liked it.) The kids enjoyed the games and dancing so much we had to drag them away at night. The boys got lots of excercise while playing video games.But, we had it only for a week and it stopped working - when you push the on button nothing shows up on the TV - it isn't because the batteries died. Since the boys had so much fun, we are going to try and get a replacement from a store.Note - It has component video connection ( Red / Yellow / White plugs) so make sure your TV has that type of connection or you will need to buy an adapter for this game.I'd give this toy five stars if the replacement lasts, but because this one broke after so little use I can not give it a good score."
3,Bedtime stories,"It's an easy read, with interviews of assorted veterans of the PJ world. Most of these guys worked in the film era, so don't expect much on digital technique. In fact it's more about the human experience of these people, as they do their job as silent, passive witnesses to history. I can't say I learned anything, but I did read the whole thing, so it was cheap entertainment. If you are looking for practical advice or technical guidance you need to look for something less dated. These are bedtime stories, kinda like the stories my grandma told me years ago.Dave"
4,Good if taken as what it is: a basic guide,"This book clearly is not meant for advanced journalism students but it's perfect for someone working as a stringer or a novice who is thinking about entering this field. The most important aspects of photojournalism are covered, including a section on electronic ethics. If ever you needed a good reason to keep ethical standards then the ""Photoshop War"" run by Reuters last year in Lebanon is an excellent example: one of their photojournalist was actively creating even more photo-edited havoc and carnage than what was actually happening... and slanting the images to make it appear as if Israel was indiscrimately destroying Beirut. I'd like to see an updated edition of this book that takes this into account but I doubt I'll see it any time soon."
4,"Nice stories, good insights","I liked this book because it was stories told by photojournalists, giving examples versus a ""textbook"" approach. It showed that the resourcefulness, perseverence and creativity of photojournalists is what makes them successful, not necessarily following specific guidelines that cannot work in every situation. Very entertaining read."
2,Way too basic,"If you are extreamly new at photography or maybe working for a high-school newspaper, this book would work well.For anyone that is serious about hard-core photojournalism, like the professionals the book highlights, I do not recomend it.I was looking for a book on some on ways to break into some of the big names. I just assumed that since it was an AP book."
4,HR Textbook,Overpriced like all textbooks but I had to buy it for a class. For a textbook it covers the material well and is generally a good reference. I might keep this one.
3,Everything you need to know about HR and a bunch of stuff you didn't,"This book covers everything you can possibly hope for, but it's very wordy and repetitive. It's meant as a text book, but probably more appropriate as a reference manual because it's so large."
3,"So yeah, I enjoyed the remake!","Personally, this movie is worth the effort for the cast. Some great people are in here - in fact most of the main players are in my ""favourites"" list. I liked Vince in the starring role - he's a great actor - although I thought there were times he looked a bit too ""camp"" - especially when he was watching the car sinking. He wasn't as scary as Perkins, but then not many people are!I thought Anne Heche, one of my favourite actresses, was excellent - and, of course, she's very gorgeous and always watchable.One of my favourite actors, William H. Macy was great as usual.And one of my favourite actresses, Julianne Moore, was also great.One point which has to be made: This is the only version of Psycho which features an appearance by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers!Overall, this movie isn't bad at all and works on certain levels, fails on others but is great entertainment all the same.When are they gonna remake Psycho 2?!"
4,"A fair remake, but not as good as the origional.","I saw this movie on Stars a few years ago. I thought it was a fair remake with good acting. Anne Heche did a good job as Marian Crane but nothing can compare to Janet Leigh's performance. The dvd features includes a documentary, theatrical trailers, commentary with Anne Heche,Vince Vaughn and Gus Van Sant, production notes, wide screen format and web links. What can you say, they tried. See the origional first and then see the remake. You be the judge on if it is as good as the origional."
1,Pointless remake.,"I still can't beleive that a fine director like Van Sant could have made this junk. It's an exact word for word replica of Hitchcock's classic. When I first rented it I was very excited. But when I began watching it and saw that EVEN THE OPENING TITLES WERE EXACTLY AS THE FIRST ONE'S. I really got bored. And sometimes, you can throw a big HA HA! because there are some scenes that look like if it is comedy. Anne Heche's performance was terrible (she even won an award for worst supporting actress). What was the idea of copying every line of the first one. It doesn't bring anything new. If you haven't seen it, trust me, don't watch it. You'll regret later."
1,What was that????,"Okay, i have seen all of the Psycho movies from I-IV:The Beginning, and they all run as perfect in my book. I was actually excited to see that they were re-making Psycho (the greatest movie i have ever seen, hell i would have loved it if they remade all of them). What i saw, was PATHETIC. This is the worst attempt at making a film i have ever seen. Personally i believe that Anne Heche was just insulting the movie, not to mention Vince Vaughn. You can not perfect perfection, and this movie proves that. Psycho is a God among movies, the re-make rates well below the devil. Maybe if i had seen this one first before the original) i wouldnt have thought it so bad, or judged it so harshly, however i would not be a rabbid Psycho fan if i had to judge the movie on those terms. So as a lesson to anyone who wants to recreate another perfect film, DON'T!!!!"
1,piece of crap!!!!!!!,This movie was suppose to be the remake of one of the greatest movies ever.It turned out to the biggest pileof horse **** ever!!!!!!! If you would like to be scared get the first oneand the book
1,"Totally, utterly pointless.","If you've seen the first one, you will be severely disappointed. Vince Vaughn's acting is so forced and subconscious I wonder how he even got the part. I would remark on Ann Heche's performance but it was so unforgettable I can't."
2,"A creditable effort but, no.","Van Sant is a good director, but he really didn't do much for promoting Hitchcock other than to make you appreciate the original Psycho more than his remake. Vince Vaughn is the best feature of the film, but the other actors seemed uncomfortable and a little bit snobby. The worst thing about this remake is that all the kids who haven't seen the original that have been bred to graphic violence as the standard for a ""good"" horror film are now going to avoid it because they have seen the remake. If you are considering this as a purchase do yourself a favor and get the original instead - it's light years ahead of this one."
1,Collected dust in the bargain bin by the dozens,"It made it from the full-priced theaters to the $3.99 ""pre-viewed"" video bargain-bin at our local Blockbuster store inside of 3 months. 'Nuff said."
3,"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It","Some movies are so great they should never, ever be done over, and the original ""Psycho"" is one of them. Whoever had the idea of doing a remake should have his head read. Gus Van Sant deserves an A for the effort but this project was doomed from the start; there is no way he could have hoped to improve on the original, so what was the point? Vince Vaughn is a good actor and I liked him very much in ""The Lost World"" but let's face it, Norman Bates he ain't. Shooting the remake in color actually lessens the impact of the film. I have to give Anne Heche credit for giving a very good performance as Marian Crane, and the scene of her rolling her eyes in disbelief as Norman says that a boy's best friend is his mother is priceless. This ""Psycho"" is not a bad movie but there is no way it can touch the Hitchcock version. Rent this one, if you must see it, but buy the original."
1,Brings nothing new to the legend.,"This remake reminded me a lot of the Omen remake.In a word.Pointless!!!It's basically a screen by screen reshoot of the original with one new scene.Those who have seen the new version will know what scene I refer to.Ok.......The good?...........I'm thinking............Still thinking..................The acting was passable.That's it for the good.The bad?Everything else.It just wasn't necessary to remake this movie.Some movies are not in need of a reboot.Psycho is a prime example.How can you possible out do the original?You don't and probably wont......ever.The score was the same.The plot was the same.Everything was identical and that is what ultimately dooms this version.I knew this would be seen and quickly forgotten by the majority of movie watchers and I was right.Do I recommend this version?For ""Psycho"" fans who simply cannot live without seeing anything and everything ""Psycho"" related?Sure go ahead and rent it.For the rest of us?Skip it, it's a stinker."
2,Why?,"Why remake a film without adding ANYTHING new? It's a frame by frame remake filmed in color with just different actors. What was the point in this? If the studio was just interested in spending money, I have a script in the works I could have sold them for a fifth of the price.Unless you have a revulsion towards black and white movies, just watch the original.I give this one two stars because regardless of who or what is directing or starring in the movie, it's still a good, spooky story."
3,A BIG DISAPPOINTING HOMAGE TO THE SUPREME CLASSIC,"THIS MOVIE IS A GOOD MOVIE IF EVERYONE DID NOT KNOW ITS ENDING. THERE ARE CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT MAKE THIS REMAKE INFERIOR. THE HOTEL SEQUENCE BETWEEN SAM AND MARION WAS VERY TEMPID. THE NUDITY FACTOR WAS NOT CALL FOR. WHEN MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE CAME I WAS VERY PLEASED BUT THE INFAMOUS SHOWER SEQUENCE HAD A LOT PROBLEMS FOR ME. WHY WAS FOOTAGE OF STORM CLOUDS? BUT A PLUS,IT WAS MORE GORIER. AND ""MOTHER"" WAS NOT AS SCARY AS THE ORIGINAL ""MOTHER"".BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE. THE CASTING WAS GOOD. THE SHOCKING ENDING WAS CHANGED FOR THE SOMEWHAT BETTER. AND THE UPDATED DIALOGUE WAS OK.OVERALL, THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS PROJECT SHOULD FOLLOWING THIS GOLDEN RULE: NEVER REMAKE A SUPER CLASSIC LIKE PSYCHO!!!"
3,"OK, so it's not great ...","... but it's enjoyable. The film isn't scary, but does keep you in suspense. I would recomend you rent this film rather than buy it, but I would imagine quite a few people would enjoy it (Mind you, loads of people on amazon seem to hate it.) To be honest, I can't see why they don't like it. It seems that people are picking it apart because it's not as good as the origional, but that's stupid, because not every film is a classic. The strangest thing about the movie is the ending (I won't tell you what it is).Watch this movie, despite it's bad reviews. You never know, you just might be too scared to go in the shower ..."
2,Why make a remake if you are not going to take liberties?,"Psycho is just a shot for shot remake of the original classic. It would have been great if Vince Vaughn had not been cast in it. He's too cool to be creepy, and too tough to be meek. The rest of the cast does admirably, but why do a remake if you are not going to change things? It would have thrown Hitchcock fans off guard ( for better or worse ) and allowed for some things to happen that we always wanted to happen in the original. At least the remake of Wages Of Fear ( Sorcerer ) got a new plot, and new settings. Bottom line is that there is no reason to see this if you have already seen the original."
4,Pointless remake that was actually good!,"True, i must admit it was a stupid idea to remake Psycho scene for scene. There was absolutely no point to this remake and it could have been done so much better had it been at least a little different from the original. And i must say that Vince Vaughn is teribly terribly miscast as Norman Bates. But the eerie score, the beautiful scenery,and the bright colors make up for that. i enjoyed this more than i enjoyed the original, only because of the vibrant color, and i know that if i hadn't seen the original, i would have liked this even more. The only problem is that it is a bit slow moving for modern audiences looking for thrills, but it does have its moments, especially the last 15 minutes or so. if you haven't seen the original, watch this, if you have, don't, I'm sure that you will be disappointed. i however, liked it better......"
1,Beside the Point,"Simply stated, this near shot-for-shot remake of the original Alfred Hitchcock classic does nothing the original did not do the first time around-- and do much better. While the cast ranges from interesting to merely adequate, and the film itself is unusually faithful to its original source, it lacks the freshness, the nervousness, and the power which the original retains to this day."
1,1960(*****) vs 1998(no star),Anthony Perkins will really become PSYCHO if he is alive to see this ugly remade movie!! Hitchcock demonstrated an extraordinary character study in his movie. Here they have made a perfect demonstration of how not to remake a movie....I do not recommend this movie even to my enemy. I have seen the original version 21 times. Not once i could sit and watch this movie without cursing all those who are responsible for remaking this.
3,don't believe all the bad reviews!,"there is really nothing to hate about this film. good acting, excellent cinematography, and a wonderful score. any fan of the original can appreciate this film. it's the same great story!"
2,I join the consensus,"What's the point? This has been asked many times: Why was Psycho redone, scene by scene? I guess someone who did not see the original would find it intriguing and fascinating. And there are some more explicit skin scenes, a la post 1965, which do make it look more real. So it's not a total loss and maybe worth seeing, but probably not owning."
3,Gus Van Sant's Psycho,"I think that this movie was better than Psycho III and IV, but not better than the original and II. Although, there are some things that weren't even close to the original. They use a different house and a different motel! If I were you, I would see the original first before you see this and compare the two."
3,Not a bad effort to remake a classic!,"This DVD is loaded with bonus material. There's an interesting 3-way commentary by Sant, Heche, and Vaughn, and a short behind-the-scenes documentary, trailer, production notes, cast & crew bios, web links, screensaver, etc. Quite a lot for the money. And the movie's not bad, either, despite all the criticism it's gotten. Director Sant wanted to do a faithful recreation and he did, with only a few minor changes. Recommended for all Anne Heche fans in particular, and all Psycho fans in general."
2,"a kind of ""naked gun"" horror movie","First of all, to everyone that says stuff like ""Psycho better in color"". Hitchcock did an exellent job doing it in black/white, because it gave us a sence of darkeness and felling of kind of, ""don't trust in people etc"" (Marion and the policeman). So doing a ""color-film"", is completely wrong, I think. But ""The remake"" isn't all that bad. I mean, the dialouge between Marion and Norman is really humoures! Just listen to, them when they talk! It sounds like they reading from a dusty script from the late 50:ies. And the shower scene. It remaindes me of one of the terrible, discusting ""Psycho-sequles""! The only thing that makes me think of the masterpiece it self is the score. But even that sounds weak. I like Ann Heache and Julianne Moore though. But Viggo and Vince are all wrong for this!!! No, I think you all should see the original piece, if you are looking for a good scare..."
4,Hailing the memory of Hitchcock,"I don't understand the viewers who were so totally disappointed in this remake. I thought that it was done amazingly well! As far as I can tell, the film stuck very close to the original: script, charactarization, dialouge, and even the filming was completely Hitchcock. One might even say it was a steal. The entire film hails the memory of the late master of suspence! My only disappointment was that Vince Vaughn was not as convincing in the part as Anthony Perkins. All in all though, a good choice."
1,EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!,"Come on! I can't imagine why ANYONE would give this film higher than 1 or 2 stars. It was horrible! The acting ws the worst in any film in recent memory. Norman Mastubating while watching Marion undress is absolutely stupid! Why do you need that? Perhaps they added scenes like that (along with a touch more graphic violence) to gain that ""special"" R-rating? I can't express how much my girlfriend and I hated this movie."
2,That the new Psycho does not equal the original in anyway .,"The only good thing that came out of this movie is that we learned that today's movie going public has to told what to see. In the original everything was implied and you have to imagine it. Plus, kids today have to be scared by blood and gore. None of that in this movie. Is that one of the many and I do mean many reasons this movie tanked."
5,"Now, its a masterpiece!","10 reasons of why Gus Van Sant's version is better: 1. Vince Vaughn 2. Anne Hetch 3. the sound is in Dolby Digital instead of ""HI-FI Mono"" whitch makes the soundtrack even greater. 4. It's in colour. 5. The picture quality is(of course)mutch better. 6. Gus Van Sants extra shots. 7. The helikopter-shot,and some others that Hitchcock couldn't make. 8. The house. The motel. The shower curtain."
1,[BAD],"I'm sorry to say this, but this film is just a piece of garbage!I don't know what the actors and the filmmakers was thinking of!See the old classic and REAL ""Psycho"" with good old Alfred in the director-chair and the perfect actor Antony Perkins! That is a REAL horrorclassic and will allways be!"
2,If it ain't broke...,"I'll cut to the chase-what's the point? Remaking a terrific film shot-by-shot with only a few minute changes isn't going to put the entertainment world on it's ear. No insult to the fine cast, and I especially like Vince Vaughn, but he isn't Anthony Perkins. Juliette Moore and William H. Macy do stand out, though. For a movie filmed and set in 1998, a lot of the clothes and furnishings seem awfully retro. I'll admit that the murder scenes are well shot and the climax is okay. But if you turn the sound down I'm sure you'll be able to hear Hitchcock and Perkins turning in their graves. View as a curiousity, but stick with the 1960 original."
4,A remake worth watching,"I was impressed at how closely this remake stuck by, not only the storyline, but the feel of the original Hitcock thriller. Some viewers may not see the point in the creation of a remake that contains few changes from the original. But I think this one was worth it. It also gives the modern film industry a chance to show that appreciation for the flavor of true suspense has not been lost. You will still be frightened by this film. Vince Vaughn definitely gives 'creepy' a proper definition through his performance."
1,STAY AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN!!!,"Talk about a re-make stinker!! ....A total waste of film! Who in the hell was watching the store when this was being made nothing good at all...Vince Vaughn couldn't make ""Norman Bates"" work at all!! who cast him for this role? The whole thing is beyond a down right bad movie re-make..."
1,psycho,"Some movies are not ment to be re-made. Psycho is a classic and should have a patent on it so crappy verisons of it can't be made. This re-make sucked big time. It's hard for me to find a movie to put down, but I finally found one. Vince Vaughn can't play Norman bates at all. Nobody can play Norman Bates as good as Anthony Perkins. The whole movie was like an exact copy of the original. The movie was not as classy. Vince jacking it while watching the girl was disgusting and the death pose of the girl was not very appealing either. Julianne Moore and Anne Heche did ok though. I could their scenes again. Don't bother with this one."
1,DON'T MESS WITH A CLASSIC.,"When word got out they had plans to do a re-make of Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho. One thing came to mind ""BAD IDEA""...This movie suck and failed and was a Insult to Hitchcock.. You want to see Psycho Buy the Orginal 1960 classic Movie. It is far Superior and done by the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock.This Re-make is not worth your time or money."
1,I had to see it!,"WOW, JUST AS BAD AS YOU THINK IT IS!!!! BEGS TO BE HIDDEN AWAY AND NEVER SEEN AGAIN!!!!!!!"
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD,"There is a saying, ""They don't make them like that anymore."" And I hope they don't make them like this movie anymore."
1,What?,"Okay no, first of all do not remake Hitchcock movies! He is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time. His films are all classics. Why do people try to remake them? They don't need to be remade, stop it! The only thing this movie was good for was to show people that a remade 90's version of a classic 60's version, shot for shot of the original, is just a waist of time! Gus Van Sant is a good director! He had a the cast and the money, so he should of made his own suspence thriller instead of trying to remake a classic. You just can't top Hitchcock, I'm sorry, no matter who you are!"
1,Worst Remake Yet,"Psycho is the type of film that doesn't need a remake. But the worst part is that it's the same as the original, word-by-word, scene-by-scene. Gus Van Sant must've been smoking some strong weed when he made this film.Why watch this mess, while I can watch Hitchcock's classic? If there was a 0 stars on this thing, I word give it 0 stars. Like the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
1,Mother rolled over in her grave.,This was even worse then the remake of Casablanca with David Soul as Rick. Just god awful. And in color.? Compleatly kills the mood.
3,"A Faithful remake? ....yes, but why bother?","Ok, yes this is a good remake of the original Hitchcock classic. But as good as it is, Van Zant just doesn't have the touch that Hitchcock had.Plus there are a few mistakes that ol'Hitch wouldn't have made.1 Anne Heche has absolutly no personality in the role of MarionCrain. She's just bland.2 Vince Vaughn is just to old to play Norman Bates. Plus he'snot creepy enough.His Norman plays like the guy you meet at a really bad party.You know the one that you desperately try to avoid but can't!The only bright spots in the movie are William H Macy andViggo Mortensen.Macy is perfect as the small time dectective.Mortensen is stud o'licious as the boyfriend. We even get tosee some hot buns! Imagine if we could have been treated tothe sight of John Gavin's hot buns in the original!Anyway it's an ok film. I wouldn't recomend buying it unlessyour either a real fan of Van Zant's work, Or a fan of ViggoMortensen."
2,ok,"I am a huge PSYCHO fan, and when I first heard of this one, I thought""color"" I was inpressed that they kept the smme music and most of the original lines, but some parts just diddnt match up. Like when the shrink was explaining Norman, that was nothing compared to the way the shrink did it in the original. And as far as re-creating Norman, forget it. That new guy was plain awful, he realy messed Norman up. He needs to think realy hard before he tries to match Mr.Anthony Perkins again."
3,It was OK,The remake was ok but i like the old version better because it had great acting in it and was much scarier. Vince Vaughn was ok playing Norman Bates but Anthony Perkins was the best at it
2,"Not bad, but nevertheless...","I'm sorry Ms. Heche, but you're no Janet Leigh. Nor is Gus Van Saint Alfred Hitchcock, William Macy Martin Balsam, the lovely Julianne Moore Vera Miles, and most certainly, nor is the new guy playing Norman Bates anywhere near Anthony Perkins.I understand this wasn't Mr Vant Saint idea but the studio's. Nevertheless, it's a BLASPHEMY! A very well made one, a respectful one, no doubt, but a BLASPHEMY all the same!"
3,pretty good,"I found this to be sort of entertaining. I found the original to be very interesting, and exciting to watch, and since this was a remake in colour i thought that this would be as exciting. Even though I found this movie to be boring at parts, I found the performances of all actors to be well especially Vince Vaughn as Norman, and William H. Macy as the detective"
2,Waste of celluloid,"I'm sorry Vince(Norman Bates)I love you babe, but this movie SUCKED!! I went to see it in the theatre, and people were laughing through it and rightly so, I on the other hand , wanted to cry when I saw Norman dressed as his mother, because it was just that bad. It was a terrible idea to remake this movie shot for shot, the original one was scary because of what you couldn't see because of the standards at the time. Now audiences are so used to everything being so expicit that the movie just doesn't work in the 90's. Skip this and watch the original one, I found it scary and believe me I'm pretty jaded. Also if you love Vince Vaughn don't buy this, you'll only be dissapointed."
2,A Copy is a Copy is a Copy,"This film is in good company with ""A Star is Born"" and ""Mame"" - in as much as the remakes do not improve on the original. I think we all know by now that the blood used in the shower scene in the original was really Hershey's chocolate syrup. And that is the difference between suspense and gore.I knew this was a cheesy remake as soon as I saw the stolen money. This was supposed to be $400,000, yet it only showed Ms. Crane with two stacks of 50 $100 bills ($10,000 last time I checked.) Perhaps her boss was committing insurance fraud by telling everyone it was the larger amount.If a film can be improved upon my remaking it, then I say go for it. If the only purpose is to provide an updated color version, then forget it. Who want to see a paint-by-number version of the Mona Lisa anyway?"
1,No where near as good as the original,Why would anyone in there right mind want to remake one of the greatest films ever made . Why not remake some god awful film that does need improving . William H. Macy is perhaps the only good thing to step out of this pile of rubbish . Its a shot by shot remake so why settle for this when you could rent or buy the original .
1,A Disastrous Experiment,"The idea of remaking this Alfred Hitchcock classic in color should have been abandoned during preproduction. Unfortunately, director Gus Van Sant follows through on his pointless conceit and squanders a good cast in the process. Though the 1998 version of ""Psycho"" has its defenders, Van Sant's ""experiment"" emerges as a bad practical joke."
1,DOES NOT DESERVE THE 1 STAR!,Winner of 2 Golden Raspberry Awards: WORST DIRECTOR and WORST REMAKE OR SEQUEL. Need I say more?
4,"Check this out, if you dare....","Well, I have say that this wasn't too bad for a remake. It was done in the same style, that original was done. Vince Vaughn was very good as Norman. While Anne Heche was alright as Marion. Vigo Mortensen did alright as Sam. I really like Julianne Moore as Lila. She really gave her some attitude. That and Robert Forster did a very good job as the Doctor. So, go ahead and this check out, if you dare!!!!"
1,Crap,"I don't want to even give this one star! IT STINKS. Period. Why on God's green earth would you remake a classic movie??? What is the point?! Both Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche stink as actors in the first place so I kind of knew it would be a bomb. My boyfriend and I watched the first 10 minutes of it and then he got up from the chair. I said ""where are you going?"" and he said ""to turn this **** off and go return it to the video store."" And that he did!"
2,Not an entertaining movie,"The casting of the movie was completely wrong in my opinion. Maybe this could have been something better, I think, if the lead actors were totally different but it remains a big question mark. As stands, it is an informal experiment in why movies can't be remade shot by shot and still retain their good qualities (even though this movie is not shot by shot, i think, but it is damn close). It really proves there was only one Hitchcock, and it's good to see just to remind people of that. One can't watch the movie without getting nostalgic to see the original."
2,FAILED ATTEMPT,"I'm another HUGE hitchcock fan with the whole collection owned and anticipated to see a movie retold that has and will always ramin a personal favorite. But I was dissapointed coming out of the theater... The scipt, I'm sure was identical and I am fond of Vince Vuahgn. Unfortunatly he simply cannot compare to the great Anthony Perkins. Gus Van Sant is a great director and I can see the passion that he has for such a masterpiece. But why bother even attempting to reamake a classic masterpiece. YOU CAN'T REMAKE PERFECTION."
2,Only one thing,"If this version is so damn great, then why is Robert Bloch's novel credited AFTER the film ends? Answer: He wasn't the only one embarrassed by this treatment."
1,Don't waste your time--rent the original.,"Several aspects of the original movie made cinematic history, and here Gus Van Sant's frank plagiarism (how can you improve a classic?) would cause Hitchcock to roll over in his grave. The director shot everything scene-by-scene the same as Hitchcock, except he added a pointless 2-second shot of a sheep or something in the road, with a blue lense on the camera. Who does he think he is, David Lynch? Vince Vaughn can't TOUCH Anthony Perkins' shy, subtle Norman Bates with a 10-foot pole. He makes the character an obviously perverted individual, which destroys the entire premise of the movie. Van Sant took a piece of American pop culture and ruined it."
4,A WINNER,"Let the major critics wallow in sentimentality over memories of the original and engage in the expected Hitchcock idol worhip. Following the original literally is a compliment to him, and not unimaginative mimicry. See this film. and putting prejudice aside, I think you'll enjoy a fine and exciting remake. To be sure, probably no one can duplicate the shower scene, but that aside, I found the movie first rate. I think color does not distract from it all that much. I would think that for those who have not seen the original, it will be viewed as a pretty scary movie.The psychobabble at the end was not all that bad for that sort of thing.The DVD version is quite good although the menu is difficult to navigate,"
1,Why!,"If you're going to see ""Psycho,"" see the original Hitchcock classic. The remake is junk. The performances are ridiculous and pathetic attempts to recapture the brilliance Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins brought to the roles of Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche ought to go to over-actors anonymous! I found the color, ultimately, quite distracting. Especially with the horrid day-glo colors they had Anne Heche in. Gus Van Sant should have found something better than a remake to follow the wonderful ""Good Will Hunting"" with. This movie is a strong argument for why studios should stop producing remakes. The increasing rate of remakes being churned out each year is disgusting. Ignore this piece of celluloid trash and see Alfred Hitchcock's classic original ""Psycho""!"
1,As bad as GOOD WILL HUNTING...,"Watch Gus direct a shot-for-shot remake of one of the greatest shockers of all time...Watch Gus bring nothing new into the mix...Watch the cast desperately try to give different line readings to the(almost)identical script...Watch Julianne Moore, William H. Macy & Vince Vaughn blemish their careers...Marvel at the blinding colour of this farce...Marvel at the stupidity of all involved...Pray he doesn't try the same thing with THE BIRDS..."
1,What's happening to this guy?,"Gus Van Sant has directed some very fine films (""Drugstore Cowboy"" ""To Die For"" ""My Own Private Idaho,"" and i'll admit it, ""Good Will Hunting"" wasn't too bad either). But what the hell is this? ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite film, and the idea of remaking it did not offend me, but what did the was stiff acting and Van Sant's seeming lack of creativity (a first for him, unless you count ""Good Will Hunting""). Heche and Vaughan sputter, they say their dialogue like they were reading it off a cue card. Vaughan is not menacing or threatening as Norman Bates, but a laughable idiot who does not emit any fear in the viewer whatsoever. Skip this ..."
1,Terminally boring...and predictable!,"If you're going to redo Psycho, don't do it this way! I mean the movie is a shot-for-shot muddling of the classic...with an exception of the subliminal messages planted in the death of the detective(who didn't laugh at the cow?)this movie is devoid of any creativity what-so-ever! Vince Vaughn actually makes Norman Bates seem normal! Well...not really, but he is normal compared to Anthony Perkins perfect performance as that wacko. Casting Pee-wee Herman as Norman would have been genius. So anyways...avoid this and stick with the original."
1,"Idiocy, thy name is Van Sant","Every print of this film should be burned, and every single person who had anything at all to do with its production in any way, shape or form whatsoever should be publicly flogged."
1,Psycho remake proves that even classic films could stink,"The new remake of Psycho just showes how bad some great films could really turn out. Despite a still decent script driving it, Psycho falls apart. The thing that made the original great were its performances and excellent mood. This looses both through ackward and downright bad casting and added touches that only lower and destroy the intrigue and mystery that made the 1960 version worth watching over and over again. I don't think that this deserves to even be watched once."
1,Send van Sant to the shower - now!!!,"Forgive me if I seem rude, but I don't know how to put it in other words - I simply don't know! ""Psycho 1998"" is pure FILTH - an INSULT to each and every movie buff! If there was any DECENCY left in the ""industry"", Gus van Sant would have replaced Anne Heche or William H. Macy on the set and REALLY be STABBED to death!!!"
1,THERE SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN A REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC!,"This is one of the worst remakes ever made! Anyone who thinks that this move is even remotely decent should be sent to a mental institution, because they are brain dead idiots. I could make abetter movie about a case of a missing seashell. I need to blow chunks because this movie makes me sick."
1,Criminal,"I have a big problem with remakes to begin with, but a (for all intents and purposes) SHOT-FOR-SHOT recreation of a HITCHCOCK film? Are you kidding me? Where did they get the nerve? Please. This was a waste of everyone's time and money."
5,A Fresh Look at a Great Classic,"How anyone could have not liked this film is beyond me. It is exactly like the original (which is excellent) except that it is in color and features some new actors. I enjoyed it a lot and I think everyone else will too. If you didn't like the original, you probably won't like this one either. But, if you did, you're in for a treat."
1,PSYCHO,DIRECTOR GUS VAN SANT IS STUPID THERE IS NO NEED FOR A REMAKE WHEN THE ORIGINAL TERRIFING MASTERPIECE THAT ALFRED HITCHCOCK DIRECTED IS STILL THE BEST EVERYONE KNOWS AS WALL AS I DO THAT THIS MOVIE THIS PICE OF CRAP REMAKE NEED'S TO GO TO ONLY ONE PLACE AND THAT IS THE TRASH
1,Hitchcock and Perkins are still rolling in their graves,"I don't give this 1 star,I give it no stars.What... were they think?Well,nothing.Vince Vaughn holds no candle to Anthony Perkins,Vaughn was totally not the choice for the famous role of Norman Bates,only Perkins did that back in 1960 and still does it know 42 years later.Nowonder it took Gus-Van Snat 4 years to make another movie after this piece of ....Hitchcock's version is one of the best movies ever made.Don't rent the ... remake,rent the classic one instend."
1,Bad,"I loved the 1960 version of ""Psycho."" It is one of my favorite films and I even own it. That is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement and one of the best horror films. Anyone who loves horror movies or classics and has not yet seen that film should see it.This new version by Gus Van Sant is terrible. The acting is very poor to begin with. I have never been a fan of Vince Vaughn, but he ruined the part of Norman Bates. He laughs at totally inapproporaite moments and makes it sound forced. Anthony Perkins did a magnificent job as Norman Bates. Anne Heche is also bad and overacts during most of her scenes. I was very disappointed in this film, and I wich it had never been made. Just because this is a shot-for-shot remake of the original, seeing this does not mean that you've seen ""Psycho."" Seeing this film merely means that you have seen a movie trying to be ""Psycho,"" but instead fails miserably.This is a bad bad film."
1,BAD bad BAD bad BAD,"One of the worst ideas ever. Why remake something that is perfect? Gus Van Sant, you will never be Hitchcock. Your movies will be forgotten, especially this rubbish, ten years from now, as the Master's will be remembered forever. If you're going to do a remake exactly, don't add your own creations such as the woman and the clouds. They make 0 sense and you should not be allowed to ever make a movie ever again. If anyone has not seen the original, do so. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS."
1,psyhoctically terrible,"When I first saw the theatrical teaser trailer in theaters Ithought this was going to be amazing. A fresh look at a true classichow wrong I was. I was sure that this was going to be on the same level of what Scorsesse did for his Cape Fear remake. Then I heard it was a shot for shot remake just in color. This, mind you, is not a remake its plagerism in the worst degree. I saw it in the theater and was just disgraced. Then I rented it on DVD and it was just more of a disgrace.The commentary on the DVD is incredibly annoying. Especially Anne Heche you really get the feel that she doesnt really regard the original very highly here. The costume design on Heche is terrible and that shower scene with the intercut lightning? Its just distracting and takes you out of the scene. This movie could have been extremly horrific if it had been handled in a nineties fashion.Major dissapointment all around. END"
1,An insult to a great movie,I thought that this movie was horrible. I bet that Hitchcock is rolling over in his grave because the remake of his moive was awful.
1,Tsk Tsk Tsk,"A true waste of celluloid. I was sorry I gave up the hour plus of my time to view this junk; remaking a classis is hard enough (and at times pointless to even attempt it) but with the group of actors assembled here, it's a wonder a studio even offered to make it. Cheezy, unrealistic performances, nothing to sink your teeth into like the original. Sorry but there's just no one like Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh and Alfred Hitchcock."
1,Totally awful,"The main problem with this movie is that it's basically just a colorized version of the 1960 original, with a different cast. And that's where it really doesn't work. The dialogue has not been updated to the 1990s, and sounds ridiculous. Also, the situation between marion and sam is also way outdated. In 1960, it was feasible that a proper young woman would not bring a man to the home she shares with a conservative sister. Sam lives in his store, so a hotel in the afternoon is their only choice. But in this day and age, do they need to ""sneak"" around during lunchtime? Give me a break. Also, Sam can't marry her because he can't afford to support her, he's paying alimony, etc. That is also very outdated and totally stupid.If a real remake had been attempted, complete with an updated dialogue and story changes to suit a more modern era, it might have worked. But to shoot frame for frame of a film that is 40 years old is idiotic. What was the point? Just to say it's been done?"
1,Reminiscent of Mrs. Bates...,"In other words, a lifeless corpse of a movie.This movie is exactly like the original, the only differences being that it is not scary, interesting, engaging, or convincing.The movie equivalent of a Paint by Numbers knockoff of the Mona Lisa.Van Sant's next projects include remakes of the following:""Gone With the Wind"" with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks""Citizen Kane"" starring Tom Cruise with a soundtrack by N'SYNC""The Grapes of Wrath"" starring Bob Saget, Rosie O'Donnell (as ""Ma""), and George ""Goober"" Lindsey.Hooray for Hollywood."
2,Pretty boring!,"I haven't seen Hitchcocks version from 1960, so I can't compare these two. But this one was boring. The killings were so fake, that no one will ever believe. I didn't know if I should cry or laugh. The movie was so predictable that it's a shame. The only thing which is keeping me from rating it 1 star, is Vince Vaughn. He's a great actor, and I think he can be proud of this one. Rated R for...hey! what is it rated R for? Don't ask me."
3,Not the worst movie ever made!,Let me start off by saying that this remake is a pale imatation of the original masterpiece of modern horror. The worst remake is The Wolfman also released (someone should put that poor canine out of it's misery.) On a personal note one of the worst movies (which recived great reviews) I saw and wished I could have gotten my money back from was The Blair Witch Project.
2,A visual pleasure only,"I do own this remake of PSYCHO and its not nearly as good as it could have been. A visual pleasure without a doubt but, the story lacks because of the acting. These are all good actors but not in this film, seems to me the actors figured it was going to be a Hit, well maybe if they had tried a little harder with there roles it might have been. Remaking a movie shot for shot can be a bad idea and is in this case. No story changes,caused every momment to be predicted."
3,pretty good video,I wouldn't say it's the scariest video but it was pretty scary.I't was weird that when norman stabbed the private investigator a couple times in the face that the knife skipped it's eye.I would rent it again.It was pretty good.
1,What a waste of money!,"Stay clear of this movie. It was boring, dull, n a waste of money. Stick to the original."
2,Nice try...,"The very first time I saw the original ""Psycho"", I was totally hooked. It captivated me the way Hitchcock had selected the right lighting, actors/actresses and sets to bring the classic novel to life. The very first time I saw the new ""Psycho"", I was MAD. How could they even possibly try to duplicate Hitchcock's masterpeice millions had come to know and love? Many things wrong with it: a)It was poorly acted (that's the sugar coated statement) b)The added sexual content was un-needed c)The clothes were totally...I don't know. I am so mad. People who haven't seen the original and see this will surely be mislead with the grotesque material that was added. It is basicly dissing on Hitchcock. On top of all of this, I HAD to admire them for trying. It is certainly not easy to replicate a Hitchcock classic like this...but cheers to anyone who has the guts to try, knowing the pressure this action holds. Nice try...I gave it 2 stars."
2,For Psycho-philes only,"Why see the Gus Van Sant remake of Hitch's most famous film? One reason only: If you've seen the original and are curious as to what Gus got up to. Sad to say, it's not much. But let's get real. After the touchy-feely-cuddly, let's-pander-to-all-the-overachieving-masses glop of Good Will Hunting, it's safe to say Van Sant has long lost the indie spark that lit films like Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho and most recently, To Die For. If Gus had only followed his own vision, instead clinging to Sir Al's, this might have been a good film. Van Sant thinks that shooting this one almost by the books is an homage----but in fact it insults Hitch in the worst way. Can you imagine Alfred Hitchcock hacking out a remake of ""Citizen Kane""? It's called originality and courage in your own talent, Gus. Check into it, and OUT of the Bates Motel."
2,ONE STAR OR THREE?,"I did not see this in the theater but, since I am extremely familiar with the original ""Psycho"", this actually can be fun to watch. The HIDDEN KEY here for movie buffs is to watch the -- only on DVD -- version with the director/actors comments on the audio channel. You'll either love it or hate it but you'll fully understand what the director and actors (Leche and Vaughn are on the entire audio) were attempting to do and they even admit where they failed.One star rating if you watch it like any other DVD; three stars (for entertainment value and understanding where it goes or strays from Hitchcock) for the version with the director/actor audio."
1,Argh! What have they DONE?!,"I'll admit my bias right from the start--I'm an Anthony Perkins fan. But even if you're aren't, you'll notice that this film kind of drags and that Marion doesn't look as frightened of Norman Bates as she should be (compare this to the original where she's tired, but not squirming and trying to get away from Norman). I really don't see how this is a ""tribute"" to the original like the director claimed."
5,Amazing pancake batter!,This is by far the best pancake batter ever especially when using real buttermilk to mix it. I also add a tiny bit of bran or wheat flakes just to make it healthier!
4,Love It!!,I love this cooler it has enough space for all the stuff that I want to take with me on missions and yet it still keeps everything cool. glad I got this cooler.
4,Just a guide,"The book is a brief chronological account of Western political thought interspersed with some of the author's thoughts. I was disappointed at first when I realized how short this book I had bought was because I was hoping for some meaty reading, but I realized that the main purpose of this book is to direct the reader to the actual texts. Mansfield gives a short list at the end of the book of the best translations."
1,thumbs down,"I've docked this book a star for its awkward, unprofessional prose and another star for its frequent mangling of musical matter. For that matter, it doesn't seem to know who or what it's for. Its tone is patronizing. It contains no original thought or substance. If you are content with abbreviated, non-contextual (and therefore, in my opinion, virtually meaningless) explanations, you'll be happier with a pocket music dictionary Prefer music books written--with the television set off--by practicing musicians.(By the way, it appears that this book has not been edited. Among its typographical errors appears this curiosity: ""quartal"" is misspelled as ""cuartal"" throughout. Hmm...well, ""cuartel""--with an ""e""--is Spanish for ""quarter""....)"
2,Ouch!,"The Lake of Dead Languages is a romance novel junk thriller, perfect for someone who has never read a decent book. Everyone else will be sorely disappointed by this Secret History meets Flowers in the Attic rip-off. There are too many characters with multiple names, and an over abundance of scooby-doo a-ha! moments. The Latin theme is a pathetic attempt at trying to make the book scholarly. The main character is an unsympathetic wimp, who makes June Cleaver look like a militant feminist. 400 pages of brain rot. Stay Away."
2,Mediocre,"I made the mistake of buying this book simply because it was frequently compared to ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. This book only compares to Tartt's novel in the fact that it reads as though some middle school kid read ""The Secret History"" and copied the ideas poorly into a vague imitation.Ultimately, this is decent brain-candy if you don't mind a fluffy, superficial novel with an incredulous plot, but don't expect greatness."
4,Dark Fun,"While the book can be a bit predictable in some ways, Goodman writes an interesting, interwoven tale that keeps the pages turning. I found myself staying up past midnight to finish it. She shows intellect by including the Latin subplot, and yet even adolescent readers will find it a page-turner (but beware: sexual content).This is a fun, worthy read for mystery lovers who want more than the typical, bloody, mindless tale."
4,a good beach read,"Goodman creates a multi-layered story that revolves around her characters: Jane, Lucy and Matt primarily, with some other side supporting cast. Jane the main character ,in this story, is now being tormented by events of the past when she attended, as a student, the same school she teaches in. The author does a fantastic job of capturing the cold icy scenery that backgrounds this story and keeps the school itself isolated. The interactions, both innocent and manipulative, amoung friends twist the reader's emotion between shock and loss. The only slight with the book is you can guess fairly early who the tormentor is, however how the story unfolds and interacts smoothly makes it more than worth while."
5,Couldn't Put It down...,"This is such a great book. I haven't read many psychological thrillers but I can tell you this one kept me interested from the very first chapter. I didn't want this one to end. If you don't wanna hear things that go bump in the night, I suggest to you not to read this alone at night!!!"
3,Disappointingly predictable,"Thanks to the setting (a girls' boarding school on a gorgeous lake) and the characters (kind of stock, but nicely done) I enjoyed this book immensely right up until the mid-point. By then, I'd figured out every single aspect of the story and was simply reading to find out if I was correct. I was correct about every point! I can't enjoy a suspense book when the only suspense is ""When will the main character figure out everything that's been so blatantly foreshadowed through clumsy and obvious plotting?"" The epilog held the only mild surprise in the book (in which way the birthright originated). I'd figured it was orginating elsewhere (I don't want to be too specific and spoil the story). I also came to object to the way in which the characters were either plucky underestimated poor kids or narcissistic monsters born into privilege. It was too simplistic. Still, this would make an engrossing read for a vacation or plane ride."
3,"Started out fine, but then...","I enjoyed this book until the last 100 pages or so. I thought the author went off on too many tangents and it got boring after a while.The last few chapters were completely ridiculous with all the coincidences and ""surprises"" in store for the major characters."
2,How can Carol Goodman sleep at night?,"I picked up this book while traveling, entirely on the strength of an on-the-cover review comparing it to Donna Tartt's ""The Secret History."" What the cover review doesn't say, however, is that Goodman's ""atmospheric"" novel is little more than a clumsy mimicry of Tartt's chilling tome.While ""Languages"" is admittedly well-written, nearly EVERYTHING about it is an obvious plagiarism: the eerie private school setting, the lonely, dispossesed protagonist looking back with guilt at events of the past; the seemingly impenetrable clique of bright students, including an incestuous brother & sister duo; the study of a dead language under the line-crossing tutelage of a revered & mysterious mentor; an obsession with pagan ritual; and of course, a series of tragic deaths.If you haven't read Tartt's glittering novel, I'll admit you might enjoy this. If you have, however, you'll find little here of interest. (...)"
4,Better than I assumed,"This book was loaned to me by a co-worker. Initially when I started reading the book, I wondered why the author had incorporated so much Latin in the book. Mind you, Jane Hudson in the book is a Latin teacher and I thought some of it could have been eliminated and at times skipped a line or two because I didn't think it was relevant. I was unsure if I wanted to continue reading but I don't like starting a book and not finishing it. I will say I'm glad I did. The more I read, the more I was pulled into the story. Although I made my own predictions and was correct about them, there was always a twist and this is what kept me reading. I would definitely recommend. Like they say, don't judge a book by its cover!"
2,This book is too long and too slow.,"I seriously do not know what all the hoopla is about that is surrounding this book. Everyone seems to love it and I didn't. I don't know, maybe I missed something. This book is part Greek myth, part age old legend and part coming of age thriller. All in all, too many parts!! I kept waiting for something more to happen after I solved the mystery."
3,Has potential but needs more.,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, who said that the author here spent too much time describing and not enough time telling. And I think that did make this book drag in a few places.While it was a good story that Carol Goodman came up with, she could take a lesson from one of my favorite authors, Stephen King. King's style concerning dialog is what stands out about his writing, not whether the story's about a possessed car or a mad dog. The dialog flows, you can actually picture people talking like that, and they tell you what's going on. Goodman's story could use a bit more of that.I'm also not sure if the stuff about the relationship of three of the characters to the founder of the school really added anything to the story.Overall, it was a good, but not great, book. This author has potential."
3,The Lake of Dead Languages,"While I eagerly read the unfolding plots at Heart Lake, I don't think the novel ever convinced me I was involved or really even worried about the outcome. The symetry of three girls getting into trouble at the same private school twenty years apart is cleaver, but results in lots of repetition and constantly identical lake-scenery descriptions. The book fails to make you forget you're reading it. You never loose yourself, headlong, into the character of Jane, or any of the others. Jane is so busy explaining details, one never worries about her safety, especially at the end."
2,Lake of Toxic Writing Sludge,"The initial chapters of Carol Goodman's The Lake of Dead Languages inspired hope in me that there would be great things to come. In these first 50 or so pages, Goodman paints fascinating visual impressions, and introduces vulnerable, intelligent characters. Later though, I was deeply disappointed by what proved to be a contrived plot. I began to feel like I was wading not in a Lake, but through a garbage-strewn swamp. Discovering the implausible, jacked-up, cheaply rendered motivation behind the crimes was much like noticing an extra-big blob of bog slime sticking to my clothes. I've scrubbed off most of the scum, but I'll never forget the stench."
4,Four Stars,"I tore through The Lake of Dead Languages finishing it in three days. And I was unhappy when I finished it because there was not more to read. It's been a while since I've thought that.However, I felt the author telegraphed her intentions too much. It seemed as if she was trying to seed subtle clues throughout the novel but they were often quite apparent. One character in particular was like Checkov's gun - I just kept waiting until when she would go off.The various secret identities/birthrights are clearly meant to refer back to the classics, but they seemed a little soap-opera-ish.I liked this book for its language and imagery. They were original and evocative, but they didn't slow down the pace of the novel. They propelled the story forward."
2,Lake of Dead Plots!,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot ""twists"" were predictible and recycled from other books. The author uses characters' given names and Latin names interchangeably, and it's hard to figure out who's who. There are characters in this book for no reason. Like other reviewers, I thought the imagry of the lake's noises and blackness were well done, but way overdone--we get it already!I wouldn't waste my time or money with this book. I read it for a book club, and we were all very disappointed with it."
4,"A lake, a boarding school, teenage girls....","Well, that can only mean things will happen and that things has happened. The mysterious Heart Lake, close to a boarding school for teenage girls, is what everything circles around in this wonderful and dark story.From the first pages we learn, that Jane Hudson has returned to her old boarding school, now in a Latin teacher's position. We also quickly get the feeling that something dark and terrible happened when Jane herself was a student there. And that it had to do with the lake, a certain Latin teacher and Jane's friends.The language in the book flows easily, the chapters are never too long, most of the characters are interesting, the mystery very interesting (although not that hard to figure out, about half way into the book) and the looming presence of the lake is felt on all pages of the book.No, it is not sensational literature, but this book makes for a very good read, perfect for a lazy summer's day or a cosy winter day."
3,Uneven,"At times, the book was riveting and delicious. It stretches in directions that ordinary suspense novels fail to, and is written with a language skill not often seen in the genre.The author has a great sense of place, from the school to the town and the woods, to the acquadome, the settings are magnificent, if too heavily relied upon.While I can appreciate the mazey plot in retrospect, the many clues make obvious whodunnit quite early in the reading.There is one pleasant surprise to enjoy along with the main character."
5,A HAUNTING AND ENGAGING READ,This was my first introduction to Carol Goodman and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this novel. I read it in two days and was jumpy with anticipation nearly the entire time. I am looking forward to reading her other novels. I hope they are as good!
5,I really enjoyed this book,"Thankyou to Carol Goodman for this enchanting book, I could not put it down . I look forword to purchasing her other published work"
1,Not even close to The Secret History,"This is a crappy book with an exceedingly idiotic narrator and a plodding and obvious narrative structure. The comparison to The Secret History is thematic only, as Donna Tartt's work is infinitely stronger and more intelligent. Not worth your time"
3,Don't be fooled . . .,if you're buying this book because of comparisons to Donna Tartt . . . . don't -- you'll be disappointed.
1,only one good thing about this book,"the only good thing about this book is the title. very predictable ending and if the main character fell down one more time, i think i would have screamed. where was the editor for this book?"
4,Lake of Dead Languages,"I read this book in a book club and really enjoyed it. The plot was somewhat intense and very interesting. The character of the narrator was developed very well, and although the book is based on present events, the past events and characters were so well developed through the narrator's eyes it was easy to feel like you knew those characters, too."
5,Fun and Addictive Reading,I picked this book almost on a lark. I had beed stuck in a Chick Lit rut and hadn't read anything that I was addicted to or in a hurry to finish. I decided to look for a book with a female protagonist but in a story with a darker feel. I will admit that figuring out who is the bad one in this story is not hard. But that is not the part that intersted me. Carol Goodman lets out the secrets in this book with great timing. My jaw dropped at one point. I had to know what had happened when Jane (the protagonist) was a student at Heart Lake.I really enjoyed that I didn't fully understand what was going on with the past until Jane was ready to understand it herself. I liked the naieveness of young Jane just wanting to fit in with Lucy and her longing to be loved by Matt. Plus the Mystery Surrounding Domina Cambers is great too.A great read all around.
2,Too many words,"This book was far too long for its skimpy plot. It would have been much more compelling if it had been stripped down a bit. The characters were initially interesting, but as the book wore on and on (and on and on), their cookie cutter personalities were too thin to hold up the structure. Also, but setting this story in a relatively remote setting, the plot's secrets could be detected too soon."
3,Disappointing.....,"I was disapointed by this book. The reviews made it sound more interesting than it turned out to be. The claustrophobic girls' school environment was well drawn, but the dark, cold, indeed very chilly ambience wasn't warmed up by believable characters or a very interesting plot. Also, as has been noted by others, the book seemed derivative of ""The Secret History."" No fault of the author's, most likely, but she couldn't help but be aware of Tart's novel, which was so commercially successful and should have changed some aspects to differentiate her own work. How could she NOT think the books would be compared? Still, I'd say the writer has talent, and I hope she does better second time around."
4,I wish i had read it earlier,"Having been a student of the Author when this book was published I got to read the first chapter possibly before the book hit the stores. Since then I have carried the book litterally around the globe with the intent to read the remainder of the book. Unfortunately due to work and my tendancy to stay in my comfort zone for personal reading when I got the chance, it had been far too long. As I read this book I found myself pulled into the story and having to make myself put the book down in order to take care of my other responsibilities. My comfort zone has now been expanded and I look foreward to reading the remainder of Mrs. Goosmans books."
4,Strangely interesting.,"I'm not much of a reader, but there was no way I could not read this book. I found it on my windshield when I came out of a K-mart one day. I couldn't not read it, and I am glad I did. It is a kind of creepy story but it is very interesting and it has stuck with me since I read it. The imagery I get from the book is very vivid in my head."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this novel on the recommendation that it was like ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. Other than the fact that this is an academic mystery murder, it is nothing like Ms. Tartt's book. ""The Secret History"" is far superior in character development, plot and writing style."
5,A wonderful modern gothic novel.,Goodman doesn't miss a trick but executes each one in a creative and original manner. Plenty of twists and turns and surprises...some I saw coming but most I did not.
2,Morbid characters,"This novel is beautifully written. However, the girls and women are so morbidly obsessed and suicidal I didn't really care what had happened to them but I guessed correctly it would also be morbid and suicidal. There are pale gothic girls with suicide attempt scars. Pages of morbid obsession and guilt. Not much suspense because the pace and tone of the book is so relentlessly dark that dead babies or idiots putting themselves in danger on the ice or suicidal teachers, just seemed pretty much second verse, same as the first. A ""happy"" ending is tacked on and unconvincing. The misery, regret, and pervasive sense of doom are too relentless a force."
3,What a DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I was so excited to get this book; it was compared to Donna Tartt's ""The Secret History"" - one of my all time favourites. The closest I can come to drawing a comparison is to say it's a very poor ripoff! It's not the worst book I've ever read, but to compare it to ""The Secret History"" was a hige mistake. Donna Tartt's book took 10 years to research and write...this book is mildly entertaining...but by no means a masterpiece of literature."
3,A disappointment in the end,"I was truly excited to read this book after reading the comparisons to Donna Tartt's book. Maybe this comparison is what led me to expect too much from this novel.I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, though. The suspense plot was reprtitive and predictable (I figured out who the ""bad guy"" was 125 pages from the end) and the ""surprise ending"" was just plain silly. I also thought too many of the plot devices were too neatly wrapped up.I also found it difficult to identify with the flat main character and the pat way that devices were moved in and out of the story -- for example, I found the way that her daughter was so important to her and then was simply carted off to her father's mid- novel pretty unbelieveable.The writer was trying too hard to describe how it was rather than let the characters simply tell the story -- as another reviewer said, successful fiction should show, not tell."
2,Publisher should not have compared novel to Secret History,"Comparing this novel to a Secret History was probably a mistake, setting a level of comparison that this novel did not achieve.Setting and plot sequence construction are imaginative and interesting, but story is overly melodramatic, farfetched, and repetitive.Good fiction needs to show and not tell. Ending also predictable."
2,Latin Teacher Needs a Review,"This book is acceptable as a light, predictable mystery. The plot is familiar and the ending not at all a surprise. Jane Hudson, the main character, needs a more complex treatment in order to engage the reader's empathy. My primary irritation with this book was the author's occasional Latin errors (and there was also an English grammatical error). Although her quotations from Vergil were appropriate, she made occasional errors in Latin vocabulary and grammar. Surely a Vassar graduate and Latin major would proof her work more carefully!"
3,Satisfactory First Novel,"It was the title of this book that intrigued me into buying it. It didn't entirely play me false either. This is an interesting, well told, well written story. Unfortunately, it suffers from being way too long, containing characters who are both transparent and unsympathetic, and consisting of a mystery I'd solved well before the end. Nice to see a new author attempting the mystery genre, however, and I hope she writes another novel. I'd certainly buy it, but I think this time I'd wait for the paperback."
2,"Didn't like it, couldn't put it down","This book made me think of what they say about only being able to read a limited number of books in your lifetime: I was fully aware that I was squandering time I could have spent reading a better written book, and yet I couldn't put it down. The need to find out the truth behind the events of Jane Hudson's past was so compelling that I had to race to the end of the book -- despite all the glaring holes in the plot, the thoroughly predictable identity of the villain (which I figured out about a third of the way through), the confusing array of unsympathetic characters with multiple interchangeable names, and the sometimes repetitive writing. In the end, I kind of resented the novel for making me want to finish it despite all its shortcomings. Just like the lake in the novel, no matter how much I wanted to walk away, I couldn't bring myself to do so."
2,its cheap,"it will power a system ,but the actual wire in the package is not pure copper ,not the best to use ... and the 8 gauge wire is about the size of 12 gauge wire... im not speaking of the conductive wire and the insulation ... just the metal... you get what you pay for"
1,JUNK,"EVERYTIME YOU GO TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE CONNECTORS THE CONNECTORS JUST FALL APART , GO TO HOME DEPOT OR LOWES, YOULL GET BETTER STUFF FROM THERE ! JUNK . FROM . THE . TRUNK."
3,Its ok,That says it.It is OK the wire is kinda low grade and my be less than 8 Gauge but it does the job and all the stuff is there.I can recommend it on price point.If you want High quality ya have to pay for it.
4,Fair Price,"It's a fair price for this kit. Don't know if it is 8 or 10 gauge wire, it's well insulated wire and has worked fine with my system. All the connections were made simply, and have stayed in place without problem. wire alone is worth the price, Good deal for the kit."
1,junk audio kit,"they should not be able to sell this for what it is for.my factory stereo has bigger power wire,read all reviews and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
3,ok for the price,"I will agree with some of the other reviews the power wire it self is only 10-12 gauge wire with thicker installation. If you are trying to use 8 gauge wire for a 1000 watt amp(RMS or Peak)you don't need to be installing your own amp. 8 gauge is only good for around 300watts pushing it at 400watts. this is perfect for 100-150 watt amp, especially at $12. I bought this to put a low power 15"" sub in our family car just to have some low end, the amp is a small 100watt 2ch and this is perfect for that. so if your trying to get alot of SPL and power out of your car you can still find a cheap 4gauge it that will be what you need this is great for a small amp for the front speakers or a low power sub."
2,False Advertising,"I have no idea how this kit is passed off as 8 gauge. As other reviewers have noted, the 8 gauge wiring isn't even close to size. The power and speaker cables are useless. The fuse, RCA cable and gold connectors were all I used out of this kit. I ended up going to a local car audio shop and buying the ""real thing"" to finish the job."
1,1000 watt? Pyle sucks,When these other people said the guage on the power and ground was wrong I thought it would be no big deal but I was wrong. The guage is about as thick as some speaker wire. Its rediculous. Dont get this unless you a trying to power a 200watt amp.
2,RCA cables,RCA cable pin broke off in the input audio of my amp 4th day after I got it. Look out for that if you get this product. Other then that product is okay for my 1st car audio system.
3,It's just OK,It's definitively not 8 gauge wire. I'm not sure how they get away with calling it 8 gauge. It will be fine for lower wattage amplifiers and for the price you could still afford to buy thicker power wire and just use the other parts in the kit.
5,Wire installation kit,This wire kit was much better than I expected. This was a great buy I wish I could buy another one to have on hand but I'm not installing another system right now. But great kit and worth the money... Great investment...
1,Do not bye,this installation kit is not Pyle s best product this installation kit is actually like 14 ga and the speaker wire is more like 18 ga the only thing that's any good is the RCA jacks and the remote wire but that's about it this kit is worth more like 10 bucks because of the amount copper they actually put in this kit sorry Pyle but you need to work on this one a lot better anyone looking to bye this do not
2,La Divina Comedia,"Although there is no break in the sequence of page numbers from page 18 to page 19, this edition actually omits two cantos of Dante's poem: from the end of Canto V to the middle of Canto VII."
3,BEWARE- shortened edition,"This text is the shorter version, each canto is shorter than the original and they skip canto 6 7 and 8."
2,Glorified Boy Scout Manual,"About 2/3rd's of this book are contain material from the Boy Scout's Handbook. The rest, the killing tactics and whatnot, are so laughable they look like a psychotic 2nd grader came up with them. This was originally a $100 book, and I'm one of the suckers who bought it out of Soldier of Fortune magazine back in 1982. About the only thing in this book that I found of interest is how to use a car-jack as a jam-spreader to open a door (which is easier said than done). The Soldier's Handbook isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The only reason for buying it is if you can find a copy in Good Will for under $1."
5,Excellent,"This book is a fun and fascinating read. Craig Storti is truly in tune with the subtleties, pitfalls and opportunities of cross-cultural dialogue. The book does not have an academic or burdensome tone; rather, it is simple to read and understand. I found it quite enjoyable, attempting to figure out (like a riddle), from each small example of a cross-cultural interaction, WHAT the ""snags"" or miscommunications of each scenario were. I also liked that Mr. Storti divided the book into different settings: social, workplace and business. As a student of conflict analysis and resolution, I have found (and will continue to find) this book extremely useful in my present and future work and interactions; however, anyone, from any walk of life, study, or profession should really read this book, as it would be very useful in our increasingly multi-cultural society, and our world, which is getting smaller and smaller all the time."
5,Storti's dialogues fascinating,"I teach in a community college in a small town near the Mexican border and discovered in Storti's book insights that enabled me to avoid small cultural differences that can interfere with communication. My advanced composition class studies the topic of cross-cultural communication world wide, and Storti's book is one of the major resources I make available to them in the college library. The students are fascinated by this segment of the class and like Storti's dialogues a lot."
2,Definitely NOT a must-read,"This was one of the most disappointing Love Stories books I've read. I thought it was so dumb how the whole book dealt with that issue over the horoscope. I mean, I felt like screaming to Natalie ""Get over it!"" Borrow this from the library, but don't waste your money on it. Email me with questions or comments."
4,A great book for young adult romance readers,"This is a funny and romantic novel about Natalie, a horoscope junkie who lives by the stars. Eventhough she is attracted to Dean, Natalie is scared because he is (gasp!) a Gemini! Horrifying! Shocking! Still, it's hard for the reader not to like this ditzy, superstitious character and the charming story"
5,This book is hysterical!,"These crazy Felines are in love! The author has used a variety of feline couples and the personality differences of these kooky cats make for some fun reading! Definitely worth the read, too bad it's out of print."
1,This is the worst gift I ever received.,"This book was a gift. Someone must really hate me. It was the sickest thing I've ever read. The innuendoes are perverse. Very much fiction considering cats only get it on 3 hours a year. Definitely not for children. P.S. I am not a Puritan, it's just sick."
3,Antique Tractor Bible: The Complete Guide...,"This is a good all-around tractor book with a lot of historical tidbits about different makes of tractors. If you are interested in one particular brand/style etc..., this may not be the book for you. If you simply like tractors, and enjoy learning reading general information about antique tractors, then this is a good addition to your book collection. It offers information on a few interesting and not so typical tractor types."
2,Another case file written by detectives and journalists.,"The cover of this book caught my eye and the short description of what it was about enhanced my curiousity. Who was this awful man that had killed 6 people? I had never heard of him. The book reads like a police report mingled with a shoddy journalist's viewpoint. There are words that are improperly used such as ""chickenhawk"" and a general misgiving to the gay community as a whole. The book did not tell me anymore than what the cover told me."
4,Gritty and Real,"""Lost in Hollywood"" is a biography that was forced upon my by my little sister. She baulks that the thought that one of her dear siblings would have no idea who River Phoenix is. ( ! )So, I opened the cover with little admiration and little interest- however once I began to read, the pages fell away and I was lost in... er, Hollywood?The bio covers the short life of ""hearthrob"" River Phoenix (brother to Joaquin Phoenix- previously known as ""Leaf"") through his race to stardom and his struggle with drug addiction and the pressures of Hollywood.It was an inspiring novel (and life) and I owe it all to my little sister... er, and Mr John Glatt."
2,"In the fast attempt to cash in on death, errors fill the pag","I suppose when someone dies or is murdered, the number of books published immediately after their demise says something about the infamous nature of the case.This book ""Lost In Hollywood"" is one such case. For those of you who are not River Phoenix nutjobs, take it from one. :) This book is filled with errors. Please keep that in mind in your quest for knowledge.You're probably better off visiting ""Rio's Attic"" on the internet."
5,This thing is wonderful!,"I gave this kit a 5 star rating because I found it hard to find fault with it. I have been using background stands for several years, and this one was by far the easiest I've ever set up. It took less than 5 minutes to set it up. The telescoping horizontal pole is brilliant and easy for one person to use. It even comes with a roll of white seamless paper, which is perfect for high key shots for one or two people without fighting with wrinkles in cloth. The storage bag fits everything (except the paper roll) perfectly. Unless you need something more permanent for a studio, such as a wall mount, you really can't go wrong with this purchase. Very happy with it!"
2,There was a screw missing,"The standard arrived quickly. When I put it together to use, I discovered that one of the screws for locking the expandable legs was missing. An e-mail to the vendor resulted in no response. The legs can be made stable with duct tape (duct tape will fix anything) so the standard is useable, just not aesthetically pleasing."
5,"""You shouldn't have to say goodbye""shed me to tears","A thirteen year old girl without a mother? Sarah. Sarah knowing that her mom has cancer, puts herself to gymnastics to hide the reality. If I was Sarah, I would never live a normal life again."
1,first class baloney,"This book is not an interesting piece of literature. It is largely a collection of psychobabble and wind. Its main purpose should be to demonstrate, through the fact that it was published, that ""radical chic"" types will fall for anything. Too bad this guy took out his frustrations with ""the system"" by killing a waiter weeks after he was released. I guess that guy just didn't feel his pain."
1,Pathetic attempt at glorification,"Mr. Abbott's writing successfully manipulated many literati into helping him be released from prison, only to murder within a few days of release. His rationalizations are well-written, but now ring totally hollow."
2,Bitter to the Max,"Jack Abbott was a good writer whose flair for strong wording brought him to the attention of Norman Mailer and others. They got him out of prison because of the attention they gave him. But Abbott killed again after he got out of prison, and the state of New York put him back. He died from hanging in his cell--shoelaces and bedsheets it was. Whether he did it or the guards did it, no one knows for sure, but it was ruled a suicide. Abbott's consuming anger makes this book a hard read. I bought it, but that didn't mean I had to finish it. I didn't."
3,mediocrity at its best,"Poor ol' Jack was subsequently arrested for killing a waiter in a New York hotel after his brief success. He is a career criminal with severe problems. His work is largely based on his Marxist theory, although some insight is derived from the vicious mentality of those he lives with in prison. As an ex-con myself, I believe one must accept their true colours if they are to move beyond their current lifestyle. The book smacks of self-pity but also draws a sociological and psychological profile of recidivism and violence. Jack had it rough, but so did the victims and families. In all fairness, i have just completed a book myself and am probably not the best critic. Keep your eyes open for Turnstiles of Terror. Canadian prisons are just as evil as U.S. ones. Ispent 400 days in solitary myself and feel like a new man. How's that for black humor from down below? Take care folks."
2,The raving's of a lunatic!!!!,"I myself was in a level 5 maximum security prison in the United States and I can say while I did not always find conditions to my liking, I was being punished, isn't that the point? Jach Henry Abbot is a dilusional idiot who's many story's obviosly are grossly exagerated, if not at times completely made up. It was no surprize to me to learn that he killed a bus boy in a New York City restuarant two months after his hard won relaese."
3,Sad,"The sad thing about this book, is not only Jack H Abbott's life (if you can call it that), but the system which created him. How can a boy of 12 who is sent to prison, and then spends most of his life there, be expected to turn out any different. He is the product of a brutal part of our society which we would rather not talk about."
1,the rantings of a convicted murderer,The true injustice about this book is that it was released. Abbott makes some fine points about justice and lack thereof but he is as guilty as sin for his crimes but never apologizes. The book is full of his rantings about the injustices done to him but never once does he talk about the victims of his crimes. Did he ever write more after being re-arrested???
3,Murder and Intellectuals,"An ""intellectual"" according to Sartre, is one who ""mettles in a field outside one's area of expertise."" I have to believe that Abbott had read Genet and was aware of his relationship with Sartre. Abbott's area of expertise, in my opinion, was ""conning"" and ""manipulation"". When he takes on areas like foriegn affairs, for example, it is a purely intellectual exercise. Like all ""cons"", they are charismatic and I'm sure timing (Executioner's Song) had much to do with Mailer's adoration of Abbott, as well as his charisma. When you read Abbott's description of how it feels to kill someone, plunging a knife into flesh, we start to see the causal relationship between murder & intellectuals. The NY intellectual sect saw Abbott as an ""artist"", not a self professed murderer. The result was the death of a 22 yr. old boy and the sad ""My Return""."
2,an old resource...,"These vocab pictures are a resource in a pinch, but in dire need of an update... when was the last time you saw a rotary phone?"
1,junk,"I have a SportDog SBC10 that works well. I bought this product(SBC-18)and it is crap. The intensity/test switch will not stay at one setting, the dogs can change the setting during play. Most of the time I put the collar on at night and by morning the switch is on test and my dog is happily barking away.Don't buy this product."
3,OK,"Ok product, just didn't work for my dog and no matter what I did it left his neck irritated so I just stopped using it."
4,Good.,"Funciona, mi itención era evitar el exceso de ladrado en una raza que no se caracteriza por ello (rottweiler)... funcionó para mi..."
5,Get you hands on this one if you can!!,"Incredibly hot Victorian erotica!! If you have a thing for dominant women, this is the book for you! Deals with the typical victorian erotic elements in all their glory (young girls, incest, domination, decadence, etc.). The narrator, a girl of 15 or 16, is taught by her mother how to be sexually dominant with the men in her life... starting with her immediate family members. If you enjoy erotica and/or victorian style erotica, this books is about 70-80% one handed reading! Worth the trouble to find a copy IMHO"
4,Not a bad brush!,"It was cheap and it does the trick! The brush is very soft and easy to hold. I've only had it for a week or two, so I will have to wait and see how it holds up!"
1,Book Lacks Objectivity,"James Beller lacks objectivity is his work and cherry picks the information he chooses to present. I caution Baptists about reading this book because they will most likely love it, all the while unaware of its many inaccuracies. They will get a greatly distorted view of the role of the Baptists in American History. To be sure, much good information is present, but the author's interpretation of the information weakens the information's value."
5,2003 Disc of the Year!,"I'm an audiophile with a library approaching 1000 dics, that is a very diverse collection. BMRC's 2nd effort is an incredible disc! The band reminds me of R.E.M., back in their early days when they were actually a Rock N Roll band (pre-Out of Time).Their sounds vary from song to song, their lyrics cover a range of stories, and they play intensely on each piece.This disc is the best piece of art that I've bought this year. There has been a lot of disappointment in the Rock/Pop/Rap arena in the past year, but this disc prevents '03 from being a rather disappointing year in music.That being said, buy the disc, put it in your car, turn it up, and go for a long drive. You'll rock your brains out--the way you used to."
2,gravy,"this production would be great if someone else produced it. its like they wanted a soundbite on a friends cliffhanger but decided to buy leather pants and big sunglasses instead. nobody needs leather pants. all in all, its just kind of 'there'."
2,Muscular and Tedious,"Can a band be both muscular and tedious? There is evidence in the affirmative with Black Rebel Motorcycle's sophomore effort Take Them On, On Your Own. This CD was released in September. Though I've listened to it many times since then, I can hardly recall what song is on when it's playing, what any of them are about, or any details from track to track. Aside from the fiery single ""Stop"" and the sensually gothic ""In Like the Rose"", I return to it for the sound - a post-Jesus and Mary Chain roar that they explored to greater effect on their eponymous debut. Let's hope the J&M Chain analysis is fleeting - as well all know, they never bettered their debut either."
2,too average,"While their first self-titled album was something quite exciting to listen to, the guys' Take Them On, On Your Own sounds dull and monotonous, almost entirely devoid of any flashy numbers. The album rather smacks of those other mass-produced ""alternative"" mediocrities which dominate our rock scene these days. I hope it wasn't the U.S. Government that kept the guys down from doing better."
3,"It's not bad, and certainly listenable","But it's like ""Definitely Maybe"" crossed with, uh, ""Definitely Maybe"" . . ."
5,New BRMC We've Been Waiting to Hear!!,"An excellent follow-up to the original. Without a doubt, BRMC is taking them on, on their own terms! The album kicks off with the rocking STOP and takes you through a plethora of BRMC fuzzy guitar tunes. I enjoyed the unique HA HA HIGH BABE. An outstanding collection right through the entire album to include the HEART & SOUL ending.TAKE THEM ON, ON YOUR OWN, will be a staple in my CD player for some time to come.Excellent, simply excellent."
4,BRMC's Excellent Follow Up,"The follow-up 'Take Them On, On Your Own' basically sounds like the BRMC's debut CD Part 2, perhaps with a little more rock, with a little more swagger. Sometimes not changing your musical formula isn't such a bad thing, especially if a bands previous album was strong. You can still hear that Jesus And Mary Chain influence, yet at the sametime they're kinda shifting towards more high-energy rock. People have always described BRMC's sound in fancy colorful terms, Neo Psychadelic, Noise Pop, distortion with fuzzbox vocals, etc. But if you look past all of that, it's basically rock and roll. Just like the debut, the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club still has that dark ominous swagger, but just might rock a little harder this time around."
2,one trick pony,"They've become a parody of themselves, complete with black and white ""mean guy"" photos. One trick ponys."
4,Im in love with something that I cant see...,"When I first listened to BRMC's song ""We're All In Love"",I fell in love with it instantly.I immediately bought their album ""Take Them,On Your Own Own"" which turned out to be pretty cool.These guys make good music.However not all the songs in the album are worth listening to.The songs seem to deteriorate towards the end of the album.Overall,it's not a bad album,its pretty good if you skip some of the bad tracks.My ratings for each song:""Stop"" 7/10""Six Barrel Shotgun"" 9/10""We're All in Love"" 10/10 (my all time favorite)""In Like The Rose"" 10/10""ha Ha Highbabe"" 9/10""My Generation"" 9/10""Shade of Blue"" 10/10""US Government"" 9/10 (Love the way the song ends)""And i'm Aching"" 7/10""Suddenly"" 6/10""Rise or fall"" 7/10""Heart and Soul"" 6/10"
3,A slight slip.,"The second album by BMRC ""Take Them On, On Your Own"" #47, is a slight slip from their debut. They continue to rock with their shoegazing best, but the material is just a tad weaker. You have the blistering ""Six Barrel Shotgun"", the hypnotic ""Shade Of Blue"", ""(Kill The) US Government"" and ""Rise And Fall"". Robert (Been) Turner and the band would release their masterpiece next on ""Howl""."
3,3.5 Stars Really,"This is my first experience with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, alas, I cannot compare this album with their first effort. However, the more I listen to them, the more I like them. I bought the album solely based on my addiction to ""In Like The Rose"" after hearing it on live365.com and while there are songs I have the tendency to skip, there are some I can listen to on repeat constantly.For starters, ""Stop"" is an excellent intro for this cd. It's doesn't waste time building you up, but almost goes straight for the jugular. The other highlights for me included ""Shade Of Blue,"" ""And I'm Aching"" and ""We're All In Love."" My absolute favorite song though is ""In Like The Rose."" The song I'm not too crazy about however is ""Generation.""I don't know if I would recommend this for first time B.R.M.C. listeners. While it isn't a classic in my book, there are strong points to it that keep me coming back."
4,GET THIS CD OR REGRET IT FOREVER,"Another amazing album from these San Francisco rockers. Just all around good stuff--dark but not too dark. Poppy in just the right places. Decent production, and not overdone. Seeing them live is the best way to experience them--hopefully a live EP or something will follow this album.Do yourself a favor and pick this album up. Get The Warlocks' albums as well. They're opening for them and are not to be missed!"
4,Old music but with a new spirit,"Beautiful melodies, some efficient rhythms, diverse sources of inspiration and no boring track. What can you ask more? Don't ask them to be Bowie, they are only in the beginning of their journey."
2,repetitive information is presented in the book,"I have covered the book completely, and I have found that the information presented in the chapters is quite repetitive in contents. Even within each chapters there are lots of repetition of information.The book can be presented with half the chapters and pages currently contained in it.Therefore, the reading of the book was very tedious and tiresome."
1,"Poor structure, layout and uninteresting","The book references numerous sources for seemingly no reason, and constantly repeats what a qualities a good IT manager must have. It is a huge challenge to gain anything of value from the book."
2,Not reader friendly.,It is not reader friendly. Has no ilustrations or tables. Does not invite to read it.
1,Breaks windows ~ Doesn't work on Linux,It worked great for the first 6 months. Then due to the driver it installed I started getting some Blue Screens of Death. This was all the Windows I could take and I finally installed Linux. Then I discover this adapter does not work with Linux. It is so Windows dependent that there are no (that I know of) wrappers that will make it work.So.. don't buy this.
5,best adapter yet,i have had this adapter for over 2 years and i am about a football field and a half away from the router and going through brick walls this little thing has been the best i have seen it holds its own at the distance i am still getting anywhere from half to full signal strength on it i think some of thes cry babys here just dont know what they are doing when it comes to useing this adapter because all these problems they are talking about have not happened to me even once matter of fact i am useing it right now and it has full powere best bang for you buck
3,This product seems to be listed incorrectly,Both the description and model number (sbg900) for this correspond to the Motorola Surfboard. The price and name are for some type of adapter.
5,Plug -n- Play,"This device saved me from further worry and troubles. We recently set up an outdoor wireless network using Hawking Technology equipment. I love their antennas and routers, but I could not get their PCI cards to work with my computer. I struggled for a couple of days going through two PCI cards and a wireless bridge with no luck. I bought Motorola's adapter at Wal-Mart, installed the drivers, and plugged it in. After about 10 seconds there was no response and I thought I was stuck again. All of the sudden my computer connects to the network automatically. I was very happy! That's why I'm here to buy two more for other computers on our network."
1,Crashes often,"Been running 4 computers (windows XP, linux, and mac osX) on a wireless network with a D-Link router for the better part of a year with no problems - until I added this little ""gem"" to the mix. With this adapter running on another machine (Windows XP), not only does the network adapter itself crash seemingly randomly on the machine itself, it also appears to somehow crash the router itself, taking the entire wireless network off the air completely.Looks like I'll be looking for something else to replace this with, as unplugging/replugging power cables on both this adapter and the router is quickly getting old."
1,"STOP ERROR, Blue screen of deth.","I'm using this adapter on Dell Inspiron 5160, P4, 2.8GHz, 1GB of RAM, Windows XP SP2. It works fine until I do some network activity. As soon as you do some download you will get blue screen STOP ERROR and computer creased.I did try this device with SP 3and got same result. I format the hard disk and reinstall entire Windows XP but this adapter gives same error even on freshly installed windows XP."
1,Terrible ....don't waste your time,"There is a known issue with this router that Motorola has not spent any time fixing. It will crash your computer if you are running XP or Media Edition. The failure is the blue screen of death stating the wind502u error. This is the driver for the adapter.Look somewhere else for a nice adapter, don't be fooled by the looks or price of this Motorola adapter."
1,Blue screen of death,"I'm using this device with Windows XP Media Center Edition v2002, SP2 on a HP Pavilion P4, 3GHz, 1GB of RAM.I get the bluescreen when connecting to another PC on my network and attempting to transfer files. Needless to say this thing is not reliable.I believe the USB design is flawed, I'm going to switch to the PCI model."
2,buyer beware,"My seven year old was so excited to play with it. He followed the directions carefully, and within 30 min. the gun was broken. Very dissapointed with the quality of the merchandise. The rapid fire no longer rapidly fired or fired at all! Had to return it and deal with his dissapointment."
3,Comical,"Ok, this blaster looks cool, right? Well, don't be fooled. This blaster is not really any good at all. It doesn't really shoot fast at all, requires around 50 pumps to work, and you never really know where to put the darts if you can't load all twenty of them while you're crouched behind cover. The single shot mode loses more air, fires less rapidly, and is just as unimpressive as the rapidfire mode. Also, the handle is, like all blasters, very brittle, and will snap with the slightest touch. Don't buy this gun. Instead get the PowerClip, or the BlastFire DX|500, that is, if you're looking for a rapidfire weapon. The only part of this gun I like is its range, trigger shield, and no-air-leak."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,if you are wondering why i put everything 1 star its because mine only lasted 2DAYS!!when on the second day i used it i tried shoot it but it jammed buy a n-strike this SUCKS!!
4,Too much fun!,"Inherently you run out of ammo gaming around with your kids with the 5 shooters, but with 20, ho ho ho! we get some really gaming going on! I plan to pick a few more of these since my son has the advantage again his other 3 siblings and myself when he has this fun weapon. Therefore, we have to even to odds, since he can unload in about 2 seconds. I wish the Nerf ammo wer a lot cheaper, and I plan to rig some kind of quick loader for this gun as well. my kids are 1 3 5 7 and I'm 29. I love it!Issues: Once the plastic hosing ""plumbing"" inside burst when I overpumped the tank, but it was easy to repair and I've since replaced all the hoses inside to allow for a better responce.I still give it 4 stars"
4,fully auto,"Over all this is a good gun besides a long priming session. It would be cool if this gun could be battery powered like the motorized ballzooka and had an ammo belt or chain that could be fed into the weapon. I like the very fast rate of fire of this gun as well as the compact size. The loudness of the rotating barrel also gives the weapon an empowering and more realistic feel. The 20 darts would be better if replaced by whistling darts in my opinion. this is definately a weapon of choice for troopers very close to the enemy. I have found that the rapid fire works best if used in teams of 2 or 3, so that 1 teamate could fire and hold off the enemy while the other dropped back & reloaded."
5,A great little Nerf machine gun!,Length:: 0:26 MinsI timed this in the video window of Quicktime. I didn't speed it up at all. This shoots so fast you need to plan your target area or you'll lose darts! It is a blast to use every time. Don't shoot at your cat! (If you can help it. At least point away from the head!)
2,okay i guess maybe it's just my rapid fire,"I'm not sure but i bought this(WITH MY OWN MONEY!!!!!!!) at FAO Shwarts. It was so much fun for the first hour. THen something unthinkable happened. BRKAAAA. It broke. I pumped it as fast as i could then shot but nothing happened. Not just that but even if it didn't break i couldn't hold it for a long time because it's like 2 feet long and i was only like 9 so..... you get the point. But anyway this gun is probably great for all the kids who are around 8-17. You can buy it, but your risking it because each one costs around $34 and the gun might break.... but thats up to you. Happy Thanksgiving!"
3,Wasn't what I expected for $60...,"It is definitely a fun toy, that's for sure! However, it feels like it would be extremely easy to break. It's also really hard to pump, and you have to pump it about 30 times for it to release the full round. This is not a good toy for young kids because it would be difficult to pump and it seems easy to break the pump. The best part is the awesome noise when you release the round, and the fact that in a Nerf war you would definitely win. I wouldn't recommend this toy, simply because it was so expensive and the quality is not that good."
5,A great gun to back up snipers,"So all of you out there that snipe, you probobly all have the same proboblem- to low rof (rate of fire) this is the awnser!!!!!!!!! and for all of you who have a problem of getting darts, MAKE YOUR OWN! the gun must have the pegs in the barrels ripped out, and the way to make the darts is simple: first go to home depot and buy some foam backer rod, and hot glus sticks. then cut the foam into 1 1/2 inch pieces. then make a cone shape in 1 end by puching the hot glut gun's head into the foam, and fill it with glue. let it dry, and you have about 150 darts for around $7.50!!!well, see-ya!kaiman299"
5,Amazing!,"This is the best nerf gun ever made! it has two fire modes, rapid and single. it is very powerful and shoots darts about 30 feet. the only things are that the pump is very skinny and can break off very eaisily. you also have to keep reloading, which takes a long time. so...Positive+ Very fun+ lots of power+ two modes are useful+ very fun and good for your moneyNegative- pump breaks eaisily- takes a long time to reload"
5,Its a love it or love it gun,"I opened it as soon as i got home from toyrus and I must admit that it was money well spent!(well, I used a gift card, hehe)Not only does it have educational Gatling gun technology by having a visible air tank and launching mechanism (you can see it move fast when firing, talk about AWESOME) but it is fun as h***. When I fired in rapid fire it made loud (kind of annoying)real machine gun noises. Do not listen to other people who broke their gun. They were stupid and either over-pumped it (2-3 pumps is good for basic distance, more for long distance)or were so rough they busted the air tank. The only con about this gun is that you finish your ammunition very quickly and it takes FOREVER to reload.Lastly, dont modify any nerf guns, I tried that with a nerf ""ratchet blast"" about 3 yrs ago and my gun broke.If you mod it and it breaks they DONT give you a refund, so DONT MODIFY NERF GUNS. Sorry, I went off topic, Hehe. Bye, Bye!"
1,Everything could have been said in less than one page.,Very redundant. Nothing said that was not already common sense. Very disappointed.
2,A bit misleading for older infants...,"In my read-through of Ms. Hussin's book, I can see how implementing her techniques of sleep separation, etc could be useful in getting a newborn quickly accustomed to sleeping independently. However, the title and summary passage make it seem like hers is a method that can be painlessly applied to older infants as well. Unfortunately, when you get to the chapter on older children, her plan devolves into straight forward Ferber, along the lines of ""you must come to terms with the fact that your child will cry, but this won't make you a bad parent..."". While this may be true for many of us who have waited until our children are a few months old before tackling their sleep habits (or lack thereof), the book's title leads you down a rosy path before dropping the harsh truth at your feet."
5,Loved this book,"As a new mom, I have been inundated with volumes of information. I thought I was totally prepared, but didn't really think about how I was going to get my baby sleeping through the night. I was so worried about everything else that I forgot to think about one of the most important aspects about having a new baby. I stumbled upon this book just surfing the web for answers and I am SO happy that I found it. In less than two weeks, my little eight week old was sleeping through the night and falling asleep on his own."
5,These are great...but will they include everything,"It's quite exciting to have all of Barbra's early TV work out on DVD. The shows will be great. I'm wondering, though, if anyone ever thought about release THE ENTIRE Happening in Central Park. The show ran 2-1/2 hours for those lucky enough to be in Central Park that night. Yet the album had what, 40 minutes of material and the hour long TV special included probably about 50 minutes. Where's the rest of the footage and the rest of the songs?How about a double CD of a great early concert by the younger Streisand? And how about the full-on DVD of the entire show. You know they shot it all. You know the footage is in the vaults. Come on Barbra, come on Marty...release it already. Give your fans a real treat!"
5,At Last!!!!,"I have always maintined the concept that ""everything eventually lands on DVD"" So when I found out that the Streisand Specials were finally being released on DVD, I was thrilled. After all, the rumors started circulating about 5 years ago. One thing is certain: YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!! I originally bought the specials (in BETA format!!) when they were released almost twenty years ago and what I realized at that time is that I had an opportunity to visually witness greatness in it's infancy stages. Ms. Streisand and her creative team explored new territory in television history. For those of you who are not long-term fans, I urge you to not only purchase and view the shows, but go back, do the research and discover what it took to get these landmark shows on the air!!!"
4,"Good, but Not Perfect","I had never seen any of these TV specials before I bought the DVD set and I have been very pleased after watching each of them, but they are more a product of their time than I realized.The sound quality is not always the greatest and I am sure that has much to do with television production in the 1960s. The picture quality exceeded my expectations. I can't imagine what middle America thought when these were first aired. They are definitely innovative but sometimes border on bizarre . . . a far cry from other television specials of the period. Barbra is an amazing talent and her voice is like no other. She had confidence in her abilities to be sure, with no humility whatsoever."
3,Finally Here but at a Rip Off Price,"With virtually no extras, we get five 50 minute TV shows, one to a disc. Five discs merely inflates the price (not to mention shelf real estate) when you consider that all five discs could easily fit on two discs max. No doubt about the quality of the content but a five disc release is ultimately a rip off."
1,GARBAGE,JUST more garbage from Streisand repackaging material released on several other DVDs and CDs. Quality also poor. Save your money.You might try the Boz Scaggs DVD which is really good.
4,Barbra A Special Lady!!,"I really give this 4 1\2 stars!!! These specials are very good and the remastering is fantastic! Now the jokes in some of them are dated..but hey you can live with that and enjoy the music...now the only special that doesn't hold up is the THE BELLE of 14TH STREET, (that is why 4 stars was given,the third act of this special is good). Barbra is one GREAT singer and these specials show what a unique performer she is!"
3,Barbra...And Other Musical Instruments WTF!,"I had always wondered why ""Barbra...And Other Musical Instruments"" was never released and now I understand. That special is nauseating! I've never seen such scary production!"
1,Dreary prairie,"1 1/2Veering closely towards wake-and-bake demo recordings, rarely does this low lo-fi exploit numbingly repetitious posturing properly."
3,Good Resource,"I've been hiking this area since 1983. My bible for the Sandias is Mike Hill's ""Hikers & Climbers Guide to the Sandias"". However, the last edition is well out of date and I supplement with this book. When I decide it is time to explore a new area of the Sandias in depth, I take out both books and the maps provided therewith, set my GPS and make notes about terrain and when I have the time I'm off. Now if someone could just write one book that combines all this information, I'll be in hiker heaven!"
3,Counting By Fives the Yummy Way!,This is a cute book that teaches the concept of counting byfives through a hands-on approach using Reese's Pieces Candy. Countingfrom 5-100 is done by using a visual and words to teach the concept. An automobile and candy is seen on each page. The automobiles move the candies by fives until they move all one hundred. The reader sees the number symbol and the number name at the top of each page. This is a cute book that could be used to introduce or review counting by fives.
4,"Has anyone heard the Trance remix of ""Harry's Game?""","While I must say this CD is wonderful it still doesn't compare to Trance music. Chicane's remix of ""Harry's Game"" has become a classic trance song. It's not just a great song to dance to, but it's also, like any regular Clannad song, a great sond to listen to on its own. I recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to Clannad or Irish, Celtic or New Age music. Just search for Chicane or Best Trance Anthems Ever and give it a try."
1,Don't buy this book.,"The author, Matt Buschbacher, is known to have recently engaged in neo-Nazi activities.If you're interested in the subject, buy another book by a different author. Don't put money in this guy's pocket, to spend on his hate stuff."
1,Absolutely unpractical 'fatherly' advice,"I got this book after reading all the rave reviews. But frankly I find this book to be a big let down. It starts off very nicely with the first chapter, but thereafter Mr. Lott runs out of ideas. He keeps on repeating the old adage, if you fail once, try again. His phrases like, ""let love blossom"" and asking you to be patient while doing so....is highly fatherly to say the least.He places the girl on a high pedestal and contiunes to say that if you were to go on doing nice things for her, she is bound to respond sooner or later. As we guys all know, this hardly ever happens in real life. The girl is more likely to get bored and look elsewhere.Reading on, trying to get something worthwhile, led to further frustration. [...]"
2,Not worth it!!!!,This book is a very basic guide to picking up woman. It feels like something a friend would tell me with very little experience in picking up woman. I have read many PUA books and study tons of material from the different PUAs [...]. It has no real psychology behind the way a woman thinks and uses no real examples of situations that you might run into on your journey to being a PUA. Meeting woman has a very basic approach to it that just about every ladies man should know and this book doesn't not even come close to hitting the mark. [...]. I know most guy don't want to be Mystery but come on at least his concept is good you just have to tweak it a little to make it work for you. Biggest thing in meeting woman is just doing approach after approach and keep pushing the envelope for the most beautiful woman. Also a good opinion opener!!! [...].
5,Great Book,This book was very informative. Bob Lott does a great job in reminding us that being a gentleman can help in meeting a beautiful woman. They're were many useful tips I have already started using.
5,great book for the average guy,"This is a great book for the average guy who wants to meet and date a beautiful woman. This book is easily worth ten times the asking price. Bob Lott has a complete seminar for the average guy on how to win over a beautiful woman. Guys there is hope for you after reading and following the advice in this book. The social ice breaker is worth the price of the entire book. Woman want a man who is unique and you will be unique using the social ice breaker. Get this book, you will not be disappointed"
4,powder styptic,"If you groom your own dogs, this a must to have on hand! The price of it is also within your budget!"
5,Full of practical suggestions,"I recently went to a talk with the author and it was incredible. She gave so many practical suggestions on how to spare our kids from the fate of obsession with material things. By following even a few of these, I can help my kids build a happy, contented adulthood. I have to admit to not having read this book, yet, but it's next on my list."
2,OOOPS!,"A stainless steel pet dish sounds like a good idea. It should be fine for food or water, clean easily, and always look nice.The above may be true - problem is it tips easily. If you have an over eager dog or cat or just a lovable but clumsy one you'll find yourself with a few spills.It would have made sense to weight the bottom. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out."
4,Great book.,Love this trilogy. Plenty of chemistry between Clare and Tony.This is my favorite story line from Miller. I've read it a least four times.
5,My favorite of the trilogy,This 2nd book of the trilogy is my favorite of all LLM books. The suspense was better in this one as to who was doing it and why. It is one I could read again and again.
3,"Sequel to ""Don't Look Now""","A hungry attraction. A hidden enemy.A multimillion dollar inheritance from the father she never knew has allowed Clare Westbrook to turn a storefront in a tough Phoenix neighborhood into the legal firm of her dreams. But when explosive shots take out her street-level windows--and nearly take her life--Clare must surrender to Tony Sonterra's protection if she wants to survive....Sonterra has designs on a career move to the FBI--and on rekindling his scorching, no-strings-attached affair with Clare. But can the man who sparks her passion be trusted with her life? Or is someone using Clare, the one person Tony has dared to get close to, to get to him?"
4,Never a Let Down,"I actually went searching for these book. Linda Lael Miller has never let me down, not with the historicals and not with the contemporary. Besides, Tony Santerra is too hot for me not to know what happened with them."
5,Sassy Girl,"This book was GREAT ! I could not put it down. It's the 2nd book in Miller's series and this book absorbs you into the the characters. The storyline was good, but Miller's writing style is what totally keeps me interested. Very witty !!!"
5,Miller,"She does a great job with her characters, and have many of her books, this one was really interestingm would like to have the other two"
5,"Finally, a book I like","As a reader of Mr. Koontz novels of 20+ books, I can absolutely say this was one of those I will be reading again.It isn't one of those cheesy books with a little bit of murder, a little bit of danger, a little bit of boy-with-a-psychopathic/tragic past...this book has depth, real characters I care and cried over and just overall...it is a book for those who like a bit more than cardboard cut-out characters you don't really have to think about.Voice of the Night is very entertaining all the way through, and it even lacks those ""Dean Koontz Moments"" as I call them where nothing happens for long periods of time. Tightly written, well paced, scary, GOLD STARS ALL AROUND!"
1,Not so good,"I usually enjoy Dan Koontz books, but I ended up putting this one down. Not crazy about the dialog, just wasn't able to get into the book. Keep in mind that I did not finish the book, perhaps it got better farther along."
5,"A Good, Fast Paced Thriller","Two fourteen year old boys, Colin & Roy. Colin is shy, an introvert, and easily scared. He becomes blood brothers with Roy. Roy is the opposite. Extroverted, a ladies' man, everyone likes him. Oh, he is psychotic as well.Best friends until Colin quickly finds out how deeply troubled & murderous Roy is. Colin's mom is a bit too busy for him & disbelieving of his stories of Roy.The novel wends it's way into how Roy became the way he is and how he's eventually stopped.The story does reflect on real life in some cases. The plot is simple & Mr. Koontz, leaving his supernatural world behind, turns a simple plot into a very good novel"
5,"And the Voice said, ""Read This, It's a Real Popper!""","Colin is your typical small town American kid. His friend Roy is not. One day they have a conservation. ""You ever killed anything?"" Roy asked. From this moment Colin's childhood innocence comes to end and he has to grow up real fast or die.This is a sensational thriller, following Colin's moral dilemmas of being dragged into a world of evil thoughts of rape and murder he doesn't want to be a part of. Can Colin escape this world? Can he do so alive?This is one of Koontz's best novels. Koontz takes you right into the thoughts of Colin and Roy's minds so much so that you think you know them intimately. Read this book, as Roy would say. ""It's a real popper!"""
3,My opinion of this piece of literature and the characters.,"""The Voice of the Night"" is a very quick read with interesting characters and exciting plot twists. Throughout the story I was interested in what would happen next. I think that this story is geared toward a teenage audience, but it can still be interesting to adult with creative imageneering. Roy is a kid with mental problems who seems to be normal in every way. He is a football player and popular. However his past is filled with dark secrets of murder. Colin is an outcast looking for the first real friend of his life. He is a sweet and innocent kid that has to become vile to fight back and survive. The two of them get into a battle of popularity and inteligence because of one faithful and exciting event."
3,very fast,"This book takes about 2 days to read. Its fast paced, mostly because its 80% diologue, which is a big contrast to some of his other books like Fear Nothing or The Taking which is near constant narrative. Its entertaining but not heart pounding. Think ""The Good Son""."
4,"This was early Koontz, EXCELLENT coming of age...","story about two boys. This reminded me of ""Stand By Me"" and ""Boys Life."" It was a very good story about two young boys and a murder!!This was early Koontz and showed what he could do with young characters. The plot is good, flows smoothly at times, characters ar good, and is a nice read. It can be finished in a couple sittings!Koontz shows depth with the youngsters and this is an enjoyable read!"
4,Impressive writing,This was the first Dean Koontz book I have ever read. I had never heard of Koontz until I saw this book. It had a very interesting and detailed plot. I enjoyed every minute of reading it. It made me want to read more Koontz books and I enjoy them as well. I recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.
3,Geared towards teenagers,Great book that I read all in one sitting while flying from LAX to Manilla. There is something about Dean Koontz's books that is darkly appealing to me I guess.
1,Disgusting...,"I found this book very offensive from the get-go and I am such a fan of Dean Koontz, so this was a major disappointment. Maybe if he would've layed off the animal torture at the beginning just a tad..."
4,Two Teenagers causing trouble? Oh yes!,"A good solid Dean Koontz novel! A bit different from his usual fare often loaded with too many characters and a hard to follow plot. This book is very simple, very straight-forward and not twisted sci-fi at the end. The story simply follows two boy (around 13 or 14) set in the 80's. The book looked at their relationship and the trouble that young boys can get into. As it developed, we learned one of the boys likes to cause ""big trouble"". Let's just say that towards the end we learn the history and why he was a trouble maker. Some good action towards the end. If you like Koontz, this is a good one. I do recommend it."
3,Pretty decent,"This ended up being a pretty decent book in the end, though the title is misleading. The action is kind of far fetched but it's a good story and quick to read. And whoever that nerd is that reviewed this story down below that says that he reads ""merely 400 pages an hour"", yeah right,,,"
4,You too can read this book very quickly,"This book is quite a page-turner. It has an interesting plot, and you do feel nauseous now and again. Koontz is extremely good at describing moods and feelings of the characters in the novel. This is why I always enjoy his books. But I think that the climax (although it is interesting) seems a bit too obvious. It is a little to simple, and thereby sterile. I could not help thinking that Koontz suddenly got tired of writing and decided to finish it a.s.a.p. It was OK though, but far from his best novel."
5,Perfection,"A real page turner. I read this book in one night. Koontz writes with a profound understanding of the world in which we live. I highly recommend this novel. Koontz is one of the best horror fiction writers on the market. An excellent addition to any horror fan's library, next to Stephen King and Ramsay Campbell"
2,First Koontz book I didn't like,I have close to thirty books by Dean Koontz. This is the first one I didn't like. I got to page 104 and couldn't see any reason to read further.
2,This book was a bore.,"My opinion about this book is that it took to long to get to the point the book was based on. The first half of the book tells you about characters and different settings,and the buildup to the plot of the book. The book itself doesn't have enough action in the first half of the book to keep the readers attention. I think the author needs to fill his pages with more mystery or action. instead of taking half a book to build up plot,write the whole book on one. To me this book wasn't the best of books,and was too drawn out on the fact that it takes the author the first half of the book to talk about what will happen at the end. I think this book was boring."
2,Not very entertaining,This book was rather dull and too quick of a read. One of my least favorite Dean Koontz book for sure.
2,Silence the Voice,"Let me begin by saying that in general, I like the literary work of Dean Koontz. However, this particular story is short on action and long on describing in excruciating detail the various character's feelings and thoughts. Before you assume that I only like books with pictures in them, let me clarify that in general the descriptions of the main characters thoughts are salient to moving the story forward. However, as with salt, a little enhances the flavor and a lot destroys the taste buds. This is a case of too much salt. So much to the point of destroying my interest and rendering me hopelessly bored. I became bogged down in the inertia of the infinitesimal detail of each characters' every thought and their over analysis of their feelings which they took turns in sharing with the hapless reader. I actually lost empathy with the characters' peril and started to wish that the evil supernatural entity would dispatch with them quickly and yes, painfully."
4,It's a good read.,"My only disappointment is the story is a standard story. He must have written it before he started writing odd stories. What I expect from a Koontz novel is for it to start out like a normal suspense novel and then to gradually spiral into utter weirdness. Well, this novel lacks that.If you read this book expecting a good story that doesn't spiral into Koontz oddness, then you should enjoy it. It is a page turner."
4,a good read,"I found this book easy to read and entertaining. It's not one of his most complex books, but is still a worthwhile read. The book did not totaly absorb me but it also did not bore me. The story was another good guy versus bad guy, with colin being the nerdy hero and roy the deranged killer. Throughout most of the story you are willing colin on, but you are ultimately left feeling sorry for roy and how he came about to be so deranged. Personally i prefer koontz's more recent books, but this a a good early book."
5,LOTS OF SUSPENCE AND PRETTY SCARY TOO!!,the second koontz book i have read and its my favorite so far!!! the way he writes this book is so real that you feel that you actully know these characters and roy's thoughts are scary!!
5,Awesome work Mr Koontz,This book is very well written. The plot and setting are all excellent. The characters interacted very well. I couldn't stop before finishing it. It was filled with suspense. The ending was what it needed. If you are a thriller fan or a Dean Koontz fan stop wasting time and go read it.
1,Terrible Voice Acting/Mediocre Story....,"I found the audio book version on mega sale so I figured I'd throw it on my ipod. The voice actor is hard to take at times, and the story isn't that great either. Why can't they just hire a couple of young actors to voice the two main characters? I don't know how this guy decided what the main characters would sound like, but I doubt he wanted to come off as sounding this annoying! EH! Yuck! AWFUL!"
1,not well written,"This is the kind of book that makes me doubt that it takes any talent to become a novelist aside from a general ability to compose a sentence and outline a plot. I don't care. I'm tired of pretending every successful writer can actually write. This book was contrived, forced, the dialogue rang completely untrue. The things Koontz seemed to want us to feel or think about the characters we didn't naturally feel or think about them. I found myself disagreeing with every ""assessment"" the narrator made regarding the characters. I don't have anything against Koontz, he can set up a sort of suspenseful pace that makes you keep reading, but aside from that I felt this book was badly written and showed a marked ignorance about how human beings act, talk, think..."
1,Very disturbing,I am a great fan of Dean Koontz but I could not get past the first chapter of this book because of the graphic description of Roy's killing of animals. Too many off balance folks are motivated by this stuff. Dean can do better.
4,"Great book, a legacy for America, however there is an error.","I read the book ""Ellis Island Interviews: In Their Own Words"" with great interest and enjoyment. I commend the author, Peter Coan, for his research and this documented legacy of our American history.I am compelled to point out a significant error in the book's organization, however. The interview with Carla Martinelli, page 63 of the 1997 edition, is incorrectly assigned to Northern Italy. Since it is clear that Ms. Martinelli emigrated from Potenza, she should instead be categorized as a Southern Italy immigrant. Potenza is located in Basilicata region, the ""ankle"" of the boot of Italy. There is no way Potenza could ever be construed as anything but Southern Italy.I hope this book is published many times over in future years because it captures an important part of our nation's history. Again, I commend the author for putting this together when he did or otherwise these narratives would have been lost forever."
5,Ellis Island Interviews,I was intrigued by this book and decided to buy it because the community orchestra in which I play just performed Peter Boyle's Ellis Island: The Dream of America. These written accounts are so moving and helped me more fully appreciate the greatness of our country and what it offers to those seeking a new and better life in America. It's a great book to have on a coffee table for a conversation piece!
3,Cougar Hunting,"A cheesy teen sex comedy that would of been better if it was straight to DVD, but they had to release it into the theaters. So, I saw this movie in the theater. It wasn't terrible but it's not that great. It's a movie that you watch on Netflix Instant. And there is a couple of ""ewww"" and ""ugh"" scenes."
4,Good early 90's country,"This is one of the CD's I got for my 12th birthday, along with my first CD player, so I'll try to keep my review from being clouded by nostalgia. I think the album is solid from top to bottom: it's a fair representation of Alabama's sound in the early 90's, with plenty of slick ballads and upbeat, uptempo songs. The best cuts are The Cheap Seats, Still Goin' Strong (with a horn section!), That Feeling, and of course Reckless, the first single.2 points:1) Angels Among Us is a classic, but you should be aware that the version on this album is NOT the popular single version. The vocals here are slightly different. The popular vocal reprise version is on Greatest Hits Vol. III.2) The cover art is awesome. It seems like very few country albums (like Garth's In Pieces) have any sort of theme as far as art direction goes, so it's nice when an artist tries something unique."
3,average quality,The tapes are okay. I use them in a science class to measure distances while doing lab activities. Already one of the wind up latches popped off. The tapes just don't seem like they will hold up over the long haul.
1,Where is the river?,"After reading this book, I know a bit more about Cronin's divorce and Kennedy's recovery from substance abuse than I do about the Hudson River."
1,An ego-trip,"Reading this book, it would appear that Cronin and Kennedy alone are responsible for the slow resurgence of the Hudson. You'd hardly guess from reading this book that thousands of other activists stand shoulder to shoulder with these celebrity environmentalists. What an ego-trip. What total self-absorbtion. Disheartening."
1,BORING,This book was so boring. Thats why they have documantaries cuz no one wants to read this book. I was forced to read this for a school assignment. I have to sya some parts were interesting but the twilight series is WAY better. stop wsting our time reading these books and read twilight!
5,"Great service, best yet","I'd order all my books from them if i could, plus it supports a charity. It got here quickly and in good condition. Completely satisfied"
5,Excellent review of environmental laws,Great review of the environmental laws of our country and of the appalling greed and deliberate fouling of a great river by corporations.
4,BBall,This game is fun because it has a lot of options but once you beat all the options then your only fun is multiplayer
1,The Xbox controller is killing the gameplay of this GAME,"This is a great game but the xbox controller is killing it you have to do tricks with the x and y button which is very hard and if you read a review at gamepro.COM stated When all three versions of Street go head-to-head, the PS2 game is the surprising winner-even in the graphics department.So i would give it a rent before buying or if you have a ps2 get it for the ps2 you won't regret it.Dont get me wrong i love my xbox but i could barly pull of moves and tricks.So the next thing i did was return the game back to gamestop and picked up the ps2 version.The ps2's 4 shoulder buttons is smooth and perfect for a game like this and ssx.AND YES I Was using the controller s for the xbox.So i would not recommend buying this i would give it a rent.TRUST ME ,IF NOT GO AND BUY IT AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT."
4,Awesome!,"This game is great. Once you get it down, your ballin up. Its not very realistic, but thats kinda the point. The stuff the players do are INSANE! Theres really only one thing to do when you sorta go into a career mode. You get well known and stuff. But after that its not 2 fun. But when you start over its still koOl. GET IT! (if u dont have it!)Later."
4,"READ THIS, THIS GAME HAS PROS AND CONS","WUZZUP ma peeps, im a jaican baller and i cant get enough of this game the graphics r of the hook and its got some sick moves but this game can get a bit annoyin because there isnt many levels, but still right now its only 19.99$$ and before i bought it at 54.00$$, so even if u dont like it, at least ur getting it cheap"
4,fun but way to easy,"it is really fun but it is way to easy, since there is no goal tending you can play with yao ming and grab balls when they are on the peak of a shot, i found myself winning a 50 point pick up game by 40 points"
1,Oh Great Another Basketball Game!,"Hey really, how many basketball, football and baseball games are we going to have in the X-box format? If you haven't found one you like yet, try getting a REAL basketball and head down to the court for awhile. The electronic game industry really should get back to being innovative and lets explore some new venues. This stuff is really stale and I'm hard pressed to imagine who even buys it."
5,woooooo weeeeeee!,"What a game what a game. NBA street has set the bar for all arcade games. Whether they're fighting or racing etc... It is just so fun. They have moves, passes, dunks that you can't even imagine. Each time you press a button your jaw drops. It is one heck of a game and you should get off your computer and go get it. You will not be disappointed. MUCH RESPECT!"
5,Awsome,This is the best street basketball game i have ever played. It is great. If I was shopping for a basketball game definetley get this. The dunks are unbelievable. Trick points Gamebreakers This game goes the whole nine yards it is great.
5,NBA Street Vol. 2,"This is the best street ball game there is. I played this at the store and loved it. It is an easy pick-up game. The players are some of the NBA's greatest and current stars. There's people like Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, Wilt Chamberlain, Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, Yao Ming, and more. Play it today!"
5,The best resource I've found for feeding my child,"What an excellent tool for parents. My husband and I have eaten primarily home cooked meals for 15 years, and now I can continue that tradition with our son. The book provides wonderful alternatives to jarred foods when baby just won't eat. I found creative ideas to use throughout the preschool years, as well.I've given several copies away as baby gifts, not only to first time moms, but to those who are having a second or third child. This book is full of helpful and fun ideas for mealtime and snacks."
2,Disappointing,"I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go."
2,why rush babies to eat mush?,"This book is better than jarred baby food, but not much. Babies should be breastfed for at least the first year, and offered solids when they become interested. If you have to grind it up and mush it to give it to them, they are probably too young to want it anyway. Skip the grinders, food processors and freezer trays and just wait until your baby wants the food you are eating"
5,Perfect gift for new Moms!,I always give this gift to new Moms. I have my own copy that is 21 years old and falling apart. My kids still use it to make dough and play dough - even the 21 year old college student who uses the dough as a stress reliever during finals!
3,"Feed Me, I'm Yours: Baby Food Made Easy!","Rated as okay because it wasn't in the best of condition when received. It took quite awhile to receive after ordering.The book itself has great ideas for making babies first food fun and easy. Even though it is out of print, it is worth having areprint of the book available for new moms & grandparents."
5,The Book On Telephone Cold Calling.,"I've read just about every sales book out there.If you cold call on the phone, this is the book. Whether you are calling to set an appointment, or to sell o the phone, everything you need is right here.If you sell insurance, securities, stocks, investments, or anything that can be sold over the phone...this is the book. Everything written her applies today as well as 20 years ago. Get your own copy. You can't have mine."
4,"Good read, information is relevant in 2013","Since the 90's telephone sales and appointment setting have become much much harder because of regulation and the general opinion of salespeople and tele-sales.The book covers a lot of the good points of selling, cold calling, and some conversational skills. If you have a few extra bucks and need some pointers on the phone that you don't get through hard hard work, I'd recommend picking up the book."
4,Expensive but worth it,"I borrowed a copy of this via interlibrary loan while working on my own new book COOL MAPS OF INDONESIA (Nimble Books LLC 2007). The HISTORICAL ATLAS OF INDONESIA is a very useful scholarly compendium of hundreds if not thousands of maps developed using a very extensive GIS. Features I particularly liked were a list of islands over x size and a map that showed name changes next to islands. Most of the maps are based on modern era data. This would be an excellent reference for any library. Indeed, I might say it's a must purchase, given that Indonesia has the 4th largest population of any country in the world."
2,Only for extremely skilled Sumerian studs,"This compilation consists of a collection of receipts and tribute lists from the Mesopotamian Empire known as the Third Dynasty of Ur. So, as the name suggests it is a rather highly intellectual book, that most I think will find boring. I thought my nerdiness might seperate me from the crowd who thinks this is boring, but I was wrong. I had the incorrect preconceived notion that English translations would be available for the text, which assumption proved false. This volume consists predominantly of transcribed Sumerian and reproductions of clay tablets. It is more like a reference book for the serious Sumerologist, not a book for light reading. It is interesting in a way, but only truly profitable to the foremost Sumerian scholars."
3,Not Your Typical SRV,"As a SRV fan, I was a bit disappointed with this CD, partly because I expected to hear a little more of his incendiary guitar playing and soulful vocals. While it's apparent the Vaughan Brothers are having fun collaborating on songs that range in style from Texas Swing, R&B;, Country (and yes, even a little Funk), I can't help but feel that SRV underplayed in this one.I did love the prophetic and beautiful ""Tick-Tock"" and the R&B-infused; ""Telephone Song,"" two songs that give you a glimpse of what might have been in SRV's musical future. In addition, Jimmie and Stevie's work on the instrumental D/FW (a hometown tribute) is exceptional and is a great ""car tune.""While I don't regret purchasing this CD--the aforementioned songs are well worth the price of admission--I was a bit surprised by the corny voiceovers and sound effects sprinkled throughout. Nevertheless, if you love SRV and Jimmie, you will forgive them and add this to your collection."
4,A Nice Change of Pace,"Usually the music of Stevie Ray Vaughn has a dark sounding blues tone. On this release, with his brother Jimmy, the tone is alot more upbeat. Even some of the music shows some other influences like the soulful Tick Tock and the bouncy White Boots. There are four instrumental pieces(two have vocals effects) and each of them have a special freshness to them. Its a darn shame that Stevie had to die in that helicopter crash. Who knows what other great music would we have received. None the less this is a nice collaboration."
5,Vaughn Brothers Rock,"I got this CD as a present from my sister when it first came out, and to this day, I can't stop playing it. With tunes like the rocking ""DFW"", the melodic ""Tick Tock"", the hard-driving, blues-influenced ""Brothers"", and the fun-to-listen-to ""Good Texan"" & ""Boom Bapaboom"", Family Style has a little bit of everything. Although Stevie's voice is usually only in the background, it is his talent of improvisational guitar-playing that I love to hear. Jimmy's voice, on-the-other-hand, becomes a soothing rhythm, backing-up his brother's hard-edge style of playing. I became a fan of Stevie & Jimmie just by playing this CD; and now I won't stop until I get all their music in my collection."
5,The Brothers At Their Best,"Family Style is perhaps Stevie Ray Vaughan's last record before his tragic death in 1990. I love Family Style for so many reason's mainly due to Stevie Ray Vaughan who was expanding his guitar vocabulary further than he had the previous year. Jimmie Vaughan was also at the peek of his career both of the brothers were a good mix between texas blues. I think for the most part the musicians were all different it added a new flavor to Stevie Ray's style. My very favorite song is Long Way From Home, and Brothers. Family Style would reach 7 on the charts becoming Stevie Ray Vaughan's most succesful album. I personally think this is a must have album for any die hard fans of the guitar. Buy this!"
3,NOT A MASTERPIECE - ONLY SATISFACTORY,"Dare I say it? Family Style by Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan is only a ""satisfactory"" cd. The music itself leans to light country and rock music with very little rock blues. This selection of material by the Vaughan Brothers is a big disappointment to the fan of blues and rock blues music. Most of the songs on Family Style are at least a bit pleasant to listen to. However, I truly dislike the song Tick Tock. This song simply does not belong on Family Style. I rarely keep cds that I believe are only rated as ""satisfactory."" I have decided to get rid of Family Style. There's no point in listening to Family Style when there are many blues and rock blues cds that sound so much better. My recommendation to you is to NOT BUY Family Style.John"
2,didn't do the trick for me,I've been experimenting with recording my digital keyboard and connecting it directly to my computer had terrible quality. This unit improved it to an extent but it was still poor quality (maybe it was not meant to do this type of work). I ended up returning it.
2,iMic has limits,"For whatever reason, and I'm not a computer geek, the iMic doesn't let me hook a conventional SM-58 microphone into Garageband. I was convinced by reviewers and the company's description that it would, but looking back I see the language is very vague on this. I haven't tried any of the other uses (hooking up turntables or tape decks), but I did successfully hook up a non preamp pickup for my acoustic guitar. And it has to do with the vagaries of Garageband as well, which turns out to be more of a toy than a dependable demo maker."
1,Didn't do anything,"I bought this item to connect a microphone to my MacBook. It supposedly has line and microphone settings. I got no amplification of the microphone at all on the mic setting. It was just like plugging the mic directly into the computer. Next I bought an ArtTube preamp, which worked for one day and started crackling. Finally I bought a Blue Yeti mic, which works great."
1,Not Windows 7 Compatible,"Nowhere on the product description does it say it's not Windows Vista or 7 compatible. A big sarcastic ""thank you"" to Amazon for not telling us what it's compatible with."
4,Great,Mainly i bought this because the headphone jack had broken on my laptop and because i had heard its a great item to have. Sure enough when i first got it and tried it out it was awesome the sound was 100 times clearer then your usual headphone jack and installation with windows 7 is very easy. all in all great thing to have if you like music
2,What's that whooshing air sound?,"I bought one of these and tested it out compared to the audio-in jack on my PowerMac.The audio-in gets a lot cleaner results. With the iMic you hear a whooshing air sound coming through with the music, not so with the audio-in jack.SO if you don't have audio-in on your laptop like with my iBook then it's ok but definitely inferior audio capture quality compared to a line input."
4,Solved Mac Mini noise problem on headphone output,"The headphone output on both a G4 and Intel mac mini have the same noise problem when connecting the analog headphone jack to my audioengine2 powered speakers, or the inputs of a AV receiver. The G4 mini even had AM radio reception on the headphone output. I tried a simple passive isolation transformer and the noise got worse. I use the iMic (original silver version) as a USB audio output port feeding the line level input to the audioengine speakers. The digital noise and hum are now gone and I can finally turn up the powered speaker output volume. I cannot speak to the audiophile quality of this device, just that the iMic output sound is clear and dynamic. iMic has effectively eliminated the digital switching noise coupling in to the mini's headphone output jack."
3,good for the average user,"This product is great for a person that just wants another outlet to DJ or record from. To be honest with you though, this really should not be used for high end audio recording or playback. Overall though, this product fits it's purpose and does it well."
3,Griffin iMic/USB Audio Interface,I bought my iMic to transfer Records to CD.I wanted to use it with my Laptop. They say it doesn't work with Windows Vista. I have no problem recording with Nero 8. I can't get it to work as a line out device(Windows Vista).This may be due to Vista or my Notebook's Sound card? But since I save to the hard drive and burn a CD this has not been a problem.You can also save to a USB Flash or External Drive to work around this problem with Vista.
4,Griffin iMic/USB Audio Interface,Product works as advertised. Great way to convert any analog signal coming out of your turntable/stereo receiver into digital files. The only problem I have noticed is a tendency to generate a static signal after extended recording sessions.I needed to experiment with various line out options from my receiver until I found one that worked without static/interference. The other work around I have found is to Quit and Restart their free software application Final Vinyl after each record. This may well be a problem with the software and other more sophisticated programs are available. I am sure that someone more knowledgeable about these devices and applications would not have any problem at all getting this to work right out of the box.
4,good,"It does what it promises. The program is a little sketchy, but works. Be sure to update your Quicktime before you try to open"
5,Perfect for transfering vinyl to digital,This product has allowed me to move all my music solely on vinyl to my iPod with ease. The Final Vinyl software is easy to use once you get the hang of it too.
2,Does NOT directly accept Guitar,"This device, despite the description, does NOT have 1/4 inch jacks. The product description says ""All you need is a USB port"" and ""Plug microphones and musical instruments directly into iMic.""Good luck with that.Also, it seems very flimsy and not built to last."
1,Never worked,Received the Imic in a timely manner. Tried to use it to record some old vinyl records. I assumed that I was doing something wrong using the software. I tried again a couple of weeks later and the computer would not even recognize the Imic..totally dead. Contacted Amazon and the seller to get a replacement. No action whatsoever. I may have just gotten a bad unit but don't know since seller will not respond with a replacement.
2,Disappointed,"Since this is touted as a product for connecting retrograde equipment to current computer quickly and easily, it seems really thoughtless to sell a device that is not plug-compatible. I suppose it would cost more to add two sets of connectors that might never get used, but it's quite annoying to buy this thing and then discover it needs an adaptor cable. iMic really needs be labeled and marketed with pictures of plugs it supports since the text description ""1/8"" stereo"" isn't meaningful to the non-technical. I know what the plugs I have look like. If I had known I had to research them in advance i probably would have looked for another product. I wanted plug and play, and iMic isn't for me.And where's the software? I had to hunt through the literature to find website."
4,It's exactly what he wanted!,I bought this for my son who is a music teacher and wants to use it for some recording of LP's to computer - it's exactly what he asked for and needed.Bernie
2,Not good for PC,"Manufacturer says the iMic isolates the noise of hardware. Well, I connected the iMic in my PC and began recording cassettes and vinyls. The first problem is the low input signal, so I had to increase it to hear the recorded songs in a good volume and to set a decent recording level. The sound is very good, but in the silence between songs a noise appears. It comes from the power supply unit fan of the PC. Is a high frequency noise being heard every time between songs, even at low volume. I've tried to filter that, but I lose quality of sound.If I connect directly my deck to the in-line of the PC, the signal is so strong that I have to set the recording level to the minimum and the noise of the fan is very low compared to recorded signal, so I do not hear undesirable noises, even at highest reproducing level. The solution for me is to connect a preamplifier to the turntable.Maybe the iMic will work well in a notebook, but not in a PC."
4,"Gratuitous with most iMacs, but the software is still useful.","If you have a computer with audio in and out jacks, you don't need the USB interface. What's disappointing is that Final Vinyl doesn't appear to be available as a separate program. As a previous viewer mentioned, it's superior to Spin Doctor, the vinyl-to-digital conversion program included with Roxio's Toast. Roxio has made no significant improvements to the program through the last several editions of Toast. Spin Doctor is colorful, and occasionally it does quite well by automating the procedure of recognizing the separate tracks on an LP. But the wave patterns are essentially useless for any sort of precise editing, and the capabilities for post-conversion filters, equalization, etc. are comparatively limited. If your primary purpose is to convert vinyl to digital, programs like WireTap Studio, Sound Studio, and Final Vinyl are the better bet. (If you use PC's, Cool Edit still leads the pack.)"
5,iMic is a great product to go along with djay software,I use the iMic with djay software because it allows me to cue up the next piece of music while the current song is playing. djay is pretty basic software this device makes it a richer software because makes all the features usable.
2,High-Quality Recording... Oh Yeah?,"I am pleased with the ease of the interface, but I was a little disappointed with the recording quality. It wasn't much better then the computer's internal microphone."
2,Not Compatible with Newer Windows Versions,"Although the Technical Details for this product claim that it's compatible with ""all Mac and PC systems with a USB port"" it isn't. Griffin's own website says it's not compatible with Windows Vista. We found it to be incompatible with Windows Server 2003 and 2008 also. We're returning the four that we bought.The box says the product is compatible with Windows 7. We didn't test it under Windows 7.I'm told it works great with Macs."
1,Worked great for almost 5 weeks then suddenly ....,"I started getting errors that the device was demanding too much power and that it was going to be disabled . I was using this with Mac OSX 10.7.4, Macbook Pro"
5,Works as Expected,"I am using the iMic so that I can use a microphone which requires mic levels with my Macbook Pro that only provides line level. The iMic works perfectly, the computer recognized the device without any issues at all and the sound quality is great.The iMic also works fine with windows 7, no issues with device recognition.I've mainly been using the iMic for Skype calls, and Skype had no problems using it for input and/or output."
3,(Mac+iMic+Pc headset)/skype = ziltch,"The output is great, no hiss, no purr no noticeable nasty 50hz (60hz) hum. But:I was going to use the input labeled ""mic"" to plug in an un-amplified headset designed for PCs so I could use the setup for skype on my mac. I was under the impression that the input would permit this since its got a variable gain linear (short) pot. well this didn't work. I do get a signal but it's incredibly weak, even with all controls set to maximum sensitivity.The documentation on the Griffin site mentions that some mics will require a preamp... a preamp for a preamp? yes.By not implementing a preamp with sufficient latitude, Griffin's made this thing a bit too simple and fool proof I'd say (I understand you don't want users to plug line-level devices into an electret preamp... still.I like it, mainly for the quality of the output, but again the input's not working with basic electret mics."
2,Griffib iMic,I found the iMic unusable for my intended purpose. Their advertising says it may be used with any microphone. I found that it would not work with the most common type of dynamic microphone. After several e-mail messages back and forth they advised that it would work with a relatively rare high impedance dynamic microphone.
3,It works well for lectures,I've purchased this item for my iPad. I've tried several audio USB adapters with the ipad camera connection kit and this is the only one that has worked well. It is very easy to use the adapter. I've not rated four stars because I only use it for recording lectures and I've not tested the quality of music recording.
5,Yes It will work with Vista! Just need to change a Vista setting,"I recently bought a laptop with Vista and initially thought what other reviewers have mentioned and that since Vista will only see the Imic as a mono input it was next to useless...BUT... I did some poking in Vista's settings and found the solution. After installing the Imic go to ""Sound"" In the Vista Control Panel. Click on the ""recording tab"" then highlight the Imic and click on ""properties"". In the window that pops up click on the ""advanced"" tab. In there under the catagory ""Default Format"" change the drop down menu to ""2 Channel 16 bit 44100 Hz (CD Quality)"". You will now be able to record in stereo with Imic in Vista! I've used the Imic for over a year, previously with XP and now with Vista and love it."
4,iMic 2 is a necessity for recording,"I record a lot of vocals directly into my pc, and I thought that the iMic 2 may cancel out a significant amount of distortion since it connects to USB instead through the sound card. I was right and wrong, if you try recording into your pc with the iMic set to mic level input, recording will still sound very distorted. But if you have it set to line level input practically all distortion is wiped out. I am very pleased with how the iMic performs at such a low price. Out put is pretty weak though."
4,Works exactly like it says it will!,"I downloaded Audacity free. I hooked up the iMic to my PC and my boombox. Then I started Audacity and clicked play on my cassette tape; when I clicked on Audacity's record button, the cassette was recorded to my PC! I sync'd it to my mp3 player and listened just fine. I may need to learn more and finetune if I want great quality, but I was finishing a library book while out of town and it worked fine. I thought it a neat gadget!! Some of you will be WAY creative and enjoy it a lot, I think. If I were rating it for quality sound and music, I probably would only give 3 stars...but that could be due to my inexperience!! Worth a try at the price, I think. :O)"
4,imic,"This product is awesome, although some instructions may be helpful. A little confusing to get started using the product, but works well after the initial set up. Have recommended to friends."
2,Quality degraded from earlier version.,"I have an iMic that is several years old and love it. I ordered one for my wife's iMac and was appalled at how they've changed it. The cable on mine is seriously heavy duty and shielded. The cable on the new one is fragile, so fragile that our 6 month old kitten chewed through it in no time flat and it went into the garbage. She could NEVER chew through mine!"
2,Rivals 8-Track sound quality!!,"If you like your music with a heapin' helpin' of hum, buzz, static and other annoying music un-friendly effects, then this is the product for you!. The addition of the grounded turntable cord helped somewhat and made the quality jump up to just annoying. If there's a cost effective way to convert vinyl albums to CDs...I'm still waiting"
4,Best or favorite?,"Brooke White was my favorite Idol this year. Whether she was the best or not, she was the one I looked forward to seeing/hearing. The most real of the group.I really like this album of hers. She makes you feel as well as enjoy the tones and color of her music."
1,Bad,This product - was bought with the thought it was a 'new' CD based on the price - the price of a CD with no hit songs on it is normally about $3.99 and that is exactly what this CD is - a CD that is three years old and no hit songs. What a waste of money -- and I threw it in the trash -
1,Not Listenable! High School Amateur Talent Show,"Unbelievably awful! Her voice is weak and the songs are hard to listen to. It is as if she recorded the CD while in high school, without any training and just thought she was good because no one else in the school sang. I have heard better singers in high school talent shows. The CD is a mess and whoever produced it should be embarrassed as should the singer."
1,truly hideous,Really the worst kind of pop music. Couldn't stand her on the show and the CD is even worse.
3,enjoyable CD,"i ran across this album while surfing amazon and previewed it. i must say the more i listen to it the more i like it. for being a low-budget independent label effort it is really good. it is really a shame that this album didn't get promotion at its release. i recommend this CD. i enjoy that it is simple arrangements, not an overly produced album and that is in part what makes it good."
4,Reminiscent of Tapestry...,"We fell in love with her on American Idol. Not just her voice but her wholesome character and personality. ""Songs From the Attic"" is folky yet contemporary. Anticipated and worth the wait. Brooke White just knows how to make you feel good!"
5,"Great Music, Great Voice","She has such a pure smoothe voice. The whole cd is great, unlike some cd where you only like a few of the songs. Highly recommend this CD. She truly is a star."
1,over-rated,"Against my better judgement, I gave this a try because of some recommendations from others. Ms. White was TERRIBLE on American Idol, and she does nothing to improve upon that for her CD. She is whiny and unoriginal, and I fail to understand how anyone can listen to her for more than a few seconds without having their ears bleed. I guess it's very much ""to each his own"", but I don't foresee a long and successful musical career for this one (and I hope that I am right, so I don't have to add her to the list of artists that would make me change the radio station)."
2,Not so hot,I loved Brooke on the show so I was a little disappointed in this CD. I'm sorry I bought it:(
1,Thought I would be wrong but.....,"I was never a fan of brooke's but decided to give her a second listen by previewing the entire cd at my local music store.Her voice has not changed from what i initially heard on AI: weak, dull, trembles at times and altogether uninspiring. It's a fine voice to sing your kid to sleep at night but not worth buying. Not every artist has to belt out a song (old school Mariah) or rock on (old school bon jovi) but to record something mediocre which, at best is fine for karaoke night, is just criminal!Granted she seems like a nice person but this is the wrong field for her. It's like saying Tory Spelling (super nice girl that she is) deserves an oscar for her acting."
4,Songs From The Attic,I recently enjoyed watching her growth in self assurance as Brooke White performed weekly on 2008 American Idol. Her Songs From the Attic CD is the beginning of a wonderful career. It is soothing to me as I drive or at home when I'm using it as background for my projects and activities. Anyone who liked her on Idol will like this CD.
5,Solid,"As a radio DJ from Omaha, I can say that nobody pumps out more number one hits than Mr. Tim McGraw, among the ones that you normally hear on your local radio stations, there are the tracks on this CD that make you never want to remove it from your CD player. You won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome!,"I've been a Country fan for years. Grew up listening to mom & dad's great albums of Charlie Pride, Ray Price, Patsy Cline and many more. My kids will say they grew up listening to the greats: Tim McGraw will be one of them!!!!"
3,Better Than Most,"I don't normally go for this type of ""pop"" country music, but I have to admit that this album is an exception to the rule. ""Where the Green Grass Grows,"" ""Everywhere,"" and ""Just to See You Smile"" standout as songs that dance the fine line between pop and progressive country. Mind you, this album is not for those who plan to be moved in any way, it still has a few of those silly songs that the teenagers enjoy, but it is a nice retreat from standard country pop fare. So sit back, pop open a cold one, and listen to this thing before you realize it's Faith Hill's husband."
4,switzerland,"i have to confess, i used to hate country music (and somehow still do), but this voice....oh my God. this man got it !"
2,"nice idea, bad quality",This was a nice tuner and worked great for a couple of months. Then it just plain died. Not a battery issue. It wasn't abused or dropped that I know of either. It just died. Too bad.
5,Such a great book,My kids just love this book. The pictures are bright without too many words on the pages and the stories are just right for new readers. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to introduce bible stories to their children.
5,A Cathartic experience from the depths of the soul.,"I find ""Places"" a must for music listeners who are seeking a new transcendent journey into the avantgarde and improvisational sound."
4,Wonderful in every way but the price tag,"An excellent workbook for experienced and beginning actors. Much more than a 'checklist', it can be used as a class textbook or a personal aid to creating the complete character. There's nothing new in here, just a very fine compilation of the best methods and techniques, logically arranged, complete with exercises for each section. This is definitely my favorite resource for my own acting work. The only disappointment is the price. I would like to make this the required text book for my adult students, but I feel the cost is too high. $12-$15 would be more appropriate."
1,DON'T!,"Do not get into this mess, please! You will never get to put it together. There are a million pieces, all so flimsy and breakable that by the time you start thinking you are progressing, you will find yourself in the middle of just trash."
2,Terrible trail maps,"Although the trails are well described and a fair amount of geological and historical background is presented, the trail maps make this book almost worthless. For instance, Hike No. 22 is shown on Map No. 18. The trail is described on page 70 and the map is on page 180. Does this sound confusing? It is. Also, the overview maps for each park show campgrounds and ranger stations, but they don't show where the individual trails are located. These desert parks are enormous, and the lack of good overview maps makes it nearly impossible to determine, for instance, what hikes are near the south entrance to Joshua Tree. Pass on this book."
3,Pinto Wye Arrestra,The photo of the arrastra is not a photo of the one at Pinto Wye. The heavy growth of junipers is only one tree. The description of this hike was inaccurate. A more reliable description is needed for adequate preparation for a hike.
4,Half-hearted Low fan chimes in,"I admit that I'm not that into Low so my words may ring hollow, but i think there are some amazing remixes on this. Anybody who denies the power of the Porter Ricks remix of Down, including Low fans, hasn't really listened to it without an axe to grind. I've played it for so many people, none of whom have even heard of Low, and they are almost always astonished. It's kind of like listening to a primordial ooze of white noise coalesce into a song played by ghosts in love. Low fans and yoga-practitioners with enough patience for this (13 minute long) song will be rewarded. The best songs by far are Down, Words & Over the Ocean. If you have this cd and like those three songs, I recommend The Notwist's ""Neon Golden"", Console's ""Reset the Preset"", The Postal Service's ""Give Up"" & Dntel's ""Life is Full of Possibilites"". Another good (though uneven) album like this is the Mogwai remix project ""Kicking a Dead Pig""."
3,Low for those with ADD,"Low's consistently minimal aesthetic is too tempting for admirers not to remix, cover, and in some cases immolate. There are so many suggestions of bell-like tones, submerged beats and erased tracks in their album material that when collaborators like Neotropic and Skull Valley Dub are allowed to tweak and augment, many of these seemingly drowned sounds bubble to the surface.While some of the remixers on this collection take a more minimal approach that sounds like the band itself -- but in an extremely insular or experimental mode -- a few remixes go in an opposite direction like the busy but confectionary remix of ""Over The Ocean,"" with its percolating horns and sliced-and-diced vocals.Overall, the album remains calming even though rife with textures and beats.As other reviews have noted, this is perhaps not the best starting point in the Low catalog, though it is of interest to fans or those who like unconventional electronic collaborations."
2,I really tried to like this.,"I can only repeat what others already have stated...This record could maybe please some electronica fans, but if you're a Low fan, you probably won't like this.The remixes seem ""cheap"" and I feel the end result could have been better."
3,Not a must have album.,"I'd only recommend this album after purchasing (in order of release dates) I could live in hope, Long division, Transmission (ep), Curtain hits the cast, and Songs for a dead pilot (ep). This album is ok, especially for background music. It's just that all of the spiritual gravity behind the songs seems to have gotten mixed out as some otherwise capable people tried to bring Low to the masses."
3,"Rediscover 'I Could Live In Hope,' try to enjoy the groove.","Not bad, but not great. Remix albums continually fall victim to the distruction of brilliant material. As far as 'Owl' is concerned, ""Over the Ocean"" should have been left alone! Other than that, there are some interesting new visions pressent from the album 'I Could Live In Hope' which I rarely listened to before 'Owl.' Particularly Jimmy Somerville's remix of ""Words,"" which is typical Somerville, but holds a decent contemporary club feel. Aside from the ""Over the Ocean"" remixes, the album is pretty good for Low listeners to rediscover the hooks and drama that made us like them in the first place. Another remix album along the same lines to check out is Swirlies - Strictly East Coast Sneaky Flute Music."
2,Not a headphone pleaser,"This CD might make good background music at a coffee shop, but upon close inspection, like through headphones, this cd's flaws are glaring.Nice try though. I think the folks at Kranky would be best qualified to remix low. The Ninjatune artist are way too pop."
1,LOW shown no respect....,"I love live music, but even more so the ethereal haunting edge that only LOW can deliver. I also have been a big fan of the Dance/Electronica scene, and this album seemed to promise as intriguing fusion of both styles . Unfortunatley LOW'S incredible music has been swept aside by nieve immature non musicianship of amazing ineptitude. If this were just a cheap DnB album it would of been cast aside in the bargain bin along with countless other albums of Lift music. This is not LOW, just some a hopeless attempt to steal some light from one of the most incredible bands around. GO buy Trust, Things we lost in the fire or Secret Name .. and really experience LOW."
1,THE WORST OF CLIMAX ?,"I really wanted this CD for the track ""Caroline, This Time"", a minor hit for climax back in the 70's. Didn't get much airplay, but I used to love this song. Anyway, after waiting years to hear it again, I wish I would have kept waiting. If I close my eyes while listening, I would think I'm listening to a 45 RPM record on an old portable battery operated record player with a bad needle! By far, the worst quality CD I have ever heard. If the first CD ever released sounded like this, the world would have stayed with records and turntables! EXTREMELY disappointed in Carousel Records! Should re-name the CD ""The Worst of Climax!"
3,Difficult but Great,"I purchased this book for my research in ritual practice. Bourdieu is a dense read, but the theories presented are solid."
5,Bourdieu kicks Foucault's ...,"How could anyone put Foucault above Bourdieu? Bourdieu has a rigorous sociology behind his work & provides a real theoretical groundwork to reconcile materialist, interpretive/symbolic and interactionist perspectives. Foucault on the other hand has led anthropologists down a slippery slope of prevarication, vagueness, grandstanding and an obsession with a hollow & impoverished idea of what constitutes a ""critical"" stance."
4,Not quite as pictured,"The picture shown has a painted bear, but the extension has only the indent for the bear. The play area is excellent though."
2,One piece extension?,"I should have read the measurements better, so this is my fault, but one piece extension kit? It doesn't really make the play yard any larger...it's ONE PIECE."
4,An oversized play pen.,"We got this item for our 1 yr old daughter. This thing is great, it was set up in minutes and will somewhat keep the toddler in one place, by that I mean even our 1 yr old is able to push the playpen around and move it across the living room. Thats the only problem that I can see. The construction is very good because with a 5yr old and a 7yr old (that have no concept of the door) insist on climbing over the sides time after time, has held up very well. Being made of plastic it can be taken outside and cleaned with a garden hose and mild soap. I would highly recommend to anyone."
4,Nice Addition,"Purchased these with the main Playzone system in order to make the space bigger for my daughter. My wife and I like having the extra space, so we can play along."
5,Safe enclosed area for 8 mo.old babies and toddlers,The Friendly Toys Little Playzone Extension Kit is a useful addition to the Friendly Toys Little Playzone. I can complete chores knowing my grandson is safe and playing with his toys in a secure colorful area. Of course I'm always checking on him and I often sit in the playzone playing with him!
1,not compatible with other similar playpens,"Make sure you're current playpen is compatible with this extension. After we got it, we had difficulty getting connecting the extension. It would work eventually if you put enough force."
5,F A N T A S T I C,"This ""playpen"" is amazing. My granddaughter does not mind (most of time) being in it because she does not feel enclosed. There is lots of room for her to play, and we can even get in with her. Its very light and easy to put together and take apart. It also travels easily."
4,Good for little ones not yet walking or climbers,I bought the playzone and extension to use when my almost one year old grandson came for a visit and I do not have a totally child proof house so I wanted a safe place for him to spend some time without my constant attention on him. This worked great with the one extension but I am going to buy a secone extension to make it larger. I would not recommend it to anyone with a climber though. His big sister was 3 and could climb in and out without assistance to play with him. It served the purpose and we will keep it around for other small children in our extended family.
5,Better than a playpen!,Our 1 year old grandson loves it when his parents have room to sit in it and play with him. It feels more like a fort than a playpen.
3,The Harry Nilsson Anthology,A couple of great songs in there you just have to listen to a great voice singing some crap ones as well
5,No,"I did not buy this disc for myself, but for my 50+ year old son who tells me ""he loves it"". In fact he's found a track on it that he's been looking for , for a long time. so he's happy."
4,The Best Of The Rest!!!,"This is a great compilation of Harry Nilsson starting out with his autobiography song 1941 all the way up to his last songs released in 1977 !!! The only problem is they could have added a few more favorites this compilation like Cuddly Toy , The Puppy Song which were included on his Single Cd Greatest Hits also they could have included Kojak Columbo and Who Done It, maybe even the Long version instead of the Single version of Jump into the Fire but overall a nice package!!!"
5,Trancendental Experience,"Such a wonderful voice and great collection. I was disappointed not to hear 'The Puppy Song'( but that is why I bought the 'You've Got Mail' Soundtrack.) Nilsson was such a shining light that reading the liner notes and finding out what happened to his voice while recording with John Lennon really made me angry with John Lennon for instilling that kind of fear into someone as loving as Harry apparently was. What a waste. However, all of Harry's lovely vocalisations on his most famous tunes are here to be enjoyed and relived. I can never feel blue while listening to this collection. It is a great tribute to a wonderful voice, composer, and person. Thanks Harry."
2,Totally Wasted Opportunity,"Ok what is here is ok but really?????? Where are Cuddly Toy, The Puppy Song, and Living Without You????? A complete idiot must have put this together!!!! Avoid at all costs and get Greatest Hits instead."
3,"Not as fun as Lego Batman, Star Wars, or Indiana Jones",My son is 7. He loves the Lego video game series. I saw this and thought it would be fun. He played this two times and hasn't picked it up since.
3,Lego racers 2,"My son loves the game. I play with him sometimes on 2 player mode , I had a hard time saving the game . It doesn't seem to have auto save which I like so that when you get to a point , it will save automatically. My son is 6 , loves Lego anything. You can build your oun cars to drive , put them together w/ the parts they give you, that is a great feature. For me the game could be better but it's pretty good , my son gives it a great score, I give it a medium score. For some reason I have to unplug the joy pad to get to the menu to move the selection to save the game. It gave me a bit of a hard time for that reason -- I lowered my opinion of the game. Enjoy!"
1,Making Children Cry,"... If you want to make your kid cry this is a good way:1. Confusing and counterintuitive interface2. Difficult steering of the car3. Cheating opponents enhance educational value4. Impossible to win races5. Your characters steals some car parts to make the game even more educationalIronically enough the developer company is called ""Attention to Detail"" Attention to what ???????????"
1,go away,"Almost every night, I sit here and wonder why we have so many video games in the world. What makes this game even worse is the fact that it really wants to be a Mario Kart game. We already have Mario Kart, so this game is pointless.This game continues to get worse the more I play it. Good luck trying to control your vehicle. I was never able to do that. I kept crashing and wouldn't be able to win any of the races. I really want you to avoid this game."
3,So so...,"I have a baby - the first for that, and want to get her as many ""right"" toys as possible. I did not know what to expect. In fact, it's my brother who deciphered the idea behind the toy.I think it is a good toy for a baby in the early stages. She was excited when she got them and even if she is still just 8 months, she looked engrossed into it. Hmmm! I think it will be more fitting at a year+."
1,Not the true Johnny,"Sad to say, but we all get old. The thing is, JW is only 60, but he looks and sounds like 80. I hope he is well, since Johnny Winter is possibly the finest blues guitarist (and vocalist) there ever was, black, white or very white, as the case may be.While Mr Winter shows himself every now and then, the performances are feeble and weak. If you get this, do so only out of respect for the master."
2,leave this one alone,"i can't figure out why this album was even released. i know fans have waited about 7 years for a new album from johnny since the 1997 live in new york. in that album johnny was already showing signs of serious health problems that have affected both his singing and his once powerful guitar playing, the span of the last 8 years have seen johnny in such a state that his voice is but a whisper and his guitar playing is very labored. the only reason for 2 stars is a good backup band and a solid choice of material.this album will be a painful downer for any fans of johnnys music and playing"
3,Fade-outs detract from this cd,"I have been following Johnny's career, at a distance from Australia, since 1968 and have every previous recording by Johnny, both vinyl and CD.Apparently Johnny has not been very well over the last couple of years, and at sixty why should he be releasing albums which sound like ""yesteryear""?It is great that he explores new sounds and techniques.My only criticism is why have fade-out on some tracks? The album is about 50 minutes, therefore there is at least 30 minutes of blank space on the CD. On one of the tracks Johnny is faded out while he is singing!! Other tracks are inappropriately shortened. Gone are the days of vinyl with only 40 minutes of time available. This is ""old mindset"" ideas.The fade-outs are the reason for my lower rating.I am a doctor and I am sure that my patients would not be very happy if I quietly left the room before the consultation was completed!"
1,Sad chapter in a great career,"The band does the best they can in support of a terribly diminished Johnny Winter, but there just isn't much to work with anymore. The '97 live album was weak - and I'm a Bluesman never even rises to that level. This might sound cruel, but Johnny putting out this record is like Ali returning to the ring. Instead of buying this get one of his many incredible works, and if you already own them all buy another copy of your favorite and turn somebody else on to the best blues rocker ever."
4,He is the best,"I just want to comment on the review saying that Johnny winter has never been an even average vocalist. This is totaly wrong. I have studied both song and guitarplaying for many years and I want you who don't think that Johnny can sing, to for example listen to I'll drown in my tears. I can't honestly think of any artist who could sing the way he does on that song. It's absolutely fantastic."
1,amatuer effort,"this is definetely a low water moment for mr winter with this poorly pieced together album.these songs were recorded over a span of 3 years with johnnys poor health slowing down the project. there is nothing good to recommend on this album. poor choppy guitar playing, vocals that are off key and off timing and a baffling selection of songs.hopefully he will get better at a future date and have the chance to release something that is actually entertaining."
5,Still Alive and Well,"I'm A BluesmanFor more than 30 years, Johnny Winter has been at the forefront of modern blues and blues-rock, and his new I'm A Bluesman disc, out on Virgin Records, figures to add to his Texas-sized reputation.For this release, Johnny has again paired with his long-time producer Dick Shurman (Robert Cray, Albert Collins, Roy Buchanan), as well as Tom Hambridge (Susan Tedeschi, George Thorogood). Backing him is his scorching road-tested touring band of ace harmonica man James Montgomery, bassist Scott Spray and drummer Wayne June, with new guitarist Paul Nelson who co-penned the title track.Guest appearances feature such friends as keyboardist Reese Wynans (from Stevie Ray Vaughan's celebrated backing group Double Trouble) among others. Did someone say grammy?Modern blues review"
3,Age and health are catching up to him,"I was excited to see that Johnny Winter had a new CD and couldn't wait to listen to it, but from the very first song it was obvious that time is catching up with him. I've read that he is 60 years old, in the photo on the cover he looks 70 and unfortunately sounds like it too often on this CD. The songs are good, but not great. There are mostly mid-tempo blues rock songs that will keep you dancing and singing along, but there isn't one that will stick with you afterward. Johnny's voice is a whisper of his former mad dog growl and even his guitar playing has suffered. The speed and precision aren't there and some songs it even sounds like he's having difficulty playing at all. This isn't a bad CD, just a rough one, especially if your used to listening to Johnny at his peak."
5,Stop The Funeral,"This book is an on time word for today, though it was written years ago. Excellence always from Bishop Donald Hilliard. This message is nothing less."
2,some info but nothing you probably dont have in another book,"i think this book *may* have value for some but it hasnt for me...i found that the info was a re-hash of other info available in other books (that most people already have by the time they buy this book) while some of the info is good i think this info PLUS other info can all be found in other books without buying separate versions...for instance i feel everything about what is appropreate for kids is available in the *unnoficial* disney books plus those books give a weath of info on more subjects.. i just feel that the disney trip is expensive enough..without thinking you *need* this book... some might get some info out of this book, but i would say *need* is a strong word...i think this is an adjunct at best"
5,Metal Gods,"No long story but it has to be said: This DVD is pure metal bliss!Priest with Halford is the real deal again, the sound is phenomenal. Watch it in the dark on a big screen and a good home theater system and you might just find yourself blown away like Marty in Back to the Future, if you remember the scene with that oversized amp.My favorites: The Ripper, Judas Rising, Revolution, Painkiller and, I can't help it, Diamonds and Rust.Oh, and Scott Travis? Now that's what I call a drummer!"
3,"Good, but","Good, but I did not enjoy editing (Still fast for my tasting) and the overall color schemes of show and the fact that there are absolutely no extras.For the band itself, no complains: they play hard as always. I just think it's becoming somekind of cliche to record live shows at the Budokan."
4,Judas Priest is Still Here!,"I really enjoy this concert, and watching the band rock on with so many great songs. I love the 3 options of audio to your liking. Yes, everyone is getting older but they still Rock the House down. I have All of the Priest albums considering they are one of my all time favorite band. The stage is Huge and I feel they could've done a lot more to the stage and with props and stuff. I did like the Harley Davidson coming out of the smoke. I love watching the cute oriental girls head banging and rocking out with the songs, and damn, they are so adorable and cute. The crowd was having a great time and everyone was singing and waving their hands around, so that is always a great crowd to have. I love the several Heavy costumes that Rob Halford are wearing and the way he walks around the stage, he OWNS that stage. Great show"
4,Good... except,"I was lucky enough to see them on this tour, the last time was the Turbo tour in '86. But enough of that. I agree with the good reviews here, my only complaint is the poor editing and cheesey split screen effects. Buy a steady cam and point it at the band. It's a concert not a music video. Rapid cuts and effects are not needed, just film the damn concert."
3,What happened to Rob??,"I'm a huge Priest fan, and was looking forward to the return of Rob Halford. I thought the CD was OK, but this DVD (Which I was really looking forward to) was a disapointment.The Picture was awesome (maybe a little too red)The sound was amazingThe band played brilliantlyWhat happened to Rob??He couldn't hit notes, used a mic-stand like a walking stick and hunched over whilst singing like he was reading the lyrics. 12 months earlier he looked and sounded awesome (Check out the DVD extras on Angel of Retribution)It was great to hear some old songs, but I really missed the Rob we've grown to love and respect."
1,one word: DISAPPOINTING,"Gosh, this is the most disappointing music DVD I ever watched. Sure, old men like Halford do not have the same on-stange-performance as in the 80s, but Halfords performance on this DVD is awful and ridiculous. Please compare Halford to Bruce Dickinson or Dave Meniketti, to name just two of the still-in-shape metal-singers-legends of the 80s! Halford looks and moves like a rusted cyborg, which would be ok, if his singing was sufficient, but it is not...not by far! Just listen to his voice performance at Electric Eye or Painkiller, you will at once throw away this DVD! Get the ""Live Vengeance 82 DVD"" instead, where he knew how to sing, how to move and the band played songs as Electric Eye at the proper speed"
3,"Not bad, but Halford is not in top form","I must admit I do not watch this DVD anymore. I mean, in terms of the image quality, the sound and the music performance this is a great DVD. Of course it has to be, coming, as it comes, from the Metal Gods. But somthing is missing, and it's hard to admit: Halford's voice. His classic high-pitched screams are no longer present and he struggles to escape narrowly from the highest notes. This is particularly noticeable during tracks such as 'Beyong The Realms Of Death' or 'Exciter' (the vocals are almost embarrasing during both tracks and it's sad to say).All in all, a good DVD, but no nearly as good as the concert recorded in Memphis in December 1982."
5,Enjoy it,Great DVD. Also great to see a concert in the comfort of your own home anytime you want.Highly recommend.
5,Great concert by the PRIEST!,Great dvd if it wouldnt freeze up in between songs.I tried playing it on my dvd xbox 360 and my ps3 just kept freezing up.If you by the dvd just to select songs its great. but if you want to watch the dvd straight through forget it.when it first came out i bought 3 copies and freezed up to.So i think everybody should pass on this dvd
3,The Metal God's Reign is Over,"I saw Priest on the previous tour when they first reunited and thought Halford must be sick. After seeing this, the reality set in, he just can't do it anymore. He walks around using the mike stand as a cane and simply can not hit the notes anymore. This is a huge decline from his solo live album Live Insurrection a few years prior. It's sad considering I've already had to watch Geoff Tate lose several steps (although not this much). Let's hope Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson can continue to bear the torch of the old great metal singers. Rob was among the best there ever was but all good things come to an end. While getting Rob back was smart from a money making standpoint, musically they would have been better keeping the much younger and capable Tim Owens. Save your money and get Electric Eye instead. I haven't seen Live Vengeance yet but that would also probably be a better choice than this."
2,Most uncomfortable item to set on,"Air venting is actually really great.Problem is sitting on it is torture.The springs leave large deep marks on legs and rear end,very uncomfortable to sit on.No cushion between your body and the springs.I am a long haul driver and though I would try them along with friends and we simply just can't use them and it was a total waste of our money."
3,Billy Connolly Comedy and Songs,"I expected to hear Billy Connolly as he was earlier in his career. Very disappointed. OK, but wouldn't recommend unless you know his comedy for right now. He used to be hilarious; you couldn't keep from laughing. Guess I expected too much."
3,Quite funny but only seven tracks,"Of couse in the CD age we've gotten a bit spoilt, but the fact that this came out in 1999 and has only seven tracks is a bit of a travesty.Doubly so because the material is pretty good, Scottish comedic legend Connolly swearing his way through subjects as diverse as Glasgow accents, the food chain, anecdotal stories of growing up in Glasgow and musical tastes all in his engaging and rambling style.If you can score it cheap this is a good buy, though my preference would be for the Live 1995 as it has more verve and is taken from the mans tour of Australia in that year and therefore feels more coherent as a release."
3,Not quite worth the wait,"After reading ""The Passionate One,"" which I loved, I quickly bought all the Connie Brockway books I could find and settled in to wait for ""The Reckless One"" to be published. However, I was disappointed to find that this book is not among her best. I admired the twisting plot--shady pasts, overbearing relatives, jail break, betrayal, false names, treasure hunting, fake and real ghosts--but I felt the plot overshadowed the characters' romance. Favor and Raine were so busy getting from A to B that they never developed a true spark."
2,Never got going!,"This book was sort of a ho-hum for me. I never got into the characters. THey seemed sort of flat. Raine was okay, but Favor just didn't click. Maybe it was the mood I was in when I read it, but it was sort of boring."
2,Not the same color as the 3rd gen (RED) Nano,"I bought this as a gift for someone with a 3rd generation Nano. Unfortunately the On Stage Micro I received from Amazon was the old red color of the 2nd Generation Nano. I wouldn't be supprised if that's why it sells for half the price of the other colors.Its not a big deal if you're not using it with a 3nd gen red iPod Nano, but it just looked like a knock-off since the reds didn't match.The packaging only had pictures of the 2nd gen Nano on it."
1,why??????,"i just recieve them and im really, really sad...the volume really sucks and you have to turn off the equalizer of your ipod if not the sound is terrible... distorsion is the correct word.the price should be of 25 no kiddini feel sorry for the guys who spend 100 bucks for this ...dont lose your time and money."
5,Dont get misled by the size,"This product packs a solid sound in a small exterior. It looks great on bed side table and a great to listen to bed side slow music. Although, a few occasions when I have listened at high volume, I was quite satisfied."
2,Tiny speakers = tiny sounds,"Please do not expect big sounds to come out of these two (1"") speakers. I got this as a gift from a friend, so I am not defending a purchase here. The clarity of the sound with this JBL micro, the design, and portability is the only reason I gave it a 2-star rating, but what good is all that if I can't enjoy the music the way I want to.At best this micro is suitable only for office use."
1,Don't bother,"Whatever this book teaches you to do, it's not meditation and definitely not transcendental. Calling this TM is like calling an ""air guitar"" player a musician. Save your money and go for the real thing, it's well worth it."
1,cannot learn TM from a book,"As I learned TM 37 years ago, it became clear why it could not be learned from a book. It is totally simple, but each person is unique and has different ways of not keeping it simple! As Maharishi noted, your teacher should take some interest in you, which of course, an author is not. (Lots of things we cannot learn from books. That's why schools have teachers.)"
1,simplistic,"You can't learn TM from a book and to give people the idea that you can just shows ignorance of it. It requires careful step by step instruction from a teacher over a period of days. The teachers take courses lasting months, hundreds of hours of video and training sessions so that they will know everything that could possibly be need to be said to the students to guide them into the proper practice. The book is really a disservice more than a service."
1,Not recommended,"He writes well enough, and he tries to be objective, but he clearly doesn't have a deep understanding of what he is writing about. If he did, he wouldn't give instructions for meditating. Meditation is not something you learn from a book. That's not the tradition, and for very good reasons."
1,Boring speaker,"This has to be most boring speaker I have ever seen as mentioned by another reviewer. I purchased two of his DVDs but after watching this one I decided to return the other one(GROW! Ten Strategies for Maximizing your Leadership Potential), he has no energy what so ever. People looked like they were not interested at all in his seminar. He has no sence of humor. I just simply DO NOT understand how he has done hundreds of seminars around the country. Just horrible do not waste your money."
2,jeff,Boring speaker but uses leadership theories of the great leaders. Was going to use in class but students will fall a sleep.
5,Exactly What I Needed,"With a small yard, I really don't need or want the hi-tech garden tools. This simple edger helps me maintain the grass fairly easily."
3,Fair to middling,"Reasonable price. The blade would not turn well so I had to take some needle nose pliers and bent the guides back some. They were scrubbing against the blade. Beware that using this tool will result in severe sweating, stiff back, and sore muscles. If you are not use to manual labor buy electric. Unless you have a small area to cover. My driveway is about 35' in length and it took me 30 minutes per side."
1,Game Would Not work,the day i got the game i played it for a hr and it`s my fav game dont get me wrong but when i left to go to work and come home to play it the game would not work in my ps2 i tried cleaning the game multiple times i even took my ps2 apart to clean out any dust or anything and once i put the game back it it still wouldnt work im very highly upset with the product and i want my money back this is my favorite game and i feel like since i spent money on it it should work so i been having the game for almost a month now trying to get it to work and it still wouldnt work
5,It's The Beatles...enough said,"Item was received promptly and in great condition. Vinyl will always be the best way to ""listen"" to music. The Beatles on vinyl...PERFECTION."
3,"Not enough history on Eminem, too much focus on culture","I just finished reading this book and I thought that it was well written from start to finish. Unfortunately, I did not get the content I was looking for. I was looking mainly for what Eminem did in the past and what he intends to do in the future. The book I would say was only 2/5ths that. The rest was focusing on hip-hop history. Chapter after chapter was the same stuff over again, but focusing on a different artist of hip-hop. Sometimes there was long stretches of pages that seemed to have no end, while not even mentioning eminem. If your looking for a book on hip-hop culture, this is a good one. If you want a book that shows the life and times of eminem, this book only counts as 2/5ths."
4,More on culture than Eminem,"This book is more focused on the hip-hop culture than Eminem. It does have some history of Eminem, but not enough for hard-core Eminem fans like myself, since most Eminem fans out there already know about Eminem's life thanks to biorythem: the old MTV biography show, and also stories told by Emimem himself.It does follow Eminem to 8 Mile, and his struggles coming up into the rap world as a white MC, of course it was hard then, and for some it is still hard for some white MC's out there.Now Bozza explains about the history of hip-hop and the culture throughout the book, and this is a good book to read for anyone older who want to understand hip-hop culture for what it is, and also some stuff about the controversal rapper himself. Nothing really major since most hard-core Eminem fans know about their favorite MC. A somewhat good book, but I just wish Bozza contreated more on Eminem than the hip-hop culture itself."
1,"Should be titled ""Rap History""","Not a whole lot of information about Eminem in this book. I made it about one third of the way through before I started lightly skimming the pages looking for ""interesting"" points. This book bounces around a lot and at times completely diverts from the title topic all together. Absolutely nothing of interest regarding Eminem in this book for me.If you are interested in some very basic information regarding rap ""history"" written in a long drawn out boring way, then this is the book for you. I personally didn't bother to finish reading it. Luckily, I didn't pay for this one."
3,Eminem Bio ?,"This book is a semi-Bio of Eminem. I think a person looking for the history on Hip-Hop, would get more insite on that, than I did of Eminem. Every now and then, he author would fill in 3 or 4 pages, giving you a little history on Eminem, but overall it kept slipping back into Hip-Hop History, and Culture. If you looking for a true Bio of Eminem, this big only gives a small supply."
2,2 stars purely for the photos,"After getting this book for Christmas, I was really looking forward to reading it, but kept putting it off. And guess what? I hated it. OK, I suppose I was expecting more of a biography about Eminem. This went into what happened before Eminem came onto the scene, including talking about Elvis, and more hip-hop music. You do however have some good photos, and some interviews with Eminem, as the interviewer travelled about with him. These were good, but there was too much inbetween the good bits, to warrant a higher rating. I will admit also, that I ended up skipping A LOT of pages, until I was skipping so many pages, that I gave up altogether, just after the second set of photos.Don't go out and buy this, seriously, it is not worth it. I definitely want a new, proper Eminem biography."
3,Big words,"As a 32 year old WOMAN Eminem Fan, I cant wait to get my hands on anything EM. I read this book in 24 hours. I agree with the other reviews that said that there was a lot of cultural history that leads to the Eminem Revolution, which got really boring. The thing that really bothered me about the book was the use of ""misogynist"" throughout to describe Em. Anyone that has REALLY listened to Eminem would know that misogynist (a severe hatred for women) is not what he is about and is just the author's attempt to sum up Eminem in one word. Pick another word - like genius or innovative!!!"
2,"Outdated fashions, not very contemporary","I'm amazed that this book was published in 2004 since the styles in here are more from the 1980s and 90s (oversized silky bows, dull pastels, etc). The fabric rose bouquet, garter, and shoe bows look incredibly tacky. I don't consider myself ultra modern but this book has few things that look similar to many other recent bride and do-it-yourself books. If you are anxious to see what is inside I recommend you check it our from your library, like I did, and not bother purchasing it. Many of the projects in here require sewing knowledge. Of all the projects in the book I would only consider making one (the flower girl basket)."
5,Powerful and ripping!!!!,"""Pincushion"" and for particular ""Breakaway"" are great openers of a brilliant longplayer. ZZ-Top are back on top with this wonderful rock-masterpiece."
5,Good rockin ' blues cd,Its a solid 4 but Im giving it a 5 to bring up the rating because of the other only review by that clown Gary Fredrick that gave it a 1.Is it any wonder?Check out all his reviews which are all negative.Back to the cd.Alot of good blues guitar licks.Definitely worth the purchase.
2,Their Style Wears A Bit Thin,"I had a decent impression on this CD upon the first couple of listens. However, over time this collection of tunes seemed quite drab as most of the songs just sound a like. Pincushion, Lizzard Life, and possibly the title track offer some catchy riffs. However, over the course of fifty plus minutes, little new is explored. I respect ZZTop for attempting to return to their blues/rock roots and opposed to putting out another synthesizer based recording. However, the energy level is not what it was when thee guys first stsarted out, so all that one has with this CD is a plodding sluggish collection of basic three chord rock tunes."
4,Business as usual by ZZ-Top!,"After years definitifely on top in it's field of music this album shows once again why! If the record runs and if you like to do, do not hesitate to check out other thinks than just listening. To do so is not an unfriendly act to the Band. That's because ZZ-Top's outstanding music goes straightforward as ever, is always on track and rock's & swing's even you are standing on top of a ladder for wall-painting. But be careful. Your feet a/o body should rock just gentle. Remember, the uppermost platform of a ladder is not really a dance-floor. Congratulation to a great R&R Band from the U.S. Good stuff, no doubt: 4 stars."
1,ZZ Boring Top,"ZZ Top is so stuck in the 80's Afterburner days. This is nothing but same tired sound they sold out with in the 80's. Synth driven heavy overdubbed. Billy Gibbons says he loves "" techno "" rock and this is more of the same being repackaged as rock. All sounds like Legs, Gimme Your Lovin', etc. I grew up loving these guys, I've moved on, they haven't."
2,Should Be Called Re-Recycler.....,"The same old riffs and same processed music. Return to form? What form is that? The low-down natural blues rock sound of ""Tres Hombres"" & ""Fandango"" or the synthesized, electronic ""transistorized"" sound of more recent vintage albums like ""Afterburner"" & ""Recycler""? When is ZZ finally gonna go back to the tube amps and the real drum kit? This release is even a step below the worn sounding ""Recycler"" album.This is a purchase for diehard ZZ Top fans only. Newcomers are best to start with the new 2 cd set ""Rancho Texicano"", then work their way thru the ZZ Top catalog from there."
1,Overrated...,"This is not a classic. ""Cream"" is the only good song I found here..the rest of the album is filled with skits...Dont buy this."
5,mo of a 4.5,"This is another classic lp from hip hops most well known group.This was the album that got wu tang there top spot . The best song on the album definetly being cream , it should be in every collection."
4,Classic Gangsta Rap,"Wu Tang's debut Cd from 1993 was really good and clearly a landmark for gangsta rap. The sample's where original and the 7 mc's were all talented young men with good lyrics new idea's and cool nick names + they all had very diffrent personalities and diffrent flows, something that the rap scene really needed back then, ""Wu"" underground took gangsta rap to new hights and commerial success. There are many good tracks here like ""Wu tang aint nothing to f*ck with"" ""Cream"" ""Can It Be All So Simple"" and ""protect ya neck"" also ""Tearz"" is a good one. The songs are full with cool beats & sounds which are filled with martial arts metaphors. After this album they became one of the most popular and most influentual rap groups out there and also helped other emerging bands make it mainstream with their raw but still funny and fresh sound, unfortunately their solo career's haven't been as positive but this is a good album too look back at."
5,Landmark Album,"This CD revolutionized rap for the better. Few artists like the Wu, Nas, Dr. Dre, and the Roots can say the same.peace"
5,Wu-Tang Forever!!!,This is by far the best wu-tang album out. It is their most focused effort. I think it is a lot better than wu-tang forever becaused it seems like they put a lot more effort in this one. This cd put the wu in the spotlight and really made them who they are. If you don't have this go out and get it!
5,Easily One of the Ten Greatest Rap CDs EVER!,"36 Chambers is also one of the most important. It brought the rap world new views on knowledge, ethnic relations, education, and the world in general. This CD is also very underpriced because it has (so far) infinite listening value. Its over half a decade old and is still untouchable for most as far as an aspirational apex for an LP. I can listen to the first track through the last track everyday and not get sick of it and zealously enjoy it. I can't really ask for much more as a listener."
5,Wu-Tang's Best.,"The first cd is always the best in most cases, and it is for Wu-tang, its the RZA, GZA, Ghostface Killa, Raekwon, Method Man, Kill Army, Cappadonna,Master Killa, Killa Priest, and U-God this cd is really good because the artist flow so good together and the lyrics are crazy, and there engergy is nuts. Wu-tang kicks so much ass."
5,DOLLA DOLLA BILL YALL!,their is not one below par track on this entire album. each member of the wu hits you hard with their hardcore style and rymes. this album is definately RZA's best work. you can put this album next to illmatic and ready to die as far as standards go. a must buy!
5,Wu Tang Clan ain't nuttin to fu*k wit,"One of my top 10 favorite rap albums, 36 chambers is a classic. This cd has 12 tracks of killa rhymes and phat beats. This album shows the talent each member of the Wu has, and launched their own solo albums. Bottom line, if you are a rap fan, and you don't have this album, get it. Some of my favorite songs are CREAM, Method Man, Ain't Nuttin to F Wit, Shame On A Nig*a, and Bring The Ruckus."
5,GET IT,If you dont have this album you are just lame. If you dont love this album stop saying you like hip-hop. This is a no brainer. True classic from The Wu
2,Poorly Pressed Vinyl,They definitely should have made this 2 vinyls. The maximum length for a 12 inch should usually be 26 min. but Enter the Wu-tang is nearly 62 minutes long. When they pressed it all to one vinyl it ruined the signal to noise ratio and now it's too quiet and pops are the loudest thing on the record. It really is a shame because this album is classic but I guess I can't complain since I only paid $12.
3,bad vinyl.,"Amazing album. Thought it would be awesome on vinyl... too bad its a pretty bad press, and lacks any kind of depth."
5,My favorite rap cd,"This is the best of the best. This album has everything. Lyrics, beats, and different styles. All nine members are great lyricists(even ODB). The beats by RZA are rich and dark. Favorites are Bring da Ruckus, Shame on a N****, Clan in da Front, Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber, Can It Be All So Simple, Mystery of Chessboxin', Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit, C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Protect Ya Neck, and Tearz. Thats basically the whole cd. That's how good it is. If you dont have this, then your collection is uncomplete. RIP ODB!!!"
5,Greatest rap album ever,"Wu Tang Clan is the best rap group ever. This album came out when rap meant something and wasnt watered down like it is today. All nine members have a style all there own and they all blend well into the songs. I love the production from the RZA, he is one of the most under rated rap producers out there. I wish he'd get more credit for his work but oh well. There is not a weak track on this cd. I know the words to ever single song on the cd. A must for fans of real rap. Not todays rap because there might be some good rap out there (and thats a big might), its not as good as it was in 93 and 94."
5,Hip-Hop Classic,"This is no doubt a must have for any real rap fan! And if you don't have this album you cannot call yourself a real Wu-Tang fan. The production on this album is great, the rapping on this album is great, the lyrics on this album are great. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this album. With hits like METHOD MAN, Protect Ya Neck, and C.R.E.A.M. you cant go wrong. Everyone needs this Wu album, and if you dont have if you dont have a real cd collection. Every song on this album is at least 4.5 stars."
5,"What more can I say, another classic rap masterpiece.","Every song on here is worth at least a 4.5 or 5. This is a young Wu-Tang at their prime when they were angry, gritty, tough, lyrically great, and just wanted to play rough and have a fun time. Though some fans might prefer Wu-Tang Forever, nothing will top this one. Sadly they kinda sold out on The W & Iron Flag, the hits from those are still pretty good though. Back to ETW36CBS. Everyone's heard the 2 big hits C.R.E.A.M and M.E.T.H.O.D. Man, I believe, anyone who listened to rap back in 93-95 will instantly recognize them.Best songs: C.R.E.A.M, Can it All be so Simple, Shame on a [...], Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin' Ta [...] Wit, Da Mystery of Chessboxin', Protect ya Neck & M.E.T.H.O.D. Man."
4,This is rap!,Now this is one the classic albums. It's Wu-Tang's best album without a doubt. Everyone goes just hard on the track with verse after verse. I would put it as 5 stars but what brought it down is that a few songs are censored! And it even says Explicit!
5,Perfect Album,This album is my favorite album of all time. Every track you can listen to from beginning to end. The whole clan spits classic verses over RZAs genius production. Each member showcases their lyricism and flows on this album. I can listen to this album all the time without it aging. This album will change your view on hip hop forever. Whenever I listen to music ill always go back to the 36 Chambers. GET THIS ALBUM NOW!WU-TANG FOREVER
5,their second best,"Enter the Wu Tang was the best album ever until Wu Tang Forever.Track1-10/10 best song after cream Inspectah deck tears it up and so does ghostfaceTrack2-10/10 ODB at his bestTrack3-7/10 GZA solo could have been betterTrack4-10/10 One ghostface is seriousTrack5-8/10 Good song but cream is betterTrack6-10/10 One of my favorites Mastah Killa takes the cakeTrack7-10/10 Hardcore Wu is always great especially RZATrack8-10/10 Maybe the best song everTrack9-8/10 Gangsta method man is betterTrack10-9/10 Listen to inspectah deckTrack11-10/10 This shows how real wu tang really is listen to the Rza speak knowledgeTrack12-7/10 Its the same as track 4 with a different beat. They could have put more mastah killa and u god in here.Overall this is the ranks as high as illmatic, and ready to die, but is not as good as wu tang forever."
1,Disappointing,"Rap-hop sensation ""WU TANG CLAN"" 's sophomore sensation is here. For this situation, it is evident that without sustainable interest, ( for example, these cantopop singles ), it would be difficult to analyzed.First foremost, many techniques that have been applied, were also applied in the CANTOPOP SCENE, who were they who invented these rap-hop ideas and vocal techniques. This is including the use of voice, to conveying words, and telling about their stories/feelings.To return these points, it would be a dishonor, after I have won the argument. This is a unique idea to failing."
2,Yo brother Wu Tang best Tang since Orange Tang,"Wu Tang brings out the super honky in everyone. I mean it is so fhat its bigger than a honkasaurus. Once I started listening to this music I started drinking orange tang instead of kool aid. Yo man if you want to be down with the king you got to buy this disco compacto, thats spanish for I'm a honkey, and be prepared for the zangy, tangy super honk experience. Peace out my Tangy Clan"
1,absolute trash,"this, in my eyes, is one of the worst cd's i own, and probably will remain the worst until i break it."
5,36 Chambers of Death Kid.....,"There aren't words to describe how important this CD was for hip-hop. Its INCREDIBLE! If was released for the first time TODAY, SEVEN YEARS LATER, it would still be incredible. Its is definatley one of, if not, the best Hip-Hop Albums of all time."
3,Great album; bad quality on vinyl,"This album is fantastic but the vinyl pressing does nothing to showcase that, which is a shame. The sound quality of the pressing is bad; it's very muddy and lacks clarity.The album itself is a 5/5, but the sound quality on vinyl is 2/5 at best."
5,TRULY THE GENISIS OF MODERN RAP,"YOU CANT CALL YOURSELF A HIP HOP FAN IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS ALBUM,BETTER COP IT SOON"
4,Real talent,"This is an early work by a writer of enormous talent, perhaps too heavy-handed in the desire to maintain a negative atmosphere. Nevertheless, his promise is tremendous. The quality of translation, always a problem between English and Chinese, is very good also and captures the mood and general technique of the original."
4,"""Rice"" stuns and captivates.","Five Dragons, a starving refugee from China's countryside, finds a job in the big stinking city. Working only for rice, he is disgusted and appalled by the family's greed and selfishness. After marrying a daughter to get into the family, his evil apathetic nature drives the shop owner to his death. He eventually marries the other daughter after the first forsakes him, joins a gang, and kills people just for spite. The children from his marriages grow up just as envious and self-serving as the first generation. With his wealth,made from illegal smuggling and extortion, he buys his entire childhood village in the country. However, on the train ride back to the country, he succumbs to a particularly nasty venereal disease, never again to see his true home."
4,Awesome fun for evry1,"I loved this movie! It's PG-13, but lots of kids think it's really funny too. Ther are some great actors and actresses (including all the kids!) in this movie. Jack Black is so amazingly talented and funny. Everyone should see School of Rock."
3,Sound fades in and out on DVD,"I played this dvd last night and had to keep adjusting the volume up and down as it faded in and out. I searched on the internet and found others with the same problem. I've got the Pioneer DVD / SACD / DVD-Audio player so it's certainly up on the state of art. Don't know what's going on. Here's link to others with problem, maybe replacement is in order if it's some copy protection?http://www.film-411.com/messages/8037.shtml"
3,A funny movie,"I just rented this movie because Ikept hearing about how funny thismovie is.This was not the funniestmovie I have ever seen,but it hasit's funny moment's.I am not a Jack Black fan butI feel this is his best moviehe ever had a starring role in."
4,"An entertaining, fun movie.","This is a good movie for anyone over 8! Between the great classic rock songs, very talented young children, and Jack Black's humor, you just can't go wrong. I laughed throughout the movie and was never bored (as I usually get during any movie). If you like classic rock, you definitely should see this movie just for Black's rock-history lesson. If you like to laugh and enjoy a 'cute' movie every now and then, you definitely will be happy with this one! As for the reviewer who compared this to ""Lost in Translation,"" to put it bluntly, ""Lost in Translation"" was BORING compared to ""School of Rock."""
3,endearing,"Lighthearted, warmly entertaining fare about a ne'er-do-well loser (Jack Black) who masquerades as a substitute teacher and ends up turning his class into a rock band, all the while finding that he is good at something as he bolsters the self-confidence of his charges and really teaches everyone (including himself) about teamwork. He thinks quickly, acts on his feet-managing to keep the rock band project afloat despite suspicions about his ""unorthodox"" teaching methods, diverting the principal's attention from his true intentions while preparing his students for a talent show. A good story about coming into your own, accepting who you are, even when the results are not what you expected."
5,Don't Listen to Those Haters!,"Ah, Jack Black. His movies can be pretty crappy, but he always makes them seem like the funniest movies you could ever watch (even though you know its not). But not this movie. This movie actually IS incredibly funny, and an absolute joy to watch.What amazed me the most though, were it's surprisingly likeable kids (who, more often than not, are incredibly irritating in most movies) who give that joyous feel while watching it. The director was wise enough not to make them sitcom style smart asses, and they give the movie a nice, genuine feel. They're even-gasp!- funny! Not to say its really their movie, no, no, the show stealer is Jack, who's charisma turns what has the potential to be one of the stupidest movies ever, into something truly enjoyable. (He sure as hell better, it was written directly FOR him). Really, though, go see this movie. Good laughs, good music, funny kids, and a just plain good times. And, come on, its Jack Black we're talkin' about here!"
2,C+,"Jack Black is great, of course, and the kids are semi-cute -- but, other than that, this is a really bad movie. Joan Cusak and Sarah Silverman are given nothing funny to say and are therefore not funny (see how that works?). Lots of wasted talent here...."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed I thought that the dvd would include deleted scenes like all other dvds do.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,Movie was ridiculous. Had a hard time giving it 1 star. Yah right! Like a sub could pull off having a full band in a classroom & noboby but the kids in the class would know what's going on.Jack Black has no talent or charisma for that matter.He's scary looking & creepy.This movie reccomended thumbs up by Ebert & Roeper has stopped me from taking their recommendations seriously. Bottom line don't waste your time or money unless you are about eight years old & than you might like it!
4,Just a fun movie that we enjoyed as a family,"We enjoyed watching this as a family. The kids enjoyed watching the kids stepping out of the roles of being just kids and having a lot of fun. Jack Black is who he is and we find that pretty funny, but we can see how others might not. And I think Joan Cusack makes everything she is in even better.The kids in the class Jack Black is subbing for are all charming and do a fine job being transformed from a bunch of preppy uniforms into a rock band (of sorts). Of course the premise is implausible and every objection you can raise about the reality of this film is probably true. But I would reply that you might benefit from lightening up and just having fun. I know we did. We laughed and we enjoyed saying, ""Yeah, RIGHT!"" at the more ridiculous plot points. This isn't supposed to be a serious movie. It was just a fun time and you will likely enjoy it if you can get in the same mindset."
4,"""How many of you know what a hangover is?""...","Jack Black is hysterical in this movie, but better than that, the kids are really great! This movie is fun, and our whole family likes it....long live rock, long live JB!!"
3,Very Entertaining,"My wife and I are always looking for a good movie which our 9 and 12 year old girl and boy will enjoy, and which we approve. A review in Netflix mentioned this movie glorifies the rock and roll industry too much, and will influence children to leave their core studies. My children could see this was not reality, and the movie does not end giving the impression these children dropped out of school, or turned rebellious. Jack Black is so funny and entertaining. It is great to see how they progress to the big concert. There is some mild bad language that we would be upset to hear our children using, but they sure know the difference, and how ignorant it sounds to use those words. Long live the school of rock!!!"
