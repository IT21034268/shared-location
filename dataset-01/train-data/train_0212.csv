4,The Real Denver,"I confess! I never read the book! BUT on cable I just saw the autobiographical movie called Back Home Again starring Chad Lowe as John. From the reviews I read, this movie was just the filmed version of the book. To see John as screwd up as the rest of us was delicious to behold because I always wondered what he was really like. As a result, I respect and honor the man more because behind the musician was a human being. John Denver was, is, and always will be, my hero."
5,We need this book re-published and on KINDLE!!!!!!!,"I LOVE this book and JD!!! It's a crying shame that this isn't in print anymore. It also needs to be put on Kindle. I purchased this from a second hand through Amazon and the book itself wasn't in good shape at all. But it's an excellent book anyway, written by John himself. I really wish Amazon would do something and get ahold of that publisher and get this book back in print and on KINDLE!!!! More young people need to know about this great man. It's like everyone wants to forget about him.....why???? Thank God for YouTube that fans keep his memory going......."
4,Not enough of what we want to know,"Having been a fan of John's music for over 20 years, I expected more from his autobiography, then what I got.It was interesting reading, and his honesty was refreshing; however, I was looking for more in depth writing on the various songs he had written.Few of them were written about it any detail.His second marriage to Cassandra Delaney was glossed over, in my opinion, as was his relationship with his children.I suppose it is hard to cram one's life into a 200 page book, but then again a marriage and children would seem to be more important than EST training.Still, overall, a decent read.I remain a fan of the man and his music. May he rest in peace."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER,"Don't usually read screenplays but I saw the movie so many times (Susan Sarandon is my favorite actress, I like Harvey Keitel too) that I could picture it as I went along. A few scenes were changed in the movie but not many. The dialogue is laugh out loud funny. Darryl, Thelma's husband, is such a jerk, just as portrayed in the film version. Most of the characters are faithful to the screenplay. I love the symbolic ending-two women flying off...and leaving it all behind."
2,Not what it what it said it was.,"I believe the claims to fit both a side post and top post battery are very misleading and inaccurate. Since I live out in the country, I bought this thinking I could install it without additional parts. As well, the fused link defeats the purpose of a battery disconnect. When I tried to install this on a side post battery there are in sufficient parts to complete the installation. There is no way to connect the cable to the other end of the switch. To use this I had to travel to town (I live 50 miles from town) and get nuts and bolts ($2.20) to get it to work. I you install the fused link, then you still get battery drain from the on-board electronics and within a short week (at least in a GMC pickup) the battery is dead. I do NOT recommend the purchase of this switch for a side post battery."
2,Brittle Clamp,"Product appears to be made of heavy metal however it is brittle when I attempted to tighten it so it would be secure on the post it broke in half at the bolt. Overall the product appears well made, however if you decide to purchase be extremely careful when securing it to the battery."
3,The one and only Old Persian grammar available.,"This book offers a great many things, but is lacking in practicality. The book offers a good amount of information and detail of the language and does compare the language with others. Kent shows a good knowlege of Latin and Greek, yet his representation of New Persian in the comparisons are, at times, very inaccurate. Kent relies on the transcription solely and admittedly changes some of the characters with others that usually represent completely different sounds, yet his key is not an easily understood one. His treatment of the grammatical features are a bit disorganized at times."
3,Analysis of the diamond black market by the spymaster.,"Back in the 1950's, the smuggling of diamonds from Africa took on the proportions of a James Bond novel. In this non-fiction account of those times, Fleming outlines the successful counterintelligence effort which was used to bring the rampart smuggling under control.A bit dry, but Fleming fans will appreciate the Bondesque style the story is recounted in."
4,VERY INTERESTING,This book by Flemming is interesting and well written. I like it because it is non-fiction and is a true story (unlike his Bond novels). A real Flemming fanatic will love this wonderful book. I rate it a 4 star book and a piece well done.
3,Not their best work.,"I know this band has many terrific songs, I've heard many of them on Youtube, but apparently none of them are on this album. I honestly had a hard time forcing myself to listen to all of the tracks. The CD wasn't bad, just a let down for a guy who knows that this group can do so much better."
5,What a completely cool book,"This is a terrific little book. Weinstein starts with the basics--the principles of what makes paper airplanes fly, and the principles of paper-folding that will be utilized throughout the book--and thenproceeds to show in perfect detail how to build nearly three dozen unique paper airplanes. Even the simplest ones are far more impressive than anything you are likely to have created on your own--and they fly a lot farther, too. As for some of the more complex ones--well, it's almost not even fair to call them ""paper airplanes,"" as that doesn't connote the level of intricate detail and genuine beauty in one of Weinstein's finished paper fighter jets.I thought this would be a cool book for my ten-year-old son. I was wrong: it's a cool book for ME, his 40-yer-old father! Which is not to say that my son couldn't follow all the instructions--they are laid out simply, in both text and accurate diagrams. It's just that I'm having too much fun...Highly recommended."
5,These really fly!,"I have a few airplane books, and overall these fly the best. If you buy one book for planes, this is the one."
4,Illustrations to add a nostalgic touch,"The early years of the twentieth century were a much simpler time in terms of technology, relationships and activities. Everyday events were captured in the form of drawings and these drawings were published in women's magazines. The illustrations in this collection were taken from those magazines and are now in the public domain. Therefore, they can be used to add a nostalgic flavor to graphic projects. People are depicted doing many things, doing farm and household chores, celebrating holidays, and modeling clothes. With so many different high quality images, you can no doubt find something for your project in this collection."
1,Never got it to work,"I had the same installation problems. THe program would install and I could open it, but nothing worked. I couldn't play any audio file. I just got the same error message that the file could not be opened. Emailing customer support gets very old. I tried to jump through the hoops but could never fix the problem. I'll likely give it to my sister for Christmas and hope she has better luck with it on her PC"
1,Terrible waste of time,"Shuts down in Windows XP, error report appeared 5 times. Each time I started to 'add' mp3s to project it froze and pretty much never worked again.GARBAGE!"
4,Very Good for Making CDs from LP/Tape,"I almost didn't buy this program based on the negative comments I read here. I run XP and wanted to take my old, out of print vinyls and make CDs from them. I found it to be very good for that. I just record an entire side of an album to a file, split it up into tracks visually by looking/listening to the waveform, and optionally cleaning up, enhancing the sound. I can truncate tracks if I let the record go too long. I found the process to be very easy, and it produced a good quality CD. I also used it to rip MP3s from CD so I could combine a number of audio CDs onto a single data CD (I just got the Cambridge Soundworks table-top radio CD player, that support MP3s; love it). There were a few small user interface things that I thought could have been better. Like automatically putting my ripped MP3s into a folder hierarchy based on artist and album title. But all in all, I'm very pleased so far."
2,XP upgrade?,"This software is costly if you plan to just rip tracks for MP3 in or out.Cakewalk Pyro. First you will find that the Gearlang DLL file hasn't been up dated to run with XP multiuser windows software, which XP has been out on the market for years. The dll file library is not a shared library which means only one user can rip CD'S that user is the admin. of that computer; so everyone else will have access to the admin's personal files while using this program. Be aware of the limits of this software. If you really need the bells and whisles it might be a value to you? NOTE Gerland DLL. file 95/98/NT (NO) 2000 or XP update."
4,No Problem Mon,"I dunno what people's problem is, maybe they are using Windows 98 or something. But for Data back-up and music compilation, it couldn't be simpler or more reliable (so far -it's been a few months). So, what's the Problem?"
3,Not that easy to use,I bought this as an upgrade from Pyro 2003 which worked very well. I found the 2004 version to be less user friendly so far and not any faster than Pyro 2003. At least it works better than the Roxio CD Creater 5 did! I mostly burn CDs from MP3 and LPs and it works fairly well for that.
1,Didn't work,"Installed, following directions precisely. Tried to rip one track from a CD. Didn't work. Tried 5 times. Went online to obtain driver updates. Tried same CD. Didn't work. Tried a second CD -- 5 more times. Same error message.Was there any quality assurance done on this project by Cakewalk? I am seriously disappointed. I want my software to work right out of the box. This piece of junk didn't even come with a manual. You open the box and it contains a CD and a piece of paper telling you to visit Cakewalk's website. Lame, lame, lame. I don't have time to track down solutions to problems that should have been caught by Cakewalk's QA dept. Shame on you, Cakewalk."
5,PHP Potential Unleashed,"There are a lot of ways to learn a language, and PHP is a popular one because it's dynamic. If you truly want to unleash the potential of this dynamic language than you need to get this book! Jack goes into detail and even provides scripts for hundreds of uses with the perspective of a seasoned veteran, it's easy to use and reference different sections."
2,doesn't keep what it promises,"when I saw the title I was sure it is exactly what I needed, some special tips and tricks, something that you can't find easily on the internet. But it was nothing more.The good thing is now I have some good ideas in a book and don't have to search every time online."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Please don't buy this book - even not if you are a PHP beginner. The hacks in there are for beginners and even for them it's not worth buying the book.The samples are just wrong, have security issues and are known by everyone that has ever coded seriously.So save yourself some money and buy another book, but not this one... the first O'Reilly-book that's really bad."
5,"best PHP reference I have used, bar none","I've read at least a dozen books on web development with PHP. This book is the best, by far!The good:* Excellent coverage of elegant PHP for dealing with databases and XML* Outstanding explanation of automated code generation (a must for professional PHP developers)* Description (and code implementation) of how to use design patterns with PHP. Former J2EE guys will love this.* High quality prose and clear descriptions. I did not find any grammatical or spelling errors.* Light sense of humor (without the unnecessary banter that one finds in most ""... for Dummies"" books)The bad:* Nothing.As a software developer of 10 years, I give this book my highest recommendation."
5,Filled with good ideas,"The code in this book definitely lives up to the ""hacks"" title, but that's okay because it's filled with lots of good ideas and useful snippets."
4,Ask Ol Bill is worth the price,"Dylan's new song Ask Ol Bill is as good if not better than Things Have Changed...He sings in a John Wesley Harding style...limited but nonetheless clear throated that is easy on the ear..This song just chugs along with great images worthy of the best from Dylan..There are previously released Dylan songs on this cd plus songs from other artists...Warren Zevon's Werewolf..still a hoot, the two corny country songs I just don't like...But I did not see the movie so they may bring some appropriate comic relief to the script...??? If you are Dylan fan, you gotta get this cd just for Ask Ol Bill...."
3,"Good Dylan music and Werewolves of London, what more do you need on a soundtrack?","Kicks butt, this soundtrack. Has two of my top 5 Dylan songs, ""Sweetheart like you"" and ""Lay Lady Lay"". I prefer the version of ""Girl from North Country"" Dylan did with Johnny Cash, but the one on the soundtrack is listenable. Great song from the Scorsese film ""Color of Money""--Werewolves of London, that you can hardly find anywhere else."
2,Important info left out!,"I love Lonely Planet Guides and have used them for many trips in the past, but this book was certainly not complete. One example is the lack of info on marionette shows. It's one of the most popular things to do in Prague and this book only mentions marionettes once, in a short paragraph about the history of theater in Prague. No mention on the places to see a show or what to see. Also, I have never had a travel guide that didn't mention ANYTHING about the train station in the city!! This book did not even have one piece of info on the train stations or how to find them, how to travel from other cities to Prague or how to get to other places from Prague. We had planned to go to Vienna from Prague and had no idea where the train station was, how to get to it, or how to find a train schedule. Thankfully our hotel was able to fill us in on this info. I would NOT recommend using this book as your tour guide for Prague, it isn't thorough by any means."
2,Useless Maps,"Recently purchased the 9th Edition and found the pullout maps to be useless. The text is printed in an incredibly small font. I purchased this book without seeing it first based on experience with past Lonely Planet books. Never again. Outside of the history of Prague, I found little useful about this city guide. I was better served with a map provided by the hotel and what information I could gather online. I am shifting to Frommer's."
2,Poorly organized,"As far as descriptions of sights, restaurants tours, history, etc, the information was pretty accurate. But actually being in Prague and using the book to get around to different sights and restaurants was extremely difficult.Instead of having a chapter on a specific neighborhood with everything in that neighborhood, they have a chapter on neighborhoods, then shopping, then eating, then drinking, then entertainment, etc. Having to flip to the eating section, then flip back to the neighborhood section, then flip to the map to see where it was located was very time consuming and annoying.Another thing I didn't like was that the writing on the maps was much too small. I have perfect reading vision and could barely make out the street names and numbers."
4,Great information,"I always enjoy a update Lonely Planet to any city that I am going to. Yet the place I am staying in not in the book, there is a great map to to find the location."
4,"Detailed, Helpful","My only qualm is that it isn't in full color. I may be spoiled by the other travel book I recently bought (Fodor's Paris 2011 Full-Color).Between this book and the Moon Travel Guide I also have for Prague, I would definitely say this one is more helpful and has much more content."
4,LP,"I have spent 6 days in Prague with this book and I can say this is a good tourist book for short trips. Not perfect though: the list of hotels is very weak, so better if you look for them yourself; restaurants listed as very good tend to became worse after good Lonely Planet-reviews. Otherwise this is really a nice guide with lots of useful tips."
4,This book saved my trip,"Great resource with great walking routes too (excellent directions!). When traveling I usually bring two, maybe three guide books. On this trip to Prague I brought two, and ended using this extensively, as the other book was found to be nothing more than extra weight to carry around the city.Highly recommend this book, plus one other (not fodor's). The only minus of this book was the metro map. But other than that this book is seriously dog eared, written in, and cherised as a great memoir of my trip to Prauge."
5,Very complete,"I bougyht this to start planning a trip to Prague in the spring and I thought I would have to get other books to explain specific parts, but this saved me a lot of money because it is so complete! I dont think I will need another book!I talks about the culture, the food, the history, where to stay, night life, museums, history, logistics, prices, everything. The authors really know teh city well! You can see why it is one of the top companies."
3,Arrived leaking in the plastic bag,"When it arrived it was leaking in the plastic bag. Good thing it was in that bag. It worked on some loose dowels but not all. I guess there is a limit to how much the dowel can expand with this oil, which is reasonable."
2,didn't work so great,"I have a rocking chair that was hand made in Hungary and is fitted together - no nails in the entire chair. Over time, the place where the arms connect to the back has gotten incredibly creaky. So, I got this to quiet the creak, but it didn't really work. I followed the directions and even applied it 3 times, thinking maybe it was just an extra creaky chair. But, the swel-lock never did do a good enough job. I won't be buying this again."
5,Works great!,"I have used another product like this one before, but this worked just as well and for less $$. I highly recommend Swel-lock for any wood furniture with loose joints."
5,EXCELLENT,Works well on anything you have to re handle. Make sure to fit handle snugly and coat wood wedge with Swel-Lock.
5,Great for the large or small garden,"He goes in great depth how to start a bible garden or expand on one you've already got. He includes graphs to help you plan your garden, extensive information of plants, alternatives to those that won't grow in your area or cannot be obtained. A true inspiration for our ""Bible Memorial Garden"" at our church. A must read for anyone who would like to have a bible garden or would like to grow plants found mentioned in the bible."
4,"Roslyn Gerson's ""Book - Vintage Bags & Purses""","Collectors of handbags and historical fashion items will find this a useful, comprehensive guide. Although the book was published in the mid-1990s it still packs punch: information of value. The price listings appear to have been updated in 1997. Although these may be out of date, the author's level of knowledge and the information she offers has stood the test of time. I was looking for specific data on a rare item -- and it's nicely documented in her text and photos. I purchased a used copy via Amazon.com. The delivery was quick, and the book I received was in excellent condition."
2,Love the writing. Don't love the publication.,I love Harlan Ellison's writing. Haven't read him for years and wanted to reread some of his stuff. It seems as though the publisher simply cut and pasted the contents into a new format without regard to pagination and footnotes. At least one footnote (there may be more as I am still reading) appears in the middle of the page following the reference. It's just very sloppy publishing. And why isn't Harlan bitching about this?
2,Bland,"I like Agustin Lara's tunes, but the way Solis sings them they all sound the same. He employs vibrato on every note that's held long enough to use it on, and it sounds weak and wobbly. If you want to hear the real beauty of Lara's music, go to Placido Domingo's Bajo el Cielo Espanol."
2,Left a lot to be desired,"Love GNR, would love alternative versions of their music but this is a wimpy attempt. And dont be snookered into buying both CDs -- they share a handful of the same songs. November Rain is the best of the bunch -- no duh -- it was already an orchestral piece. Very disappointed."
1,all original artist,"track number 5 - sana bukas pa ang kahapon - was originally performed by KUH LEDESMA. on this cd it is printed performed by SHARON CUNETA. If you listen to this cd it is kuh ledesma singing to sana bukas pa ang kahapon, the original artist to this song. sorry guys somebody made an error on this custom cd."
5,Good Intermediate Spanish Textbook,"I used this textbook in my intermediate Spanish class in college (SPI 201 & 202). I found the choice of vocabulary throughout the chapters to be strange, but I like the grammar explanations.Here are the chapters in this book:Preface: Bienvenidos1. Tipos y estereotipos2. La comunidad humana3. Costrumbes y tradiciones4. La familia5. Geografia, demografia, tecnologia6. El hombre y la mujer en el mundo actual7. El mundo de los negocios8. Creencias e ideologias9. Los hispanos en los Estados Unidos10. La vida moderna11. La ley y la libertad individual12. El trabajo y el ocioMy favorite part of the book were the sections on the subjunctive. I used them as a reference when I was writing my book. If you want to look up the sections on the subjunctive in this book, bookmark the following pages: 120, 166, 197, 224, & 241.Brandon Simpson"
2,never again,The person did not respond to emails. It took way to long to receive the book. And if anyone else is thinking about doing business with this person I strongly suggest against it.
1,Dangerous product and horrible quality,"I uploaded a picture of what happened to the product after only 10 minutes of putting it together. The post came unhinged, exposing extremely sharp staples. There was no stress placed on the post to make it break apart like that. The overall quality of this product is horrible. I'm just glad I was home and my cats didn't play with the post after the post fell apart exposing the sharp staples. I'd give this 0 stars if that was an option. Avoid this product at all costs."
5,Scratching post,"We have two small kittens, and this is the perfect size and height for them to ""attack"" - it keeps them away from the furniture"
3,Flexrake Deluxe Carpet Scratch Post 1047,"I have two cats, and neither one use this scratching post much. they like it when I put catnip sprinkled around on it. That is the only time they pay attention to it!"
5,The cats love it.,The cats love it and if they do who can complain? Its a little ruff on my nails though! LOL! Just kidding! Its compact and does what it needs to do and is holding up to my two ferocious mutant cats extremely well.
2,too big/too small,We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only. I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
3,"Good for strollers and swings, but not car seats","As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not for car seats. However, it doesn't have to do with crash testing issues. The technician who installed my car seat told me to never ATTACH anything to my car seat (including toys) that didn't come with the seat, and the way these headrests fit, that is considered to be attached. The reason had to do with how your baby will fit in the seat. It's the same reason you are not supposed to put your baby in a car seat when he or she is extremely bundled up- you end up securing the clothing more than the baby. The technician did recommend the rolled blanket idea- the blankets will not cause harm to your baby in a crash, and they do not interfere with how the baby fits in the seat at all.I am using mine in the stroller and his swing. It works well for these items. I give it three stars because it is not totally useless."
2,"Great Idea, But...","I got this for my Evenflo Travel System (Portabout 5) and it was not very good. It just looked way too bulky. The directions from the travel system say to use a rolled up receiving blanket for neck support. So, i think I will just try that or the baby Boppy."
1,Never used it.,"It is not recommended that you use anything in your carseats that is not provided by the maker of the carseat, so this was a waste. If you need support buy a boppy neck support - much better!"
1,This should be taken off the market.,"This is a hazard. We were told by a certifed carseat person that it is a danger, it could slip behind the babys neck close off the babys' airway. It should be taken off the market."
2,Doesn't help her head,"I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns. This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward. Also, my car seat came with one."
1,Think about using them in car seats...,"In my childbirth class, the state car seat technician came in and explained to the class how to properly use infant car seats. She said that you shouldn't use any type of headrest that did not come with the car seat as it has not been tested and approved as safe. Instead, she recommended using rolled up receiving blankets on the sides of the baby to keep him/her from flopping over."
4,a must have for new mom's,"l'm a new mom my son is six week's old and l use this Double headrest on the swing, bouncer, carseat.. and it work's prettygood, l think every new mom should have one cause it helps thebaby's head not to go everywhere."
1,Didn't work right for me,"I'm not sure why but it didn't work for me. My son's head still flopped around; it wasn't deep enough. I use the ""wings"" instead, they work great!"
1,What crash testing means,"If I could have used zero stars, I would have been more accurate.It's true that after market items like this HAVE NOT BEEN CRASH TESTED and are therefore NOT recommended for use with your car seat. The alternative IS to use rolled up towels or diapers AROUND your baby's head or body. NOT BEHIND. The problem with these headrests is that they add material behind the heads and bodies. This added material increases the distance your baby will travel during a crash. This isn't good. Your car seat wasn't tested with extra material. That's why they aren't recommended."
2,Not needed,"I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower. I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest. Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat. Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury. The product may be a fine one, but I found an ""extra"" one to be unnecessary."
2,Not for carseats,"Although the product description says it can be used in carseats, according to the NHTSA, anything that was not crash tested in your particular car seat compromises its ability to protect your child! If you really feel the need to have head support, roll some light receiving blankets and put them around the sides of the head. Nothing should be behind baby or between the front of baby and the straps. Some carriers and carseats do have supports included with them. They are considered safe as they were tested with the seat.I give this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it is great for use in swings and bouncers, especially for tiny babies."
5,They are still on of the best bands around in Tex-mex,"After all these years La Mafia is still the best with Oscar,Leonard and Mando leading the way for the others they still have a style that no one can come close to. This new CD entitled Euforia just proves that they are one of the greatest if not the greatest bands around."
4,So far so good.,I bought and installed this belt over a month and it has been working fine since. I have not had any problems with it at all. It also was shipped and arrived just as it said it would be.
2,w,Not the movie I thought it was. OK for what it was. I would expect to find this on very late night TV
1,KILLS CUTTINGS - Don't buy from ALL STAR HYDRO INC,"I saw such great reviews that I had to try this gel. I put it on some new and recent cuttings and it burned them badly. The cuttings started to die within 24 hours. I recut the cuttings, and they would not restart. The rooting chemical permanently damaged them and they would not restart. I threw them out.NOTE: I tried the gel on several kinds of plants and all were permanently burned after taking in the gel at the end of the cutting.Some of the cuttings grewmold at the tips.I wrote the company, ALL STAR HYDRO INC, about what happened and a refund. They never bothered to respond to me.DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY, it will KILL your cuttings."
1,Rootech kills clones,"I tried several cuttings with rootech, killed every one every time. Plain water or cheap powder rooting hormone worked in almost every case. Maybe I got a bad jar of it, but after 3 rounds of 100 percent death, I'm throwing out my $30 jar of the junk."
1,I Fell Asleep,I fell asleep trying to read this so called book. Think of the trees who died for what? Gary Dobry's vanity?
1,Kind of a Hack,"Gary Dobry is certainly a boxer. He also seems to have a gift for convincing people that he writes on par with Bukowski or Miller, when the truth is that he pales in comparison. A visit to his website shows that he trained Danny Bonaduce for the 'Celebrity Boxing Match' show on Fox a while back. How can someone write about artistic integrity and living the 'Continental Lifestyle' while nonetheless perpetuating CELEBRITY BOXING? Don't be fooled by the pseudo-artistic posturing. The fact is, Dobry's writing reflects his lack of originality. This book is dry, boring, and unoriginal."
2,You might want to reconsider,"If you really want this book, spring for the Princeton Architectural Press larger format hardcoverfor this bargain edition the format is too small and the image quality is poorly reproduced."
4,like it,"like it. fits my decor in the kitchen. it's modern and unique. the only problem is that it doesn't hold a lot of knives, but it's a very unique product"
3,disappointed,This was supposed to be a like new book. The corner of the cover is ripped off. The book smells like it has been in a moldy basement for years. The pages of the book are yellowed but in fine condition. The spine has never been broken.
2,Not for children,"This book was suggested in a home-school catalog as a book to help my children understand the customs at the time of Jesus' birth. It is, plain and simple, a romance novel. Some of the more adult references were beyond my children, but I still found myself explaining things to my seven year old that I didn't want to explain to her until she was older. I enjoy a good love story, and so do my three pre-teen girls, but we were not interested in this love story as it was written."
5,In the beginning...,Just to feel the world into which our Savior was born is such a blessing. To give so much love to Joseph and Mary as they faced so many challenges in their time and place. Thanks to Marjorie to begin the journey.
5,Worth reading every Christmas,This novel tells the story beyond the scriptures and makes the life and trials of Mary and Joseph real. Share this journey with Mary and Joseph every year.
5,Classic story!,I bought this for my grandmother to replace her older copy. She reads this story every year at Christmas time. I'm so happy to have found a book to replace her worn copy!
4,Interesting Christmas reading,"This book is a wonderful dramatization of the story of Mary and Joseph, how they would have gotten together, and the problems they faced as they became parents of the Christchild."
5,"I feel in love with the book,I couldn't put it down.","I would tell anyone who would like to read ""Two from Galilee"" they would be reading a very close to real life version of what may have taken place concerning the life of Mary and Joseph. Of course it is not taken word for word from the Bible, but the author knew the customs and the way of life for the Jewish people and went from there. It is truly a wonderful love story about Mary and Joseph and how they may have coped with there unexpected news of Mary being chosen to bear the Son of God. I truly loved the book, in fact I just recently read it again for the second time. I usually read a book one time and put it away, this little book was just as moving the second time around(I read it the first time right after it was published, and just reread it again)"
4,Shed a new light...,"My mom suggested I read this book after she found it at a church library book sale. She said she had read it when she was around my age (17) and loved it. I was skeptical but read it having nothing else to read. I was hooked by the first chapter! I've always viewed Mary and Joseph in a non-human way I guess...not that I believe they're deities or super-natural or anyway more ""important"" then everyone else...but I didn't think of them going through the same struggles of passion and desire and going through the wonders of falling in love, not have any idea of what was to happen. It spoke to me about true love and purity and holiness in a way I didn't expect. Definitely a great alternative to the romance novels we see today."
4,Greatest Little Soul Band in the Land,"Saw J.J.Jackson around 1970 in Doncaster, great. I already have this on Vinyl and needed the CD version. Great Album, has But It's Alright and the Sam Cooke perennial, Change Gonna Come. Worth it just for these but I have always liked I dig Girls and the other tracks."
3,Not as good as expected,"I have always loved ""But It's Alright"" by J.J. Jackson, so I was hoping that this CD would have more songs with the same sound. However, I was rather disappointed. The songs were not up to my expectations as far as the beat and sound."
2,Bass Solos Deluxe,"If you are a big fan of bass guitar solos, this is the CD for you. But, I am not a big fan of bass guitar solos, so I do not care for about half the songs. Much of it is bass solos with drums and some intermitent guitar or keyboard sounds. I made a CD from it of the songs that do not have extended bass solos; it is about 45 minutes long. I like funky jazz, but this was a disappointment to me."
5,Can you feel IT!,I saw Marcus Miller live in the spring of this year and it was something to behold. If you are a bass fan and don't get a chance to see Marcus Live than this it. When you are there you Can Feel It. You will also FEEL IT on this CD. Who said that Fender is dead?
3,I am disappointed in Simmons!,"I regard Simmons namebrand highly, however these covers are just okay and border on not okay. I bought the Simmons contoured changing pad, therefore these covers should fit nicely right? Think again they pull up the edges of the pad and eventually make creases in the bottom of the pad. I throw everything in my dryer and was sorely disappointed after the very first of many washings to see stray pulled threads all over my covers. All three of my covers are navy and with multiple washings the thread issue gets worse, however the color has never faded. The cover does do a good job of keeping the pad free of changing time issues :) and that is what it was designed to do. There are not alot of other choices for covers out there so I guess I'd say these are still a necessity, but shame on Simmons for the quality of this product!"
4,Great product,"I decided to purchase this cover when I bought a new changing pad after the birth of my third child, and the covers for my old changing pad did not fit properly. I have washed and dried it several times so far, and it has held its shape, and mine has not faded, yet. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I believe the cover is just a bit pricey, which is why I haven't, yet, decided to purchase another one. In a pinch I can still use my old covers. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product. It's like a thick comfy towel."
4,Fits fine,I have the contoured changing pad and this cover fits fine. I wash it in warm water and throw it in the dryer and it works just fine.
2,Simmons Cover and Especially for Baby Contour Pad don't mix,"I just received the cover as a gift and it is soooo soft, BUT, it is about 3 inches too short (length wise) to fit the Especially for Baby Contour changing pad. It's too short in the actual fabric... I could stretch the elastic around the pad, but then the ""contour"" is taken out of the ""contoured"" pad at the corners. Just thought I would add a review stating that you should be careful when using two different brands together. They won't always be compatible and I didn't realize this until after receiving both parts as a gift."
2,Falls Apart,"I have two of these covers one in white and one in navy, and they both have problems. They do in fact shrink when you wash them, even in cold water. Mine also have the same problem with coming apart all around the elastic. We've only used them for about two months now....quite disappointing."
2,Make additional work for yourself!,"Like many other reviews say, these covers will be ripped at the seams after one or two wash cycles. I don't personally mind that they fit snugly, b/c it creates almost a little sling above the concave changing pad. However, don't expect plush, thick terry cloth - this fabric is more like a cheap, old Holiday Inn towel. If you hold it up to the light, you can see through it. Consequently, it doesn't contain baby messes as the manufacturer claims. Besides, as soon as your baby messes on it (almost every day for my newborn), you have to launder it and put on a new one. I hate saying it, but the most convenient thing for us has been disposable ""chucks"", or underpads, purchased at CVS/Walgreens/Eckerd/Etc. We're not using them anymore, but I wish someone would develop a less wasteful changing pad that is that convenient."
2,You're going to wash this thing a whole lot!,"Positive:1. They are comfy for baby I'm sure2. They make your changing table look nice and completeNegatives:1. Baby (boys or girl) will unexpectedly pee right after you take that dirty diaper off many many times throughout infanthood! I found that even if I put a burb cloth down (I have a baby girl) her urine, if I didn't catch it with a clean diaper FAST would soak through the burp cloth, changing pad cover AND right onto the plastic.Solution?I ditched the changing pad covers because I found they take up a lot of space in the wash and I simply change my little girl on the plastic. When pee or poop gets on it, I simply wipe it down and disinfect it. Ta da, no more bothersome covers to deal with. They're a waste of money in my opinion and I'm going to bring them to a consignment shop."
2,Quite disappointed,"The cover does make the changing pad more comfortable; however, my son never seemed to mind just the pad by itself. That's a very good thing, since we bought two of these pads and they were both constantly in the laundry since whenever ANYTHING gets on them, they need to be washed. We'd be lucky to get a full day of use out of one when my son was a newborn. And after about a month they had so many stains on them that would not come out, that I just tossed them. Don't waste your money."
1,SHRINKS,What else can I add that hasn't already been said? I just wish I had read the reviews first. Before using it the first time I washed in cold water and dried on delicate. It is now too small to fit on the changing table (I had checked before I washed it to make sure it was the right size - obviously it shrunk.)
2,A Pain,"Because I had a little boy, this changing pad was the target of many late night diaper change mishaps. So, we had to wash it frequently. It immediately looked ragged and old. I stopped using it and just laid a blanket on the changing pad that could be easily washed."
1,Cheap quality,I have two of these in navy blue - the color faded and they are both starting to come unraveled and my son is only 4 months old. I would not recommend these covers.
1,This is wated money,"I purchased two of these for my changing pad. Not only did they stain immediately with urine, but they also shrunk so small after one wash that they ruin the changing pad by pulling it up. Don't waste your money"
2,OK,This cover shrunk after I washed it and it doesn't fit as well on my changing pad now. Since it shrunk it is a chore to get it back over the pad after it is washed.
5,Great Album and Great price,"I bought this CD just because of one song that was on it, but I thought that it probably had some other good songs and for the price I wouldn't be upset either way. However, I was pleasantly suprised! There were tons of good songs that I liked on the cd and even more so than the song I originally purchased it for. It's a good buy!"
2,Darkseid of the Moon . . . ???,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to hear the Justice League of America's exploits set to pop music? Neither had I, until I heard TOTAL JUSTICE! It's totally rocking, totally cool, and totally . . . uh . . . rocking! Hear as Green Lantern, Robin, and all the rest try to stop Darkseid's evil plot to destroy the earth, set to the kaleidescopic sounds of a pop/funk soundtrack that defies description. Total Justice is totally out of print, and a total trip. Do yourself a favor, and seriously consider how much you're willing to pay for a good laugh. Based on the somewhat popular toy line."
2,"Fine for Windows XP users, but NOT Vista","I have been using this CardScan for a while now with Windows XP and it has proved to do an adequate job. However I recently changed to the Vista operating system and the scanner stopped working so I went looking for an downloadable update on the company website but was unable find any. I contacted CardScan by email and they replied that they indeed had an upgrade available but that I would have to pay $80 (plus S&H) for it. All of the other hardware vendors for other products I use with my computer (Dymo LabelWriter, Neat Receipts, etc) either offered a free downloadable Vista update or an update for a reasonable charge. Because of this I did not purchase the way overpriced CardScan upgrade and can now only give this otherwise good product two stars. I will not be purchasing another CardScan product in the future."
2,Didn't work out well at all.,"I bought this product because I have heard some good things about it's durability. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way for me. It chips easily, and when I tried to sand it to smooth it out more chips kept coming off. A good drop and huge chunks came off. Maybe I did something wrong, not sure how since all I thought I needed to do was add water at the right ratio and make the project. I wouldn't be able to recommend this product to anyone. Maybe I can add it to some other paper mache mixture I make that might actually work."
3,"Okay product, not that easy to work with","Depends on what you're using it for. Our hope was that it would be easy to use and dry to a hard smooth finish. It was a little messy and dried to a hard but not so smooth surface. May work for you, depending on what you need.."
1,abysmal,I paid $75 for a DVD which appeared to be an outdated educational publication. I was expecting something a lot more but was sadly disappointed. I do not expect an oscar winning production but what I received was far from anything I thought I would receive for the money.Also at the very beginning of the DVD there was an advertisement that if you accessed a particular website you could get educational videos for free. Maybe that is where I should have gone.Had I paid $20 I would not be complaining quite so bitterly.
3,BEFORE YOU BUY...!!!,"If you're buying this manual then chances are that you aren't stopping at Calculus III. This book DOES NOT include chapters beyond 12, so if you're seeking help in Calculus III, you won't find it here."
4,It's worth it,"The bottom line is, this book you will cut your study time down to just a few hours a week. Calculus is tough no matter how smart you are, and nothing that deals with calculus walks in baby steps. The reality is that the solutions in this book will make life a little easier for calc students.This book covers both Calculus I and Calculus II from its respective text book. Some explanations are great, others are lacking. I found this book to be particularly useful for problems which require some ""trick"" that you would otherwise never know about. I used this book for both Calc I and II, and it helped me with every problem I faced. By my estimation, if you buy this book and it saves you a few headaches, it was probably worth it."
5,Worth its weight in Gold!,"This book is worth every penny I paid...but buy it used if possible. My professor assigns odd number problems and this book provides the solutions to these problems. Many students don't do their homework, but having a resource to check my solutions motivates me to complete all of the assigned homework."
3,It's an okay solutin book.,"Well you get solutions to all the odd numbers problems in the Book which is okay, but if you looking for even problems' sloutions This is not the book to spend money. Like most solution manuals, it do skip steps from time to time. Not the best book you can buy, but it does help you practice while you are alone and no one to help you with."
1,Terrible quality,BEWARE. This is of the quality you find on Dollar Store watches . Additionally for a childs watch it sure doesn't have enough holes on the strap to put on my 6 year olds wrist. Buy elsewhere.
5,Medication for the pain,"Some of us see the hand of the Devine most clearly in our appreciation of the transcendent beauty of the universe, and in particular that of our home planet. Some of us are in great spiritual pain because what we see happening to the environment and the web of life.""Blue Mountain"" with its wide range of poetry, proverbs, excerpts,and brief essays celebrating the earth was easily the best collection of its kind recently read. It was healing medicine for environmental melancholia and despair. Even though it does nothing to change the daily headlines, the renewal of spirit was a spring tonic for the soul.Reading it again can even ignite a smoldering ember of hope."
5,A Powerful Book,"This is a book to take with you on trips, a book to keep by your bedside, to read aloud to friends, or to hold close just for the private joy it brings you. Bachleda's love for the natural world and her wise, humane approach to inhabiting it are a joy. She's a rare and wonderful writer! Amy Lynch"
4,good mixture of music,"This is a great compilation of classical movie themes good quality vinyl record and recordings, loved listening to themes rarely heard these days"
3,A Better Title.,"It is a good reference for the study of ""The Golden Flower"" meditative technique.However, some of the low points have already been alluded to in prior reviews offered here concerning this book.For instance, I too think Mr. Cleary could have done a much better job of trying to offer clarity, and in formatting, his approach in assisting the reader who may not be to familiar in Buddhist alchemy. Instead, he spends about half his time interjecting why Wilhelm and Jung were wrong in their handling of the subject. If that was his original intent then he should have just titled the book as ""A Study of Why Wilhelm and Jung Misinterperted the Secret of the Golden Flower"".I think this Classic Chinese Book of Life is so short and sweet but yet so profound that this book is still worth buying.I can just hear a Chan Buddhist Master saying "" Yes Mr. Cleary I know you wrote this book but did you bother to read it?"""
3,Good Not Excellent,"This book is a good new English translation of the original Chinese text, and nothing more. The reader has to be familiar with Taoist text to unlock the full secret of the golden flower. Cleary seem to have a personal grudge against the translator of the original English version of this book and in doing so it leaves the reader disillusioned as to what exactly is the secret.If you like Taoist literature this book is invaluable, but if you want to learn the meditation technique get you hands on Wilhelm's original translation. Better explanations can be had from Wilhelm."
4,one interesting translation,"This book has been very underestimated, even though it was Carl Jung and Richard Wilhelm who edited it some time ago.In this translation I found out other meanings of the book. This is enough for me. The commentary is also satisfying, after all. The mistakes of the previous translation (i. e., Wilhelm's one) have been corrected, and some partialities as well.Nevertheless, it is a book requiring an application, a put-into-practice as it were, and you may not be contented with a mere reading. You can see the cake but not have it."
5,The perfect companion to the HSP book.,"If you are serious about understanding being a highly sensitive person and want to, "". . . Thrive When the World Overwhelms You,"" this book can be very helpful. It caused me to think hard about what I'd read in The Highly Sensitive Person; consider what I must do to overcome any obstacles and make positive changes in my life.Sometimes - even when I know what I must do - I procrastinate, then let things that can be helpful to me go by the wayside. This workbook made me plow ahead and do what had to be done. I appreciate that.The two volumes, The Highly Sensitive Person and the woorkbook are certaily well worth the time, effort and few dollars invested in them."
5,Wonderful companion,"I bought The Highly Sensitive Person a few years ago and felt that someone understood me for the first time. When a workbook to accompany the original was released I couldn't wait to buy it. I was not disappointed. It can be used as a stand alone text but I have been rereading the original and doing the exercises in the workbook at the same time. Elaine Aron is sensitive to us HSPs. Her workbook is not at all overwhelming and can be done at your own pace and as in depth as you want to go. I thank Elaine for standing up for those of us that while at times may be in the shadows are certainly not invisible. We are capable, strong, caring individuals and Elaine Aron, being one herself, is very in tune with the world as it affects us.I recommend purchasing both the original text and the workbook."
5,Wonderful Help,"I haven't made it through the workbook in its entirety, but what I have done has been amazing in giving me insight into my life and how certain things have affected me throughout. helping me overcome the negative thoughts concerning this aspect of my personality. I was blessed to have a co-worker see this in me, guiding me to this book. She is an HSP as well, and she was truly someone who helped me understand this part of myself I always thought was something to be ashamed of. Beth (my co-worker) is actually the woman I dedicated this workbook to."
2,Didn't care for this book.,"There were some intelligent points, but a lot of the ideas were rather silly. The reading is also boring. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Not really helpful...,"I'm a highly sensitive person, and in today's world, it can be a handicap -- whether at the workplace or in relationships. This book, and it's companion, the Highly Sensitive Person -- validates what you're feeling or what you go through in life as a ""HSP"" (or, let's be honest - BPD sufferer) -- but it doesn't give you any real, helpful tools to try to overcome your sensitivity.I would be apt to recommend any type of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) book, or even books like Byron Katie's ""Loving What Is"" or ""I Need Your Love -- Is That True?"" over this."
3,A pretty good introduction to these fascinating phenomena,"This book provides a pretty good introduction for those who are interested in learning about ""supernatural vanishings"". It includes interesting case histories of unexplianed dissappearances and teleportation, and even a few related to time dislocation. However, my main criticism with the book is that is deals mostly with very old cases. The first couple of chapters deal mainly with ancient cases- which could be attributed to legends and myths. The later parts of the book deal mainly with cases from the 14th to early 20th century. if you are sceptical before buying the book, this book will probably not be sufficient to change your mind; but if you read with an open mind, this is a pretty enjoyable read."
4,I believe it's available on the Brookings Institution site,"I'd love to have you buy it from me, but Paul and I wrote it for the Brookings Institution. Available for free download at the Brookings Site. Best, Maureen Kennedy, maureenkennedy@aol.com"
1,"Don't Go Away, It's Time To Play.. Guess The Model Number!!!!!!","Hey, here's a concept. How about ACTUALLY LISTING THE VALVE MODEL NUMBERS THIS KIT IS FOR????? I know that's kind of a radical idea to ACTUALLY TELL THE CUSTOMER SOMETHING ABOUT A PRODUCT AND HOW IT CAN BE USED, but I guess that's just the wild and crazy guy that I am."
1,accutron watch,"I was very disappointed with the look and style of the product for the price, I felt the watch looked too big and boxy. It made the watch look cheap. I can't criticize the quality of the workings of the watch as we never took it out of the box once we saw it. I returned it immediately. I guess I did'nt see that from the picture. I have since found a competitors product at about the same price range that I felt looked a lot better."
3,Okay,"This book was required for my class and we hardly used the book. There is some interesting information in the book, especially if you are into economics."
4,Good book,I am teaching introduction to macro for undergrads and I use this book.The book gives good basic knowledge for neophytes.
3,Not Quite What I Was Looking For,"This book was not exactly what I was looking for. I'm not Catholic, nor have I studied about St. Francis or read about him prior to this book. While ""The Way of St. Francis"" is informative to a point and a good read, this book is geared mostly for Catholics or consistanly religious people. The whole time I read this book I felt like I was missing some of the text, just due to lack of knowledge on the subject. The book also quotes a great deal of poetry, which is nice, but I was looking more for information and facts about St. Francis. Depending on what you are looking for this may or may not be the book for you."
5,Lifealtering,This book changed my life 10 years ago and through the narrative life of the little man of Assisi. A must for anyone wanting to learn about the spirtuality and human aspects of Francis' character.
4,It works!,"I don't know if you've ever tried giving a pill to a cat -- it's not easy. I have to give my cat a pill everyday for the rest of her life and at first we did the pinch the cheek, shove the pill in and hope that the cat doesn't spit it back out or bite my finger off. We thought it was working until we found a little pile of pills in her bed. This piller definatly makes things easier but it's not without faults. You still need two people to make this work. One to hold the cat, another to use the piller. It's really not made for tiny pills and as it turns out we ended up using the salmon method of giving the pill. Take pill, put it in a piece of salmon, give to cat. Much easier."
1,Horrible,"This didn't work for us at all. First, I think there's a good chance that the product I received is broken. The plunger sticks and is very hard to move even a little bit. Once I finally got it to move to put the pill in, it didn't pop the pill out when I depressed the plunger. The second problem is that the tip is the wrong size for two out of three different pills my cat has to take. The largest is to big, and the smallest is too small. One pill fit, but as I mentioned before, once I placed it in the tip, I couldn't get the piller to pop it out (the rod was too short to push the pill out). This item was an epic fail for me, and its now in the trash. I suggest trying another style of pet piller (even though they're more expensive, the right one really can help!)"
5,"Great, but more than what I thought I was getting","So it's a great filter and everything (hence all the stars) but I didn't realize I was getting 2 filters. So anyone out there buying this it is a set of 2 filters, not just one. Would have rather paid less and just gotten the one, but now that I have two it is rather nice to alternate. Just an fyi."
5,StarClear Pool Filter Cartridge,"Located this pool filter cartridge at Amazon and ordered online. Arrived a few days later (selected free shipping but it still arrived 3 days later) and was very pleased with the quality. Installed it in my pump filter unit and it has worked very well. Bought my previous cartidge at a local pool store for 2.5X the cost. Wish I had known about this then! A word of wisdom for new pool owners like myself (actually a new home owner with an old pool). Most pools built today have DE filter units, not a cartridge. A cartridge unit is definitely old technology. To increase the particle trapping ability of the cartridge (DE is much more efficient) you should add DE or Pur-Fiber to the skimmer. It will get taken up and coat the filter making it more efficient at trapping small particles like algae. I learned the hard way!"
2,Did not have the gasket as shown in the picture!!,I bought this as a direct replacement for an older Unicel cartridge but it DID NOT have the gasket as shown in the pictures and mentioned in the description. I contacted Amazaon and was sent a replacement pair which did not have the gasket either so I ended up contacting the Unicel direct to see what the deal was. The sales person that I spoke to said that the product had been changed about 8 years ago and no longer has the gasket attached. For some reason it would not build the correct pressure when installed in the filter so I ended up selling and getting a new DE filter for my pool...
3,Decent,"This is a decent book. Being an autobiography, it focuses more on the personal than the big picture, which is what most people would be interested in. However, while it often spends an inordinate amount of time on minor episodes in Kareem's life it is a solid book. My only big criticism of the book is that it glosses over his career after around 1977. He says little about Magic Johnson, his relationship with him and the great Lakers' teams of the 1980's and their dominance of that decade, their legendary rivalry with the Bird-McHale-Parish Celtics. Far more time is spent on his time in high school. All of this said, if you are interested in learning about perhaps the greatest basketball player ever I would recommend reading this book."
4,A NICE READ FROM SPECIAL K,"KAREEM TELLS OF HIS LIFE GROWING UP IN NEW YORK IN GREAT DETAIL IN THIS BOOK. BUT I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD US MORE ABOUT HIS PLAYING DAYS AT UCLA, MILWAUKEE AND LOS ANGELES. THIS HAS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF LIKE HIS FIRST MEETING WITH WILT, HIS TEAMMATES AT UCLA, AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHERYL PISTANO. I REALLY FOUND HIS BUDDAHISM AND ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED TO BE VERY WEIRD AND UNINTERESTING. KAREEM IS AN INTELLIGENT GUY WHO ENJOYS THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL THINGS IN LIFE. HIS PIECE AT THE TIME CHERYL PISTANO, HELPED HIM TO BE MORE OUTGOING AND CORDIAL TO PEOPLE AND HELPED OPEN HIS LIFE MORE. JUST WISHED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DETAILED ABOUT HIS SEASON TO SEASON CAREER AT UCLA AND THE NBA. A GOOD READ."
4,Giant Book,"The only thing bigger than the chip on Mr. Abdul-Jabbar's shoulder in this text is the grand and engaging story he tells. For fans or just the curious observer (as I was), he takes us on an insightful journey into his motivation, his doubts, his difficulties, and his dreams. It sometimes seems that the persona behind the person is revealed more to the reader than to the writer."
1,Introduction to Technical Mathematics Fifth Edition,"Introduction to Technical Mathematics (5th Edition)This is a new textbook with an ENORMOUS amount of typos! There is at least one error per every small section. Several sections have 3or more errors. Most are in the answer key at the back of the book. These typos make you start to question your work and take extra time to reevaluate for any error you may have made. This seems to undermind the lesson altogether! Much time is wasted in trying to figure out who's error it is, yours or theirs? This book is NOT recommended."
2,Not my choice,"I am using this book right now as I go through college Technical Mathmatics for the first time. UGH! It is not good. Far too few examples and explainations. It does a 'fly-over' on the nitty-gritty.We have only covered a few chapters so far. It was the mandated book for this college course. But what little I have read, if this was a book I had bought for myself, I would have already decided to sell this one and get a different one.I will be updating my review as I go through this course, but so far this book blows!"
5,AS MANY STARS AS U CAN COUNT PLEASE !!!,"Scorching love scenes, realistic plot, intense dialogue,and to sum it up : extraordinary. This is her first book that I read, and now I'm addicted to anything w/ her name on the cover. I just can't compliment this spellbinding novel enough. If U have any romantic bone in your body, go pick this one up and treasure it !!!"
5,Lady of the West,"Oh my god, what a great book. I did not want it to end and devoured this book in just a few evenings. The passion and romance were incredible and the heat between the two main characters was scortching hot...I am still coming down from reading it. This is a woman's fantasy book and I loved every minute of reading it."
2,Didn't work for me...,"Every other book that I have read by this author I have really enjoyed, but not this one. This wasn't about love, but force. These were not characters that are larger than life, but smaller than the average joe."
5,Wonderful! Very romantic.,"I absolutely loved this book! Its only the 2nd Linda Howard book I've read and now I want to read all of them! This book has strong characters and a great plot. I didn't want it to end, I wish all books could be this good!"
2,Disturbing,"The first Linda Howard book I read was All The Queen's Men, and since then I have read almost all of her earlier and later work. She writes sensual stories, erotic, passionate, usually great character development. I was disturbed by this book in many ways that I haven't been in reading some of her other work. This hero is abusive, emotionally and physically to the heroine and that I just cannot abide. Many of her characters from other books are certainly flawed, like most real people are, but this I just couldn't take and I couldn't finish it."
3,A devoted fan of Linda Howard.,"I've loved Linda Howard's books ever since i first read After the Night, which remains my favourite book EVER!But unfortunately i didn't like this book at all, or more accurately i didn't like the main characters. Jake didn't have that special quality that all of LH's other male characters do...tenderness combined with strength, he was very harsh and i really objected to the part where he hit Victoria. Victoria was okay but again she just didn't have those special qualities that make me admire Linda's female characters so much.To anyone who's never read Linda Howard i strongly reccomend you read her other books before you read this one."
2,Soooo disappointing,"If this was the first Linda Howard book I ever read, I would not have read another. If forced and abusive sex turns you on, this is the book for you. I read it to the end to give it a chance, but was completely disappointed."
2,Not Howard's usual.....,"I love Linda Howard. However, this was the first book I have read where her lead man, Jake, fell short. This book reminded me of a Diana Palmer read, which often includes rough and abusive *heros*. I took issue with the physical abuse, which included slapping a pregnant woman and knocking her over, forcing sexual situations and emotional battering that went on throughout the book. I am a big fan of Cry No More and Kiss Me While I Sleep - this book was not of the same type."
1,NASTY!,"I love Linda Howard normally, but in this case I would recommend that you steer clear of this book, as it might well turn you off her forever. I would have given it less than one star if I could. To cut a long story short, this book contains scenes of rape and domestic violence, which I found deeply offensive and disturbing - especially since these crimes were committed by the so-called hero! At one point the hero seriously contemplates murdering the heroine in order to gain control of his family ranch. Instead he marries her, and proceeds to make her life misery. I know some women think that, in a historical context, such things are okay, and if that's your opinion, fine. However, most Linda Howard fans love the tenderness and protectiveness displayed by her heroes, and there isn't ANY in this book."
2,Have read better...,"I have recently developed a serious crush for Linda Howard books, but this one was rather disappointing. My overall impression was that it all seemed very barbaric. All male characters treat women like possessions and the hero is no different. I refuse to go with the idea that sex, no matter how great, solves all problems and heals all wounds. The tragic events were sad, but very flat, and the book ended without a proper heart-to-heart conversation between the two main characters. Realistic maybe, but not what I wanted."
3,The end is so boring...,"As many times that happened to me I read first the sequel ""Angel Creek"" before this one. This time that was perfect because if I had read this one before I'd never read ""Angel Creek"".The book's first part was fairly good. But as the love story goes on the book gets boring. What I didn't understand is why one of the girls had to die, that part was just pathetic."
1,A BIG Mistake >_<,"I've enjoyed lots of Linda Howard's books, but I must say that there are quite a few that left me disappointed. A common problem being, the hero gets away too easily after treating his lady shabbily. I was thoroughly disgusted by the hero in this book. He actually slapped her so hard, she slammed into the wall!! Gosh.... and he got away with it later, as if it was just a petty quarrel over who's to do the dishes! For a great story, try Son of the Morning or Midnight Rainbow. There are many other great stories from Ms Howard, but I enjoyed these 2 the most! ^_^"
4,Una preciosa voz para un gran compositor,"Indudablemente uno de los compositores mas prolificos del bolero fue Agustin Lara. En esta ocasion interpretado magistralmente por Javier Solis quien curiosamente vino a encontrar la gloria unos cuantos años despues de su muerte (1966). En particular, en Colombia su musica logro la mayor aceptacion en los primeros años de la decada del 70."
2,Old Trick,I express my outrage at this shameless manifestation of typical old 'trick' Armenians pursue in regards of Georgian cultural heritage.Having plentry of their own architectural monuments there was no obvious need to 'steal' Svetitskhoveli cathedral's photo and put it on cover of Armenian song's CD.
1,falsification,"And why am not I surprised about one more fact of Armenians trying to present Georgian cultural Heritage as their own one?! The monastery on the CD image is Georgian, located in Mtskheta near Tbilisi."
2,Customer misleading,"Dear Amazon, the item you are selling through your respective site is misinforming the customers. The cover of this CD shows one of the most important and oldest cathedrals of 11th century in Georgia (Republic of Georgia) and it has nothing to do with Armenia."
2,Why The Rest Hates The West,"Very timely, very frightening, and very poorly written. A difficult read. Meic Pearse is like the speaker who likes to hear himself, but substitutes the written word - a lot of them, with a lot of syllables, and vague meaning.The subject matter is too important to be presented in such an obtuse and confusing treatise, but worth the struggle."
5,Thoughtful and Refreshing,"The author definitely has a strong Christian world-view, but is refreshingly different from the usual gushings of the relgious-right and the conservative talk-show crowd.I would hope non-religious readers would keep an open mind, think through some of the arguements Meic Pearse makes, and not ""write off"" the author because he comes from a historic Christian world-view.I would also hope religious (i.e. conservative Christians) would think through how culturally entrenched their version of ""American Christianity"" may actually be, and realize God is not a Republican - or an American.While not necessarily an ""easy read,"" I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking beyond the standard arguements and views of polical left or right."
1,More about pop Americana than the TV series,"I thought this book would be an in-depth look at LinS and its times. It is actually more about the late 50's to mid-Sixties US. It had a few nice photos but spent more time on the Moon and Mars Landings and the Cold War than it did on the Space Family Robinson. I was tremendously disappointed. Also, it could have been edited a bit better...many quotes are used as chapter headings and as photo captions and then often in the middle of the text as well! It looks real nice but is not worth the money. The best part of the book was the two-page interviews with most of the actors telling us what they have been up to since the end of the series. Don't buy this unless you are a real LinS fanatic. For great photos of the classic series I recommend the LinS Arcade Series Entertainment Utility CD from Sound Source Interactive instead."
4,"A book that discuses Lost in Space, as well as pop culture","Lost in Lost in Space is an exellent book. It not only talks about Lost in Space, but also about sixties pop culture. I reccomend this book for fans of Lost in Space."
3,THIS BOOK GOT LOST WHILE COVERING LOST IN SPACE,"THIS IS A BOOK COVERING THE TV SHOW ALONG WITH OTHER EVENTS WHICH WERE GOING ON DURING THE SHOW'S 3 YEAR RUN. IT ALSO COVERS ALOT OF STRANGE SCIENCE AND SCI-FI TOPICS. WHEN THE BOOK STICKS TO LOST IN SPACE IT IS AN OK READ, WHEN IT STRAYS OFF TO OTHER TOPICS IT IS NOT TOO GOOD. GOOD INTERVIEWS AND INFO ABOUT THE CAST AND IRWIN ALLEN IS WORTH READING. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR THE AVERAGE FAN OF THE SHOW. A DECENT READ."
5,Great Quality HP LaserJet,HP hit a home run with this printer. They are work horses! We have had 6 in our office [3 still work hard everyday]. This printer exceeds the stated printer live significantly.As long as HP printer cartridges are used the machine runs flawlessly.
5,2nd season show hit their stride...,"...and was so much fun to watch these guys whom I had the pleasure of glimpsing in a NYC Thanksgiving Day Parade in the '80s. Also, gotta love the always brilliant Stephen J. Cannell. Thanks for supplying this series!!!"
1,riptide,"Your memories are always better than the second time around. I thought I like this series when it was on T.V.It's just so dated and not in a good way, but in a very BAD way. It just all noise and the goofy nerd whose just awful with his inventions and his demeanor."
3,Reallly too easy for me...,"I received these books as a gift from my Mom, and they are okay, I guess. My siblings are learning to read and they could read them. These books are good for six year olds, but not a good reader like me."
3,Browser/Organizer is Very Slow,"I have been a loyal PSP customer for years, since version 3.0 In every other version, the browser palette (now ""organizer"") has worked great--now it is so slow that it essentially never loads certain folders. On a comment below, I see that someone has information that Corel is working on it. I hope so. At present, I am very disappointed with an ""upgrade"" that is less useful than its immediate predecessor. Once they fix that problem--assuming they *do* fix it--then I would recommend the upgrade gladly."
3,Paint Shop Pro - just like Photo Shop,I like this product it is very similiar to Photo Shop. It does require some reading in order to understand the different things which can be used.Would have liked to know that it does require a lot of reading in order to understand it entirely.
1,"Many, many problems","I've been a loyal Paint Shop Pro user since version 3. I've used it on major commercial design projects, right alongside Photoshop on my Mac and Gimp on my Linux box. Sadly, version XI is one of the poorest software builds of any product I have ever seen. It locks up, won't start, won't close, takes forever to load, and has issues with many fundamental functions such as JPEG formats, loading/saving files, cache management, and thumbnail generation! Really, it is just unbelievably bad. Worse, when it crashes, although you can kill it from Windows Task Manager, it will immediately crash if you try to launch it again -- you'll have to reboot your computer to get it to work. Moreover, it is painfully slow, even on my fast Intel Core 2 Duo box with dual-channel memory and SATA drives. My advice to users is to stick with Version 9."
2,Not for me: Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI,"I bought a full retail copy of Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and don't like it at all - I've probably spent 5 hrs. now trying to learn to use it with little luck. The tutorial CD won't play in my new MS Vista laptop. The manual is of little use. The help with the program is just like the manual - of little use.I've been using the software that came with an old Sony Mavica camera I bought several years back - it wouldn't load on my new laptop, so I bought PSP - I am really disappointed in it. It might be capable of doing great things, but I don't know how you would ever learn to do them!!I'm going to discard this useless program and buy Photo Shop Elements 5 - I feel Corel cheated me on this program!!"
3,Disappointed,"Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI doesn't come close to being as easy to use as my Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7, but then I haven't spent much time working with it because it is so slow to load and function. I upgraded the memory in my computer and even went beyond the basic requirement of 512mb of RAM, but the program still drags its heels, so I always end up going back to using PSP 7. If I had it to do over again, I'd do more research on the pros and cons of this software program before buying it."
1,Not very Vista compatible,"I have used PSP for over 10 years now. Vista + PSP is a disaster. It will crash for no reason (not performing ANY operations). At this point, I will probably uninstall and install version 9 (and turn on XP compatibility)."
5,"Capable and well featured, and a bargain to boot","I was in the market to buy more capable software than the software provided with the DSLR I bought, and decided, after reading some other reviews to try this out, figuring that for $50 or $60, if I decide that it didn't suit me, at least I didn't have much invested(like the $300 Lightroom software, yikes!). I have been really satisfied with PSP Photo so far though. If you are just interested in a really capable, and fairly easy to use image editing software application, it would be hard for me to recommend anything else. PSP Photo is an extraordinary bargain, considering it's low price, enormous(at least for me) featureset, and it is amazingly easy to use. And if you want to try it for free, Corel will let you download a time-limited but full-featured trial version of PSP Photo from their website. If you try it, and try it with an open-minded attitude(like I did) you will probably agree that you can't get anything better for this price."
5,Great Photo Editing Tool,Paint Shop XI is easy to use with the Learning Center available at the tip of your finger to guide you through each process. I had Paint shop Pro 7 and loved it but this version is much better for a novice and has so many easy features and one step adjustments.
2,No better than previous versions,"I upgraded to version XI when I read a review that said it would open Nikon D200 RAW (.NEF) files. I hoped that it would open my .NEF files from a Nikon D80 and Kodak Raw (.KDC) files from a Kodak P880 Camera. Both the Nikon and the Kodak RAW file formats are in the ""Open"" Dialog, but opening a .NEF file yields an ""unsupported file"" error. Attempting to open a .KDC file yields a ""missing parameter"" error. An email to customer support asking if these formats should or would be supported got me an email response that was totally unrelated to my question.XI takes a long time to load, the browser window changed to something unusable a couple versions ago, and I have not discovered any significant new features.I've used Paint Shop Pro since it was shareware. My recommendation would be to stick with older versions of Paint Shop Pro; preferably one from before Corel bought Paint Shop Pro from JASC."
3,sent x1 on same dayx2 is available,why would amazon send me x1 when x2 came out the same day as x2 was available at the same price.
1,Make sure this supports your camera's RAW images,"I bought the software ( Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same. So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which Canon camera made the image. So far, there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I must admit I am a novice in respect to digital photography but this program is a little too complicated for me (more than I can handle at this point). The cyber-shot viewer that came with my camera met my needs for photo editing but did not offer a ""delete picture"" option or the capacity to print to a disk. I thought the print to disk option was a part of the Paint Shop package which it does not appear to be."
4,Happy Customer,"I purchased this program specifically to pick images from two different photos and place them on a third picture as a background.It worked great. For the most part this is a relatively easy program to use and it can do big tricks...I like it, would recommend it."
5,I like Paint Shop Pro.,This is a simple and easy to use photo editing program. This is my thrid version of Paint Shop I have used and the best version yet to be released. Would recomend this to someone who wants a simple photo editor.
2,Buggy,"I create digital scrapbooking graphics and frequently save items in .png format - which, with this program, can't be done properly. It does not retain the transparency. If you save it with the optimizer, you get an ugly background. Without the optimizer, it tricks you into thinking it is alright because it looks transparent to you - however, opening it in any other program (such as PSE, PSCS, PSP9, PSPX, etc) the transparency is replaced by a white background. As of yet, there is no fix for this. It runs extremely slowly and keeps losing track of where my plugins are saved. It's got potential if some patches to fix these issues are released."
1,New Version Is Complete Garbage,"I too was excited about the new version of Paint Shop Pro. Then I installed it. It takes 2.5-6 minutes to start it with common operations that used to be done in real time taking seconds. Also the new layout of the dialog boxes add unnessicary extra clicks and moved useful functions like quick preview to inconvinient places. This together with it crashing 50% of the time I run it.Corel now admits that the program is really slow when you have a large image library and say they are working on a solution. If you are wondering what a large image collection is, I'm running at about 17 000 images, which Picasa handles quite fine.I would recommend trying to find Paint Shop Pro X right now and maybe upgrade to 12 when it comes out, but make sure to download the trial version when 12 comes out, because I agree, each version that Corel has come out with has been worse. Though I would call 10 a side step as they did add some good new features."
1,Do NOT buy this product !!!,"I bought this because I have been using Paint Shop Pro for years .Corel put in a message center , which you are supposed to be able to turn off ...NOT !For over a week now , I get this pop-up from the message center to buy the new version ...pretty annoying if you want to use the program and have that window in the way constantly ! I called Corel and they gave me a ""tip"" on how to get rid of the messages , well that only worked until I reset my computer .I have been messing around with my registry and everything I could think of . NOTHING worked so far!Looks like I will be asking them for my money back .I don't need to be paying good money for a program that is pressuring me into buying a new version which I couldn't use unless I change my operating system !They must have been taking lessons from Microsoft !If you are smart , stay with an older version which still came from Jasc ."
2,Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow,And a resource hog. I'm sure it could be more stars but considering how long it takes to do ANYTHING & EVERYTHING it's extremely frustrating to use. After using it awhile you'll have to reboot your machine just keep using it or it'll freeze up and crash your system.
3,Slow to load - occasional crashes when Saving files,"I've used PSP 8 and X and they load and work great. However, XI is extremely slow to load and will occasionally (not always) crash after I edit a photo and Save or Save As: These occasional crashes occur on both my Toshiba laptop and HP Media Center desktop computers with 1GB of RAM. Also the cooling fans of my Toshiba laptop always come on and stay on whenever PSP XI is running as the disk activity is constant. I'm going back to PSP X for most of my work and just use Version XI when I want to use the color changer. It it weren't for the slow performance and crashes, the product would be great."
4,"Excellent, Swinging band - listening samples incorrect.","This was the first jazz album I ever owned, which my stepmother's friend gave me when I was 10 - and while the previous reviewer mentions a double album set, my LP (Westinghouse Broadcasting) only had the same tracks that are on the CD:One O'Clock JumpBalkan Mixed GrillAvalonPoor ButterflyYou're Driving me CrazyBugle Call RagMean to MeKing Porter StompSing Sing Sing.The rhythm section swings hard - Arvel Shaw, Roy Burns, Billy Bauer and Rolland Hanna provide a solid feel - Rolland Hanna's solos add a more modern, be-bop sound, which is nice - we have a transitional band here, recorded in 1958, with roots in the swing era but influenced a bit by more modern styles as well.While it may be a pick up band, the playing is fairly tight, and with a fairly all star band, including Zoot Sims in the sax section, the soloing and ensemble work is quite good."
3,Steelers visor,"Visor is what I wanted to purchase. It was received in brand new condition, no damage. However, the item took about 3 weeks to arrive, which is too long for me to wait. Thanks for this opportunity to give my review. sf"
5,Rude and funny!,"If your child loves ""Billy and Mandy,"" and you can tolerate fart sounds, this toy is great. It has a wide range of sound bites of typical ""Billyisms."""
2,Not recommended,"I found this book to be very difficult to read and also very dull. The content was good but tedious. To be frank i would not recommend this ""classic"""
2,Look how smart I am,"It is nice to read something like this even if the best case scenario now is to mock people who idolize Thoreau.Hes writing seems to have no point, no objective, except maybe to make himself seem very smart. I don't buy it. Nor do I buy into the ethics of squatting or the innocent beauty of nature.This book should be read:1) by hipsters who feel their life is pointless - they might be entranced with the descriptions of nature.2) by people who are tired of hearing people refer to Thoreau without reading his works."
5,Outstanding!,"Walden is an absolute great book. I would recommend that everyone read it. It is a deep book,but you quickly adjust."
2,"Walden, a life in the wods?",This was a well written essay of life in the wilderness. If only all of it were true. Thoreau was actually visited quite frequently by his mother and friends. They provided food and company for the lonely Thoreau. I have spent many months in the woods and only wish I could create the adventure Thoreau supposedly had.
4,Pertinent and well written,"Strangely surprising how pertinent many of Thoreau's perceptions, opinions and insights on habits and values are to modern day society and culture. And impressive how vehemently he professes these views in some sections. No sugar coating here. This is raw stuff, presented with language and skill we've lost over the years.My favorite quote: ""One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels""Thoreau is inspired and inspiring."
2,free but incomplete,"Walden itself gets 5 stars, but this free ebook is just plain incomplete. Pretty frustrating to be reading this and to all of a sudden come across missing parts, i.e. when Thoreau is enumerating his living expenses, all the information is missing. Instead I spent the $0.99 and got a complete and well formatted version ASIN: B0056OZR26 which also has an illuminating preface by Emerson."
4,everything came from yesterday,"I think, this book is usefull for people, who live in city and feel unhappy.This book can encourage you to free Yourself from consumption, do not follow fashion and will open Your eyes.This book will open the doors to the Nature.When you last time had been in forest?"
2,Walden- Thoreau's failed attempt at writing,"The message of Walden is interesting, but Thoreau's writing ruins it. Not only does he excessively go off topic, but he also is not able to effectively communicate what he is trying to say.As for this edition, it is very good, and that is where the two stars of my review come from.If Thoreau were to publish Walden today, editors would refuse to let him do it."
4,An essay on life,"I agree with a previous poster that Thoreau comes across as arrogant throughout the book, but he makes some striking observations on humanity, civilization, the pursuit of wealth, and enjoying nature. This is a book that everyone should read at some point in their life, preferably sooner rather than later. It is thought-provoking and entertaining."
1,ugh...,this copy of the book was very different from the rest of my class. the page numbers were all different and even some of the content.
3,Good for a student,Interesting for a student. I read it so my grandson could interview me for his school report. Was a good period take. It is a classic so it is said anyway.
4,a meditative read,"Whatever one may think about Thoreau's political opinions and courage - or lack of - in following them in his own life, this account of his lakeside solitary retreat is thought provoking and contains many brilliant descriptions of the simple beauty of his surroundings and the wild nature he embraced and contemplated."
2,Classics aren't always good.,Been reading some classics because I feel I should. This was not an engaging read. Got bored and skipped around to find interesting parts. Not sure how a writer can go on so long on his philosophy of life.
4,beautiful words,"This book has beautiful words and stories, although the cover is unattractive and hardly fitting to the interior. Still, I would suggest it to anyone as an affordable way to get the writings of Thoreau in your hand."
2,The Kindle Edition is terrible,I had to stop reading this kindle edition of the book because large portions of text were missing. Namely the list where Thoreau talks about how much all his building materials cost (not really that important) and (more importantly) any time he quotes someone. This is the free kindle edition.Since I did not want to pay any money for it I downloaded another edition for free from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org). They had a kindle version that includes civil disobedience and has a table of contents. Very nice! Reading that edition now and am enjoying the book itself.
3,"great classic book, this edition not ideal","This is a classic in American literature, and I'm very glad I finally got around to picking it up. So much has been written about it, I really don't think I need to write a review, I just wanted to tell kindle users that this edition doesn't work terrifically well. As others have noted, some quotes do not show at all. I finally went back to my vintage print copy. It would be worth paying a few bucks to get a better version."
5,a book that should be read by everyone,Walden is one of those books that should be read by everyone. It's one of the only books taught in school that really hit home with me. It should be renamed The Nonconformists' Handbook.
3,"blank white binding (cannot identify on bookshelf), minimalist design.","If you plan on reading this outside with a soft breeze, or even inside with a ceiling fan, then the textbook size pages will begin to curl over time. The binding is literally blank, so you cannot tell what book it is on a bookshelf. Due to the page curling and bland cover this book is certainly not good for display or even a bookshelf.If, however, you are a Thoreau fan, then you will recognize that Thoreau himself would likely appreciate the simplicity of this design. It saves paper and resources by using a minimalist approach while containing the exact same content as any other version of this classic."
5,Walden,"Was researching, indepth, the subject of why Walden was such an important influence on earlier American writing, and bought a few books to add to my personal research. This one came away as a winner!"
3,Adding art to philosophy,"I doubt I can say much about this book that hasn't been said already. It's a classic of American literature, and as thought-provoking as just about any work of philosophy. It's a bit of a dry read at times, but we must remember it's not a work of fiction. Forget about characters, and forget about the rest of Thoreau's life, and focus on what he's trying to say.That being said, this book is a beautiful edition of a classic work. Bound in hardcover, with a sturdy dust jacket, the pages feature beautiful woodcuts that greatly enhance the substance of the book. If you're willing to spend a little extra, a highly recommend this edition."
3,"I don't consider this a ""hardcover""",I ordered this version of Walden specifically because it was a hardcover. I wanted something more durable because I love this book and wanted to display it on my living room table. I recieved the book today and will be returning it because I do not consider it a hardcover.
2,Get another edition,"This is a great book, of course. But this edition is awful. The font is tiny, the margins ridiculously thin. I was so disappointed to open the package and find this version."
1,A waste of time...,"This is the most horrible book I've ever read. If you think you can ""discover yourself"" or ""discover the meaning of life"" by going out into the woods by yourself well then you have a social problem. I don't believe a pond can tell you anything about people or about anything for that matter. What can happen to you if you go live in solitary for a long period of time is that you can develop a mental problem, and that's about it. Sure, lets get rid of everything in life that makes us happy, simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Ha! This only sounds like a very depraved soul crying out for help. I think the only thing we can learn from this book is that it is not a good idea to go live in the woods by yourself, because it's hard. I say this book is a complete waste of time. It is perhaps the most boring piece of literature I've ever laid eyes. I say save your time and money and don't read this book."
4,Some day I too hope to live as Thoreau in the wood near a lonely space where I can once again live my bohemian simple life.,This book has made me realize how ignorant we all really are. Stressing ourselves out for our checks to live like brainless robots when we could live a happy life of ease and pleasure in nature.
3,Book: Walden,"This book arrived promptly on my Kindle. I just can't seem to get into it, but plan to finish it sometime."
5,Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition,"I would definitely recommend this book, Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition, to a family member, friend or colleague. Thank you."
2,"Love the material, but fire the narrator","I'm reluctant to be harsh. But the narration ruins the audio book. I was very disappointed. The narrator is not only monotone (as another review suggests), but he speaks. Very. Slowly. And. Over. Emph. A. Sizes. Every. Syllable. No joke: he almost sounds like a computer voice synthesizer. It's distracting and it's hard to follow the prose. I listened to only one chapter and had to stop. I have more than two dozen audio books, and enjoying walking and listening. But I'll have to pick up a copy of the printed book on this one."
3,Good ideas but unbearable tone,"I get why Walden is beloved by so many of us: it is the antithesis of American capitalist society. It confronts, with remarkable courage and aggression, head on, the very ""progresses"" and prosperity that so many Americans consider to be the foundation of this country and even of the American Dream. And it is an ode to nature at the dawn of the beginning of a shameful era of nature's accelerated destruction.But it was hard to swallow; in fact, too hard. I was not able to get past Chapter 3. If Thoreau could have passed himself off as a man of the world with wisdom and credibility this book would be radically more appealing. However I fear Walden to be the writing of a bitter, angry, social pariah-come-misanthrope. So, to employ an analogy of our own times, it is difficult for me to accept one man's statement of the meaninglessness of mainstream society when the man is about as socially attuned as Noam Chomsky or Glenn Beck.I'll stick to Emerson."
3,I want to like it,"First of all, the Kindle Annotated edition itself is fine. The extensive annotations really help me understand the work itself. My frustration is with the book. I had never read it before and guess I didn't know what to expect. I found the book very dry and his descriptions of his life and philosophies to have little in common with my views on environmental conservation. I'll put this in the ""books you need to say you've read"" and leave it at that."
5,A Leaf on the Cover,"Well, I haven't exactly gotten around to reading the book yet. It's um...right there. I can see it now. I um, I plan on reading it though, I really do. I can't remember the reason I bought it in the first place...saw it in a movie maybe. Idk. That's Amazon for ya. ...OoO a piece of candy..OoO a piece of candy...OoO a piece of candy..."
3,Long-winded,"Thoreau, I dig your ideas, you old hippy, but learn to be concise. I don't need to read 30+ pages on how you fell in love with a beaver."
2,Good Author...Marginal Editor,"I'm not super educated so take this for what it's worth. I read an excerpt of Walden in High School and ever since then I have wanted to read more. I finally got around to it and ordered this edited version. I like Thoreau's outlook even though his writing is a little much for me sometimes. McKibben does footnote some things to explain them. Most of those footnotes, though, are worthless. Some only refer to the other copyright information that Thoreau eludes to (or quotes). And worse even still is when McKibben puts in personal opinions and 'tree-hugger' facts to support what appears to be his agenda of conservation.His editing footnotes really had a poor impact on the book. What would have been useful for a 'hick' from Wyoming would have been some more translations of French words and explanations of references and ideas. That would have made the story much easier to read/understand and enjoy."
2,Like panning for gold...,"...you have to sift through a lot.Thoreau has some really great, original ideas and approaches to life. He has whole sections that seem incredibly tangential but after you reread them, you realize they were perhaps the greatest parts of the book.That being said, he also has sections that are just incredibly tangential, and when you finish you miss things like narratives, a centered topic, main points, etc. These are just stream of consciousness it seems."
3,An good work,"This one is long and boring. It was hard to get through, and it is largely repetative. Thoreau, considered the first enviromentalist, writes about his 2 year experiences in Walden Woods, on the pond. Thoreau stresses simplicity and individualism, as most transcendentalist,the latest philisophical literary movement,did. The well read reader should read this one to say that they have read Walden."
3,Tedious,"There was plenty of good, profound philosophy in this book. Thoreau made many wise observations and commentaries throughout the book. Unfortunately, these were all buried under heaps of gibberish. ""Blah blah I used X many nails to build my house blah blah the ground here is soft blah blah...."" and so on. I couldn't care less about the wildlife, or the ecological systems of Walden pond; if I had wanted that I would have read a science book. I wonder if Thoreau liked the sound of his own voice. But one thing's certain: he liked the look of his own writing. This book was 3 parts filler for every part philosophy, and that's being generous to Henry David."
2,obviously not a thriller,"this book is very similar to something dickens might have written.it has a serious tone that becomes a monotonous drone when it describes something and can be quite flavorless at times. i gave it two stars because the structure is better than grocery store romance garbage, but not something i could imaging anyone finding remotely fascinating."
3,Boring...........,"I don't know how people can call this book a brilliant ""American classic."" I rarely enjoyed reading this book, and it took me quite a while to finish because I could never bring myself to sit down and read it. Once in a while, Thoreau offers some nice insight, but the majority of this book just describes his mundane daily activities, and then he goes off on a tangent seemingly trying to find something ""deep"" in it. Thoreau shows his writing ability to be very established, as he can go off for pages about the most petty things, but often it seemed he was just trying to show off his Latin or his knowledge of the Vedas. He found the need to write every Latin quote in both Latin AND English. I did read the English version for a reason. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they are reallly bored."
4,Make sure you want an Annotated version,I purchased this book after reading another version and Walden as a piece of literature is an amazing work. I got the Annotated one because I wanted to learn more about Thoreau's world but found the annotations distracted from the actual writing. What was contained in the annotations was very interesting but I'm not sure how much they added for me.
2,Boring; Induced sleep in me.,"I found this book to be quite boring, and it took me a long time to finish reading it. I did find it interesting, however, as the author's personality does seem to change and become quite ""different"" the longer he was in seclusion from mainstream life. Other than that, I would not recommend this book, unless someone has insomnia and needs to fall asleep."
2,"Thought I could read it, but was mistaken!","While I'm sure this is a great work of liturature that I should read, I was unable to get through it.....Maybe some day in the future, but not now."
2,Read the Book!,"I have to disagree with the positive reviews above, but I'll admit I don't generally enjoy audio books and I couldn't get through much of this one.The first problem for me is that it is Walden Lite. In the parts I listened to while following along in the text, all Thoreau's references and comments on mythology, history, etc. were eliminated. No doubt that makes it simpler to read and listen to, but it's not Walden. If you're not up to dealing with the whole book, just get a book of Thoreau quotes...don't listen to this and think you've heard Walden.The biggest issue I had was that I simply didn't like the voice of the actor reading. It's hard to say why exactly, but I think I found it too high-pitched and affected. Never had the pleasure of hearing HDT's own voice of course, but I like to imagine it a lot more down to earth than this one."
1,This is an incomplete version.,As other reviewers have noted this version is incomplete and sentences stop in the middle. It was free. My only expense was the time and effort put into discovering the shortcomings of this version.
1,It hurts to read,"Why would any one want to read this book on their own accord? I found it to be the worst book in history. It's nothing more than a bunch of jumbled up statements that say one thing and deny it the next. He just repeated everything and since he couldn't make it in society, he moved to the woods. Is this supposed to show us how we are to live our lives, because if it is, shoot me now. He seemed to hate everyone and live with the animals and the pond. No one really cares what he ate or what he did for fun (if he can call it that), or how he failed in everything. If he wanted to find out who he was, he should've become a buddhist monk or something. I've seen someone else who left society and moved to the woods, and he is locked away for a long time for sending people bombs in the mail."
1,This was not a fun book,Do not read this book. This guy must have been stoned when he was in his cabin.
1,Torture,"Henry David Thoreau's Walden is one of the most hypercritical, boring, repeatitive book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. He's completlely contridicts himself or repeats the same idea in a different form.Look at me; I'm a famous writer. I'm a famous write; look at me. Look at me, the famous writer. Me you will look at; the famous writer. Me the famous writer, you will look at.It goes on, and then he talks about beans and ants. Just horrid...it literally hurts to read."
1,An Entirely New Level,"Henry David Thoreau did something truly magical in Walden. He brought boredom to an entirely new level I never knew existed. The amount of pointless and extraneous details that overflowed the pages of the book never ceased to amaze me.I was forced to read the book for an english class. My life has never been the same since. Thoreau's brilliant writing technique has allowed me to realize the full potential of other ""books."" I often find myself engrossed in the phone book or the dictionary, which have become suspenseful thrillers in comparison to Walden."
1,it is the worst book that I have EVER read,"This is most definitely the worst book that I have ever read. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. If you would like to know what it is about, i can tell you right now: it is a book about nothing.Thoreau goes on and on for ages, and he isn't really talking about anything..."
4,A Study of the Beauty of Nature.,"Thoreau was an American naturalist and Walden is his meticulously kept record of the phenomena in nature that he observed. He espouses the benefits of nature as well as the healing properties of simple toil and the benefits of rugged independence. Thoreau's mantra of ""Simplify, Simplify, Simplify"" has become pertinent again and again over the years since he wrote this little book. The book is an excellent nature book as well. Thoreau spent hours observing nature, and wrote about it with a simple and beautiful prose. Thoreau spent two years at the pond Walden. This book covers his observations during that time."
4,Good read to consider alternative perspecives on issues of life,It was interesting how many of the issues discussed in this book are relevant to today even though it was written 150 years ago. It took a bit of getting used to the long sentences and sorting out the thought processes originally but once I developed a comfort with the writing style it made the story come alive.
2,Worth reading,An interesting picture of the writer and his times. Not sufficiently gripping to retain me for the last 25%. But worth reading.
5,A Favorite,The first work I've read by Thoreau. Captures the beauty of simplicity. Looks inward instead of outward to find value.
4,Easy to download,Easy to download. Book is okay. Use on my iPad and Ipod and iPhone. That is convenient. Tata for now.
5,Great if you don't care about order,"Forget about the order of titles published on the liner--the songs are in a different order on the disc--and just listen. Wolly Bully is on virtually every ""best of the 1960's"" CD, but there are a lot of other great (and some so-so) Sam the Sham numbers here. The audio is great. So, put the convertible top down, put on some shades, skip ahead to ""Ring Dang Do"" and curise by the nearest High School and let those insufferable preppies know what real ""cool"" is."
4,A Little Too Complete,This CD has everything your looking for in a Sam the Sham and the Pharaos CD. If you've only heard Wooly Bully you are missing out. The problem is there are so many songs that you can't just listen to the whole thing right through. Indiviually they may all be great but together they start sounding the same. I have this CD and am happy with it. But I'd recomend just getting the 20th Century - Millenium collection Sam the Sham and the Pharaos CD. I has all of the good songs.
4,Cost effective,"On the plus side, this is a high quality lube for a more than reasonable price. I object to this quote from the product description: ""lubricating females before breeding"" because it is sexist and narrow-minded. Not all sex is for procreation, even if my Lord suggests it should be. I'm human and I do have desires. Who among us doesn't? (Please, no more emails from monks and nuns - aren't you ""holier than thou"" types supposed to shun modern technology anyway?) I do not intend to be ""bred"" and I think you would find more females inclined to agree with my point of view. The whole feminist movement is alive, but not so well - and we women need to do something about it. But back to this cheap but excellent lube - they need to come up with a more marketable name."
4,Really like this shirt!,"This is a well-designed and constructed shirt of 100% cotton. The material and design imprint really look great. The fit is very good. It does require ironing, as it wrinkles fairly easily, regardless of how it is washed and dryed. The price was very competitive."
5,My husband's favorite shirt,"My husband wanted some variety in his short-sleeve shirts, so we decided to try a Hawaiian shirt. He says it is the most comfortable shirt he owns. We live in Arkansas, where it is terribly hot and humid all summer. He says this shirt ""breathes"" and keeps him cool."
1,"Stiff, wrinkled like a cheap pillow case","Washed it in cold water, blead lots of red out. Came out of the washer wrinkled, I dried it on low, still completely wrinkled, and stiff. It's like wearing a plastic bag and as noisy. Bad cut. No shoulder room, baggy and not tapered like in the picture. Waste of money. I guess I could cut it up for rags ?"
1,Just a Frazetta's shadow.,Hoffman's work is just a pale imitation of Frazetta's talent. Being myself an artist I cannot understand why people that is already established in the art field keep trying to copy somebody else's work. It is probably fine when you star your career but after a while the logical path is to follow your own style. As an artist doesn't he fell ashamed? I certainly would. I recommend you to get a Frazetta's books first.
4,Slimquick Extreme,"This is a good product, and I think it really increases my metabolism. It has a good balance of a lot of different ingredients which other products lack, and it seems to go to work quickly! I am reordering it!"
5,AMAZING SERIES,"It was my neighbor who got me hooked on this author. I thanked her..I have all the books. I never laugh so much in each any everyone of her books....love morelli,ranger and grandma mazur, she has some great lines. I can not wait for the movie to come out next year. The trailers are great. I wonder if anyone likes the cast or not? I was not sure but the more and more I saw the trailer...it fits. Some people wanted Sandra Bullock to play Stephanie. I know a guy that actuaLLy has read these books. I was shocked but to each his own. I think that Stephanie should end up with Morelli, not that Ranger is not hot and a bad boy. You have to love Lula, she has some great lines....Her and Stephanie make a great team. I just finished 17 and waiting Explosive 18 which I have pre-ordered. All the views who wrote good things are spot on. Those who did not like it well I quess you don't have a sense of humor."
5,Love at first reading!,"I love reading mysteries,and I am surprised that I am just now reading about Stephanie Plum. This was delightful! Funny,yet full of suspense. I'm not sure who I like better,Stephanie or her mother!"
4,ONE FOR THE MONEY 1st of the Stephanie Plum series,It is good and fills in several gaps if you started later in the series. It introduces all the cast of major players to come later. All-in-all a good book for people who like the series. Evanovich has not really hit her stride here but presents a good nucleus for a very entertaining series.
4,Will Have Me Back for More,"Excellent start to a series - lead character is strong, Evanovich knows the climate of the city she is writing about, the secondary characters all are real and have some depth, and the plot is pretty good too. In fact, the ending is not an easy one to figure out along the way. I'll definitely read more of this series now that I've started with One for the Money."
5,"Entertaining, easy read!","This was the first Evanovich book that I have read and I am so glad that I did! One of my girlfriends recommended that I read this, saying that she liked it so much she was up to number eight in the series. For a Jersey Girl like me, it is entertaining because the entire series takes place in NJ, making it familiar. Evanovich also doesn't add any NJ stereotypes which can be appreciated by true NJ residents! As a character, you immediately side with Stephanie and hope that she succeeds as a bounty hunter. The other characters add more suspense leaving you guessing until the very end. I read this in two days and would have finished it sooner but I had to work and go to sleep. If you are looking for something to fun and easy to read-this is your book!"
5,The book that starts it all!,Book one reels you in and you're hooked from there on! Finished this book and immediatlely ordered the next one. Highly recommend to all! My great grandma also loves this series! ENJOY!
4,Loved the books...bummed about the movie casting,Love this character so much! Easy read...brain candy. Have read the whole series and was so disappointed to see they cast Katherine Heigl!!! Really??? Stephanie Plum is such a great character and can not see this twit in the role. Probably won't see the movie because I don't want her to ruin Stephanie for me.
5,One for the money,One For The Money is a mistrey book and it is about a girl named stephnie plum and she lost her job her car and she is out of money.She goes to her cousin for a job as a bountie hunter and starts here work.There are a few twists and turns in this book and that is what is so good about the book.I enjoyed it and i know you will to.
2,Wanted to love it but...,"This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me."
2,I could do without ....,"the detailed descriptions of how Benito brutalized and raped women with broken beer bottles etc- after all, who needs these images in their head? Isn't the nighly news enough? Also, the crude language and setting just gives me an ugly feeling. That said, I liked Stephanie and her sense of humor, but I'm not sure I would read more of the series. The fact that these are bestsellers just proves to me that society is getting more and more depraved."
1,"Not funny, sad","I read 2/3 of it before putting it down for good. I truly gave it a chance.However, as other readers pointed out, this book is way too sexist for my taste. Perhaps the author thought she might be adding titillation by adding sexual content, but what came out is poorly executed sadism. The characters are cardboard, and the main character, Stephanie Plum, is just another -oh-I'm-so-clumsy-let-me-bat-eyelashes-and-get-what-I-want-because-I-want-to-be-a-tough-girl of those chick lit heroines.I'm a Sue Grafton fan also, but what I found here was a poor imitation, a dumbed-down version with even shorter words and slapstick humor."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I found this to be boring, insulting, and obnoxious. I was looking for something light when I purchased this, but this was too dumbed down for my taste."
5,good,good book love her books trying to read all in this series got really quick this is a excellent series
3,Good.,Good book. Well written. Enjoy the different people that the story is about . Will read the rest of the books.
2,Phaaa,"The books got stellar reviews so I figured there must be something to all the hype. I got through One for the Money and admit I was drawn in at times, the book definitely does not drag and it does have its chuckle to yourself moments. I just didn't think it was that funny or that good to warrant such praise. The goofy humor that is in this book, like when Stephanie lets her senile grandma play with her gun at the dining room table and grandma shoots a hole in the chicken did not seem to jive with the brutal violence depicted in scenes. I even willed myself into the second book because I was sure at any moment the ""magic"" was going to sweep me off my feet and suck me in. It just never happened for me."
5,One for the money,I just like the way the action in her books are. It's an easy read and holds your interest. I can usually read the whole book in three days when I have the time.
3,A Good Read,"For the most part, I enjoyed the story and the plot. The characters were well developed and interacted realistically. The major problem I had with it is the (to me) graphic violence against woman. I tend to be sensitive to that, and Stephanie Plum found herself in a bad situation twice. There are two other problems I had with it. First, Stephanie seems to be reaching beyond her grasp - she's very lucky not to have gotten killed. She's not good at apprehending criminals. Second, there was a lot of repetition of her getting dressed. Nearly every chapter had at least one scene consisting of several phrases describing what she was putting on. For me, it was a little tedious. Even though I won't read another, I still think it's a good read overall."
3,One for the Money,"This book was entertaining, fast-paced and funny. However, I think that the author could have made the violence much less graphic and not affected the plot at all. If not for the descriptions of violence, I would have given this book five stars. I think I will try reading the next book in the series, but if it disturbs me as much as this one did, it will be my last. I do not have to be shocked to be entertained."
4,meet Stephanie Plum...novice bounty hunter,"This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum mystery series. Here we find out how Stephanie becomes a bounty hunter (desperation and no money). Advised to catch the villian and not investigate, Stephanie breaks that rule because the man she has to bring in was one of her childhood friends.This book is enjoyable, doesn't take itself too seriously and is a good introduction to the world Stephanie lives in. The most outright funny character in the book is her Grandmother. While I found it amusing, this is not laugh out loud material. Still, it's good enough to make me want to read book 2 in the series."
5,I've given this book as a gift and everyone always loves it!,"I live in New Jersey and I can tell you that the characters in this book are very, very possibly real people! These Stephanie Plum books are FUNNY! My friends resisted this book when I told them about it, but when they read it for themselves, they LOVED it---especially the people who grew up in the Trenton, NJ area.My seventeen-year-old daughter put aside her summer activities to go right through this book. She admitted that it was much more enjoyable that the books on her required reading list.I have given this book as a gift and everyone loves it! I have lent my own copies of her books, one to five, to people and they got hooked and started buying the rest themselves. All of them were surprised how enjoyable it was! The idea of a bounty hunter isn't that appealing, but Stephanie Plum is one appealing character.I am about to read her latest book and I can't wait."
2,Talk about your crap movie of the week book......,"How could anyone rate this book with 5 stars? It was poorly written, filled with cliches and the characters were not at all likeable or redeeming. Put this on the back shelf and only read if you are desperate."
1,Is it me?,"I wanted to like this book. If I liked it, then I'd have all those sequels to look forward to. But I couldn't get past the first chapter. Glib, smart-alecky, first-draft-feeling, it just felt too loose and unedited, un-thought-out. No style. More like a boilerplate for people wanting to make a quick buck writing easy paperback mysteries. I skipped around in the book after that, but nothing caught my attention. I even finally read the last few pages, but all I realized was that I would never be able to endure this character for a whole book, much less a whole series. Stephanie Lemon, I'd say."
4,Fun in the sun,"This was a great fun read for the beach. I loved all the characters in this book. This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it. It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed."
1,Too dumb to live,"Evanovich is a wonderful writer, giving a great sense of place and well drawn characters. But Stephanie Plum? Oy! I wanted to throw the book across the room. She drags an injured woman through her apartment window? Even a high school student would know better. She hears, on the phone, a man whose identity she knows torturing a woman. Does she call the police? No. She plugs in her answering device. Dozens of other utterly absurd actions show her to be a total [mindless person]. She is so stupid that she becomes a primary cause of another person being shot!I must say this is the absolute worst book of its kind I have ever read."
4,New to the Plum Series,"This is my first Sephanie Plum novel--I actually tried reading the first book first for a change. I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to James Patterson fans as well, for a good read.The main character, Stephanie Plum, is wonderful--very real and funny. The situations she gets herself into are not realistic, but that's all part of the fun. Lots of interesting twists and Stephanie gets hersef in and out of trouble.I'd recommend this book, and will be reading others in this series."
3,Literary equivalent of cotton candy,"Light and fluffy with no nutritional value. Stephanie Plum is ridiculously stupid, constantly putting herself in harm's way and being rescued by Ranger (ex-military bounty hunter who mentors her) and Joe Morelli, the guy she's trying to capture. Morelli's a vice cop charged with murder. He's also an old crush of hers and a ladies' man. Try as I might to hate him, he was the most interesting character. (I might have liked Ranger more if I'd gotten to see more of him.) If I read the second book, it will be for more of Morelli, not Stephanie Plum."
4,"Funny, Easy Read","I am always surprised at how harshly some judge books. There are some truly terrible books out there. This is not one of them.The author uses the perfect voice for her character. The plot is pretty good. The setting allows for some very funny scenes. There were parts of the book that made me uncomfotable, though I don't think Evanovich went into too much graphic detail.Overall, I think it was well written and funny. If you're looking for something thought provoking and deeply sentimental, this isn't it. If you're looking for entertainment and a few laughs (and you don't take yourself too seriously), you might like this book."
3,one for the money,This book started off pretty slow for me but got better after half way through. It definately wasn't the best book I've read but good enough to make me want to read the second one.
4,Well-written story about a woman turned bounty hunter,"Stephanie Plum is broke. She is desperate. Once she learns that she can make $10,000 as a bounty hunter, she decides to learn the tricks of the trade. Her first task is to bring in Joe Morelli, someone from her past. Now he's a cop accused of murder and presently, on the lamb. Stephanie learns the trade the hard way as we follow her foibles and mishaps, yet there is something endearing about her obstinate attitude. In search of Joe, she gets mixed up with a sadistic boxer, his manager, two call girls, and a butcher. Evanovich, the author, writes superbly with a tight plot and witty prose. A fun read that doesn't disappoint you!"
4,wow,i am an avid reader of james patterson's books but i decided to venture off and read a new author when this book landed in my hands. this book was a really quick read....the pages just kept turning. i couldnt put it down. the storyline just kept you guessing and wanting to read more. if you like this book then you should really read a book by james patterson!
1,BOOK BOUGHT IN TERRIBLE CONDITION!,"I JUST BOUGHT AND RECEIVED THIS BOOK IN THE MAIL AND IT'S IN SUCH BAD CONDITION; I DON'T EVEN WANT TO READ IT....I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT NEW FOR LESS MONEY, AND NOT WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT....IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION! BALONEY.DON'T BELEIVE IT."
1,One who is addicted to these books,I have read all twelve of Janet's books in the Stephanie Plum series and I am absolutely hooked and am waiting for her latest book to be available in January of 2007. I never used to be an avid reader until I started these books. If you want some light reading that keeps you laughing at the antics of some of the characters these books are for you! I love the way Janet makes these characters seem so real.
1,Awful,"I had heard a great deal about how wonderfully humourous this series is, so I decided to start with book number one. What a mistake. I am not amused by either junior high humour or violence against women. I found this to be a dreadul book with a sophomoric plot and a degrading, violent, abusive view of women. I did not finish it and will never read another book by this author. I stongly suggest no one else do so, either."
5,Best Book Series!!!,I love these books!!! I have never found a series of books that i liked so much!!! Cant put them down!!!! Wonderful Wonderful Stories!!!
2,kmb,Estremely sad for all the vulgar gutter language and poor taste of speech that added nothing to the plot nor story. The story could have been interesting otherwise but this depleted its message. I am saddened over ordering it and will not be reading any of her other books.
1,Poorly Written,"I am an avid reader of this genre, and was excited to begin a new series and bond with a new heroine. Unfortunatly the level of writing was poor, and I do not intend to read any more of this author's books. This book was written at a high-school reader's level, but with adult content. In my opinion a bad combination."
3,Not as good as i thought,"Well all I hear about is how these books are so great. Well I wasn't that impressed with it. The beginning was Pretty good and the ending was alright but the middle of the book, just plain ol boring. I heard the books start to get better after the first so hopefully they aren't as bad as the first."
5,I love the book. I would love to listen to the audio.,"When I first meet the Stephanie Plum Serise, I was so intreged by what she went through into becoming a bounty hunter. What a thrill, and to have 2 wonderful guys looking out for her, and she knows how to be tuff and soft all at once. She is a good bounty hunter in books. I wonder if she is real?"
4,Enjoyable - quick and easy to read ... look forward to reading more ..,"Stephanie Plum makes a terrific main character - she is far from perfect but is brave and funny and hard-working. The characters of this book were its strength - some were creepy, others intense, some were down-right scary, and some you really had to root for! The mystery of the book wasn't clear for me for a good part of the book but by the final third I put the pieces in order and was starting to think through the mystery along with Stephanie. The physical danger she was in, and the horrible abusive boxer really made me uncomfortable (good writing Janet Evanovich!) There was a twist that caught me at the end (I love that!). I will certainly seek out more Stephanie Plum books!"
4,Reading with Tequila,"If you want to start the Stephanie Plum series, One for the Money is an essential read. In this novel, you get all the background information needed to understand the rest of books that follow. Janet Evanovich is very good about making sure the reader knows the major reasons behind some of Stephanie Plum's references, but here you get to see the transformation from unemployed Stephanie to bounty hunter Stephanie. It is very humorous."
4,Great Fun,Janet Evanovich writes with a nonchalance that works wonderfully especially with her characters. This casual manner is hilarious as Stephanie Plum runs pell-mell through the novel. And Plum consistently stays in character all the way down to buying a blender for a free daiquiri mix when she can't afford to pay utilities. Well done! A fast and very fun time!
5,Excellent reading!,"Targeted for mainly women, this book hits home for many. Hilarious, riveting, suspenseful, romantic and completely on a true to live scale. This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time! KUDOS to Janet."
4,First book in excellent series,"Stephanie Plum goes to work for her cousin, Vinnie, as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment, worth $10,000 is to bring in Joe Morelli who is a cop accused of murder. She and Joe have a past (fleeting though it may be) but she is determined to bring him in. She runs into him quite a bit but he doesn't ""let"" her catch him. The characterization is great and there are a few laughs. I have read the whole series and they only get better and better and laugh out loud funny. This is one of my favorite series. Stephanie and Joe's relationship alone will keep you turning the pages."
4,Stephanie Plum Novels are sooooo fun,"If you want a quick read, fun that will make you laugh it is this unpredictable accidental Bounty Hunter, I bought the first 4 to go on vacation, now coming back to get the rest."
4,YOUR MONEY'S WORTH!,"After finishing 10 BIG ONES, I needed another Janet fix. Dug up my copy of One.....and sat down to enjoy all over.Just as funny the second time. Loved seeing the crew again. Ranger was great and Joe Morelli was SO good. The scene with Steph handcuffed to the bathtub and Ranger rescues her...... Ya gotta love it.This series is a hoot. All funny characters to be followed all the way thru. Just one good time! It's a feel good book without being sappy. Waiting for her newest....."
4,One for the Money,A very entertaining idea. The book is filled with interesting characters that you want to know more fully. I will probably be ordering more Stepanie Plum books in the future.
5,Funny as Hell!!,Really GREAT book! Action Packed! twists and turns.. I highly recommend. Very whitty style of writing. I am exctied to get on with the rest of the series.
3,"A good, fun, fast read.","This book is literary fluff at its finest. Nothing deep and heart-wrenching here. Instead, it's a refreshing, fun swim in shallow water. Peppered with plenty of humor and with the knowledge our heroine, Stephanie, never seems in any REAL danger, we enjoy her balls of brass, her family and ""colleagues"", and hope for an equal quantity of lighthearted entertainment in the rest of this series. Three books later, I haven't been disappointed."
3,Don't see what all the fuss is about,"I got this book to see what the Stephanie Plum character would bring to the genre of the female detective novel. As is turns out, not much. Mild wisecracks, ""quirky"" relatives and ""you-gotta-be-kidding"" situations are thrown against the wall to see what sticks As it turns out, the only thing that happened was two crimes: I was robbed and my time was killed."
4,One for the Money,One for the MoneyEntertaining and funny. Kept me wanting to read more. Pretty good light book for the beach.
5,Great series,Note if you watch the movie 1st do not expect the book to be a lot like it and vs versus. Good fun read so enjoy the series
4,Fun Easy Read,"This book was a fun, easy read. I laughed alot and it held my interest. You can't help but like the main character."
5,Funny,This author is great. The character has a funny sense of humor and it is a joy to read. Packaged well.
4,Easy Reading,"It was an easy book to read, not too many characters to keep track of. The characters were likeable and easy to relate to."
4,Fun Read,What a delightful book! This is the first of a series...I can hardly wait to read more about the adventures of Stephanie Plum.
5,Love humorous mysteries?,The first Stephanie Plum novel blew me away with the humor. Now I've read them all. Try Janet Kole's Suggestion of Death for a similarly amusing mystery.Suggestion of Death
3,Funny and Shocking,"A fun, fast-paced detective/thriller. The main character, Stephanie, is very real, giving us a great reminder of the suburbs in the 80's. Evanovich uses humor throughout the book to lighten the many depressing and frightening situation Stephanie gets into. If there is a complaint about the book it is that sometimes the situations are so awful that the humor seems out of place. Still, if you are looking for a great escapist book, this would be a superb choice."
5,Stephanie Rocks!,"I read this book a while ago, but was reminded of it with the new movie coming out. I totally disagree with their casting choices, btw, but what can you do? This book, however, is great. It has a lot of action, suspense, and humor. It is really fast-paced as other reviewers have pointed out. Such a page turner! The thing I like most about this book and the others in the series is that they are pure escapism. I don't feel stressed while reading them at all. One for the Money is the perfect book to read in bed with a good cup of tea at your side :) I'd recommend it to anyone --- and have!"
5,So Funny...,"In One for the Money we meet the charming if a little batty Stephanie Plum. She doesnt have life figured out but she will get through it with a little dumb luck and help from friends. We meet the people in her life who sometimes steal the show, i'm talking about Grandma Mazur, she is a fire cracker. The book was a fun read and a real page turn when the action gets going."
5,Excellent book; excellent series,"This book is the start of a terrific series. It hooked me from the first sentence. If you like a little romance, a lot of humor and a great mystery, you've just found it."
5,Plum Wonderful!,"My first Stephenie Plum book was 7 Up. Laughed all the way through it. After I finished I knew I had to catch up with the whole series. So I ordered 1, 2, a package deal of 3, 4, 5 & 6 and have never enjoyed a series of books so much. All wonderful. Mailed them, as I finished, to my daughter in New Hampshire who is sending them back as she finishes them so that my husband can find out what we are laughing about when we talk on the phone."
2,Abridged means the good parts are goone,"I am new to the books on cd so I didn't realize that abridged meant they took what they considered the unessential parts out. That means all the humor, all the real meat of Ms Evanovich's style are gone and you get just another action story to fall asleep to at night. I loved the book and wanted to share the story with my daughter who doesn't have time to read but likes to listen to the stories on her way to work. I am embarressed to give this to her after I have raved about the author's writing because it is just dull. Why would anyone put out something so disappointing. I noticed they have all been abridged and while I was ready to start buying all of them, now I will not be buying any more. Enjoy the books but do not expect much from the audio cds."
4,you WILL laugh yourself silly,"I was in the library and I asked the librarian if she had any books that would be just a fun relaxing read. I read a lot of heavy literature and history so I wanted something that wouldn't emotionally or intellectually drain me. I can't tell you how much this book fit the bill!!! (My friends and family agree). This book is so funny and entertaining. There's something so quintessentially American about it.Stephanie Plum is a great modern heroine, her love interest vice-cop Morelli is very sexy, and the other characters Janet Evanovich creates are similarly wacky and endearing. Sometimes she goes a little overboard with ethnic stereotyping, but her heart's in the right place and I don't know how she turned the story of an inept female bounty-hunter from Jersey into a book that you can't put down, but she did.I'm quite positive the vast majority of readers will be delighted!!!"
3,Fun Read,"My friend convinced me to read One for the Money. It was a fun read. Not the best mystery I've read, but well worth the read. The lead character is a little under developed, but it works for the novel. I'm looking forward to reading Two for the Show."
5,Wonderful mystery series!,"I've been searching for a new female detective series and I've definitely found it! The descriptions of the Stephanie Plum series intrigued me. Then luckily (?) I caught the flu and actually had time to read the first two books. I finished both in two days. I loved the rapport between Stephanie and the other residents of Trenton, New Jersey. Having lived in New Jersey for a year, the descriptions rang perfectly true, of the people, the town, the ATTITUDES! I loved it! Now I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
4,This book made me laugh out loud!,"I enjoyed ""One for the Money"" very much. Being a ""Kinsey Malone"" fan, I had a hard time accepting a new heroine. The beginning of the book presented some pretty zany stuff, like grandma shooting the chicken, but once I got past that, I found myself engrossed in the story and at times laughing out loud. I immediately orded the next two in the series. NJL"
5,Can't put it down!,"I bought this book months ago and hesitated to read it, until last weekend. Exhausted and trying to sleep, I picked it up before bed, thinking I'd read two chapters. I was up all night finishing it! Wonderful characters!"
1,Bored,"I was looking forward to a series of books that so many seemed to enjoy. However, I am slogging through One for the Money. It is so slow moving and the characters are flat, lack charm or any other appeal. I don't think I am going to be able to finish the book"
1,A movie is being made??????????,"What the heck, this book, like all her others, really stinks. Janet's books are so stupid it's embarassing to be seen reading them."
2,"It's disgusting (to me, anyway) - but violence sells.",I was really enjoying this light and funny book until I got to the graphic descriptions of violence against women. Don't we get enough of that at the movies? I threw the book away.
2,Two stars for completing the book,I first saw the author on Sunday morning getting interviewed in New Jersey. Apparently she was a big success. I bought the first book and read it and passed it on to my friends. None of us liked it at all. Compared to what is out there this is weak. She does do an excellent job of describing New Jersey it is an awful place. I didn't like the main character or any of the others. The grandmother had potential but was highly unlikely as written. The reason for the success of Who wants to be a Millionaire-which I absolutely don't like and the success of this book may be the missing link to all of it. Sue Grafton or J.A. Jance are phenomenally better.
1,NEVER READ,I had just recently purchased a KINDLE reader BUT could establish any link. After several attempts I returned the KINDLE to the store. Never had a chance to read the book. Thanks
5,Great new style of writing,"This such a down to earth book that its refreshing from the normal romance/ mystery. Very glad someone said this is a fabulous read because since I starting reading this book, everyone who sees me reading these books just raves about the entire series. Grandma Mazur and Ranger are who I hear about the most and I cant wait to see how it all unfolds."
3,"GOOD BOOK,BUT NOT GREAT!","This book came highly recommended to me. I thought it was good,but I had a probelm with some of the things Stephanie did. I couldn't believe her naivete when trying to apprehend the FTA'S(FAILURE TO APPEAR). The story was funny and extremely entertaining, if not very believable. I found myself laughing out loud during many parts. This book reminded me of when I watched the movie PULP FICTION, because it tapped into a very dark disturbing world and yet it had moments that were very funny. I will try the next story in the series and see if I like that one better."
5,Stephanie Plum,I really enjoy all of the Plum stories but this is my favorite because it was the start of the series.
2,Skip One and start with Two...,"Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the series, and cannot wait for each new book. But, I recommend to my friends that they skip the first book and start with Two or Three. They'll meet the characters just fine without the first one.In my opinion, the first book is too 'raw.' The sex and violence are too graphic. To me, it seemed that the author wasn't certain what sort of book she wanted to write. By the second or third in the series, she hit her stride and got more comfortable with her own characters and genre. But the first in the series just isn't comfortable in its own skin.Enjoy the series, though! It's a hoot! I live in NJ and work in Trenton, and love the ""local"" references."
4,Go Stephanie Plum,"I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet. I would see my boss read and just start laughing! So, I picked up the first book...Wish I hadn't waited so long.The writing style is engaging and the pace is fast. I read it in one day! Because, I had a very hard time putting the book down. When the book ended, I went to the store and got the second book and order 4-7 on amazon. I plan on grabbing the rest too.It's easy to see why this series is so popular. The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light, and FUNNY reading. I'm looking forward to reading the rest and cann't wait to get them.BUY IT! READ IT! AND LAUGH!!!"
5,Great book!,"I loved it. The characters are wonderful, especially Stephanie and Grandma. I recommend it to everyone who loves mystery, and humor."
4,"Not Grafton, but not bad, either.","Stephanie Plum is what Kinsey Millhone might have looked like if she'd grown up in New Jersey instead of Santa Teresa. While to some degree Evanovich seems like another Grafton copycat, she has enough originality and style to have her own voice. I'd rank Stephanie Plum on par with Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado and slightly above Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski, but Kinsey Millhone is still the female P.I. queen."
5,Just like chocolate: can't (read) eat just one,"What a fun experience to read a book where the characters are rounded and realistic. Our Heroine, Stephanie Plum has bad hair days, slouchy clothes (not always designer lines) and a quirky job she happens to fall into. The pages turn quickly and the last page leaves you wanting more. Thankfully, Ms. Evanovich has a couple more after ""One for the Money"", but she must write faster to satisfy me!Stephanie Plum gets downsized at a lingerie factory. Her family ""encourages"" her to seek employment from her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman who needs a file clerk. Stephanie ends up on his payroll, but as a bounty hunter not a file clerk. Her adventures send her all around the ""burg"" in Trenton, New Jersey. The results are exploding, tense, empathetic and all around fun. Send us more Janet"
2,a little to slow for me.,I really tired to get into this book but I couldnt get past chapter 4 or 5. I enjoy a good mystery or action book but there was way to much slow paced details for my taste. I couldnt finish it.
4,Stephanie Plum is an interesting Character.,One For the Money was a quick fun read. It is light and interesting. I will read more Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich.
4,Better than the movie,"Real characters, a decent plot with realistic consequences to both good and bad decisions made by a spunky cast. Over the top at times, but an enjoyable romp."
5,I laughed out loud!!!!,"Stephanie Plum is the type of high spirited, funny, and smart women that you'd love to have as a best friend! You just know that you'd always have fun hanging out with this Jersey girl!When Stephanie finds herself unemployeed and after she's liquidated all of her furnature she turns to ""Cousin Vinnie"" for a job as a bounty hunter. Even with no experience in the art of chasing down criminals she soon finds herself carrying a gun that she's afraid to use. No only that,but she finds herself in situations where she needs to protect herself. With a crazy stalker harassing her and the need to for her to rake in some cash by bringing a murderer in, the storie takes a more serious twist and I found myself unable to put it down.Kudos to you Janet Evanovich! You wrote a very refreshing hit and I can't wait to read the others! Very funny, yet suspensful! This one gets a rare 5 stars from this girl!!!!"
5,VERY ENTERTAINING MYSTERY,"I read this book because of the reviews right here at Amazon and wasn't disappointed. I've just started to read her second book, ""Two for the Dough"" and hope that it's as good as the first. To go from lingerie salesperson to bounty hunter is quite a jump, and Stephanie does it with humor and passion. I related to her selling her ""stuff"" just to survive - been there, done that. But her resilience was something the ""weaker sex"" should be proud of. GO GIRL!"
4,More women heroines!!,"Wonderfully full bodied & funny! I am a big fan of mystery - especially the women writers/characters, and this book was refreshing and extremely well crafted for a first novel. Stephanie Plumb is gutsy, interesting, fresh and still human. I laughed out loud many, many times. The supporting characters are well defined, deep and humorous as well. In this first book it finds Stephanie experiencing enough financial difficulties to force her to seek employment with her less than savory cousin Vinny, as a bounty hunter. Even with no experience, she plunges ahead in her new found career choice. Buy this one today and you will be rushing out to buy the next one as soon as you've read a couple chapters"
5,Funny and fast paced,"I did not get bored with this book at all. It sucks you right in and you don't want to put it down until you are done. Stephanie Plum is a hillarious character; you really feel like you get to know her. There is the mystery, the comedy, the romance, everything in one awesome book. A great start to the series. I will be reading the rest of them."
5,You WILL Laugh Out Loud,"I have found my new favorite author and fictional charactor. Stephanie Plum is intelligent, witty, funny, and vulnerable at the same time. The supporting charactors, especially Grandma Mazur, provide comic relief as Stephanie hunts down her man (or woman). Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series are simply put, excellent. Highly recommend grabbing all 8 books and go on a non-stop reading binge. You'll love it!"
4,I've found a new crime writer!,"Somehow I missed Evanovich's first crime novel when it was published eight years ago, but it has been a pleasant suprise. Looking for someone to fill in to the gaps as I wait for James Lee Burke, Carl Hiaasen, and Elmore Lenoard to publish new books, I picked up ""One For the Money"". It was an enjoyable and exciting read. I enjoyed watching Stephanie take on chasing bail skips as a new career and trying to avoid self destructing. I look forward to following her through later novels. Stephanie is certainly a peach, wait a minute, no she is a Plum."
5,A terrific story!,I couldn't put this one down. It was great. If you are looking for a laugh you have found it with this one. I think there is a little bit of Stephanie Plum in all of us - at least I like to think so! Read it - you will be glad you did.
2,V. Disappointed,"After hearing so many great things about Evanovich's series, I decided to start with the first one. I must say I was very disappointed. The quality of the writing made me feel like I was reading a romance novel, with non of the romance parts. In addition, although I must admit I did giggle a few times during the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, I also only give 1 star to books that I can not finish), I really could not stand Stephanie, the main character. I have read many wonderful books where you are supposed to hate the main character. This was not Evanovich's intention, however. This was a book where you were supposed to be on Stephanie's side the entire time. All I could think of the entire time was how pathetic she was. And not even in an interesting to read about pathetic type of way. Please do not waste your time or money on this book..."
2,Simplistic and boring,One of the most boring mystery/crime novels that I have read. It was predictable the language was uninspired. I would highly recommend Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly over this author.
3,Fun and Witty but.....,"This book was entertaining and witty but not much on the plot. It is good fluff read but if you are looking for a true mystery, this is not the book for you."
5,Couldn't put it down!,I read the majority of this book in one day. I just couldn't put it down. Great book...can't wait to read #2!
4,One for the money,"This is a VERY funny book. Very easy relaxing read, great beach book etc. I look forward to reading more of the Stephanie Plum novels and hope they are as good as the first. The grandmother is a HOOT!!"
5,Great Read!!,"I picked up the book at my friends urging at how great it was. I usually don't have much time for reading but I needed something to read on the plane so I thought I would give it a try. These books are addicting. Since the trip two months ago, I have read 1 through 6 of her books plus Full Bloom, and Manhunt. I love Janet Evanovih's writing style. It is just plain fun."
4,Great-Timeless,One for the Money- after reading the first one I am glad I found this great series to continue on with!
5,One for the money by Janet evanovich,I really enjoyed the humor as well as the story line of this book. A great read. Women can do anything they put their minds to...
4,Funny,"Recommended from a family member. Just fun reading, nothing intense, deep, or mind bending. Just fun that's it, and sometimes that's all you need."
3,One for the Money,"This is lightweight, but fun reading.The main character is intereting and the plot is different.A little far down-to-earth for some."
5,"very, very funny","Hmm... I always looked at a Janet Evanovich cover and think, this must be one of those bland female mysteries. Then one day, I met a fanatic of Evanovich who introduced me to the series, and I swear, I laugh and laughed. Stephanie is not the heroines where you want to marry, but rather one that you'd want a bottle of beer and and movie with."
4,"Very enjoyable reading if you like Grafton et. al.,","If you live in Trenton, NJ, you may recognize the landscape in the background. I don't and didn't. However the main character is vibrant and alive, and very life-like. I enjoyed it enough to buy Book 2. Evanovitch is one of the authors I look for now."
4,Fast paced and Stimulating!,"Evanovich's first of three books featuring Stephanie Plumb - Bounty Hunter is fast movining and riveting. Realistic problems face this lost female searching for identity while earning an income. Facing criticism from family, Plumb ""gears up"" with the able bodied assistance of a he-man bounty hunter and finds herself amidst adventure and fear. Great summer reading"
4,Very Interesting Characters With A Rushed Ending,"The first half of this book is great. The characters are quirky and entertaining, the mystery is involving, and the book moves along at a nice pace.The second half of the book is where things fall apart. One problem is that what I'd call the second half of the book is only 30 pages long. It's almost as if Evanovich was under pressure to wrap up the book and get it to the publisher. Now, this book isn't the first murder mystery to suffer from the ""Deus Ex Machina"" type of ending, and it's still a good read, just not up to a 5-star level.Then again, with this price and this genre, you're probably not looking for ""Dr. Zhivago"". It is what it is, and it delivers that well."
4,Not Really My Cup of Tea,"Stephanie Plum is out of work, her car has been reposessed, and she has no money. She resorts to eating dinner every, single night, at her parents home. Until of course she gets a job as a bounty hunter. All she needs to do is try and stay alive as she catches people who have jumped bail, and she'll collect $10,000. It sounds easier than it is. Her first job is to nail Joe Morelli. The person who nailed her when she was 16. You'd think it would be easy trying to nail someone whom you know (or knew), but with the sexual tension between the two of them, Stephanie may have bitten off more than she can chew. Way more.This was an interesting first mystery in the Stephanie Plum series. With all of the hoopla, I thought that this would be some sort of work of art, but I wasn't too impressed. My word of advice to potential readers: If you don't have a sense of humor, don't buy the book. The mystery takes somewhat of a backseat to the humor."
3,"a so-so story, with outstanding character development","I honestly did not follow the story line that carefully as i read this book. The reason for this is because I became so wrapped up in the character of Stephanie Plum. The book unfolded rather expectedly with Stephanie and Joe reuniting, but I really had a tough time making sense of the ending - especially the involvement of Jimmy Alpha and how hw went from apologetic boxing manager to drug king-pin. Anyway, the character of Stephanie was so life-like and entertaining (along with her family)that as long as she turned out o.k."
1,This isn't much of a comedy...,"Honestly, I see tons of people saying how awesome this book is and I was so disappointed with it that I actually returned it for a refund. The main character is ridiculous. She's idiotic, consistently walking into situations that any moron can see will backfire and put her in danger. If you like watching people make asses of themselves, this is the book for you. In addition, the boxer-stalker character is NOT humorous in the slightest and the voice mail rape scene was enough to make me stop reading immediately.I was looking for a fun, light read and got an annoying piece of trash."
2,Not for the delicate of mind,"I bought this novel, which my mother had read about somewhere, for her to give to a cousin. She thought she'd check out the use of ""language"" and such, before sending it off to said cousin. As a result, she promptly returned the books: too much profanity and sex. So consider this when purchasing for older people."
5,Pretty good light reading,"I picked this up on a whim after hearing great stuff about the series. I don't regret it.Great story with laugh out loud moments - her parents and dementia ridden grandmother give us some of the funniest scenes I have ever read.This isn't the most intense crime/mystery book you've ever read, but it will keep you guessing and you'll find yourself looking forward to Stephanie's latest escapade.I'll be buying the next book, definitely. I think I may be addicted."
3,Keeps you interested during the whole book,"I'm definitely reading the rest of the series!Stephanie plum is so broke that she has to start selling her own furniture in order to pay her bills, which is why she ends up landing a job as a bounty hunter. Ranger, a very funny character is the one who will teach her some basics for catching criminals. His first prey is an ex fling called Joe Morelli. Morelli is a cop who is acused of murder. Stephanie tries to cacth him and that's where the chaos begins.I loved Morelli, Ranger and Stephanie, of course. Hated the grandmother though. Too annoying.It's not as great as for me to say is one of the best books I have ever read, but it did keep me enttertained enough to go and start book number two."
1,Wait for the movie then go see something else,Poorly written and entirely predictable. I could not wait to put it down and regret ever picking it up. The book back cover reads better than the book.
3,One For The Money,"One For The Money by JE is a good book. Unfortunately my copy, given to my as a gift for my birthday last year from my brother, was destroyed after our basement flooded and it was found on the floor. The cover was torn off by the force of the water and it's now sitting outside drying on the bbq. I shall have to get another copy. I found this book to be a bit difficult to get into unlike many other mysteries I've read from Jessica Fletcher to Sue Grafton. My mom and brother thought I might like this book, but it turned out it's not quite as exciting as I thought it might be."
1,If you have nothing better to do read this book,"I got this book as a birthday present. I like reading spy novels. So, the crime novel came as something I was willing to try. Well, if you like easy read, this is a book for you. I was clearly disappointed. The main character, who normally reads only ""funnies"" form the daily paper, uses unexpectedly word such as inconspicuous, while at the same time using word curiouser?! Also, what annoyed me is that her best friend, the cop and friend married to her cousin, has ""eastern Slavic"" features, like there are ""western Slavic"" features, only we did not know about them? Anyone who likes loud mouth New Jersey girls with no style, or manners would truly enjoy this piece of trash. I cannot even imagine donating this book to anyone. It would be too embarrasing to even admit that I had it in my possesion at one time or another."
1,didn't get the books,My mother in-law has not gotten the books yet. I have read them all and they are FANTASTIC what a ride.
1,a plus,"I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these"
4,Evanovich and Plum what a pair!,"I enjoyed One for the Money very much. I thought it was a quick read! Book jumps right in, introducing you to Stephanie Plum, Rex, Morelli, Mom and Dad, Grandma Mazur and Vinnie. I think the characters are portrayed well. I think the story line just flowed from beginning to end. I'm very anxious to read the next book in the series and I'm also going to take a chance on reading the ""Full"" Series as well. I think Evanovich has struck gold with Stephanie Plum and if all the other books are as entertaining as this one is, the whole series will be well worth the read!"
3,"Mindless, but not bad...","I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting from this book. It seems like such a popular series. I won't say that I 'loved' it. I liked it. I found Stephanie to be a little annoying at times. I know she's supposed to be this bumbling crazy lady, but I dunno... It was a really easy read, read it in two nights and it's mindless reading, which was definitely welcome after the insanity of the past week or so. It's a worth a read if you need something read at the beach or on an airplane. If you want something with teeth, skip this one for now."
2,"One Too Many, Two For The Dull","The book is mediocre at best. Evanovich tries to be witty and hip, but comes out dull and awkward. The protagonist has no talent or credibility, but nevertheless manages to become a modern day street superhero in a matter of pages. Asking criminals to come with her to the police station? If that doesn't illustrate a poor, uncreative story line, maybe her ongoing brainless mistakes will.Evanovich keeps coming out with more books in this series, so my assumption is that someone out there must be reading this series. To those of you who find the first book appealing - enjoy the ride. I am ejecting at book one. One for the money, two for the dough? Spare me. One too many, two for the dull."
2,One for the Money,This book is lite and fluffy. Enjoyable but no real substance. Good beach read. Characters are interesting but not real.
2,Predictable,"The biggest problem that I have with this book is that it is predictable. Even though the writing is good and keeps me somewhat interested, I was bored because I kept guessing what was going to happen next."
3,Fair to middlin,"After hearing all the hype from my more feminine counterparts, I had to give Stephanie Plum a test drive.Frankly the first installment left me a bit wanting. I didnt think it was that clever, and I wasnt surprised by anything in it. As it happened though I had already stcked 1 through 10 in this series on my shelf so I kept them around and used them as palate cleansers when I needed a break from some of my heavier series. And I have to say they keep getting better, and by the 3rd one, I was really enjoying them. So I am glad I read them all, and in order instead of piecemeal, but think of this as more of one to get through to get the good ones."
4,"Terrific, quick read!","Hilarious! I read it in one sitting, laughing out loud many times! I saw the movie first so I could picture Jason O'Mara as Joe, which made the book even better!"
4,one for the money,"Perfect book to read during breaks at work, fun quick read. I wish there were deals where you could buy a few books at a time more cheaply"
3,Not good enough for me to continue the series,"Stephanie Plum is a loveable bounty hunter and if I had picked up this book 10 years ago, I probably would have loved it. But today the book is dated (very clearly in the 90s) and juvenile. Some of the writing is annoying - Plum narrates each street she drives down in practically every chapter, even though she stays in the same neighborhood throughout most of the book. Similarly, she describes her complete outfit on a daily basis with the only variety being the color of the over-sized t-shirt she wears over her spandex bike shorts and the shade of blue eye shadow she picks. She reminds me very much of Maddie Springer in Gemma Halliday's High Heel series, though to be fair, Plum is far less bubble-headed. This was an entertaining read, but not enough to entice me to read 18 more books in the series."
4,The Unlikely Heroine,"If you looked up the word ""desperate"" in the dictionary, you'd probably see a picture of Stephanie Plum, the unlikely heroine of this novel.After being unceremoniously laid off her job, and suffering the indignity of having her car repossessed, she can't afford to be too choosy about her career options, but ""bounty hunter"" seems to be a stretch, even for her.Worse yet, she's known her primary target since childhood, and he has the uncanny ability to mold her like silly putty at his convenience.A difficult job becomes even more so when cars start blowing up, people start disappearing, and a sadistic lunatic adds Plum to his wish list.Unlikely alliances and lucky breaks stud this quirky novel, making for a humorously unlikely crime story.Amanda Richards, February 24, 2005"
4,"Wonderful, Suspenseful, and a Great Escape from the Everyday","These books were a terrific surprise -- given to me by my Mom, I ended up reading this first one in a day, laughing out loud several times in the process.This first in the series has a little bit of everything -- an irresistible heroine, suspense, chills, genuinely interesting (and hilarous) supporting characters, and a sexy, scruffy bad guy (who's good at heart) in Joe Morelli.Stephanie Plum is an instant classic, a character so real you'll want all your friends to meet her. Want something fun and light to take on a vacation, to make you laugh, or simply to take you away for a few days? Don't miss."
3,One For The Money,An easy read. keeps you engaged. good story line and development of characters. Enjoyed. Makes you want to read the entire series.!
4,WHAT A TREAT!!,"I was turned on to this book by my doctor's receptionist; she had to tell me twice and I regret waiting that month before I read it. This was a fun, laugh-out-loud book. I loved it!"
1,Too much violence against women,"I had no idea that this book contained so many graphic depictions of violence against women -- I was truly surprised. I had to quit about half the way through. I am a fan of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries by writer Sue Grafton. I was on the wrong track thinking this would be similar! I am just not entertained by descriptions of trussed-up women and brutal, bloody sexual violence. Ugh."
4,funny and delightful read,"this is a very funny and witty mystery, with some slapstick which I have never read in a novel before! Good choice for pleasure reading."
4,Audio Book Review,Witty and gritty crime story! I listened to the audio version in my car and almost had to pull off the road a few times because I was laughing so hard! This is my first book by JE and it did not disappoint. Stephanie Plum is an entertaining character - very real with a self deprecating sense of humor. Loved the Joe Morelli character and hope to see a little more romance between the two in future books! The audio tapes are narrated by C. H. Critt (a talented female voice actor) and run about 8.5 hours.
4,My First Plum Novel,"Talk about entertainment! I literally blew through this one in a matter of hours. Stephanie Plum's wit and Janet Evanovich's engaging story telling combine for great brain candy!Our Protagonist, introduced for the first time in this novel, is an out of work discount laungerie buyer. So out of work in fact, she downs her last beer bottle for breakfast. Then she learns about the fine profession of bounty hunting from Vinnie - the bail bondsman. She also learns that if she can take down a wanted criminal (who also happens to be an ex-fling), she can earn a fast $10,000. Naturally, it doesn't come easy.What we get is a break neck paced, action packed story with some of the most tremendous wit in a novel to date, and oh yeah, its wrapped up in an excellent story line with true to life characters. Those of us who grew up in the Northeast will literally find their sides splitting with some of the humor.Great work. Can't wait to continue the series."
2,mismatch,"interpretation of the title was my mistake, this is an easy western novel, nothing to do with artillery as i had expected"
4,North Dakota-Book Review,"I bought this book as a Christmas present for someone homesick for his home state of North Dakota. I think he really enjoyed it, especially the large, beautiful nightlight(s) picture of his home town. I do wish the book were a little bigger but all-in-all, it was a great purchase."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"This could have been my fault, but I thought I was ordering a ""like new"" book. It came with chewing on the front cover and was not in the best condition. I have had to replace it to display on my coffee table. As I said, maybe I overlooked the description, but I thought I had ordered a new or like new."
4,Hopeful,"This story tells of God's perfect, redeeming power of mercy and grace. The fulfillment I felt at the novel's end gave me joy, after the main character finally found peace and contentment subsequent to the suffering from repercussions of a severe past mistake. I've recommended this book to my friends and colleagues. You should read it, too!"
3,"Covers, Not Remixes","First, the title of this collection is misleading; the tracks are covers, not remixes. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""What Is Hip? - The Remix Project"", and I was disappointed.These are basically dance-rhythm covers of popular hits; and if presented as such, I have no problem with it. (Though I have to ask, does it make sense to apply a disco thumpa-thumpa to Pat Benatar's ""We Belong""? Some songs just aren't meant to be danced to.) Some tracks turn out unrecognizable (""Down Under""), or trying and failing to reconcile the original composition with the dance format (""Total Eclipse of the Heart""). But a few, like Atomic Kitten's cover of Blondie's ""The Tide Is High"", turn out quite nicely."
4,About 10-15% improvement,"I got these for my old pickup. The 20 year old lamps were yellowed with age and didn't quite cut the mustard anymore. I like the bright blue spectrum lighting I see in my friends BMW and sought to replicate it. These lights do provide an additional 10-15% illumination but as it says on the packaging this is a WHITE light and not a blue spectrum. So in the end you get a marginally brighter halogen light. I'm happy with it as it is a huge improvement over the old lamps I was using, but not the super-beams I was hoping for."
3,Cool Blues No Longer in Production.,"Upon receipt of these headlights I found out from the Sylvania company that they are no longer in production. Units were returned and never installed, so I can't comment on their brightness, quality, or longevity."
3,Not White,Sylvania was not correct with their product. This head light DOES not emit white light like I expected. This head light is just like regular halogen head light with bigger watt. Missed information on this product. I would not buy it again because of missed information on the product.
3,headlights,"Purchased these as a christmas gift for boyfriend to replace on 1991 chevy - didn't realize he needed the ""double"" headlight - I went by the make, model, year selection and these came up - they do not fit - kinda my fault though. Can't really give a true review... :("
5,The Best!,"I am on my second winter using this glove for work. I work on jet aircraft at Portland Airport. LOTS of rain. They still keep my hands warm and bone dry. Excellent.I first tried the ""waterproof"" Seirus but they soaked through on the first day."
1,GLOVES - sizes listed are very small,"Youngstown Waterproof Winter Gloves - Unisex Sizing - Free ShippingThese gloves run a size or two smaller than listed. I ordered size extra large, a size I normally wear, and can barely get the gloves on my hands. I kept them because it is to much trouble to return them. I would not recommend them unless you have small hands and order ertra large.."
5,warm gloves,"Very satisified with gloves, well made and keeps hands warm and dry here in Northern Michigan."
2,Valogo,"I wasnt happywith my gloves , besides that they arent water proof like it saidthey was , but trying to put them on was tricky most of the time because of the inner glove would come out in the glove an the fingers wouldnt line up which became a pain . i still have them sumwhere but im looking for a new pair to buy . an not this one ."
5,This CD rocks!!!!!!!!!,"This CD rocks from start to finish! My dog Polly loves the song Alice B. Toklas! I think it's because Polly's sister's name is Alice B. Toklas! My dogs are lesbians! Anyway, enough about my dogs, back to the CD. Awesome music and lyrics! Danny Volt is a great guitarist! Biter is a great drummer! SkaTanna is an excellent bass player! You won't be disappointed with this purchase!"
3,Too big!,"I was happy to find this since it came with 3 small, 1 large. I bought them for my apartment's small stove before we moved out. The smalls fit perfectly, but the large one was too big! I thought drip pans were standard sizes. I recommend measuring first."
2,They fit.,"That is about the only good thing I can say about them. If you do not wash and dry them when done cooking, and G-d forbid they are damp or wet, they will rust in no time flat. The one on my most often used burner lasted less than 2 months as I didn't expect them to be so poorly made and didn't expect that any type of wetness would ruin them so fast.Just went to Walmart today to replace the front rusted out drip-pan. I am hoping this one will last just a wee bit longer.They do fit GE and Kenmore stoves."
5,Well priced product,Zinc lozenges are surprisingly costly at your local drug store -- generally 25 to 35 cents per lozenge. These are 1/4 that price and a relative bargain.
1,Smaller than I imagined,"I bought this pillow and from the looks of the picture I imagined that it would be much larger pillow. But when I recieved it, it was very small incline. Maybe only a couple inches. Very upset, easy return!"
1,Waste of money,"This pillow was a waste of money.I could not use it for my belly or between my legs. It's so tiny, my full length body pillow from Bed, Bath and Beyond has been much more helpful, I even bought two! I'm 9 mo. along and still have not found use for the pregnancy pillow deluxe."
1,Keep on searching,This pillow was a waste of money and did not provide the much needed support that my tummy needs at this point in pregnancy. Save your money!!
5,"Small and compact, great for travel","I really love my DEX pillow. When it first arrived I was a little worried that it would be too small. In fact, I love that it's not very bulky. It's just the right size for supporting my stomach and it packs well in a suitcase."
2,I thought it would be larger...,"Being pregnant -- I was looking for a larger, softer memory foam-type pillow. It's small, and hard, and may make a good foot rest...? but I'm not impressed."
3,"Not great, not bad","I'm in my 3rd tri and have been sleeping with a snoogle but was finding that my belly wasn't getting the support when I had my back to the snoogle --so I ordered this. But overall, it's just ok. It's very firm so not super comfortable but I still use it. But I'm not sure if I would feel like I needed it if I didn't already buy it. After seeing the Boppy wedge, I would have ordered that instead because it's much softer. The drawback to this wedge is that if you wedge too much of it under your belly, it hurts your back --defeating the whole purpose."
1,Too hard!,"I had a wedge pillow similar to this one my previous pregnancy that was perfect, but lost it along the years. I thought this was the same but it's not- I simply cannot stand using it, it's so hard it actually hurts my belly. Not worth the trouble to return it for 10 bucks; will see if anyone else can 'stomach' it."
2,Very small,"When ordering this pillow, I thought it would be one of those hospital grade wedge pillows. When it got here, and I opened it, I found a little tiny wedge pillow, not really good for anything."
1,Not a great purchase,"Not helpful once I really got big. Actually, once I got showing at all it didn't help. I am not comfortable in any position."
2,Don't let the big box fool you,"If you are expecting the answer to those sleeping problems and strains on the stomach, forget it! Whilst being tolerably comfortable and firm, it is tiny and would be more appropriate for laying one of those 'outie' belly buttons on. So when a pillow sized box comes in the mail don't get your hopes up."
1,Terrible and pointless.,"I was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly, but this was not even close to the answer to my problem. I'll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product:Terrible and pointless."
2,Doesn't feel comfortable,"I tried the wedge under my belly (24 weeks pregnant) and didn't like how it felt. The foam is too firm and doesn't mold well under my body. The fabric was soft enough, but I wish the velcro opening in the back edge was a covered zipper instead. Now, I use a regular body pillow with a cover that I got cheap ($20) at Target, and I love it! Helps me sleep so much better, and the pillow is soft enough to squish under my belly and between my legs. I didn't want to get one of those expensive pregnancy body pillows. For me, this solution has worked perfectly for side sleeping during pregnancy."
1,Not very supportive,"The truth is, you can't cheap out on comfort. I bought this for my 5 mo. pregnant wife who was starting to have trouble sleeping. This pillow is flimsy and did not provide much support because of the awkward angle you have to put it at to use it. Also, if you do buy it, wash the cover first - it smelled like melted plastic right out of the box."
3,so small!,"Not bad for $10 but VERY small & somewhat firm. I thought I could prop my head up in bed but it is really only good for between my knees. Too firm for under my belly, but may work for you."
5,Firm comfort,I've been using this for 2 weeks now and have no complaints. I'm 31 weeks pregnant and use this pillow to prop my self up while lying on my side and reading in bed. Also I use it wedged a little at my back when I sleep on my side to remind me in the middle of the night not to roll onto my back.
2,Not impressed..quite uncomfortable.,"I bought this wedge as my stomach started getting bigger to find some comfort sleeping at night. The wedge is very stiff, even after working it for a little while. The angle of it isn't right..it should be thicker at it's current thinnest part, because basically, my belly just pushes into it, and it falls on the floor, eventually. It was a waste of money, and a rolled up blanket or pillow does the job way better, and they are way more comfortable!"
2,Too firm!!!,I purchased this product because I'm 5 months with my 2nd baby. I wanted a firm pillow but this was way too firm! It made my ribs hurt. I exchanged it for the boppy pregnancy wedge. It was only $3 more and it works great!!!
1,Boppy wedge was much better,"For my first pregnancy I had the wedge made by ""Boppy"". It was a real life saver, and was so useful for before my daughter could sit up alone. I gave it away to a friend, and was forced to purchase a new belly wedge. I bought this one. I hate it. the material is ver rough, it doesn't follow the contour of my belly, nor does it stay in place. Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,very small,"It is very small, I thought it would be larger. If I use it behind my back it digs into my lungs. Spend more money and get a larger one."
3,"good support, too harsh","I bought it in my 21 week. I have a L shape nursery pillow, but need another to support my belly. It is a good value. And it does do the support job. The problem is it is too hard for me. I have put it away and expect to use it when my belly gets bigger ..."
1,Do not buy this product,I bought this pillow to support my belly in my third trimester because not supporting it was causing my back to ache during the day and night. I used it the first night and it made my back ache worse. It is hard and does not support at all. The small size does little to help either. I would suggest a foam pillow which contours to your belly.
4,Good product-but give yourself a few days to adjust to it,"I got this because I was looking for an alternative to sleeping with 4-5 pillows. Since I felt the Snugli body pillow was way to big I gave the Dex a shot after reading the reviews. The first two nights I wasn't very impressed and almost gave up on it. Two things really helped me in utilizing it. First, I think it needs a few days to be broken in. To do this I used it when on the couch when reading or watching TV as well as when sleeping. Second, I also think it helps to lean on it more than lie on top of it. There are no specific instruction on the box, but for me it was uncomfortable if my side was actually on the pillow. If I lean on it I am not using much of the pillow surface, but the support is helpful. As far as using it between your legs, I found this very uncomfortable. For me, a regular pillow works much better."
5,I would pay a million dollars for this product!!!!!,"First Time Pregnant and not sleeping a wink, my mother purchased for me a standard body pillow. My husband, who had been sleeping just fine, now was not sleeping a wink. We decided this was because of the pillow the size of an extra person in bed with us. So for Christmas my husband got smart and purchased the Pregnancy Pillow Deluxe. Who knew that something so moderately priced and so ""small"" would provide the wonderful full night's sleep that I had been wanting these long 6 1/2 months. My husband also slept much better. Thank you Dex Baby Products!!!"
3,It is ok for the money,"I am in my third trimester, but I bought this pillow in the second trimester, and it has already flattened a bit. I still use it however, as it still provides some much needed support for my poor flopped over belly! I would definitely reccomend getting two (since the price is right) so you can really wedge yourself up or sit on during the day (boy that feels good too if your sciatic nerve is hurting your hip or back during pregnancy.)"
3,"helpful, but a little small",I found the pillow somewhat helpful. The only complaint was that it's a little smaller than I would have liked.
3,Good while it lasted,This pillow does it's job until your belly gets big and heavy. Then it just squashes flat. Great concept but it needs to be manufactured out of better materials. At the low price I would recommend buying 2.
2,Not a Wedge to Put under a pillow,"This wedge is very small, it will work well for supporting a pregnant belly but is not for sleeping on. I was disappointed that it was so small and firm."
4,It's okay,"It is a small pillow, most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation. It's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it, maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it'd be okay. I don't think I'd call this a ""pregnancy pillow"" - it's too small. My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back (and only 4"" tall) isn't going to help. However this worked good for just head elevation (with another pillow on top)."
1,Extremely firm,This item is extremely firm almost cardboard-like. I won't be using this item in my last 2 trimesters of pregnancy.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this because it was so much cheaper than a Snoogle, and I needed some support for my growing belly. It worked okay during my second trimester. Now that I'm in the third, I feel that it is much too firm. I have to adjust and readjust several times during the night. It's better than nothing, I suppose."
1,Ouch. This pillow is HARD.,"Don't waste your money. This pillow is hard and doesn't do the job right. Constantly I was finding myself re-adjusting to try and get comfortable with it the few nights I tried to use it. If you were going to think you're saving money by using something like this, you'll find that a folded towel or even old feather pillow works wayyyyyy better."
5,A Must-Have!!,"Having back problems to begin with, my ever-growing belly was making my back ache, especially at night. You're not supposed to sleep on your back, sleeping on your tummy is out of the question. So, you turn to your side & your belly just hangs there. Here is your solution! I slept so much better, my back ached less & less, this is a simple & yet amazing product! Defenitely a must-have for all pregnant women! I also recommend a pillow in between your knees...helps relieve back pain too!"
1,Not worth it,"The picture made this look bigger than it was. It is small and does little to assist in making you comfortable. If I could find the receipt, I would send it back. The pregnancy pillows are much better and can be used for so much more."
3,Not entirely pleased with pregancy wedge...,"I am not completely satisfied with the wedge, but I think it is mainly due to the fact that I am a large person, and it isn't quite big enough for me, personally. If you are a small person, it would probably work great. I use it behind my back mainly...it doesn't seem to work great when I use it under my belly."
4,Comfort for an Inexpensive Price,"I really like my pregnancy pillow. It has given me the ""edge"" to be able to sleep better at night. It nicely fits the gap between your bed and tummy, which stabilizes your body and levels your frame. It is also small so that you can flip over and switch the pillow easily.One suggestioon to new buyers- just fit the pillow into the gap between tummy and sleep surface naturally. At first, I tried to stuff as much of the pillow between the gap. This was not very comfortable. Depending on where you are in your pregnancy, you will use more or less of the pillow wedge. Definitely a winning item for the very inexpensive price. :-)"
2,Rush to publish!,"Although the book is readable and avoids the geekspeak often found in programming books, there are too many glaring errors in this first edition. If you precisely follow the instructions, even the universal ""Hello World"" program does not work. True , you only have to change a tab index number to zero but nothing of this is mentioned and an ""absolute beginner"" will find this frustrating. There are multiple other errors and omissions that lead one to believe that there was a rush to get this book out there first. I would suggest waiting for the second edition or purchasing a book that has been proofread more closely."
1,Avoid this book beginner,"As an experienced C programmer, I was very disappointed in the lack of attention to detail that the programming examples display. The amount of errors are abundant (out of bounds indexes, case sensitivity, spelling, etc) and MANY of the examples will not compile as written in the book. This book was used in an introductory C# class and I've spent more time debugging the books errors then I could have produced as a complete programming novice. I would pursue an alternative guide to programming in C# if your thinking of purchasing this book, it was definitely rushed for publication with little to no proofreading or editing in my opinion. Details matter in an absolute beginner book."
1,Are they serious!!!,"Someone please take this book off the shelves. I have never seen a published book with soo many mistakes. It's almost every other page there is some programming error that could cause a beginner (such as myself) to want to throw their computer out the window, until you snap to your senses and realize it's the book.Look on the bright side at least it makes a good paper weight, booster seat, and you can use the paper for paper airplanes and fires, but it doesn't make a good programming book for beginners."
1,Ridiculous,This book is ridiculous for a beginner. There are so many errors the poor beginner will be scratching their head more than learning.
4,Book for Europe Spain,"This excellent book of Spanish history tells you every thing about Spain in that time. But not just of Spain, also tells you everything about European situation in that time. Only annotation to this book is that the history of New World is just mentioned. The maps are very useful and help you a lot. The index helps you to find information very quickly, although you read the book several months before. So book is very good, and very, very useful."
3,"Good, but even recording quality","Steck and Rieger are former Musica Antiqua Köln members. I enjoyed the recording... one sonata has been recorded by others as a Bach work.Steck does a reasonable job; I disagree with the other comment - this music is hard! Especially so the solo material.I found an uneven recorded quality between tracks. For those with lesser sound quality, those tracks suffer. Compare the first track with the next sonata... hear the difference?"
4,Mostly accurate but a bit tedious to use,"Unfortunately it's the only way to present as detailed a map in this way, but book-form street guides are just plain horrible any way you dice them. You go off one map and have to start flipping to the next page halfway through the book, then back to make sure you're lining up... heaven forbid you are looking for something that straddles two pages! In this particular issue I noticed there were some page numbering problem with roads that are on the borders of any given page, but this was infrequent and easy to figure out."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option! This pump is VERY painful (damaging in fact), has inconsistent suction, does not promote ""let down"", and is noisy. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone! I purchased this pump before returning to work after the birth of my child. If this was the only product available to me, I would have stopped pumping after a week. I would recommend this product be permanently removed from store shelves!Consider purchasing a Medela Pump In Style instead. The Medela pump is well worth the investment."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this pump hoping that I would be able to double pump during my lunch break at work. After only two weeks of pumping twice during an eight hour period, the pump quit on me. I called the company & they sent me an entire new pump. About four weeks later, I was only able to single pump & had to call the company again. They sent me just an arm replacement. It has been another four weeks & I have to call the company again for another arm replacement.Even though I have had problems with this pump, the company has been helpful enough in sending me replacement parts. But I wish I had not purchased this product."
1,Don't bother with this one!,"I purchased this pump because it was the cheapest dual, electric pump I could find. Within 3 days, one of the arms was broken and the motorized pump wouldn't give enough suction to even use it on one side. The customer service people were very nice and sent a new one within 3 business days. However, after 2 months of fairly successful pumping (albeit, sometimes uncomfortable), I couldn't get my milk to let-down with this pump. After weeks of trying and only getting 1-2 ounces at each attempt, I broke down and got a hospital grade Ameda pump. The difference is amazing! Only 30 seconds on the new pump and my milk was flowing easily. The new pump is less portable but SO much more comfortable and efficient I'll never go back."
1,Buyer beware!!!!,"Don't buy this product!!! It is extremely painful to use this pump on a regular basis and can harm your breasts, trust me spend the extra money for a good pump!!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"Follow everyone's advice and do not waste your money on this!!! It hurt me like crazy and I was lucky to get 1 ounce out in 15 minutes from both breasts. I would recommend the Isis, it's far better than trying to get this thing to work."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This was my first experiance with an electric pump, and was awful! The motor was very weak and it did not provide the proper suction. I called the company and told them of my complaints, they sent me a new motor and new washer rings (the rings in case the suction was being broken) however neither helped. This pump was loud, and painful and did not allow me to pump enough milk. The suction release is manualy operated but the motor could not keep up with the number up times I would need to relase per minute to simulate my baby's sucking, witch made let down even harder! I do not suggest to anyone to buy this product."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"I purchased this pump hoping for a fast and convenient way to pump while working. After I used this product about ten times, the motor for the sucking action went out. When the pump did work, I was lucky to get an ounce, which took over thirty minutes of pumping.I would not recommend this pump to anyoneA true waste of time and money."
2,I do not reccomend this pump at all...,"I thought that with it being a dual pump it would be faster....wrong. I only found it to be weak, painful and a little on the loud side. I ended up springing the money for a Medula and what a difference. Please rent a pump before you buy one so you can feel what a difference a hospital grade pump makes. If you are looking to pump only one bottle a week, then choose a manual hand pump (it's cheaper and doesn't hurt your tender breast)."
2,not happy with,"Aside from the noise it makes(like a cow) the pump is malfunctioming after 4 weeks of use. The on off button doesnt always work and it is losing suction and power. And since I can't find a 1 800 number for the manufacture, cant return it to the store of purchase( ""sanitary reasons"" ),and if i return it to the manufacture i have to get a replacement while this one is out of service, we have no choice but to mess with it ourselves. As a first time mom i prefer to give birth again than to try and use this pump at work , my only private place since the machine is so loud will be out in the car and hope that noone walks by. They need to have better customer support from this manufacture."
2,Not too great,I never could get both breasts situated for double pumping. Doing it single was ok but not good. I got better results with the manual pump they gave me for free in the hospital. It seemed better at causing let down which is crucial to a productive pumping experience. I would not recommend this pump at all.
1,waste of money,"my grandmother bought this pump for me and not wanting to hurt her feeling i made up different reasons not to use it. its very loud, it pulls too much on the nipple, and u cant get the suction right, either its too much suction or not enuff. also i never could get the dual part goin on. the bottles moved around too much i could only get one seal at a time...it usually took about 1 hr to get 6 oz.now i'm about to spend tha money on a pump in style because it is 1 of 2 pumps rated for full time pumping. ..."
1,Disapointed Mom,"I purchased the Dual Breast Pump Kit by The First Years when I first had my baby. I didn't use it often & it worked ok cause I had the time. When I went back to work I took me over 30 minutes to pump 6 oz. and the motor started rattling louder. I got it out quicker by hand! With the design it sucks milk into the motor & causes it to go bad. My employeer was upset with the time I took & I was afraid I would be forced to supplement. Then I decided to go for a better product. I got the Pump-N-Style by Medela & LOVE IT! It gets 8 oz. in 10 minutes! I wrote First Years and told them how their product was faulty & they returned my money. I will by First Years again, just not their pumps. In the long run, [price] for a pump is not that bad to get a good one unless you have a lot of time on your hands."
2,Double isn't always better...,"I've been using this pump for 6 weeks now and pretty much since day one, I've not been able to utilize the dual pump feature. If you have large breasts, it's VERY awkward regardless of the fact that it can move in many directions. The suction power was very good (at first) but I've noticed that it is losing that gradually! Not only is it losing the suction, one side has worse suction than the other. I'm still able to get milk out but I do wonder for how much longer. I really recommend going with a single pump if your breasts are cup D or larger. To be all fair, the bottles are great, the bag is somewhat cheesy, it does come with two different nipple adapters, and one cold pack."
1,not very durable,"I loved it at first. It worked great. But after 3 1/2 months it just stopped working. It would be on but with no suction. I don't know why it just stopped working, I need to see if its still under warrenty. Maybe its just a fluke. Luckily a friend of mine gave me her Medela ""Pump in Style"". If you can afford the expensive Medela get it rather than take a chance."
1,suction stuck,"I wouldn't advise anyone to get this pump due to my experience with it. I tried using it twice, for one I dont like the suction it was a constant pull on my nipples. The second time I gave it a try it had pulled my nipples all the way through the chamber till my nipples were sticking out of the other end. It wounld not release me even when I turned it off. The baby was crying and I was crying running around the house looking for something to get these cups off my breast. I finally had to get some cooking oil and a sink of warm water. After that you can say i was swollen and sore. I wasted no time getting rid of that suction trap. PLEASE not go through what I did by getting this pump. You do better with hand expresstion, trust me I am."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"If only I had read these reviews before spending money on this breast pump! I would give it 0 stars instead of 1 star if it was possible. The motor is loud and the breast pump feels more like a torture device. My nipples have never been so sore! I bought this for use with my first baby and had no idea what breast pumps were supposed to feel like. After the pain that this machine caused me, I went and bought a [inexpensive] manual pump because I knew it wouldn't suck my nipples through the bottle! Don't waste your money like I did! I should have done a lot more research before buying this horrible pump."
4,I Loved this Pump,"Well, although most of the other reviews on this product are pretty bad, surprisingly, I loved this pump. The price was excellent. Under $60. It provided dual pumping and wasn't too noisy for me. It did have a ""humming"" sound and is not as quiet as it's more expensive counterparts, but when I returned to work and went into the bathroom to pump, I had no problem letting my co-workers know what the humming sound was that they were going to be hearing. I returned to work 4 weeks after my baby was born, worked 3 twelve hours shifts a week, and nursed until she was 10 1/2 months old. The pump lasted the entire time. Now, it did start to have some problems near the end. I had to hold it just right in order for it to work, but it still worked. For less than $60, it was an excellent pump, and I'm planning on buying another one for my next baby who is due in August. (Unless I can find a used Medela on-line for a decent price...smile.)"
1,Disappointing...,"I purcjased this dictionary for my daughter last year when she was in first grade. It does not have basic words such as ""Christmas"", ""decorate"", ""build"". We are ordering a different children's dictionary tonight, and hope to have better luck! The photos are nice, but there are too few words and watered down definitions..."
2,Left a lot to be desired...,"I purchased this dictionary for my daughter when she was in 2nd grade. There were a lot of words that were not in her dictionary that were a part of the 2nd grade curriculum for our county here in Florida. She would ask me what a word means and I would tell her, ""I just bought you a dictionary, so go and look it up."" Well, she did and more times than not, the words were not there. So I ended up going to a local used book store to purchase her a dictionary. This was a disappointing purchase because she excitedly picked it out online and it did not serve her purpose."
1,Author is definately Anti-Christmas!!!,"I couldn't believe I saw this as the definition, and of course I was reading it aloud to my child.Look up the word ""SPACE"" in the dictionary! There are so many ways you can define ""space"". The author, Judith Levey, gives this definition: (A space is any area that is not filled with something. Mom hid the Christmas presents in a space at the back of her closet).Unbelievable. Yes...its 3 days before Christmas, and I do have presents hidden in my closet. Way to kill the spirit!"
1,Where is the zero star option,"I am using this book as part of course curriculum and I am sad to say that this has to be without a doubt the worst computer book I have ever read. Reading this book makes my eyes want to bleed it is so bad.It glosses over topics such as arrays, classes & class interaction and only briefly mentions recursion. Add to that the fact it does NOT even cover multi-dimensional arrays or any type of dynamic data handling. How do I store data if I don't want to cap how much data can be entered?Not only is the information lacking it is poorly structured. It ""covers"" classes before it goes into selection ,repetition and arrays. This seems a little backwards to me.Avoid at all costs."
2,So Hard To Find A Thoroughly Good Programming Book,"I am using this book for my online course, and while this book started out wonderfully, good explanations, definitions, etc. ,I am now on Chapter 8, and the more 'abstract' side of programming is very vaguely defined.I started off thinking this was a great book, and now I do not."
5,One of the Textbooks worth keeping,"I fully concur with the last reviewer. I think Joyce Farrell has done an excellent job with this book. The simple no-nonsense approach she takes in writing material that is geared for the beginning programmer. In the past, I had a hard time understanding Object Oriented Programming until I read this book. Now, I feel that I have a solid background in OOP. I also purchased this book to help my transitioning from Visual Basic to C# and I have to say, it has helped me tremendously. I would love to see her write a book on developing Windows and Web applications using C#. Keep up the great work Joyce!"
2,Strong beginning - after that just annoying,"The book started out promising enough, but then it became more and more annoying. Especially the second part. It became boring too.I agree with one of the earlier reviews. She is just killing off too many people in that book. It becomes really annoying, almost ridiculous. In the end everybody is dead and all we read is how sad the main caracter is over and over. She is pretty much crying for half of the book anyway. Again: Annoying. For the last couple of chapters I wasn't interest enough anymore and just flew over the pages to get to the end. And that was annoying too.There are far, far better historical novels out there."
3,Not What Its Cracked Up to Be,"First off, the historical aspects of this book are perfect. Barbara's Grandmother is a wonderful gem. Would have enjoyed reading her story rather than her granddaughter's. The depiction of stock market manipulation, cleaning recipes and the plague are perfect and accurate.The rest of it was boring and dragged. When the novel was done I chucked it. If you must read this, get it from the library don't waste your money."
2,Glorified romance novel,"As far as romance fiction goes, 'Through a Glass Darkly' should get five stars out of five. The wealth of heart-warming cliches and mind-numbing descriptive minutiae (replete with navel-gazing, philosophical extractions from the Bible and various English poets of the period) will satisfy the pickiest reader in that genre.If, however, you're looking for well-written historical fiction, this novel shouldn't get more than two stars, one for being fairly accurate in its description of the period, and the other one for ambition (that and the effort it took to type the manuscript.)"
4,Interesting book,"I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. I liked this book but it was sooooooo depressing. I felt very depressed after I put it down :). I wish there was at least one character in this book that wasn't unhappy, lol. Barbara and Roger's story was so heartbreaking. I'm not sure if I'm going to read the sequel or the prequel."
3,If you like the Thorn Birds and GWTW...,"You'll love this one. Personally, when I read fiction, I like a bit more escapism in my reading. Real life is depressing enough. The book is well-written and historically accurate but it reminded me a bit too much of The Thorn Birds. Heart-wrenching, shocking and although I couldn't put it down (kind of like seeing a bad car accident and not being able to look away), I was more than happy when it was finished. Not the happiest kind of book to read in these trying times."
3,"Good, but a little raunchy for my taste","I'm only about 3/4 of the way through this book, and I have enjoyed it so far. The only thing I'm taken aback by is some of the explicit/perverse sex scenes. I don't believe I'm a prudish person, but there are just some things I don't want to know the details of. Especially when I'm reading a historical novel. I wish, however, that I hadn't read the reviews before I finished it since it supposedly leaves you hanging on a lot of the characters. I may post again after I finish."
5,I read this again and again,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I never read romance novels, and would not consider this one a romance at all. There is a lot of talk of love and happiness but very little romance in the traditional romance novel term. It is very historical, painting a rich portrait of society on several different levels, the country which the heroine travels, and the limited resources a young woman, even one of a higher economic class, had in those times. You feel close to the main character and can even imagine that you are there, sometimes forgetting you are even reading a novel. It is very real and though it is set in another time, the heroine is very reachable, very knowable. Her feelings are your feelings as you move with her through the years of her life.One of the best books I have ever read. Lengthy but hard to put down."
4,A 'Must' for historical romance fans,I found it hard to put this book down one I got into it. You feel the characters grow and lose yourself in the story. I cannot wait to start on the sequel and see how it concludes.
5,Karleen Koen knows how to capture pure emotion!,Through a Glass Darkly remains one of my all-time favorite books. I read it in a week when I sprained my ankle and I found myself bawling my eyes out in the middle! It is very easy to become attached to the characters and Karleen Koen is an expert at making the reader feel the emotions of the characters.I have also read Now Face to Face. I could hardly wait for it to come out. I hope that Karleen Koen continues to write historical fiction because I would snatch it up in a heartbeat!You must read this book!
5,A must read!!,"I am known for only reading very high-end quality romances--and this is about my favorite. Ms. Kohen's descriptions are so vivid, you can practically see the characters and what they are wearing. She really makes you care about them, and it's not just alot of sex, like in alot of romances, the relationship really develops.This is a must read for anyone who loves the victorian era."
2,Its full of sex and should be rated R,"This book comes with A LOT of good reviews. And I cannot deny that it is well written. The story follows a teenage girl whom I felt protective of and her mother whom I quickly felt sorry for. But the author put in more sex than was necessary. Simple allusions to it would have sufficed.The book reads slowly. It felt like it took along time to get to the first main event in the story. As to its historic nature, the author has pinned many details perfectly and she fills the story with facts and details that brings the story to life."
3,Surprised by the preponderance of 5-star reviews,"I had high expectations for this book, but I can't say that they were met. Despite turns of plot that promised character development, I found that most characters, including the protagonist, remained fairly one-dimensional. Peculiarly, some scenes that Koen could have used to show character growth were left to occur in a time-lapse vacuum; in one case, instead of seeing Barbara sort through the challenge of a particular plot twist, the reader is swept directly to a scene several years later, none the wiser. The plot itself held no surprises for me; Koen's foreshadowing came across as clunky and heavy-handed. This book suffers from a serious case of Chekhov's gun. Despite my litany of complaints, it's a fine, inoffensive read, but I never was drawn in to Barbara's world, nor did I become invested in her story. There is much better historical fiction out there."
5,Great balance of history and fiction!,"I have read both this book and its sequel both twice thru, it's that great. The author's ability to blend historical fact into such an interesting plot line is amazing. Most books I read that try to involve historical politics tempt me to skip ahead due to boredom, but not this book! The characters' individuality makes for realistic interaction and conflict. I couldn't help but read this book in no more than five or six sittings. It really is quite a sizeable book, but if it's the type of reading that catches your attention, pick it up, set yourself down, and prepare for one of the most realistic, captivating, enjoyable treks into the fictitious past."
5,One of the best books!!!,"This is very well written, I cried almost throughout the whole book. I have read many historical romance novels and this one seem to have it all. Romance, betrayal, love and more!I could not put this book down. Story line and characters are very good the only thing that I did not particularly like is the side stories of dreams or flashbacks that don't really pertain to the story or if they did they went to deep and off subject."
5,Excellent Book,"I don't review things often, but I couldn't help it with this book. It is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are fantastic and I find the story emotionally compelling. The economic turmoil of the South Sea scandal is quite relevant to our own recent economic slump.In spite of the book's length, it was over too quickly! (Just realized there is a sequel!)"
2,Annoying,"This book was nothing more than annoying. The author's writing style was not bad, which is the only thing that allowed me to be able to finish the book. The majority of the characters are unlikable, the heroine in particular. She was nothing more than a whiny little crybaby. I won't be able to force myself to read the sequel. This book's style came across as more of a romance than an historical fiction novel. There is no possible way this book could ever compare to Gone with the Wind."
2,Over done and drawn out - disappointed,"I love to read, but the author has over done it. It's too long and drawn out. There are too many things going on. The majority of the book, I skimmed over and just flipped pages. I was not impressed. I only read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened to Barbra and Roger. There is way to much going on and a lot of useless information given. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I feel that the author should have focused on the 2 main characters and their story, but the author just goes into so much non-sense in the book and just draws it out. How this book is a ""New York Times Best Seller"" is beyond me. It's not that great. Choose for yourself how you feel. I chose this book because it had good reviews from people, but I don't think those were honest reviews."
2,"Never ever pulled me in, but I kept thinking maybe it would...","The way this story is written is odd. I never felt a flash of anxiety, happiness, excitement, etc. It was just flat. The plot is what kept me reading because a great potential always seemed to be hovering around the next corner. The fights, the sex, the turmoil, and the sorrow were beyond confusing me with the authors inability to maker me FEEL any of these things. The book is in two parts and I found the transition any thing but seamless and compelling. Let me get to the point...I won't even be giving this author a second chance, it was that big of a let down. Two stars for the over all vision and idea of the plot."
5,Through a Glass Darkly,I loved this book. It was enjoyable and interesting and I laughed and cried but mostly i just couldnt put it down.
5,A vacation ruined!,"We just got back from a cruise down the Danube from Prague to Budapest where our traveling buddy was reading this book, Through the Glass Darkly. She kept slipping away in the evening to go read and I finally asked her what she was reading and immediately downloaded it.For the rest of the trip amidst all the beautiful scenery and rich history, all I wanted to do was slip away and read it as well!Kathleen's research, her story line, and the creative way she forms her sentences holds my attention as it has not been held by any other book since ""Unbroken!"" I have already downloaded the rest of her books and can't wait to ""gobble them up"" like I did this one. What a talent!"
2,Killing,"I love historical novels. This one is not badly written, but, the author does not seem to know what to do with the people in her novel and she keeps killing then. After 400 pages I learned not to get attached to anyone the beautiful Barbara loves, for surely he will die shortly. Can you believe the authoe killed the 5 beloved young brothers and sisters of the heroin in one page?, I was horrified, (the remaining older brother had to kill himself for lack of plague). It was no surprise that a cute 4 years old godson had no chance of surviving the flue and a mirracle that his brothers were still breathing at the end of the novel. I do not dare order the sequel for I am sure that if barbara will ever have children, they will not live very long. I dare Mz. Koen to try and actualy develope relationships in her novels that will last a few years."
2,Couldn't hold my interest,"With about 100 pages to go, I just realized that I didn't give a darn about any of the characters or what happens to them. I just put the book down. I felt like it was mostly a waist of time. The characters are so UNLIKABLE!!! There is not one character in the book that had any redeeming qualities, they were all selfish and dull."
2,Overrated,"Koen did her research, and that's to her credit. But the plot was sluggish, the characters flat and I simply could not force myself to care. It was only by sheer force of will that I finished it at all. If you're really looking for a ""fluffy"" novel with plenty of melodrama, you might like this book. I, however, was searching for something with more meat to it..."
2,Not for fans of historical fiction,"I had seen this book on a list of recommended reading under the category, British historical fiction. The history is a backdrop; that is, the setting is the early 18th Century. But don't expect to learn much about the times.The author spends the first 200 pages on a marriage contract that ultimately fails. Why she takes 200 pages to get to the point is beyond me.I did get a good sense of the characters. So if you like character development and stories about family relationships, you might like it. What I read of the book resembled WIDEACRE by Philippa Gregory. But if you are looking for historical fiction, look elsewhere."
3,Good read,"I loved the descriptions of life in England. I did find a few errors. On page 275 the word ""hid"" should be ""had"". On page 332 there should not be a period after the word ""him"". On page 507 the word ""be"" should be ""he"" in the sentence ""If be kisses me, she thought...and she could not finish the thought."""
5,Truly a deep and meaningful book!!!,"This is on my list of favorite books ever. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The writing is superb. The plot is interesting and well paced. The characters are unforgettable. I have read this book 5 times and I will read it more. There is always something new in it, something that hits me as relevant to my life, every time I read it. It is much more thought provoking than a romance, but it is romantic. It is more story- and character-driven than most historical fiction, but the author brings you into the world of the past and makes you feel you've experienced it for yourself. Buy it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
3,Petula in French,"I was disappointed as I was expecting the song, Downtown, to be sung in French, not in English. This CD was described as music in French."
5,One of Ray's BEST!,"Absolutely fantastic! Soul wrenching sounds that brought me to tears just to hear such gutteral feelings expressed in his voice. I always loved the country sounds by Ray and have owned the original lp since it first came out many years ago. Was searching for cd of it when I ran across this set. Had never heard many of the songs before, but after listening to the samples, I knew I had to own it. If you love country and Ray, you will not be disappointed in this set. Since purchasing it, I have spent many hours listening to the songs and reminissing about the old times they bring back to mind. A little expensive, but well worth the price to me. Definitely one of the best purchases I have ever made on here."
5,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!!!,"Ray Charles shows his rare genius from start to finish. It is a refreshing box set of soulful music, as Ray takes classic country songs mixed in with some of his very own to a whole new level. Do not hesitate to buy because it is only country, for this collection of songs will be enjoyable to any music lover and especially that of Ray. No specific genre is necessary here, for it is just beautiful music. Words cannot describe how quickly this set touches the soul, as Ray sings from his. This purchase is worth every penny. Add to your cart now! You will not regret it."
4,Enlightening viewpoints,"Chomsky addresses the questions that very few others seem daring enough to deal with in the subject of 9-11 and terrorism. This is a piece that attacks unilateralism on every page and for every issue. Is there more than one way at looking at the events of 9-11? Is there more than one way of dealing with the aftermath? The answer is a resounding yes, and it doesn't mean that Chomsky hates Americans or likes terrorists; on the contrary, he wants - as much as or more than anyone - peace and justice. Justice, however, comes in many shapes and needs to be used on all guilty parties.The lack of a 5th star is due mainly to the format and vagueness on certain issues. The interview format makes for an easy, informal read, but it does not facilitate the depth and detail that you would find in a full-scale book."
3,A quick overview of Chomsky's earliest reactions to 9/11,"This slim Chomsky book has a lot of important information in it --- unless you've read Chomsky before. If you know anything about US foreign policy, this is a recap. If you've never read Chomsky before, this is an okay place to start. (A better place to start is Chronicles of Dissent.)What does it have to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks? Well, Chomsky gives you a lot of context. He shows you that these events didn't take place in a historical vacuum. But once you've read that, it's up to you to learn more, by reading dozens of other books."
1,noam chomsky hates America,"This book reek's. Right off the bat when the author is asked, did the attacks of 9-11 change the geopolitical scene? he just cant help his anti-american views, he spouts off how the U.S. annihilated million's of people, conquered half of mexico, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines killing hundreds of thousands of filipinos. He calls the U.S. a leading terrorist state. He goes on to call osama bin laden a {courageous fighter}If you love America skip this book!"
1,hateful garbage,"This is a spiteful, hateful man who is out of his element outside of linguistics. And he got that wrong, as well."
5,"Concise and correct, as always","The man is always spot-on. I've found this book to be an excellent primer for initiates to American imperial politics. Short, direct and easy to read... they always come back wanting more. A fine purchase for the first-time Noam reader."
3,Spot on but outdated,"Chomsky's analysis of the political situation is, as always, extraordinarily astute. He has a knack for cutting to the quick, summing up extremely complex international political situations succinctly and comprehensibly. And he certainly doesn't beat around the bush!But five years down the line, though most of his predictions have sadly proved true, this book is clearly outdated. Owing to its structure, moreover - a series of interviews with journalists asking more or less the same questions - it's rather repetitive.Now I'd like to know his thoughts on the situation in Iraq - and Somalia...."
4,Informative,"This is excellent material from Chomsky. Inspired me to reread some of his earlier works and to purchase 2 I hadn't read. This is clear, concise, if somewhat repetitive(but it tells you it will be, so that's all right too). Gives a different view of the cause and effects of 9/11, a must read for anyone wanting a well rounded view of that time."
1,Worthless,"All of Chomsky's work is worthless...Not because of a lack of thought but because of too much thought.He offers a single-minded attack with no realistic alternatives.When reading anything Chomsky writes, ask yourself what is the alternative - it is easy to attack any course of action (and the past behavior of any nation). The unfortunate truth is that even the best possible course of action may be successfully attacked:Until Chomsky begins to offer a realistic alternative along with his criticisms, his entire body of work will remain worthless."
1,Chomsky the chump,"Chomsky once wrote that the spelling system of the Englishlanguage was ""almost perfect."" This from an ""expert"" on linguistics. You can imagine how shallow Chomsky becomeswhen he branches into areas like politics and others foreignto his area of competence, such as it is. I'm amazed anyonewould attempt to understand the events of 9/11 by reading thistransparently simple minded account. Chomsky hasn't a clue when it comes to the motives of the terrorists, which somehow get completely lost in his convoluted and confused accounting.But this book is all about getting to press early on to benefitfrom the notoriety. In other words, it's about greed, not tragedy."
1,ANTI-AMERICAN ...,"In this book, rushed out after 9-11, Chomsky starts the process of blaming America for al-Qaeda's terrorism. This is not the work of an investigator analyzing facts, but rather a propagandist making a case and making up ""facts"" to fit."
1,Too bad you can't negative stars,Let me see if I understand: The attacks of September 11 are justified because the CIA supported regimes that killed people half a century ago.I wish that Chomsky would join all the other far left idiots who are migrating to Canada because they can't stand to live in a country where the majority of voters have some semblance of morality
2,disappointed,Very disappointed with the book that I didn't even finish reading it. The book is more or less an interview with Chomsky. It really didn't offer any insight to 911 and it didn't offer anything new. I expected more out of this book and from Chomsky.
4,"on Chomsky's ""9-11""","Much of the material on ""9-11"" from the talks Chomsky gave shortly after and made it into this book can easily be found on the internet for free. The material in the book is decent and I understand that 7 Stories Press wanted to get out a book on this most important event in a hurry... But for those really interested in reading Chomsky's core political critique and philosophy I'd recommend turning to the new ""Understanding Power"" or ""Profit Over People"" which are more representative examples of his work."
5,Fantastic Little Book !!!,"I am a big fan of Noam Chomsky, and if you like to read a short book about 9/11 and the lies and deceptions attached to this tragic event, I highly recommend this book."
4,"Intresting, but repetive","This sudo-book (closer to a phamphlet) is very important in a world where it is taboo to question the US government without shouts of ""terrorist"" comming up. It is rather repetive, but this can be attributed to the fact that these are interviews assembled by a third party, not a book/essay by Chomskey himself. None the less, it does detract from the reading. In short, an interesting set of oppinions with solid factial backing."
2,Decepcionante...,"La verdad me gustaría escribir buenos comentarios sobre este libro... Pero en realidad no es lo que esperaba. Cuando vi el título del libro, esperaba encontrar un relato detallado de los hechos que se desarrollaron durante los ataques del 11 de Septiembre, el secuestro de los aviones, la lucha heroica de los pasajeros del vuelo 93, etc..., pero en su lugar me encontré con una serie de afirmaciones y opiniones (por supuesto muy respetables) del autor sobre política internacional de los Estados Unidos para esa época. Es posible que al libro le hayan puesto el título equivocado; de hecho debería haberse llamado ""Disertaciones sobre política internacional de los Estados Unidos en 2001"", porque realmente es muy poco (o nada) lo que se lee sobre los hechos que ocurrieron el 11 de septiembre, que es lo que uno esperaría leer en un libro con este título."
2,Un Comentario,"Mala traducción al español y además el formato electrónico en el Kindle es deficiente lo que no lo hace fácil de leer. Chomsky, buen pensador y crítico de lo que sucede considera que los hechos del 11 de septiembre tuvieron su origen en todas las actitudes terroristas y desnaturalizadas de la política norteamericana en muchos de los conflictos en los que participó en el siglo XX, especialmente los de Afganistan y Rusia.Un pensamiento que hace meditar al lector, es aquel en el que menciona que en USA es terrorismo todo lo que hacen los demás contra ellos, pero no aceptan calificar como acciones terroristas o como violencia si sucede lo contrario (patrocinados por su gobierno como en el caso de Nicaragua y los ""contras"" o el bombardeo a una fabrica farmaceutica en Sudan y numerosos ejemplos más).Preferible leer un libro suyo que una recopilación de entrevistas repetitivas como es este caso."
3,OPEN YOUR EYES,"The important thing here is not whether or not Chomsky is sweet to the victims, is an anti-american, or trashes foreign US foreign policy. The important thing is that there's factual evidence to prove the links between White House, CIA, FBI, DoD and the attacks. As you know NORAD's F-16 never take off before noon. That explains the events of 9/11. And 98% americans would believe this statement if coming form Cheney....too many brainwashed fellas all over. You hard-core republicans or patriots, read this book, or better give the Senate Intelligence Committee transcripts a shot, and OPEN YOUR EYES.We are being kidnapped."
5,"If you hate Amerika, you'll love this book.","Yes, Noam Chomsky has completely marginalized himself with his previous works. Only the most radical, anti-amerika leftist would dare utter Chomsky's name in debate. However, I feel that with this book, a clearer picture is painted of Amerikan foreign policy. Yes, there is a vast and growing anti-western movement in the Muslim word. There are millions of Muslims now who would praise Allah for the chance of blowing up amerikan womenand children. Why? Because Islam is mostly a death-cult in the middle east? Read Noam Chomsky's latest work for a better answer."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a pretty avid reader of Noam Chomsky, but this book was a disappointment. What I found absurd was his comparison of 9-11 with Clinton's bombing of Sudan. They are not morally equivalent-actually Chomsky actually goes farther than claiming moral equivalence and says Clinton's actions were worse. It should be obvious that the bombing of Sudan was an attempt to kill Al-Qaeda members, not civilians, while the 9-11 terrorists deliberately targeted civilians, in the hope of killing as many as possible. Sam Harris does a great analysis of this book in his work The End of Faith. Todd Gitlin, as far from a right-winger as one can be, also harshly criticized 9-11 in the Nation.I cannot recommend this book. If you want a good Chomsky book, try Failed States or the Indispensable Chomsky."
3,INTERESTING POV BUT THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE,"I wasn't that impressed by this book but some of these negative reviews are mind boggling, for example, several reviewers refute Chomsky's claim that Bin Laden has CIA ties by stating that both Bin Laden and the CIA deny this claim.....ever consider that both parties are lying due to the embarrassment such a connection would cause? Of course Bin Laden was a CIA asset. We don't need chomsky to tell us that but, it gets annoying when some people insisting on refuting the claim and use lame official statments from less than credible parties as their source. Either way, there are far better books on 9/11 out there. Nevertheless, Chomsky does have an interesting POV and had I come across this book sooner, I might be inclined to give it a higher rating"
5,Think you know who the worst terrorists are?,A must read for all Americans who think they know where the worst terrorist acts are committed and by whom. This book presents undeniable facts and figures which will surely change the way you look at international terrorism and the concept of evil. The perpetrators are closer than you think.
1,Awful,"Chomsky is an intellectual leader of the anti-war left. In Chomsky's view, the World Trade Center deaths were regrettable but the unprecedented humiliation of the imperialist power - America - was an historic victory for social justice and human progress. He attributes the bad deeds of America's enemies to America itself - hence the search for ""root causes"" every time America is attacked. Irrational, Marxist nonsense."
1,Earth to Noam!,Why is America hated in the Islamic world? What's the better explanation: US foreign policy or simply envy and bitterness? Chomsky should read a little Victor Davis Hanson and get a grip on reality.
2,Rush Job,"This book is a collection of interviews Chomsky has done related to 9-11 and in each of them it feels like he's in a hurry, tired of repeating himself, having said what he says in this book many many times before. I knew when I bought this that it probably won't be a good introduction to Chomsky, and I regret buying it. Chomsky frequently says things like, ""...but this is common knowledge convered very well elsewhere..."" and this book felt like an illustration of that, like a web page that just links to good bits elsewhere. It felt more than a little opportunistic. Buy something else by Chomsky!"
5,Heavenly Creatures The Story of God's Love for His Animals and All of Creation,This book was written with great love of God and His creatures. The pslams and bible versuses tied the author's beliefs together in a very convincing way. I truly enjoyed reading the book and marked pages I reread.
5,Great Research Tool for Genealogists,Being of French-Canadian ancestry I find it very helpful having these books to fill in my family tree. I highly recommend them to anyone who may be of French-Canadian ancestry and we are legion but quiet. I just wish he would get to the Chalifou family. Well-written and fun to read.
1,Hopkins On/Off Gas Spout,"I wanted to say good things about this product. I NEEDED this spout to replace one for one of my 5-Gallon gas cans. Someone actually stole the spout from one of my gas cans, if you can beleive that. This spout is smaller so pours more slowly, plus, just the other day, it snapped off and broke from the slightest of pressure. I would NOT recommend this product. Honestly, it was a wasted purchase for me, to say the least!!!Ken j.Nehalem, ORNW Oregon Coast"
5,"Because we live in a semi-rural area, I couldn't get this item locally. Ordering online was my only option.","For many years, i have been impressed by the quality of Spornette brushes, and this one is typical of their standards."
5,HP Laserjet Printer,"I am so stupid for not buying the Laserjet sooner. Going through tons on Inkjet cartridges and costing my even more. Ok, my review... I LOVE IT!!!Bob"
3,"Lots of fun, but not durable","My kids love these waterslides, so do all of their neighborhood friends!! The only problem is that they are not durable. Little kids, under 4 yrs can use a long time, but any older and heavier child will be sure to break it. The seams rip at the base and the water flows out of the base. I usually have to buy a couple of these every summer due to breakage. They still are worth the purchase due to the hours of fun your kids will have playing on them!"
4,can't beat it.......especially for the price,"the kids had so much fun on it. I have a 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 yr old boys. I also babysit 6, 9, & 10 yr olds. They all played on it and had a blast. Other reviews said they fell apart really fast, but ours was fine. Just make sure you pick it up after they are finished with it each day. I put ours on the picnic table to let it dry out each use and they've played on it about 10 times or so. For 10 bucks.......you can't go wrong!"
4,Nice Chamber Music,"I recently came to know the music of the Russian composer Anton Stepanovivh Arensky (1861-1906). He was Rimsky-Korsakov's student at the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1879. After graduation in 1882, he began teaching music, having Rachmaninov and Scriabin among his students. He became a conductor, and was appointed Director of the Imperial Chapel in 1895.The 1st of his 2 Piano Trios was published in 1894, and the 2nd was composed in 1905, a year before his death. The 1st Trio is one of his best-known chamber compositions, while the 2nd is far less known. However, both show Arensky's skills in writing instrumental compositions. The 1st Trio seems more dynamic, with nicer melodies and themes.The trios are performed by 3 members of the well-known Borodin Quartet, taking at this occasion the name Borodin Trio. They are excellent Russian performers, who emigrated from the Soviet Union and settled in Canada."
3,Challenging,"One of the unique features about this excellent little book - and there are others - is that you have two intelligent minds approaching their subject with conviction and a degree of passion. While,clearly, they disagree; they are utterly respectful of each other's point of view. This form of civilised discussion opens eyes and allows a true learning opportunity"
4,"Well-reasoned, civil dialogue","I loved this little book. Eco is one of my heroes, and I knew of Martini's reputation, since there's been much speculation that he is one of the favorites to become the next Pope.What I liked most about the dialogue is that the two men clearly present their views and fully address the other's questions, without breaking down into the type of sensationalistic diatribe that passes for debate in the United States. Eco and Martini show respect for each other and each other's views, while clearly making a case for their own beliefs.My sole complaint is that of several other reviewers - the book was too short. I would have enjoyed more Q&A from Eco and Martini. The reactions of other intellectuals that were apparently included in the Italian and Spanish versions would have also been interesting reading.This book is well worth a purchase."

5,"So pretty, so sparkly","Very cute and comfortable, bought it again when UPS lost my first pair shipping them home from vacation. Had to have them, never enough sparkles in my life."
3,Evening wears.,"Like always,my girlfriend has a preference for nine west shoes and bags.This particular one blew her out.She loves wearing it for evening events so strongly recommended for such."
2,Exploring Ghastly Inner States In A Painfully Esoteric Style,"This book was just way over my head. I was impressed with Acker's ability to vividly expose the true inner monologues of her characters, but I just didn't grasp the point or even what was going on half the time. This book just totally bummed me out, and left me confused."
5,Still an all-time favorite,"As a 5th Gen Floridian, I can honestly say that Mr Newell's depiction of this time period in Florida is spot on ! I laughed until I cried. So many of the stories and situations are similar to those stories I grew up on attending box suppers and reunions in Loughman...long before it was a Disney suburb.If you can put your hands on a copy, you'll never let it go. Pass it to friends and family, but make sure you get it back for another read!"
5,Massagenus 768 massage chair,"Have had this chair a short time now but love the massage it give me , I'm a senior and my back when out on me about 5 day an two doctors before I got thechair, was still in lots of pain when I got the chair an put it together, It does require two people to do so an the manual that come with it. Not real hard todo if you can put thing together from a manual. I am a big guy 6'4"" 260 lbs but the massage is just right for my likes. Had another massage chair till earlier this year,though my back was ok because my back had not gone out in 6 years. That chair worked well an never gave me trouble, but the massages were to hard for me.The Massagenus 768 massage is more to my likeing, when I get up I feel refreshed, to me thats the test. I'm no expert, but the chair does it for me, so 5 stars. One morething this chair was $1000. cheaper than the one I got from Sharper Image, that also felt good for my pocket book for sure..............walter"
4,beautiful,I enjoyed the Celtic Book of Living and Dying very much. The art work was great. How I read the book was slow. I read passages the would Leave the book to ponder the words. I found this very satisfying.
5,Anything Celtic is a draw to me,I enjoy this time period and try to get my hands on anything that I can to learn more about the times.
3,Dream Lovers Dream Small,"Plot is a good thing with this movie. It's entertaining and worth the price of the video/DVD. It's about a couple working together to legally rob his friend. And it's a good idea with a little twist on the ending that's pretty clever. 'The friend' comes out ahead and clean. The Spader Sex is good and it's filmed well with colors that seem dark. The bad thing about this movie is it's dream sequences: they are 100% dumb; I cannot figure out a reason for them. Viewers understand 'the friend' - Spader - the Dream Lover is living a dream...and we can SEE that it's becoming a nightmare, we don't need foolish clowns cut-ins to bop us on the heads and say, ""DREAM!"" I personaly find it a tad bit unbeliveable that a hot, sweet Sexy Spader would not be the 'dream' of any woman. The female lead in this movie is beautiful. Watch it."
3,Very intimate loving movie,"I saw this movie at tv late night almost 10 years ago and I still remembering the recurrent dream Spader's character has ...This movie is most for the eclectic tastes looking for independent filmsthe script of this movie treats the life of the character as the people (at least me) does. The real and more intimate thoughts and feelings come to the surface through the dreams and the influence of the dreams in the cotidian life.And one thing this movie theaches is : never blow it, 'cause sometimes you only have only one opportunity."
3,Combining Sex And Violence Should Be NC-17,"The rating I give here, 3 of 5, is meaningless, as I could not finish the film. Despite the quality of the film and the acting, I find it difficult to watch tortured relationships (trigger warning). And, as much as this reflects real issues in our culture, I would prefer an NC-17 rating for any such combination violence and sexuality. But then, our morality rating system is broken and has never served anyone but the conservative moralists."
3,Special Unrated Version???,"""Dream Lover"" on VHS, was available as both the cut-to-shreds R-rated version, and as the Special Unrated Version, which was absolutely superior. I cannot get an answer from MGM, so I wonder, will this yet-to-be-released R-rated DVD be the two-thumbs down cut version, or has MGM made the only worthwhile decision to release this wonderful film in all its uncut unrated splendor (!)???"
4,Be Careful What You Wish For....,"4 1/2 StarsFor years, I have been waiting for the DVD release of this classy, sexy, chilling twist on Happily Ever After.James Spader is intriguing (OK, and gorgeous!) as the guy who seems to have everthing when he meets the girl of his dreams. Madchen Amick as the best psycho-chick I've seen in years, eventually has him doubting everyone around him, and everyone around him doubting his sanity. Who's more obsessed: him in his pursuit of the perfect life, or her and.... Hey! Watch the movie! I've never seen the unrated version, though I hope to. I am ""voting with my wallet"" and buying the rated version. It's a great movie and industry bottom-liners need to be reminded that there is a market (i.e. profit for them) in the release of great movies that aren't mega-blockbusters! So I'll watch and enjoy this one, and suggest you do, too. And when the unrated version comes out, I'll buy it, too!"
4,You don't see this one coming!,This movie may be old....but it still has the juice to keep you involved. Men will like it because it is a cautionary tale for them...and women will like it because we always suspected that we knew someone like her!Wonderful performances here...definately worth a look.
4,DVD released on June 1st,"I really enjoyed this movie, simply because of James Spader's performance. And for all of you fans who wanted this on DVD, it is going to be released in June of this year. Enjoy!"
5,"Oh, Madchen!","Like many others, (except maybe for Twin Peaks fans, of which I confess I am not one), this is where I first saw Madchen Amick, and what a film to begin with.She is so sexy, the screen almost steams up! She is truly gifted at playing dangerous femme fatales and she isn't really that tall. But let's face it, what man could say no to such a pretty face?James Spader, who has made a living pretty much being the victim in films such as these, and is terrific at it, is also terrific. He manages to match Amick, which can't be easy and their scenes together really sizzle. The one scene which stands out is a long flash of Madchen walking to the bathroom with her bare backside smiling at us fellas, which we will always be grateful for. Mind you, Madchen is part Swedish, so maybe it's a natural thing for her. Either way, terrific thriller and I have several other films starring the great Madchen Amick too. One of those actresses from the 80's who you don't forget. Oh, Madchen!"
3,Don't get this one...,"My gf and I eagerly awaited the sensuous part with a fit Spader (he worked out for months first) and a lovely Amick (I was mesmerized). Guess what --- someone decided to cut it out. It's on my old VHS, not here. Still a bit of nudity but no extended love scene. What person decided to take it out and for what reason? It makes the movie. Women and men will be disappointed or not know what they are missing.Not a bad movie, but skip it. (Don't get the DVD anyway.) If you want, spend a mint on the old, uncut VHS which is sexy yet not at all like a cheap porn flick --- it's much better and leaves enough to the imagination resulting in a real turn on that also better explains the movie. Great for couples. It was just right, especially with two fit, beautiful actors.What person did this? The rating did not change. Why?"
2,draw a trend line,"draw two more trend lines. One equidistant above and one equidistant below the first trend line, either buy or sell when the price crosses the one of the two outside trend lines............the trident strategy."
1,I never got the book or a refund,"Dont try to buy this as you will never get it or get a refund after you waste time trying to get this seller to respond and send the book. Too bad, I would have much rather had the book than a dispute with Amazon. Cheap."
2,"An Uninspired, Text-Book Read","I have to strongly disagree with the previous Amazon reviews praising this book. If you are looking for an in-depth telling of the Donner Party story rich with anecdotes and emotion, this is not the book for you. I made the mistake of assuming that the chronological format of this book would give the author an interesting opportunity to share details from specific days of the party's journey. Instead, every chapter is a wash, not nearly using the referenced primary sources to their fullest, most revealing and telling potential. The book is formatted much like a middle-school text book and reads like one, too. The writing is poor, bare-bones, repetitive and elementary. However, if you're looking for a coffee-table book that guests can simply open and say, ""Oh, you have a book on the Donner Party"", get this book; that is all it is good for."
4,Excellent For Beginner,"If you have never programmed in Turbo Pascal, than you should almost certainly get a copy of this book. It does indeed teach Delphi from grounds up and you will learn a great deal.If you are fully conversant with Pascal Syntax and structure, you might gain something reading through this book, but I do believe that you will gain more by reading through Tom Swan's book Delphi Bible followed by Charles Calvert Delphi Unleashed"
3,For the freshman programmer,"This book is, as the authors state, a classroom text for the beginning progammer. I could see this book working for a first semester programmer using Delphi as a menas to learn programming with a 4GL. But this book leands little to even a less than seasoned developer.There is a niche in the programming community for this book in that Delphi has come of age and so has most of the contempoary books. Few authors today want to go back and repeat what they wrote for Delphi I.I fine it very desirable that Delphi is being used as a programming teaching tool. It is far more suited for the task than VB. Hopefully books of this order will encourage this endeavor."
1,Why so pricey,This book is for version 3. Borland has released version 8. Why isnt this book cheaper?A book on AutoCAD 12 would sell for $3.00.
2,Not Recommended,"If you have programmed in any other language, don't buy this book.The text is very sparse and hardly adds any weight to the langauge of object pascal. You are better off geting some other title.If you have never programmed in your life, and you want to program in Delphi than the book will suffice to get you off the ground."
1,Wrong size clubs shipped,"I just got these. The box marked was with the 8-12 size. Inside, however, I got the pruple golf bag with the clubs for a 4-7 year old (the driver is 36""). I'll be sending these back."
2,description incorrect,"I ordered these twice and each time I got the wrong size sent to me. The pink ones only come in the Large and not the smaller size for my very petite 6 year old. Amazon or the manufacturer is really bad about clearly stating that the pink set is the larger size and the purple set is the smaller size. I ordered it from 3 different places and all 3 times, I thought I was ordering the smaller set and I would receive the pink larger size."
4,Wrong color,"Like mentioned in another review, I expected pink clubs but got the purple. I ordered the Large set for my five year old (she's very tall for her age). Somewhere they need to do a better job of being clear on what color you will receive, or give you a choice. I did not even see purple listed. With that said, the clubs and bag seem like quality peices, well constructed and weighted. The stand bag looks like it will hold up for a few years. I think this set is well worth the price of $69.00. Would give 5 stars but I will wait to see how they hold up to actually use, and the fact that I did not get the pink ones."
5,Perfect birthay gift for a 7 yr old girl who wants to golf with dad,"I must admit, it took longer than I thought to come in, but it was well worth the wait. They missed her June birthday party but I was able to print a picure and give her the golf balls. The clubs arrived today and they are great. Can't wait t to give them to her weekend."
3,confusing!,"in their Vintage Glaze description they say: ""Vintage contains 61 percent Brazilian #1 White Carnauba by volume, the highest in any product designed to protect automotive finishes."" ... highest? but still as in less than their own Royal Glaze which they claim is 70%?in addition the Swissvax Paul Dalton Crystal Rock contains 76%! ... all VERY confusing (or very not correct?)"
1,BORING!,"This is a dull narrative delivered in a bored monotone by someone who doesn't seem to care very much. Background ""music"" seems to be some sort of music machine dross. You're better off with Bukowski spoken-word CDs."
5,Home and Away multi pack Escalade NE Pats,nice add on to my growing New England collection. nicely built and fully detailed pair.
2,Judy Garland in Hollywood,"I'm a big Judy Garland fan, but found this CD lacking. Her voice didn't have that extra force she always puts into her songs. Some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep. It says ""original soundtrack"". Maybe it needs to be re-mastered. It certainly won't be my favorite."
4,A Bit Too Concise,"I like the size, but I prefer the definitions and content of the American Heritage Dictionary."
5,Concise Oxford American Dictionary,"This book came in 3 days, in brand new, excellent condition and at an excellent price. It is real value for the money."
1,........Go back to the drawing board.........!,........Who every put this together left ALL of Frankie's GOOD TUNES on the cutting room floor!
5,Frankie Lymon was an awesome singer and perrformer.,"With only being 26 years old, i am infatuated with old music. I always liked the song Why Do Fools Fall In Love by Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers but when I saw the movie I just got real excited about him, his life, and his music. I wish I could have rown up inhis era to really know him as a entertainer. Long live Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers."
1,The wheel frame material chosen is too weak for this kind of toy,"We bought this toy truck before thanksgiving for our son few years ago, he played for less than half hour and was complaining that one of the wheel was broken. We found out the wheel frame is made of very thin plastic, We think the plastic material is not right one for this kind of toy. It must be chosen for profit purposes only."
1,Not good,Can't get the rods to stay together...falling apart out of the package. These rods are cheaply made and will not last.
5,The wonders of Life folios,These books are magnificient! Not only are they educational but they come with microscope slides within each folio to go along with the Life Science material. Dr. Joseph Greene who wrote these books was a scientific genius! I wish he were still alvie so I could work with him!!!
3,Travel Guide,Knopf Guide: Egypt (Knopf Guides)I did not find this travel guide as good as EYE Witness DK guides. I will stay with DK books from now on.
4,eclectic,"talking heads, nusrat fateh ali khan, dead can dance. this cd has nothing to do with the preceding 3 groups/artists and certainly does NOT sound like any of them. but if you can appreciate ALL 3 of the preceding groups, then you'll definitely enjoy this best of cd. i liked it so much, i sprung for the 3box set both for me and my best friend. interesting rhythms, musical instruments. the vocal talents of the artists definitely stand out. don't think of it as some type of polka recording. the producers certainly kept western tastes/sensibilities in the back of their heads when they made these choices/recordings. you'll listen to it more than once per year. highly recommended. 4 stars (not 5 because it doesn't have catchy pop hooks;but then again, that's why you'll listen to it several times over your lifetime."
2,I Don't Get It,"I read the synopsis for this book in a ""Best of.."" book list for 2001. It's described as a psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who saves a man from drowning. The catch is the man he saves was once a client of his who he inadvertently helped send away to a correctional institute because of damaging testimony.Sounds good right? I missed it. I didn't find the book tense at all. Every time it started to work towards something I thought was going to be remotely suspenseful, it petered out. I was really disappointed. In fact about the highest praise I can give it is that at just over two hundred pages it reads like a halfway decent short story. A not terribly exciting short story, but a short story never the less."
2,Two person play as a novel,"I will admit that I listened to this Audio Book on drive to and from Las Angeles to Los Vegas. I thought it a good chance to be introduced to Pat Barker who seems to get such rave reviews. This is basically a two person character study in the guise of a psychological thriller that is not all that thrilling. I found the store interesting enough and the writing crisp, but thesecondary plot of Tom Seymour and his wife seems lost as she walks out of his life just when he is consumed with this former child patient who returns to extract his revenge. Or does he? I will give this a marginal thumbs up because the two main characters are well written and vivid, with Danny Miller the tormented child murderer an excellent character. But in the end I did not find this very satisfying to listen to and doubt I would have finished it if I had picked it up as a book."
3,Alright...,"This was a good psychology lesson, but nothing else. I got it from the library 'cause I liked the cover. It was alright, but I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite books."
1,The worst approach to database design I've ever seen,"It's a good thing these folks are book writers and academics and do not design databases for a living. The writers pretend that such realities as deadlines and budget do not exist. The text is filled with Entity Relationship diagrams that must add 200% to the cost of their designs. The book is very difficult to read and if you're already designing databases, this methodology will drive you up the wall. Teachers, Please do not inflict this book on any more students."
1,I hate this book,"This is the required textbook for a graduate course I am taking in Information Studies. Having been assured by the professor that one needed no math, science, or computer background to do well, I put aside my reservations. But here we are, one month into the semester, with this book as our only teaching tool, and I am failing the course. (I thus far have a 3.93 average in grad school)The bottom line - this book is NOT a good instructional tool, especially not for beginners."
2,Wrong Book,"the seller sent me a book that is not suppose to be sold in United States, and the ISBN does not match with the one he previosly stated. So, basicly wrong book..."
1,If you're new to databases...,"then good luck with this book. I agree with the other ""bad"" reviews. This book is the most difficult to understand, ESPECIALLY if you are new to database systems, or at least not familiar with the ""technical details"" of databases. I had to use this book for a class, and if it wasn't for my experienced database friend to explain what they mean, I would have definately failed this class. I love one of the previous reviews who used the word ""horrid"" - this is a perfect term for the book. This book lacks in explaining a term in a way that makes sense. It would just show the term and several examples, but you have no idea why they have extra terms in the example or why is the example written in that way, which defers from the original explanation. It just doesn't make any sense. Anyway, I do not recommend this book. If you do have to use it, try to find a tutor as soon as possible."
1,zzzzzzzzzz,"this book gives me a major headache. unfortunately, it's assigned material for an intro database class i'm taking. as a business, not computer science major, I find this book to be overly complicated with too much verbiage. this is an intro book, it should be simple, yet it reads like a math book. just explain the simple concepts and not go into elaborate detail with terminology and database mathematical concepts. this book is geared toward hard-core techies. if at all possible, save your money for an easier and more entertaining book, not a dry, boring, incomprehensible one. alright, now that i've let out my frustrations, i'll get back to studying this book now for the upcoming final. wish me luck. i'll need it!"
2,Information Lost Among Words,"I honestly do not see how this book could be useful to anyone. If you are a beginner, you will soon get lost among the endless, and pointless words, searching for the rare important information. I read paragraph after paragraph that had no real point, or would begin to describe a subject, and then just drop it, stating ""but this is beyond the scope of this book."" Then why spend two pages talking about it and refer to the concept later?? If you're someone looking for a good reference, look elsewhere as well. Most subjects do not get explained to the fullest, except for the database design model. I'd talk about this more, but it's beyond the scope of this review."
5,well written,"This book was very well written in the general sense. It covers all the aspects used to design a relational database from beginning to end. I found the chapter on query optimization quite interesting. It really explained what makes a query more efficient and faster.This book does not explain how to use such database tools as Oracle 8i, and MS Access although they are mentioned briefly. A number of chapters in the text were a little repetitive, they helped to illustrate the theory involved by working through a real world example.All in all this is an excellent text for an introduction to database design course however, this text should not be bought if you are looking to learn a specific database management tool."
2,Careful now...,"The product is a stack of 3-hole punch papers, unbound, which seems to require the accompanying CD-rom. I wish I had known that before I bought it."
5,Rediscover the Real You!,"I give this book the highest of 5 stars and encourage everyone interested in moving their life to greatness to buy this book, read it, read it again, study it and apply the lessons that Kevin shares. I do workshops called Rediscover Your Life through taking affirmative action 4 life. This is exactly what this book is about. Get the book and rediscover your true purpose & destiny! Make it happen & make a difference!! Your Best Investment is You."
4,Inspiring,"Kevin Liles is the guy from Def Jam that most people don't recognize. Everyone knows Russell, most people know Rick Rubin. Kevin's one of the guys who came on board in the days when the company was transforming from start-up to big-time. He delivers a really simple message throughout Make It Happen... work harder than everyone else. That's the real gist of the 242 pages. There are chapters that have other themes, but the underlying cause of his success comes out in every section. Liles worked hard and was single-minded in the pursuit of his goals."
5,excellent,This book is an easy read and is a must read for anybody who works in the Hip-Hop industry. I highly reccommend it.
5,Level-headed advice,"I attended high school with Mr. Liles. Although I did not really know him personally, I remember that he was always ambitious and level-headed. It is refreshing to see him give back to our community and offset some of the negative press that our area of West Baltimore has received. I am glad that he is an excellent role model for today's young people."
5,Good quality and match for the UCO Micro lantern,Good flame... better than cheap tea lights from a home decoration or discount store. Worked very well in my UCO Micro lantern. Each lasted 3-4 hours.
2,Red's Ruin,"This book is an easy read, but a difficult review. If you want to read about Cornbread Red's association with unknown gamblers playing for huge (unnamed, split-seven-ways) stakes, this is the book for you. If you want anecdotes about other greats he encountered, forget it. Danny Jones and Fats get brief mentions. The rest is mostly about Rubie, Bones, Al, and a host of other household names. Not really a bad book, but it could have been much better."
3,mixed views,"anxiously awaited book, it came in good time. only thing was the cover was very scratched. enjoyed the speed of delivery but thought the book would be in beter shape."
3,was hoping for more and did not match stock hangers,The installation for a 2004 Jeep wrangler X was off by several inches. I was able to torgue one hanger and make it work but had to order a longer universal hanger for the mid hanger. Sound is slightly better than stock.
4,book I remember,"I first read this book when I was a young woman. I have always loved history and historical fiction. I felt that this book gave a very close portrayal of the kind of relationship which could develop between ""cousins"" and very closely related persons, especially noble ones. It made me quite understanding of the bond between CharlesII and his sister---even as he used her for his own ends. I want to read it again and own a copy----even a paperback."
4,"A Gift To Us, The Viewers!","A slightly screwy love affair, between a man, a woman and the woman's autistic brother (I don't mean in the incestuous, three-way way).Man and woman meet. They are both such opposites... quiet/loud, educated/not educated, quick tempered/laid back and a few more extremes thrown in for fun. Then, we add in the brother who is very upset having to share his sister. Can boyfriend and brother ever get along or will brother ruin the made-in-heaven relationship in it's budding stages.A delightful respite from all the heavy handed love affairs currently around for viewing.One of the best Independant Films I've seen. Thank God it wasn't a Major Studio film... that would surely have ruined it!"
5,Well worth checking out,I saw this film at the Stoneybrook Film Festival this summer and thought it was fantastic. The dialogue is sharply written and makes for a witty exchange between the 3 main characters. An atypical but rewarding romantic comedy. Standout performance by Alicia Goranson- I couldn't believe that I was watching the girl from Roseanne.
3,hard times for those with strange siblings,"Myra is a blond with a real brother problem in the big city.In New York's Queens it seems that people with real emotional problemshave again reverted to the 19th century where they kept the dotty aunt in the attic room.In the 50's and 60's we made some progress with the careof the troubled minds. The republicans years said they aren't a public problemand turned them out on the street. Ludlow,but for his sister's love,is a soon to be dead homeless person.The problem is that she wants a life of her ownand almost by accident finds Reggie.The fireworks that happen as a result of love in bloomare really not very pleasant.I liked the movie, but think it isn't for the faint of heartor children who think all is right in the world."
3,two and a half stars - this is a Lifetime Channel level movie,"There are some incredibly sweet moments in this movie. I loved Alicia Goranson on Roseanne and she is truly darling. But her acting range at this juncture is dominated by three or four wide-eyed expressions that, over time, become cloying. This movie is predictable and the Ludlow character does not have enough charm to carry his share of the movie. Over all, a mild disappointment. The movie you should see instead is Me and You and Everyone We Know."
5,excellent reference. Note there is a 2011 ed. out now.,"This is one of the most highly respected references in our library on the subject of women's health, particularly amongst students and practitioners in our herbal medicine department.You should know however that a 2011 edition is now available (for $160 Australian dollars) that has several new sections and many enhancements of older sections.The older editions are still viable and acurate."
4,"Women, Hormones & the Menstrual Cycle: Herbal & Medical Solutions from Adolescence to Menopause Ruth Trickey","This book is aimed to increase our understanding of what happens to women throughtout their cycle. The issues that are adressed within, are highly informative and introduces the reader to new issues that orthodox medicine is only beginning to understand or ignores completely."
4,Suprisingly Entertaining,I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this video. But I really enjoyed it. My child likes to watch it over and over and over. It's probably because there are a lot of child actors in it. I recommend this video to parents and teachers and anyone who works with children.
3,Too In-Depth for Casual Use,"I'm sure this book would be good for some, but it was too in-depth for me. The adult section doesn't even start until page 57. I wanted to use this for myself, but I'm not going to record everything from my childhood, so the first half of the book would be wasted. Then it asks for so much detailed information about all sorts of tests. Maybe if you have a history of health problems, you'd want to record all of this. But for a healthy adult, it doesn't seem necessary. In fact, when I go to the doctor, they don't even tell me what my blood pressure was, etc. - because it's not an issue. So if you're simply looking for a book to record basic things like immunizations & notes from appointments, this will probably be too much for you. It is a very nice hard back book though. And I'm sure it's useful to some."
2,Beautiful photos but no useful information,"This book has lovely pictures of ways to use and display paper of all types, like tissue paper flowers and ornaments, but there are few clear instructions. There is also a resource guide but no information as to what materials used in the book came from the listed sources. Apparently, if you want specific information on the details of the layouts you have to buy another book intitled ""Details"". This book was very dissapointing."
1,Image does not match what you get!,"The image showed a 12 pack of Sharpie mini markers, but I received a 4 pack. After the fact I realized the description is for a 4 pack; though that wasn't clear at the time of placing my order. I would not have paid over $7 plus $2 shipping for a 4 pack of mini markers. It is very frustrating when the image shown is not actually what is being sold."
5,marker on keyring,These are small. The cap doesn't fit on a regular sharpie so no interchangeability of caps for the key ring. The key ring tip will pop off the top of the cap if you want less marker bulk obtruding in your pocket or just want a quieter marker. This sharpie is a little harder to open then a regular sharpie and has a better seal in the cap then the regular ones. If you aren't that dexterous to begin with the size of this marker may hinder your ability to open it.
1,I too was deceived....,"I also was expecting a 12 pack of pastel colors. I paid $10.00 for a stupid 4 pack of sharpies. I think this is false advertising and if this company can't advertise without being deceitful, amazon should not allow them to be on their marketplace. We will see how Office Quarters handles this return."
5,Rookie Readers are Great for ESOL students!,I'm using this book for some ESOL students who are 8th graders and have a lack of prior education. I'm teaching them map skills and helping them learn about the world. The Oceans are a concept they need to learn for history and Earth Science.
3,The Bigg Ned Kletz,I enjoyed the parts by the actor Ned Kletz. He really is a professional! My sides hurt after I got through the driving scene. Sandles really are a fashion fauxpah...- Critical
4,A Charmer on a Shoestring,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw this video. I never thought it could be done. Yet, the results are on the screen. A witty, urbane piece of work, that once again proves a group of talented and motivated people can do practically anything, no matter what the budget."
5,Low Budget Film Loaded with Laughs,"First time filmmaker, Charles Shrewsbury, has produced a highly enjoyable film, full of more wit, honesty and charm than many first-run movies I've seen. The fun begins when Bill and Laura decide to announce their engagement on a weekend getaway with two other couples. Bill's second thoughts have Mr. Shrewsbury and co-writer, Todd Hagans, moving the story forward using humor and a keen sense of the differences between the sexes. And, although the actors are not household names, they are very good at portraying their characters' personalities and quirks.This film may not have had a big budget, but it's a lot of fun and definitely worth seeing. Unlike a lot of movies I've seen and forgotten rather quickly, this one stayed with me for a long time. For me, that's the sign of a good one. I recommend it to anyone wanting to relax and laugh at the never-ending battle between men and women."
5,big announcement,"must say a real surprise how entertaining and captivated this movie had me. I didn't know or expect much but was pleased by this flick, thank you joe for recommending it. the actors did a good job; some excellent, others good; while the writing was a solid job, with many surprises I didn't expect. Bravo! a real needle in a haystack."
2,Decent look at racism,"This is black professor of English George Armstrong's latest book, an examination of racism. The book is narrated by John, a black man in Kentucky during 1914. John appears to be a normal black man, but he has a terrible secret: he is a hermaphrodite! He manages to conceal this terrible secret from his wife of 15 years, Estelle, but only by making a bargain with the Devil.Although many believe it to be a masterpiece, I thought this book was retarded."
3,Had me until the end,"I thought this book was pretty good, but I didn't like the way book ended. I thought perhaps something different might happen then the usual predictable ending."
3,good-but,"I thought this book had a really great message to it that lots of people can learn from. A young black man faces the toughest form of adversity, death, and with the help of a another black man named Grant, he stares his cruel fate right in the eye and becomes a man before he dies. This is the reason why I would reccomend people to read this because of the message it sends: to become a man and do the right thing no matter what the situation is. However, I do have a reason why certain people should not read this book. Because if you have a short attention span, you may not be able to make it through. There are not many interesting plot twists and there really is no drama or mystery. You know as soon as you start to read, the fate of the young man."
1,A Lesson Before Dying,"This was a very long winded book. It was not a page turner at all. I found myself not wanting to finish the book for as short as it was. I thought it would get better, but it never did. At times the writer leaves you hanging as to what is happening with the prisoner and then out of no where, the writer takes you back to the prisoner. Somewhat confusing and very boring. The only excitement is when the teachers go off into a field and have sex. I do not understand why that was even brought into the book. Boring. This is the second worst book I have bought going by the Oprah Winfrey Book Club Review. Bad Taste."
1,"Slow, dull, unintersting, and characterless","This book never grabs your interest. The plot is a great (yet tired) idea, with limitless potential, but the author falls so short of either making the plot go anywhere, or developing any characters, that you turn page after page waiting and hoping that something will grab your interest or pull an emotional string, and all you are left with is disappointment."
3,ok,"I was good just for the thing that I need it, but it has some writing inside, wich didn't help me a lot with my homework, but in general good"
2,It took way to long to get into,"the book in its entirity was a great book but for people like me i like to get into in with in the first 5 chapters of so, but it took way way to long to get in to it, but it was very good once you get to the 25-26 chapters I think it took to long"
3,"While ernest gaines made good points, it took him too long.","In retrospect, i feel that ""a lesson before dying"" had some very good points to make. It was written well, and ernest gaines conveyed an image of life that does not fade from the mind easily. However, there was one characteristic of it that lessesned its enjoyment for me. In many novels you have to give a book maybe four to five chapters to warm up and introduce character's lives and personalities. While in ""a lesson before dying"", it seemed to take a good 24-25 chapters. The only real substance began around the 26th chapter. Still, I found this ending-substance to be worth having waded through the long, slow start."
3,Grant vs Ambrose,"""A Lesson Before Dying"" by Ernest Gaines was not exactly my cup of tea, but I did take a certain likeing to this book. The most intriguing part was when the roles were reversed between Grant an Reverend Ambrose. Rev. Ambrose finally breaks it down to Grant by making him realize just what exactly the Rev. was trying to do. Making Grant see that sometimes you have to do things you don't want just to improve the situation. I feel this is something Grant never expected Rev. Ambrose to tell him. This confrintation between the two made Grant respect the Rev. more than in the beginning.Also, this made Ambrose not seem so arrogant and self rightous. Thus, makeing the Rev and Grant more likable characters."
3,A lesson before dying,"A lesson before dying is a great book. It takes place in a small cajun town, back in the 1940's. A man named Jefferson is accused of murder and is found guilty. Jefferson is put on death row and considered a hog by many. Grant Wiggins is asked to teach Jefferson and turn him into a man. Grants strugles with Jefferson but he eventually does the imposible and makes a man out of Jefferson. The story is turly touching and I encourage everyone to read this book."
3,Paul and Grant,"This book is a great example of how things used to be. It's a good book to read if you're a part of this generation. The relationship between Paul, the white security guard at the prison that Jefferson what sent to, and Grant, I thought, is very special. With the time period and how things were back then, that was very unique. Paul was very passionate about the Jefferson ordeal, but he knew there was nothing he could do about. For that reason, he did whatever he could to be of any help to Jefferson and/or Grant. This showed great character."
4,The Best Summer Reading Ever,"I thought that, ""A Lesson Before Dying,"" was one of the best books I have ever read for summer reading. It was about a black man named Jefferson who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He gets caught up in a murder that he did not commit, but was convicted because of his race. It was a really heartbreaking moment in the book when he was convicted and I was really disappointed. Then after he was convicted the rest of the book was pretty self-explanatory. I think the title gave the book away, but I still thought that it was well written. I really like this book and it is now one of my favorites. It was the best story I have ever had the privilege of reading."
4,English Class Book Review,"The novel A Lesson Before Dying has a realistic 1940s Southern Louisiana setting and perhaps the realistic setting is due, in part, and parallel to the childhood life of the author, Ernest Gaines. That said, the book revolves around a black individual, who was convicted under an entirely white jury, the book paints a portrait as if he was innocent. He supposed murdered a white store clerk in a robbery gone bad, however that is up to the reader to decide. As he is waiting on Death Row, the local school teacher, Grant, at the request of his aunt Emma, tries to turn what Jefferson describes as a 'hog' into a man. Thus, Grant, against his own volition agrees and attempts, numerous times in vain, but in the end turns Jefferson into a man who is willing to accept his death with pride and dignity. All in all Jefferson 'showed more strength than anyone in the room.'"
4,it was good,A Lesson Before Dying is one of those books that takes some getting into. The story is good but the writing style is much better. I read it as a freshman in college and found it an easy read for the average eighth grader. I liked it because it was an easy read that was not complex in syntax yet rich in context. Not one of my favorites but the story is welcome for debate in the classroom.
5,This was chosen as Chaffey College book of the year in 1999!,Ernest J. Gaines definitely captures the heat of the south in his story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He has brought us all back to a place where society lived in fear and scapegoats were needed to hide their own. Too bad that's the way it was and could be again if we forget where we came from. Thanks to Ernest J. Gaines we are reminded once again!
3,It was adequate,"I found the book a little slow. It took a lot for me to complete reading it. Although I liked the characters, I found them a little dull. There wasn't anything that just reached out and grabbed me to keep me hooked."
4,A Lesson Worth Learning,"A Lesson Before Dying is a novel about Jefferson, a black man sentensed to death for a crime he did not commit. Jefferson is accused of being at the worng place at the wrong time, yet it is because of his color that he is not given a fair trial. This novel shows the hardships, trials, and crooked morals of a white society on a black man.It is Grant Wiggins, Jefferson's, teacher, who instructs Jefferson to stand up to society and die with dignity. The task undertaken by Grant is not easy because he too being black is treated like a criminal when he visits with Jefferson. However, it is through his unwillingness that Grant himself has a change of mind and wants to visit Jefferson to help him overcome his fear and walk. In short A Lesson Before Dying in the end is a classic."
5,wonderful African-American work of literature,"""A Lesson Before Dying"" is a moving fictional account of a black man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. Jefferson is convicted of a convenience store murder, being the only person left alive after a shootout, despite having not pulled any triggers. His lawyer attempts to get him acquitted by telling the jurors that they might as well convict a ""hog,"" which sparks the book's main storyline - Jefferson's aunt convinces local black teacher Grant Wiggins to visit Jefferson in prison and teach him how to be a man, instead of a hog. Gaines's prose is plain but evocative; ultimately, the novel explores the themes of racial identity in the face of oppression, universal human dignity and worth, and what it means to be a (hu)man."
3,Only thing good of book is at the ending,"I read the book for my 10th grade English class. I kept wondering why was this book picked until I reached the end when I came upon the diary of Jefferson, the black boy sentenced to death. Yes he learned that lesson before he died, but I hope the author would make that progress a bit more presentable than a verbose, uninteresting way of filling in unrelated-info to test the readers' patience.I found the book amid my old junk last week and wanted to read it again, but without a teacher and a class I lack the patience to endure the 19 or so chapters before the climax, and when I jumped to it directly...it tasted awefully pain without the contrast of all the boring content before it."
5,Riveting book that challenges you to think!,"I picked up this book not only because it was on Oprah's reading list but because it was centered in the South and dealt with the death penalty. Mr. Gaines really makes you come to grips with the effects of segregation on all peoples, both black and white. What a devasting statement he has made by writing ""A Lesson Before Dying"" without having to preach all the negative impacts segregation has had on our society as a whole. That men and women can rise above what has been dished out truly speaks to mankind's resiliency, greater nature and desire to live. This book could easily be used in U.S. history courses covering this sad era in America."
5,For background on Ernest Gaines,_A Lesson Before Dying_ is a great American novel and Mr. Gaines is one of our country's greatest novelists. Readers interested in stimulating discussions of his books should pick up a copy of _Critical Reflections on the Fiction of Ernest J. Gaines_ (University of Georgia Press).
3,A Lesson Before Dying,"This is a story about a fairly uneducated man who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Thourgh out the story as Jefferson, the convicted murderer, waits for the final day to come the black teacher of the town, Grant Wiggins, is called upon by Jefferson's godmother to help him. Grant is asked to teach Jefferson that he is not less than human. The end of the story was very emotional when Jefferson was asked at his final moments if he had any last words. His response was ""Tell Nanna I walked."" This very simple sentence has much deeper meaning, he was basically saying that he is a man, as much of a man as any other man in that room, if not more."
3,"Terrible Lesson, Excellent Book","This book gives keen, painful insight on the realities faced by African-Americans of the southern United States in the recent past. The main settings of the story are a plantation, the plantation schoolhouse, a jail cell and a bar. The protagonist is a school teacher who agonizes over his vocation to teach (which he refuses to accept as his true vocation), his love for a woman and his yearning to be free.More than one lesson can be learned from this book. Lessons about racism, intolerance, friendship, brotherhood and potential for change."
1,ok,A Lesson Before Dying was a great lesson. Im not really sure what the book was about but im sure it was good. I didn't really read it so go read it and tell me about it.
2,Bad,"I had to read this book for school, and, first let me say I'm not just some highs chooler who hates to read, my favorite writers are Kafka, Faulkner and Dostoevsky, but this book was all but utter trash. It had a few meaningful moments, but generally it was devoid of characterization, emotion, and plot. I give it two stars for trying, but it just tries too hard to be great. Gaines-Accept average."
2,NOT ANOTHER ONE,"I have read tons of books just like this one. This is just another book written by an angry African American author, who still feels the ""pain"" from being persecuted because of his race. In fact the author wrote it because he found that there weren't many books written by African Americans in the public library. The book has a few good points, but it is constructed around the whole racism issue. I know racism is a big issue, but what's done is done. OK we get it, African Americans were treted very badly. I guess the author didn't have some other original idea."
1,This book sucked.,"Ugh. I had to read this bok for school and it sucks. Preformatted, horrible, and boring. Dave is so wrong with his review. The only lesson that I learned is that the book sucks."
3,A good book in general,"I had mixed feelings about this book. Most of the time I loved how interesting it was and all the sub plots. However there were a few parts to this book where it felt like the author was taking too long to get the point across. Aside from those instances, the book had a very great story line, the language in it was spectacular. There were also a few underlying themes that reminded you what era the book was taking place in. I feel like I should read this book again knowing the entire story, I'll probably pick up on a few, more subtle details."
5,Life and death is 1940s Lousiana.,"This is a wonderful novel about segrationist Lousiana and about two men trying to become men. One is a slow, barely literate young black wrongly accused of murder, and the other is a young black profesional working as a teacher in a plantation school. Both are trying to attain their manhood. The young person convicted of murder becomes a man first and shows the community what it is like to face a grim fate with dignity and courage. The young black professional learns from this person how he should conduct his life.This is wonderful story with good life examples of how people become adults. It is not only serious, but has some good stories that I chuckled over. A great read."
4,A Lesson Well Learned,"A Lesson Before Dying is a story about a young black man, Jefferson, that is accused of murder. His lawyer trys to get him off by calling him a ""hog."" Jefferson is found guilty and sentenced to death. He is going to die not only knowing he did not commit a crime but also convinced that he is a hog.The main character, Grant Wiggins, is forced by his aunt to go visit Jefferson in jail. She wants Grant to convince Jefferson that he is not a hog. Grant finds the task hopeless and does not want to do it. Grant considers his visits to Jefferson are a waste of time to him and he would rather run away from it all.Overall I thought that the book was very good. I felt that the lessons that people could draw out from the book. The book was very adequate about dealing with issues that were common in the 1940s. I would recommend this book to someone that likes books that have morals."
2,Could've Been Better,"I read this book thinking that it would be great. The main character, Grant, is an unfeeling person for half of the novel, and then miraculously starts to care for others. It was contrived. I just didn't believe it. The end of the novel should have been labeled ""YOU NEED TO CRY."" I didn't shed a tear, and I usually do when something is well written. I would not recommend this book to a friend."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"While reading this novel, I felt I like I was reading the work of an immature high schooler, trying to relate a thought-provoking story. Gaines took what could have been an interesting idea, and sculpted it into one of the cheesiest, most boring novels ever written. Gaines poorly develops an unlikable, selfish protagonist, Grant, and then drags us through the hardships in his relationships with his aunt, girlfriend (whose relationship with Grant definitely brings out the worst in Gaines' writing abilities), and his death-row inmate charity case Jefferson. Jefferson's diary is perhaps the only effective part of the book in provoking emotion. There was no lesson to be learned from this novel, other than NEVER LISTEN TO OPRAH!!"
5,Hard Lessons,"This is book about racism in the south prior to the civil rights movement. This a story about the oppression of African Americans. This is a story of hope. Jefferson is an innocent man and he will die because a white man has died and he was there when it happened. Grant is an educated black man who has come back home to teach school. Jefferson must learn from Grant how to be a man, ironicly that is the same thing Grant must learn from Jefferson. This novel is a must read. It is as accurate as you are likely to get when it comes to pre-civil rights race relations. The story is very emotional and will pull at the hardest of hearts."
4,a classic spin,"this book goes right ti the heart of our history on how things were for ""blacks"" at that time. When I read books like this it a constant reminder for me to appreicate life today. I would ask any person who read this book do so with an open mind & heart to understand the true meaning of this book"
4,A Lesson Before Dying,"Excellent, high-quality fiction. Gaines is a masterful storyteller and while it took me a long time to focus and find a rhythm, I won't deny that the writing is first-rate. This should be in everyone's library."
3,Mediocre,"Interesting story, but the emotions become cliches at times and the writing is not as polished as one might hope."
4,Interesting,"This novel caught, then lost, then recaptured my attention. I can't say that I care too much for Grant. I definitely didn't like the way he treated his kids-or his girlfriend for that matter. Jefferson I was touched by and by his transformation. The last two chapters were by far the best part. But there were way too many pages to force myself through. But in all there is something to learn from Jefferson, I'm not too sure that Grant had."
3,A fairly well written novel,"Ernest J Gaines' A LESSON BEFORE DYING, takes place during the late 40's, in a Cajun community within Louisiana. A LESSON BEFORE DYING is the story of a black teacher helping another black man on death row.The young teacher, Grant Wiggins, has moved back to the small town he had once called home to teach at the local school. After Grant's move back, the other young black man, Jefferson, is found guilty of a murder he took no part of. He is sentenced to death by the electric chair.A LESSON BEFORE DYING put a new idea in our head's about the rights of colored people in the 1940's. Grant Wiggins tells the story from a first person point of view.This book is well written, but is about a disturbing subject. It is hard to imagine the lives of some. We believe Ernest J. Gaines chose a good subject to write about.Alex Wallis Patrick Clarke Cassie Edwards"
4,One of the most down to earth books I've ever read.,A Lesson Before Dying is a wonderfully written book by Ernest Gaines. Having read this book to it's completion I feel confident in saying I give this novel 2 thumbs up.
5,"We need to find motifs or symbols on the ""hog"".",We are writing an analytical research paper on this book and we need some ideas please.
3,A powerful tale of hope and redemption.,"The reason I picked up this book was because it was an OPRAH pick. I held off reading it until I saw the movie version on HBO. The characters of Jefferson and Grant were almost mirror images of each other. Where one was ignorant, the other was smart. Where one was brave, the one was weak. They needed each other. The Lesson Before Dying could apply to the 2 of them. Each had a lesson to learn and it had to happen before the execution. Mr.Gaines' use of dialect and characterization added alot to the overall novel. The ladies in the novel were strong and helped their men grow as well. An excellent novel with powerful themes of hope and redemption."
4,Prejudice Kills!,"A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest Gaines shows a classic case of prejudice in that existed in southern states in the 1940s. For a young man to be classified as a hog, and shown no respect is a prime example of the ruthlessness. Jefferson did not have a fair trail. What ever happened to the United States law that states every man is innocent until proven guilty. The outstanding prejudice of the small Cajun town send a man who was not rightfully trailed to death. Who made us God, and how are they to try and do Gods' work. Prejudice is a bad discrimination among people that not only hurt others, but hurt ourselves. Prejudice divides communities, teaches children to hate, and weakens the economy. Ernest Gaines shows us through the townspeople that prejudice just makes things worst. Jefferson was not killed by his actions, but by the prejudice of the people."
4,Commentary on A Lesson Before Dying,"The book was very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in African American Culture in the 1940's. The part that interest me the most was when Jefferson's Nannan cooked a meal for him, and they got to sit down at the table and eat with Jefferson. At first Jefferson just stared at his plate and would not eat, because he was depressed. This made his nannan very sad. Grant pulled him to the side and had a talk with him,and he sat back down and began to eat his food. Thus, making his nannan happy after all there struggles."
3,The Ups & Down Points,In A Lesson Before Dying the story had its ups and down point that made you want to stop read and points that made you want to continue. I continued to read because I wanted to know was Reverend Ambrose and Grant going to agree on anything and get along with each other. Reverend Ambrose was not jealous of Grant to me but at some points in the book it seemed as if he were. He didn't want Grant to let his education interfere with Jefferson's salvation. It seemed as if Reverend Ambrose was trying to please more than just God but he wanted to please Miss Emma too.
3,Falls Flat,"I have heard over and over how good this book is. I have finally decided to read it, I am about 2/3 of the way through it, and I am not at all impressed. Maybe because this is not my first rodeo... I'm familiar with the theme, I've read many other works dealing with racial inequalities... For me, this one falls flat. I'm hoping ""the good part"" is in the last third."
3,An important story with a dull delivery,"This book is often compared with To Kill A Mockingbird. They both deliver lessons of the inherent injustice of racially defined societal hierarchies. The insecure obtuse nature of whites makes life a discouraging grind for blacks. This book delivers that message well. It also makes another point clear. Young black men with potential face a choice of staying local in a certain futility of trying to make a positive change or they escape and abandon their friends and family to another generation of discouragement. The point of the book is clear but that clarity is so direct that the book is rendered somewhat dull. Harper Lee delivers similar messages with the type of irony and lovable characters that are the artistic means of great story telling. Ernest J. Gaines delivers this story with a blunt hammer, hence my assessment of 'Important but dull'."
3,Not sure,"I read the book a couple of months ago and it left me confused. I understood the plot, but there were too many unanswered questions. Whatever happened with the girlfriend? Maybe the author didn't feel that was important. By reading some of the other reviews, I seen I'm not alone in my views of this book."
4,Changing of Emotions,"This book was a book that seemed to have lots of changes in the emotional state of the characters because of the fact the someone was going to die. The characters also had a lot of different views from eachother on how they should treat the person that was going to die for if they should speak to him about religion. I felt that this story can relate to a wide variety of different people. A lesson before dying a great book to read as a high school studen because it has many lessons in it, and it isn't just a boring book. It has a lot of excitement espcecially when it comes to some of the characters getting it fights."
2,Not in my interest,"This book was not the kind of reading I like to do for relaxing or for entertainment. It was very repetitive and boring. I did not like the main character doing the same thing every day, they could have added more interesting activities. This is the only book from Oprah's Book Club that I read and it turned me off to read any more of them."
2,Dissapointed,The product was described as used-good. If this is what the call good then id like to see what they call bad. There is dirt crusted all over the front cover. This will work for the intended purpose (summer reading) but if i wanted this as part of my collection i would greatly upset.
1,MOCKINGBIRD,"It was just like To Kill a Mockingbird, but with even less activity and more boredom. Overall, I only bought it because I didn't want to drag the book around..."
2,nothing gained,"A PC novel. With the exception of Jefferson, the characters are wooden. Nora Hurston and James Baldwin offer authentic and moving portrayals of African-American men and women struggling not only against a racist society, but also against their people to establish a true identity. I prefer the author's short stories."
2,Overrated,"This was a plodding novel with no engaging characters and lackluster writing. It is nowhere near the brilliance of Why the Caged Bird Sings, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Color Purple, Their Eyes Were Watching God, or any number of novels in the same genre. Somewhere along the line it must have become politically correct to praise this novel, and everyone has jumped on the bandwagon."
2,You'll Probably Read This In High School,"I was force fed this novel in 11th grade English. I won't go into the details of the story as they're written above, but there is one chapter that must be mentioned.The chapter titled ""Jefferson's Diary"" is the highlight of this novel. It is written without punctuation and with no grammatic consideration. This is where Gaines' ability to write shines through. This chapter is a much needed rest from the previous mundane chapters.I did not find the novel appealing in anyway. The protagonist is weak and annoying. The story drags on and on as Grant tries to help Jefferson mature out of his mental childhood. Metaphors and other literary techniques are present, but the novel is so boring that it's not even worth noticing them. The author's writing style is noteworthy, but again the slow pace and seemingly useless details overshadow the style. Don't pick it up unless you really need to, and if that's the case, get some kind of summary."
2,kind of boring book,"I bought this book for my son's Summer Reading assignment. Since I didn't read it, I have to go by what he thinks. My son is an avid reader but this book didn't get his interest very much. He said although it teaches a lesson, it's boring for him."
4,book,Wonderful book although almost identical to the lecture. A great read for everyone to help put things in perspective.
4,Gaines gives us a look at how unfairly blacks were treated.,"I haven't finished the book at this point, but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to finish it. This is the first book from Gaines that I have read and I'm sure that it will not be the last. I encourage everyone to read this book."
4,gave me a warm feeling in my innards,"This was a pretty powerfull book that seemed to take a new approach at some pretty old, yet still controversial sublect matter. Its not a book filled with explosive action (besides the first two pages), and its not fast moving. Yet the pages still move smoothly and hold the attention. The book takes a realistic approach at what its like to be on death row, and what its like to be wrongfully accused. How do you change a person who thinks they are nothing but a pig, fattening up for the slaughterhouse, into a man, and a representative of a race. This is the main problem discussed in the book. But the book has more to it than that. It shows the struggle that blacks had to go through not much more than fiftey years ago. It shows how they began to break free of the mold that they had been stuck in prviously, emerging as the great individuals that they always had been."
3,A novel about helping one's self by helping others.,"A Lesson Before Dying, is a compelling story of a boy who learns to live once he must die, and the teacher who aids him along his journey. The book not only focuses on the boy who is on death row, but also the conflicts his teacher deals with. Gaines does a nice job of setting up the characters so that the reader is able to feel their emotions along with the characters. The book takes place in a plantaion during the 1940's. The time period refelects greatly on the events of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to read an insperational text."
3,I found this book enjoyable,"For the most part, I found this book enjoyable. I believe it took a little on the long side to develop. The first twenty chapters or so I could barely keep my attention while I was reading it. This is opposed to the last 10 chapters or so when I could barely stand to put the book down. I love how the book explored the essence of being a man. I found it interesting how the book convinced me that both Jefferson and Grant made the magical transition from,in Jefferson's case, hog to man, or in Grant's case, grown child to man. The book left me with many thought provoking questions(which is a sure sign that the book is good)and the most dominating of these questions is what exactly are the components of a man?"
4,Lesson Before Dying is an imformative book. Read it!,"Fortunately, our senior A.P. English class got to read A Lesson Before Dying. I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was informative. It deals with the issue of captial punishment and other things as well. I did not know much about capital punishment yet, I aleady had the view of being for it. How could this be since I knew nothing about it? The book A Lesson Before Dying really made me think about my views. I definitely had a different attitude when I was finished with the book. The book entails many interesting characters that keep the book fun and amusing. The book really gets better as it goes on. Overall, I think this is an informative book that should be read by all. I gave it four stars, and a thumbs up!"
5,"Very moving, somber, opressing","This is a somber book. It makes me rethink the meaning of a teacher. And what will a teacher do if he is still in struggle? A convincing story indeed. But what I am dissatisfied with is that it ends suddently, leaving a lot of materials to be developed."
4,"slow to start, last chapter unforgettable","i had a difficult time getting through this book. i often questioned why it had made the Oprah book club list. alas, i moved forward and as a result was hardly prepared for the emotions that sprung forth from me as i read the last chapter...can someone say TISSUES! amazing! i recommend this book whole heartedly and hope others are as moved as i was."
4,A Lesson Before Reading.,"Though the Oprah Book Club seal on the cover, originally held me quite suspicious of this book's credibility, I actually found it a meaningful read. This story of a young man about to be killed for a crime he did not commit is one that surely leaves many people touched. I did not feel a strong emotional connection to the characters and found the plot a bit too predictable, but although it was hard to connect with the characters, they were (for the most part) very real and complex. I believe this novel is still too new to really find out whether it has lasting power and/or any great literary impact, but if you are looking for a fast-paced, meaningful (yet hard to connect with) read, I would reccomend this book."
1,The lesson: Oprah could sell a bicycle to a fish,"For readers looking for That Death Row Experience, check out ""Dead Man Walking"" instead. ""A Lesson Before Dying"" is a tedious exercise in racial pandering, repetitive not only in themes (Grant Wiggins, a black man who has escaped Massah and gotten a teaching certificate, encounters racism from Massah & co. at every turn while wondering ceaselessly whether to blow town and if so, whether to take his married girlfriend with him) but also in language (if I had a nickel for every time Grant called his girlfriend ""Honey"" in one memorable passage, I would be the new owner of the Redskins). The story plods along blindly until Jefferson, a mentally-challenged inmate who is supposed to learn said lesson, shows us his journal. From that point on, it's compelling and touching. Too bad that's not until the last chapter or so."
3,A book which gives us a lot of themes,"It's quite boring, especially for students. I had tried to stop reading it but at the end of the story , the situation changed and attract me to continue reading. The part that attract me the most should be the period of time before the black young person died. I could experience how sad was the author .Anyway, I recommend the senior high school students to read it ."
2,this book blows,A lesson before dying to me was not a very interesting book. My reasoning for saying that is because the book seemed slow. It was like they were trying to focus on one thing for i dont how many chapters. Some good things i liked about the book were the differences that it showed between the blacks and the whites. The book showed good explanation on how the young black children were educated and treated. In my opinion i thought thew book would have been better if it would have been a mystery of what boys were shot or who killed the boy. That would have kept me more interested then the way this story was told.
3,Book review for my english class :(,"Well, I thought this book wasn't great. I'm more of a dark fantasy kind of guy, y'know, vampires and other mischievious creatures of the night. I wasn't really too interested in what happened to a black man accused of murder in the 1940's and sentenced to death. I'm not gonna lie and say this book was great, because I didn't think it was. I did like the way that Gaines was able to capture emotions though, like when Jefferson felt like he should just give up and let the white men win or when Jefferson froze in the liqour store in the beginning. Overall, I'd say read this book if you were looking for insight into the way people were in the '40s, otherwise pass it by."
4,Heart wrenching but difficult language,"This book will really pull at your heartstrings but be prepared to do a little translating. The author writes in the dialect used by an uneducated person - so sometimes it was difficult to decipher what was being conveyed. That said, once you understand what is being conveyed, you can almost hear the words being spoken."
4,Very compelling,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""A Lesson Before Dying"" and there were a lot of things I could relate to from the stories my father told of growing up on a Louisiana plantation. The movie I saw about two years ago and cannot really remember it too well, but after reading the book I am going to rent it this weekend. The way Jefferson was potrayed as a hog instead of a human being and a man made it easier for the jury to find him guilty and sentence him to die. The rationale being is that it is okay to slaughter a hog, but to kill a man well that's another subject so instead of addressing Jefferson as a man lets make him into a hog. There were parts of this book that made me feel anger and other parts that gave me hope and promise. However, at the end Jefferson showed even though he was innocent of killing Grope he would take being at the wrong place at the wrong time as a man."
3,A Lesson Before Dying,"A Lesson Before Dying, written be Ernest J. Gaines, is a captivating story of how a stubborn and selfish teacher named Grant Wiggins and a diminished death row inmate, Jefferson, overcome adversity to form an everlasting friendship and prove to the world how African American men can stand tall in a world where they are oppressed and belittled. When Jefferson is called a ""hog"" during his murder trial, it starts a chain reaction which ends up the making and death of a friend. Grant must overcome his own personal roadblocks in order for him to reach and connect with Jefferson. The lack of action in the book is easily made up with the amount deep heartfelt emotions that the characters express. A wonderful book that everyone should read."
5,very very powerful book,"this book has emotions, powerful messages, and strong lesson. i think it's a very nice book for summer reading. it is very educational, and also gives us an arguable topic of slavery. i think it's worth reading."
2,Kind of boring from a 15 year old P.O.V,"From a 15 year old p.o.v., this book was boring and the plot was underdeveloped and it did not seem as though the author took a lot of time for details."
3,"The story is just a bit basic, but its not bad.","A Lesson Before Dying didn't hold my intrest, however it was well written. I think I've read too many stories and seen to many movies that deal with similar subject matter. Many of these stories and films did a better job of getting the message across also."
4,The magnificent ending is worth enduring the dull beginning!,"Overall, I would have to say A Lesson Before Dying is a wonderful book. It teaches lessons about love, family, life, death, and friends (just to name a few). I was quite skeptical at the beginning of the novel; it was dull, slow, and uninteresting. Luckily, I stuck with it and am glad I did so! Grant and Jefferson, characters within the novel, under went a change that is uncomprehendable. The book is remarkable simply by watching these two men rise to their full potential. I highly recommend every human being to read this striking novel. IT'S AWESOME!"
3,"Not bad, for required reading.","I was apprehensive when I started this book, and with good reason, I suppose. I was expecting it to be self-righteous and preachy (Oprah's seal of quality), and leave me feeling like a terrible human being, not even close to the level of the author. The first few chapters didn't offer much hope, either. But by the end, it had presented a well-written (though not groundbreaking) story of prejudice in 1940s Louisiana. The most effective passage in the book is Jefferson's diary, which could possibly stand alone as a short story (though I can't recommend doing that at this point). I will admit, after finishing it, my opinion of the book was much higher. I've little to complain about, though the author does have the nasty habit of repeating himself. Of course, if that bothers you, there's always the hope that a book on tape can bring."
2,I wasn't impressed,"I was decidedly ""meh"" about this book. I think it addresses several important issues -- the plight of young black men in the early 40s, the state of the justice system at the time, the usefulness of religion -- but I think those issues could have been addressed in a better way. The main character, Grant, is not particularly likable. He's bitter, unmotivated, and at times, just plain mean. In fact, most of the characters in the book are not particularly likable. Most of them appear to be downright miserable. A sign of the times? I don't know, but you'd think *someone* in the novel would be a joyful person. Jefferson, the imprisoned man, is an interesting character, but even his turn-around is a little anti-climatic. With the build-up of the novel and the title and the praise and all, I expected much more of an epiphany at the end. For me, the pay-off just wasn't there. If I hadn't been reading this for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it."
3,Gaines Tries But Doesn't Quite Do It,"A Lesson Before Dying is well-written and thoughtful. With that said I must interject and say it doesn't quite live up to expectations. Gaines seems almost fearful of tackeling serious issues. When Grant does reach Jefferson, the novel abruptly ends with his death, no great depth. Wiggins doesn't truly try at any one point to assist his imprisioned student so it was rather surprising to find he had reached him. How? By being cynical and cruel? If you want to read a thoughtful drama of African American life in the past, read the brilliant The Color Purple or if you want a compelling case of the unfair way blacks were persecuted in the South, read the compelling and worthwhile To Kill a Mockingbird. This is not near the poweress of Walker or Lee. Sorry Gaines, close but no cigar"
4,A Lesson Before Dying,"A book dealing with the problems of African-Americans in the 1950's, this book mainly concentrates on the life of a black man, Jefferson, sentenced to die and a friend, Grant, trying to make him realize his humanity. Though dealing with the problems of a specific minority, the book can easily be extended for all people in all minority groups. Though not all would have to deal with aspects like racism, they would have also have problems with oppression. Heroism and heroes or lack of them might be one of those problems. The life of the characters is awful and explicitly described by the author. Gaines's mostly simple and concise sentences show everything he wants to show and the rest is left up to the reader. This book is a book that traverses cultural boundaries, and can be applied to anyone and everyone. Overall however, though it tells of other things, the book tells about its own title: A lesson before dying."
4,A Lesson Before Dying,"This book was extremely enjoyable. It is very easy to follow and keeps you entertained. This book shows that no matter what position you may have in life you can always learn, sometimes from the most unexpected places. In this story Jefferson and Grant learned from each other. It also shows that in spite of skin color or situation you can come out above the rest. Jefferson portrayed this because even in his unfortunate state he rose above his situation and died with dignity. This book should be read by all for enjoyment and inspiration."
3,A Lesson Before Dying,"A Lesson Before Dying was a very touching and good book. The book had its moments where it was slow and I felt like the author could have done a better job in the way he presented the book. The message that was trying to be conveyed to the reader was good, but the pace at which it was moving was rather sluggish. At times, the characters were interesting and the book actually had my attention, but throughout the majority of the book, the characters were boring just like the book. I do recommend this book because of the message conveyed."
4,Interesting Book,"A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines begins with a young black man, wrongfully accused of murder, sentenced to death by an all white jury. Grant Wiggins, a local school teacher is sent by his aunt to teach the prisoner, Jefferson, to respect himself. Although Grant is reluctant, he begins to understand himself during this process.Gaines takes a look at racism and segregation in his novel. Grant feels confined by the small town he grew up in but his job options are limited, even though he is educated, because he is black. I think that on this level, Grant feels that he and Jefferson are similiar in that they are both imprisoned in some way. Jefferson helps Grant to realize that resistance and calmness in the face of fear can in some instances be the sign of a true hero. Both men gain mutual respect for one another and they learn the true definition of a hero.I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,An Astonshing Achievement,"Ernest Gaine's A Lesson Before Dying is an astonishing achievemetn in American literature. The reader benefits from so much from the reading of the novel. The novel is not only written exceptionaly, but it is very interesting and the reader finds himself forming a relationship with the characters. The novel shows the relationship between Whites and Blacks in the old South. On Grant's voyage to help Jefferson we learn about his heroes and his struggle with reality and fiction. A Lesson Before Dying is also a spiritually finding book. Gaines novel teaches the greatest lesson learned is not in academics but in the friends we make."
2,Audible Version Drastically Abridged,"We were very frustrated by the Audible version of this work. It is well performed and well read, but when they abridged the work, they really cut it. Sometimes 3 or 4 cuts within a single page of the original. It is very frustrating trying to follow along. I cannot recommend purchasing the Audible version of Lesson Before Dying."
4,"And indepth, deceivingly long story","I have to admit, this isn't the worst in-class reading assignment I've ever had to sit through. I probably wouldn't read it independently, as it simply isn't my genre of interest, but that doesn't mean I disliked reading it.The book is beautifully written. Ernest J. Gaines is a very descriptive author, with amazing character development. You really gain a wonderful understanding of the characters and their relationship with each other. It is also a great depiction of the time period it is based in, and has a perfect point of view from the african community during that time.However, the book often seems hard to follow. It's drawn out, and you may very well be half way through the book before you actually find the main point of the story. As such, I would most likely never have been able to finish it on my own. It isn't very engaging, although it does teach great lessons that everyone should learn."
3,Some Random Person's Dumb Review,"This is not a cheerful book, because it is about racism and someone being injustly excecuted, but for that very reason it is a good book to read (that, and it has nice, short chapters). It shows how bad racism can be and the problems we once had with it (and still have, to some degree). The main character, Grant, feels trapped in a society that still judges people by how dark their skin is. Another character, a white man who works at the jail, shows through his kindness to Grant that he is a good person, resisting society's pressure to conform to its racist ideas.I suggest that people read it to keep the lesson itself from dying."
3,Portrayal of racial issues during 1940's Louisana,"This book gave me a good understanding of the racial issues of the 1940's in Louisiana. The author included many faces of the issue: the blacks, the educated and the uneducated; mulattos; attitudes among blacks toward light skinned and dark skinned; the arrogant whites of that era and their wives (who played significant behind the scene roles); black family culture. It is all there and well written. I wish the author had written more about the friendship that developed between Grant and Jefferson. Otherwise, I liked the book and appreciated Gaines's portrayal of Jefferson."
2,Passable handling of subject matter done better elsewhere,"I was eager to read this book after reading rave reviews, but in the end was disappointed with the author's fragmented story-lines and character development which too often dead ended before satisfying my curiosity. I appreciated the authors insights and development of intra-racial issues between Grant, Jefferson, Vivian and the other inhabitants of the plantation. Jefferson's diary and Paul's visit to the school house are powerful images that are well told by the author. Overall, however, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" far out shines this book's handling of the subject matter -- and it was told from a white perspective. Nice try, but no cigar."
4,Is there more to this story than what's in the book?,"This is an engaging read and touches on some important issues, but it doesn't quite address any of them definitively. I found myself fascinated by the main characters. I always wanted to know what was going to happen and that kept me turning the pages. However, I was never convinced that the characters Jefferson and Grant were really connecting as much as Grant believed they were. Grant's romantic interest with Vivian gave an interesting human dimension to the story but never seemed an integral part of the main story. In short, I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but always wanted more information than was forthcoming. Perhaps that's realism."
4,I was transported to the scene!,"Ernest Gaines did a terrific job with bringing the reader to the scene and feeling the plantation life. I found I wanted more exploration of the characters, especially his aunt and his girlfriend. What about a more definite redemption at the end for Grant? I was left wanting more. I learned a lot about things that I had thought weren't occurring in the 1940's which was very thought provoking. Over all a good book, but not a masterpiece."
4,"A story that makes you think, even after you are done.","Grant Wiggins task of fulfilling a wish from his aunt has us all battling with the issue on how to face a man who has been sentenced to death. The struggle that Grant Wiggins endures and the empact that this task has on his life is one that makes the reader think about if such a request was placed upon themself.Being an African-American in the south is no easy life and Ernest Gaines has kept his book true to the period. The human emotion displayed though out is very real, especially Jefferson's diary.Reading ""A Lesson Before Dying"" is also a lesson about human-kind. For we are all humans no matter what our station in life may be."
3,Puzzling.,"First, let me say this was a good book. I love a hero who is burned out and a heroine who looks for the good in people. But...I found myself constantly looking at the author's name to verify that it said Jayne Ann Krentz on the cover. There was none of her signature humor or crackling sexual tension. As it has a 1999 copyright date, I would expect her usual style. Could this be a much older book that wasn't published until 1999? If you're a JAK fan, you might be disappointed. If you like sweet romance with a little sex and interesting minor characters, this is the book for you."
3,Review on PRIVATE EYE,"This book was okay but it didn't sizzle by any stretch of the imagination. While the plot was fine, the telling of it was only moderately good. Josh was a cool guy, however."
4,couldn't put it down,"This was my first Lori Foster book. I loved every minute of it. After reading it I went out and bought four other Lori Foster books. I like authors who don't portray the hero as a wimpy romantic. Her male characters are more masculine, while still being romantic. I happen to have three older brothers, me being the only girl in the family, so I can also say I like her female characters better, because they are not all wishy washy. I also love finding authors who are as good with the secondary characters as the main characters, and she definitely fills that bill. Keep Writting Lori!"
1,Don't buy this!,"This book has nothing to do with branding....You'd be better off buying a texbook about basic economics, because this is what this book deals with."
1,Do not buy!!!!,"I bought this part and installed it on my daughters car. Nine months later the upper fitting exploded while she was away at college. Fifty dollars for a tow and 150 dollars for the repair at a local shop with what turns out to be the same 5 dollar part. When this one explodes, I will buy the original and not think twice about it."

2,Weekly Vista Columns,"The book is a compilation of articles written by Marilois Bach for the Weekly Vista Newpaper in Bella Vista, Arkansas."
5,Key Text For Initiates,"I was introduced to this book 18 months ago as I began a four-year Marig Munsel class at Tashi Choling on Mount Ashland. It served as our introductory text, and I've read it cover to cover at least three times. It is most thorough and accessible. I appreciate how topics are introduced, defined, then illustrated with numerous clear examples. Glossary material and appendices are especially impressive. Often the text reads like religious or found poetry, which I find especially appealing and endearing. But my greatest compliment for this text is the simple acknowledgement that my personal spiritual practice took shape and deepened considerably as a result of reading and re-reading and referring to this text.I highly recommend it for any serious-minded spiritual student, not just those interested in Tibetan Buddhism.--Robert McDowell, author of the forthcoming Poetry In Spiritual Practice"
3,Rocio Siempre DVD,"My wife is from Spain, watched this. She said it was her last concert and you could tell she was sick with the cancer. She was trying to do what she did best, but it was lacking. Others may like it."
3,They are ok,"They are ok if you are going to use them with a regular toothbrush, but I was really looking for something to cover my electric toothbrush. I am having such a hard time finding covers for it."
2,Adequate,"These covers are OK, but they're a pretty snug fig for my toothbrush. That means I have to shove the brush in, and I worry about that. I wish they still made the covers that had a hinged top. They fit much better.However, this is better than having the toothbrush exposed to my cat, who likes to sniff it and rub up against it. Ugh!"
5,Buy It Now,"The Flocabulary workbook is just great. I've improved 50 points on the critical reading on the SAT. I learned 500 new words too. One would think the songs would sound weird but they have real hip hop beats, the rapper sounds authentic and catchy tunes. I learned 50 words a day, EASILY. I found some songs stuck in my head and would sing them in the shower."
5,GREAT SAT PREP!,"Great SAT prep!! What a unique, original concept for vocabulary-building skills! It's not only fun, it's remarkably effective! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a FUN way to prep for the SATs... or for anyone who wants to build her vocabulary!"
4,"Great taste,, but you'll need more than the instructions suggest","I LOVE white chocolate mocha, and I was thrilled to find the sugar free variety. Be aware that you will need more than the suggested two tablespoons if you have made yourself a medium sized latte. It took four tablespoons to finally get the flavor I wanted. It's not exactly the same taste as you will get at a local coffee house, but it's very close and it's sugar free. Because of the amount you will need to flavor your coffee, a six pack is definitely not overkill. I've rated this four stars because it takes so much to flavor the coffee to the level that I'm used to.Be aware that this is sugar free, but it is NOT low calorie. A two tablespoon single serving is 80 calories."
3,"Good training, but not for power.","I've used this system for training and find it useful, however, when kicking with force I have broken the metal connections that let the pads flex and bend. replacement are not cheap."
4,Very Handy,"Pour in your oil and then screw the cap on, keep screwing until you hear a slight ""snap"" and the dropper insert is in place. This works fine for cinnamon oil. I struggle to get it to release drops of Vitamin E oil though. Probably has to do with viscosity of the oil, if you want to use this in mass, you should probably try to find out what viscosity it is designed for."
3,Caps tamperred with,"First, it looks like the price has gone up. I purchased 2 dozen at $4.45/doz just a couple weeks ago. Second, when I received my order I found that some of the bottle caps had been already screwed on all the way. Meaning I had to break the seal and pry out the dropper cap in order to fill with my product. I was confused as to why some of the caps were screwd on in this manner, and others were left off, allowing the seal to remain unbroken when I placed the caps on myself. (The only one who should be breaking the seal is the customer.) All in all, the product is decent. Good size, doesn't leak, and perfect for distributing essential oils. But having the caps be tampered with is a big ""No-NO""."
5,excellent,Fringe is the greatest show I have ever seen. I started late to so I got to watch season 1 to 4 on prime free no commercials. Greatest show ever.
5,Will really miss this show!!,"I've watched all five seasons and have become invested in the characters, Walter Bishop in particular. Very good, fast-paced smart drama. The human characters were 3-dimensional and viewers found themselves emotionally attached to them, which I guess is one sign of a great series. I also enjoyed the scientific explanations for new gadgets in the future -- great characters, great actors, great emotional depth. I loved this very well-written series."
5,So sad it is over,"I loved this series! It was great fun and entertaining. Walter is one of the TV great characters of all time. Is it perfect and free of plot holes? No, but it was still fun and a big thumbs up for Sci Fi folks."
5,I love Fringe,I just wish it didn't take so long to download episodes after purchasing. I don't care to watch them online because of the pauses and freezing of the vids. I have broadband but it's apparently NOT broad enough!
4,Whats up with new episodes?,"Hum.. did I miss something here? I understand this is the last ""SEASON"" but surly this was not the last episode. No new episodes for the last two weeks. I can't stand waiting much longer.Anyone have more info?Robin CV"
4,A little crazy but still great,"They come up with some really crazy things in this show. I'm usually not a sci-fi fan. But I love this show and absolutely love ""Walter"" He's my favorite character :)"
5,Fringe keeps getting better,"I am very sad this show is in it's last season. It's my favorite. I look forward to seeing it every friday night, when I can't watch it, I can also buy the episode I missed on Amazon."
4,Excellent end to a new classic sci-fi series,"Has JJ Abrams finally mastered the art of the finale? This was a great wrap up to my favorite how of the last several years. Emotionally satisfying, packed a lot of action and thrill into a story that mostly stayed true to the characters' core selves."
3,Losing Its Edge,"I enjoy Fringe still, but I am not as deeply engrossed in the story line as I was with the prior 2 alternate universe struggles and alternate timelines."
4,Great last season,This show was a phenomenally original sic-fi series. It was a bit predictable at times but that is kind of why I liked it. The only reason this season doesn't get 5 stars is because Olivia's character showed no development throughout the series. This could be said of most characters on this show but it especially fits her. Fringe is original and entertaining.
4,Good but not great,"I really enjoyed the Fringe series, but Season 5 kind of strayed from the show's original premise. Having the observers go from a side story to morphing into evil aliens whose intent was to take over the world seems silly. Seemed like the writers ran out of new ideas and settled on the easy way to wrap it up. The writing is tight, the characters are compelling, but I'm just not buying the final plot twist."
4,A little disappointing,"It seems as if the last episodes are dedicated to checking off items from a grocery list.Magnet, Check. Rocks from a mine, Check. Bald headed boy, Check.Kill of the daughter that was prettier than her Mom, Check.I keep holding out for a few good episodes."
2,An extra season that was pretty mediocre,I personally believe the series would have been better without the last season. This didn't add much to the show. If you really loved the show (and I didn't love it) then you may like this season.
1,fringe season 5,"If you loved seasons 1-4, don't ruin it by watching Fringe Season 5. All the parts are stupid and boring."
1,very misl,On the tv it says the complete 5th season. Noticed it was only 1 episode. Had to go to two places to finally see it was only one episode. Who would pay a $1.99 an episode when you can go another on demand service and get all episodes for 1.99. It was very misleading.
1,Too short.,"Not enough episodes! Left me with more questions than answers. Go figure. I guess that is the nature of the beast, come on ...what was it 4 or 5 episodes."
5,great season,love this show. great not to have the comercials. nice to be alble to watch them over and over again
5,Great Season!,Can't get enough of Walter! The whole cast does an excellent job as the story moves into the future. Awesome!
4,Sorry to see it end,I loved this series. So different from anything else on TV. Season 5 was very different from the previous seasons but it was perfect the way the writers tied everything together in the last few episodes into a nice bow!
2,Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.,"J.J. Abrams should have quit while he was ahead. Season Four would have made a perfect series finale and would have ended what had been an amazing show on a very high note. Season Five shames the name of Fringe.SPOILER ALERT:Did you live for those episodes with the alternate universe? Did you fall in love with the characters alter-egos? Were you waiting with baited breath to see if David Robert Jones would actually destroy both universes? Did you have those ""Ah-Hah!"" moments where past events suddenly took on new meaning with each new twist in turn in the ever-developing plot?Me too.Well sorry, Fringe fans. All of that is gone in Season Five. Welcome to a dark future timeline where the observers are the bad guys and all of the Fringe characters are losing every last shred of integrity and nobility they once had. Way to kill our dreams, Abrams."
5,Addicted,"I spent my holiday break getting addicted to Fringe (thank you Amazon Prime!) only to find out that this is its last season. Just when I found what a great show I've been missing too. It's like the X-files but without the aliens, though I'm still not sure about the observers. The storyline should explain it all when it comes back in February for the last few shows. Fringe really filled that void that I've had since Heroes and Alcatraz were cancelled. It must have been a victim of poor scheduling because it really is a great show with lots of unexpected twists. Oh well, maybe the SciFi channel will pick it up. Fingers crossed!"
5,"I hate to see it end, but it was a good ending","Great show from the beginning, but this season put some real creativity into the mix. My only complaint is that its over."
5,Fantastic!,"Great series!I wish some one finds a way to write more seasons but as they say, ""All good this must come to an end"""
4,Love Fringe wish it were not ending.,The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I have not seen the last 2 episodes but I am sure the rating will be a 5 star once I have seen them. The series ended too soon for me. Would be cool if the 5 main stars could have a spin off where they work independantly of the Government.
4,Addictive fictional science,I started watching fringe a few months ago and usually watch a couple episodes per day. This season is the most entertaining but I think the back-story adds quite a bit of enjoyment to it.
5,couldn't have been better,"Having never bothered to write any reviews as there is little that is worthy, I felt strongly that this series deserved praise and my one and only review. Fringe is perfect sci-fi; intriguing, entertaining, emotionally engaging, well written and directed, and marvelously acted. It is the most unique and best series I have ever seen."
3,Contrived,"Fringe, like X-Files has painted itself into a soap opera corner. I enjoyed the non ""continuing story"" episodes in both series. The writing in their soap opera aspect became increasingly contrived presumably in order to tie together diverse loose ends. This is especially true of the final season 5 of Fringe."
5,great last season,Sad. To see it end at least fox let them have one last season to wrap it up unlike other shows.
5,Sci fi at its finest.,This is the greatest sci fi series ever. I have watched all five seasons and feel like I know the characters. I am going to really miss it. The fifth season was quite different from the other four but still just as good.
5,Fringe is bad ass,"Goodness on the small screen, watch it. Walter is the man, love his enthusiasm for psychotropic drugs, pot, and red vines."
5,Fringe,Actually this review applies to all five seasons: the best sci-fi show ever made for TV. It has the depth and maturity of a good novel.
5,Love It,"While we have been avid Fringe fans since being turned on to it by family, we are sad that it will soon come to an end. In this final season, so far Olivia's character seems to have changed. I think I liked her better when she was the FBI agent. Now that their daughter is dead the story seems to be lagging a bit. But we still like it very much."
2,What happened to the writers????,"The seasons leading up to this were phenomenal....interesting, thought-provoking, everything you want in a sci-fi show. This was just sad. Everything that made it fantastic in the past definitely was lost."
3,Fringe final,"Not as much fun as the earlier seasons, but a satisfying ending to a series that at it's heart is a rumination on fatherhood."

2,okay,"Fringe seems to be getting lost in its own storyline. getting harder to follow with interest - too many nonsensical or contradictory things/events, etc... and even the believability of the characters is losing something"
2,Fringe is falling apart,Very dark - think the show is now riding the shark. Wish the the powers to be would stop playing classic rock to fill holes in failing script.
2,Great episode but not in HD,"I paid for HD and got Standard Definition. Great episode, but I am not impressed with Amazon's HD capability. If you are a fan of the show, you must see this episode! However, I would consider another source to do so."
2,Traveling back in time to get some Poon,"Ive only seen the 1st episode of season 5, and so far I find the whole premise just to silly. Hopefully over a few episodes it will grow on me. But as of right now Im not keen as to how they are handling the ""Observers"" For such an advanced race, they motives seem contrived and petty."
2,I think the writers for season one through four were erased from our timeline. Season really ends at Season 4.,Makes the first 4 seasons nearly irrelevant. Storylines from other seasons evaporate...Nothing like the first four seasons. I wish we stopped watching at the end of season four. We were hoping it would pick-up the storylines from the first four seasons but it didn't.
2,Goodbye Fringe,"How sad. They turned Fringe into a dull invader story. Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia, Walter, and Peter to make some incredible discovery. Walter is no longer the lovable damaged person he was, and that was 80% of the draw of the series. I had pre-purchased a season pass but I am now canceling it. For me the series is already over."
1,Complete misfire,"In the grand tradition of Lost, Fringe's producers abandoned their core audience and went against virtually everything else they'd carefully set up (story- and legend-wise) in the first 4 seasons to create a ridiculously sub-standard storyline, which could be subtitled ""The Search for Walter's Tapes."" What had been an amazingly eloquent and virile 4-year run ended with the thud of this disastrous season. Forgive me for pulling a Pam Ewing, but I'm going to consider this entire 5th season a dream (nightmare, really) and stick with seasons 1 through 4 and never speak of this terrible calamity (and total slap to the Fringe faithful) again. BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Not Walter,"Although I enjoyed the entire series to date, the fifth season, as you would expect brings more tension and excitement as fulfilling Walters plan to defeat the Observers becomes the main focus."
4,"""One of the best new blues records out today""","This record is not a surprise to all of James's and all blues fans!! Will all know that James is one of the best doing what he does. This record brings out what James does in his live show. Kid Ramos does his thing on ""Read My Mind"". The record sound is awsome.. The engineering so well done. Jerry Hall Always does his job. If You Like This Record check out the new release distributed on Hepcat Records. Mannie & The Swingin'Hipshakers, which also has Kid Ramos, Lynwood Slim,Jerry Hall and Otis Grand all as special guests....Big Art Mak"
3,leaves an after taste,"leaves a nasty after taste, I take these when I go to bed -can't taste it in my sleep! My husband prefers the gummy vitafusion calcium, so I am eating these since I won't waste them like he will!"
5,A Must-Read For Kids or Adult Lizard Lovers,"The new series of Godzilla paperbacks are finely written by Marc Cerasini. This book has the action to keep a younger reader glued to his seat, and the ability to do the same to an adult. A must read for all Godzilla fans."
3,"Eh, it was good, but not great.","I liked how Godzilla and Varan were done, but the other monsters only get one scene. Marc wrote about too many monsters to make them all interesting enough. Godzilla only fights one monster in the book and that fight is only three chapters long. Plus there are too many different plots going on to make any of them good, and is hard to keep track of them all. I'd buy it, but wouldn't get upset if they were out of stock."
4,Way cool.,The G-force is in this one. Rodan has it`s first baby. I don`t like Rodan having babys. Mothra was in this one. He helped Godzilla fight King Ghidorah. One of the best Godzilla books. I want Toho to make movies out of Cerasini`s books. 4 stars.
4,great book,this is a great godzilla book its not the best of the brilliantly written godzilla series by marc cerasini but it is fun and exciting highly recommened
4,A good book for Godzilla fans,"It's not the best but still it was pretty good. I think Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla At Worlds End are better because I like books with a lot of monsters. Still, I really liked it alot!"
5,Simply The Best!,"As this being the first Godzilla book I have read in the new series, I would have to say this one is simply the best! Cerasini gives you a feel of being there and portrays Godzilla as an animal, a force of nature, where in some movies he is portrayed as a beast, a force of destruction. Godzilla 2000 is a great read for Godzilla Fans everywhere."
4,A must-read for fans of the Big G!,"Both new and old Godzilla fans will enjoy this exciting, fast paced novel detailing the monster's return to Tokyo, forty years after his last appearance. By creating an original sequel to the 1954 film, Cerasini is able to introduce Godzilla to new readers who might only know Godzilla by reputation, without having to recap the entire movie series. Hard-core fans who might be upset that this book and its sequels ignore the events on the big screen will be pleased at how thoroughly Cerasini has captured the spirit at the heart of the Godzilla stories. While this novel and the ones that follow are written for a teen audience -- and feature young adult protagonists as a result -- adults will find them just as entertaining. If Tom Clancy featured giant monsters in his books, they still wouldn't be this good! Check it out!"
2,"As asteroids come towad Earth, Godzilla, Rodan and morefight","I rate this book a 2 beacause the monsters were boring and less detailed then Mark Cerasini's third book, Godzilla at World's End. Also, this Kip Daniels goes to G-Force just because he beat a video-game?"
2,BAD BAD BAD!,"I loved godzilla returns and was hopeing to see some good fighting scenes in this one, nick gordon and brian shumara (from the first book) only go cameo apperences and that was the first(of many) problems with this book. nick and brian sould have been the stars in this book, but they got the un-likeible, g-force now, and this tradision of kicking out stars continued with ""godzilla at worlds end"" . and the part where the girl can ""mentaly"" hear mothra, that stinks! so if you like GOOD books, then DONT get this one."
3,A bucket in a bucket,"First...these seat covers (I got two) look really good in real-life (always a little concern buying based on a picture). They went on easily and stayed in place reasonably well. However, I bought them for a smaller car with bucket seats and when I got in I found that the little flaps on the sides were pushed up so high that the only flat seat left was the blue strip in the middle. I'm not a fat man but I'm not a skinny teenage girl either (for whom these would no doubt be great) so I was pushed up a little and kind of had the feeling of sitting on a comode. I ended up putting them in a larger car which didn't eliminate the problem but did reduce it. Bottom line: Very soft and cozy and I liked the lumbar support but didn't work in a small car."
4,"Beautiful decanter, just a little too big","Our V & B decanter came in very attractive and safe packaging. It's a nice show piece, just a little too big - it kind of overwhelmes the other items on our liquor table. It would work well in a larger space or dedicated bar area. We've kept our port in this decanter for many weeks and it still tastes great."
3,Packet Alley,Packet Alley by Elizabeth Meg was a great book to read to 4th graders during our study of Delaware state history. The premise of magic glasses allowing the main characters to see historic events always kept the students interested. And learning that famous people traveled through Delaware helped them to gain an appreciation of Delaware's location and importance in the nation's growth.
3,"Interesting premise and characters, but not up to Terry's high standard","I've been a Terry Bisson fan for a very long time. Each and every story he writes has something very unique to the voice and to the plot. This holds true for this novel as well, but, I fear I have been spoiled by Terry's excellent short story collections. From any other author this novel would probably constitute a great accomplishment in style, tone, character development, and plot, but as a Terry Bisson novel, I was left wanting more.The premise is, as always, unique and promising, but I can't help but feel it would have worked better as a short story rather than a novel."
3,Great premise - not-so-great delivery...,"What a great premise - set in the nearish dystopian future, a ""Pickup Artist"" responsible for collecting artistic works that have been identified for deletion from the canon (because newer artists found it too hard to become successful/popular) becomes disenchanted with his life and job and rebels (in his own unique and somewhat unintentional way). Echoes ofFahrenheit 451combined with dry wit in the first few pages made this seem like a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, the promise of the premise was never exactly realized. The story fell vaguely flat somehow - I am still not sure exactly where it went south, but just know that somewhere in the middle I realized I no longer cared what happened. Occasional witty bursts of prose combined with the premise kept me reading through to the end, but the story never quite seemed to live up to its potential - and more's the pity, because I really did love the concept."
5,The definitive work of witchcraft & demonology!,"This is a textbook of witchcraft and demonology written by the Catholic priest that found the need to translate the ""Malleus Maleficarum"" (the professional manual for witch hunters for nearly three centuries) into modern English. This was written prior to the modern Wiccan movement and discusses the horrors of sorcery and pacts with the devil. If you are looking for the definitive non-fiction work on the evils of witchcraft and demonology then, you have found it. If you are looking for a book promoting bunny-fluff Wiccan friendship magic, you're in over your head here."
3,Tough read,"Well I didn't paticularly like the way it was written (obviously because of when it was written) but I did find the accounts of exorcism, ""fake"" exorcism's, diabolic/demonic possesion, etc.. interesting in most cases. However, I didn't agree with his rather intense view (compared to the rest of the book) on spirtism. Also, the chapters' ""The witch in holy writ"" and ""The witch in dramatic literature"" were not chapters I found of great interest. This book is best for being a collection of examples of accounts with devils and demons."
3,"To Be Informed, Not Swayed","5 stars if you're planning to make a hollywood horror movie; you'll be swarming in dubious info, perfect for any imaginary work. -1 star for taking every thrown-at anecdote as proof enough, as if the phobia of all (so-called) secular beliefs after the beginning of the world's christianising would not result in as many fictional beliefs and false histories as that which secular cultures heathenishly accept. -1 more stars because 4 points is too high a grade.However, there may be some truth to what he says. How widespread these practices were, and whether they were at all related to a diabolic entity from Christiandom is another matter.It must also be noted that present-day Witchcraft (Wicca) and Satanism (Church of Satan) are mostly harmless institutions: they do not eat pies made from human babies and exhumed corpses. There are practically no police records of any virgins being napped off for sacrifice at some altar or other. None to worry there. Nor prejudice."
2,Only a few songs are great,"It isn't as good as I thought. I have listened a pair of songs and it sounded country, but the rest of the cd sounds very repeated, and he has a too linear voice that is boring. Take your opinion."
1,Tapas:,When we traveled in Spain we discovered many different Tappas that everyone liked! I felt that these recipes required ingredients that we cannot buy in Indiana. Big cities on each coast might have squid and octapus ready to go but we do not. Not very many recipes appealed to us. Thank you. C.S.
2,"ESPERABA MAS DEL LIBRO, IT'S OK BUT...","I REALLY WANTED TO RECEIVE A MORE TRADITIONAL CONTENT ABOUT TAPAS, THERE'S A GOOD CONTENT BUT POOR ABOUT TRADITIONAL TAPAS FROM SPAIN, IT'S MORE LIKE A ""FUSION CUISINE"". THE PICTURES AND MATERIAL OF THE BOOK IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY."
3,Mild stool softener...,"If you just have a mild constipation this will work for you. For me was different...after giving birth the constipation was a nightmare and the only product that worked is Phillips Laxative Caplets, 2 at night with NO cramps. Good luck!!"
5,non-laxative stool softener,"This is an specailly effective for treatment of IBS constipation problems. Because it is not a laxative, It may be taken every day as needed."
5,Fabulous!,I have read the entire series. I was hooked by the end of book one and now that I've finished them all I don't know what to do with myself! I have become part of the family. I think the writing is outstanding and the characters extremely intriguing. You can't help but feel their pains and joys right along with them. Mr. Sarabande's books are a delight to get lost in.
1,"Incest, Rape, Murder, Pedophilia","This book depicts people at their worst. While it could have been an interesting read about early American hunters and gatherers, the horrific details of rape, incest, pedophilia, and murder just got worse and worse. I began to wonder what the author's purpose was in writing this book. It seemed as though the book was just a venue for writing about pedophelia, which he discusses in great and endless detail."
4,THE BEST ONE SINCE TORKA!,"This was one of the best stories since the very 1st one. She is a master storyteller in this one, a must read!"
5,Excellent,"It 'a good product, a good fragrance.This after shave gives skin feeling fresh and smoothness.It is not a product strong onto the skin.What about Amazon:Lots of seriousness did not ever found.Accuracy on the date of delivery (eg I was confirmed as the date of delivery and in the same 06/06/08 I received the product.Very good channel for purchasesLet Council."
1,CHRISTIAN BOOK! BEWARE!,"This starts out as a great book, but has a clear christian agenda. Amazon needs to clearly identify this book as a christian book."
4,Important missing information...,This book is a Christian book with references to Jesus. People of other beliefs will probably not be interested in this book.
1,beware,"I would not have bought this book if I had read the reviews first & realized it's a Christian book. And to be honest it starts out good but when it gets to ""Mama stoops to kiss my hand. She tells me JESUS UNDERSTANDS He left his house and his room too, so he could go to someplace new"" I was a little uneasy. I'm not a Christian but I think it's a little weird to be comparing our families move to Jesus's death."
4,A great way to talk with your child about moving.,"I started reading this to my son about 2 months before we moved. He is still very young, but I think it might have helped to ease the transition for him. For older children it could be a great way to get them talking about an upcoming move."
5,Julie,Delightful movie. Johnny Messner as the Doctor was convincing in his role. You never know how the movie is going to end-even though you know how these movies end-until it does.
2,artistic and commercial disappointment,"The Beau Brummels' first album for Warner Brothers was a major artistic and commercial disappointment. Warner Brothers asked the group to record a cover album of the hits of day, although the record company had acquired the Brummels' complete recorded output - released and unreleased - after Autumn faltered. There was enough original material recorded that would have filled an excellent third album.My advise for completists: Buy it when you already have everything else."
2,Never should of made a cover album,"I loved the Beau Brummels on the radio and on TV. Laugh Laugh on SHINDIG, Don't Talk to Strangers on WHERE THE ACTION IS. I remember spending hours listening to INTRODUCING AND VOL 2 and then this came out. No longer on a small label they were now on Warner Brothers. Big deal , this is a terrible memory of a record. I think I played it twice and never want to hear it again. With all the song writing ability from Ron Elliot AND Sal Valentino they make them record covers? YEAH and George Martin wanted the Beatles to record How Do You Do It instead of Please Please Me."
1,low quality product,Low quality product. Oil cooler fittings leak. Fan screw to short to be use. Hit are condition expansion tank. Do not buy!!!
5,"Thrilling, suspenseful novel","This novel draws the reader into the novel with well developed characters and a quickly moving plot line that surprises and entices. I was unable to put the book down until finished and when finished, I read it again to focus on the characters and details I may have missed with the first read."
5,Great Front Image And The Contents Are Not So Bad Either !,"Just Blue was released in 1978, the previous year had seen Magic Fly and Deliverence.While this one may have just failed to maintain the standards of the aformentioned it does enough for me to earn 5 stars.The vocal tracks, Save Your Love For me and My Love Is Music aren't really the finest, but the remainder are excellent European electronic disco type sounds which I enjoy.Best track is Symphony, Space only went on to make one more album, from 1980 Deeper Zone."
4,Actually Pretty Good,"Surprisingly enough, this is actually a pretty good album. If you were into Counting Crows, you'd probably like it. Ironically, I may actually be the first person ever to buy a retail copy of this album. I used to work for Steve Kall, the clown that these guys were pulling returns scams with. We ordered one box, and I bought a copy before street date. We eventually returned the other 29 copies--never sold a single one. The indie buyer at Pac Coast really liked it too; he must have played his promo copy at least 15 times."
2,"Poor graphics, imcomplete info.","Many shots in this book lack interesting features and are there just to fill space. Also many images are blury and it does not even tell anything about the movie soundtrack, which I know inclues excellent songs by Apollo440 and a joint venture by Juno Reactor and The Creatures."
2,weak plot and characters,"I give the author cudos for delving into old historic records but gathering facts does not make a book. I read for both pleasure and knowledge and found no pleasure in reading this book; in fact I got frustrated and annoyed. I truly wanted to like the book. The facts have potential but it seemed the author didn't know where she wanted to go with the book. The story line was simplistic, old, worn and weak. The characters were poorly developed and the plot old. Who in the world doesn't know that women had few rights in early New England?"
5,Intrigueing new story line with compelling characters,"I am not usually particularly drawn to historical fiction, but my book club chose this book and I really enjoyed it. Sally Grunning does a great job of making the characters complex, and leaving some of these complexities for the reader to interpret. I enjoyed this chance to try and imagine what each character was thinking and what the back story might have been. The pacing of the story was right on target, and I found myself wanting to pick it up whenever I had a minute. I will definitely read more by this author."
4,Fascinating glimpse at 18th century Colonial life,"After twenty years of marriage to a whaler, Lyddie Berry suddenly finds herself a widow when Edward is drowned at sea.Despite having spent long periods of time alone during Edward's trips, Lyddie suddenly finds her life turned upside down as her husband's will and the customs of the day seize her house from her. Lyddie is now under the thumb of her nearest male relative - her daughter Mehitable's husband Nathan - and his greed.While willing to at least try going along with what's expected of her initially, Lyddie soon balks at the changes in her life. She refuses to sign away her home ownership, and causes an uproar in her Massachusetts village.Gunning creates believable characters amidst painstaking detail to the historic period for a fascinating read."
3,Quick Read,"Quick read. If you want something light with interesting enough plot line, then this book will do the trick. Reads like a Hallmark channel or Lifetime story set in Colonial times."
4,Enjoyed this,"This is the kind of book that will make you appreciate your wonderful home, plenty of food, and easy life.I found it interesting and insightful, although I don't think believe the physical relationship in the book would be historically accurate. Still a good read."
4,The Widow's War,"An excellent novel, based on historical facts of pre-revolution America.This novel revolves about the lack of rights afforded to women of this period under English Law. When widowed, a woman was allowed the value of one-third of the estate of her husband. The other two-thirds went to the closest male relative, who became responsible for the widow.In this story, the widow's home, livestock and property came under the control of a selfish son-in-law. As the story unfolds, with the help of a caring lawyer, she tries to devise a method to live in her own home rather than having to live with an unkind son-in-law."
3,Interesting but Dated,"Perhaps because this book was so influential, a lot of what he says are now common sense. It's a good read and very amusing. Makes you want to bring in a bunch of animals to live with you so you can observe their behavior."
1,STILL HAVENT RECEIVED ANYTHING,About a month ago I ordered the book and I still haven't received anhything. I do not know how to get my money back now or when it will arrive... Help!
1,Dishonesty,"This product was purposely advertised under edition 11 while it is in actuality a 7th edition. Not only that, it is not even cost accounting but Financial accounting. To make matters worst the seller was not helpful at all and blamed everything on Amazon. I am doing my second masters and therefore not new to Amazon; so blaming such an institution is no justification for an inherent dishonesty. There was no CD package as well and therefore the only thing that matched to the discreption was the authors. Proof of this persons dishonesty is that on Amazon you can buy the same book he sold me at $2 while he sold (cheated) the book to me for $20 something. I strongly advise no one to buy from this person. If there was any lower rating than 1 I would definetly have given him that as rating ""1"" is too high of a scale for this persona."
1,Unhappy,"The product has not arrived. I received an e-mail stating that it should arrive 9/22 or 9/23. As of 9/25, it has not arrived."
1,i wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all,i've never seen such a poor book before. it is poor organized. and i got after 25 days from my order date.
1,ink won't flow,This is such a fun and creative kit that my 10 and 13-year old sons would be crazy about if the small ink pens come with the book would flow. It is very bothering that only 3-4 ink pens out of 20 (therefore the colors are limited) were able to flow without clogging. We were totally frustrated.
1,Would not recommend,"This product would be very nice, except for the fact that all the ink was completely dried out upon opening the package."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought several items looking to get something similar to the old spirograph, which I could never do as a kid. Guess what, still can't!"
5,Fascinating and wonderfully entertaining,"What a lovely overwiew of Celtic culture. The author alternates between short, intriguing essays on Celtic society and traditions, and actual Celtic stories. The ballance is perfect. The reader is given just enough background to understand each story. By the end of the book, though, a detailed impression of these remarkable people has been woven. The shcolarship is never pretentious or dull, and the stories are told with a sensitivity that avoids any awkwardness in dealing with subjects like magic. The stories are products of the Celtic culture and are presented in that context. They appear, not as childish fairy tales, but as rich and vibrant reminders of a culture that thrived in Britain for about a thousand years."
2,Pictoral oveview of Celtic history,"This book is a visual delight to anyone curious about the Celts.It includes little known legends ,and lavish illustration.There are few books that provide such a vivid doorway,to the shrouded past."
5,Best First Doll,"We bought this for our daughter when she turned one. She is turning 3 in a month, and this is still her favorite toy, hands down! It's been washed and dried countless times, sleeps with her every night, goes on adventures every day, and has held up great. We are buying another for little sister's birthday!"
3,Doll review,"It was not really what I expected. It seems like a lot to pay for this doll. I wouldn't order it again. My grranddaugther liked it, so I guess it makes it worth it."
1,Step away from this book!!,Yawn..............I used to enjoy Silverberg's books and stories. What has changed? Not very well done. I cannot recommend this.
1,Roma Insomnia,"The only reason I ever finished this book is because I used it as a sleep aid when I could not sleep. Forget about tylenol pm....try a little ""Eterna""......"
3,"Good diversion, but minor Silverberg","Robert Silverberg, with fifty years of writing and hundreds of books behind him, has been in the business too long to write a really bad book, but this collected short story series is the kind of thing that likely didn't take much effort of his to produce. Compared to the average SF alternate history book, the book is well written and enjoyable; but, compared to Silverberg's best work (much of which is shamefully out of print) it's not what one should read to get a true view of what this year's Science Fiction Writers Grandmaster Award winner is capable of."
3,Interesting for the anecdotes...,"For those interested in more details of Brown's life and some insight into his character and musical discipline, this is a valuable source. Discussions of musical examples are often naive and somewhat inaccurate, but the book is interesting for the informative quotes from musicians and friends and an entertaining read for fans of the late Clifford Brown."
3,good biography,"This is a good biography. Nevertheless, musical analyses are very weak and superflous."
4,Alaska myteries,I fully enjoyed the Kate Shugak series. I have read most of them. They also gave you a view of how things are in Alaska.
3,Not One Of Her Best,"Too much detail concerning the oil business in Alaska. The plot could have been a bit stronger. Good characters, as always, and an action filled conclusion save the story."
4,Another excellent outing for Stabenow,"I'm not an aficionado of mysteries. I make three exceptions: Robert P. Parker, Kathy Brandt, and Dana Stabenow. Stabenow, like Brandt, makes excellent use of her locations. Alaska is basically a character in each tale of sleuth Kate Shugak. Stabenow has a knack for drawing the reader into a different part of the Alaskan realm in each book, while keeping us interested in Kate's life, loves, and perils. This is another fast, enchanting read by a master of her craft.Matt Billeauthorwww.mattwriter.com"
1,"Exhaustive, but exhausting","Delves deep into the legacy of the Cardinals for classic contests, but the writing is dull, cliched, and windy."
2,A good general guide,"This book does have some great tips but when it comes to specific locations it falls short. When I went to several towns looking for the locations mentioned in the book, I fould many locals unaware of them. Some have never heard of them and I could never find the location. Maybe if a specific departure location was givin (city or port) instead of a bay or area, would be helpful. Great photography by the way."
3,"Quick delivery, cheap elastic on band.","I was disappointed in the band and the straps which were extremely short. Because of the short straps pulling the bra up, the weak elastic of the band caused this bra to ride up and my breasts to start falling out of the bottom. Stronger elastic on the band would have solved the problem. This is a manufacturing problem, not a problem with the retailer who shipped immediately in good packaging."
3,Better design needed,Don't waste your money on this product. A small ice pack and ace wrap will work just as well. The ice component on this wrap is nothing more than small packets of freezable material sewn into the length of the sleeve. Once these packets freeze it hurts to apply it to your (already sore) shin when pulling into place. Several reviews have complained about how difficult it is to apply - place your foot and calf inside a plastic shopping bag. Pull the shin splint on into place and then pull the plastic bag off your foot. The plastic makes it easier to slid the neoprene on. Hope this helps.
3,Shin Ice,Okay product was a good working product but the sizes should be better. Because I am a farely small female and almost got the small. But I actually needed the large because it was too difficult to put on and take off.
2,Meh. Not so cold.,"I bought a couple of these for shin splints. They're a good idea but not very well executed. They're difficult and awkward to get on. It's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit. The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom, so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up. Also, it never feels particularly cold, even fresh out of the freezer. It's cold, yes, but it's almost like it's so insulated that you can't feel it very much. Doesn't last very long either. I like the idea of compression + cold, and this delivers on the compression, but not so much on the cold. Better than nothing, I'm sure, but I'm now shopping for something better."
1,small calf size = smaller ankle opening,The ankle opening for a size small is much too small to get over my daughters foot. If you can't slide it over your foot then it is useless. I was trying to replace a full lenghth one that was a wrap with a velcro closure. This one is a sock type. I loved the old one.
2,Disappointed,"These Shin Ice sleeves are a great idea, however I think buyers should be aware of a couple of things... Definitely buy a size larger than you think you will need. These are very hard to pull on, especially when frozen. There is much too little ""ice"" in the sleeves. Not nearly enough to give shins a good icing for 15 minutes. Loses coolness rather quickly."
2,"Great idea, poor implementation","As a guy who used to syran wrap frozen peas to his shin, this seemed like the perfect device. The neoprene sleeve holding an icepack to my shin was a nice step up. It worked great for about a week, then one of the ice compartments started to leak, then another, then another. After a couple of weeks, only about half the ice compartments had fluid left. Nothing was obviously poking holes in the ice pack, so I can't figure out where the leaks came from. My guess is that an improvement in the plastic quality/thickness for the icepack would solve the problem. Overall a great idea, if only it were more durable."
2,Not what I had hoped,"This product is ok, however there are a few things I didn't like about it:1. The ice pockets are so small that they warm up easily after being put in the fridge (as suggested by product pamphlet).2. If you do freeze it to avoid that first problem, the sleeve is very inflexible and consequently incredibly difficult to put on.3. I felt that it was smaller than listed on the site. I'd go a size up and if it's too big, you can always still use it lying down or duct tape it to fit better. I can't really use mine!"
2,"Great idea, but...","Make sure you measure exaclty. If you measure too small it wont fit over your foot. Then in order to fit over your foot, you get a larger size and it is too big for your leg. Not enough compression. Didn't hold ice cold long enough for me, might be long enough for you."
5,Speaks Directly To The Inner Person,"I found this book uplifting beyond comment - although Anna's personal turmoil, her claustrophobic environment, and the tragedy of the story don't necessarily support the word ""uplifting"", Anna's determination, willingness to grow and escape limitations, and her unspoken desire to know life as Divine was just what my own hungry soul needed to read. Trollope has once again presented a real woman from the very inside out."
3,"Good characterization, no passion, poor ending","Joanna Trollope developed the character of Anna beautifully. By the time she took her supermarket job, I was in love with her character. What drove me mad was that, for 200 pages, Ms. Trollope built an atmosphere of sexual tension. When Anna finally found ""release"", it was done hurriedly, in all of 2 paragraphs, and was dreadfully disappointing. I had followed this character through life-shattering trials, and was cheated in one clumsily written scene. Other reviewers have already pointed out the dissapointment of the ending, which convienently avoided a showdown between the two main characters over the central conflict of the book. Overall, I loved the character development and descriptions of country life, but hated the handling of love interests and the ending."
4,Good story!,This is story that keeps you interested -- I was amazed at how well the author captured the story of two people who really didn't know each other -- I have compassion for anyone who has to live in a marriage like this one!
4,Lovely,"I love this book, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that a couple of the major plot points felt contrived to me (I won't say what they are for those of you who haven't read the book yet). Nonetheless, it was such a pleasure overall that I was pretty near willing to overlook or forgive those contrivances. The characters are all so well developed, and the social satire is subtle yet right on point -- and the protagonist's (and other characters') pain, struggles, and growth are palpably drawn. It's also got depth layered with wonderfully dry humor, and I laughed out loud more than once. This is the first novel by Joanna Trollope that I've read, and I will definitely be reading more by her. Brava!"
2,"Good beginning and middle, disappointing ending","This story of a frustrated rector and his equally frustrated wife is realistic, but also quite witty. The main character has always thought herself as a captive of her husband's fate, however, when one of her children is bullied at school and finances do not allow a transfer to another school, she takes matters into her own hands. As she changes, so do the attitudes of people toward her. Unfortunately, as events approach an inevitable (probably explosive) confrontation between husband and wife, the author creates a truly disappointing ""cop out"" and, in my opinion, unrealistic ending"
4,But what about Peter?,"I just finished The Rector's Wife this evening, and while I can identify with Anna, I am very much wishing that Peter had had a chance at his own epiphany."
1,A Mindless Read,"What a waste of time! And I read the whole thing...why? Maybe because I wanted to see if it would get any better but it didn't, and I dislike giving up on a novel. Another shallow tale which jumped from one fanciful event to another. How convenient an ending for Anna to ""get on with her life"" minus the difficulties of a loveless marriage. This story is not a reflection on what real life is all about (I hope) but maybe I wasn't in the mood for escapist literature."
4,useful intro to personal criticism,"The first chapter of this book, ""Getting Personal: Autobiography as Cultural Criticism"" is worth the whole book. This is a manifesto for personal criticism, that both gives an overview of the kinds of writing that can be called personal criticism and the problematics of the concept. Some feminist theory is densely theoretical, while other feminists argue that we must ""turn our back on theory"". Miller disagrees with the latter, while arguing for a personally grounded criticism that is not necessarily overtly autobiographical but that is always *intense*. I also found this chapter valuable in finding other examples of personal criticism as well as references to other discussions of this method.The other essays in this collection are sometimes inspiring as examples of personal criticism, but I have to admit I'm more interested in the technique of writing (and writing seriously) than in the topics she writes about. You may find the opposite."
4,One Man Against the Space Pirates,"""Checkpoint Lambda"" is set against the same background as Leinster's Colonial Survey and Med Service stories and novels such as ""The Pirates of Zan"", ""The Other Side of Nowhere"", and ""Invaders of Space"".The protagonist of ""Checkpoint Lambda"", Lt. Scott of the Space Patrol, is like most of Leinster's heroes: competent and level-headed. When Scott takes command of the space station Checkpoint Lambda, he finds that it has been taken over by would-be pirates who are planning to seize a treasure ship. What the pirates don't know (but Scott does) is that Checkpoint Lambda is in the path of several comets, which are due to hit the station in a few hours. Scott has to outsmart the pirates, save the station, and rescue a girl that the pirates are holding captive."
3,There was a lot carefully left unsaid.,"The Temp Worker's Guide to Self-Fulfillment : How to Slack Off, Achieve Your Dreams, & Get Paid for It by Dennis FieryGosh what a mouthfull for such a small and to the point book. Mostly a book on obtaining cushy work at temp agencies, (I mostly did donkey work there, get them to see you as a person), the book also contains necessary survival tips for large cities."
1,Sickening,"Reading this book made me feel sick. The author tells you to lie, cheat, steal, forge IDs and other immoral things. The few good tips in the book cannot make up for this.Don't waste your money on this book.Better get a well rounded book about job-hunting like What Color Is Your Parachute by Richard N. Bolles."
5,Love it!,"Years ago, I saw a Japanese friend's collection of Black Jack in Japanese. I envied that. I'm glad that they finally published it in English. As soon as I saw the vol. 1, I ordered it. I keep collecting it up to vol. 12 and am looking forward to getting newer volumes. I'll keep the collection! ;)"
5,Does the job well.,"What can I say? The light is excellent. The price is acceptable. I wish the time it lasts on high beam was longer but that's life. Will buy another eventually, I am sure."
5,A very beautiful collection of Chinese music.,"I purchased this CD at a music store during a recent business trip. I did not realize that it was actually one of three CDs in a boxed set. This CD is wonderful and had I known that it was available in a boxed set, I would have happily purchased the set. Of note: On cover, Yo-Yo Ma writes a very nice review. Who could resist a positive review from Yo-Yo Ma?"
3,Michael Fishman is the best!,"I really liked this move! If you are a Michael Fishman or Taran Smith fan, you probably will like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. It is pretty low budget. The plot isn't very good either, especially if you are looking for an exciting movie. I liked this movie because of Michael Fishman. It is also more of a kids movie. Oh by the way, in case you don't know who Michael Fishman is, he plays D.J. Conner on Roseanne."
4,I am a data junkie.,"So it is great to have the historical prices. For the latest retail prices, wine-searcher.com is better."
3,Decent text with great pictures of a powerful Mick Doohan,"Mick Doohan first and foremost is one of the most accomplished GP500 racers in all of history, his stat's. and dominance in the sport easily convey this. However, what his fans want to know most is what makes Mick really tick and what were his thoughts on specific instances and circumstances. While this is done in the book, it's only on a surface level, and the book really seems to be more of a story told to us by the author, not by Mick himself. The best part of the book is the relationship that Mick was able to establish w/ Eddie Lawson, and his thoughts after his surgery. The book is nice, the pictures are excellent, but I would only buy it second hand. I give it three stars for the pictures and Doohan history that shed fine details on what most of his fans already knew before buying the book, but overall well done and a decent Sunday read."
5,"Love it, I almost wore out my first copy","I love this book. Most of the authors are not famous, but they knew how to get the heart of a subject is terms that you don't have to be a literary scholar to understand."
2,Disappointed.,"I recently purchased these solar lights and although they are very attractive, they do not shed much light. They only light up the area directly underneath it and they come on at the first hint of dusk and are out of power by 1 or 2 a.m. Which is only 7 hours..not 15. OK as a decoration but not to light a pathway or any area for that matter!"
2,Solar lights verus shady areas,"Solar lighting doesn't work unless you have direct sunlight most of the day, batteries do not recharge enough during the day to get more than 2-3 hrs lighting at night. I'm going back to the low watt wired lighting."
4,Copper Mini Metal Tier good buy for the bucks,"This little kit was exactly what I needed to get into a copper solar light disply for my home. The lights are super bright, but enough to light the walkway, and the charge only lasts about 4-6 hours ... which is still 10pm even on the darkest days. With some prices being 3 times this amount or more I think it's a great buy. If someone wants ""outdoor"" lighting then they'll need a much bigger (and more expensive) kit."
3,So-So Lights,I have yet to find lights like these that last. They always break or fade over time. I would just recommend not to spend too much money on a set (knowing they won't last).
1,Poor Quality -,"although very attractive, they don't seem to hold a charge real well. I set them up in the yard, they get full 8 hours of sun, but only light for about 2.5 to 3 hours. Very dissapointing"
1,Item cracked,"We never tried the hoop out because when we opened the box, the cabinet had a big crack across the bottom. We just decided to send it back for a refund. It looks like a lot of fun, but thought it must not hold up very well."
1,UNPROFESSIONAL AUTHOR,"I WAS VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS BOOK. COMMING TO THE FACTS AND REALIZATION OF THE REVIEWS POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE, I NOW OBSERVE THAT THERE WAS DISCRIMINATION FROM YHE AUTHOR AGAINST THE ARTIST MR.DAVID ALDANA OF THIS BOOK. I FEEL THAT THE AUTHOR MENTIONS HERSELF ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS IN THIS BOOK WHEN THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE JUVINIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM."
1,waste of money,"This book is a waste of words.It dose'nt take a geneious to know how to deal with your teens.All information is free search the web.I believe Mrs. Shaw is trying to make money .I am a resident of N.E.L.A. Ive heard what Mrs. SHAW has done to the artist Mr. Aldana, she not only slanderd his name ,she also has'nt payed him for his illustrations. Mr.Aldana is now a well respected latino artist he once was a active gang member ,ex-drug addict and ex-felon.Mr.Aldana has come a long way to find his place in the society ,just the thought of Mrs.Shaw's few words makeing Mr.aldana sound like he's commited a crime against children.What a terrible thing to do to a person.I think Mrs. Shaw should find some other kind of work .MAYBE SHE SHOULD GO BACK TO REPAIRING SHOES :)"
1,Inaccurate rubbish with a slanderous twist,"I found most of this book to not have only been written in hurry but I also found inaccuracies within its context. I implore this author to research her facts and take time to edit her own mistakes.Not only is this book poorly written and researched she has slandered the artists of her illustrations by accusing him of crimes against children, which has caused the artists to only lose his job but had compromised his reputation which he has worked so hard to build...."
4,Works as advetised,Very happy with product. Have used before. The only thing is you have to be careful with the amount you use. I have noticed the fish tend not to eat for a couple of days after using the product
4,Best price,i have purchased Algaefix from other stores and this is the best price. Algaefix helps cut back on all the green stringy Alage since our ponds have a lot of sun.
1,Use at your own (and your fish's) risk,"I've used Algaefix for a while. It does help to keep the pond clean. Previously I noticed the fish (Koi) would float up to the water surface, become lethargic, and stop eating, which lasted about 1 day or 2, and then they would come back to their normalcy. So I thought that was part of the normal course and didn't pay attention to it. Sadly, 4 of the fish, including two 20', died after the weekly Algaefix treatment 2 days ago. Learn from my mistake. Don't trust the label of the product. Stop using it."
2,Hazardous to Domesticated Animals,"After reading other reviews about this being safe for wildlife, I bought this thinking it would be safe for my dog since I've seen her drink out of our fountain. After purchasing this, I saw that the label says ""Hazardous for Domesticated Animals."" I returned it immediately."
1,Brown instead of Green,Pond went from green to brown but the water is still not clear. I do have a large pond about the size of an inground swimming pool.
1,HORRIBLE KILLS FISH,"It will kill any kind of goldfish or Koi because they require so much oxygen, and it depletes the oxygen from the water, it also produces ammonia. You need snails, scrub more, limit light, or clean more."
3,the late Zoe was sooo beautiful...,FIrst I really loved Zoe Tamarlis...she is such a unique beauty and rail thin...she may not be the best actress but she truly was an artist..the movie is cheesy but Zoe maked up for that...
5,DownTempo Essential,"I first heard this 2CD mix a year ago, and I still love it. If Kruder and Dormeister's ""Black Baby"" doesn't do anything for you (it takes a few times to listen to), then Bullinuts' ""Fourteen Daze"", Fila's ""Harmonicas are Shite"" and Snooze's "" Middle Class Lady"" will definitely fit the bill. If you're a downtempo fan, you can't go wrong here."
3,"Good & even inspiring read, but I could do without the politics and Jemima J references","I find it strange that I am the first to review this item, but not strange that it is now priced as a bargain book.I decided to read this because I enjoyed this author's last work, The Dirty Girls Social Club. This was another good read, but there were entirely too many political references for me such as (ugh, she is a Republican or ugh, she is a Democrat). References I found out of place in a chick novel like this.I also tired of Alexis' fat girl complaints, such as ""nobody will like me"", etc. etc. Also out of place in a chick novel ... we need more inspiring women!But ... overall the book does not disappoint and there is quite a bit of inspiration in the story of these three women.So enjoy the book but be wary of the political and ""Jemima J"" references. Chick lit readers will know what I am talking about!"
3,2.5 stars. Below my expectations,"In all honestly she ddin't live up to her first book. This is very disappointing in comparison. It seems as if she used a few of the ideas that created the old charcters and just switched their names or sexes.The title its self is quite misleading, it should have been, ""Relationships with boys, who aren't men yet."" I guess I kept reading it hoping it would get better, and in some ways it did, right after page 100.Suprisingly I did not care for one of the main charcters for half of teh book, and wouldn't have cared if she got hit by a bus. Its quiet predictable, and its as if she was very angry when she wrote it, so much negativity, and viciousness. But it was a fun book, to pass time.I am highly afraid of reading her third book, because it might be another repitition."
2,Eh.....,"I gave this book 2 stars because although some parts did make me laugh and some parts were enjoyable, for the most part I I kept reading just to finish rather then because it was a page-turner. In my opinion it was not nearly as good as ""The Dirty Girls Social Club"". Also, I know it's fiction and all - but this author tends to give everyone a nice, happy ending in like the last 2 pages... So not believable...."
4,Good Book,This is a really good book. I love all of her books. They make me laugh and cry. I can't wait for the next one!Adrienne Mora
5,Excelente!!,"I am always looking for books, movies, plays or tv shows that tell our stories: Hispanic stories. There are so rare! This book tells great ones! Stories of Hispanic American people in all the spectrum: the civil rights leader but also the famous mainstream actress, the great mother, and the smart young entrepeneur, and they all tie up as a bunch of Hispanic success stories, which are also rare to find in maintrema media. I strongly reccomend it!"
5,Fabulous Guilty Pleasure,"This book was quite enjoyable. I found myself getting so drawn into the characters, I couldn't wait to have a few free minutes to read more. I'd say it was like having a great TV show that I make a point of seeing each week, but better because I didn't have to wait a week inbetween episodes. I'm a sucker for a ""romantic comedy"" and a ""happy ending,"" so I loved this book!"
4,chica chisme,"predictable yet divertido. love the spanglish and the character building. the latinas say things that I often feel but don't often express out loud. the story moves along without being complicated, ideally to be read with a nice cold corona while digging your toes into the sand with juanes singing thru your ipod. even though you see whats coming you don't want to put the book down for long as you enjoy the girl time and hopefully see a bit of yourself in each chica."
1,Not what I imagined,"After reading the summary for the book I was very interested in getting to know Maya and Julian Jr. story; however, the book focused on Ruth and Mac's story. Had that information been in the summary I probably would have not purchased the book. I would have even appreciated if the stories were more intertwined, but Maya and Julian's story fel to the waste side. Needless to say I didn't enjoy the book; in fact, I stopped reading after a while. Based on my first purchase of books by this author, I will not be buying from her collection again."
3,Okay...,"This book was okay, not as great as the others... but okay. I think that mainly has to do with the summary; as I was expecting to get to know Julian Jr and Maya better and not Mac/Julian Sr and Ruth. There's more on Mac and Ruth, so if you enjoy the relationship (which I wasn't fond of), then you'll love the book... I also think there could have been more of Julian and Maya's story, as it didn't seem to be as developed as Mac and Ruth's which makde the book fall a little flat at the end."
1,Embarrassing!,"The cover of this book is attached upside down . I gave this as a gift, and didn't realize it until afterward."
3,Only a small amount is about snubbies,"This is a decent book but the title is a bit misleading. There were only about 3 chapters specifically on the snubby. I don't regret buying it but as someone who carries a snubby daily, I didn't learn anything new."
2,"Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard",I found this book to be a waste of time and money. The main focus of the book seemed to be how inadequate the Snubby is for self-defense and I like Snubby revolvers. The author missed or minimized most of the good reasons to carry a revolver other than that they can be lite in weight.
5,Worth the read,"Not long and drawn out, but it gets the correct info and message it is designed to deliver, and it is worth the money any day of the week. After years of semi autos, I now carry a S&W 360PD, and this book had a small part in helping me recognize what I was missing. Highly recommended."
3,"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","Although the writing is a bit confusing at times, it is a good read for the price. Validates the reason why I buy revolvers & carry them as main firepower & as backup to another revolver or pistol."
5,"High on the ""reliability meter""","Ed does a good job of outlining the values of the snub nose revolver. He discusses the simple advantages of this reliable handgun. Methods of carry and tactics are outlined as well. Ed's experience in law enforcement training has given him first-hand experience in extreme close quarter fighting. He has passed these experiences to us by sprinkling them in the book to help prove his training points. My recommendation: read this book, take the NRA firearms training course, read the book again, get a CCW and keep reading this book. The government in many states is too paralized to protect the citizens and it also is too paranoid to allow the citizens to have access to the means to protect themselves. They have lost the moral and ethical standing to deny YOU the right and means to protect YOURSELF. This book is a keeper."
3,"Pretty good book, worth the read, but misleading title.","I bought this book thinking it would be more of a history of the snub nosed revolver or a review of current models or something like that. It's more of a tactics book devoted to people who for whatever reason go around poorly armed, with just a snub nose."
3,Snubby Revolver,Not very informative. I'm not sure the author was really qualified to write about this subject. It seemed to me that he was living in the past when revolvers were the primary handgun for defensive use.
5,Helpful and interesting.,This book is interesting as a history of police weaponry and for current carry issues. It makes a strong case for a revolver as a backup weapon or a primary weapon when concealment is paramount.
5,a good read for a classic gun,"I think my Glocks are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I trust my life to them daily.So why am I drawn to snubby's? Probably the romance, the history, the way they convey so much without shouting it...they just state their business.This is a great read from a guy who really knows his stuff. It makes me feel great to know more about the snubbies...and there's some facts in here I really did not know...even with 3 decades of gun ownership."
5,Agreat guide to the snubby!,"This is a consise and educated argument for the use of the snub in today's world. The new version has more great information and I would highly recommend it, even if you already have the first edition. If you are a true student of handgun self defense, buy this book !!!"
2,Month to Month Gardening in New Mexico,"This book is not devoid of any information. A good start for beginners. Although it is really a blank ledger to keep notes on as one gardens. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who has gardened before. There are some hints and ideas within the book, but unfortunately they are obvious. Due to how the book is laid out, one has to wait untill the apropriate month to gain the tip. Not enjoyable reading. As someone who has read his share of garden books I can honestly say that I was really let down by this one. Try Another."
4,This Woman Identifies,"I keep this book beside my reading chair. The author has respect for all facets of the human heart. He is widely read. It is a treat to follow his quest with him, his quest through books.He has a unique uinderstanding of nature - both the beauty and the cruelty. This embrace of the whole builds to a message of wonder and hope. .I identify with Jeffrey Duvall's self-image as a refugee, a seeker who honors ritual, who honors the miracle of a group and its regeneratve powers, and who honors solitude. I can read a few pages of the book every morning as a beautiful meditaion. It is the work of a sincere and generous man."
3,fair price,"it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
2,not good enough,"The teleconverter is not sharp enough, especially for a high-def camcorder. I made a test: took the same shot with the converter and without; I blew the second one up 4x in Photoshop. There is not an appreciable difference. Therefore it is not worth it. I would not buy it again. The reason I did not return it is my lazyness."
3,It's a descent dictionary,Doesn't have all the words I was looking for but it does have some good explanation of certain terms. Picture and descriptions helps.
2,not good,"this dictionary isnt good, i wish i could have got regular oxford dictionary, it doesnt have many words, so, iwould recommend to get the new version of oxford american dictionary or regular oxford dictionary.. and this dictionary is huge to carry."
1,Zoe Mini BackPack,"This product was NOT what I expected. There weren't any dimensions given for the product when I ordered. It called it 'mini,' but the picture made it look like it was a smaller backpack (perfect for a 2-3 year old). In fact, it is just the size of a purse. We were really disappointed."
1,double check edge quality!!,"I was really looking forward to using this pan but upon inspecting it after it arrived, there were defects in the steel on the pan edge by the handle. It looked (and felt!) like someone had hacked at it resulting in metal burrs which literally cut my finger. I shouldn't have to keep bandaids at hand due to a pan. Returned it for full credit but thought I should toss the flag to anyone else to be careful and check the pan edge for defects before using it."
3,DVD WOULD NOT READ,"MY GRANDSON REALLY LOVES THE VEGGIE TALES MOVIES. I ORDERED THIS SET AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE QUICK SHIPPING THAT I RECEIVED. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE DVD's WOULD NOT READ. (JOSH AND THE BIG WALL) I DID NOT KNOW WHO TO CONTACT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM UNTIL NOW. SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS .....HOW DO I REMEDY THIS SITUATION WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE AGAIN????"
5,Insightful and rational ideas proved with numerous evdiences,"This book offers a novel way to explain the boom and bust of various companies in different fields. It illustrates the dilemma faced by executives of established companies when disruptive technologies emerge from laboratories. With his meticulous studies on the data from different industry fields, primarily the disk drive industry, Professor Christensen effective demonstrates the model of disruptive technologies and analyzes the impact caused by disruptive innovations. While the ideas and theories are insightful and sophisticated, it is not hard to understand the concepts provided by Professor Christensen.It is a very useful book to both engineers and managers."
3,Plenty in here if heavy going at times,"A very detailed book however it is now perhaps becoming a little dated. I felt that it also dwelt a little bit too much in the raw data rather than providing analysis of the results as well as direction. That said however the book is certainly a worthwhile read for anyone in business as it covers a rather unique topics that I don't remember seeing elsewhere.The major topic around disruptive technologies and their impact is truly a fascinating study and some of the conclusion are very much unexpected. However, given the details contained in the book it is not something that can be read lightly and briefly, you really need to dedicate some serious study time to receive all the benefits it has to offer."
5,Highly Recommended,Great book. Highly recommended reading on why large technology companies are often unable to win against startups.Also recommended: 'The Slingshot Syndrome: Why America's Leading Technology Firms Fail at Innovation' by Reid M. Watts
2,Reader from India,"Whatever Christensen has to offer he does it in the introduction. The rest of the chapters are merely a rehash of whatever has been said in the introduction with examples. So read the introduction. Then read the ""Book Group Guide"" at the end. And if you have time go over the chapters."
3,Ehhhh...kind'a obvious,"The material in this book is fairly obvious; if you have Christensen's papers from HBR and have taken any advanced marketing class, his book is just a repetitive rehash of this stuff. For the novice marketer, and one who hasn't been exposed to ""disruptive"" technologies and their impacts, this book may be more fulfilling. Otherwise, read his seminal paper in HBR entitled ""Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave."" If you're an academic or one who loves to study the fundamentals intricacies of this stuff - read the whole thing. Otherwise, it's just more cloud for your brain and more ammo for your boss to ask, ""What the hell are you talking about? Get to work."""
2,Am I missing something?,"I endured the drone of the audio book. He could have said it all--with examples--in a 20-minute snippet. Just three points sum it up:1. If you want to do something 'disruptive', spin off another company or a somewhat isolated department.2. Since it is innovative and therefore untested, be aware that you cannot project customer reaction in advance [no-brainer]. Refine the product by observing how your customers are using your product [another no-brainer].3. An organization's capability to go ahead with something innovative is to consider its 'RPV': resources, processes and values.Despite the examples, the book comes across as a lot of theory. And it really does not have tangible or practical solutions that one can start applying right away. We all know dilemmas; we want solutions."
3,Solves the Dilemma,"This book is highly engaging and actionable and helps companies understand how innovation is powerful and long-lasting. I also recommend ""Something Really New"" which was just released as another powerful resource on innovation in companies.Something Really New: Three Simple Steps to Creating Truly Innovative Products"
5,Best book I have read on business/product innovation.,Very clearly defines disruptive versus sustaining innovation. I am currently reading the next books by Clayton Christensen on this topic. Highly recommend these books to others.
3,it's just an old story,all the book just told you one truth: disrupt innovation. However it is right but a little boring and simple.
4,Innovator's Delight!,Very boring at the beginning. But an important piece of work that is still relevant a decade later. Glad I read it.
3,NOTHING NEW HERE.,Nothing in this book is new. People will buy your mousetrap till a better/cheaper mousetrap comes along. Management's attitude is always: Dont fix it if it aint broke.The text is poorly written perfesserese cluttered with charts and graphs.
5,No Dilemma Here,"It is the typical manager's nightmare. A startup with a powerful idea wipes out all the dominance your large ogranisation had. It can happen overnite and without warning.How do you stop this nightmare from happening? Well, the answer could lie in The Innovator's Dilemma.Kishore DharmarajanAuthor of Eightstorm: 8-Step Brainstorming for Innovative Managers"
5,Fantastic book for any practicing manager or entrepreneur,"Great book! An eye opener in many respects. An easy read, well reasoned arguments, yet very strong academically. Definitely a recommended read."
1,Totally disappointing,"This book is very much in the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" school.It reminds me of the university textbook written by the professor. You HAVE to buy it because you are to be examined on the contents. Thus the professor makes a fine profit from an otherwise unsaleable book.I found it indigestible, and full of truisms. It seems an amalgam of so many other books. Nice work if you can get it."
1,Awful!,This could hardly make enough material for a 2-pager. I can't believe people rate this as excellent. I want what the rest of them are smoking.
4,Can you know what you don't know?,"This text goes into incredible depth analyzing the disk drive and earthmoving industries and is very useful in drawing conclusions on managing disruptive technologies. In managing disruptive technology, his prescriptions are quite valid; however, overcoming the hurdle of ""not knowing what you don't know"" can be so daunting that no action can overcome it. The book is very useful in describing the issue and positioning a business for change given the limitation stated above."
1,outdated,"I read this book with great interest because research on counsiousness has still a long way to go. After reading books like Dennet, Counciousness Explained and Phantom Limb of Ramachadran I think this book is a little bit of an old fashioned repeat. Even when you keep in mind that above mentioned books are from the same date of publishing. I would recommend this book for younger with litte knowlidge on this subject."
4,This book is OK!,"Nelson provides an accessible introduction to growth theory. In unraveling the mystery of economic growth, Nelson argues that the key are usually the things that the standard economic models leave out or take for granted: history, corporate cultures and political institutions."
3,"Item fine, description of item not.","Please note that this extension works ONLY with the KidCo G20 or G60 gates. This information is clearly printed on the packaging, but it is not in the seller's description (BIGFLYSPORTS). It will not work with other KidCo Safeway models. I now see that another reviewer has mentioned this, however I made the error of not reading all reviews in-depth before ordering this item. As for the item itself, it appears to be of good quality & construction. We have another KidCo gate already installed and have been very pleased with it over the past year."
2,Not the most engaging book on the subject,"Barreca seems to have difficulty deciding whether she wants this to be a scholarly text or a (mildly)amusing collection of anecdotes. It tends to make points that are presented as fact, then backed up by something a character said in a novel written in 1930, or whined by a friend over dinner last week. Occasionally, Barreca makes an interesting, original point but such moments get lost in the shuffle."
4,Mae a Real Impact,"I read this book nearly fifty years ago, when I was an undergraduate at Duke. At the time, I found it very helpful, and I believe it had a significant impact for the better on my writing style. This is not to say that my style is all that good, though I am sure that it would be considerably better if I had followed all of Flesh's advice. I am in the process of reading it again, together with a pair of internationals whom I am helping with their English. The thing I (and my brother) are finding is how dated the verbal illustrations and language are, now that the book (first published in 1949) is over sixty yers old!"
4,"Excellent, detailed bio!","If you wanted to know everything about Shania Twain and her rise to international fame, look no further than this very well researched biography! The author went to great lengths to obtain true information on Shania - from family, friends, boyfriends, co-workers - everyone. There's even info on her elusive and extremely talented husband Mutt which is very interesting! Such a refreshing look at such a talented and humble Canadian superstar! Shania even gives alot of input into the book which is really nice!"
2,Boring...,"Hard to get through, I was bored after the first 30 minutes. It was poorly written, directed and edited... the storyline just wasn't there. It became redundant with lines of fortune cookie text scrolling accross the screen. Its too bad since the artists represented have been an influence in my practice. If you want to be inspired, Piece By Piece is a great doc. about the history of SF graffiti. Style Wars will always be a classic. Graffiti Verite 1 is watchable."
5,Good Book,"Fantastic Book! I enjoyed every page of it. It's a tightly, well though out and well told tale. The ending was a nice suprise too."
4,Steve roden is a true artist,"Those of you interested in music as an art form should get this record. Using very few source sounds he is able to make a very interesting album. I believe this was the music from an art installation, and you get that feeling listening to it, but it stands well alone. If you are a fan of Bernhard Gunter or Thomas Brinkman this is something to hear. If you are not, now is the time to get started."
1,Waiting for something to happen in vain,"Slow, confusing and some bad acting. Why was the girl in the movie except for her see through shirt with nothing to see. I did not understand the ending. He did not shoot the ""man in the chair"" and all the flashbacks suggusting he did seems weak. Did his partner stange a hanging somehow with the main bad guy locked up? How did he get away? I am sorry I did not get it. I even forgot most of the names."
5,excellent . . . but where is it?,"I saw most of this on YouTube, though it's not clear if I was supposed to.Excellently done job, very similar to ""King of Kong."" Fans of that move will definitely want to catch this one, as it features much of the same material and even the same principal characters. As one metafilter commenter wrote, though, it lacks that movie's ""narrative drive."" But unlike that movie, this one makes the video game fanatics seem much more loserly, although apparently not intentionally.The thing is, I don't know where to buy it. It was evidently finished in 2006 but apparently has neither been released in theaters or on DVD. I guess these guys have the film in the can but can't find a distributor: who knows?"
1,Total waste of time!,"This is a movie about how to smoke and look cool when u do. Almost every seen of this movie, Michael Madsen is either taking a drag out of his cigarette, or he's lighting up a cigarette."
4,Review of books i have purchased,I have rated the Louis Lamour books at 4 star because i find all of his books i have read to be interesting and stories that keep you wanting to read on to see what happens .
5,Totally engrossing - Everyone should read it,"This is one of the very best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. The amazing bonus is that it is also true and gives tremendous insight into being ""colored"" in America. I wish that all teenagers would read it. The insight it offers is invaluable. It has a lot of adult themes, but I am going to give it to my 15 year old to read this summer. After all, it all actually happened to a teenager. An interesting sidenote: I came across this book because several of my friends were students of Greg Williams when he was a law professor at Iowa. They loved him as a professor and a person."
4,I found this to be a gripping story.,The story is very interesting and instructive regarding the period and its inherent racial discrimination. I grew up as a white person during this period and could identify with much of the public attitude expressed in the book.
4,What a great story,Our book club love it and I remember how things where like growing up at that time it took me back.
2,solar lights,batteries needed replaced when arrived. 2 stay on 100% of the time so batteries need replacing daily.i would be hard pressed to order another set.
2,Need sun,"Malibu Outdoor Solar Powered Carriage Lights work fine if they are placed in direct sunlight,not so good if they are in partial or full shade. In Oregon, 145 of the first 159 days thisyear were overcast or worse. Not good for solar-powered lights."
1,Corelli fans beware,"I bought this thinking it was videos of live performances by Corelli, but this is nothing more than Franco Corelli in his 70's lip-sinching to his EMI recordings which he made in the early 1960's. His lip-sinching is poor at best, his acting is is a joke as he obviously can't express himself unless he is actually singing. It is an embarassment and he should have known better. There is no indication this, that I could see, on the packaging and nothing on the Bellcanto web site. Buyer beware."
2,Disappointing,"I read several recommendations on this book and it sounded like a good read. However, I found the pace way too slow and filled with uninteresting and unnecessary fillers. The supernatural aspect of the book didn't really fit with the small-town feeling I got from it in the beginning. I enjoyed the first half but found the last half dull and unbelievable within the context of the story. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"Pretentious, ennui-inducing claptrap.","Arensberg commits the worst of all author's sins: she's boring! This empty tale of an invisible demon is as deadly dull as the drought affecting the town of Dry Falls, ME. Her characters were empty and unappealing, especially Hannah who deserved a good boot in the behind along with her interminably suffering mother Emily. Arensberg's tale is a rip-off of a bad 1983 movie called The Entity (at least there were some visuals to help the film!), and the totally predictable climax is stolen from The Exorcist. Give me a break! To favorably compare her to Stephen King is an insult to the man. How on earth this was published by a prestigious house like Knopf and chosen by BOMC is beyond me."
1,I COULDN'T WAIT TO FINISH THIS BOOK.......,"So I could get rid of it! It fails on every single level, as a horror novel, as a suspense novel, as a character-driven novel, as a plot-driven novel. The characters are horrible and the story is boring. A boring horror novel - not a good thing. I had to force myself to finish this book and promptly left it in a hospital waiting room for some other unsuspecting victim. Sorry!"
1,Incubus Fails to Sustain,"I couldn't wait to start reading this book. Incubus stories are usually filled with sensual feelings and pleasures of the imagination. However, having this entire story told by a minister's wife and involving church members who would never even think what I would have liked to hear was a total disappointment. I returned the book to the bookstore after finishing it. I was forcing myself to hang on to the story hoping it would come alive. It never did."
1,Deadly Dull,"Incubus is scary primarily because it's so badly written, plotted and presented. It's inconceivable that BOMC would offer this self-indulgent claptrap as a selection because the author commits the unforgivable sin of boring the reader. The characters are unlikable, tedious and belabored, and the mother-daughter relationships are especially tiresome. A real disappointment as well as a waste of time and money."
3,Good but not great...,"I was expecting a ton of ""scares"" but only really got a a small handful. There was an amazingly intense scene involving a dog, and that one scene alone is worth a star! But, the author spent way too much time talking about ""cooking and gardening"" that it took me out of the main storyline. She brought up a number of very interesting ideas and concepts that I would have liked to see explored more, but...and the ending left me a tiny bit confused. Overall, I would recommend the novel, but it could have been great, when it ended up being good!"
2,Very disappointing,"I was quite disappointed with ""Incubus"", especially after all of the good press it had received. I have to agree with the majority of the Amazon.com reviewers who classified it as ""boring"". The characters weren't developed, and, basically, just not much happens in this novel. A reader had compared ""Incubus"" to ""The Church of Dead Girls"" in that it is more if a story about life in a small town disturbed by horrifying events. The difference is that ""Church"" succeeded splendidly with the story of life in a small town, and how there is no such thing as privacy. ""Incubus"" just didn't move at all, and life in the small town wasn't captured so as to be interesting for the reader. I won't recommend ""Incubus"" - there are so many books out there that are so much better (like ""Church of Dead Girls"")."
1,A True Waste of Time and Money,"Zero stars would be more like it. This was probably the worst book I've ever read. It was incredibly booooooooring. When I finally finished it, I threw it across the room. I'm a big reader and I've read some bad books but I don't usually throw them. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did. What really irked me was on the jacket it was compared with a Steven King novel. Sorry, no dice. I know that King is not exactly great literature but at least his books can hold my interest. I didn't like any of the characters.Don't waste your money or your time on this one. If you do, don't say you weren't warned."
1,This was not a good book.,"This book has a really pretty cover, and that is the best thing I can say about it. There was virtually no suspense, and the characters were not very likeable. I'm sorry I spent the money to buy this book."
1,Slow Reading; Insulting to Women,"This book was quite boring. While the first chapter promises excitement, the plot unravels before your eyes as you plod through this book. Additionally, the main character and narrator of the story is an ignorant fool who is surrounded by people who do not care for her. Her mother rejects her and her husband won't pay attention to her unless some spirit is attacking her. While I felt sorry for her at times, at others, I wanted to yell at her to wake up and get out of that strange town that felt like it was stuck in a time warp.In conclusion, don't bother with this drivel."
2,Nice story buried by pretentions,"There are moments in Incubus that will have you rivited. The problem is these moments are few and seperated by a whole lot of uninteresting self indulgence.While Arensberg can obviously write (there are three great, creepy scenes) her book is bogged down by an over all feeling of ""I'm better than this genre"". Her best scenes are the ones dealing directly with the demon/supernatural, yet she seems to be trying her hardest to rise above this. By avoiding sensationalizing, she had robbed her story of narrative power.One last note: Would it [hurt]Arensberg to give us one likable character? If given the choice, I would stay in a room with the Incubus rather than spend any more time with any character in this novel."
3,"Beautiful writing, great plot idea, disapointing development","Incubus was unfortunately for me a disappointment. The beginning was too weird and disconnected. The great hint of a plot kept me coming back hoping to be drawn into a potentially wonderful story. The genre and literary style is quite unique and shows extreme talent. But the writing stlye alone can't make a good book. The general plot is very unique and could make for a great story. But the author is too engrossed in proving God does not exist; even going so far as to misquote the Bible several times. The compelling but strange relationship between the sister and mom becomes too strange and confusing. It is very hard to care very much about any of the characters. I never could connect or relate with any of them. The resolution is never quite clear and I was left feeling puzzled and frustrated. Great writing, potentially great plot, but it's never developed enough to make the reader care."
1,"silly, very silly","I don't get it. Others seem to love this book--and I thought it trite and sentimental, almost to the point of making me sick. So much treacle. Yes, there were some nice sentences. But I felt the author was trying so hard to justify her ""love will save us"" message in the face of such horror, that I sometimes believed she would better have used her talents in the greeting card industry. Yes, I like the bravado of taking on Stephen King. Kudos to her for that. But she didn't do much except rehash an old myth, using sexual and gender stereotypes that defied my imagination. I felt we were headed straight to film. Maybe a screenplay would have been a better choice in the first place."
1,STINKUBUS,"Whether this book is supposed to be a ""horror"" novel or not makes no difference. It's about as exciting and/or interesting as going to the laundromat. The narrator is self-centered and not entirely objective and there's not really a character in the whole book that I liked. Arenberg spends her time dealing with the sexual frustrations of a bunch of Peyton Place wannabes and her incubus terror is more humorous than frightening. A real overblown farce."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I was interested in this book after reading summaries and reviews of it but once I had it in my hands, it was a real chore to plod through it. In fact, I am at the last bit of it now, supposedly the exciting part and I am so bored I am up at the computer looking for an exciting book to read next!"
2,Self-absorbed.,"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie, a few interviews, Leslie...Yes Leslie, you're thin, you are so disciplined in your workouts, and you wear thong underwear. We affirm you. Now go and learn about capitalization; you capitalize nouns that take the place of names, like ""Grandpa."""
2,Long time locker room veteran disagrees,"As a former aerobics instructor and long time gym goer, I was quitedissapointed in this book. It was boring, repetitive, and in the end, moreabout Leslie then anything else. I was hoping that the conclusion would beto celebrate our bodies, whatever the situation, but I didn't sense thismessage at all.""Insecurity"" was emphasized over and over again giving readers a negative message. If I was someone who had never been to a gymbefore, I probably wouldn't join after reading this book in fear that other women are judging me."
3,Gets old fast,"This book started off really funny. By the time I got midway through it, I was counting the pages until it was over. It got old fast."
1,Crude,"I bought this book after seeing the author on the Today show. It is filled with some humor, but all her talk of thongs, buying a dildo, etc are a turnoff."
2,No perspective or insight offered,It seems like a lot of women loved this book so I will respect that - but I don't agree.Like many women I have had a low-grade obsession with my weight and body but after reading this book I realized that I overestimated my issues.I had to stop reading halfway through because it was just too boring and ridicules for words. The whole book is a parade of people spending their lives fretting about minute weight gains or the C-cup versus D-cup issue. But that is all it is: a parade of people lost to the world in navel-gazing over something truely meaningless. The authors obsessive listing of numbers does not sound to me like someone who has recovered from an obsession with weight and looks (nor does her picture on the backcover). It is sad how small you can make your own world.There are a couple of really insightful books on weight obsession out there but this isn't it.
5,Women's self-image and bodies are the focus here,"LOCKER ROOM DIARIES: THE NAKED TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN, BODY IMAGE, AND RE-IMAGINING THE 'PERFECT' BODY stems from interviews with hundreds of women over five years, conducted in gym locker rooms. Women's self-image and bodies are the focus here, providing a survey which examines weight, changing perceptions of body style, and more.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,A well organized overview of the history of English culture.,"Briggs' history traces the development of English culture from prehistoric times to the present. He draws insightful connections between trends and events, and supplements his written history with a wealth of illustrations that, rather than merely illuminating the text, form an integral part of the understanding of the way all things English have emerged into the present."
1,"No joke, this is really bad","This isn't a movie, it's a TNT movie. It's ninety-nine percent ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and one percent ""Caligula"" (a weak Roman bath scene with some strip-bar quality women). Poor acting, poor costumes, poor scenery, and a tired plot make this film painful to watch and, for me, an embarassment to have rented. Just don't expect anything of historical or dramatic value out of this, for you will surely be disappointed."
2,Not worth the price,"I study Amazons in both the ancient world and in modern incarnations of the legends. You have to watch this movie without expectation of historical anything -- within two minutes I could hear how badly it would destroy anything vaguely historical. There is a plot and it does circle back to the beginning and reach a conclusion to the opening conflicts but the points between are rather weak. It has a soft-porn quaity to it -- lots of breasts and female bum, very little male nudity, the sex is all distant and softly lit. Ultimately it feels like someone had an interesting idea, some productors messed with it and got their sex buddies jobs in it, and the result is something not really worth you dollars."
3,"Pretty Flowers Barbie, Pretty Good","I bought the Pretty Flowers Barbie for my 4 year old daughter. Bailey is rough on her Barbie dolls, as I would suspect are many other 4 year olds. For this reason, I hesitate before I buy her expensive Barbie dolls with lots of special features. On the other hand, the knock-offs which shall remain nameless are generally of very poor quality. I found Pretty Flowers Barbie to be a great solution. It is inexpensive yet maintains the high quality and durability of all the high-end Barbie products."
1,Simply useless,Out of the 4 units: one did not work right out of the box and the other 3 lasted for no more than 2 hours a day.
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","They aren't especially bright, and I'm skeptical of the amout of solar ussage (came with batteries installed).Then again, it lights my walkway, which is what I bought them for.And its not bad for the price."
3,item is ok. picture is very misleading,"the item is okay, but the picture with the shin guard is very misleading.the shin guard is NOT included!"
3,Change of pace,"I've read most of the Ella Clah books by Aimee Thurlo. They're nice to read, different from the usual Raymond Chandler type detective. This gives a lot of details about Native American life. You could find that in a history book, but I'd rather read a novel, than a text book. I also like/read the Tony Hillerman books."
1,Where was the editor?,This could have been much better with an editor. I didn't need to be told repeatedly about not speaking a Native American's name -once would have been plenty.
4,Thurlo Morning Dove,Typical Thurlo good mystery written in Navajo venue. Book presents Navajo traditions intertwined with mystery making very enjoyable and entertaining book.
2,"Please, Once is Enough",I found the book repetitive and boring. We were told many things over and over again. And the set up for the romance with the Reverand is nothing if not ridiculous. Not interested in reading any more of these for sure.
1,3% failure rate,My husband bought me a Tivo for Christmas and we loved it until it died six months later. Look carefully at the warranty info and be prepared for poor customer service.
1,Stay Away From Tivo!,"I have had a Tivo for about two months. I will do my best not let my frustrations make my review to harsh. I hated Tivo. The video quality was poor, and it seems like they spent more time on graphics than on the actual working product. I was never told about the $10 service fee, plus that stupid dancing TV never suggested anything relevant to my viewing habits. How does giving Star Trek 3 thumbs up tell Big Brother Tivo that I like Spanish Soap operas? IF A COMPANY IS GOING TO MONITOR WHAT I WATCH AT LEAST DO IT ACURATLEY. Unfortunately I am outside my return period and am stuck with it, and I am addicted to the features of a PVR. So i bought a Replay. Now that is a well thought out product. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TIVO!"
2,It tried to tell me what to watch,"I am returning my TiVo after finding out about a few surprises. First the monthly fee. What? Second it records and tries to guess what I might like to watch. Ok , ummm I share a TV with three people, so who does it think is watching it anyway. I'm getting a ReplayTV. No monthly fees. It only records waht I want and it will give me six more hours of storage all for the same price. Plus I think the company has a straight-forward honest approach. Tivo is all glam with their bubbly TV guy everywhere."
1,"Keen idea, but a big disappointment","Well, the promises for ultimate control over watching television were certainly alluring enough to make the purchase of this rather-strangely designed machine (why does the faceplate remind me of HAL in 2001?).Unfortunately, what I got was a lot more than I asked for: a monthly fee, artificial intelligence that 'watches' what I watch & attempts to make 'suggestions' based on the widely-varying viewing habits between myself and my flat-mate.The interface is rather posh - I just wish that they had put the time & the effort used to make the swanky interface with groovy colours into a user interface that wasn't so convoluted.Looks like I'm going to the ReplayTV camp..."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL ELECTRONICS / TV FANS!,"I have had my 14 hour unit for a month now and LOVE IT! Those few people who say they had problems with setup are obviously electronicly challenged. It was a cinch. My only regret is I could not find a 30 hour unit in Cleveland and had to settle for 14 hour as I did not want to order online. I am now ready to add a second 14 hour, or perhaps a 30 hour. If you are thinking of buying one - don't hesitate."
2,TiVo vs ReplayTV,"I just got a ReplayTV for my second television. (I already got a TiVo for my big screen--but I wanted a second digital recorder because you need one for each TV).I gotta say the ReplayTV is incredible. Is it as incredible as my TiVo? Well, yes. And I think I like it a tad more because Replay doesn't charge the monthly fee I pay with TiVo.Also, TiVo doesn't have the QuickSkip button that Replay has. This is the BEST for zipping through time outs, boring stuff and lousy commercials.I also find Replay's channel guide interface easier than TiVo. Replay's is like my cable channel guide-so it's easier to use. TiVo's is based on shows and is a little more confusing.I guess that at the end of the day, I LOVE THEM BOTH (how could I not love something that makes television totally fun and easy to record? ). But I love Replay a little more.My next goal is to get a WebTV system for my third (and last) TV."
5,Tivo is awesome!,"When my husband came home with yet another piece of electronic equipment, I rolled my eyes. Then I started using Tivo and, man, is it awesome! We program it to record our favorite shows (all season long) and then watch the shows if, and when, we have free time. While we watch the shows, Tivo allows us to just zip through the commercials and skip over parts of the shows that we don't find interesting. And watching live sports is very cool! Tivo lets us pause, rewind, and even watch live plays over again in slow motion. I recommend Tivo to everyone that has a TV! And by the way, Tivo is the only piece of electronic equipment we own that even I think is simple to use."
5,How did I ever live without this thing!,"Tivo is unbelievable! Being able to pause live TV has changed my life. No more missing half a show because the phone rings, or someone is at the door. The record quality(although I've only tried at best quality)is excellent, and you can't tell the difference from live TV or Tivo! The on screen guides making recording as simple as can be, and finding a show has never been easier than with the search feature. The automatic recording needs work(I watch Law and Order, so it thinks that I would like a 1927 Charlie Chaplin Movie) but with the automatic software upgrades I'm sure this will become more functional. This is really an amazing product, and I haven't turned my VCR on since I bought it."
3,Tivo Personal TV,"Tivo's system is great, as all the other reviews have pointed out, but it has one major flaw. It is absolutely USELESS if you lose the remote control. A $500.00 toy should be able to work with or without a remote control. I use it in a combination with a DSS/Satellite receiver and pick up local channels from an antenna. If the TIVO changes the channel to watch a local station, my old satellite remote locks up and will not let me change any channels. Again, this is only a problem if one misplaces the TIVO remote.Just something to think abut before you buy this product."
2,TiVo customer service - what a joke,"I bought TiVo from amazon.com, saving myself the sales tax. When I got it, I carefully read the instructions, finding out that you couldn't use it with a digital PBX phone system, but analog would be fine. When I hooked it up, it didn't connect. I called customer support MULTIPLE TIMES, but they never returned my call when they promised. At one time, I was on hold for 45 min. One representitive told me to send it back to amazon.com, when the unit WAS NOT DEFECTIVE. I had to buy another one, when it had the exact same problem, for a grand total of 2 TiVos. Another rep said to go to Radio Shack and buy a wireless phone jack, which didn't work either. They cost me more than they are worth. I ended up sending the other one back too. The unit is really well designed, but if I were going to buy one, I would wait until there are more competitiors. It's still to early to buy one."
4,Inspiring,"At times hard to read, this book gives some insight into the man Bonhoeffer. His relationship with God, and the sheer intelligence of the man are most impressive. This book is somewhat discontigous and incongruent due to the nature of the source material, but the essence of faith shines through. Along with the direct works from Bonhoeffers hand, this is an excellent book, with lessons that still apply for people of faith, not just Christians, but all faiths."
4,Dealing With Difficult Times,"Letters and Papers from Prison is a most informative and thought provoking book. Bonhoeffer deals with ideas and thoughts that most of us have never thought about. Some of this very likely comes from his dealing with being in prison for a lengthy time. The book caused me to think about how to better deal with the difficult times of life--how to maintain courage, hope, and usefulness in the midst of such an experience in which Bonhoeffer found himself."
5,A Tragic Historical Record,"I bought this book not knowing what to expect. What I found was an odd mixture of thoughts of a man in a horrible position. The letters, poems, notes, and short stories run the gamut of emotions. In one letter Bonhoeffer is examining some theological principle and in another he is keeping up on family relations. If you read this book, you will get an idea of what it must have been like to be a Nazi prisoner and depend on others for your care. You will also learn how much Bonhoeffer cared for his fiancee and best friend. Three words of advice: 1) know a bit about Bonhoeffer's life before you pick up this book, 2) look into the new translation of this book that will be coming out soon from Ausburg Fortress Press and 3) be prepared for an emotional and moving look behind the closed doors of a Nazi prison."
2,Horseman pass by,"Bonhoeffer, it has to be said, was a man locked up in a prison. He may have been a visionary, a great leader, but he ended up in prison and had to cope with that. There is a drabness to his writing. It doesn't quite lift you up. It doesn't quite inspire you. Of course, it was his own choice. He didn't have to wage war with the Nazis. He didn't have to come back from America and put his head in the lion's mouth. He went back knowing what was in store for him. It's questionable whether he achieved anything after that. Posthumously? Possibly. But his writings from prison? There are better things out there unless you're a scholar or something like that."
3,Buy it for the Theme Song,"The pounding poly-rhythms of conga drums interfaced with orchestral sound makes the beginning theme one to along anywhere. Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not fare as well. Sugar Ray does not fit in with the rest of the tracks and many of the techno-orientated groups should stay in the disco-techs they belong. The Verve Pipe may be the best track except for the theme. But the theme's worth it."
5,good stuff,I read this when it came out. It's a fascinating look at one of the most enjoyable seasons I've ever witnessed. Michael left them hanging and they still came back and won over 50 games. Were it not for Hue Hollins BS call they may have 4-peated.
4,"It is ""Addicting""","Edge of your seat,page turing thriller. One of those can't put down books. Keep writting Christine we can't wait until the next book of the series to find out what happened to Laurel, and all the rest. Great reading, this new author is going to go places. Thumbs up Christine....."
1,Doesn't compare to Doc Ford or Thorn,"I teach writing for a living --literature, we call it. So what a shock when I picked up what I thought would be a pot-boiler by Randy Wayne White and was absolutely knocked cold by who, I think, is a genuinely brilliant writer. I've read all of White's books and they led me to other Florida writers: James. W. Hall, Carl Hiaasen and Mr. Shames. I have just finished Mangrove Squeeze and it is, frankly, far beneath the quality of the books by the aforementioned writers. It is trite, strained, predictible and just plain silly. Mr. Shames tries so hard to be a tough guy and it just doesn't ring true. He tries equally hard to be literate and literary. Same results. Sorry -- I seldom write negative reviews but this guys is out of his league."
3,passable comic crime fodder; Shames has done better,"'Mangrove Squeeze' is my third Laurence Shames novel (after 'Florida Straits' and 'Sunburn') and is easily the worst of the bunch. Yes, it has the same south Florida setting and similarly quirky characters. But the plot fails to ignite, and the laughs are comparatively few.In 'Mangrove Squeeze' we have big crime by the Russian mafia in small town Key West. A nosey do-gooder from the local weekly newspaper gets herself in trouble with these guys, gets her boyfriend caught in the middle of it, and ... so the story goes. As a previous reviewer has noted, 'Mangrove Squeeze' does pass the time rather nicely. But otherwise it is forgettable in every way.Bottom line: useful beach-reading material. But you won't want to keep it on your bookshelf."
5,If you love Lawrence Shames this book won't disappoint!,"Another fine book by my now-favorite author, Lawrence Shames! If you love his previous books as much as I did, you'll love how in this book he brings in a character from past stories. Lawrence Shames has a special gift of making his characters friends to his readers and I, for one can't wait to see them appear again and again, cleverly intertwined with new characters. I strongly recommend this book--and yes, even in the hardcover!"
4,"Interesting Perspective, but Not Much Fun","I thought this was a very interesting book. Around 80 years old, it gives great perspective not only into the scientific knowledge of the time, but also to the cultural biases that existed. 80 years is less than some lifetimes yet so much has changed...That said, while the story moves along at a good pace, I never really found it to be very fun to read. The characters were a bit cardboard I thought, simple solutions were often applied to complicated problems, and often the actual action - the resolution of conflict - was done in as little as a simple sentence (for example the resolution of the Tony / Eve / Ransdell triangle).I would recommend this book to anyone with some interest in classic science fiction, or in apocalypse stories. However expect more of a simple ride through an interesting story than a deep, thoughtful book."
3,Apocalyptic science fiction from the 1930s,"Two rogue planets, one the satellite of the other, are heading directly toward the earth. The scientists who make this horrifying discovery have a plan to save a small remnant of humanity.The story is engaging enough that I was content to suspend my disbelief at the implausibility of the disaster and especially of the opportunity for survival. Much of the entertainment value of the book is in its being old: news of the impending disaster is spread by newspaper; atomic power is being hastily developed; and the attraction between two main characters is expressed only in passionate kisses.There's plenty of apocalyptic fiction I'd recommend over this (e.g., ""The Road,"" ""Earth Abides,"" ""The Stand,"" and ""Alas, Babylon""), but ""When Worlds Collide"" is entertaining enough for a rainy Saturday."
4,Better Than the Movie!,"Once the reader remembers that this work and its sequel, After Worlds Collide, were written in the 1930s prior to WWII the imagination of Balmer and Wylie regarding space and rocket development, as well as the psychology of the ""hate cultures"" was brillant. As a young man my imagination soared while reading these novels. The screen play discarded too much of the character development available in the the book. I strongly urge any lover of good science fiction to get a copy for a great read. I only scored the original as 4 stars, but if you are fortunate to have ""When"" and ""After"" to read concurrently, then you will have a 5 star experience."
4,Excellent -- but certainly not perfect.,"After 70 years, When Worlds Collide/After Worlds Collide remains as one of the most imaginative science fiction yarns ever. I will continue to read my newly acquired copy of the stories (yes, both books are contained in the Bison printing) every few years.But there are weaknesses. The dialogue is overwrought to the point of silliness (example: the frequent use of ""Oh"", as in the following quote when the valiant band of survivor/explorers are being attacked by an armed mob: ""Fall back! Oh, fall back!"" Can you really imagine someone saying it that way?). Also, you may forgive the social/political angle of the second book, but the denouement seems very rushed, as if the authors had to speed up to meet a deadline.But the descriptions of Bronson Beta and its cities, by themselves, make this story well worth reading. Although flawed, this is indeed a classic."
5,"""When Worlds Collide"" EBook Availability","Is there any particular reason that ""When Worlds Collide and its' sequel""After Worlds Collide"" are not available in ebook format? The 3rd sequel"" The Terrans of Beta"" is available, but it is the worst of the books. I keep waiting for them to appear as Kindle books, but no luck."
3,"boring to me, but might be nice for someone else","less colors, only bck and white. I read until dizzy. LOTS of storys. if you like to read , you might like it."
2,Not worth it..,"This was a waste of time and money, along with the course with which it was assigned. Don't waste your money. If you're looking for ideas about exercises for the classroom, search for ""inquiry."" You'll be much more satisfied!"
1,Can Not Rate It... Never Have Received It,"I placed this order for my child's high school class requirement. I ordered at the beginning of his class, which was 08-22-2011. It is 09-23-2011 now. I still have not received the order. Guess I cannot tell you how great the product is but everything else I would consider a FAIL! Hopefully, I will receive a refund."
3,Fascinating read,"Patrick Gale is a brilliant British writer and the double entendre ""Cat Sanctuary"" gives this book an extra dimension. Excellent character development and story line. The sisters' relationship to one another and to their father adds an undercurrent that sometimes threatens to overwhelm them. Unpredictable and consistently well written, this book delivers on Patrick Gales's promises."
3,Obolensky Backgammon,"The content of the book was fine but the condition of the book was not good. It was falling apart at the spine. I glued it together again so as not to be losing pages, but this didn't turn out too well and I am afraid that it will continue to deteriorate."
2,A casualty of the information age,"I assume that when this book was written (1969), publishing standards in gambling theory were lower. Computers were not available to do ""brute force"" calculations, so no in-depth statistical analyses were expected. Gambling wasn't so mainstream as it is today, and certain myths had not been dispelled. So while I cringe at the statement ""Finally, keep in mind that in all games of chance the 'feel' of the dice must be considered,"" I give the authors credit for at least cataloging a list of canonical opening moves. Unfortunately, they have been viciously upstaged by Wikipedia."
4,Moody atmospheric post bop,"I have my vinyl 12 inch record that I put to cassette using top flight equipment recorded without Dolby noise reduction for a truer flat response. Also get The Real McCoy, and Inner Urge."
5,From the back cover,"When future psychologist and temporary bartender Liz Prescott seed quiet and shy Mark McAlister nursing a drink, she knows he needs her help. All the unassuming accountant needs to do is boost his confidence.. and get rid of that boring wardrobe. Once the transformation is complete, Mark can have any woman he wants. But what Liz never expects is that underneath the geeky glasses and bad haircut Mark is perfect... for her."
4,Sassy & Fun,"Jane Sullivan delivers a well-rounded, fun romp with The Matchmaker's Mistake. Her characters are fun, lively and full of great banter. I enjoyed Mark's transition from serious to studly and Liz's upbeat attitude and quick wit. I loved her degree in mixology! Definitely a book worth buying!"
1,Tedious,"These was the most tedious book I have ever read. I am usually able to finish any size book within a one week period (and that's a really really big book! Usually its 4 days), this book is taking 2 weeks so far because I am so bored with reading it and I don't even look forward to picking it up after my son goes to bed at night, I actually dread reading it.I purchased 3 other Nora Loft books with this one and all I can say is that I hope the other two are much better!"
1,Lute?,"Sorry. I haven't read the book. One quick glance at it and I lost interest, the reason being that during Richard's time the lute was in its infancy. Very few people, if indeed anyone at all, were playing the lute (more probably some kind of oud). Kings certainly didn't keep lutenenist in that area at that time; court musicians were playing either harp, vielle or maybe citole. Call me an elitist or snob, but I have touble dealing with obvious historical inaccuracies. It robs the story of its verisimilitide and hence, for me, its appeal."
5,Being there,"This book pulls the reader in with its seemingly simple, lean style. Putting the book down was like stepping back from a great pencil drawing and feeling all the lean gestural lines come together into a wonderfully textured whole. Felix's clipped prose and pastiche of stories lays down a sense of unadorned reality and humanity. A moving book."
4,An interesting take on the story,"The focus of this movie is on the detectives, rather than the Lonely Hearts killers, and therefore Gandolfini and Travolta got what little of the critical notice there was. And they are indeed wonderful, and deserving of praise. But Salma Hayek and Jared Leto also turn in fabulous performances as the dysfunctional couple who prey off of, and ultimately kill, the women who fall for their scam.This movie isn't necessarily easy to watch, but it's mesmerizing. Well worth your time."
3,pretty good film,"this is based on a true story and it is a wild film. now John Travolta and James Gandolfini are solid in this film,but Jared Leto and Salma Hayek turn it out. Salma in particular got it going on with that Glazed Doughnut in the Bag Body. She showed me something not only visually,but her acting game came way up in this film for a change. this is a pretty good film that goes a bit too long in some parts,but it is worth checking out."
2,I'm glad it was a rental,"Why are there so many decent names in this movie? Don't let the casting fool you. Two stars because I watched it all the way through.The movie just drags along. It's a crime drama that takes place 50's. The premise isn't all that bad, but the story/plot and execution thereof sure are.Don't waste your time or your money and if you really want to watch it, certainly, what ever you do don't buy it."
