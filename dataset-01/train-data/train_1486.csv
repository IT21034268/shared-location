3,Not What I Thought!,"I have to say, that with a bone colored leather set, it didn't do anything, soap and water would have done. Totally dissatisfied with the product."
2,very basic,This is more of a book for someone first starting out in the trade. Their are no surprizes here just basic electrical know how.
1,Average new cd of Sinatra's,The best one is the last one Two Shots Happy and One Shot of Sad. The others are rather ok but too average though don't sound very good so I can only gives one star.
1,Not even close to cool,"The great Peggy Lee once asked in song, 'is that all there is', and after listening to this a similar feeling is evoked. Style points for the talent amassed to create it but at the expense of substance. Not bad so much as confusing, nevertheless I can't recommend this hit and miss cd collection."
1,Forgettable,"Nice background or elevator music perhaps but not the sort of quality that will set your musical ear on fire. Momma's Boy? What a stinker of a song. Actually none of the songs sounds like a hit, so they are perhaps but a last hurrah for this songstress who started in the early 60's and is now the same herself. As this one marks the second consecutive sub-par release following the last collaboration with Lee Hazlewood, the future doesn't likely promise much better."
1,My gawd this is awful,"Eleven songs in all and from the very first titled 'Burnin' Down the Spark' all the way through to the last 'One Shot of Sad', sad is what this mish mash of a cd is. Not near the quality or creativity of Sinatra's early work, listening to this is like being subjected to one of those horrible PBS shows where old singers and old groups alternately perform and embarass themselves. This wasn't as unbelievabley expensive as Nancy & Lee 3 but it is unfortunately just as unbearable."
1,SIMPLY HORRIBLE!,"This has got to be one of the weakest excuses for a CD in the past 20 years. Nancy Sinatra's voice is a weak mess, and the production is the same on every song, which causes every song to sound the same. The entire CD sounds like it was recorded in one day. Her recordings from the 1960s were fun and catchy, and I suggest to Ms. Sinatra that she stick to singing her old songs."
4,Surprisingly Strong Comeback,"I have to disagree with some of the negative reviews of this CD.I was expecting to be bored out of my mind, as I was with Nancy's""country"" CD in the 90s. I find this album to be a pleasantsurprise, with Nancy sounding great for her age. Yes, there area few quick spots where she ""wobbles"" a bit, but for the mostpart, these performances would have been right at home on her60's records. I like the way the production has a modern sound,but the overall feel is definitely retro. And by that I meangood, concisely written songs that have some substance, asopposed to the dreck that rules the airwaves these days. Thereare one or two less-than-great moments, particularly ""Momma'sBoy"", a song that stands out like a sore thumb. But out of 11songs, I'd say 7 or 8 of them are really good. Standouts forme are ""Burning Down The Spark"", ""About A Fire"", and ""Bossman"".If you are a fan of fun pop records, I'd say give it a try!"
5,FANCY NANCY,"Got Nancy's new CD last Thurs in the UK - bad shop violated the street date. It's simply the best thing that she has ever done - well IMHO anyway. Just shows that with good production & a careful choice of modern day songwriters & songs the 'older lady' can still be meaningful & successful in 2004. Best tracks are 'Two Shots Of Happy, One Shot Of Sad', 'Don't Mean Nothing' & Momma's Boy'. I can now add Nancy's name to those of Loretta Lynn & Marianne Faithfull who just seem to get better with age."
5,Fantastic,"For those of us who do ""get it"", this album is fantastic! I love ""Momma's Boy"" - a brilliant and daring departure for Nancy and possible inspiration for another Quentin T movie as was her ""Bang, Bang"". There are so many great tracks on this album. Thank you, Nancy!"
5,Different but Quite Good - 4 stars,"This CD is nothing like her excellent 60s recordings. Her voice has changed a lot, but it has aged with grace and does not sound damaged by drugs/alchohol, which seems to be the norm nowadays. The music is different too. Trumphets are completely gone and some tracks can almost be considered hard rock. And finally the tempo - most of the tracks are very slow.The last track is very different from the rest. Nancy sings and sounds much like Judy Garland.I like this CD very much. You will be disappointed if you expect her to continue her 60s style."
2,Not nearly as good as I expected...,"for $90, I expected this privacy screen to block the ability to see my screen from anyone standing 5+ feet away. The truth is I can stand 30ft away and still see my screen perfectly. It does work if you try to look from a 45 degree angle, but if you're over my shoulder (no matter how far away, even at angles) you can still see the screen perfectly. Very unhappy..."
4,Dimensions Fit 'HP Compaq LA2205wg' Perfectly,"Privacy screen dimensions fit monitor mentioned in the title perfectly. One of my collegues has one made by a different manufacturer that seems to be better in regards to privacy. You almost have to be right in front of it before you can see theirs. This PF22.0W works, but I think theres better out there. Shop around...you can get it for $50 (shh+tax free)."
3,"Good screen, horrible mounting system","The privacy filter does a good job making my screen unable to be viewed from any angle other than sitting right in front of it. However, the system for mounting the screen -- a series of plastic adhesive pieces -- is truly terrible. The adhesive didn't grip, meaning the mounts would pop off, and the mounts didn't allow sufficient room to allow the screen to slide in as it is supposed to. Ultimately I ended up having to Scotch-tape the screen to my monitor, which is hardly a professional look. 3M needs to completely rethink the mounting system for this screen."
3,Good,"Yes, it does what it's suppose to and I have privacy to my screen, however, the screen protector does not stay on securely to the screen. I've had screen protectors in the past by 3M and it's almost as if it had a magnet and the protector attached securely to the screen. Unfortunately even though it says it's a 3M privacy screen protector the packaging did not come in a 3M package. Which leads me to believe this is a different vendor not 3M and the vendor does not provide that magnetic type of attachment therefore I ended up having to be creative so that it would not slip off my screen. Yes it it does come with these small plastic adhesives but they are attached to the border of the monitor and therefore the screen is protector has a gap between the actual screen and the border of it leaving it with some kind of shadow on the screen itself. If I had to do it all over again, I'd make sure the product is in fact 3M and not a no-name vendor."
1,Disappointed with this product,"I installed this screen on my iMac. I immediately noticed the display quality is degraded by 30% to 40%. The character on my screen used to becrisp and clean, easy on the eye. This screen pretty much destroy that. It is also dimmer than it used to be. I turned up the brightness of the monitorand it did not help much. I was hoping I can get used to the lower quality display after a while, no luck. After ten minute staring at the screen, I decided it is not worth it. I simply uninstalled it. For me, this screen it is total waste of money. I want privacy, but I do not want to take a big hit on display quality."
2,Not happy with this purchase,"I was very disappointed with the purchase of these privacy filters. Neither of them fit the screen at all (too short for the size they were supposed to cover). Also, what is given to attach them with does not work. As for creating privacy, they do except for the area that is not covered, so if you stand to the side, you can still see the screen and that is what we were trying to prevent! I would not recommend these at all."
3,Doesn't fit snugly,"The screen requires lots of clear tabs to keep it stuck to the screen and not sagging, drooping, falling off etc. An extra 1/10th of a milimeter would have been all it took for it to be a perfect fit... I can't imagine the tabs cost less than that extra bit of material would have.Very disappointed but not worth returning it."
1,Not worth the money.,Not worth the money. Cannot use. Had to return it. Scheduled return then they never shower up. Ended up taking it myself to UPS.
3,probably not worth the price,"Got one for my dell 20.1"" widescreen monitor. Does make text unreadable but someone (the boss) can still tell if I'm surfing the web by the outline of the window. Don't see any of the glare reduction that others have claimed."
2,Not worth the money!,"This is definitely not worth the money. If you think this screen will black out if someone stands 3 feet on either side of the screen forget it! For example if someone stands say 4 feet behind you and 3 or 4 feet to your left or right they will be able to tell that you have an IE window open easily!! It may be a little fuzzy but they can clearly tell what you have open. Another words, you don't have to be directly in front of the monitor to see your screen. No privacy there! Maybe my expectations were too high but I had a privacy screen before this one but my screen was updated at work to a bigger screen so it wouldn't fit and a new one of the same kind cost more than the new monitor so I got stuck with this thing! Too bad!"
1,...I returned it,"Was anxious for this to work - I put it on a 19"" flat panel monitor in a very busy office setting. I was tired of my snoopy co-workers making comments about what I was working on. Some of the material I work on is extremely sensitive. I attached it to the screen and looked at it from every angle and was able to read clearly what was on the screen - from near and far. I was disappointed, but I had no choice but to return it. I since have purchased a much more expensive screen that works just fine. Returning the product to Amazon, however, was hassle-free."
5,Privacy Screen Filter,"This product is Excellent especially because of the price. Comparing to the more expensive brands, this is far better a deal with the same results."
4,very good privacy filter,"as a new product it a bit expensive at 75USD I got it used for 45USD, but looked more new than used :) .Very good seller on time and very good packingadv:as said privacy filtering is very good,dis:expensive as newnot that changeable if change the screen"
2,its ok,"I purchased the screen protector for my 27inch Acer monitor. The privacy it provides is great, but the actual screen itself isnt well made. It bubbles out from the screen and the corners peel out from the top. I thought the screen was supposed to sit flush on the screen and you could remove it when ever you wanted? I used the ""tabs"" to keep it in and although they do a decent job at keeping it against the screen you can see the filter trying to find a way off of the screen. The tabs look ugly on the screen and they privacy filter is always falling out from the tabs. Not sure if I could find a better replacement for this filter."
4,Works Good,It darkens the screen a bit but very effective at keeping prying eyes away from your work. I'm glad I have it.
5,Great privacy screen,"This privacy cover is great! It is easy to put on and take off and really works! We are now in HIPAA compliance and it is amazing that people that are sitting right beside you, can't see anything."
2,Not a great solution,"Not a terribly easy to use or effective solution. It is challenging to mount with the included mounts, which don't hold it flush and flat against a monitor screen. This leads to a drastic loss of sharpness where the filter and screen don't touch. Additionally the filter cuts the screen brightness by approximately 30-40%, and also vignettes the screen badly. The benefit is limited to cutting viewability to just oblique angles."
1,Does Not Work,The 3M Privacy Filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen. Otherwise you can see the screen. You can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it. All the filter does is make the screen a little darker. Don't waste your money.
1,MISLEADING LISTING,"I just ordered and received two of these privacy screens for one of my co workers. There are a couple of issues between what is represented and what is actually being sold:1. The image displayed for this product is NOT the style of screen that is actually being sold. The screen being sold is the kind that comes with adhesive tabs, it is not the clip on kind.2. the screen being sold is actually for WIDESCREEN monitors, which is not indicated anywhere in this listing, besides a seemingly random W at the end of the product name."
1,Not Useful,"One of our colleagues wanted use this for reducing glare from her monitor. It did reduce glare but at the same time, it reduced visibility and so she could not see the monitor messages well. It was too dark and so it was not useful."
2,3M Privacy Filter,This item did not fit my monitor. It was not long enough to cover the entire screen. I was very disappointed that it did not fit
2,Does not serve the purpose. No Privacy!,"As the product description adn videos say, it does not serve the purpose as expected. The film is transparent so you can see whats on teh screen from any angle, not clearly, but you can make out vaguely whats on thw screen. The screen fades gradually to completely invisible black at about an angle of 90. At all otehr angles it only dims it and does not provide any privacy. When you stand far in front of the screen you can see whats on the screen clearly almost at any angle. It fits the monitor as described, but not worth the price. Waste of money. I would not recommend it to anybody. I am just too lazy to return it so I am keeping it. I had high expectations when I bought it because I have seen similar filters on my colleagues monitor and it worked superb. Too bad I dont go with that one and instead bought this. Please believe the negative reviews as well when you invest so much on such products."
2,"works well, but not sent with good tools to apply","We've heard nothing but great things about this so despite the high price tag, we felt we needed it for our medical office to keep better control of who can view various screens. It does the job, but not sent with an adhesive edge or anything so now we have tape on it which looks awful. We will keep it, and figure out a better way, but should come with at least one option to apply and look clean, not like a ""Jimmy Rig"" for $90.00!"
3,Didn't work for my needs,"I returned the product, not because it didn't work (it did) but because the privacy it provided was insufficient for a very public work area totally lacking in privacy."
4,Works Great,It took a while but I finally found a screen that fit my monitor. I like the screen but wished it would have come with more tabs to help hold it on the monitor.
3,privacy,"If you are standing directly over someone's shoulder you cannot see the screen. However, it doesn't give you complete privacy if someone is looking at the screen from the left side of the it."
1,Incomplete,Where are my tabs to install my filter. Pay $ 128.00 and I can not install due to lack of tabs.
3,This is an okay product,"So, what I like about this product is that I was able to cut it to fit. What I didn't like were the little stupid plastic clip devices that you use adhesive to stick to the monitor that is supposed to help keep it on the screen. I had to buy double stick adhesive strips and then have it stick to the monitor for it to work.Fortunately, its an old monitor so I don't really care that I attached it to the screen but if it was a new one...I would definitely think about buying something else."
4,Nice,"I cannot blame Amazon because the screen I ordered was wrong size. I was directed to the product number from a 3M rep and the screen is not the proper size for my laptop; however, it is close enough and works well for its intended purpose. I do wish there was a better method of attaching."
4,screen,It does what it said it does. It just doesn't stick to the monitor with the stickies it came with.So just use some different tape and it works great.
3,"16:9 24"" display privacy filter","3M Privacy Filter - 3M PF24.0W9 Widescreen Monitor Privacy Screen (16:9)While the filter performs as advertised, the attachment tabs provided failed and the filter had fallen off the display by the next day. We ended up attaching it to the monitor with packing tape which makes it hard to clean."
1,Smaller than expected,"This item barely fits my nineteen inch and I was very disappointed with the size. Unfortunately at the expense for this, I cannot afford to order another so I have it taped to my monitor at work to keep in place on one side only of the screen. Not happy about this purchase and that's rare since I purchase from Amazon very regularly. This fits more for a 16 inch monitor but definitely not a 19 inch!"
3,NOT for Sensitive Document Security,"I bought this since I'm now located in a high traffic area. It is great from an angle (side view) but NOT from a distance if they are coming straight on from behind you. I haven't had to have a security screen for years but the last one I had, you had to be sitting right in front of it to be able to see your documents. This one for sure won't protect any sensitive documents you are working on if someone comes up behind you. Not worth the money in my books!"
1,Don't get the good reviews for this,Got this in yesterday and it SUCKS. I can see my screen from each angle. Thought I'd be saving money when I got a new monitor by switching from my old Kensington screen. Guess you do get what you pay for!
5,3M Privacy Screen,Great coverage - perfect fit...definitely blocks viewing by co-workers' prying eyes - no glare...not an obstacle to performing my computer-work.
1,"Doesn't work on a 27"" iMac","With the new (2010) 27"" iMacs, the privacy screen can't seem to handle that much screen real estate. Three inches of both left and right sides are vignetted so much that it's distracting. I'm returning this. It probably works great on smaller monitors, but something large like an 27"" iMac will lead to disappointment.Now, if it only had cost $30 I probably would have kept it."
4,Knock Out Black Out,"Despite the mixed reviews, I sprang for this puppy anyway. This is not a cheap piece of plastic, although the mounting ""hardware"" leaves something to be desired and I had to pare about two inches off one end to accommodate my Dell monitor. I also had to tinker with the angle at which my monitor could be viewed from the opening to my workstation. As a result I have had to set my keyboard at a rather oblique angle to my work surface but the result is a monitor only I can see clearly.I'm still looking for a more effective way of mounting the filter to the narrow frame of my flat screen monitor. Otherwise, I would have given this product all five stars."
3,"Does its job, but darkens quite a bit","Overall, not bad. It doesn't have a frame, but fit perfectly inside the bezel of my monitor. Since it is very thin and has no frame, it won't stay perfectly flat against the glass, and comes out 1/2 cm from the glass until it makes contact with the small tabs that you stick on your frame to hold it in place. Basically, the filter gets a very minor bow in it. The result is that wherever it is a small distance away from the glass, it becomes darker than the other areas, and the screen doesn't have the same brightness across the screen. However, the product is generally of good quality and does a good job of offering me privacy at work. For the price, I don't regret the purchase and use it every day."
4,Works like a charm,I've seen these online and they are expensive. This one works well and maintains privacy. It fits right over your screen and 3M provides these little tabs to make it stick. I bought it for my office where people walk behind me all the time time and it works great. I feel like I can check my email or shop on amazon during downtime through out the workday. This also would be excellent for laptops on airplanes and such.
4,As advertised,This product came in on time & without a problem to report. The way this is sold you can buy just about a perfectly fitting screen for whatever size monitor you have. Be sure to get the right size. Comes with a few small braces that secure to your monitor with self adhesive tape. VERY EASY to install. The screen itself mostly sticks right to you computer monitor. So far is stopping all of the usual glare that appears on my screen when I have the window shades open. Much easier than having to adjust the monitor settings.
4,"good filter, but",the filter works well and does bring down the glare from the monitor. i could do without the privacy filter since it does make it a requirement to be directly in front of the monitor or you cannot get a clear view of the screen. I find this bothersome.
3,Privacy screen,"Although the product indicated it would fit the screen, there was about 1.5 inches at the top of the screen that was unprotected; the screen was the right width. Perhaps, for novices, the screens should be measured vertically and horizontaly, rather than diagonally, to give consumer a better idea of the size. Other than that the screeen works perfectly."
3,Decent enough,I work in a cubicle so privacy is important to me. The product seems to do the trick for the most part as far as side to side goes. If someone is in back of you from a distance they can still view your screen though.
4,"Great Product, Worth EVERY Penny","This product may seem a bit expensive at First ($70 for a piece of plastic) but I assure you it is worth every penny for those at work who want to avoid prying eyes. I sit in a very visible location at work that offers little privacy. This high tech piece of plastic offers perfect visibility when you are directly in front of the screen and near complete black out for any would be peepers from various angles. Product shipped very quickly, arrived in a huge box, strange for such a thin plastic film. Work is much better with this becuase removes the stress of those looknig to judge your work ethic. Installs quickly, can't say enough good things about this product. Make sure you have chosen the correct size for your computer screen. Good luck!"
2,Doesn't fit completely,The size says for widescreen but does not fit completely. It works though. My headaches were gone after some days. I have a portion of the screen that peeks though one side.
1,Amazon has a bad website,"Ordered this and it was the wrong size. They list all the screens based on the diagonal dimension and some vague term like ""LCD"" or ""laptop"" screen. Often they do not show the Length and Width of this rectangular product. It was a chore to use the Amazon website to find the wrong item to order. Because as suprising as this may sound, you can have a variety of Lengths & Widths that give the same diagonal. Also color pictures of a grey plastic rectangle really don't help. What would help is a simple table of dimensions so I could at least find a privacy screen that fits my monitor. So I am ~$60 poorer, and going to use Google in the future. Oh, and nowhere on the Amazon site is there any place to give feed back, suggestions or complaints. So I had to go complain about this specific order. I am certain Amazon will pass this along to the manufacturer and ignore their website problems."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this because I work in a cubicle with a busy passageway behind me. I wanted something that would prevent people behind me from seeing what is on my screen. This product failed. It does nothing to obscure the view from behind. In fact, it cuts glare so it actually gave the people passing behind me a clearer view of my screen! I returned mine."
2,Blah,"Screen itself is fine. however, the attachments dont work. very difficult to utilize the plastic tabs that come with the Screen."
1,"reduces glare, not privacy",We paid about $75 for this privacy screen filter. It did reduce glare; but the information on the monitor was visible even at a 30 degree angle. We had to be 45 degrees or more from looking straight on in order to not be able to read the screen. This product would not work if unwanted eyes were close or over your shoulder. Other cheaper screens work better. Save your money and shop around more.
4,Love it!,Received the screen fast. Didn't realize I would receive it so quickly. It workds for the purpose that I bought it for. It is perfect and I recommend it.
4,Easy to Install Filter,I am an Occupational Therapist and purchased this item for a client who needed to block out his service screen from prying eyes of customers. I found it very easy to install the filter. I tried both the shiny then matt side facing out and noted more privacy with the matt side. It works well and my client was happy. There are no bulky velcro attachments used with this and it is easy to remove and clean. It is nice and neat :)
1,PC Screen Filter,The filter simply does not work and is not worth the money. It does not reduce glare enough to warrant its use and using it in a well lit room darkens the screen so much the screen contents are very difficult to make out. I put it back in its box and stored it. Perhaps I will have use for a hard plastic sheet in the future.
4,Privacy filters,"I had to order these for my office setting, we moved into an open environment, everyone felt uncomfortable with their computers being open to the public. I suggested we order them, we received them within a couple of days, now the rest of the office wants me to order for them. they love them."
3,privacy,Works great but pretty cheaply made considering the cost easy to install since it is eassentially just taped to the computer ....
3,"Works, but clarity is reduced.","Definitely works in terms of privacy. I actually think it makes the surface more reflective, whether you use the shiny or the matte side.The real killer for me is that it makes the screen blurry. It only does this because with large screens, it tends to create a small air gap between the screen and the surface that causes the distortion. If I push it against the screen, it is clear, but it doesn't stay there itself."
3,Works...sorta.,"The screen works great if someone is nearby and to your side, but the farther an onlooker steps back the more screen they can see. The privacy range in relation to the location of the screen was less than what I was expecting."
2,Fell off,I attached this product according to the instructions. I wondered how the little tabs were going to hold the thick plastic to the monitor. I found out later when I went to check and it was laying on the desk. No one was using the monitor that day (out of office). This seems to be the only option out there so I'm disappointed it did not work as I expected.
1,Privacy Screen,"I ordered a 22"" monitor screen but received a 19"". I am not satisfied at all. The price was high to begin with, charged on my card and then couldn't use it.Very disappointed."
4,Not to shabby,"It really works and does what it's supposed to do! It provides great security. Glad I bought it, good purchase!"
4,Works Great,"Works better than expected, very clear from straight on and unviewable from the side. the attachment method is a little week, ended up just taping it on."
3,3M Privacy Filter - Decent for value,"The 3M Privacy Filter is limited. It's only good to block out people who can read your screen from the side. Anyone who is behind you can clearly see your screen. It's an overpriced piece of plastic and should really go for a price lower than what it is being sold for. I have a 19"" inch screen and the privacy screen didn't fit flush onto the screen so I had to cut it and use clear pieces of tape to hold it in place. The reason why I did that is because when it wasn't flush against the screen, it made things blurry."
3,"Too Small for 20"" monitor..","It says 20.1"" outside but is too small for my 20"" lcd monitor .. too bad i have to return and exchange it- it should be perfect"
4,Privacy Filter,"Good filter for computer monitors in high traffic areas. Nothing visible from an angle (only directly behind). Sometimes the little self-adhesive tabs that come with it to keep the filter in place don't work well if the lip on the monitor is angled -- the filter will still slip. But if the lip is ""square"" it sits just fine."
1,too dark to use,"I used this for about 2 days before I gave up. It was too dark even with the monitor very close to my face. I'm looking for an alternative, perhaps a shroud."
2,A little disappointed,"I had one of these when I was little and loved it so we bought one for my daughter for Christmas. I like that the light shuts off on it's own but three minutes is really way too short. She is only 4 so it takes a while for her to figure it out and by the time she gets a couple in, it is shutting off. I also feel like it is a little flimsy. I would purchase the cube if I was to do it over again."
2,Beware of overuse.,"I agree with the warnings above. I almost never use nasal sprays, but got a nasty sinus infection that was spreading to my throat and chest. I started taking the Afrin on Friday evening, being careful not to overdose. I took only one dose Saturday (yesterday) and none this morning. My postnasal drip has stopped, thank goodness, but my sinuses feel like cement. I can barely breathe through my nose, and this is alarming. I'm not taking any more Afrin. I believe that it is highly addictive."
2,Bad Strong Taste,"It just didn't give relief, and the horrid taste made my stomach iller! This product is bad if your stomach is sensitive!"
4,Modern pop from Brazilian pop star Alceu Valena,"This is a reissue of a 1982 studio album by Brazlian pop star Alceu Valena, one of the leading figures in the modern music scene of Brazil's Northeastern region. All the songs were written or co-written by Valena...Tracks include:1 Rima com rima (Alceu Valena)2 Tropicana (Alceu Valena - Vicente Barreto)3 Como dois animais (Alceu Valena)4 Pelas ruas que andei (Alceu Valena - Vicente Barreto)5 Martelo alagoano (Alceu Valena)6 Lava mágoas (Alceu Valena - Dominguinhos)7 Cavalo de pau (Alceu Valena)8 Maracatu (Ascenso Ferreira - Alceu Valena)"
5,One of the greatest accidental recordings of the '90s,Picked it up after catching Curtis Harvey and Orso at Metro Cafe in DC. Can't stop listening to it. You are lucky to have stumbled upon this
3,My humble opinion..,"As a preface, the ""Lonesome Dove"" series is the high bench mark for me. ""The Big Sky"" is also right up there. That being said, ""Monty Walsh"" is an alright read, but does not come close to either. First off, it is not like a regular novel. The book skips forward about five years at a time. The author does make that clear in the preface, but I had not read it in anyone's reviews. I would have liked it to flow along better. I could not start to really like the characters, before there was another jump. The ending was to easy to see coming. I'm not trying say that YOU would not fall in love with the book. It just wasn't that great for me."
5,Best book about life on the range ever written,"I was raised in the cattle country of northcentral Montana around old cowpunchers and this book describes the character of these men like no other. The toughness of body, depth of character and love of life that Jack Schaffer brings out in the pages of this book are true to life. I cannot remember how many times I have read the book, but I have worn out two copies. If tales of the old West are your pleasure, this book can't be beat. It is followed closely by Charles M. Russell's ""Trails Plowed Under."""
5,"A Fine ""biography""","Though it is a fiction book, and really a series of interconneted short stories, it is a classic history of the old west from trail-driving days to the automobile, and the relationship between two men over a lifetime. I have read and reread this book so many times over the years it is hard to count, and have given copies of it to ranchers and cowboys that I know and they all share this opinion. It is the finest read on the subject ever! It is the only book I have ever read that induced me to contact the author, Jack Schaefer, and he was kind enough to speak with me for about 45 minutes! He is also the author of ""Shane"", and although the movies of the same names were both classics they do not compare with the marvelous books on which they are loosely based. If you like Westerns, you will love this one!"
5,What a great story.,"I read this book many years ago, have bought many copies I've given for gifts. It tells a slow wonderful story of a man and a way of life. I wish people were more like Monte."
4,A Great Western,"The Western is much neglected in modern literature. Schaefer's ""Monte Walsh"" isn't fancy, it is simply a great Western. It stands with Elmer Kelton's Hewey Calloway trilogy."
2,a missed opportunity,"For all the talent present here the simple fact is that this cover version of the house classic Break 4 Love is just not that good. Considering especially the original was recorded almost 20 years ago by Raze and still has more life and more energy than this version, it is a hundred times better and probably cost one hundreth to make. Galling, really. Pet Shop Boys have a great history of cranking out a stomping cover every few years( think ""Always On My Mind"", ""Go West"", ""Somewhere"" the list goes on....), but this is just lacking."
4,playgroups,"Carren Joye author of ""Homeschooling more than one child"", wrote this fantastic book about playgroups. Not only will it guide you on how to start a playgroup, but also gives you help on all the ins and outs of maintaining one. Whether you are a looking for an existing playgroup or want to start one of your own; this book will give you the tools to make a successful playgroup for your child.What I loved the most about this book was the fact that it was packed full of tangible activities and step by step instructions for playgroups. Joye even gives you advice on overcoming problems and including parent interactions. Did I mention there is a list of Internet resources in the back and examples of playgroup fliers to distribute. This book could serve as a guideline to multiple types of playgroups including young children, homeschooling, stay at home Dads and special needs.So if you have been thinking about starting a playgroup in your area, pick up this book."
4,Very helpful start-up guide,"I already run playgroups, but I wanted some ideas about structure and she has plenty of good ones. I would say that the information about getting going is a bit wordy, but it is very thought out. Only two criticisms - the first is that many of the links in the book are no longer active and it is geared towards Americans (I live in Europe). Overall, an excellent start-up guide for the Mom doing this from scratch!"
5,Hysterical! Scream!,"I'll take a line from Angela Snow here and say merely, ""Scream!"" You will not be sorry you read this trilogy."
3,"Good Product, AWFULL shipping cost from TigerDirect",This product is great but TigerDirect charges way to much for shipping and handling. Better buy directly from Amazon that has better shipping charges
1,Terrible reliability of the controller. Many of these gone bad in less than a year,"Terrible reliability of the controller. At my company all of these (5 or 6) has gone bad in less than a year!Signs of the controller (TFDU8072) went out, not necessarily all of the symptoms:*The LED light is lit red color (instead of blue when everything is alright).*Hard drive doesn't spin.*Computer doesn't recognize the USB connected to it.Obviously almost 99% of this USB devices is an absolute loss to say the least, the only nice part is the material of the enclosure.Also do not throw away the whole thing once it goes bad. If you have any valuable data on it, take it to any PC repair shop (Geek Squad, Office Depot, etc) so they can extract that data for you.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this technology."
1,fantom drives are garbage,"I'd advise against anything from this manufacturer. My experience is that their products are shoddy, made with cheap components, and therefore don't last. First, you get increasing noise. Then you get intermittent cacophony. Then you get a failing disk.If you want recommendations: I've been happy with Maxtor and Western Digital products."
5,A Classic That Will Survive the Ages,"I've been listening to this music since 1964 and it still sounds good!Maynard was a remarkable man, a very spiritual, creative cat, who took his music to the public during his non-stop caravan of life that found him in India, the UK, and all over the US playing for kids who found the excitement of Jazz through his horn.Maynard Ferguson lives!"
5,Oh Amy,"I hadn't seen her for quite a while, actually since the 90's and someone sent her and Vince on the Fb doing a duet Christmas song so I went searching and found this here... This disc reminded me why I Loved her so much... Every song on it was done so well it was a joy to visit her again !!!"
5,Amy Grant is Alive!,This DVD is great. a relaxing stage reflect the mood of the show. Good selection of songs. Amy's face glows. She is just beautiful! I met her backstage once and she was very nice. She even offered me to have a late night supper but I had to decline since I had to work the next morning. A super nice person!
1,Disaterous editing,"This rating is not for Amy, whom I love, or the concert which would have been great had I been there. It is for the disjointed, chaotic editing. I got eye strain after 3 songs and had to just close my eyes and listen. This is the kind of editing I expect for a hard rock concert. I expected a smoother, more relaxing experience with Amy Grant. Amy gets 5 stars any day in my book. But whomever created this DVD gets 0."
3,"Great listening, bad viewing","After having been a fan of Amy Grants since the early 1980's, I enjoy every one of her songs. The acoustics at this hall were outstanding. The background and stage scene were very conducive to what her goal was, an intimate stage setting. But everytime there was a beat to her song, the cameras switched scenes every second and was very distracting. I also wanted to jump on stage and pull her hair back (it covered her right eye the whole time except one song)."
3,sub-par,"Looks to me like ""Cathy E"" is the only reviewer here who looked at this objectively. The editing on this is a total disaster! It *almost*, as Cathy E said, resembles a hard rock concert, except that, in this case, it even lacks the visual rhythm that most hard rock concerts would have. Digital zooms and pans are used, apparently just because someone was enjoying the new editing toy.The sound is nowhere near what DVD is capable of either. And, as compared to the times I've heard Amy live, this performance borders on lifeless. Unless you're a diehard Amy completist, I really think you should try to find a rental to look at before you decide if you want to buy."
3,Terrible Editing,"I love Amy Grant. She is a fantastic songwriter and entertainer. But the editing on this DVD is just plain BAD. The editor must have been a video game writer. Every 1/2 second (or less) the scenes change.Also as a musician, I like to watch the guitar player, BUT, they mixed clips from the two shows they did in Texas. One second the guitar player had one guitar the next second he had another guitar and then back again. I believe they whole problem was that they did not have enough cameras. So they would throw in scenes from either show to give them multiple angles.At one point several of the songs were in black and white. For ""special effect""? I believe they had cheap cameras that could not record well in color under low light conditions.Yes, I have this DVD and I love to watch it for the musical content, but please re-edit the thing!!!"
2,Time Again...Amy Grant Live DVD,"Am a big Amy Grant mark, and music contained on this dvd is just wonderful, but I must have to say that the direction of this concert DVD is beyond bizarre.The director seemed to want to cut angles on every beat of some songs on DVD. Why ? What was the point ? All it did was create a dizzying and often irritating reaction and I can see why you can grab this dvd for as little as 2.99 new.I realize that some folks like to be creative, but this was not a dvd I would tell everyone to stay away from.Not flattering to anyone involved in decision making as far as what direction this would take in filming and editing.How about re-releasing this as a normal concert film ?Final word...buy the cd and skip dvd unless you have a good supply of dramamine !"
3,Not What I Thought,"I had gotten this book because the books The Most Evil Mobsters in History and The Most Evil Secret Societies in History were interesting. This fell short of expectations. Almost all of the women were simply murderers. Yes, heinous crimes, but there was very little variety of types of evil. If a book about evil men came out, they probably wouldn't include simple murderers; this book should have been titled Women Murderers in History. There were some interesting people in it however, so it's probably still worth a read if you're interested."
2,correction,"Sara - I believe Karla Homolka *was* in the book.I didn't finish reading it; I guess that goes to show you how good this book was. I skipped the ""political leaders"" chapters, because they REALLY sucked."
1,PUHLEEZ!,"Come on Shelley - THE MOST EVIL?....THE WORD IS ""EVILEST,"" BACK TO ENGLISH 101 FOR YOU!I'm convinced the world would be a better place if they removed ""most"" from the dictionary.If you can't write a title correctly, why should anyone want to read your book?"
3,most evil?,"The most evil women in this book are:Lizzie BordenAudrey Marie HilleyValeria MessalinaAgrippina the youngerTz'u-HsiCatherine the greatQueen RanavalonaElena CeausescuMary Ann CottonMarie NoRose WestGrace MarksAileen WuornosMyra HindleyKarla HomolkaSome of these women certainly belong in this book, but Lizzie Borden and queen Ranavalona? I don't know. Nonetheless, it is still a nice compilation of serial killers and despots, who I wouldn't have liked to meet. Some of the women were new to me, which is always interesting. 3 stars for the new information, not for being the most evil women in history."
4,actually...,"first, a note on one of the previous reviews: there was a complaint that nothing was mentioned of eleizabeth bathory, which i find valid- i would have liked to read more about her. But you also complained that there was nothing on Karla Homolka. Clearly you didnt read the entire book, as Karla was the last chapter, and rather nicely covered.now then, while i'll admit that some of the historical ones were slightly boring and also didnt seem too bad because everyone killed everyone back then, I thought this book was awesome, because there were a lot of cool people featured in it, who did commit some pretty horrible crimes. Should they be the only ones in the book? no, there are probably many more women who qualify. but it all depends on what perpective you are coming from"
2,This is all you got?,"Most of the women in this book aren't that evil. One of them was suspected of killing her sister with the help of her abusive boyfriend. Come on! That's the ""evil"" you're talking about? When I buy a book with the words ""most evil"" written on it, I expect to see a genocyde or mass bombing or something with some meat on it. Lizzy Bordon was not that evil! She only killed two people! How about the lady who was high and drove her car into a homeless man. When she got home she saw that the guy was still caught in her grill but was still alive so she killed him and tried to bury him in a park. She wasn't even given honorable mention in this crappy book. Don't buy it. Please"
3,Evil Women and Motivation for Good People to Act,"I was intrigued to see Shelley Klein's stories of The Most Evil Women in History prominently featured during a recent visit to Barnes and Noble. Later finding the book selling on Amazon for as little as $.01, I'm glad I only browsed it in the bookstore. Klein's anthologies on evil, from Evil Men to Evil Dictators, Evil Pirates, Evil Secret Societies, and Evil Women, offer a compelling study of society's most horrific abuses. Although her recent title, Senior Moments, may be a hint that her studies of evil are complete, if she does pen another, I propose Evil Lawyers. Regardless of the focus, understanding the breaking point and pathologies that lead people who could have lived productive, meaningful lives that contributed to society instead commit senseless atrocities is a reminder of Albert Einstein's famous quote: ""For evil to succeed in the world, it is enough for good men to stand by and do nothing."""
4,Evil Women is a good read.,"Many of the EVIL WOMEN are not as well known but their stories are still fascinating. Reading the historical stories of Ancient Rome and China, for instance, gives you a new perspective on rulers of the past."
4,Donkey Kong,The maps are a little confusing but they are very readable. Perfect for the children who are stuck.
2,"""New stereo recordings by the original artist""","All you need to know is what's printed on the front of the CD cover: ""New stereo recordings by the original artist."" No thanks, I for one will take the old originals, stereo or not."
5,A Certified Must,The introduction alone grants credence to the necessity of this manual. A must have for all pursuing a scholarly and applicable approach to the book of Isaiah.
3,Too thin and slides all over the table!,I had to hold it in place with tape. It's scratches easily.I put a bowl of soup on it and the picture faded!
3,Cute but not very practical,Pros: cuteeasy to wipe offCons: slipperyoddly-shaped statesgraphic scrubs off
1,Not laminated properly,I bought 4 different placemats at the same time. This is the only one that got scratched up and I had to throw it away after 2 months. Not good for eating on or setting things on like a placemat should be. It's cute but not functional. I don't normally leave bad feedback but this one deserves it.
3,Hope you don't have to scrub it,"We have bought a few of these place mats and they are all the same. They look cute and have interesting information and pictures on them, but you'd better clean them quick after they get dirty! After a particularly long and exhausting day, we just didn't feel like cleaning the kitchen after dinner. Our daughter had got some spaghetti sauce on the place mat and we opted to leave it along with other dishes for the next day. After the food had hardened, and the scrubbing began, the coloring and pictures began to come off of the place mat. All this to say that we learned our lesson- clean them right away and they will be fine but if you let them sit overnight, you might as well throw them away.but we did buy 4 others because they are cute and out girl loves them."
1,Terrible Quality,"As soon as you try to clean this, it scratches. If any food sticks to it because you don't wipe it down right away (ketchup, syrup, etc), as soon as you wipe off the food, the ink comes with it. I've only had this for a couple of months but it's going in the trash."
3,"Too many issues, too little time!","Ethel F. Smothers' The Hard Times Jar is the story of Emma and her poor, migrant working family who do not have access to Emma's one true love: books. Although the theme resounds with readers and depicts the experiences of some children today, major issues such as discrimination and segregation, which are briefly mentioned when Emma enters an all white school, are not dealt with thoroughly. The author's use of descriptive language does, however, allow the reader to connect to Emma's longing for books and provides the reader with an opportunity to appreciate what is so easily taken for granted."
2,super nOOb,"This one wont be in my bag. It is a disc shaped frisbee. It is good however for kids! i tried throwing it with no zest at all and it flies 80-100 feet in a predictable floppy straight path. with any adult throw it folds, wobbles, warps, dives, fades, and never gets past 60-100 feet. unpredictable and an impossible roller. again, for youngsters or those with very suttle throws who want a bit more distance than a putter but still want the feel of a soft disc this might work.overstable. good feel. putt/approach/children driver."
5,At long last,At last ... in the spot between Crichton (whose books don't sell well in the sci-fi/fantasy section) and DeLint (whose books don't sell well anywhere) was the Crowley novel I'd given up on ever finding. I'm very glad to say the book feels autumnal.
3,"It's no ""Little, Big""","""Little, Big"" being on my list of the 5 greatest sci-fi books of all time, and having waited patiently lo these many years for another masterwork by John Crowley, perhaps I judge him by a higher standard than other writers. But. . . I have to admit disappointment with Daemonomania. The imagery and insight of ""Little, Big"" are missing in Daemonomania, which also struck me as a bit obtuse and wrapped up in itself. I also found no characters to fall in love with in Daemonomania, unlike ""Little, Big,"" whose characters haunt me to this day. Again, my judgment is probably too harsh and I may pick this book up again in 5 years and thoroughly enjoy it. This time around, though, it was a bit of a disappointment for me."
5,Great!,"Great studio album. And Alvin Lee...well, what can you say? He's still one of the best to this day. Speed, finesse, and soul, a rare combination. You can feel the emotion of every note he plays, his emotions come right out through his fingers. An incredible depth of feeling. Alvin Lee is one of the best, next to Peter Green (when he was with Fleetwood Mac) and Clapton."
4,First taste,"Classic TYA! This was the Third Ten Years After I heard on vinyl purchased by a friend when I was a freshman in high school...1970. They also had the Sssssssh record and the Woodstock record as well and Ten Years After really was the band that got me on the road to discovering bands, Stereo gear and various ways of enhancing ones awareness of the details involved in ANYTHING. It's been a long road since then but the interest in music has not not weakened in the least anyway. I had all the Beatles, Procol Harum,Savoy Brown, Grand Funk, Tull, Zeppelin, King Crimson, Yes ,ELP, Sabbath , Alice Cooper, Nazareth,BOC, RUSH, Hendrix, Floyd, Deep Purple records I could afford and actually still have some of those records....or second and sometimes third verions of! Anyway...not a bad song on this record great players all!"
3,Don't Overlook Cricklewood Green!!!,"I first owned this on 8-track many moons ago. Although, this kind of music sounds dated...I still enjoy the songs 50,000 Miles Beneath My Brain...it and Sugar The Road remind me of Steppenwolfe. Other good songs are Year 3000 Blues, The jazzy..Me And My Baby, and Circles. Don't overlook Cricklewood Green if you enjoy classic rock!!!"
5,Excellent!,"I have to say Joanne Lund, has really come up with a great solution to people who want to eat healthy but can't quite let go of thier sweet tooth. This book is packed with delicious recipies for cookies, pies, cakes, brownies and many other choices. Each recipe is an absoule ""sweet nothing"" pun intended! Low calorie, low fat, and high taste. You your family and friends will never miss what is missing the un healthy fat and calories. Enjoy."
5,Dessert Every Night,"I'm the author of this book and it's a personal favorite of mine. I note that babysis56 writes that we did not respond to her messages. But, we've tried to contact babysis56@aol to see if we could answer her questions, and we've never gotten a response. I try my best to respond to anyone who contacts me in a timely manner.Not only did the Tooth Fairy bless me with a sweet tooth - she gave me a whole mouth full! And I share my favorite ""common folk"" healthy desserts in this collection. If you love the types of desserts that grandma made for you when you were young - but you need healthier (less fats & sugars) versions - then I think you will love this book!"
3,"very good desserts, but hard to find ingredients","The desserts were mostly very good, but the ingredients are extremely hard to find for some of them. The email address they supply in the book was of no help, as far as substitutions, and what to do if the name brand ingredients they have in the recipes are unavailable to you. I never recieved a response from them. However, if you are a little creative, you can manage and improvise. Also, be very careful if you are counting fat and calories, as the listings that they have, on occasion, were entirely wrong."
2,No Delight Tonight,"I was excited when I first bought this book. I struggle with my weight and am almost always dieting, but I love sweets and so I thought I could ""have my cake and eat it, too"" with this book. Not so.Most of the more tempting recipes in this book are made with sugar-free pudding mix, which wouldn't be a problem if there were aspartame-free pudding mixes available. I haven't found any, though.Aspartame gives many people (including me) serious migraines, among other problems. There's a warning on the label for a reason. I realize my complaint is as much with the pudding mix manufacturers as it is with this book, but it just seems as though it promised more than it could deliver."
2,Looked sweet but not a health food alternative,The recipes looked like they would be sweet. It was a little disappointing that a majority of the recipes were made from other processed foods. There appeared to be quite a number of Jell-O based recipes. This is not a book for those who are looking for the use of Health foods as a natural alternative.
3,nice,"i got the item really quik, it works great and the video is of good quality. the box is new never used before! i like it, good for a good night laugh."
4,Thoughtful discussion of Zen Mind: but only for the serious.,"For those interested in Zen and the Mind of Zen, this is an excellent introduction. Low studied with and received transmission from Roshi Philip Kapleau (""Three Pillars of Zen"", ""Zen Dawn in the West""). This makes Low a second generation western Zen teacher, and he is sensitive to western intellectual bias. He frequently makes useful references to mainstream western works and quotes them wisely, thus providing the western reader a gentle stepping stone onto the Zen path. Low has delivered a book that works the subject well but also the reader. Just because this book was wrtten in English and is not a translation of a work difficult in its original language, does not make it easy, but it is still much easier and more meaningful than diving right into a translation of Dogen. Reading this and other of Low's books has brought valuable insights, and provided the incentive to read the primary sources of Buddhism he references."
2,Not the way to learn.,"This book annoyed me. I went on to read other books in the same vein, though, and found it to be better than most; hence the extra star. I have a fundamental problem with the idea of teaching readers about no-mind and other truths that cannot be understood through words . . . through the vehicle of writing. If you want to learn about Zen, then by all means, talk to a Roshi or another person who has grasped something of its nature. Meditate. Look at sumie paintings, build a rock garden, learn the Tea Ceremony. Don't expect this book--or any book--to show you what you need to know about Zen."
4,So-So.....,"This figure is probably a dangerous venture for mega bloks. Because giant ""transforming"" cyborgs are pretty weird. The figure is pretty fun, with a firing grappling hook, on his arm. With a gattling gun to add more firepower. He is very detailed, but doesn't seem to be much of a cyborg. Not all of his parts look like generic blocks. Such as his forearms, his chest plate, his head, and his lower legs. His left forearm looks a lot better than older blok bot standard fisted arms. His supposed ""transformation"" is more like reconstrucktion. Like the honestly named k'nex reconstructors. He ""transforms'' into a weird looking ""weapon platform"", but something about the mode makes me like it. But, it does not use all of his parts. His fluid flowing action is pretty fun. Building this is a slight challange, however. And, his joints have a slight tendency to pop out of the sockets, When mishandled, that is."
2,Heavy iced tea glasses,Much too heavy if you have any arthritis in your hands. Keep in freezer for beer; holds the cold nicely.
2,Chips within 5 months,"Bought these because of the positive reviews and brand name. Unfortunately, more than half of these have come out of the dishwasher with broken rims/lips. These are the only glasses to do this in our dishwasher. Don't know whether we got a faulty batch with some form of impurity in the glass. Nice heavy glasses, but unusable after the lip breaks and turns into a sharp edge. Wouldn't buy again."
4,H E A V Y......G L A S S W A R E,"This LIBBEY GIBRALTAR 22 OUNCE ICED TEA GLASS, BOX OF 12, CLEAR, conatains 12 HEAVY, H E A V Y GLASSES. These are glasses which are meant to take a beating, (if necessary), in commercial use. If you have ANY physical impariment -- or simply DON'T LIKE heavy glasses, please look elsewhere for your drink containers.Great glassware -- well-made, with a nice thick bottom. But substantial. VERY substantial. If you have a commercial establishment, or live near an earth-quake zone, I MIGHT recomend buying this drinkware. (But not if you have arthritis, etc.) Lifting thesse glasses with one hand, even filled, IS easier than moving the Rock of Gibraltar, for which these glasses are named. Easier, yes. But not by much!"
5,"Big, heavy, and sturdy","We needed a large glass with the capacity for a good amount of ice -- and this glass is perfect in that regard. These are very sturdy, somewhat on the heavy side, but if you chill them in the fridge or freezer, they hold the cold for a very long time. Despite the weight, their shape is such that they're easy to hold and, for us, no tendency to slip.The fact these are made in the U.S. is another bonus, as we like to support manufacturers here whenever possible. We'd definitely get these again, and even if they can be gotten cheaper at 'dollar stores', we feel they were worth the price offered here."
4,Revealing myths and truth,"I am a veteran grunt who served in Nam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade.We spent weeks at a time out in the jungle on sweeps, search and destroy, ambushes, etc. Never once did I see the enemy as being human. A real person. They were considered as sub-human. This book, however, has done a little something to help change me for the better in my regards to our ex-enemies. I would recommend this book to any historian or vietnam Vet.It provides info I can actually relate to. Very interesting and thought provoking."
3,"Some Useful Insights, but Not Much Depth","A decent look at VC/NVA training, equipment, recruiting, organization and logistics. The authors were both combat veterans of Vietnam and their analysis carries credibility. Unfortunately, the core of this book rests on two very subjective sections: captured VC/NVA diaries and post-war American surveys on the VC/NVA. There is very little tactical analysis of how the VC/NVA fought and no analysis of specific actions (it would have been useful to dissect a few selective actions with accounts from both sides). Overall, the book is valuable for painting a portrait of a determined, resourceful enemy who made do with much less than we thought possible. Most important is the conclusion that NVA morale was sustained by their indoctrination/propaganda and the value of group criticism/group cohesion. Several maps, adequate but barely."
2,"""L"" is for Look for another","Of the Sue Grafton's series, this one didn't have the same impact as her earlier books. I was disappointed! The plot developed slowly, and at times reminded me of a bad 'made for T.V. movie'and the characters (other than the familiar aquaintances) lacked ""character"". After I began reading ""L"", over a year ago, I put the book down and didn't have the desire to read it until recently. I enjoyed her first books and hope that ""M"" is a better read."
2,Slow paced,"I recently read ""I"", ""K"", and ""L"" in succession. Compared to ""Innocent"" and ""Killer"", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising. With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line. I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome. Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...). I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in ""L"" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next. Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly (""M"" being one of them)."
2,A bit boring,"Oh I don't know. The ""L"" just didn't do it for me. When the characters are talking she often fails to add any environment to it. I grew bored thinking the characters were smily in a room, talking. Gone is the sarcasm and comic undertones that the PI has had in the past.Also, this Ray guy, well he says he has no money,and yet he hopped a two points in the story he does have some."
3,"Entertaining, if lightweight","I found this book to be amusing, if not great literature. Kinsey Millhone was a lot less obnoxious than modern female detectives usually are. The language was breezy, especially in the beginning, but the plot was miles below Agatha Christie's inventions. I would re-read this book on a night when I want something light, but I wouldn't call it unforgettable."
3,Not the best work of Miss Grafton but still on a good streek,"I thought that this is just a spoof in the complete series of Kinsey Millhone mysteries, i would usally rate all of the series with a 4-5 but this time i wll make an exception, a dull start but at the end it did get my heart pumping for a while, but soon my adrinilin cooled off... But miss milhone is still on my good side i give it a 3 stars"
2,Part of Grafton's downhill trend,"I thought perhaps the dissatisfying conclusion of K is for Killer was a fluke, but L is for Lawless leads me to believe that Grafton is tired of the series and is anxious to fulfill her contract. I suspect she's secretly writing on another project that she really cares about.Lawless was completely uninteresting to me. The ending was rushed and didn't answer all the questions it brought up. I really feel like Grafton's heart isn't in this anymore, and I must admit, she's losing me. I won't buy another of her hardbacks."
2,Too linear and derivative,"I'm a Millhone fan but the plot in this installment was too linear. It went straight from the beginning to the end with each twist neatly foreshadowed by some previous detail. A careful reader could tell exactly what was going to happen at every step without any real surprises - won't spoil it with a list.Secondly, the plot seemed derivative of Donald Westlake's Drowned Hopes (a great read BTW). At one point Kinsey and Ray even contemplate that the loot might be flooded when a dam was built - the exact premise of Drowned Hopes. I hope this was a deliberate nod on Grafton's part.In summary, it seemed to be a tribute piece written according to a simple formula."
3,Probably her weakest so far.,"I have now read all of Sue Grafton's books and am anxiously awaiting her ""O"". I totally disagree with one of the reviewers who mentioned (among others) Mary Higgins Clark as being a better mystery writer. I give Clark's novels to my son-in-law (who is French and who's English is good but not strong) because they are easy reading. It is too bad if anyone happens to pick this one up as their first example of Kinsey Millhone. Miss Grafton left too many loose ends in ""Lawless"". None the less, Grafton's wit, storylines, character presentation, and knowledge of her subject matter win point after point after point with me."
2,L is for Listless,"Grafton lost momentum in this book, though she regains it in M is for Malice. This is the first Kinsey Millhone book that I didn't read straight through. I put it down for several weeks in mid-read, and finished it only out of loyalty. If you haven't read it yet, skip it and go on to M. Don't give up on the series, though!"
2,My daughter made me read it!,"When you get a book present for your birthday, you read it. If your daughter didn't give you this book for your birthday, don't read it. What a waste of good reading time. What does Grafton have against people who are overweight anyway? Kinsey is always eating herself, I guess her frantic behavior burns off the calories. What is interesting about some 80 year olds getting married on Thanksgiving? Oh, and was there some money missing?"
3,Not So Great Mystery,"While there were several twists and surprises, this one didn't have the same level of excitement that the other books in the series do. There were suspenseful times and the characters were well developed. The final resolution seemed just too easy. I would have liked more of an ending with the characters who enlisted Kinsey's help in the first place."
3,They can't all be good????,"I'm reading the series in order. This one disappointed me.Kensey checks out the background of a neighbor. On the way out to buy oven cleaner, she ends up in Dallas and later Ky.The story line is unbelievable and well out of the realm of possibility; I probably would not have finished it except I'm committed to reading the entire series."
1,Turn on the radio!!,"I don't ususally trash an audiobook but this one left me wanting to listen to fingernails on a blackboard instead. The reader does not do hillbilly accents well, the plot was ridiculous and the quality was bad (I had to continually change the volume). Please stop. This one hurt."
2,A Bad Joke,"It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory. This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel. Skip L is for a Loser."
4,L is for Lawless,I have read or listened to everyone one of the alphabet series and always look forward to the next one. I travel a lot and these tapes have brought me a lot of entertainment on the road. Judy Kaye has an amazing voice.
1,wrong!,This place will ship you something different from what the picture looks. I called they handled the return process ok. buyer beware!!
5,Looking good!,I received these wheel covers and became overwhelmed at first when I read the instructions. But it took me all of 7 minutes to install them. They look terrific. My car actually looks like it's worth more now. I will write an update after using them for a month or so.
5,Looks great. Stays on tight.,I could not be more pleased with these caps. I used these on a 2002 Kia spectra. These are replacing the ugly fake wire spoke hubcaps the previous owner fitted. These really helped the appearance of this car. They feel solidly made and attach securely to wheels. Best of all is the price.
5,look as good as the stock covers,Bought these for my daughter's 2000 Civic. They were well packaged and installation was easy. The quality is great and my daughter is tickled pink with how they look on the car.
4,New look,I was very pleased with the wheel covers and shocked at how easily I was able to put them on by myself. I am a true girly girl and it was not that difficult to put them on myself.
5,Replacement Wheel covers,Wheel covers are great. Just as advertised and cheaper that two used original covers.
5,Nuty Professor,Jerry Lewis is a fantastic actor and comedian. In this one he shows just how well he can play both sides. Stell Stevens is bad either.
3,great movie..fair dvd,"buying the nutty professor was somewhat of a disappointment..the color is great..the sound in 5.1 is okay but not great..but my major complaint is..where is extras that should be here. no deleted scenes or outtakes..this is one of jerry's all time great movies..i know outtakes exist because i've seen them. also where is the directors commentary?...i believe this is his first film to dvd..for us who love it..it would have been so wonderful to know what went through his daily filming and what problems or relationships developed on making this great movie..i have a feeling maybe down the road you'll see a special edition. it would be so nice..so if you can wait, maybe jerry will do justice to his fans on this great film..."
5,Jerry's Masterpiece,"""The Nutty Professor"" (1963) remains one of the comic masterworks of the past 50 years. It's certainly Jerry Lewis' best film and perhaps his best performance. Jerry's portrayal of Professor Kelp/Buddy Love is superb. As a director, Lewis shows remarkable style and timing. There are many classic setpieces, but the highlight is the Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation sequence that introduces Buddy Love. Jerry also assembled his finest cast, with memorable contributions from co-star Stella Stevens, Del Moore, Kathleen Freeman, Buddy Lester and Howard Morris. The 1996 Eddie Murphy remake - though an enjoyable film in its own right - doesn't come close to the inspired brilliance of the original."
5,That ol' black magic has me in his spell...,"O.K I'm only 17 but i've seen enough films to know that this is my favourite of all time. I love Jerry Lewis, he's a comic genius and I never get bored of wathching this film in particular. The original Nutty Professor totally overshadows Eddie Murphy's version in my opinion. While the modern adaptation was stuffed with crass, in your face jokes, Lewis' creation has a gentle and innocent humour and you care about what happens to Kelp's character.The music scenes in particular are brilliant and the scene where the truth comes out is surprisingly touching.I always had a thing for men in glasses anyway....."
3,Jerry Lewis at his finest,"I saw this movie thru out my childhood and have enjoyed it as much now as I did then. I loved this movie so much that I purchased a copy for a kind friend of mine who has spoken highly about Jerry Lewis' movies but hadn't seen this one. He also loved this movie. Stella Stevens is very sexy yet conservative and wonderful in her role.Someone called this movie a labor of love, I do agree. Thank you Jerry Lewis for making this one-James"
3,Jerry Lewis Almost Under control,"THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is about an eccentric chemistry professor who discovers a liquid concoction which can transform him into a suave character in the style and manner of Dean Martin. For a Jerry Lewis film the antics are somewhat tame. Lewis plays the professor and Stella Stevens is his adoring student. The supporting cast includes Del Moore, Kathleen Freeman and Howard Morris.The movie is saved by the acting and outstanding good looks of Miss Stevens. The Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde theme makes a decent story and the film also benfits from Jerry Lewis behaving almost as if he is under control."
1,Not funny at all.,"I only saw this movie because the Eddie Murphy one was so great, but I was disapointed. I don't hate it because it's so different from the Eddie Murphy version (unlike other people, I can deal with stuff like that), I hate it because it was the dumbest comedy I've seen since Big Daddy! And the ending was the stupidest part of the whole movie! This movie wasted 2 hours of my life, but I have to look on the bright side, at least it didn't waste 2 and a half hours of my life, like Armageddon!"
2,Pretty book,The book is a good coffee table book but not much help as far as info on making homemade natural remedies. Nice pics though
4,Not the classic Al but it's close,Not as good as his classic Hi work of 71-75 but it has enough flashes to be a very good album. Back Up The Train is the highlight but almost all other songs are nicely done. Al is not nearly as polished as he would become but his talent is too good to not to shine through. It's neat to hear the early work of the greatest R&B singer of all-time.
4,This is really a good book,"I picked this book up basically because of its cover, and I hadn't read any fantasy in a while. (Yes, I judged the book by its cover!)The story is unique and written, although at a pretty base level, very well. I could hardly put it down. If you're looking for a good fantasy book that is different than others, this would be worth your time. The edition I got is in British English, but that doesn't detract too much from it. It is good enough to where I will be purchasing the next two books in the series."
5,Great Product and Great Music,"Book was in fantastic condition for a great price. If you enjoy music, this is a great musical to get into!"
5,Great travelin' music!,"My first CD in this collection was the Hymns, and I was pleased to find more albums in the canon. (Purchased at a store in New Orleans. My credit card company called me to verify due to the mastercard melt-down!)The arrangements are delightful. I particularly like the layers of texture...one player will take a solo, and the other instruments add variety behind it. As a long-time concert band musician who's used to playing only what's written on the page, I like hearing players who are obviously having a lot of fun. And as a tuba player, I tend to turn up the bass when that instrument solos. (Warning: don't ride in my car.)Get the whole series, whether on download or hardware."
5,PRETTY AWESOME FOR SNOW PEAS,"I RECENTLY HAD THE CHANCE TO TASTE IT AND I COULD NOT WAIT TO BUY MORE. I LOVE IT, MY KIDS DO AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT I INTRODUCED THEM TO IT LOVED IT TOO. I WOULD LOVE TO TASTE SOME OTHER PRODUCTS FROM CALBEE."
3,Love working with this.,"I have made several movies out of old pictures & home videos for family & friends. They are a big hit & I love doing it. This software is kind of hard to figure out on your own. You just have to play with it for awhile. It is well worth the $$$. I know there is still tons more to learn but all in all, GREAT product."
4,Great perspective from THE MAN himself.,I really enjoyed this book. I am a die-hard Bill James fan and this was a great read with plenty of in-depth analysis and research! Great for the true MLB fan.
2,Statistics lie,"Not sure What Bill James was smoking, but his WinShares system is so biased it isn't funny.Get to the pitchers section. See his rankings? You'll find Seaver at #8 and Ryan at #24. Wait a minute...wasn't he saying he needed a system that didn't punish poor teams and over-reward good teams? Does run support (per pitcher, not team) matter? Does being effective over a longer period of time matter?So when I read the write-ups, they seemed like an NCAA basketball selection committee...basically he'll use one set of reasons for putting a guy higher, and not mention those same, applicable good reasons for putting another guy lower.Start by saying to yourself...if the job of a batter is to produce runs (not just HR, BB, bunt, SB), then the converse is true for pitchers...it's to NOT produce runs (not just limiting h, bb, HR, etc.).Read the first half of the book (about each decade) and that's good. His WinShares system is garbage."
1,Bill James Has Completely Lost It.,"Bill Jame's 100 greatest players the NEW list starts around page 358 and reaches peak idiocy on page 360 where he explains that Lou Gehrig wasn't in the top ten because if he and Ruth were so good why did they only win 4 pennants in the 10 years they were teammates. What a NIMROD.Then HE DOESN'T PICK ONE CATCHER IN THE TOP 40.Even worse and probably the most heinous change was the move of Warren Spahn from TENTH, now get this, to 36th. Spahn won his first game at the age of 25. He won 363 games. He won 20 games 13 times.__________________"
1,Mindless Pabulum,"Bill James is an outdated hack beloved only by aging yuppie geeks. His books remind one of Newsweek Magazine's moronic annual ratings guides of the colleges. James's book appeals only to that mindset, the compulsive ""raters,"" the same folks who want to rate the world's great writers, being the Cliff's Notes authorities that they are. Discriminating fans, don't bother."
3,A step back alas.,I'm not the first person to remark that this book isn't nearly as good as the original and I won't be the last. Why? Well the main reason is the whole Win Shares fiasco. Players are ranked based mainly on an uberstat and 5 months later we still don't know how this stat is calculated. James would never have accepted that approach from someone else; why should we accept it from him?Mind you the book is still good. It just could have been better.
4,More information than you'll ever need,"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract;More info than you'll ever need.I bought it for my 7 year old son who eat, sleep and breaths baseball.He LOVES it.It is a book that he'll get more out of as he gets older. Now he's focused on the stats and standings but the bok goes much deeper than that."
4,Did My Mother Proof-Read This?,"As usual, Bill James presents a phenominal book. This particular book would pale in comparison to previous baseball reference materials, except for one slight flaw: Whoever proof-read this must have given birth to a recent new-born, because they were frequently asleep on the job. I'm only going to give one example, because if you read this book as feverently as me, you'll know what I mean: In the 1950's, Christy Mathewson is listed on that decade's all-star team. I'm not sure, but I think he died before this decade began. If Bill James needs people to proof-read his recent publications, I would be more than willing to help out at the minimal of charges. Note the grammatical perfection in this review. Sincerely, Rich"
4,A guilty pleasure!,"I also must admit, I was a bit skeptical of how this movie was going transform. I only decided to sit it through because I was a true fan of the one and only Midler. I just sat in amazement and finally relief as to how well she and her co-stars pulled it off. By the end of the movie, I was convinced I was watching the true Mama Rose. What a true triumph for Miss Divine M. I will never ever doubt the power she has on us, her cherished audience. ""Thanks for the great ride, Miss M, I hope it never stops"" Yoli M"
4,i liked it,"This is the only film version of the movie GYPSY that is somewhat close to the play! I mean the only good person in the origional is Natalie Wood, even she has flaws! But with Bette Midler as Mamma Rose, shes great! Sure, not the best for the part, but good. For instance Patti LuPone might have better! But Ms. Midler gives the best performance of her career I think! And all the co-stars are great defanlty the girl for Louise! But the guy for herby cant sing but makes up for it in pretty good acting. If you want something worth your money with a good cast get this movie! I liked it."
4,A Treat To Watch,"I wish there was a way to combine the singing voice of Bette Midler and the acting skills of Ros Russell in one person and then you would have the perfect Mama Rose. Nevertheless, Midler does a good job although in my opinion, no one can compete with Natalie Wood as Louise. And can anyone top Karl Malden as Herbie? Still this production is enjoyable and a pleasure to watch."
3,Gypsy a good watch,"I was reading a bio on Bette Midler and did not realize she had played Mama Rose in another movie version of Gypsy. I just had to see this film, so I looked it up on Amazon. My first surprise was the vast difference in price for the DVD vs VHS. It was $69.00 for the DVD - Yikes! So I bought the VHS version for about 6 bucks. I just wanted to see the movie not frame it. This movie impressed me as being more like the stage version which I did see starring the late Ethel Merman. I actually prefer Roslin Russell's Mama Rose, however. All three are very talented ladies, but the character of Mama Rose is so harsh and in-your-face. Roslin Russell was able to soften the character up a bit. Still if you like Bette Midler or the muscial Gypsy this is a good one to add to your collection."
3,"For a real treat, skip this and see the Roz Russel Version","Bette Midler as Gypsy! Sounded like dream casting. But Bette Midler unfortunately plays Bette Midler and forgets to truly develop the role of Mama Rose. Bette, who used to be a good actress, kind of gives the role lots of chutzpah but nothing more. Peter Reigert makes an interesting Herbie. For true scene munching and much better musical theatre goodies see the Gypsy with Roz Russel and Natalie Wood. One only need compare the two Mama Roses to see how Roz developed a character , while Bettehasn't developed a character since the Rose. Why do actresses get lazy when they get successful?"
3,Superb play finally in an accurate film adaptation,"The score of Gypsy is outstanding, and the book of such high quality that it could stand alone as straight drama. Unlike the previous screen version (Rosalind Russell starring), this one is true to the beautiful play.Unfortunately, despite Bette Midler's talent in areas where she herself can shine, her voice is not well suited to the score. Of course, anyone would find Ethel Merman a ""hard act to follow"" as Mama Rose, but Bette's voice tended to sound very strained.Acting is better than average for a film musical, and the overall presentation is enjoyable, but Bette's voice being unsuitable to the wonderful score is a disappointment."
5,Great Compliment to Nourishing Traditions!!,Awesome book on the principles of traditional healing foods. This is a great addition for anyone who wants to learn true nutrition and about the great discoveries by Weston. A Price. I highly recommend it!
4,Good Book,"I am a Registered Dietitian that uses a holistic approach to nutrition and I feel this book is a valuable addition to any nutritionists library. Lacks a bit of detail in research areas, but is a good branch of the Weston Price tree."
5,"A delightful, compelling story with thrilling illustrations","This is an absolutely delightful book that opened my eyes about tea parties. I highly recommend it to the parent of any child with a vivid imagination and sense of fun. Emma Buttersnap, the charming heroine, goes on an intriguing journey to a mysterious land (England). Along the way she learns history (Boston Tea Party), botany (all the varieties of tea), arts & crafts (doily making) and more. There's a juicy mystery that kept my own daughter quite intrigued. The illustrations, by the way, are superb."
5,a fresh and informative look at the history of tea,"Tate provides a fun, fresh and informative look into the history of tea and tea parties. The precocious Emma takes us through all the steps of a tea party that should be fun for children of all ages. I bought copies for my nieces who love it. TEATIME is a perfect gift book."
2,Too involved for what I was looking for.,"It's a fine book, but I hosted a tea party for my daughter's eighth birthday and was looking for something fun and informative to read to the girls while there. This was too long and little boring."
5,Awesome...!!!,Bought this from Amazon Market Place after smelling at a friend's place. I just love the fragrance. I got this at a very good deal when I bought it!!
3,"Great smell, too bad it doesn't last long","I got this cologne as a gift from my wife, I love the smell, too bad it doesn't last long! It starts fading out in less than 3 hours.You have been warned!"
5,Bestest scent in my life,"Sean John Unforgivable Man is the bestest scent i never wear in my life. As French I am confused; product from USA I didn't expect it would smell good like that. That's the first time my girlfriend likes totally my perfume, she is very difficult in scent. Good job for Diddy, i did not know that he had the good taste.But shipping to abroad without tracker is risqué. The first shipping was lost."
3,Not what I expected,"When it arrived, I was disappointed. I expected it to be a normal size, but it is a mini book size. The cover had two tears in it and it was wrinkled. I was not impressed. If this had been a gift for someone, I would not have given it to them. It is cute inside, but not at all what I expected it to be. I will keep it because it is a pain to return it, and will end up costing me more money. What I wanted was a Christmas Journal, to write in and add photos to each year. It is way too small, and not at all what I expected."
5,SUCH A DELIGHT!,I had to have it to completer my collection of her books ... they are each one so nice to have. Some are better than others but I wouldn't want to be with out any of her cook books!
5,Christmas Joy,"I enjoyed this little book!! Some really neat ideas to spice up the holiday season. From decorating to party hosting you'll find something new, interesting and fun to do. Its a great little book for finding new traditions and visiting old ones. Its worth a read."
3,Cute. A little tiny 'tho,"I purchased the autumn book and really enjoyed it, so I ordered Christmas Joy. I was tad disappointed to see this was such a small and slender volume. It has the same cute recipes and suggestions but fewer of them. It is also fairly short- only 46 pages. I read it in about 15 minutes.Overalll, a cute book, but I was expecting more."
5,Quintessential Susan Branch,"I always keep Susan's books on my shelf because they are all keepers. Her Christmas book is no exception. It may be little, but it is full of cute illustrations, helpful tips, and yummy recipes. It really puts you in the Christmas spirit. I can't wait to try some of her ideas."
5,Great,Susan Branch books are the best . It is like getting a letter from your best friend reading page after page.
5,looking for part,"I use my pressure cooker every sumner, I have a garden and can vegetables. My problem is I need a new seal for the lid, it keeps leaking water and the pressure does not increase. So if you can recommend a place to order or buy this seal I would greatly appreicate it.Thank you"
3,Easy Computing for Seniors,It is a good book but I was looking for a book for Seniors whohas no experience with computers
2,Computer for seniors,"I was excited about getting the book because there are a lot of things I do not know about the computer. But most of the things it covered the book covered , I already knew. But the seller was prompt in getting the book to me. Pat Harris"
5,Very Pleased With This,"I had a bunionectomy on my right foot in January 2010, and three and a half months later, my foot was still rather swollen. I was finished with crutches, and the medical boot, but I was limping. So I decided to try using a cane. This one's great. Very inexpensive, well-made, and easy to use. I am a former photographer, and the cane is adjustable in the same way a tripod leg is. It's extremely easy to change the height on this. The head is large enough to hold easily, and should fit a variety of hand sizes. I will need a bunionectomy on my other foot next fall. (Genetically, I got crapped on in the foot department!) So I will definitely use this again. If you need a good-quality, inexpensive, easy-to-use cane, I recommend this one."
5,The brutal and hilarious truth,"No one these days does political satire as savagely and as honestly as David Rees, creator of Get Your War On. Be sure to get books one and two, and read the newest strips online on his website as well. He says the things that some of us are afraid to say out loud, and uses profanity at exactly the right time, a la Deadwood. If you want the truth about American foreign policy, the White House, Iraq and more, read Rees!"
2,not to factory specs,"i received this antenna in a timely manner, but my mechanic could not make it work due to it was missing the small ball on end of nylon gear. i had to buy an oem part from Hyundai."
5,Fun Book,"This is a fun book for both adults and children. It is one that we reread over and over and because the text is very simple, even the very young ones can ""read"" it by themselves. (although very young ones may be tempted to put their hands and fingers in the cut-outs and tear the pages.) But it's very colorful and very interesting as each page makes the Big Green Monster go away bit by bit."
5,Great book for preschooler,"Since my son is now 3 his imagination is growing. The cut out pages make the book. It was recommended by a preschool teacher at his school. He is even ""reading"" it to his baby sister."
5,Again Daddy!,"The words expressed by my son upon finishing the green monster book. This is his favorite from Day care and I found it again on AMAZING AMAZON!Juxtapose this story and sparse graphics with the rich graphics of Drummer Hoff Fired it off and it is hard to believe that this is from the same artist. Does it help resolve issues of being scared at night and peeling your fears apart layer by layer? Could be, but I just like reading it to my son at night. And he will ask for it over and over until I see Red, Green, purple, white......Enjoy books with your children daily and nightly. God knows that the schools do not teach them."
5,Exciting and Fun!!!,This is a GREAT book for kids!! My daughters loved it when they were younger. I have given it to many children as gifts as well. Love this author!!
5,Face your fears,"One reviewer said that this may introduce fears of monsters and other scary stuff to a child who hasn't already thought of it. That's the best... because then you don't have to deal with a long term problem, not the easiest stage to face it. Developmentally, they will sooner or later have fears of the unknown.The children I have read this book to have loved it... every one. The repetitive nature of saying, ""Go away!"" makes it endearing to small people, who are learning to predict from page to page. The construction of monster building and dismantling helps the children to face scary things, by letting them face the individual aspects one by one.In terms of plot, plot isn't necessarily important or relevant to very small children. Plot comprehension comes later. This is an excellent book for children who aren't ready for a simple plot and very entertaining for those older children who are."
5,know someone who thinks there's something alive under the bed?,"In addition to the clever paper art, as the monster builds and disappears, this book is great for kids who might have a little fear of a monster under the bed, in the closet or somewhere else waiting for them. It's empowering for them to yell, ""GO AWAY BIG GREEN MONSTER!"" The different face parts ""scraggly purple hair, ""long thin nose"" appear and reappear, and it's great to help teach colors and adjectives. I LOVE this book! (ages 18 months-5 years)"
4,Conquer the monster - by erasing it,"My younger (two year old) daughter picked this out at the library and both kids (older daughter is four) like it. They like flipping the pages and watching the monster take shape, and then telling the monster, ""I'm not afraid of you!"" and making it disappear page by page. My older daughter has had issues with being afraid of the dark and monsters, and I think this book helps her conquer those fears.The book is very cleverly designed with strategically placed cut-outs that reveal more and more of the monster until the middle of the book when, through removing strategically placed cut-outs, the monster disappears feature-by-feature until it's nothing but a yellow page.I will agree with the reviewer who said that the ""very red mouth"" is orange. But that's a pretty small defect. I highly doubt a child is going to develop any red-orange confusion just because of this book.Great for younger or reluctant readers, but also appeals to older kids."
5,Green Monster,This is one book that my child can't get enough of. He has is memorized as to what comes next.
4,It was really sharp!,"While reading this book to my baby, I got a paper cut from the monster's big red mouth with sharp white teeth! Many babies and children with soft skins will read this book and they might have the same kind of experience as mine. I wish this book were made of harder paper without this kind of danger."
2,New Fears,"Our two year old never had any problems with playing/sleeping in her room until this book about the monster with the sharp teeth was read to her in a class. Now she gets scared and yells out ""Monster!"" This has been on a daily basis since exposure to the book two weeks ago. Sure the book ends with telling the monster to go away, but this affirms that monsters exist in the first place. Even though other reviewers have had no issues, based on our personal experience we would caution on reading to the very young."
2,Frightening for my son,"I checked this book out at my library because I thought it was the cutest, cleverest book. When I read it to my son who is nearly three he loved it so much that we had to read it five times through. Later he woke up screaming and crying and is terrified of monsters now. Even though I tried to use language from the book totell him that he can make the monster GO AWAY!, he is still frightened. He wants nothing to do with the book now. I think he is having trouble because we had always told him before that there were no monsters and now he has a strong image of a monster in his mind which terrifies him."
1,BIG GREEN MESS!!!!!!!!!!,I AM A TEACHER AND I WANTED THIS BOOK FOR A WHILE. I ORDERED IT SO THAT I COULD READ IT TO MY CLASS AT SCHOOL. WELL THATS UNTIL I GOT IT IN THE MAIL. THE PAGES OF THE BOOK ARE PUT IN BACKWARDS AND UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW SOMEONE SAW THIS AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO SEND. ANOTHER ONE IN THE REAR FROM AMAZON.
1,Frightening for Some Kids,My daughter and son both found this book frightening. My daughter is a real tough cookie and rarely cries but this book really scared her. I have now hidden it.
1,Scared my kid,Don't own this book. They read it at school. All I know is my kid was never scared of monsters before but now she is. Thanks a lot. Nothing else to read at school?
2,GO AWAY BIG GREEN MONSTER,"This is a 5 STAR book, however there is a PUBLISHER'S ERROR!!! I have taught preschool for 25 years. I introduce award winning books to my young children. This book is so popular that I have worn out five books over the years. This year I began a new program so that each child holds his/her own book. They learn page turning, colors, words, and artists renditions. Here lies the problem big RED mouth is ORANGE. I have to cross the word RED out and print Orange on 20 books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with children; it is educational and a wonderful teaching tool. But BEWARE of the Publisher's ERROR!!! At this time there is no recourse for me, as books are non-returnable."
5,Fear Chaser,I teach kindergarten and have read this book to my class for several years. Every five-year-old and younger child I know appreciates the sense of control they experience over the big green monster while reading this book. This book makes children feel powerful over fears--a very important feeling indeed.
5,Civil War Artwork like you've never seen!!,"If you love to see pictures from a fascinating time in American history, this is your book. The details and the description really put you there to experience what was happening. No flowery, romatic view of war from this guy!! This book providesextra pictures that were not included in ""Eye of the Storm"".Don't miss this piece of history."
3,Study a good self improvement software engineering method,"The book is good, every argument weel written with simple language and lesson tailored. PSP is a good set of processes to use in software development. If you wish to self study PSP it is good but you have to download a lot of material from the SEI website (exercises, workbooks and so on). Humprey write about process extensions but not so much as needed in practice. Also a more detailed description about PSP processes isn't present on the book so you haveto read about on SEI website material."
5,A great value for the money.,"I was extremely pleased when my WATCH CASE arrived. It is a handsome well constructed case where attention to detail really shows. The watch case is constructed of a solid sturdy material that is padded, the dividers are solid and the watches stay in place. The silver locking bracket is simple but attractive."
5,I'm so much cooler than you,"Dead Milkmen were my ""I'm cooler than you because I like this band"" group I chose in high school. The only song I had ever heard by the band was ""punk rock girl"", but I said your typical hard core fan stuff like how much I liked their earlier stuff and compared them to other bands like Frankie's Weiner that no one else had heard of. Did you have to know what you were talking about? NO, of course not. It's all about image. I formed several bands in high school that never played a show. I would put up flyers all around the school and cancel the shows the day they were supposed to go off. I would tell people the club didn't meet fire code. Girls would ask if they could sleep with me to cheer me up. There was a six month period where I fronted nine fake bands that never picked up an instrument, but I had a rock star following. That is why I'm where I am and you are where you are."
3,Missing,"This is really missing ""secret of life"". I mean really they could've lopped off some their numerous ""hits"" ahem and then the collection would be complete. They even made a vid. for that song. it's alwez missing when I listen to this and it would have added production value instead of alot of songs that sound lo-quality. faves: prg, camaro, nutrition, beach party vietnam!, thinnest line"
5,"If you like Future Stuff, this is your book!",Trully Remarkable! The author knows how to write and does it good. If you are a reader that enjoys future tech and future timelines this is unmissable!
2,What ever happened to the Cyrkle?,"Answer: they've been reincarnated as the Hang Ups. The same whispy hamonies, the same insipid lyrics. Maybe they got better with later albums, but this one is OVER RATED!P.S. For those of you who don't know who the Cyrkle -- they were two whimps who put out a third rate Paul Simon song called ""Red Rubber Ball."""
5,A Fascinating look at the icon,"One of my biggest mistakes in life was lending this tape to a friend who never gave it back. This collection gives us (especially in the US where MTV rarely, if ever shows Morrissey videos) a look at Morrissey takeling the art form of music video and he does it excellently. Morrissey is fascinating to look at and watch, these videos give his fans a chance to see him in a new light...I hope they start making it again soon. While he is no where near the artistry of Madonna(Who is?) when it comes to videos, Moz handles these selections with humor and they are a fun trip through his world, where many just concentrate on his meloncholy tendancies. After watching this you might think he is happy or at least not ready to go ""Asleep"" after all."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the finest analysis of modern war and the political and social conventions that influence the performance of men in the field. Like Vietnam that followed, and as with war in Iraq and Afghanistan today, ""This Kind of War"" analyzes the issues and undercurrents that impact politically motivated wars and how they are fought. The lessons learned, and the author's reflection on the issues that shaped the outcome, are invaluable to anyone in a position of military or political leadership today. A must read. Someone get this into the hands of the President!"
1,Not a Historical Document,"While this book as a good read, it is not a historical document.There are no footnotes or a detailed bibliography. The author sets out to prove, with a vengeance, that we lost the warrior ethos before the war and lost the first battles because of it. To do this defames the brave men of Task Force Smith and others. Fehrenbach mentions how the troops ran, but never mentions the scores of troops that repeatedly picked up the inadequate 2.36"" bazookas from dead comrades to have their hand at it. Not the action of cowards but brave, trained, veteran WWII non-commissioned officers in an impossible situation.Those men deserve better than this book gives them.Don't read this book to learn the truth, read it to learn the authors large twist on the truth."
2,a long story,"Shows how disfigured the Army was. Book is much too long as it is a drawn-out story. And, it was the Korean Conflict, not a war."
2,Convoluted Style,"I wanted to like this book as I noted it has been claimed a classic by many past reviewers. Mark Twain one said, ""A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read."" Well I tried, and after about 75 pages, I had to put this book down. The reason? A curious writing style more attuned to an historical novel than serious history. And although some may appreciate this style, I found it longwinded and short on substance. Additionally, the course of the war, in general, is difficult to follow because it is told via interconnected vignettes as seen by lower ranking GIs; there are no references (and many times no attribution at all) as to where the author gained his information or how they fit into the bigger picture. My impression is that the author simply assembled a skeletal framework of facts and filled in the rest with imaginative prose which may be accurate or not. My search for a good study of the Korean War continues..."
5,Gritty and.Memorable,This book will resonate with veterans especially those who wonder why combat earned wisdom seems to be lost between infantry conflicts. One cannot help but question why our military and political leadership seemed to have forgotten the takeaway lessons in 1965 the author imprints powerfully upon the reader. One may disagree with some of these lessons but not the author`s right to draw them for our concern and assessment. An important read.
3,Where is Gen Matthew Ridgeway,Interesting insight into the thinking of MacArthur. Most books portray MacArthur as an Ego-maniac. This book mollifies that perception making him a bit more human. So MacArther thought if he chased the N. Koreans into China and set up defense along the yalu river we'd hold..? Hmmmmm........ Major screw-up in my opinion. General Ned Almond treated with kid gloves. Peculiar absence of Korean War Hero Gen Ridgeway. Ridgeway relegated to minimal references. Very odd. If you have a passion for the Korean War you should read this book.
4,No cd-rom with some copies,"Some of these copies don't come with the cd-rom. All the books on our shelves had the same ISBN # BUT the copies with the cd-rom had an extra ""FREE CD INSIDE"" sticker stuck onto the front cover (cd was designed for Windows 3.1 or 95). If you want a cd-rom - look for sticker on front cover, make sure it's included (page 504) or ask the seller before you buy. This is a great book."
4,surprising for a B&D book,"Depending on your level of skill this book will either be fantanstic, or mostly stuff you already know, but it still works as a great reference manual, it contains such things as min required spacing for floor joists dependant upon span and size, nailing requirements, plumbing, electrical requirements... its a great reference for the beginning homeowner looking to DIY, to the experienced who would like a quick reference manual for spec, rather than buying IBC/IEBC manuals."
4,Good book,Its a great book to give you ideas for how to fix things or how to make general home improvements.
4,Good Book,I am not a handyman by any means. This book gives you the know how to work your way through any home project!
1,Very poor,"I ended up returning this pathetic excuse for a book. I knew when reading the introduction and seeing typos that this book was not published by professionals. Several photos are missing/have placeholders and many of the photo captions are obscured by black boxes that were obviously supposed to be behind the text. So many of the projects assume you already know what you're doing and just need a reminder, and while there's a picture on the cover of someone replacing a doorknob, it's not covered in the book at all. They cover installing a new door, but when the time comes to install the doorknob it just says ""install doorknob."" This book is not at all helpful if you've never done any of this before."
1,Virtually worthless,"For the skimpy amount of information which skips key steps in every process listed, this book simply should not be in print. A far better volume is the one by Creative Homeowner,Ultimate Guide to Home Repair & Improvement. It's the book you really want."
3,An OK Book,"Contents in the book are fine but I was surprised to received this book from Amazon that looks different than the one I saw on the site.The difference: 1) On the web site the book cover is red with white lettering.2) The one I received, has gold cover with black lettering and the cover is installed backward. I have to open from the back of the book to get to the beginning of the contents.......bait-and-switch?..."
5,Black & Decker Home repair hand book,"Excellent for reference. Haven't get anything to work on at the moment, but definitely love it."
5,good book,"I bought this for my son he says its great has tons of good info would recommend it, he loves self help and how to books and has put a lot to practice already."
4,Good Choice,Got this for my son as he'd just purchased his first home. He has used it multiple times already. The photos are helpful and the simple instructions are easy to follow. I'd recommend this as a great gift idea~
5,black and decker complete photo guide to home repair,"I am an old carpenter/repairer/remodeler/preservationist. This book stands out with talent and efficiency, rendering some of the better and best ways to accomplish 350 home repair tasks. I wish I had read it when I was 20 years old. I would have been quite a bit better at what I was doing than I am."
5,Great reference,"This guide is the best DIY homeowners guide that I have read. Many repairs are covered as well as projects that the Do-it-Yourselfer may want to attempt. High quality, color pictures on every page. This particular format is also easy to lay out when you are working!Just watch out for the subliminal advertising for Black-And-Decker tools."
4,Must have.,This book is as necessary to the handyman as the Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book is to the amateur cook.
5,Home Repair/Not Home Improvement,"This is an excellent book if you want to repair just about anything in your home. However, do not confuse HOME REPAIR WITH HOME IMPROVEMENT. This is a book on how to repair already existing fixtures and other items in your home. It is not about adding additional rooms, ""shelves"", patios, etc. No book will cover everything, but for your money, Black & Decker has provided plenty of pictures on every page along with detailed instructions. You have a simple choice, call a repairman every time there is a problem, or learn how to fix it yourself. Which investment do you think is more productive in the long run?"
4,Excellent primer,"I have had this book for over a year now. It has helped me with small projects like changing a light fixture and unclogging the drain to painting and hanging large pictures and an LCD TV, and to remove and plane down my door that always sticks. I have never been particularly ""handy"" but the pictures and step by step instructions are actually really good. The only real downside is that sometimes they expect me to follow from one step to the next with minimal instruction, and I cannot based on my lack of experience. This is far and away the exception, and most times I could figure it out anyway. It has inspired me to take on bigger and more complicated projects and I refer to it often."
2,Not Enough Details,"The book has lots of nice pictures. It leaves out most of the details you need to finish a job correctly. Most of the advice goes something like: ""How to fix a leaky sink: Step 1. Identify leak. Step 2. Fix leak."" Will not be helpful to most people who will purchase this type of book and are looking for detailed guidance."
5,Good enough to hold a conversation,"A little background: the bad news is I didn't grow up with Saturday power tool time with Dad, and I now just bought an old, old house that needs lots and lots of renovations. The good news is that I do like to learn, and after calling a few all-inclusive contractors, I found out quickly that it's much cheaper to do it myself (if/when I find the time).I bought both this and the Reader's Digest. Both are great, as I can cross reference both of them, and the ""instructions on the box."" Further, when it's a job I think that's too big for me/beyond my skill set, I at least have a clue as to what is going on and can have an intelligent conversation with the handyman. Plus, I can pick his brain on his experience on other issues not related, and get check it against what I read as well.Great book(s) for anyone owning a home, and doesn't have the money/luxury of affording a gc."
5,HMFL,"Great book. It is a book that will make it's money back in saved labor cost. Or at the very least, will show you what is involved, before you tear into you house."
3,Too basic,"I don't consider myself a very handy person when it comes to home improvements or fixing items. I used to work on my car a lot though and that may help as I find most household fixes easier than working on cars. I find this book more for an interesting reference guide than actual step by step instructions. I found many more detailed videos on youtube more helpful when doing work around the house. Examples being; dishwasher install, fauces install, garbage disposal install etc. If you are curious and would like something to read in spare time, it's not a bad book. If you'd like to make sure you have dotted all your i's and crossed your t's, I suggest finding different DYI vids on youtube. They'll have more tips and techniques to help ensure your project gets done right."
4,Not a bad book for the price.,"The book itself is supposed to be a ""super"" edition with added insight and pages, but the difference is negligible. Also the book backing that while it is flexible, im not sure how it would hold up over a long time. After purchasing this book and the Readers Digest DIY book, I would have to go with the RD version if I was forced to pick one. Not a bad book overall just not quite as good as the RD version."
2,"Decent reference, some quality issues.",I love this book as a reference. Yes the Internet is an option but getting the information from a trusted source makes me feel better. The only issue I have is with the quality of the pictures. The labels in some of the pictures are missing. Most notably in the plumbing chapter. If you have a decent idea of what you're trying to accomplish this isn't a big deal. If you aren't good with following directions and like pictures you might have issues.
4,"Good book, great photos",Interesting book. Has good photos that guide you through several home repair projects. Many of the projects are very well sequenced using photos and descriptions. Some of them may be difficult to follow. Definitely helped me in getting a good understanding on how to go about home projects.I would definitely recommend for beginners.
5,Fantastic guide!,"Not only does this book have lots of useful, step-by-step instructions but it also has clear and detailed photos to help you along! Highly recommended!"
4,Detailed info on dive physiology & decompression theory,"This book by one of the most published authorities covers scuba and free diving physics, physiology, decompression theory in depth, and has sections on deep diving, etc. It's an excellent source and a ""must read"" for advanced divers, divemasters & dive instructors. The book has detailed references, and is very impartial in tone. Some sections (such as constantly changing dive computers) are getting a little bit outdated as of 4/97"
3,what happened to my review,"i wrote a review of this book explaining that part of the book was very out of date, about 2 weeks ago. can you advise why it was not used?thanks, Peter McKeone."
4,Great in rotation; a bit too much all by itself,"Like E. Becker, I also bought this CD shortly after it was released in 1985, not to play with sub-track indexing, but because I was really into the DMP catalog at the time (Flim & the BB's, Billy Barber, Warren Bernhardt).After listening to the album quite a bit the first year, it didn't get much play during subsquent Christmas seasons, because I deemed the tracks too similar in sound, bordering on monotonous after a while.Fast forward to 1990, when I bought my first carousel CD player, and I began playing the CD more often, because I could randomly shuffle among the tracks on this disc and those on up to 4 other Christmas CDS.Now we're in the 21st Century, with all its amazing digital audio technology. With 4 PCs, 3 iPods, a Sansa Clip and two vehicles equipped with hard disc drives, Music For Christmas is now -- as it has been for the past 9 years or so -- an indispensable part of our Christmas music rotation."
3,Not what I expected,"I have almost all of the books that show Tasha Tudor's world, and this is the only one that was not all I expected. I would have loved to learn more of ""how"" she does things, not just to read about them."
3,Absolutely brilliant.,"I first caught this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel over the summer and I found it to be extremely thought provoking. It dealt with many issues and had what I took as a reference to Robert Heinlein's Stranger In a Strange Land. The main character chooses the name Lazarus as a name you see. Notice in Stranger Jubal considers calling Michael Lazarus at first. But this beautiful story also manages to capture its own innovation and originality. The first thing I think of when I see the opening sequence is the word ""art"". Lazarus learns to adapt to humanity through the books he reads and the singular beings that make him a compound creation. Truly a magnificent work of art. Imagine if you were experiencing life through the eyes of a child and the body of a grown up pieced together from 88 different individuals of all sexes and races for the first time. You'll get it all in this remarkable film that's expected to not be mainstream due to its mature story. END"
2,"This was meh. Nothing special, not terrible.","I tried this on a couple of spots on my couch, hoping that the results were just specific to different levels of wear and tear. The product removed dust and a bit of dirt, but didn't work on tough spots where some elbow grease and warm water are actually needed. Leather wasn't shinny and didn't look ""brand new"" again like many claim, but I can assume that this might do some good in re-moisturizing the leather, who knows. This isn't the miracle I was hoping for unfortunately."
1,terrible company,"I wish I could review this product but the company sent the wrong item, then after I called they sent the same wrong item again and... after one more call they said keep those items and we'll refund your money. When I asked if I was going to get my product, ever, they said no reorder it from another company"
4,Gentle cleaner...may take some patience,"This is a gentle cleaner. Leaves the leather in good condition for accepting conditioner, but it make take some time and elbow grease to remove even basic soil from leather surfaces."
4,Use with Conditioner,"Does not clean well by itself, but when used with the Lexol Conditioner, it gets a lot of deep dirt and old oils out of the Leather. I recommend leaving the conditioner dry for 24 hours, and then applying the Conditioner. Leave the Condioner dry for 24 hours then continue to reapply multiple times, depending on how dirty the leather is and how dry it is. After 1-2 weeks of applying the products, the leather has become very soft and plyable and looks great. These products where used on an imported Italian leather couch, chair and otteman."
4,As,"Good as I remember, as long as I can remember as long as 30years ago.Will reorder more of the stuff"
5,I like this stuff,"This is a great product. I use it in my car, on my leather couch, anywhere there is leather. After cleaning get the Lexol leather conditioner to treat with"
4,Quiet sneak attack......,"Few games give the feel of a true sneak attack like 'elite forces - navy seals'. The smooth graphics rendering and the realistic sounds of the weaponry add to the power of play. Simple to play. Easy to understand the controls. Prepare to be sent through North Korea, Iraq, and Bosnia ...battle with tanks and helicopters and use ear splitting explosives to get through the 10 massive levels of gameplay. Grab a copy of this as soon as you can and get into the action of this high quality value-priced game."
1,UGH!,"I completed this game in less than six hours. The AI is nearly non-existent, but for $4, it kept me moderately entertained for three nights. One very generous star."
2,This game REEKS,"Sure, it's cheap and you get to kill stuff. But, the game is hardly worth the money paid for it. Buy a bootleg copy for 99 Cents. It's worth about that. Sorry graphics, Sorry AI, It's only redeeming quality is that you get to kill stuff, after one time through, it's worthless."
2,It wasn't bad for how little I paid,"This game isn't bad for what it is, an economical shooter, but I hated that the enemy always had a mystical ability to know where you were, no matter how much cover and concealment you had. It didn't really match up with how seals perform, but whatever, it was a run and gun game."
2,Herbal Overload at Breakfast,"I find the recipes feature strange combinations of herbs and fruits, etc. that are more for effect than for taste. The desire to be original should not supercede having the food taste good. I found very few recipes that I would make for guests, even though I love fresh herbs."
4,Interesting Herbal /Fruit Flavor Combos for Breakfast,"I was drawn to the imaginative combinations of herbs and fruits. Some were a bit overpowering when I baked them, so while I recommend this book, I would also say, reduce the amounts of the strong herbs until you are certain you love the flavors.For example, I made the Nectarine-Stuffed French Toast, which had 1/4 c. basil. I liked the basil, but an 8-yr older taster thought it was a little ""weird.""Another consideration is you probably will have to grow some of these herbs yourself, unless you live near a major city with a killer farmer's market. Most of the herbs named simply aren't available in my local grocery, Whole Foods or Fresh Market.Still, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I give it a 4 out of 5 for creativity!"
4,great economical fryer,"simple, straight forward and low priced. this fryer was made for people who fry once a week or less.pre-heat for 10 minutes and you're ready to fry at 375 degrees which just happens to be the perfect temp. for frying most foods. use a splatter screen to catch any popping grease & help control odors.the plastic lid is nice for storing oil for re-use.if you fry a lot, you might want to consider paying more for a model with basket & temp controls etc., however the chef's fryer is perfect for the infrequent fry cook."
1,Why so expensive here?,"Why is this title so expensive here? They're $20 US at the GUE website. The one star rating I give is not for the book, it's for Amazon."
1,way over priced!!!!,"the prices of all these sellers are insulting. you can get the book brand new from the global explorers website for $19.99, i called them and they have plenty in stock!!! will everyone please stop smoking crack!!! will amazon do something to let the buyers beware of lower prices?"
4,Enjoyable,"While this book also offers some great stories and Shaker wisdom, it also has a great reference in the back filled with herbs and what the Shakers used them for. While, of course, some of the herb info is outdated, it's still very nostalgic and interesting."
1,not very helpful,i followed her protocol for ulcerative colitis and found no relief at all. i bought all of the products and her supplements and spent a fortune. many others i know have done the same thing with no results or worsening of symptoms. definitely beware of buying this.
4,"""Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush""","This isn't the instrumental score, but the mostly-vocal soundtrack for this Oscar award-winning film (Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress). It does, however, feature two tracks from master composer Jerry Goldsmith. He's probably best known for the Oscar-nominated score for another fine set-in-LA neo-noir, ""Chinatown."" His work here is quite similar--but with a bit more bite, as befits the cinematic version of a hardhitting James Ellroy text (""L.A. Confidential"" is part of his famed ""L.A. Quartet""). The vocal tracks cover the pre-rock era of the early-1950s (the film is set in 1953): Dean Martin (upon whom Kevin Spacey based his Jack Vincennes character) clocks in with ""The Christmas Blues"", Chet Baker croons ""Look for the Silver Lining,"" and more. Compiled by director Curtis Hanson (""Bad Influence,"" ""Wonder Boys"") and featuring detailed liner notes about each track."
3,"Too much politics, not enough exegesis","I've been working through Prior's commentary on Micah. While the commentary isn't bad, it is distinctly political -- that is, Prior has some very definite opinions on economic theory and constantly ties them to the text. While there are certainly similarities between modern times and the ancient economic abuses condemned by Micah, I think Prior reads too much of his own anti-capitalist sensibilities into the text. And he often does so at the expense of exposition -- for some chapters, the amount of actual exegetical commentary is dwarfed by the amount of modern social/economic criticism.UPDATE: I've now worked through the section on Habakkuk, and it is far better than the section on Micah. The comments are helpful and insightful, and they aren't weighed down by the politics of the Micah chapters."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the previous reviewer-- this commentary is very politically based. I had a very hard time reading through it. It isn't that social justice should not be important for Christians, but that social injustice is part of an even bigger problem: SIN. I think the commentary focuses way too much time on bemoaning modern economic issues and as a result doesn't do a very good job of explaining the passage. I was VERY disappointed, as I've enjoyed other commentaries in this series. (Note- this is only on the section about Micah, I have not read the sections on Joel or Habakkuk)"
4,It answers my long-standing questions,"I read Anne's diary in my long-ago girlhood, and it's haunted me. I knew the Nazis found them in hiding, and that Anne's dad was the only one to survive, but where the diary left me simply didn't tell me enough. Who turned them in? Did Anne ever reconcile with her mother? What did she die of? This book helped me find the answers to those questions, and I'm grateful"
5,Listen To My Hammer Ring,"I was visiting my mother in Ky,and she took me to see Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountains Boys,in Tompkinsville Ky.It was a great night of bluegrass... I bought Listen To My Hammer Ring that night, and think it is just beautiful.I hope that Ralph Stanly II will continue to produce bluegrass music. Keep Up The Wonderful Work! Stacy"
4,Historical Walk Through the Times of Baseball,"An excellent walk through the past with a hint of baseball of the future. Just like the great baseball players of the past, this book takes your hand and introduces you to the great players of the past as if you were reading their diary."
3,"Good enough, Serious Sam goes to Hell","This game is allright it has a few graphical hiccups, but is mildly entertaining it trully is just like Serious Sam except being set in hell or purgatory, whatever."
3,good mindless fun,"this game is great for when you dont feel like thinking, it's a straightforward shooter, sure there are some unlockables but the best part is is that its just nonstop action."
2,Blah...,"Just OK. At best. I expected more, but I guess it makes sense they were in no hurry to get this popular title onto Xbox. Because it has little to offer. Graphics are no big deal. Fun factor is moderate to low. Not much originality or inspiration here either in the design, gameplay or story. But, I want to collect Xbox games, since there will be no new stuff for the old system. I'll probably never bother to finish this game."
2,"""Soothing""","While I personally prefer the other books in this series, I have found the insights helpful. Don't like the cover though, it scratches too easily. The photograph on the cover makes it impossible to take to work. If my boss found out i'd had a drinking problem, i'd lose my job. P.S. I don't find Hazelden's books scolding, straight talk helped me stay sober."
1,More junk from Blum,"Forget it, this is just more commercialism from Blum to follow his other new-age psycho-bable rune packs. This one has ""amethyst"" pebbles inscribed with runes instead of the ubiquitous ceramic rune cookies. If you really want to learn about runes, try one of the other books linked from this page (one that is NOT written by Blum), and make your own runes or buy them elsewhere."
1,wrong item. different from the picture,I returned it. They sent me what it looks like an oil filter. They did twice. I returned twice. Why?
2,Quality was good,i got this for my bird gun when it arrived it was like i said of good quality tryed sizing it up to my gun it just didnt work or feel right i guess like they say one size does not fit all
4,Julia Roberts Combo Pack,"I wanted to do this review so the next person looking at this title will know what they are getting, as it doesn't specify in the listed title or description.This is a boxed set of two vhs tapes:Pelican Brief and Something to talk about.Two different styles, but both I think good. For further reviews see seperate titles."
4,Good Examples of miitary deception in action,"When I first purchased this book I thought it would be a look at modern special operations actions on the Korean Penninsula, I misread the description. It is not about modern special operations at all, however it was a well written history of military deception operations during the Korean War. It was a quick, fun read and offered several examples of special operations throughout the Korean conflict and how they were integrated with the conventional military operations. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Korean war or military intelligence/counter-intelligence and deception operations."
5,The Hilarity of False Starts,"Talk about writer's block. This book parodies that very concept. Eugene Pota, an established writer, now seventy, is trying to write his last great book. The only problem is . . . He has nothing to write about. The story is a unique experiment of what a writer goes through and the false starts he attempts. I originally had an idea similar to this, a book consisting of nothing but false starts, but looks like Joseph Heller beat me to the punch. Well played, good sir. I bow out of the project, respectively. It's a quick read. About 233 pages. Pick it up, you just might like it."
2,poignant last words,"Although Heller's trademark irony, self-effacing sarcasm and appreciation of the absurd are rife throughout the novel, ""Portrait"" is a radical departure from his previous work. A biographical account of a writer penning what he hopes will be his final masterpiece, the protagonist (obviously Heller himself) fears the inevitable descent into mediocrity. The book, unfortunately, is indeed solidly mediocre in both prose and plot, but is imbued with a certain sadness and poignancy. Fans of ""Catch 22"" should not expect a sequel in any form, but diehard Heller fans will nonetheless appreciate his literary swan song, which throws this private author into sharper relief than any of his other novels."
2,"esthetic propensity, no satiety","Richard D. James has truly lived up to the maxim, ""do not throw what is holy in front of pigs"" with this album, a collection of musical tripe. The sublime beauty and genuine fear expressed in Selected Ambient Works has entirely dissolved into a frayed and disjoined anger. His music is genius; but the curse of genius is that mediocrity is fool's play."
1,Does not compare to other releases,"Positively boring plunking on a stupid broken piano with very little of the ebb and flow one would expect from Aphex Twin. Zero impact.If you like +come to daddy+ or +i care because you do+, then do NOT buy this album. You'll be bored to tears.I'm thouroughly disappointed."
1,"Hey Mr. James, How 'bout a buy-back?","After reading all the glowing magazine and online reviews of this album, I finally broke down and shelled out the twenty-five bucks to experience the sonic masterpiece I was promised. I have never been more dissapointed in an album in my life. I can't for the life of me figure out what all the fuss is about. This is an album of random noise that has no form or structure whatsoever. My impression of the creative process involved in the making of this tragedy is a bunch of children being allowed to play with sophisticated recording equipment. I would love to be more technical and give a song by song critique but I can't find one redeeming quality on this album that would warrant a deeper look. It is pure noise without affecting the listener on any level..."
4,Controlled Aggression,"People seem to be polemically divided when it comes to RDJ's new album, and a lot has to do with the fact that he made all of us wait for this one for a long while. It seems that some question the lack of continuity in the album while others question (gasp!) the production quality. But to me, it seems that much of the music on this double CD album comes off brilliantly and perfectly calibrated. True there are other practitioners of drum-n-bass that equal RDJ's technique, but no one still can balance the seemingly chaotic disorder of the beats with something ethereal and finely tuned. The prepared piano (which a lot of reviewers on this site compare to Satie) wafts over the beats like a ghost descending on a troubled house. It's deeply unsettling and beautiful. For much of the album, RDJ sustains the ambience... and the beats, oh the beats! They are savage and sublime in turn, sometimes at once. An accomplished effort."
4,Drukqs delivers...,Those Fukqs at Rolling Stone don't have a clue...This album is great! A very nice collection ofsongs indeed:)
4,Warning! Do NOT play when driving.,"Whenever I listen to an Apex Twin CD for the first time, I feel like holding onto something just to brace myself. Richard James can come up with beats and rhythms so unpredictable, it's like getting hit on the head by a flying object unexpectedly. Nevertheless, this album is a beauty to listen to. One moment it's ambient, and the next it's drum-and-bass. Like the Cocteau Twins, Apex Twin is like an inside joke: you either get it or you don't. Rolling Stone didn't seem to get it, since they gave the CD one star. But what can you expect from a magazine that gives Britney Spears three-and-a-half stars for her 2000 album? (no disrespect to Britney, though) All in all, I recommend this CD to fans of Apex Twin like myself, as well as those who have a taste for hyperkinetic, oddly beautiful electronic music."
5,Love the piano!,I love the two to three minute piano tracks the most on this album. They are excellent.
2,Kinda Suckqs,"There is some amazing stuff on drukqs (Meltphacc 6, vordhosbn, omgyja, taking control) however I keep having to skip through tracks simply because they are just unlistenable. I guess you gotta be in the right frame of mind for them, but I have been taking care of myself a little better these days. I love Richard but this just doesn't even compare to any of his other works except windowlicker (sorry, can;t stand it)... get I care, On ep,surfing on sine waves saw etc...."
3,his last good album?,"This seems like Aphex's last good album. I own 26 remixes for cash, and you can basically throw that one in the trash. Druqk's has some really standout, emotional, tracks of all types. The pacing of this album suffers greatly however as frantic IDM beats are interspersed with slow ambient ""piano"" tracks. Basically, you can't listen to the entire album in one go. Some tracks have me skipping ahead or turning it off. Its not really a classic, and it could have been if he worked on creating a flow. It feels like a singles release with some tracks he worked really hard on, and for that he deserves credit. As a whole it really suffers enough to take down two stars. Musically its pretty good though."
5,DRUKGS,Excellent for any Richad James/Aphex Twin fan or best album if you have not yet been introduced to Aphex Twin.
5,naughty ugly child has a soft beautiful side,"beautifully ugly....This cd reminds me of a Wendy Carlos album entitled Beauty in the Beast. Something about ugly beauty fascinates me, if that makes any sense. It is sort of like driving through New Jersey's Meadowlands on the way to Manhattan... Sometimes the light reflecting on chemically polluted swamps is gorgeous."
3,The Cornwall Conman Cons Me Again,"For all the supposed genius that RDJ is claimed to possess, he sure churns out a lot of so so music. Not content with one CD of uneven noodling, you're forced to wallow through two CDs of rehashed AFX material, padded with RDJ's little minimalist piano diddies that would have sounded fresh in the 1960s when minimalism was cool. This is a very hit and miss affair. Of course, RDJ's misses are better than most hits. All in all, Drukqs is pretty much a trip down memory lane for those that want a rehash of where he's been before. Makes good background music, though."
5,Brilliant!,"Great disc, but one question, why the 'Explicit Lyrics'label when no vocals found anywhere?"
5,The AGE of Drukqs,"In the current wave of horrifying new releases, I welcome this disc with open and eager arms. Richard, I never knew you had it in you. I've always been a bit of a sporadic fan, nosing around Aphex discs here and there, but with Drukqs, I've definitely stumbled upon a gem. TO sum this record in a nutshell, is hard, but I will try........Spontaneuos Combustion??? This might indeed be the definition. However, that might not include the wonderful short tracks of ambient piano, that succesfully complement the total product. Keep up the good work Richard, those of pure electronic heart recognize hard work.........maybe FRAT-BOY SLIM can take a few lessons........UGGHHHHH......Cheers"
3,Decent low cost scope,"I bought this for a Mosin Nagant rifle because I didn't want an optic that cost three time what I paid for the rifle I was mounting it on. The scope works good and has not broken after firing about 100 rounds through the rifle, which means the scope is pretty tough cause the Mosin Nagant kicks like a mule. I have noticed that it doesn't seem to hold zero for more than 20-30 rounds though. It doesn't move much but I do have to re-adjust slightly every now and again. This optic would probably work great on a smaller caliber rifle or paintball gun. If you're looking for a low cost long eye relief scope this will work for you."
4,works well,i bought this for my mosin m91/30 it seems to work well the glass is a little fuzzy at 7x but for this price i cant complain too muchMC
4,A Good Scope for the Price!,I purchased this scope for use on my T/C Encore 375 JDJ pistol and found it to be adequate to this point. I do recommend not using the rings that come with it as they are not the best quality. The scope held up under the the very stiff recoil of a dozen rounds at the range.
1,A bad buy,"I hate to give a bad review but Amazon wants all my reviews SO>>>>, The scope would not hold A zero and was unusable after 3 power, the picture was black. mabey I just got a bad one, but it was terrible and compleatly unuseable. Amazon gave me instructions on how to return it. I had a refund even before they got the scope back. they certainly make it easy to do business with. This is the only item i have had to return to date"
4,For the money,"First thing, toss the crap scope rings that come with the scope (there's a reason they're FREE!) and then mount this optic on the rifle of choice, start blasting! I have this scope mounted on a Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle, and after over 600 rounds, it is still holding up and staying zeroed, I've taken many 400+ yard shots with this setup, and have produced a consistent 5 of 5 hits on a 8"" gong. For the money, this scope is all I could ask for and more!"
1,NcStar Scope,This product is junk! I put it on my Mosin Nagant and maybe shot 20 rounds through it and while shooting the front lense popped off. I tried to put the lense back on but the image though it is now blurry. The scope is now usless. I guess you get what you pay for? I would not buy this scope for any high powered rifle or hand gun. A 22 would probably be ok but who knows?
2,Disappointed....,"I thought that I would give this scope a shot as a cost effective addition to my Mosin Nagant. It took two days longer to arrive than what was stated in the estimated arrival date time.. I can get past that. What I can't overlook is it arriving with a scratch/crack on one of the internal lenses. With the scope on 2X power there is a crack running accross the upper right quarter of the reticle. When you zoom to 3x and 4x power it starts to go away. From 5x power on up to 7x power you can not see the scratch anymore. When I looked at the warranty information that came with it, the manufacturer will allow you to create a claim but you have to ship it back and pay them $10.. really? The scope was only $40. That would be 25% of what I paid for it not counting the cost I would incurr to ship it back. I think that it would have made a good scope had it arrived in the condition I paid for. Very disappointed in Amazon and NCStar!"
1,Wow! Really?,I would love to leave a good post.I would also love to get the scope that I purchased!Looks like we are both disapointed.
2,take time to adjsut,install the scope on the mosin m38. found the ring is too low and hard to adjsut the scope. may be good for handgun.
5,"Sexy, sexy scope!","I put this on my Mosin Nagant M44, and it works pretty damn sexy. Easy to adjust between power (from x2 to x7), came with standard Picatinny rail mounts (low to gun mounts, so you cant see under the scope, but oh well), a shammy to wipe the lens, and see-through scope covers. An all-around great, cheap scope. This is about the best scope you could get for a pistol or scout-style rifle, for the price."
2,product was flawed when opened,"While the scope was a decent bargin for the money spent, one of the mounting rings had stripped threads, and was not able to be used to mount the scope on my firearm. I had to purchase a new set of rings in order to mount the scope. It wouldn't have been cost effective to send it back."
5,Great scope for scout rifle set up.,"I have this on my SKS, forward mounted in a scout rifle style. There is a ton of eye relief so it is perfect for this set up. Easy adjustment with a flat head screw driver and holds it's zero. You cannot lock the adjustments in place but I have not had an issue yet."
4,Perfect for the Mosin Nagant,"Bought this scope for a scout setup on a Mosin Nagant and am really happy with the purchase so far...even though it says AO (adjustable objective) and it really isn't. Not the first time Amazon has misrepresented a product in the description. Not a big deal for me, but something to take note of.The long eye relief is perfect, the optics are really clear and crisp, and the materials feel like quality. My main complaint with this scope is with the windage & elevation adjustments. Honestly, they leave a lot to be desired. They are not ""fingertip"" adjustable by an stretch as you have to use a coin or a straight-slot screwdriver to make the adjustments. Even then it's hard to turn and is a real pain in the butt. The clicks feel a little mushy, too, but not horrible. Overall, it's a good quality scope with adjustments that could be much better, but I still highly recommend it for the price point."
5,Awesome Scope,Crystal clear lense and crosshair. Solid construction and seems like a very great scope that will see years of service. Looks great on my sporterized M91-30. I will definitly buy or recomend this scope to anyone that needs a LER scope.
3,"Uneven Coverage--Except for Terri Lee, Slights the 1950s","This was strong on Terri Lee dolls (9 pages) and on Mattel (13 pages). Though 16 pages were devoted to Madame Alexander, I felt that just two small pictures of ""Cissy"" were not enough; and there were no pictures of the Winnie or Binnie Walker dolls. Most of the MA coverage was of the child-dolls and Alexanderkins.There were only two pages devoted to ""Ginny""--and there were no pictures of Ginny with painted eyes, molded lashes, or bent knees. All were of the painted-lash version.Karl offers less than 1 column (about 100 words!) on the prolific and highly collectible Virga dolls, offering no pictures at all.The quality of the pictures is excellent, and this is a nicely produced book. But I feel that it does not offer full enough coverage, especially of the hard plastic dolls of the 1950s, to be considered a comprehensive guide."
4,Baby Boomer Dolls,Baby-Boomer Dolls: Plastic Playthings of the 1950s and 1960s. It was given to a relative as a gift - pleased with the contents.
3,Lot's of info- some biased,"This is an entertaining read, and I keep in our guest room for company. It's loaded with information, but some of it was a little biased. I was surprised to discover this unnecessary slant on, what should be, benign information. I wouldn't buy it again. There are too many other ""bathroom books"" out there."
2,American Heritage - How could you?,"Good for those who know next to nothing about American history. For those who associate ""American Heritage"" with quality publications, a big d-i-s-a-p-p-o-i-n-t-m-e-n-t. I waited a long time to see this reviewed - and nothing. Try finding something about Hellen Keller in this volume. (Well, maybe someone ripped out my Hellen Keller page, but I wonder.) If you are a teacher with a wad of someone else's money to spend, this won't be a waste. The broad brushstrokes are fine for those with little or no fundamental knowledge of what makes America tick and how it got to be what it is. But calling this an encyclopedia is a bit ambitious and misleading. The Reader's Companion to American History is much better."
1,carpetbaggers unite!,"The book is as much journalism, as a letter to Hustler Magazine. The authors condemn the colonialistic attitudes of the ex-pat community, while engaging in exactly the same exploitation of the local saps as the suit-clad All-American carpetbaggers they so despise. The authors' political rhetoric is shallow and hypocritical, and their claim to ""real journalism"" is laughable. This poorly written piece may only impress a Midwestern fratboy hoping to score in a poor Third World country on his first trip abroad."
3,"Funny, but not worth buying","Mssrs. Ames, Taibbi and Limonov are sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite insightful. But the Exile is a bit of a one-trick pony, and after awhile it's a bit like a broken record (sorry for the mixed metaphors). You can read the website a few times a get the Ames/Taibbi/Limonov worldview for free."
2,"an inner joke, and not a very good one","This book may only be interesting for someone who may recognize the names of the characters (the authors didn't bother to change them). For the rest of us, especially a student of Russia, this book is useless, as the inner jokes and insults are lost on us. The writing is pretty bad, and the political analysis is helplessly shallow. If you are looking for a real journalistic account of contemporary Russian life, read Remnick."
3,"at times brilliant ,at times really tiresome","Ames' and Taibbi's writing style can be noxious for female readers, but their commentary on the spectrum of life in Russia (which includes all characters - the someones & noones, the Russians & Expats) is really more on the mark than any other articles/books on the same subject. Parts of the book and reprints of articles from the Exile are truly sharp and funny, although the authors are not always as brilliant as they seem to think they are.Can anybody tell me why so much of the book covers their own life history? I mean, who cares?"
5,Very informative,"This book offers a lot to learn and better understanding overall. Great for personal use, gifts, etc. There are some illustrations, and tons of realistic information and encouragement."
1,"The Joy Of Heterosexuality, Written Only By A Man","The glaring problem with this book is that is written only by a man. How can a man, any man, having only male genitalia, know how women feel about sex? Yet the author presumes to lecture from the woman's point of view! It is blindingly obvious that he should have got a female co-author in to complete the job. It's a big and real omission. That said the model couple featured look good and the drawings are tasteful. It's just such a shame that the half of the human race not endowed with willys and balls but vaginas and clitorises are never given expression."
5,Stunning and Classic Design,"I bought the original edition of this book over 10 years ago and was blown away by the gorgeous design depicted in page after page of mouth-watering English country house interiors. All these years later, it remains my favorite decorating book, that I constantly refer to for inspiration. The rooms are timeless. Most were created 20-40 years ago, but good classic design does not date. Although the antiques and handprinted wallpapers, etc., are far out of the range of most of us, the sense of comfortable elegance is one to strive for in any home."
5,I'll help myself,Herman the Helper is brilliant on so many levels. He is like the second coming of Jesus in cute little green octopus form. Look out for the random Chinese dragon!Oh yeah - and Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey are the best children's book illustrators ever.
3,heavy,"I bought this bible for a friend. We are both traveling because we live in Suriname for a few years. I bought this thinking that I was getting him a small bible that would fit in his suitcase when he goes back to the states. I didn't want him to have to leave it behind. It turns out that it is really heavy, and thick, even though the paper is not that strong or well made. It is not a bad compelation of the bible, I'm just disappointed because it is not what I thought that I was buying when I read ""personal size"""
3,NKJV Study Bible Review,Its ok but it is exacally the same as other Nelson study bibles with the same maps and almost the same commentaries. I recommend it if you do not already have a Nelson's Study bible but if you have a different one (like the Spirit-Life Version) do not bother with this one.
2,Poor packaging,"The package was wrapped in Christmas paper, which was all torn up. The handle of the creamer was completely broken off. No bubble wrap used, just newspaper and old tissue paper."
3,love the style,I love the look but wish it were a little smaller to help my mother handle it. at 91 she has trouble getting her hands to hold things
2,1 out of 3 worked,"I had an earlier model of the fantom drive. I wanted a new one so ordered it hoping for a nice replacement. I ordered 2 at once; one works fine. The other had a large part (presumably the drive) rattling around in the case. I returned it and got a replacement. It ALSO had a large part rattling around in the case, but less so. I plugged it into my computer but the drive didn't spin, and it didn't mount.Serious quality control issues."
1,Unfortunate 1 star is the lowest.,"As previously noted, Fantom is kind enough to provide their consumers with a low-cost option for their storage needs. They are able to do this by passing off refurbished hard drives as new items.My 200GB external hard drive failed yesterday. I opened the enclosure and researched the model number printed on the label to learn a company MDT is the vendor of the actual hard drive and they ( quote from their website )""Our products are refurbished using OEM equpiment. Products from this process meets original OEM standards.""So, I warn all who are tempted as I was by the low prices of Fantom Drives. You are NOT buying a NEW product."
1,Lowest quality of drives + 0 customer service,"I bought Fantom drive a year ago. When I read about noise in the reviews I decided that it wasn't substantial, but when I got the drive I was shocked.Regardless, I didn't want to deal with returns and decided to stay with the drive - this was big mistake. The drive worked in On/Off mode - some days it responded, some days I couldn't even access it unless it was rebooted multiple times. It slowed my system and yet (lazy me!) I kept using it, until it died exactly 14 months after purchase.Tried contacting their support - useless.Save yourself time and learn from the lessons of others."
1,In a word: Worthless,"I bought the 2TB version of this drive as a backup drive to hold video files that I was not using while I was editing other scenes for a project I'm working on. To date the drive has erased itself twice. One time when the power was accidentally pulled (reasonable) and one time when there was no power or USB even connected. It erased every work file I was using for an entire film project that will now all have to be reassembled by hand. Luckily the originally the original footage and basic editing files were backed up onto another more reliable WD hard drive so not all is lost, but this worthless hard drive has now cost me an extra month of work. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ANYTHING LIKE IT FROM THIS MANUFACTURER."
3,It's ok,"Been a fan of the show for years and was always curious about this book. Finally found it and while it's not as funny as the TV show itself, it does have some funny bits."
4,A good book.,"This book is a good reference text for students of the Geis interpretation of the Tomiki System of Aikido. It looks like it would be useful to members of not only Fugakukai, but also Jiyushinkai & any other organization that uses ""the Walk,"" the 8 hand releases/blends, the Basic 17 & the Big 10. I deducted a star because the line-drawings do not always match the text descriptions of individual techniques.May also be of interest to Shodokan members.Overall, a good book."
4,Aikido : Principles of Kata & Randori,"This book is excellent in technically illustrating some of the more subtle techniques of Aikido, and the budo aspect of Aikido in randori. Much of the Kenji Tomiki's earlier traditional training under founder, Morihei Ueshiba, prior to WWII can be observed in the techniques and in the terminologies used. Most Aikidoists, with over 30 years of experience will appreciate and remember fondly some of the older and more familiar techniques, as well as the original terminology used here. I know, I do.Overall, Nick's book is an excellent manual for the introducing beginners to Aikido concepts and structure. It also makes good reference material for those serious Aikidoists that would like have more of an expanded education into Aikido, and its roots."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I really regret not checking the Amazon reviews before buying this book. To date I have counted over 13 typos, most of them occuring in the Math section. Plus signs are printed as minus signs, graphs are missing captions, and even some of the answer charts are misprinted. There is no excuse for such carelessness in a book whose entire purpose is the make you aware of details. The only redeeming value of this book is it keeps you on your toes!"
1,New math methods?!??!??,"Aside from the errors in the book, I just wanted to comment on their ways of solving a problem where sine is needed to find the correct answer. I dont think sine, cosine, ect would be taught to us if we could always use rulers made out of scratch paper, what kind of problem solving method is this??"
1,"errors, errors","This book contains so many errors on the practice tests, particularly in the math sections, that it is obvious that no one reviewed the questions at all. However, if you are not bothered by this you can get some good practice out of it."
1,Locks up or slows down PC,"I even bought the DWA-652 for my PC and I have had more issues with this slowing down or freezing my PC. These issues may be do to my XP service pack 3 configuration, but really that is not acceptable. It should not matter if I have service pack 2 or 3. It should just work, and Yes I do have the right to have the most current service pack on my PC, Security is very important I install programs and software on many computer networks so I need the maximum security for my computer. This product is not ready for primetime."
3,Not for LINUX,"While in Windows Vista Alternative (XP+WindowsBlinds) is working fine, in Linux Mandriva 2009 Powerpack does not work. The device is recognized by the system drivers but it times out every 2 seconds."
2,Fast but conection drops ALOT,"This card loses network connections CONSTANTLY. I have it paired with a totally compatible D-Link router, all updated drivers, etc. No network interference. It drops the wireless connection every few minutes, all the time. I had to switch back to the built-in one in my laptop. THAT works flawlessly albeit slower."
4,Xtreme N adapter performs well,"I'm happy with this product. Make sure you download the updated driver when you install however. The out-of-the-box driver is OLD and buggy. I replaced a Linksys ""Business Series"" N adapter with this card. On the $100+ Linksys, I would get poor reception (e.g. 36mbps and low signal strength). I get 300mbps and either excellent or very good signal strength with this card in the same home locations. Good purchase."
5,Works Great - 300 Mbps WiFi Connections.,"I use this in conjunction with my DSL service and couldn't be more satisfied. For home use, I have a 24"" iMac which I have connected to an Apple AirPort Extreme base station via built-in ethernet (i.e - hard wired). For work, I have a Toshiba laptop, TWO STORIES UP, and connect via WiFi to the AirPort base station. The laptop is running Windows XP SP2. I use a D-Link DWA-652 notebook adapter and CONSISTENTLY connect at 300.0 Mbps! Both the AirPort base station and the D-Link adapter are built on the 802.11n draft, and work great together. ONE BIG BUT (so to speak)...the 802.11n draft does NOT support WEP encryption. You can still connect with WEP enabled, but it will be at 802.11g-like speeds (i.e. - 56Mbps). Not using WEP has its obvious disadvantages, but the WiFi connection speed of 300.0 Mbps is outstanding."
4,Window XP SP 3 works,"DWA 652 works on Window XP SP3. You need to download the latest driver on the Dlink website instead of using the driver on CD. You have to disable the built in wireless card and uninstall any wireless driver on your laptop. DWA652 works well on my laptop running Window XP SP3 with all latest drivers. I got 100% signal at 300Mb connection! (Remember, read the manual and follow exactly the manual. Otherwise, it won't work!) Don't insert the DWA652 before you install the driver."
5,Good Wireless card,Bought this to go along with the Dlink 655 router. So far so good. No complaints.
2,Not up to snuf,"I purchased two DLINK DWA 652 network adaptors and two DLINK DAP 1522 wireless access points (to go along with my new DLINK DIR 825 router). The wirless N does operate as reliably or consistently and sometimes not at all. I could not receive N band transmissions and DLINK was not able to fix the problem. In addition, the software causes system hangups.What made this experience worse is the long hold times to get a DLINK tech. And, they tell you to try something and then call them back (more long holds)I've given up on these and on DLINK. They are going back to Amazon."
2,No diff then my B-G card,"I plugged theis N network card in, ran the setup and was easy to do so.Running a Dual band Airport ExtreamI get no faster responce times then from this G band network card. Both my internal G and this N card, durring testing, show only 56k speeds. My internal G card, in side my side testing with another similar laptop, was actuially a bit faster.I dont see any reason to buy this card."
3,Does not support 5Mhz only 2.4,It's kinda silly to have a adapter for that that is over 60 dollars that is supposed to be so great that only supports 2.4Mhz. Only buy this if you don't have 5mhz band to choose from and won't because you can get a better one that supports the clearer 5Mhz band for less that does the same with 2.4Mhz its kinda sad they don't specify in larger print that it is only for 2.4Mhz I would of not bought it for so much to use with my new router.It works fine.But the added software does not work well with the windows zero config. I recommend using zero config and the install cd software for the driver which you can get updated from dlink
2,Wrong one,"The wrong product was delivered and the Item being reviewedXtreme N Wireless Cardbus,adapter, Draft 802.11N was not available."
1,"Wireless N ""N for Not""","This will not see the N wireless AP but will detect the G networks, called D-link and they just said it was a defect, after reading a few articles in the groups I wasn't the only one with this problem, some said will not work with XP SP3 and you should downgrade to SP2 ?????Doesn't make sense!!"
2,Photos removed,I am most annoyed that the photos are omitted from the article and that this fact is not highlighted prior to buying. The photos one would assume show examples of stone tools relating to article.
5,"Finally, one-stop referencing for all gardening questions!","It was with great joy that I opened this book for the first time. The book is a marvelous compendium of knowledge for all gardeners, no matter the level of skill. The writing is clear and concise. Subject matter is well planned and pleasing to read. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of this book is the index. The references and cross-references are so complete. I give this book my highest recommendation."
4,a better listen than _bulk_,"a lot more accessible and therefore quite a bit more enjoyable than the monstrous _bulk_, which also happens to be the critics' darling. nothing pretentious here, just rock 'n' roll straight-no-chaser. jack could be the second coming of CCR or something. there's something distinctly fogertish in the way he approaches rock music: with genuine enthusiasm, a little grit, and no frills."
3,Cole Justice,"For the time and money we didn't have, I was very pleased with the finished film. Yes, this type of movie has been time an time again, but I think we gave it a different spin. There are no new ideas, you just try to do them better than the last guy. I think we were successful. I think it is a good story which is about a history professor who acts out his western gun-fighter fantasy in today's world. Or... simple justice done with a modern day western twist. It was my pleasure to write, direct, and play, Cole Justice. I would consider it to be PG-13. Enjoy it. We did making it."
2,Terry Sylvester Complete works 1969-1982,I was told the cd was in excellent conditon and two songs skip. I'm very disappointed.I would like to exchange this cd for one without skips.
1,King of Cool,"What a disappointment. I have enjoyed most of Dean Martin Variety Shows many years ago, when they were aired. He was very popular here in the Far East. So my excitement for buying this set of the King of Cool was a complete let down by the heavy editing done to all the six discs. Even Dean was cut mid sentence many times. After the voice over introduction of the acts in the beginning, and the closing credits showed so much heavy editing of the lost acts. I have always enjoyed watching the supporting acts of magicians, jugglers and variety acts. What happened to them?? A gross injustice to the name of Dean Martin Variety Show. Save your money."
1,king of cool,"Delivery was on time, DVD is in excellent condition, but the content left much to be desired and was like a TV commercial. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone!"
2,A sloppy compendium of slapped-together white papers,"Be warned: I found this book to be very disappointing. There is no intelligent comparison of systems, no high-level insights to help you choose which approach to take. The chapters are mostly advertising fluff and white papers that seem to be randomly chosen from company web sites, or research papers of little practical value. And the figures are inexcusably illegible.A much better resource is: ""Building Relational Database-Backed Web Sites"" and I also recommend ""The Cold Fusion Web Application Construction Kit"" by Ben Forta."
1,A disappointing novel from Jim Webb,"I've always been a big fan of Jim Webb's fiction, so this book was a disappointment to me. While Mr. Webb continues to excel at descriptive prose in his vivid depictions of Saigon cyclo drivers and Bangkok pig markets, the plot in this novel was too unbelievable to give this book any staying power as a piece of literature. Mr. Webb did not take the time to make his characters' connections seem authentic, and the climactic moment in the book is forced and utterly improbable. In the end, this is a cheap paperback thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously . . . and don't buy the hardcover!"
4,a touching plot,Not quite what I have read in his other books but what seems like a closure to a era of fiction that may take him to other areas. Very enjoyable but I found not as exciting as his other novels... We are becoming ancient history but we will always remain young with stories like this.
3,What does George Allen's team know?,"During the mid-term elections, Republican George Allen's campaign attacked Jim Webb for being ""insensitive to women"" and cited ""Lost Soldiers"" as evidence. I ordered the title the same day from Amazon. I read it cover-to-cover because it was a first rate page-turner. By 21st century standards, the sex was tame. The protagonist's code for female relations was traditional, if not old-fashioned. Perhaps the Allen wonks have not read enough books to know the difference between standard attitudes toward us women and those over-the-top. Jim Webb defeated George Allen by a comfortable margin for Virginia's junior seat in the U.S. Senate. Allen and his friends ought to use their newly found leisure to do some reading."
2,Did webb really write this?,"A very disappointing read. After reading ""Fields of Fire"" I had great expectations. There is no story, no characters, and no plot here. Don't waste your time."
1,A disappointing novel from Jim Webb,"I've always been a big fan of Jim Webb's fiction, so this book was a disappointment to me. While Mr. Webb continues to excel at descriptive prose in his vivid depictions of Viet Nam cyclo drivers and Bangkok pig markets, the plot in this novel was too unbelievable to give this book any staying power as a piece of literature. Mr. Webb did not take the time to make his characters' connections seem authentic, and the climactic moment in the book is forced and utterly improbable. In the end, this is a cheap paperback thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously . . . and don't buy the hardcover!"
2,Totally Disappointing,"As a fan of James Webb, I was surely surprised at this slow reading novel. Lost Soldiers is only a history/geography lesson of Viet Nam, Thailand, Hawaii, Russia and Australia that concludes with a predictable and disappointing climax. Let's hope that his fuure work is better than this one."
3,"The Arabat, Moscow, Russia...","While one reviewer claims, ""The descriptions of Saigon, Bangkok, Moscow and Honolulu are as sharp and realistic as in any well-written travel guide,"" I challenge that reviewer or any reader to locate ""The Arabat"" in Moscow. The boldface titular error in the prologue should read, ""The Arbat."" While there is much to recommend Lost Soldiers, such sloppiness mars the work. Is a reader asking too much of a well-paid, lauded author, his editor and his publisher to ensure that place names are correctly spelled? At the very least, they owe such accuracy to the innocents who expose their identities in promotional blurbs on the dust jacket: Colonel David Hackworth (Ret.), Senator John McCain, W.E. B. Griffin, James Bradley, Walter Anderson, Senator Robert Kerrey, and James Brady."
5,The best deoderant I've ever used,Completely odorless and protection that lasts at least 24 hours. I've never used anything better.
1,Black stuff floating in mine...,"I called my brother who has used this several times since I literally just got it in the mail yesterday....I asked him if it was normal for black stuff to be floating around in the bottle (unopened still)...he said it definitely should not be that way. It really looks like black moldy strands floating around (settled at the bottom unless you shake it). Very very nasty. Probably just a defective bottle, I'll be contacting amazon right now for a refund, but I'm posting this as an attempt to make the manufacturer aware and hopefully prevent other folks from receiving something similar.Contacting amazon now."
4,Great natural spray,"For starters, it doesn't make my armpits itch, so that is a huge plus. It has a good smell and lasts about the same as regular deodorant. I just wish it dried faster, but perhaps I'm spraying too much at once. It's not really spray and go, but I guess that is the price to pay for natural deodorant that doesn't itch!"
5,Uplifting and life affirming,Ella Fitzgerald- Brighten the cornerThis is an exceptional CD released by Caital Records and produced by David Dexter. Ella's voice and skillful phrasing and soulful delivery of the melody were as I mentioned uplifting and life affirming. Her God given gifts complimented very well the wonderful hymns that were selected for this one of a kind compilation of faith enhancing hymns. I never get tired of listening to the CD whenever I get a chance to visit my friends house. The CD at $55 dollars is a bit too rich for me to purchase at this time. But none the less it is a great CD and superb performance by the one and only Ella.
2,Two dollar bill about a dollar short,"Woods is getting to be too much of a formula writer. Little mystery; much out of any recent Stone Barrington Book reads as if author wants to have Barrington be some kind of aspriational hero for readers. Woods' earlier books far superior. If I buy any more of Woods' books, it will only be in paperback. Not worth the hard cover price."
3,Not Mr. Woods Best Work,"Some of the stuff in this volume is a little far fetched. He must have a vivid imagination to write this stuff. Stone really likes to eat. I hope he isn't gaining too much weight. I'm one of Stuart Woods biggest fans, and I look forward to reading his next book. Keep writing Stuart."
3,Two Dollar Bill,"Stuart Woods' follow-up in the Stone Barrington crime novels may be a Wonder Bread out of sight out of mind entertainment, but its action keeps the pages turning. My housework had to wait ""just one more chapter."" In line with Mission Impossible type of action, Woods fulfills testosterone fantasies of saving the daym extraordinary escapes, and sexy women. The book reads like a movie with fast moving realistic dialogue. It comes fully equipped with terrorist suppliers, Agency trained warriors on both sides, and helicopter rides, all beginning with a stereotypical Texan. Often, coincident situations seem improbable, but if you are willing to set aside your boundaries of reality in the name of entertainment, go to it. I would like to add one SIP phrase to Amazon's: the CIA agent Lance rarely talks. He drawls. I recommend this book for a quick read to escape the humdrum office or vacuuming or fighting toddlers."
3,A Little Long Winded,"I love Stuart Woods stuff, but this one was a bit wordy. It seemed Woods was trying to fill pages in many cases. He used to much boiler plate to tell a rather simple tale. And was it really neccessary to have two characters named Tiffany? This wasn't one of Woods best."
3,Unusual as a two dollar bill,"Stone is back and enjoying life as usual, till he meets the stranger everyone calls Two Dollar Bill. This is the same lovable Stone Barrington that we have known for a long time, a few twists with Bill keep it interesting. The political comments get tired after a the first couple, but all in all an enjoyable read"
1,Preposterous,"A complete waste of time and money. Unrealistic twists and turns, unbelievable dialogue. With lives in danger Barrington drinks at every opportunity. Anyone having Elaine squat at their table would never enter her restaurant again. Woods writes as though he is as arrogant as his hero. It seems that anyone can switch from one branch of the service to another and join the CIA."
1,First Woods I could not finish,"I've been a Woods fan for many a year. I like his Holly Barker series and I've been in lust with Stone Barrington forever. He's been one of the ""great good guys"" in serial fiction.Not this time out.I could not finish this mess. This is way past ""phoned in."" It's difficult for me to believe Woods really worked on this plot. The supporting cast are no more than cardboard cut-outs of bad guys and vixens, with nothing interesting, quirky, or redeeming about them.I do not know one attorney who would have taken on Billy Bob (the bad guy here) as a client, referral or no referral. There were just too many red flags for a smart cookie like Stone to miss.When Woods brought Arrington (the love of Stone's life) into the sordid mess, I just closed the book and took it back to the library.Woods is better than this. And a solid character like Stone Barrington deserves better, too.Blech."
4,STONE BARRINGTON ** BOOK ELEVEN,"So many weak reviews, come on....If you are a Barrington fan, I think TWO DOLLAR BILL isn't all that bad. Ok, I am a little tried of Lance Cabot and Arrington's drop-ins are more ho-hum especially to the storyline, but Billy Bob Barnstormer is a pretty good bad guy with police, Stone, the FBI anmd the CIA all having trouble with him. This is an ok read in the series, but come on Woods...give a new client free of the CIA. Recommended and series HIGHLY RECOMMENDED beach reads."
2,I love Stone Barrington books - but not this one.,"I had this one figured out by the second chapter. Too predictable and shallow. Hopefully, the next Stone book will actually be worth reading."
2,Woods phoned in another snoozer....,"Sorry to say it, but it's dejavu all over again. Same plot with minor variations. Stone Barington and Dino trade bon mots with Elaine over whiskey/dinner/dessert. Barrington has an attempt made on his/Arrington's/Dino's life. Stone meets and beds a beautiful woman. And finally, Stone saves the day/Arrington/Dino/New York City.I would give this tenth Stone Barrington novel more stars if I could get worked up over the main character. I thought you were supposed to care for the character and worry about him. Unfortunately, Mr Woods must be a bit tired, or preoccupied, because all of his characters, including Stone Barrington, are two-dimensional with no more substance than tissue paper. Mr. Woods, maybe it's time to retire Stone Barrington and move on..."
3,"Stuart, it's time to pack up your computer","This is another Stone Barrington novel. If you like this series, then you'll probably like this novel. But you can do much better. The characters are wooden, the dialogue stilted and Stone's exploits are outlandish. Woods has adopted James Patterson's style of short chapters but unlike Patterson he doesn't pull it off. I just read Lifeguard by Patterson. While it is not great literature it delivers exactly what it promises and is a highly entertaining read. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this novel by Woods. Stuart, it's time to pack it up."
3,Republicans need to be thick skinned,"The new novel by Mr. Woods is fine and enjoyable. It does, however, excell in bashing christians and Republicans especially our former Attorney General andcurrent President. The bashing is relentless. The story is good and fast paced. If you are of a left leaning ideology or are upset over the last two elections this book will be enjoyable. If you are Right leaning, buck up. Don't bother with the book if you are thin skinned."
1,A fourth quartile effort. Not up to his standards.,"Yikes. Woods is confusing - some of his is good (e.g., see ""Prince of Beverly Hills"") but this one is a one-month write. Avoid it.I read and rate 8 to10 books in this genre each month. I rate each book based on a 0-5 point scale. This book rated as follows: Characters 2. Realism: 2. Description: 2. Ah Ha: 3. The Read: 2 Overall, the book ranked 292 out of 368 books."
4,Typical Stone Barrington,"If you like Stone Barrington, you will like this book. Author Woods is a master at creating suspense situations, and then pulling Stone out of them. His writing is terse, minimal and always contains a punch. One of my favorites. Willy"
4,Two Dollar,"Enjoyed the book, Love Stuart Woods and his characters. The book arrived in good condition and have enjoyed the series. Thank You."
3,Bland,"I don't know whether Mr. Woods intended it or not, but I found Billy Bob Barnstormer, the bad guy in this book, to be substantially more interesting than the hero, Stone Barrington. He is smarter, more clever, more resourceful, more agile and almost more likeable, except for his prediliction to murder others. The story is borderline testament to the axiom that crime CAN pay---as the result of ineptitude on the part of those who are supposed to prevent it from paying. The good guys spend most of their time blandly fighting with each other, devising schemes that don't work. The non sequitor is that Barrington wins."
3,Safe and Steady Stone,"The endlessly witty Stone Barrington is back! In his usual unflappable way he has found himself yet again embroiled in someone's criminal endeavors. Will he never learn? We hope not! With the help of his good friend Dino, NYPD, and his not-so-good friend, Lance, CIA; Stone must try to determine just who the flashy billionaire Billy Bob Barnstormer really is and what is he trying to do? Why is he passing out two dollar bills like he has an endless stash (earning him the nickname ""Two Dollar Bill"" - hence the book title. Hardy-Har)? Why did he leave a hooker in Stone's guest room? Why is he being tracked by the Justice Department, NYPD, Army, and CIA? Perhaps most important, why is he trying to kill Stone? With more questions than answers this is not so much a who-dun-it as a why-dun-it and Woods keeps you hanging on to the very last page. As ever, you will be impressed by Stone's resourcefulness, quick wit, and luck with the ladies."
5,"Woo Hoo, I'm a canner!","As my garden get's bigger, and my freezer space shrinks, my wife and I decided to learn how to can. This canner is big. Gauge and valve work as advertised. Was kind of intimidated, but the instructions walked us through it. Just opened jar of hot peppers and onoins I canned back in July, and got a nice resounding POP of the vacuum release. Should be doing the fall carrots soon."
3,"Christmas Gift, some assembly required","Got this for my daughter, the gauge had to br attached, which means for safety she should have it checked by the county extension before using. Seemed flimsier than mine too. Let you know if it blows up this summer."
5,Pressure Cooker/Canner,This pressure canner came very well wrapped and secured. It is beautiful and I love the little instruction booklet that came with it.The last canner I bought had a big ole book that was complicated and I never did figure out how to use the thing.In this new canner booklet each fruit or vegetable has its own instructions giving time limits and pressure amounts. I have already successfully used it twice.The book also explains care and replacement parts options. It even told me how to protect my stove top. I am very pleased with this pressure canner.
2,Some Original Recordings Some Are Not,Always review songs and albums before downloading. Some of these songs have been re-recorded by the original artists. Let the buyer beware.
5,Advertising Bible,"...i'm not often a blesfemous man but this book IS Advertising Bible. you know nothing about advertising till you read THIS. it's a humane but yet frenzy and straight-talking study on how you SHOULDN'T make advertising; what often made mistakes to avoid. once you read it you go, ""...so that's what advertising is all about. can't wait to get started..."" now i often measure advertising(mine, others') by what would Bob say about it. hey, if you won't read this book you ain't never gonna know what advertising really is."
3,Really Good Book,"While I wanted more information from this book on a historical level, the recipes here are pretty good and I have tried 2 so far, we shall see what comes from it!"
1,How has it survived?!?!,"In looking for a good, solid contact management program, I was drawn to ACT!. For personal use, Outlook was fine, but when it came to managing my business clients and contacts (the core of any business), Outlook wasn't sufficient. So I thought I'd take advantage of the powerful features that ACT! pitches.Bottom line: Save the money. ACT! might be powerful, but it's hidden underneath a clumsy (VERY) interface and poor coupling with Outlook. In addition, its limited feature set proved the ultimate downfall, as I was unable to use ACT! as my e-mail client because their limited settings do not suffice for my advanced e-mail setup.I suppose for basic contact management, ACT! would work. For someone who wants to spend less time managing their contact management program and more time managing their CONTACTS, I recommend you steer clear of this product."
1,WARNING! - $70 Upgrade Rebate Is Not Valid,"On the page that offers the full version of Act! 6.0 there is a link to a $70 rebate for people who are upgrading. Because the rebate form requires a UPC code to be cut out and sent in, this only applies to the 'CD' version of the upgrade software. However, the rebate form limits the offer to four different UPC code US versions and two different CDN versions of this product. When I received the upgrade package, the product's UPC code didn't match any of the UPC codes on the rebate form. I returned the product.If you are purchsing the upgrade version, you won't be able to use the $70 rebate."
4,It's a lot better than ACT 2000,"I'm not an experienced ACT user, but recently have been converting to it. I'd been using ACT 2000, which I purchased a while ago, with Windows XP and Outlook. I was completely frustrated - the Outlook integration for email was awful and ACT was buggy with XP - constant crashes or freezes (and that's not common with XP). Now I'm on the free 30-day trial of 6.0 and it is a vast improvement. Email with Outlook works way better; it's actually usable! So that in itself is worth it to me. I just placed my order for the program. I haven't used enough of the other features to give it 5 stars, but it's worth the upgrade."
3,Upgrade only if you need the new email capabilities,"I upgraded from ACT 2000 because I needed to be able to send out email mailings to my customers in HTML. ACT 6 does do that pretty well, so I'm pleased I went ahead with the upgrade. But without doubt Interact has introduced a lot of bugs into the product -- I guess they lost most of the programmers who knew the program when they bought ACT from Symantec. The email program itself is buggy and will only work for me if I have Outlook running as well. Also, very frustrating, is that the wordprocessor driver crashes after one use, so I can only create one document at a time then I have to reboot. Their support site doesn't seem to have a solution for this.Apart from rewriting the email system, there is very little that's upgraded from ACT 2000, as far as I can tell."
1,If not ACT!; Then what?,"I am in excatly the same boat; Since 1993 using ACT! (when it was good for it's time) (sending faxes, letters, etc from the contact), and waited for the new millenium up to date with e mail, but it does not work.So, If not ACT!, any suggestions for an alternative? I have 14,000 database, and use it to group, send a newsletter via email, and a susbscription (print labels and manage subs) of about 8,000.Any ideas?Thanks"
1,How can the software developers sleep at night,"I was stupid enough to be drawn into the hype marketing of the fabulous upgrade features of ACT 6 and had planned to use it to its full capacity. Since putting our 14,000 plus contacts database on the server just 2 months ago, it has completely corrupted twice, lost valuable data, corrupted my outlook twice, constantly stops reponding and wasted the equivalent of about 3 weeks work trying to fix the damn thing. We try to use the database to a reasonable capacity only to be stopped at every turn. I spend more time navigating the service website only to find more and more ridiculous bugs that have not been addressed. The latest recommendation was to exclude Norton anti virus from checking any database files - a dangerous practice that has not improved the performance in any way. Good luck anyone who has enough patience to persevere with this waste of money, resources and time."
3,SLING,"Good product which I feel will last some time. I do wish they had a little better instructions but overall, mission accomplished!"
5,clear and lucid commentary,"This is Master Nishijima's translation, with commentary, of the _Shinji Shobogenzo_, the collection of 301 koans that Dogen Zenji brought back to Japan from China. Nishijima's commentaries on the koans are quite clear and specific, something which I greatly appreciate. The commentaries to the koans are anaylzed in light of master nishijima's ""three philosophies, one reality"" system, which lends itself perfectly to these cases. I highly recommend this item.Information on Master Nishijima's ""Three Philosophies and One Reality"" system of interpretation may be found at: http://www.dogensangha.org/about.htm"
4,vERY ENGAGING,"THE CHARACTERS OF THIS BOOK ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE. THE STORY DRAWS YOU IN TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED. IT IS HARD PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, AS I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW THE AUTHOR COULD BRING THE STORY TO IT'S CONCLUSION. ALSO, THE THEOLOGICAL,PHILOSOPHICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE CHARACTERS WERE SOMETHING I CONTINUED TO PONDER AFTER FINISHING THE STORY LINE."
4,I had a hard time putting this book down.,I spent the day on the couch reading this book. There are very few books that I can't put down when the sun it out. The suspense held my attention. The social aspects of the town believeing in Wayne was an interesting thing to overcome for Joe. The integrity of Joe is something we need more of. Read it - you'll enjoy it.
3,Good overall story but....,the ending was too abrupt--the alternate ending was not any better. I am a fan of this author but she really needs to put more time into the final chapter after writing such an interesting read. She must have gotten bored towards the end.
1,Doorstop from a Closed Group,"OK they wont tell you this but everyone giving it 5 stars is a member of this very exclusive group. They believe they are the only saved people and if you ever accepted Jesus into your life through a prayer or experience you are deceived, lost and going to hell unless you let them study the Bible their unique way with you. I was in this group for over 15yrs (I know I should have left it yrs ago but had so many good friends I thought we could help change it from the inside...I was wrong)and most of these studies were done by people with ZERO Bible Education (OK maybe a few classes here and there in college) This is a shallow swim on deep subjects. Save your money and buy some better material from real Biblical Scholars."
1,Beware of this handbook!!!,"This handbook was created by the Bay Area Christian Church which was formerly known as the San Francisco Church of Christ. It is part of a cultic group known as the International Churches of Christ. They believe that members must submit to their church leaders in all areas, that their group are the only Christians saved (they will deny this but it is commonly taught & believed within this group) and they abuse members by berating anyone who expresses dissension in their church. I was a member for 10 plus years...I know this firsthand .....beware!!!!"
3,Good handbook,"It's exactly what it says it is, a handbook. Its a good source to refer to when studying out the scriptures, doing a devotional, desiring to learn more, grow and be different. What I like about this handbook is that it provides alot of scripture references to specific life issues as well as suggested practicals. It is not a subsitute for God's Word nor does it claim to be. The handbook is simple to use, which makes it useful for almost anyone wanting to add to their bible knowlege, grow in specific areas of their life and more."
5,Great book!,"This is great book about how to apply the principles of the New Testament to the 21st century. Whether you're single, married or a family with kids there are great illustrations about how to use the Bible in practical way. Also, the book will challenge the reader to explore their personal relationship with God in a faith-building way."
5,the best computer speakers so far,"i had this maxwell speakers and really believe me they ROCK! very clear and sharp sound, the woofer sounds perfect, laud and wide, you can plug em to any computer or notebook, even ipod, can take them everywhere!i definitely bought them again, actually been looking for some but can find them anywhere"
5,KsE Are Still Strong!,"Don't read that guy's review underneath mine. Killswitch Engage still have it, even though they now have some members from Blood Has Been Shed. Even if they did get nominated for a Grammy, they didn't win. This band is not sold out and you know it. Sellout bands are Green Day, Linkin Park and Hoobastank. I hate it when people say that Killswitch Engage collapsed.Anyways, this CD is a classic for the heavy metal generation. This CD was released in July of 2000, when ""nu-metal"" was the big thing. No one knew about them then. Even if a lot of people know of them today, they can still shred it! ""Temple From The Within"" and ""Vide Infra"" are two examples of classics off this great CD. Every track is brilliant. Buy this album, along with the other two albums. ""The End Of Heartache"" may have some cheesy lyrics at some times, but it's the music that counts. Buy every album from Killswitch Engage. They will grow on you."
5,heavier kse,"Man,comparing kse in their early days to now i just gotta say they were way heavier and better.Yeah since jesse left they haven't been that good anymore end of the heartache was a cool album but the newest stuff is kinda weak,howard is not that good of a singer jesse was wayyyy better.Get this one is pure heavy metal unlike their new stuff this is something you can actually rock to GET IT THEY WON'T BE HEAVY LIKE THIS ANYMORE!"
5,Great,"I loved this CD, it was just as good as Alive or just breathing except the production wasn't as good. But why hold that back on such a great band. Can't wait till their 3rd CD."
3,good but not great,"Gave this a 3 because of the music, the vocals give it a minus 2 since they actually distract from the awesome music.This was a good starting album but it just misses melody. the music is kick ass the entire way threw, now take away the vocals and you have a great instrumental album but the vocals leave you wanting something you can understand, it's like listening to someone gasp for air and then spitting on a microphone for an hour. hey if you're into that then by all means go spend $15 on it but if you want something with some melody and alot better vocalist get ""The End of Heartache"". Such a great improvement not only vocally but also musically, they made the perfect decision getting the new singer, not only can you understand the new singer when he's screaming his lungs out but his voice during melodic parts is great."
1,Weak,"Far from real metal and more like close to nu-metal and rap which is realy sad. There's no technicality and heavy? No, i mean, this may be heavy to people who think korn is truly heavy or whatever but if you listing to extreme deathmetal or grind-gore you'll know that kse isn't a bit heavy at all. Get the latest album from mastodon title""leviathan"" but don't bother with any album from kse because they just as bad as nu-metal and rap and pop music. When you see nu-metal kids and kids that like hip hop started to enjoy your music and yet you think you play real metal ?Foget about it ! Not recommended."
5,Great...,"KsE Also Have A New Drummer but anyway this CD is Great, not as good as Alive or just breathing but buy it anyway its Hardcore & they dont even need to swear. WEST COAST IV LIFE .:W:."
5,awesome cd buy it!,"well first off ot that guy who gave killswitch engage a bad review, he's freaking retarded if he thinks they suck, and proably deserves to be shot, this a an awesome album."
4,good cd!,"First off i cant believe what the real metalhead from ohio said, Everything besides killswitch on Roadrunner is Nu-metal garbage?he must not even know whos on roadrunner, What about Cradle of Filth? Obituary? Chimaira? Deicide? Are you out of your freaking gord man? Why dont you go check roadrunners roster on their website, all kinds of ""real"" metal bands on roadrunner.To the cd, best tracks are Rusted Embrace, Vide nfra, Soilborn.Very good album overall, not enough of it though."
5,I love this band,"K.E is that 1 band that saves you when everything is the same.Coming out in the era of Korn, Limp Bizkit and Reveille, Killswitch is the complete opposite of those bands, and this cd is just the starting point of metal from a very talented band."
2,Passable for a first album,"2.5 stars. There a couple of cuts that are pretty strong but they aren't enough to carry the album. Overall, this CD is on the weaker side of o.k. The songwriting isn't really there (but you've got to cut them some slack; this is their first album). They stepped things way up after they got their current vocalist; whoever the guy on this disc is, he would have definately held the band back. Save your money for their newer material.Not recommended."
3,eh kinda meh,"not the best band out there. Gotta remember they are nu-metal. Not much talent here. Vocals are not bad, would be nice to hear less screaming. Have to agree this is not very heavy at all. For some heavy bands check out slayer, megadeth or napalm death. Killswitch has some potential and i hope to see something better from them in the future"
1,Another generic bullsh*t...,"Killswitch engage?You guys are horrible and try actullie playing, realy heavy not softcore, ok ? Killswitch engage's slef title album is softcore and they actullie, rip off (...). I don't recommend. I sat down in my car and listing to all the albums from killswitch engage and well...It was a huge waste of time. I dont recommend."
4,Not to be Missed!!,"A strong story, highly readable. The author has drawn his characters with vivid imagination and has written an exciting and absorbing story which I'm sure will delight and impress most readers."
3,Fast Paced Thriller,"Awkwardly phrased sentences interrupted the flow of dialogue now and then, but these missteps became easier to ignore once the story gained momentum. An interesting premise was made believable without a lot of technical details. The one thing I found unbelievable was that the police would allow a civilian to participate in trapping one of the killers. Still, a fast and interesting read if you can suspend your grasp on reality for the length of the book."
3,"interesting idea, but not convincing","Like most of Wilson's novels, Embryo is based on an interesting idea that is not really developed very much. The basic scientific idea of out-of-womb birth just serves as a backdrop for a not very convincing action story, that reads like the script of an average B-movie (but not as good as his Extinct). Clearly, Wilson is unable to copy Chrichton's successful blend of believable science, human interest and action. Nevertheless, it makes for a nice quick story that's perfect for on vacation."
3,"Not bad, not great","This is a by the numbers, short, fast reading thriller. The story sucks you in but then it starts to get a little too cliche and begins to drag by the end. I did like the ending though. A famous model/actress wants a child but is unable to have one herself. So she does what every normal person would do and hire a private investigator to research a Dr., who's last known where abouts were in Mexico, she heard about from a friend who may or may not be able to birth a child out of womb. If you can get past the fact that someone would actually do that, the story is actually pretty good."
4,BABY MAKER,"EMBRYO is one of Wilson's best novels, a story about modern science's attempt to birth a baby outside the womb. Once science fiction, now fact.The story centers around a beautiful model who wants to have children, but doesn't want to lose her beauty. She engages a bail bondsman to investigate rumors of a brilliant scientist who has been able to do this. He mysteriously disappeared after natives set fire to his lab in South America.Wilson weaves a pretty involving story with interesting characters and plot developments. Recommended."
2,Too trashy to be gripping,"The subject of this book is very interesting, and the story engages at first. But it tries too hard to keep the pace going, at the expense of credibility. It's also let down by poor writing in many places. Subjects like this need more insightful treatment, and less schlock horror. And strong writing wouldn't go amiss either. Sadly most of the other medical/bio-tech authors I've come across, don't provide this either. Or maybe the publishers think that to get a mass audience a thriller needs to be dumb. Pity."
3,Entry-level instruction,"This workbook of proofreading exercises is designed to be a classroom supplement. Without a teacher offering clarification, some of the punctuation guidelines are unfathomable. For instance, one of the usage rules for the apostrophe is: ""to indicate the plural form of words referred to as words."" That one took me three days to figure out: e.g., No if's, and's or but's.The material is geared toward high school students taking an introduction to typing or composition, so that they can improve the readability of their work. The proofreading exercises are fine for correcting errors within a given text, but the answer keys don't show how to mark the margin for a typesetter.I would not recommend this book for someone looking to become a professional proofreader. Peggy Smith's Mark My Words is much more comprehensive in that regard."
2,"Not a survival guide, but a study guide","I purchased this book becuase I administer several WinNT 4.0 servers of varying size, cost and importance. I wanted... no wait... needed a book that would accomplish what the title says - A SURVIVAL guide, (i.e. There is a problem, or a situation, or a request, and you need a reference to help when you are clueless).THIS BOOK IS NOT SUCH!I have looked at this book countless times and not once did it provide an answer. I am not kidding here, it really helped me 0 times.I recommend Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows NT Server 4 if you need an answer to a question or problem. It has never failed to provide an answer.I read the other reviews of this book and it suddenly became clear to me, this book is probably better suited as a study guide for budding MCSE's as opposed to people actually supporting live NT boxes. Since that means it probably serves a useful purpose, I will upgrade my 1-star rating to 2-stars."
5,This is a house bible,"Alice Waters, in an interview, explained this book as indispensable, so I bought it. It is a bible for any thoughtful person whom wants to make a better life!"
5,A must read!,"This and Catherine Dunne's ""Interior Designing For All Five Senses"" are no less than must reads for people wanting to stay a step ahead going into the next millenium."
4,a patatern language,"This is an amazing book for anyone interested in building, remodeling or buying a home. It points out basic tenents of architecture that go across cultural lines. It is easy to read and retain."
5,NOT ONLY USE TO BUILD A HOUSE BUT ALSO YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.,"THIS BOOK WAS USED FOR OUR TEXT BOOK. AT FIRST TIME, I THOUGH THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH MY COURSE, BECAUSE I STUDY HRD. AFTER I READ WHOLE BOOK, I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. WE CAN LEARN A LOT OF THINGS FROM THESE PATTERNS."
5,What's more to be said,"Even if you're sold for deconstructivism, minimalism, etc., have the time to dig this out. The structure has the rigour of a technical book, and the content is synthetic enough to make you feel you actually learn something here. You can absorb a great amount of information in little time because the patterns are strongly tied together so you can relate them to one another easily. Highly recommended."
5,A must-read for all who live or work in buildings,"This book changed how I looked at homes, workplaces, and public spaces, and more fundamentally, how I thought about my life in relation to the larger community. My new perspective led me to discover the cohousing movement, and to my current residence in an evolving ecovillage. Whether you're an architect, a big-city planner, or just looking to renovate your kitchen, this book is an invaluable guide and inspiration!"
5,Why did my teachers never tell me about it... ?,"When I knew a ""A Pattern Language"" and ""The Timeless Way of Building"", I thought... Why did my teachers never tell me about it when I was a student... ? It was almost seven years ago. Fortunately, now I'm a teacher and I'm committed my self to do as much as possible in order to encourage my students to read and put into practice those wonderful books. Rene Ariza, architect, Bogotá, Colombia, South America (reneariza@hotmail.com)."
5,Good for All,This book should be required reading for all citizens. This text lays out a comprehensive approach to a meaningful built environment.
3,"Yes, but a bit analytical","As a professional designer, I tend to approach books that purport to reveal the secrets of good design with skepticism. Although I can't say that I disagree with most of what the book says, the author's attempt to explain principles of good design relies too heavily on analytical reasoning.Good design stems as much from intuition and talent as it does from a methodical analysis of the problem. The most talented designers, writers, composers and artists rarely exhibit analytical personalities; they rely instead on an intuitive understanding of how to solve the problem -- in other words natural inborn talent combined with many years of practice and experience.This is mostly a book that will appeal to builders and engineers who dream of being architects, or programmers who secretly want to design user interfaces. Unfortunately, the book doesn't deliver any insight into the most important thing -- talent."
4,Corridor of Storms,"Again, Sarabande's gripping, vivid imagination captivates the reader. The continuing saga brings Torka, Lonit and Umak to new lands East into the rising Sun, finding a valley of endless game, gaining family members and taking shelter withing the protection of a new clan.Evil masquerades as Navakh; Shaman/Magic Man. He is only as powerful as his intimidation will lend.. which is grand because of new taboos he creates among these naive people. Along with this madman, another evil lurkes within the hearts of these people as they hear the blood curdling screams of a creature none has seen but all fear, except Navakh.Non-compliance results in being sent out from the clan. Do or die, this is the endless journey for Torka's band.I keep asking myself, what more could happen to these people..? On to the next book.."
2,cane corso sign,"plastic, looks cheap and the lettering was scratched off when i opened the package. it took forever for the item to arrive and when it did i was disgusted with the quality.will not be ordering again."
5,An honest and most promising debut,"Sand In My Teeth is quite the unputdownable, fascinating and refreshing book that I have read in recent times.I thoroughly enjoyed the lighthearted style with which the author raises larger issues and makes the reader pause and think. The tone and tenor of the young protagonist matures with each consecutive chapter and as the novel progresses; layers are peeled off the main characters with the help of richly defined secondary characters and incidents."
2,Confusing & not very informative,"I got this book thinking it would actually explain the birds and the bees to my daughter. No such luck. Because it's all in rhyme, it doesn't really make much sense to a small child. And it gives trivia without explaining well how babies are actually made. Example: it tells you that ""a male octopus captivates/the interest of intended mates/by changing into shimmering stripes/which pleases even the shyest types...etc. etc. How do they actually mate? It doesn't say. If you're looking for a cute little book that could spark some conversation, this is it. If you're looking for a book that is heavy on factual information that will teach your child about the birds and the bees, look elsewhere."
3,cute but no answers,"Sweet drawings and somewhat informational (if you are interested in the process of seduction in alligators, spiders, sea horses, and many other animals). But virtually no information about humans. For example, a page has a sperm and an egg cell, but neither the text nor the drawing tells where the two are coming from. Anything about sexuality is hidden behind rhyming text and caricatures of animals. While it's not a bad book to have (my 4- and 6-year-old enjoyed it), it doesn't provide any answers for a child who asks questions."
5,I liked it!,"Well, after reading the Amazon reviews, I wasn't sure about this book, but got it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. No, it's not all about human reproduction (although that is mentioned in there). We have ""Where did I come from?"" for that, and that does an excellent job. This instead shows how a lot of different animals reproduce and truthfully, I learned some things. Plus, the illustrations were really cute and didn't take long to read. I really liked it and the kids liked it too."
4,four and one half stars for this fantastic debut effort.,"there is a quiet containment in the whole flow of the radar bros debut release. guitar chords roll along rhymically like gentle waves, their beautiful simplicity and spareness shaping the songs into jewels. within is a distilled quality, as if gravity is pulling the music into its overall form and all unnecessary elements are filtered out in the downward pull. an exquisite record. a fantastic group of tasteful musicians."
2,Disappointed,"I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture."
3,Star Warts,This item was purchased as part of a personal collection but appears to have the same issues as reviewed by 2 other people. Poor packaging. I'm continuing to hunt down this item without the packaging problems.
4,Good Quality,"The Quality is good for the new one. I have no idea, how long the rubber ring can use. I buy a new one, always the old rubber ring failed, the new ring was not fit the cooker, even through, I bought a new ring from same manufacturer."
1,never used it,"I can not really evaluate this, because I have never used it. Took it on our sailing boat but never needed it"
1,Totally Disappointed,"I brought this item looking at its high ratings. It didn't take long to find out what was wrong with this cooker.The first time, it didn't blow any whistle. I thought maybe I had put less water in it so that it couldn't build enough pressure. Second time it was worse, I filled the water, careful not to exceed the safety mark and closed the lid. Soon, water droplets started coming out of the edges. Thinking that it'd stop soon, I let it go. This time, the steam started coming out from the edges and more heavily from between the handles. It burnt the food and didn't pressure cook it.I'm returning this product within a week of buying it."
1,"terrible pressure cooker, don't buy","Don't buy this aluminum pressure cooker! It is really a bad pressure cooker.I use this cook to boil water first before cooking any food. The color of the cooker changed from beautiful shining silver to dirty silver with some stain that I just could not find ways to get rid of it. Then I use napkins to wipe the outside of cooker , the napkins turned black. I returned this terrible pressure cooker immediately."
1,terrible,Okay it says eligible for free super saver shipping wrong I had to wait two weeks. The inside was dented in from when the previous owner must have over tightenedthe handle. Now I could've lived with that and the loose handles but the best part is that the locking mechanism mkes it so you can not even close the lid... I understand I bought it used and wasn't expecting the best piece of equipment but I certainly didn't expect to recieve one that didn't even work.....I have now also waited two days with no response from the company about me returning it. UGH!!! I'm not one to write bad reviews I like to brag about the things I get but don't want another customer to go thru the same bs they put me through!!! Be warned!!!!
1,crack gasket returned,"The gasket had a crack when the cooker was received. Since that's the thing hold the pressure, I did't want to take the risk to try it, so I shipped it back to amazon directly."
4,cooking with Presto.,"I have had no problems with the pressure cooker so far. The six quart size is big enough for a whole chicken. The package comes with a few recipes which are a good starting point, especially since cooking times for different kinds of meat are provided.My main issue is that all the ingredients in a recipe will be cooked for the same amount of time, so that some of them will be overcooked. A workaround is suggested. Items like vegetables which take less time to cook than the main meal cooking in the pressure cooker, can be prepared seprately in the normal way, and then added to the rest of the meal. A few minutes of cooking will then blend in the flavors."
3,Only for occasional use,"The Presto 8 quart aluminum pressure cooker is not designed to withstand regular (>1x a week) use. I've learned since using pressure cookers for work that aluminum pressure cookers fall apart quicker and aren't as consistent as stainless steel versions. The handles will need reinforcing and expect the seal to wear out quicker as well. If you intend on using pressure cookers, avoid aluminum.Also, watch: [...]"
4,Good Quality for the money,I am very please with this product. I had never had one before and was not sure how to work one. But it was so easy and had very good instructions. I was surprised (and so was my husband) that my first roast was so tender. It cleaned up easy also.
4,No-Problem Cooker,"I have been using this cooker for over a year now, my recent purchase being a second and repeat purchase. It is actually a no-problem cooker and requires no attention at all. Except the lower handle, whose screw could become lose after few months and keeps demanding some action with the screw driver, the cooker is virtually trouble free. For the money I paid, it is a great purchase. As you would see, I have bought a second one."
5,Great Pressure Cooker!,"I've used many pressure cookers and this one is the most reliable one!Sturdy, easy to clean and cooks everything quickly & evenly.This 6-quart is a wonderful size when preparing meals for 3-5 people."
5,The biggist problem with the old pressure cookers,"My Presto pressure cooker is about 40 years old, and I love it. It seems that they never wear out, except for the rubber seal in the cover. I recently had to buy a new one, and it cost about $12.I think I have bought 3 seals over the years. I don't use the cooker very often though, maybe twice a month, only because I use other methods of cooking for a change.Presto says that one should remove and clean the seal after each use, but each time you do this, it stretches a little, and fits less, and less into the lid. My seal doesn't wear out, it stretches out.Now I just leave it in the lid, and wash it like that.I do spread some cooking oil around the contact points on the seal, and the pot each time I use it, so the cover can be removed easily after cooking. If the seal sticks when you remove it after cooking, that also stretches the seal somewhat.Again, I wouldn't be without a pressure cooker, it's great to have, and Presto is a top brand.Bighunk"
3,decent cooker for a decent price,"This is a decent pressure cooker for a decent price. It does have a few short comings especially if you are from India and want to cook rice and dal on a regular basis. The cooker does not whistle like one expects from cookers sold in India, if you can overlook the whistles as an indicator of doneness this cooker will serve you well.over all, we are satisfied with the cooker and have started tracking time instead of trying to rely on whistles."
5,Love it,"While it's not the highest quality pressure cooker I've ever owned, it performs just as well as the more expensive brands. I have a family of 5 and I've used it at least 3 times a week since I've bought it and absolutely love it. It's simple to use, works well and while I considered buying another so I'd be able to pressure cook more than one food at a time, I'm able to cool most foods so quickly that I just put them in another dish and pressure cook the next thing - all in minutes! Great value for the price."
5,love to cook,"love cooking in my pressure cooker, cook a chick in few minutes for soup, or a roast love love it."
4,Presto 6-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker,"Very nice pressure cooker. Gets the job done. I'm used to the old-school thick, heavy pressure cookers my mother used. This one is much lighter, but it still seems to heat evenly. Definitely glad I got the 6 court size instead of one of the smaller ones."
2,"Its true, the bottom gets grey/black after single use","My family has use pressure cooker for many many years, we decided to upgrade our older aluminum one, which was extra heavy, too heavy.. So we decided to upgrade to a smaller model, this 6 qt looks just right, but the problem is after a single use (cooking pork stew), it became black/greyish on the bottom of the pot, you can't clean it.I think they use very cheap coating for finish that it doesn't actually prevent any staining. The older models that I used which was also aluminum material (but twice as heavy as this pot) never have this sort of black/grey stains after 10 years+ of use.Anyway, I returned this model and went on to purchase the stainless steel version of 6qt, I hope I have better luck with that one.Good thing Amazon sells this product, at least I don't have to pay for return shipping."
4,Wonderful Cooker,"What can I say, the aluminum pressure cooker is just as good as my stainless steel one. It is very easy to clean, and is versatile. I have an 8 quart Stainless Presto pressure cooker that is just too big to use for just two people in the house, so I purchased the 6 quart aluminum model. Presto continues to live up to their high standards. I was so impressed with this cooker that I have ordered another one for my niece!!"
4,Roomy Pressure Cooker but not a canner,"First, I contacted the company and YOU CANNOT can with the this cooker, despite what the description said. I told them that the description said that you could and I was not happy about it.However, I do like cooking with it. I had a 6 quart before and I love having this bigger one. Overall, I do enjoy this product, just mad that I can't can with it like is says."
5,Fabulous,"I have owned and used two Presto pressure cookers that are now over 45 years old. Ordered this new one, used it and absolutely love it. It cooks much faster than my old ones plus it is lighter and easier to handle. I definitely recommend this item for anyone looking to purchase a pressure cooker."
4,problem with handles.,"I like using this pressure cooker, the helper handle is very useful for moving and removing pan from stove top. The size is perfect for three people. Everything works great.....except the handles are just slightly out of alignment with the body and lid of the cooker.I was able to tighten the screws enough to be able to use the pan for now. But tightening the screws further (as they work a wee bit loose from use) could easily strip the threads on the pan itself. I called Presto's customer support line. They were very pleasant but said all the handles for this cooker are the same, offered to send me new handles, and said this issue would be sent to engineering dept. I imagine I will be ordering new handles in the near future, since Presto offers a lifetime guarantee, perhaps this will work out fine."
1,HARD TO OPEN AND CLOSE,"I tried over five times to open and close the pressure cooker. After much physical pressure and twisting and turning it finally opened. When closing the same process. As an owner of several pressure cookers for many, many years, I've never experienced this before. The product will be returned. This is very unusual for a presto, I own many of them. Never had this happened before."
3,not bad = not made from stainless steel,"well, it is not made from stainles steel that's why it is cheaper but it works as it should. Vegetables left some light stain inside (unlike the stainless steel one), there is NO steamer basket included (unlike the stainless steel one) and it is not polished everywhere (unlike the stainless steel one). Other than that it does what it is supposed to do."
4,Good quality but needs to be carefully cleaned,Good quality and enough size for cooking beef and chicken.The rubber ring in the lid is a little bit dirty.
5,Excellent Purchase,"In case you are planning to get a cooker of this much capacity then just go for it, no second thoughts !!"
1,too thin I think,"This didn't work for me, and I think it's because the aluminum bottom is just too thin. Anytime I got the temperature up enough to pressurize it, it burned on the bottom, despite me adding more liquid than the recipes called for. I could have spent $10 on a burner ring, or just gotten a more expensive model. If you are into it, I'd recommend looking for a heavier bottomed stainless steel model. But I was pretty disgusted with the whole transaction by then. I'll stick to my crock pot for convenience cooking and on-to-stove pots for everyday."
4,Good pressure cooker,"Every thing is great from pricing, shipping, and using the product.The only thing I did not like is the pressure regulator that is just a piece of loose metal that sits on top of the port. There is no string or any place to put this regulator. If you lose this piece, your pressure cooker is just a pot."
5,I like it!,"I am relieved that my new pressure cooker performed as I expected. My old one has served me well, but recently developed a couple of problems. But the new one was easy to use and gave me just what I wanted and expected. So I am pleased and glad I made the purchase."
5,good,"It is a good pressure cooker, but it is too large for serving two people. If you want to serve two persons , consider choosing a smaller one."
2,Do not put in dishwasher,I put this in the dishwasher and it turned black. The inside looks like it was severely burnt and scratched. I will probably toss it out. Wish I would have bought stainless steel as I cannot return it because I pitched the box. Maybe I should have known that you cannot put aluminum in a dishwasher?! Other than that it worked fine for the one time that I used it. It should have come with a warning about the dishwasher.
3,Decent,"This pressure cooker is decent, but the beans and meats keep sticking to the bottom more than I care for. I've ended up going back to mostly canned beans in a pot."
4,Happy with the purchase,"Bought this to replace prestige cooker we had for 5 years. This little different in the way it operates compared to our old prestige cooker but does the job. No regrets, so far, on this purchase."
5,Love It!!!!!!,This is the best purchase I have made in years. Well worth the money. Saves time and saves money. I'm in love with my pressure cooker.
4,Still the best,Presto cooker still the best as far as I'm concerned. I have owned 4 or 6 pressure cookers during 45 years of homemaking. My new pressure cooker lives up to its reputation of being one of the best pressure cookers on the market. Just love it!
1,lid does not slide to main pot to lock,"Hi Mr Seller, although i read the reviews of customers complaining abt not being able to slide lock the cover to main apparatus, i still bought it and there it go. After trying for 40 min to get the lid close to main cooking pot, i finally gave up. I don't know if its the lids problem or the fitting is not right. Suggest me what should i do before i return it back to you."
1,Totally did not work,"I have an old Mirror pressure cooker that needs new seals. I decided to buy a new one instead of rebuild the old Mirror. The new Presto lid was poor. I tried for 30 minutes to close the lid to no avail. I took the gasket out and tried some more, with very difficult success. I sent it back and will just use my old one."
3,Quality problems ...,"I used this pressure cooker now for 6mo or so and the pan shows discoloration quickly. We mostly cook beans in it. I think that this is due to the use of aluminum that reacts with the food, so not really a manufacturer problem."
5,Great Product,"This is a great pressure cooker, not only for the low price, but for the value you get for your money. Presto continues to make a terrific product. The aluminum heats quickly making it easy to brown your meat for full flavor. Easy to use and quick cleanup. I could have gone for a more modern version of the pressure cooker, but stayed with a name my mother and grandmother used. Glad I did."
5,works great,"This is our first pressure cooker and we think it works great! No more all day slow cooking, this takes far less time. The only down fall is I like to cook BIG meals and this doesn't have the capacity."
5,Fantastic value,This pressure cooker has done everything as advertised. It feels very sturdy and well built. Would recommend this specific model for people trying to save money and get a reliable pressure cooker.
5,Love this Pressure Cooker!,"This is a great tool to have in the kitchen. I'm glad I bought this Presto cooker from Amazon. I couldn't find a better price anywhere and after using it I'm wondering why I didn't purchase one sooner. It's easy to open and close, easy to use and easy to clean and saves me a lot of time in the kitchen. No matter what I'm making, it comes out cooked to perfection. Just follow the instructions in the little recipe book that comes with it and you can't go wrong. I made a pot of dry red beans in 8 minutes, brown rice in 12 minutes and Sirloin tips with gravy in only 11 minutes! This is a great little cooker! The only problem is.....now I wish I had two because it's a pain to cook the sirloin tips with gravy then clean out the cooker so I can make the brown rice. If I purchase another it will be a Presto! It gets an A+."
2,Cooks great.... just dont ever clean it!,"I was so excited to cook artichokes in 12min! and they where amazing. The whole family loved it. The only problem is that it says ""dishwasher"" safe for the pot and hand wash for the lid. So i followed the directions, soft dish soap warm water. I ended up with a tarnished mess after washing the pot. I returned it to the manufacture as damaged. So unless you never have to clean it..... its ok."
5,great product,it works like a charm. i am still using it. The meat comes out soo tender that the fibers are totally separated. love it
5,Presto comment,it really saves me cooking gas and time to cook even the toughest meat ever. I just love your product to be a part of my kitchen appliances. Thank you Presto.
3,Warning about elevation!!!,"I ordered this cooker/canner in hopes of being able to pressure can my vegetables. Unfortunately You cannot use this as a canner above 3,000 ft elevation. I live at 4,600 ft. What a bummer. Restictions like that should be posted in the Amazon review or somewhere noticeable so that those of us who live at higher elevations won't get stuck with a canner we can't use."
5,The writer's struggle,"Recently I was fortunate to read ""Technical Style"" and I enthusiastically recommend it. As one who has struggled for over 50 years with writing, I have collected several books on writing style and doubted at first whether a new book could offer anything new or useful. I am delighted to say that my doubts have been washed away--I am a believer. The book is clear, imaginative, precise (I learned this is an asyndeton). Chapters on how to present equations, tables, and graphics are particularly useful. Every chapter has something that will be helpful in the daily struggle."
4,Great for meditation,"I think this book was excellent for meditation. I enjoyed all of the exercises and everything was really easy to follow. I was so excited about the book I thought I would venture out for a reading. The reading wasn't very good at all. I think Stacey is good at capturing your feelings in the future but not so good at actual predictions and details of her predictions...but buy the book, it's worth every penny."
1,nothing new in this book,"There is nothing new in this book that hasn't been written about in a thousand books before it. A mishmash of new age fluffy bunny mixed with rehashed psychic information that can be found in books as far back as you care to go. Lots of stuff from the 60'and 70's mixed with all that new ager stuff that started popping up in the 80's and 90's. Also the book is off putting in it's arrogance, as well as being erroneous, in regards to how the author's generation is somehow more gifted psychically by somehow being ""preprogrammed to be more psychic"". Give me a break. What a bucket of utter hogwash. There are other, better books in this genre to spend your hard earned dollars on, don't waste it on this one."
1,Too Late to be of Use....,"I had tried to purchase this when it had been in hardcover only, and it would always be missing pages of text (doesn't say much for the company). When I saw it was finally in stores in paperback (and complete for once) I purchased it, only to discover that Ms. Wolf's humor was severely outdated and that ""psychic development exercises"" would be more suitable for teenagers. Her writng was boring, tried to hard to be humourous and was too self-centered."
5,The Best of Ella,"If you like Ella and/or vocal jazz, this is a must-have. Her phrasing is impeccable. I keep reading reviews about Decca this and sound quality that...blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is whether of not you like the collection of songs and if the artist speaks to you. This CD is beautiful--- no artist can capture the essence of a song like Ms. Fitzgerald. If you want a good, mellow jazz CD by one of the greats, this is a fantastic one to choose. It's my favorite Ella and I have most of them."
5,WICKED BOOK,I really enjoyed this book. It was really good. I enjoyed the movie as well. Although the movie was almost nothing like the book it was still good. They made a good choice picking Angelina Jolie to play Gia.
3,Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia,"This book is more than a biography. I bought the book to better understand Gia's life after seeing her movie. I expected to read about her life. Unfortunately, the author Stephen Fried was too devoted to the minute details of the fashion industry to stay focused on his subject. This is an insider's view of the fashion industry from the 1970s-1980s; Gia was merely an example of this life. It's obvious Fried spent hundreds of hours researching his book. Unfortunately, he didn't spend the necessary time editing the superfluous information out of his book. In a 25 page chapter, he seemed to mention Gia as an afterthought in the last three pages. Gia didn't come into greater focus until the 13th chapter of the book. (The book only has 18 chapters!) When Fried did examine Gia's life, I was impressed with the vivid insights he provided. Yet if he had cut out 100 hundred pages from the 403 page book, it would have been a tighter and more enjoyable story."
5,Remarkable,"This book really went into depth about the life of Gia. The author did a great job painting a beautiful picture of a gorgeous woman who rose to fame overnight and vanished in a blink of an eye.Gia didn't really have a strong woman figure in her life, until she met Wilhemina. Once Wilhemina die, Gia lost her soul.This novel is inspiring, heart-breaking, dark and touching. It really shows how you can have all the success and money in the world but it doesn't buy happiness."
3,"Tragic life, Worse death","One of the saddest books I have ever read. Gia seemed to have it all, looks, photographed great,travel, money etc...everything but the love and stability you yearned for.She died destitute, and people from the modeling world still did not know of her death until months afterwards.Friendships are fast and fleeting in the modeling world. The super models who came through unscathed seemed to be those with very close family ties such as Christie Brinkley and Cindy Crawford. They had genuine friendships outside the modeling world. I think her mother was protecting her from the awful world of the tabloids. What a picture the beautiful Gia, dying of aids. It would have been all over the world.A good read for any aspiring model and her family to read.She died because people just didn't care enough, as long as that perfect shot came through."
4,A Shockingly True Account,"I have always been interested in modeling ever since I was younger and after reading this novel by Stephen Fried, I have a few very different opinions. First of all, the book was quite long and at times very drawn-out. There were pages when Gia's name wasn't even mentioned and Fried went on about a specific photographer or hair stylist for page after page. Still, the basic story about this tragic, young beauty is captivating and it was very difficult to put it down, once getting past all the irrelevant details. If you are interested in not only Gia Carangi but the fashion industry of the 70's and 80's, then this would be an ideal read."
3,Can get VERY annoying....,"OK great book i have to say that .... but I recall that Fried referred to the fact that Gia was not interested in every little fashion ""minutiae"", so then WHY WHY WHY must the author have to write about every little ""minutiae"" that ever happened in the fashion world!! I thought this book was supposed to be about Gia! Yea it's good but geeezzz all the detail can become very draining and throughout most of the chapters I'm wondering, ""and what was going on with Gia during this time?????""..."
3,"Tragic, fascinating story, bad writing","When reading this book, I found myself wanting more about Gia the girl, Gia the woman, and unfortunaltely 2/3 of the book was about events and people surrounding Gia. If you want to read alot about David Bowie mania, the ugly buisness of modeling, and the New York fashion scene in the 70's, then youlle like this book. But if you're like me and want to know more about what Gia was feeling, about her personal struggle, then don't expect to be told her story thru her eyes with this book. This book seems to detail more about the lives of others that have touched Gia's life than the details of Gia's life itself. It seems like there was so much to Gia, that the only person who could of made her story come alive is Gia herself."
4,Fascinating story of a sad life,"In depth look into the sad life of a beautiful woman. Gia truly was a thing of beauty, and her life was tragically too short."
4,Full of details.,"The book is simpy better than the movie since the author included many details about every step and stage in Gia's life. The reading style is easy to follow, too."
1,CAN I GET ONE BOOK ON KINDLE NOT RIDDLED WITH MISTAKES?,"This review is not about the actual content of the book, Thing of Beauty. It's about my frustration with the amount of errors and typos in every Kindle book I have ever purchased. (In this book, there were lots of missing periods; sentences just ran together with only a capital letter to indicate a new sentence.) Apparently it doesn't bother anyone else, because the book publishers/Kindle do nothing about it. It's a sad commentary on our society. Period."
2,Going Down Fast,"Her wild ride to fame and the beautiful life have not yet struck.Life as a wild, Philly, lesbian, teen with Bowie fantasies that have not yet been fullfilled is all Gia has to date.So far a somewhat interesting read.Have not yet come to the heroin years or the aids and death.Mostly reading and learning about the business side of the modeling industry."
2,I can see why this dvd is only $1,"I, too, bought this dvd at Walmart for $1 and thought, what the heck, it's only $1. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent workout that will leave you sweating, as long as you keep up with the poor cueing.For one, it's very misleading. The dvd isn't 60 minutes as stated on the back of the cover, but only 50 minutes. 35 of those minutes are the ""dance"" part while the last 15 minutes is toning with upper and lower body and stretching. The dance portion is broken up into 3 segments if I remember correctly: salsa, funk, and disco. It made me laugh because to me, the exercises she does, isn't really a dance. For example, I hardly classify doing the ""sashay"" a salsa routine, nor would the ""grapevine"" be considered disco. She also makes the comment about doing these routines out on the dance floor. Unless you want to be laughed at or made to look like a complete idiot, save these ""moves"" for the privacy of your own home."
5,A Little Extra Sun,"A very nice collection of music on this CD. Megan Slankard has a very nice voice and enjoyable back up music. She plays the guitar and sings, which is also a bonus for me. Each song is different and has a story going through the lyrics that make the songs fun to listen to each time."
4,Time travel by guitar,"If your reading this and only want the ""wou hou"" song from KILL BILL and phone commercials then your in for a treat. Guitar date will just rock your socks. The 5,6,7,8's are more then a one hit wonder. You will find their tunes running through your head all day long. James Bond girl is like sound track meets ultra lounge. Buy this CD and enjoy"
2,Valid points in the form of concieted verbiage,"Bruner raises some interesting points and rather validly questions some of the developments in psychology and the search for meaning. However, his points, which are delightfully simple, are somehow lost in a sea of convoluted sentences and meaningless words. His examples makes this book only accessable to the trained gurus. It could have been a great commentary, but I ended up so frustrated sometimes that I would lose track of what Bruner was arguing."
3,Gypo,"They are constantly screaming in the movie. It might be realistic, but not a Sunday afternoon relax."
5,THE Greatest Writer in this century,"There is nothing difficult in reading Ms Morrison. She is very detailed and that requires concentration. She answers no questions for you and perhaps that is what makes some readers say she is too complicated. If you remember the character, when she jumps forward or backward in the story, it is easy to pick up where she left off. Beloved is merely a song about a woman's commitment to not suffering any more indignities if it were in her power not to do so. Perhaps her initial method was extreme but then again, what is not extreme about enslavement? What is not extreme about a group of people having no history beyond the 19th century? What is difficult about her novels is that you have to have the answers to these questions before you start reading."
1,"This ""beast"" is not raging","As a fan of many black metal bands (Marduk, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone), I thought I would check this one out. Being open minded I turned the sound up and was waiting for some great black metal. But I just kept waiting... nothing interesting at all came.The vocals were not punishing, the drums didn't sound right, and the riffs were boring as hell; It was so repetitive that I switched to a Horna album instead. The album was rushed and I think that they should step it up if they want to compete with great bands like Urgehal among others.This was a very poorly constructed album and very tired, skip this one and move on."
2,Awful,After reading the rave reviews on Lucky Strike I couldn't wait to start reading it. I was very dissappointed. I did not like the writing style. The story was boring. The characters were unlikable.
1,Huge THUMBS DOWN on both quality and value,"The bin itself is not the issue. You should be able to store 3 layers of ornaments but the paper dividers they provide are so thin that the ornaments stored at the edges fall to the layer beneath. In addition, you cannot get to the bottom layers without taking out all of the top layers because the paper dividers are so cheap and flimsy that the ornaments are sliding all over the place. I wish the dividers were like more sturdy box type compartments. I am going to go to Michael's and buy some of that foam board and cut my own dividers but you shouldn't have to do that when you are paying almost $20 per box for a plastic bin. That makes this a huge THUMBS DOWN on both quality and value."
1,junk,this product came with broken lids and amazon is playing games trying to get them returned....bad business..won't use again.
1,"bio maxell, nicole","it would have been nice if I had been able to read this. But somehow I can;t and the more I work the more trash I get click here, continue here and nothing comes up except the cover. I am not happy to pay 2.30 to look at the cover and I can;t get thru to anyone to solve this . so much for amaazon madeline hartmann"
3,Just before the silence descended,"The latest in a series of Christmas John Fahey albums, and perhaps the prettiest, with flute, piano and cello arrangements gracing some less obvious Xmas pieces - this is Fahey at his most New Age. Enjoying its lambent simplicity, the listener would never realise that this is an album made by a man on a kind of precipice. Fahey was being gradually overwhelmed by various health and financial problems, and after this album nothing was heard from him for five years. (The silence was finally broken by the dark gratings and howlings of ""City of Refuge"" which includes a ghastly 15 minute noise sequence called ""On the Death and Disembowelment of the New Age"".) But as Fahey's Xmas albums go, this is probably the best. The somewhat mechanical syncopation of previous Christmas outings is abandoned for a kind of crystalline purity of melody which represents, in its way, one of Fahey's most extreme statements (as ""City of Refuge"" represents another)."
5,Thrilling,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll definetly lose sleep over this one Because you won't put it down!!!
2,A decent plot was overwhelmed by poor writing,"This is the first book I have read by Tim Green. It will likely be the last. The dialogue was flat and the character development was haphazard. The underlying story is certainly compelling, but this book ended up more of a caricature of a thriller novel than an actual thriller. Furthermore, the author really has failed to do any research about some of the topics on which he writes. Calling a box with wires coming out of it that finds hidden files on your hard drive a ""Norton Utility"" is downright laughable. Honestly, I only finished this book to see how bad it could get, and remarkably, the last half of the book is much better than the first half...but still not worth spending the time to read."
3,Okay...not great!,"I was not really sure how to rate this book. I have read another book by Mr. Green that I loved. His novel Exact Revenge was his Count of Monte Cristo story, which is a favorite of mine, so I went into it with already knowing I was going to like it. But his books get such mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I would read any others. So, with that said, I read great reviews for the sequel to Letter of the Law, so I decided to try it, knowing I had to read this one first. It was okay....not great. I didn't hate the characters like so many other reviewers did, at least the main character was honest with herself about her flaws. And I loved the character of the vicim's father. Don't know if we will see him again or not. But anyway, the story was good, even if it seemed not very plausible,and it kept me reading so I could see what happened. Not great, just okay."
2,weak and predictable,I had hopes for a great quick read. It started out okay but towards the middle got weaker and the end was just so predictable & unbelievable it wasn't funny!!!! The characters are see though and the plot is even worse! Don't waste your time.
2,Almost a thriller,"This was the first Tim Green book I have read. I was interested in something light but exciting and 'Letter of the Law' fit the bill. Neither weak character development, stilted writing, nor somewhat unbelievable plotting took away from my enjoyment of this light read. It didn't matter to me that the author knew nothing about law enforcement or law, it was an ok book to pass some time with. But 2/3rds of the way through the book the author's plot began to be so unbelievable, his characters so absurd that I began to laugh out loud and I skimmed through the remainder hoping that the plot wasn't going in the direction I feared it was heading towards. It did.Additionally, If Mr. Green read's these comments, he should have someone explain to him how computers work. His lack of basic computer knowledge is embarrassing.Still, this book was a fast and enjoyable read and shows that the author has a lot of potential for airport thrillers. I intend to buy his next book."
3,"Wow, this was bad","This was my first Tim Green book, and although it's a quick read, I did not like the story. This makes the second not-so-good book in three days for me.Aside from the computer stuff, did anyone else notice the ""Law for Dummies"" vibe of the book? Some of the lines read like a ""we lawyers do THIS for THIS reason.""Just bad. I agree with previous reviewers about how characters change for absolutely no reason. Shouldn't Sales have been charged for kidnapping? Or did Casey have to press charges in order for that to happen? Either way, there were too many gaps in this book. I thought it was interesting to reveal the killer in the middle of the book, but I lost interest after a view unbelievable conversations."
4,A real page-turning thriller,"Once you start reading it... you will go everywhere with it. Exciting, well written, suspense, intelligent...Go for it."
5,Great,"Product arrived on time and as expected. No broken pieces, and was a great gift to a 7 yr old kid, who loved ti as well.Thank you very much."
3,Not the Best,"I bought this when it was new and rated one of the best new games of the year. We played it a few times when we first got it. It was OK, but nothing like the rave reviews it got. It's been collecting dust since."
3,Ringz,"This is a quick, stratigic game that parents and kids like. It doesn't take a long time to play but it does take some thinking. One of my pieces was broken but we glued it together and it was fine."
3,"Good looks, bad works","Looks great, works badly. The pepper grinder barely does the job. You have to keep adjusting the knob so that it works."
4,Buen regalo para mamá,"Realmente no creo que este producto tenga un excelente precio, pero en definitiva son muy buenos y mi madre quedo encantada con el regalo. Si tienen el dinero para hacer el gasto se los recomiendo más si tienes afinidad a la cocina."
1,Don't bother. You won't get what you're looking for.,"This is a rather boring tape. The author gives several case examples of people who have been helped by self-hypnosis. It's nice to know that others can use the technique, but I wanted some detailed instructions on how to use it for myself, and that was lacking. In fairness, there is a very brief section on ""how to"" actually do self-hypnosis, but it is too skimpy. There are better sources of information out there. This tape is not worth the money. I wish I could return it for a refund."
2,correction to earlier review,"My dogs still love this toy but, like many have stated, the squeaker broke and my yellow lab has managed to bite numerous holes though each end making it likely that I will be throwing it away soon to prevent him from choking."
4,Mutt's favorite toy,"Although it's not indestructible, this toy will last a long time. It may be in pieces, but my dog still plays with it. He enjoys the disassembly. First the squeaker dies, then the fuzz is removed, then the chunks of rubber are found here and there. Finally one ball is lost and now it looks more like a thick handled lollipop. Usually at that time I throw it away and buy him another. Depending on how many other toys your pet has, this may last 2 weeks. Let's face it, almost nothing is going to last with a dog gnawing at it non-stop. This toy, a few tennis balls, and bully sticks is all my dog is interested in. Wish they were cheaper by the dozen or by the gross. :)"
1,very dissapointed,"read all the reviews on this product, bought two for my goldens who love tennis balls and love to chew, litterally within 3 minutes they both had torn the covering and was eating it. waste of money,dangerous for dogs!"
4,"Good, but big",It's a little bit big for my Spitz. I have to wait for him to grow and see if it will work. But the quality is excellent!
2,Didn't last a week,Our dog loved this toy. Sadly it only lasted 6 days before the cover tore off one of the balls and the next day that part of the ball cracked and was easy to destroy. Disappointed pup and owner!
3,easily destroyed.,"Since it is a kong thought it might last ... dog had it destroyed in a pile of rubble in no time. The Dog did like it. Had it been solid, might have lasted longer."
5,good for my golden,My golden likes to play tug-of-war instead of giving you the tennis ball to throw. This toy protects our hands a lot!
3,"Good toy, no squeak","I have a pug, so I figured that this would be the perfect size for him to naw on. He really enjoys it, but it hasn't squeaked since the first day. I thought since my dog has such a small mouth that he couldn't break it, but maybe he did? Either way, it's a pretty good toy."
2,Didn't last long,My catahoula loved this toy the most but destroyed it in a day. She played with it non-stop until it was in several pieces.
1,DEFECTIVE,"I purchased two of these. One did not squeak upon arrival. I sent both back. I did not reorder. I also had the Kong Air Dog football coming from another supplier on Amazon. It arrived today and I squeezed it twice and threw it for the dogs in the front yard. We have two dachshunds. The third time I went to 'squeak' and throw it-it did not squeak. Very, very disappointed. I was under the impression that KONG toys were durable."
1,squeeker poor quality broke in 20 minutes,"We threw this toy for my rottweiller, he only fetched and brought it back with squeeking it by biting when bringing back, the squeeker quit sqeeking within 20 minutes, the soft yellow fabric is starting to peel off. I would not buy another one of these"
1,Not for dachshunds!,I got this for my dachshunds they tore all the fuzzy yellow off on the first day! Its a no go for dauchshunds!
1,Dog was eating yellow fuzzy stuff in minutes,"I will never buy another Kong toy like this or the squeaker balls again. Within minutes I was digging big chunks of the yellow fuzzy stuff out of the dog's mouth. Same thing happened with the squeaky balls and with the ones attached to ropes, they chewed the ropes off both within 10 minutes. Complete waste of money for several toys. And I can't imagine that stuff is good for your dogs if you don't catch them in time."
2,A fun toy for dog but did not last.,"My 5 month old lab/border collie puppy loves squeaky toys. When she received it for Christmas she loved it so much that she destroyed it within hours of having it. The felt on the surface was totally peeled of and the squeaker was ruined very fast. The dumbell also broke off in little pieces and we had to take it away from her, fearing that she would swallow them. Your dog will love this toy, but it won't last very long."
1,Dangerous Dog Toy,"My little poo-mix dog is not a heavy chewer (hardly even got the toy to squeak), but after only a few hours she was able to chew off a side and I found the squeaker on the floor. I'm just thankful that she didn't try to eat it or choke on it. We've had other products from this company, and they were just fine. I would not recommend this one, though. We're going to stick to the non-squeak toys from now on."
2,Not as tough as you think....,"I purchased this at a store, not here on Amazon. (Nothing against Amazon) I have several different Kong toys for my mini Bull terrier, who is an extreme chewer. This toy was ripped apart in less then 2 hours. By day 2, it was in a million pieces. Knowing he is an extreme chewer we do give him bones and such to chew. But whenever he gets a new toy it's game on for this little pooch. So if your dog is a serious chewer then don't waste your money. I thought this toy would hold up atleast a few weeks before he could rip it apart. I stick to Kong toys but for the extreme chewer toys. Which Amazon does offer. (The Kong ball is great fyi) Hope this helps :)"
5,"Even when I'm squeaked out, my dog keeps this toy going.","My Cardigan Welsh Corgi absolutely looooooves this entire family of toys. He currently has a working collection of the dumbell, donut, football, and stick (I call it his ""cigar"")shapes that he is somehow still able to get a squeak out of even though i am unable to, no matter how i try.Be warned, however, that dogs who love to squeak-squeak-squeak all the way home repeatedly just MIGHT annoy the neighbors if you live in a tight urban area like mine. My solution is just to give the Air Kongs a curfew of no play after 9pm or before 8am. So far so good.These toys are probably not for heavy chewers or for dogs who love to defuzz regular tennis balls, but for corgis like mine, these have been a delightful find. Plus, this price is a good $5 cheaper than i usually see at the local pet stores."
2,"For the price, should last longer than a day","On the plus side, the dog instantly went crazy for this toy, and has been chasing it since she got it yesterday. She runs for it, then squeaks it a couple times, then brings it back for another toss. That is where the problem begins. The squeaker disappeared - it is just glued into one end, and suddenly it was no longer there. The dog began to chew to find the squeak, and started to remove the cover. The squeak is irresistible, but the toy is made like a tennis ball, and the cover can be easily chewed off. I don't think that the dog is a hard chewer, but this toy certainly did not stand up. Disappointed."
5,Like the Energizer bunny of dogtoys,"Survived 6 months of 2 large dogs fighting over it befor finally giving up the ghost ( thats about oh, 6months longer then any other toy I've gotten ) and by large I mean 60lb and 130lb dogs it sees alot of abuse and kept on squeeking ( untill the 130lb one crushed it so hard it split open )"
2,Dog loved it and distroyed it within hours,"My pup loved it while it lasted, but I wish this was made of harder materiel. The squeaker was a little annoying but funny. This toy lasted about 2 hours and was torn apart, one of the balls was in 1/2. Careful to watch your dog as this could become a choking hazard"
3,It's a nice toy but a bit too big,I should have read the dimensions. It's a nice toy and well built but this toy is a bit too big for my two puppy cavoodles. I think it will end up being given to their Labrador friend. I'd recommend it be bought for larger dogs.
2,Not for big dogs,"My Leonberger destroyed this Kong in about three minutes. The rubber Kongs are nearly indestructible, but these ""tennis ball types"" are not for big dogs."
3,It's okay,Only because our 185 pound dog is not crazy about this toy. It's harder for to squeak and play with.
2,"Fun toy for the dog, but not durable.",My dog destroyed this in minutes. The toys was fun while it lasted. Not meant for a dog that likes to chew.
3,Shredded quickly,"I thought KONG brand toys were less destructable. Our dog had it torn apart in the first hour. She had a great time doing it, but it didn't last long."
3,Two out of three dogs are ok,"I bought three of these, one for each dog. Two of the dogs are chewers. The Older chewer has had his for days and it is still pristine, yet he loves to play with it. The pup, a seven month old golden retriever managed to chew the cover off half of it in the first five minutes. So not as tough as I thought a Kong toy would be. The third dog just carries it around half the day."
1,Do not let your dog play unsupervised with this.,Being a Kong product I had high hopes and didn't pay enough attention to other reviews. My 8 month old puppy had the yellow fuzz off in no time but still enjoyed playing with it. I left her alone for awhile and came back to see it chewed to pieces. She managed to swallow a chunk of the rubber which caused gastric distress and a visit to the vet. A sleepless night with a sick dog and a $250 vet bill to make sure there was no blockage made this an expensive toy. If you buy this do not leave it with your dog unsupervised.
1,horible,This is the worst toy I have purchased. My 40lb Australian Shepard had all the yellow felt peeled off within minutes the squeeker came out shortly after. Waste off money.
1,Waste of money!,I understand that this is a dog toy and it will eventually get chewed up but completely disintegrated in a mere couple of hours? I would have gave it a extra star if even the rubber bone underneath the tennis ball coating would have lasted but my medium sized dog annihilated this toy into pieces in a few hours. Your better of buying a bag of pig ears that would strangely end up lasting longer. This dog toy is a Fail!
1,My dog bit right through it!,"My dog was really excited about this toy, but bit through it within the first 10 minutes of playing with it. Now it doesn't squeak or stay inflated. He's not a big dog either, 20-lb chihuahua mix. Would not recommend this toy."
1,Squeaker Breaks Quickly,"The squeaker stopped working almost right away, and this is from a dog that is not a strong chewer. If your dog likes to squeak, don't bother with this. As a regular chew toy it will probably last a while, but it is less firm than a regular tennis ball and may not hold up to a big chewer."
3,nice and big,the 1st 1 lasted 4 months the next one last 2 weeks the last one lasted a few hours.it's a nice product but once your dog knows where the squeaky is its done. Believe it or not!!
1,Big Disappointment for Little Lovebird,"Each of the three bags in this order (Kaytee Spray Millet for Birds, 12-Count) contained very large quantities of loose millet, collected at the bottom of the plastic bag, clinging to the front, or seeping from the bag. Not surprisingly, large portions of the sprays in each bag were bare/denuded. The impression given is that these millet sprays are old. I have purchased this product (Kaytee Spray Millet for Birds, 12-Count)from different venues in the past. Each time the millet sprays were in good condition, good quality, and Heather (my lovebird) really enjoyed them. The order that arrived today is a very big disappointment to me, particularly in light of the fact that Heather and I just spent several days without power, heat, and light as a result of Hurricane Sandy and I'm trying to build up her strength with good quality food."
2,"Pale, Very Dry, and Many Loose Pieces/Seeds","I only have one budgie (parakeet) and don't use a lot of millet. Therefore, I bought thisKaytee 6-Count baghoping it would be a reasonable alternative to buying the smallest amount of fresh millet I could find, which is 5lbs. However, I was very disappointed with the condition of what I received. The Kaytee bag contained a whole lot of loose seeds. In fact, the sprays were bare in some places due to all the seeds that had come off them. I uploaded a picture to show what I mean. I assume this was partly because the stalks were very dry and broke easily. Another concern I have is that the seeds were pale and looked unhealthy when compared to sprays from the bulk box at my local pet store. The uploaded picture shows them side by side.Realistically, this stuff won't go to waste. My budgie will eat any millet he can get his beak on and I can sprout the loose seeds for him in myEasy Sprout Sprouter. However, I won't purchase this product a second time."
1,don't do it,"The spays were battered and broken, and a third of theof the seeds were at the bottom of the package."
3,The Best of Oliver Sacks,"Vintage Sacks is a compilation of excerpts from his other books. Oliver Sacks is a neurologist who writes about science. His writings are for the lay person yet they give great insight into various aspects of human nature. He has excerpts from Awakenings about how a group of patients come out of catatonia with the administration of an experimental drug only to later go back into catatonia. He talks about tourette's syndrome, the deaf coummunity, an island of color blind people, and his boyhood experiences that led him to become a scientist.The only reason this book gets such a low rating from me is because I feel you'd be better off getting the original books rather than excerpts from them. Nevertheless, he does frequently give insight into how his perspective on the subject has changed since the first publication of the material."
3,Hard to Follow,I am not a cook and am overwhelmed by the diversity of foods and things that I have never heard about and don't know where to get. Maybe my wife will know.
5,Yummy,What a novel concept. Dr. Ornish and all his lofty little buddies pull it off quite expertly. And it's SOOOOOOOOOOOO easy!
4,yum yum,"a little overwhelming in sheer number of recipes, but good stuff and if it is as healthy to eat this way as argued, I'm in!"
3,Everyday cooking,It is a great book except I recently found that about 5 pages in the middle are missing.
2,misrepresentation,The book image was for the most recent version which you misrepresented. You sent me a much older version of the book. Very disappointing.
2,Complicated Cooking,"I am a big fan of Dr. Ornish and his vegetarian approach to treating and preventing heart disease. When I am trying a new recipe I surround it with simple additions so I can concentrate on the new fare, especially if it includes alot of ingredients. Most of the meal plans in this book are complicated, requiring alot of ingredients for each new item on the menu for that meal. I could not successfully use this book as written, except to try one item at a time."
3,Low fat cooking,"Although this cookbook has some good recipes, it is very difficult to use. There is no index for recipes, so to find anything you have to just page through to find what you want"
4,healthy cooking,"My wife, a very good cook of old and unhealthy ""southern"" dishes, received a diagnosis of heart disease in 1998, and we radocally changed our diet (togther). The recipes often are radically different from what we ate previously, yet we changed. The tastes of some of these healthy recipes are different (and much more 'heart healthy') and delicious with 'new' tastes. Being 'different' is not BAD!"
5,Change In Lifestyle,"This book has been an answer to my prayers. This is only one of the books by Dr. Dean Ornish that I intend to purchase. It is a new experience trying the different recipes. Haven't given up meat completely, but working on it. Some of the meals have you not missing meat at all. Iam hooked."
5,Tasty variety of easy recipes,Great variety of recipes. Easy and relatively quick to prepare. Common ingredients. I lost 40 lbs with Dean Ornish! I love it.
2,No pictures,"I prefer cookbooks that have pictures of the finished recipe. I was disappointed this cookbook didn't have any pictures at all. I also live in a very rural area and am not able to find many of the required ingrediants in any of the stores where I typically shop. Basically, this book will sit on my shelf and not be used."
3,Book review.,"I have tried some of recipes in this book. Recipes are good, but can be expensive since they have many types of vegetables. Shoppers know that fresh vegetables can be expensive. The book, however, is not written in a typical cookbook fashion. It is a little hard to locate and follow recipes. Dr. Ornish is obviously not familiar with the art of writing a simple-to-follow cookbook."
4,An intriguing view,"I found this book very interesting because the notion of a homosexual underbelly in Japan is something that had not really occurred to me before. The rather stereotypical view we usually get is that of a hardworking nation, dedicated to family and tradition. The presentation of gay Japanese cruising each other was thought-provoking, to say the least. As educated as I think that I may be, it is always an fascinating surprise when one of those vestigial presuppositions comes to light, and I am forced to alter my thoughts on the world around me. Mishima's well-crafted style and use of language provide a penetrating and valuable look into an intriguing, though somewhat obscured, example of humanity."
2,He tried hard but didn't get there!,"I'll give credit that at least Mishima tried to tackle the subject of homosexuality from a broader perspective. You can understand the world of gay men, where they go, and what's happening in the minds of these men during the early post-war era of Japan. The ending, however, was no surprise. However, I also give credit to Mishima for pushing the issue out there as best as he could. I'm not sure whether or not he understood his sexuality. During that time, I don't think a lot of men could have. But he tried, and I think through that he helped a lot of other gay men to try, too."
5,"BIG SOUND, AWESOME LYRICS, AT MUST HAVE CD","Submersed is an awesome up and coming band, and their freshman album ""In Due Time"" proves that they can play with the big boys. The album has a big ROCK (not alternative)sound and some out of this world lyrics. I bought this album the day it came out and it has been playing non-stop on my computer and my truck - it is an awesome album!"
1,Ewww...,"How the heck people can give this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me. The singers voice makes me want to eat glass, just so I can be distracted from his flighty, annoying style and the band overall is just plain knock-off boring. There are so many bands out there that do this type of music WAY better than these guys."
1,0 STARS....ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!,"IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT LABELS WILL FUND AND PUT OUT TRASH LIKE THIS. I WAS A FAN OF SUBMERSED WHEN THEY WERE A LOCAL BAND HERE IN DALLAS, BUT EVEN SONGS I KNEW FROM THEN HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED ON THIS ALBUM. THE FIRST DEMO CD I HEARD OF THEIRS WAS WAY BETTER. CREED IS DEAD. SUBMERSED NEEDS TO LET THEIR SECOND RATE RIP OFF ATTEMPT DIE TOO."
4,Power Ballad Is Back!,"If you like power ballads this is power ballad heaven. Combining the musical power of Alter Bridge and song format and composition of Creed all they need is long hair. They flow from the hard stuff to the regular ballad with ease. While they fit together as a band one does have to wonder if this is going to a consistant diet or if they are going to expand their talents into other areas? I'm looking for growth with this good, talented band."
4,It's About Time,"An album like this is long time due. I first saw this album advertised on tv and ordered it right away to check it out. I am a pastor who likes heavy metal and this album is heavy without a lot of religious overtones. ""Hollow"" is a very powerful and well written tune. ""To Peace"" also rocks. The rest of the album is very good. The only song I personally thought was cheesy was ""Flicker."" But other than that in today's music market, this cd is a refreshing surprise."
3,The guitar player makes this CD a 3,"I've seen this band live two times, and let me just say the guitarist in the band is another up and coming of the new age guitar player (perri from Silvertide is another one).The CD has a couple songs I do like though. Mainly because of the guitar that is involved (songs like Flicker and You Run). Hollow is the best complete song on this CD. In Peace also offers some promise, but most of these songs are just average. Not great, but average. It's kind of strange though, because the good vocals and excellent guitar make all the songs on the CD worth listening to. I find them all pretty catchy exept for In Due Time."
4,pretty good stuff,"another cd that people may complain about all songs sounding the same, but that's what i like about it. submersed has a great sound to them--great musically and lyrically! i bought their cd not having ever heard of them before. i was relatively impressed. not the best cd ever by no means, but one you can pop into your cd player and play continuously. not all of their songs are great, but the bad ones are actually tolerable. if you're in the mood for a ""new genre"" band then i recommend buying submersed's 'in due time'."
5,Kick-@$$ in CONCERT and on CD,"These guys were some of the finest musicians I've seen play live EVER. They were energetic and engaged the crowd throughtout their performance. The lead singer was incredibly gorgeous, though I was blown away more by the AWESOME power of his voice. These guys are a definate must and cannot be missed."
5,A surprising Great CD,"Listening to Alter Bridge youd think, That was it, Your not going to he as good, But Submersed may be AS good in a different wayHollow is just out of sight, Deny me and Dripping are very goodId recomend this in Fact I already have it,and Ill play it on air.The effects mixing is superior giving a HAunted and different sound which is only complimented by the Fantastic Vocals and Guitar workWell done, very well donr"
1,Gibberish,"Not only is this book close to indecipherable gibberish, the parts that are clear (relatively) are not at all erotic. Yes, there are a couple of spankings, but really, this book has almost nothing to offer. Frankly, I was surprised I could finish it at all.I'd recommendDiary of a Submissive: A Modern True Tale of Sexual Awakeningif you want British BDSM."
5,Journey Round a Darker Sun,"i loved this book. Most of what's out there is marginal, at best. What a delicious surprise. Thank you, Simon Lowrie, for the wonderful, highly erotic read...i was drawn in by the characters (most especially Paul, Claire and Rachael) and by the conflicted but steady progression of Claire's submission. Let us remember that this is a novel, a fantasy, the opportunity to wander further than W/we might in reality. As well as being a thoroughly pleasurable read, i found Journey to be rich enough in plot and character development to delightfully stimulate my own mental wanderings.A marvelous D/s tale. Not it to be missed, particularly by those with an interest in BDSM....a tale of love, pain, service, Dominance, submission, humiliation, bondage (by voice restraint alone) and discipline..."
2,BORING!,"This book is boring and so poorly written. There is some good stuff regarding the relationships of people but if you are looking to get turned on, forget it."
1,Don't waste your time...,"This is kind of like the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone is saying it's good, so it must be, right? Wrong. I've read 30 books in the last year that were all very much better written than this one. I did keep reading until the end just to see how it ended, but not because it held my interest overall. What a bore. Spend your time and money elsewhere."
5,Purchased for & works works great with my Roku HD Player,"I would defintely purchase these again great price & excellent delivery, works great with my Roku HD Player as i mentioned with my other cables, not currently using all the connections, but espect to soon when I hook my late wifes's HDTV. These cables were well packaged, and connectors fit tightly"
5,Works perfectly,"The cable works great for me. The five cords from the connectors are fused together side by side so it is as flat as it can be, but it is very wide."
1,Did not work.,"When the cable arrived, I was impressed with the quality workmanship and solid feel of the cable. Unfortunately the cable did not work, and no matter how I set up my TV and DVD player, it would not display the video at all. Although both my TV and DVD player have the correct outputs and inputs to use this cable, I could never get this cable to work. Not having a ""known good"" HD component cable to test, I cannot say 100% the fault is the cable, but I was disappointed nevertheless."
2,"Fast Delievery, weird purple moving lines.","I bought this cable to connect my HD DVR to my computer and because component is analog I can record, anyways there was a weird purple area that moves up the screen. So I plugged it into my HDTV and I got the same line, I don't get it with HDMI. So I tried a different component cable with my computer and the line was good. I'm not sure what the problem was but maybe I just got a bad cable."
1,Made in China...nuff said,"Had these boots for less than a year. Wear a size 12, ended up in a size 10 1/2 and still big. The left boot seperated from the sole in about 7 months. All show and no performance...shouldn't be allowed to have the HD logo on it."
3,What's New Is Old,"A fascinating history of the NY police that shows that there's nothing really new under the sun. Heroes, scandals, police brutality, riots and murder have been with us since the beginning. But if you think you've heard it all before, there's a couple of stories here that will surprise you."
3,nypd: a city and its people,"very imformative. I learned a great deal on the subject. Although it reads like a text book, I'm glad I made this purchase.Besides, it was a great deal."
2,Not worth the effort or the money,"From the title. one would expect an in-depth review of the New York City PD, its officers and its problems. What one gets is a ranting history of the NYC police from day one. Most of the book zeros in on a few unknown police officers who the authors tell us were the heros of their day.(Their day being 1850-1940) The last few chapters bring us to ""modern day NYC"" and again-with the exceptional addressing of modern police problems (during the mid to late 1960's the NYPD experienced over 100 police officers killed in the line of duty-this book makes quick light of that)we are again rewarded with the tales of 2 more ""unknown NYPD heros"" that the authors force feed us. In essence, this is a poorly written, totally uninteresting book devoid of any clinical insight into the modern day NYPD"
4,HS Musical is THE thing,Just like all the fashion dolls except this one is affiliated with the extraordinarily popular high school musical. She loves it - she is six years old.
4,VGA Wall Mount Plate,"This item was used commercially in the process of installing several hundred Epson ENO (Smart Boards) in local schools. These items were accurately described, delivered as promptly as promised, and all were received in good working order."
4,PC Monitor Connection,I received this piece on time. It fit my needs as advertised. The only suggestion I have is to provide a link for the appropriate wallplate when ordering or to provide an option to order the plate with the piece.
3,"Interesting, but a disappointing lack of detail.","Though this book is a decent introductory guide to comparative vertebrate anatomy, there is a significant lack of detail in certain sections. The text is very condensed, and difficult to read at certain parts. I recommend using a similar book by Walker."
2,Update of an inadequate text,"I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course. At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal usefulness. When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was introduced. If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who recommend other sources."
5,Hitchcock at his best,Probably most suspense thrillers have copied the action and continuity of Saboteur. It's and oldie but a goodie. A good family film eith a very interesting twist of events... and quite patriotic but without the extreme melodrama.
4,Tone poem,"Vaugly menacing titles like ""Not Every Cown Can Be in the Circus."" A small masterpiece, a tone poem to melancholy in the tradition of Scott Walker or Leonard Cohen, but Peter Milton-Walsh inhabits his own universe. Sucks you in regardless of your mood, but best for down time. The band's most consistent album, and their best; ""You've Become My Big Excuse"" ranks with ""Mr. Somewhere"" among the best of the band's songs. This is an outstanding example of what is sometimes called Chamber Pop--and though labels are the death of creativity and imagination, 'Chamber Pop' is a perfect description of what The Apartments are up to. But appreciation of the term is no substitute for the experience of hearing The Apartments."
3,Great while it lasted....,"This pan lasted just a couple of days shy of 20 months. before loosing its non-stick ability. I used it at most 4 times a week, cooking for 2. Never used metal utensils, dishwasher, or ajax on it. It's a shame because the pan itself is great, sturdy, handles well, and conducts heat evenly and fast. Which is why I am giving it 3 stars. Maybe this is just the life of non-stick fry pans that have to take a lot more heat then most pots. To be fair, my AllClad non-sticks only lasted at most five years, at 5 times the price! So, if you think this lifespan is normal, it's is a good pan for the price."
1,Very disappointed,"I love Tom Jones and the movie ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"", is one of the funniest and cute movies ive seen. The song sung by Tom Jones just sets the scene and suits the movie perfectly. Having said this, I was so excited to find the CD of the same, but its a waste of your money. The ONLY song on the entire CD is Tom Jones singing the song and the quality isnt all that great either. The rest of the CD is garbage and just wasted space."
5,"Eighties, but damn sweet.","The eighties were kind of a musical landfill with nothing but ""Pop pop pop, pop music"", but this is totally different. Fans of the Barenaked Ladies should pick this one up to hear the masters at work. In additon to having 2 FULL albums, 4 FULL e.p.'s, this collection has a lot of amazing stuff that you can't find anywhere else. ""Become a Robot"" would be a top 10 hit today, lenghthened a bit. In fact, all their songs could be lengthened just a tad so we don't have to one-minute wonders. I love ""For Science"", but I would have liked it much better if they had gone into it more. I'm not complaining, mind you, perhaps part of the allure of TMBG is that you don't have to take a day off work to listen to a few of their songs. A certain sameness might overcome most bands over 72 tracks, but not They Might Be Giants. They found a way to keep it all fresh, a true testament to their genius."
5,A Giants classic that contains classics,"I have to say this is a very impressive album. When I started buying TMBG albums, a couple years ago, I bought more recent one's. And at one point I had all but They Might Be Giants and Lincon. This was at the time ""Then"" came out.It certainly made me happy. I saved money and got bounus recordings not herd anywhere else.So if your starting to buy the Giants albums, this is a great cd to start with! Plus I believe that T.M.B.G. and Lincon are the best of the albums, (well, tied with Apollo 18).So believe me, this one's worth you're money!Tracks with my stars of excelance are:Disc1: 1*, 2*, 14*, 17*, 19*, 22*, 28*, and 32*Disc2: 1*, 2*, 4*, 8*, 14*, 15*, 20*, 27*, and 28*"
4,Fun! Exciting! Silly silly silly!,"I was listening to one of these CDs today and was once again bowled over by how MUCH I love TMBG. This is the definitive early collection (when are they going to do ""Now: The Later Years""?) and for those of us who used to listen to them on old copied tapes, this is a VAST improvement. Not to mention the extreme silliness of their lyrics and the amazing musical differences between the songs. The Giants always take musical risks--there's nothing I like better than a guitar and an accordian playing in concert."
5,The best TMBG album out there,"How can you possibly beat four albums for one? If you already have the albums, it is sort of a scam to get you to buy them again, but even then it's worth it."
3,thought that it was very moving,i felt very sorry for the priest and the grils the way societyshuned all of themm because they acted in a uncoth method.
4,A more intimate musical portrait of Elvis...,"I am not a fan of Elvis but do recognize his artistic merit. This set makes a good introduction to novices and provides a few sentimental tracks(disc two)that will please collectors and fans alike. Furthermore the advanced SONY engineering techniques are applied, providing pristine sound like their acclaimed Columbia/Legacy series. Tracks are segemented by developments in Elvis's life, such as his work, meeting Priscilla, genersousity, etc. The 24 titles on disc 1 are varied and are not all hits. I think the songs recorded during the seventies come off best, transferring him from the ""king of rock"" to a mainstream Sinatraesque Vegas pop singer. Fans will cherish the demo, alternate takes, and private recordings on the bonus disc 2. Nice annotation and family photos round out the package."
5,King of Rock and Roll,"Have always loved Elvis and his music, to me he was the greatest entertainer to date, I will always listen to his music as it brings back good memories;)"
2,A Big Disappointment,"There is nothing new here. I've been studying Jack the Ripper for over 30 years and was looking forward to reading this ""new"" book. Who cares about Scotland Yard reports. Many of the files are missing and even purposely destroyed by the police superiors to hide the real identity of Jack the Ripper. The BEST books on this mystery are: ""THE RIPPER AND THE ROYALS"" by Melvyn Fairclough, ""JACK THE RIPPER-THE COMPLETE CASEBOOK by Donald Rumbelow, and ""MURDER AND MADNESS-THE SECRET LIFE OF JACK THE RIPPER by David Abrahamson,M.D. These three books provide the reader with hair-raising details as to the true identity of the Ripper, who is said to have been ""one of the highest in the land."" The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion by Evans & Skinner is a total letdown."
3,ell vcaballo blanco,"I was glad to purchase this product, as I have had it about 20 years go when I taped it from TV one afternoon. The One that I recorded, was in colour and had subtitles, but someone borrowed the take and it was never returned to me and do not remember who borrowed it from me. One day I decided to logg onto the internet and find out whether I may be able to get a copy. I was happy to have found the website in order to purchase a copy. However, I was disapointed, as there are no subtitles and the movie is in black and white. Whereas, the one I had was in colour and had subtitles (in English. I would have liked if it stipulated the grade of the movie being purchased.Thank you"
4,The White Horse to the Rescue!,"If you are a Joselito fan, this is for you. If you don't know, he sings. Beautifully. In Spanish. Like a younger Hispanic Bobby Breen. The film is in Spanish, no subtitles. Not to worry. The plot is basic. You'll have no trouble following along. The other singer is a famous Mexican star. The whole movie is fun, family fare. You don't need to understand the language; just kick back and enjoy this light western flavored fare, apparently filmed in Mexico. Good print, good sound. It's Joselito, for goodness sake!"
5,A wonderful tool for any new or veteran teacher!,"This book is a must have for every teacher! Mr. Grimes' book was assigned to me during student teaching. Over the course of my credentialing program, a lot of books are required reading. This is probably the first one that absolutely had my attention from start to finish. Professor Grimes uses humor and vast teaching experience to create a truly reader friendly book. (I finished the book in less then two afternoon sittings and I am rereading it again!) It is filled with real life experiences that every teacher can relate to everyday. In fact many of the experiences that Mr. Grimes writes, I have to laugh at, because these same experiences have already happened to me. The book is also filled with helpful strategies and techniques that can be used in the classroom right now! A+, Mr. Grimes. A+!"
4,Works Fine,"This bath bench works just fine and will hold the weight it says it will. I broke my knee and not being able to put any weight on my right leg makes it difficult to get in and out of the tub. Delivery was amazing, shipped one day and arrived the next. Putting it together consisted of eight screws and four nut/bolt combos. Once I got the legs adjusted for half in the tub and half out, it was still a little wobbly due to my tub, but once I sat down it became stable. The product works fine and will definitely help people get into and out of the tub who otherwise might not be able to."
2,Fascinating Woman,"Vera Atkins is a fascinating character and I enjoyed learning about her life. However, the book is very poorly and laboriously written. I had a hard time getting through the book but the subject matter kept me going."
4,Above average overview of 80s,"Hosted by Al Michaels, this video covers the top 10 sports moments of the 80s, with memorable plays and tributes mixed in. No. 1 is of course, The Miracle on Ice, called by Michaels. Flutie's 1984 Hail Mary, 1982 Stanford-Cal "" the Band is Still on the Field!"" play, Game 6 of the '86 World Series are some of the great moments. Strangely, the NBA is not featured."
3,Humble Beginnings,"I have to disagree slightly with the 4 star review here. I'm a huge fan of Sleep's later releases, ""Holy Mountain"" and ""Jerusalem/Dopesmoker"", but this is a rather humble beginning. First of all, it's not actually stoner/psychedelic metal in the vein of the later material. Granted it has the odd heavy doom riff courtesy of a young Matt Pike, but the sound is often far more aggressive with lots of screamed vocals. This original line-up saw Pike joined by a second guitarist, but the poor production really loses potential heaviness, and actually creates a rather thin and abrasive guitar sound, not the warm deep sound you might expect.So, overall if you're a fan of Sleep's legendary later albums then ""Volume One"" will certainly be an interesting listen - just don't expect the same heavy stoner sound."
3,wide awake,"This release is nothing like ""Holy Mountain"" or ""Dopesmoker""/""Jerusalem"". This isnt slacker/stoner/trippy stuff like that at all. This is in your face tuff guy screamcore with some sludgy but noisy riffing.Its pretty good but its relentless and its gets a little generic with the top end screaming and the same level 10 production (in the red) on every track. Maybe its the extra guitar player on this one adding to the rage.Not that impressive for this bunch. 3 stars for this one because it doesnt even sound like them,They were wide awake. Play it amongst the others and see how odd this one sounds, not essential but a good wake-up kick in the head !"
1,Inedible,"I took one bite and found this cracker to be inedible. As a result, I threw out the whole box. Parents should not feed their kids this brand because they will never want to eat graham crackers if they think that they all taste like this!"
1,Cardboard Grahams,These were so horrible that my husband & I spit them out & threw away the box. We buy lots of all-natural products that are 100% whole grain but these were horrid. Didn't expect them to taste like Honey Maid Graham Crackers but expected them to have some flavor. Yuck!
1,Stale out of the box,"These don't taste like the regular Honey Grahams. I am not sure if I got a defective item, but I couldn't stomache these. It tasted stale and off."
1,disappointing,"We were big fans of Midel graham crackers before we moved to Canada. We couldn't find them here and so we were thrilled to find them on Amazon. The ones we received from Amazon are quite different from what we were used to buying off the shelf in the States. They are small squares, not regular graham cracker sizes, and as has been noted, they're all broken up, even the flimsy trays that hold the crackers are broken up. Finally, down to our last 4 boxes, they've gone rancid from lack of being used and we can throw them out guilt-free. Even though we're huge fans of Midel Graham Crackers we'll never buy these again. Too bad."
1,Gross.,"We bought these to use for some s'mores cookie bars, but not even marshmallow, chocolate, and a lot of sugar could mask the cardboard flavor of these ""honey grahams."" My faith in natural foods was shaken thanks to Mi-Del. Attempts to sweeten the s'mores treats with maple syrup and agave were foiled by the pervasive and putrid taste.The box smells better than the product.I am normally a huge fan of reduced sugar, alternative sweeteners, and whole wheat products, but nope, not this time."
3,Don't order unless you like crumbs,"Five stars for the crackers, 1 star for Amazon's shipping. I've ordered these twice and both times they have arrived severely broken up. They aren't that way from the store, so I assume that it happens in shipping. We love these crackers--they are REAL whole wheat grahams--actually good for you! If you don't like whole wheat, thre is no reason to buy these."
3,Kid-Friendly But Not the Healthiest,"I got this for my 8 year-old when she briefly decided to try out a vegetarian lifestyle (she has since resumed eating poultry in moderation). It's a mixed bag. The recipes are easy-to-follow, use common ingredients, and are very kid-friendly. On the other hand, many of them are not all that healthy- lots of refined carbs, full-fat dairy products, and so on. A full quarter of the book is devoted to snacks and desserts. Many of the breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes are also on the junky side. For example, the ""Orange Cranberry Almond Cereal Bar"" is basically a variation of a Rice Krispie treat. The entrees tend to be things like pizza, mac-n-cheese, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, burgers, etc.If you're going vegetarian (or eating less animal products) for health reasons rather than ethical ones, this isn't the cookbook for you."
1,"Burning, bleeding, and peeling skin!","I was so excited when I bought Epil-stop & Spray. I thought my days of shaving my legs were over. I followed the directions carefully and waited for the results. I waited the 8 minutes and wiped off the Epil-stop & Spray. The hair came off just like the commercials said it would, but they didn't mention that my skin would start bleeding and burning. A few days later my skin started to peel off. Thanks for the chemical burn Epil-stop & Spray!"
2,comme ci comme ca,"The only reason I could keep reading this book was because of its fast pace. Not a patch on Folsoms earlier book ""Day After Tommorrow"" infact a downright dissappiontment compared to his earlier work. The only redeeming factor for this book is that conducive to Folsoms style of writing it is a racy read and doesnt give you time to think. For that and that reason alone I look forward to his next book."
3,A Good Read But Nothing Special,"Day Of Confession is a fast-paced, entertaining book that is worth reading, but shouldn't be placed at the top of your ""To Be Read"" list. Folsom's second effort could have been much better if it was 100 pages or so shorter. Be aware, if you've read Day After Tomorrow, you're likely to be somewhat disappointed by this book."
4,Interesting story - until the end.,"I really enjoyed his first book, which had a fresh plot and made you think. This book was just fun. Folsom just put his tongue in his cheek and started writing - what came out was a guy who did not know he was superman - the 'baddest"" guy ever - a nice girl - and bad ""Catholics"" - what a great combination. The ending was goofy with all the shooting and outsmarting of the top terrorist in the world by a bunch of amateurs. I hope his next book allows me to turn of my brain again, and enjoy reading another 400 - 500 pages of pure fun."
2,A letdown compared to 'Day After Tomorrow',"I consider ""The Day After Tomorrow"" one of the finest thrillers I've ever read - a must read.""Day of Confession"", though, reads as if Folsom took all the basic plot elements of his first book, and just put new conspiracies behind them. I walked away only mildly entertained."
2,"Where is the plot, Mr. Folsom ?","If you like 667 pages ( paperback version ) of endless and senseless violence, this book is for you. If you are already past the sub-teen years and you are looking for a believable plot, recognizable characters, sensible people doing sensible things, you will search in vain through page after page of violence, violence and more violence. The central theme, that the Vatican plans to become the superpower of the twentyfirst century by first converting 1.3 billion Chinese to Catholicism and then enslaving these new converts to enrich a cadre of aging Italians, defies all sense ! And the story goes downhill from there."
3,Good book to be entertained with a nice plot,"The book has a nice plot. No more USA-USSR trying to conquer the word. I read it in a couple of days and is true it could have been better, shorter and probably needed a better polished in some areas. But it was better than described by some readers. Yes, the killer kills everyone, but he follow his own personality, is no-nonsense. In europe we love this religious-political plots involving high ranked officials at the Vatican, it is still so mystical and secretive for us ... of course, once you read it, you'll realize that it could have been better, still ... To give you an idea of my taste, the best to me in this category is ""The Seville Communion"" by Perez-Reverte (GREAT book, but I don't know about the english translation) and is better than ""At All Cost"" and ""Solstice""."
1,Very disappointing 2nd novel from Folsom.,"I came across Folsom's first book by accident and was immediately impressed and engrossed throughout the whole story. As soon as I saw Day of Confession I grabbed it anticipating an equally enjoyable read. What a disappointment! A very weak story, not believable and written in almost an ""afterthought"" style. It's a book that shouldn't have been written and I'll be more careful the next time I see one of Folsom's books hit the street. I hope he shows more respect for his readers next time."
1,Could Not Pick It Up!,"In my opinion, this book was so awful that I could not bear to finish reading - had to put it down halfway. It is not gripping in the least, and I never looked forward to ""curling up"" with this book at night. The first few chapters were okay (eg, background, historical, and geographical stuff), but it's all downhill from there!"
1,Preposterous,"I enjoyed Folsom's debut novel, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, enough to try this follow-up. I found it quite the disappointment.DAY OF CONFESSION is a pretty bad book. It starts very strongly, but the plot eventually spins out of control, with one preposterous event after another. I found my jaw dropping at the outlandish stuff that Folsom came up with to move the story forward.Even worse, most of the characterization in DAY OF CONFESSION is flat and stereotypical, and I cared for nobody in the story. There's a lot of action in this book, but it is repetitive and boring for the most part. Folsom tries to spice things up with a lot of violence and graphic sex, but it isn't enough to save the over-the-top plotline.I think Folsom is a novelist of great potential, but I wish he would invest more time in creating realistic plots and likable characters. I would give this book a pass."
2,VIOLENT!,The other reviewers have said enough regarding the book and its rather lame presentation. What I want to emphasize is the violence. The main killer just kills and kills and kills--something like twenty people. And the reader gets all the gory details. He mentions that the killer gets some sort of pleasure from the killing. I wonder if Folsom gets some sort of pleasure from it! Enough is enough.
2,It was a dark and stormy night...,Robin Cook's poor writing style with David Balducci's fantastical situations and characters. Two stars. One for effort and one for scope.
2,Day of Confession was a let down,I was so excited when Day of Confession was released. I had read The Day After Tomorrow and totally loved it and expected Day of Confession to be just as good. It wasn't! The story seemed predictable and just plain boring.
2,The Book After the Day After Tomorrow,"I buy very few authors in hard cover anymore because I find most of them are not worth it. But Folsom's first book was so good that when I saw he had another book out I just bought it without thinking. It was a disappointment. The plot was preposterous, as was that of his first novel, but here he failed to make me even want to try to believe it. None of the characters were very likeable or very well-developed. I guess the whole plot and it's delivery could have been done better. He let us know all the secrets too soon and then I just didn't care anymore."
2,"Act of Contrition should follow ""Day of Confession""","I thought ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was excellent - everything a thriller should be (I eventually bought five copies - one hardcover to keep in my ""favourites"" library, three as gifts and my original dog-earred paperback). I was looking forward with eager anticipation to Allan Folsom's second novel and, when ""Day of Confession"" appeared, I snapped up the pricey hardcover instantly. I am sorry to say that it was a complete let down. There are too many reasons why to list them all. Nevertheless, ""Tomorrow"" made me a fan and I hope that, with the pressure of producing a follow-up to a hugely successful first novel behind him, Allan Folsom will put all of the creative energy that was evident in his first book into his third. A knock-out new book soon is the only appropriate Act of Contrition for ""Days of Confession""."
2,Good writing spoiled by an implausible premise.,"I finished this book because of the strong characters and plotting, but the goal of the bad guys (inside the Vatican, no less) is so silly that is makes this effort tiresome. Toward the end it reads like a script for what is ludicrously called a ""high concept"" Hollywood movie."
2,Tired of beating up Republicans? Let's switch to Catholics,"This is a sad, sad follow up to Folsom's first terrific book. In this book, Catholics are open season: We've got several Cardinals at the right hand of the Pope who are poisoning water in China to help their own investment portfolio; an ex-marine priest who breaks his vow of secrecy; a nun who decides she likes sex better than her vow of poverty, and on and on. Even if you can get past all the above, the plot is weak and the story telling (with about a ga-billion 2-page chapters) is lame. Save your money"
4,Great Suspense Story!,"Read ""Day After Tomorrow"" and couldn't wait to finish it. The ending was a real shocker. Was waiting for the same type of ending in ""Day of Confession,"" but, alas, that didn't materialize. However, the plot is very good, the action doesn't stop and the Italian scenery is great! I enjoyed it immensely!"
3,a good choice for a summer read,"This book starts with a bang and never seems to live up to that potential. There are many other reviews you can read to get the plot of this story so I will just sum up how I feel.The love story was quite contrived. The relationship with the brothers was also forced. The most interesting relationships were those of the men in the Vatican.As for the story itself. It is a new twist. The thought of world domination in this day and age not by a country, per se, but a religion. In a way it is a reverse holocaust.If you are headed to the beach and want something to occupy the time and not drain your brain this book could fill the bill."
3,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this fast-paced, easy-to-read, action-filled thriller. It's not great, but it's good and quite entertaining and the action is non-stop. I honestly can't understand why so many reviewers here have been so negative and picayune. Folks, thrillers don't have to be realistic; they're supposed to be entertaining and diverting, and on those groounds this book satisfies."
3,any organization with diplomatic immunity is fair game,"Ok so this was no ""Day after Tomorrow"" but still I am a Folsom fan and I forgive him for this longwinded tale..No one really knows what goes on behind the walls of the Vatican and hey .It could happen..these people are after all human...Absolute power corrupts absolutely.."
1,Boring,Typical hype and then let down. Like the first Folsom book dragged along. Look at Spear of Golgotha for a thrill.
2,"Bad, Bad and getting worse","Those of you who read ""The Day After Tommorow"", a brilliant thriller, were probably waiting an amazing punch-line in Folsom`s latest release as well.......Well, don`t hold your breath, it`s disappointing, dull and pointless....same as most as the book.Sorry, Mr. F., loved your first, hope you`ll do your magic again on your next novel."
3,Rides on the heels of Day Afetr Tomorrow,"I LOVED ""Day After Tomorrow"".This book (Day of Confession) is a let down,although a fun,quick read.I didn't have nearly the depth of the previous book.It felt as though the writer,Mr. Folsom,used many of the same mechanisms used in the first book.While these are efective,too many correlations to situations and character could be tied to the previous book.Overall,it was descent,but not great.I liked the previous book,much more."
1,let the buyer beware,"His other book, The Day After Tomorrow,was really enjoyable, and I was looking forward to reading this one. Unfortunately, it just didn't meet any of my expectations. The only good things I can say about it was that it was an easy read, I didn't have to think while I was reading it, and I didn't waste a lot of time on it. The characters were ridiculous, and I didn't care whether or not a character died. The plot was silly, and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the so-called ""twists"" and ""developments."" This book is not up to the genre standard."
1,I confess -- I hated it.,"Implausible plot. Unbelievable characters doing astonishing things. A bad guy who would make Judas Iscariot look like a choirboy and Superman look like a 72 lb weakling. An ending that is predictable and boring and thoroughly unlikely.Even Harlequin Romance novels provide better reading. Even ""The Dukes of Hazard"" provide better plot lines. Even ""The A-Team"" provide better entertainment.This is a novel that should have been a comic-book.Read this book. Get absorbed by the plot. Believe that The Pope is guarded by the Keystone Cops. Believe in a bad guy who is *so bad* he'll rot your teeth. Believe that a millionaire American lawyer, a unchaste nun and an ex-military Priest can save the world......or believe in Space Aliens instead. They're much more plausible and more entertaining.What a waste of money. What a joke."
3,Bad editing,I really enjoyed the book but was very disappointed by the huge number of typos...like they used OCR software and didn't do an edit. I paid too much for that.
2,Yawn,"After the good reviews that I read I was looking for a whole lot more. I struggled, more often than not, to get to the non-conclusion of this rather contrived piece. The sex espisodes seemed purely gratuitous, poorly drawn, and made little or no contribution to a story line that was haphazard at best."
2,wait a minute...,"It started of good and went downhill, even after I finished it. Folsom's first book (DAT) was very entertaining and pretty muched wrapped all the plotlines together in the end. Tis is a similar story. Lone wolf american (with his team of justice do-ers) jumps about europe seeking the answers to a diabolical plan set in motion by a sect of power hungry evil folk. It is fun to read, a metric ton of adventure and action keeps you reading. But when it is finished you realize something is missing. Then you realize NOTHING WAS RESOLVED. Only two plotlines of this over layered novel comes to an end. Actually after finishing it you come to think that the bad guys won. Mr. Folsom kind of forgot to solve the complex plot that he created. for shame allen. for shame.if you liked DAT read this but don't expect much. except a dissapointment at the end."
3,"A good, not great ""religious thriller""","I enjoyed ""Day of Confession"" as a light read with an interesting premise. It won't go down in history as a great novel!The premise of corruption in the Church involving international bioterrorism and an international hitman is timely considering the world today -- but some of the plot turns left me shaking my head in disbelief. Although most of the main characters of the novel were clergy or religious, the book is not particularly religious and gives virtually no insight into how a member of the clergy would spiritually respond to the terrorist scenarios envisioned in the book. I also found the sex scenes to be a bit gratuitous.All in all -- the book was an enjoyable diversion for a few evenings -- but probably not something I'd read again."
1,Terrible mess,"This is easily the worst book I've read in a long time. Let's see, we have the Catholic Church, corrupt Italian police, dubious Swiss bankers, Chinese communists, the CIA and a midget that lives in the Rome subway tunnels. The only thing missing is the Russian mob, Columbian drug kartells and Islamic fundamentalist to complete this tumultous potpurri of plots. Another review called it 'Die Hard in the Vatican', but I'd bet that even the producers of 'Battlefield Earth' wouldn't touch this script with a ten-foot pole."
4,Complex thriller,"Harry is the detached brother of Daniel whom is in a world of trouble. Harry tries to have him, but is a minute too late. His brother is missing, then is pronounced dead. But is he really? Harry gets himself dragged through a nightmare of political deceptions and a struggle for power.It is a good upbeat book by Allan Folsom. The middle dragged a little, but was picked up quickly by some more drama. If you like terrorist books, then you must read this."
4,"Priests, midgets, global corruption - all here!","I can't believe this book isn't ""hot"", or if it is, I certainly didn't know about it. I didn't even realize it was written by one of the authors of Day After Tomorrow.It has all the classic elements, with fresh textures, of a solid action thriller. Kind of a Bourne Identity meets Man in the Iron Mask, it unappologetically makes the upper management at the Vatican the bad guys who are chasing around the unsuspecting estranged brother of a murdered priest.The cat-and-mouse of the bad guys closing in on the good guys is what motivates the story, but there are enough peripheral characters that are well-developed enough to flesh out the protagonist's universe."
3,I Confess: This Book Should Have Been Better,"True, this book is not as engrossing as The Day After Tomorrow. The plot is more predictable and to a certain extent repetitive. That said, Day of Confession is still an enjoyable read. If it were not for the expectations following The Day After Tomorrow (""TDAT""), I'm sure the reader ratings for this book would be higher.Once again, as in TDAT, the reader should be ready to be shot out of the box from page one. Folsom paints on a broad canvas stretching three continents and multiple characters. He is obviously quite talented in both imagination and organization. Many seemingly irrelevant points become relevant on later pages. Many seemingly unrelated storylines are proven later to be one in the same. Despite the book's flaws, I found myself eager to pick up the book and continue reading.I would simply warn the reader not to expect the day after The Day After Tomorrow."
3,Not as exciting as Folsom's first thriller,"Folsom's first book, Day After Tomorrow, was so exceptional and had such a dramatic ending, that anything else was bound to be hard to follow. In Day of Confession, there is major action on Page 1, and the whole rest of the book seems to be one long conclusion. Too long, too many delays, most characters are predictable. I still like the genre, however, and will look for Folsom's next book."
2,Only mildly interesting,"A major disappointment after the tremendous DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Dull characters, a dull plot, lack of characterization of the primary protagonist....very little to keep ones attention. If you're wavering at all, take a pass on this one."
3,Worthy book,"Folsom's book is interesting with great suspence and with enough original ideas.However I have the feeling that the main characters are not well described,even the terrorist Thomas is examined so deeply and with a unique way by Folsom.I did not like somehow that many ""scenes"" happened with an easy way,from some common people but the action in general in whole book,is quick and fascinating. I have to admit that the story is clever but cannot consider this book complete,you will understand why reading it.But it is worth to read it anytime."
3,Can anyone help?,"Parts of this book seem very familiar to me, but others do not. Does anyone out there remember a similar book about a Vatican plot that begins with a priest being killed by being shoved off a balcony in St. Peters? I think I have the two books tangled up but cannot remember the name of the other one."
3,"Fun, exciting, though a bit too long","I read and enjoyed Folsom's ""Day After Tomorrow"" but this book suffers the same problem, going on about 100 pages too long. Still, it's a good summer read full of action, narrow escapes, and a pretty clever plot about a conspiracy that leads to the heart of the Vatican.However, there is a last page revelation that sort of negates what has come before. Worth a look, but not essential."
3,"Mr. Folsom's first book, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was better","Like the reader from Singapore, I was also disappointed in this book. Mr. Folsom's ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was an intense page-burner. If you have not yet read ""The Day After Tomorrow"", then do not wait any longer! Yes, it is THAT good. However, it will spoil you: you will search for other books that measure up, and you won't have much success.Perhaps I expected too much from ""Day of Confession"". If it were written by anyone other than Mr. Folsom, it probably would have rated fours stars. It is a good read, but pales in comparison to his previous work.Has anyone out there read ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and then found any thrillers that are as intense/good?"
3,"Not ""Day After Tomorrow""","I really enjoyed Folsom's previous novel ""Day After Tomorrow."" I'm not sure if he will ever top that one, but he didn't do it with this one. To be fair, his writing style is entertaining and his characters are refreshingly off-kilter. His writing and plotting and descriptions require slow reading, a thoughtful progression through the story. And that may be why this one didn't hit as hard as ""Tomorrow"": the time and mental energy was not as rewarding here. Still, I'll buy his next one, and hope he will at least match ""Tomorrow."""
2,someone outlaw 'Vatican Thrillers' !,"had to read this for a book group ( along with Arthur and George - what a contrast !) Knew in the first 10 pages I would hate it. Angels and Demons was quite good and I admire Dan Brown and the whole Da Vinci code phenomena but enoughs enough ! In Folsoms defense this was published 2 years before 'angels' and 4 years before 'da vinci',but its just the same stuff over and over. I was raised a catholic and its all very interesting and intriguing at first but becomes EXTREMELY boring very quickly. I'm also too cyncial for these books - I can never be convinced of the conspiracy theories and spend the whole time saying 'as if'.Never again."
4,Enrichment,This book will give you a new appreciation for the Bible. There are very interesting facts and observations that I would have never thought of in a million years. I pick it up every day to learn something new. The only problem I had was in one section it says that supernatural manifestations went out with the early church and that they are not for us now. There is nothing in the Bible that says that and furthermore we are seeing miracles in the 21st century so that theory doesn't work.
5,Excellent Performance,"There is much to commend about this performance. However, his interpretation of the chorale theme at the end of the 1st and 5th movements is revelatory. While many fine performances of this symphony exist, no on touches Sinopoli's handling of these moments!"
3,Who is this supposed to be?,"At 10' away, this looks like Willow. At 5' she looks like her ugly cousin. I'm a hardcore Buffy fan and I couldn't stand to look at her so I sent her back."
3,So so,"I bought this game and it was very hard to control the horse and get over the jumps. But, otherwise this is a very good game. If you buy it I hope you have good success - better success than I've had."
5,Worth the money,"I was reading the reviews for this game and I was very shocked by some of the reviews it got! I have every horse game (computer,PS2,X-Box,exc.)and I never played a better computer horse game ever! If your child likes horses then this is a very good game for you to purchase. Do not listen to some of these reviews because they are true and fair to this game!I sure hope this review helps!"
2,Could be better,"I bought this game a couple years ago, and I recently had to throw it out! It won't run on my Dell 98 desktop or my Dell Inspiron 5160 laptop anymore. :( I was never able to play the Champion Season on the desktop, but on the laptop the graphics where HORRIBLE!The game was really fun, and it I would rate it a 5 if not for the malfunctions! I love being able to pick horses!A tip, if you win 1st place you get a couple more horses to choose from, then if you just won 2nd or 3rd!The graphics where ok, and the riding was tons of fun!"
3,Decent game,"Okay, I'm a rider for starters. The game is most definately not made by people who know about horses. It is very unrealistic - you can dump food in the fodder box from across the stall, you can sweep stuff out of the aisle while amazingly far away from it, you can fill the food bucket without being near the food box, and it's generally just - as I said - not realistic. Despite this, the graphics are okay, and despite what other people have said, the character and horses are extremely easy to control. I also have never experienced trouble loading. Maybe their computers just don't work as well or something, but I know that on my typical Windows 98 computer, it loads like a charm and the characters move even better. The plot is somewhat lackluster, but it's a fun game, which would be great if it was just more realistic."
4,horsecrazy,"i really liked this game. i think legacy of rosemond is the best. when you start your aunt has died, and you get her horse, alhpa. you train alpha and then you have to different stuff in the barn for him- like gromming and feeding him. after you do well in a compition you can get a new horse. my favorites are cocktail and sunny girl. the bad thing is that you can only have 3 horses at a time and if you want a new one you have to get rid of another. i also don't like that the girl you play moves so slow and i am always getting stuck with her. but besides that this is a good and fun game!"
2,Beware,Beware this game is fun but if you you don't have the right comp it will crash and make your computor slow. But over I gues you can call it.
1,Creepy. That's all I have to say.,"This game ""Lets ride Rosemond Hill collection"" is creepy.The horses scared me compared to other horse games I have.They move REALLY SLOW and it takes forever to finish a riding course on time.The graphics are hideous and this just makes the poor horses look creepy.The controls in this game are terrible and its very hard to maneuver the horses towards a jump correctly.It looked nothing like what it described on the cover.This game also has A LOT of errors in it with the graphics.I got tired with this game on the second day I brought it and if I were you I would not waste your money or buy a better game series like Horse Life."
4,This game is fun...,"THis game is pretty fun, but it does take a long time. If you know how to operate the keys on the keyboard, Alpha (or another horse) will go and if you shave edges off on the jumper course, you'll beat Melissa! This is very hard to do, trust me... Also, what helped me was writing down what i have to do before each comp. (cleaning out comet's stall, taking rocky out) so if i have trouble in another game, I can go back to what I wrote and do it. At the end, with the dance, that's kind of wierd and awkward, and the people look like robots. Rather than dancing, I'd rather be riding.I don't get what the liniment from the cabinet does. It doesn't really do anything!Make sure that you go in the lounge often. Sometimes there will be phone calls with your family or an interview! That's really fun because you choose what to say!Overall, this game is ok...Oh, and if you have nothing to do, you can ride comet, rocky, or talk to melissa or john! That's fun..."
5,If you like horses and freedom buy it!,I love this game because it gives you freedom and horses! This is my favorite game out of all the Let's Ride games. I have a horse and love him dearly and this game is exactly like owning a real horse! There's a whole story behind the game which makes it more fun. If you love horses this is the game for you!
2,Let's Ride: The Rosemond Hill Collection (2 games),"This game is very fun but has a lot of problems in it. Both games are terribly hard to play and I'll tell you why. Legacy: Alpha is really hard to train and ride. He rears about every 10 steps in practice! In practice, the horse moves slower than normal. In the first competition, you get to choose from four horses: I like Do It the best. It 's always hard to get the wheel barrow back into the barn after mucking the stall and dumping it. Sometimes you get stuck in the walls and then you can't get out. I warn you, do not ride John's horse; you can't get off! When you sweep the dirt out of the barn, it appears again in about 5 seconds. Melissa is mean, but Comet is smooth and nice to ride. Competitions: The horses will NEVER jump! Then you have to back up and TRY to jump again. Somtimes you will be successful, sometimes you're not. I really hope this review helps you."
4,Just A Little Warning,"This game was great overall. DO NOT play Competitions At Rosemond Hill. It is impossible! It's extremely difficult to manage around the course and find which direction to go.Legacy of Rosemond Hill is OK. The graphics aren't the best and the controls are sometimes hard to manage. But otherwise, it's pretty much okay."
1,Let's Ride the Rosemond Hill Collection,"First we have been unable to access the Legacy of Rosemond Hill part of the game, the answer from Value Soft being useless. The Competitions part of the software features lousy graphics, soft focus, and so far we haven't run through a game as you can't read anything to set up your track. We have loaded it on an older laptop and now our newer desktop and this is the first software that hasn't worked on either computer.The limited instructions given are useless at this point. I had purchased the other Let's Ride game for my daughter and it will be returned unopened. I really appreciate paying $25 for software that is this shoddy giving me the joys of a pouty kid who doesn't understand why the game isn't working well."
3,Not as bad as being noted,"I felt I had to write to clarify errors in other reviews. A hand is 4 inches. This measurement is to the withers of the animal so 15.7 is an accurate size for a horse. The withers is the ""hump"" you see between the horse's back and neck. Don't judge the game by honest mistakes made by the inexperienced in their reviews. Just buy this game based on age and experience appropriateness."
1,I HATE THIS GAME.,"I HATE THIS GAME. IT IS VERY HIGHLY ANNOYING. IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO PICK UP A SADDLE OR A BRUSH TO BRUSH THE HORSE'S HAIR, but on the way to the stable, guess what? I get stuck in a wall! My computer exeeds the requirements and I am just staring at the screen, pounding on my mouse trying to get my player out of the wall! The ""3-D"" images are just crappy. It's like a play made out of cardboard props that are transparent that you can walk through. I don't know if I have a faulty game or what. Then I try to ride the horse and we all get stuck in a bush or tree. The horse then loses all of it's health and I am like, yelling at the computer. I am not really a horse rider myself, but this is probably not for beginners."
4,pretty good game,"this game is sooo good,i just have trouble with it.its hard to get Annie into the stable after dumping the wheelbarrow.also,its hard to jump close enough to really get over it.HINT:when you can get her,get Do It.She's fast,and can run at full speed for about a minute.I say this is a good game!"
4,fun...but a little confusing,"This game is fun and all, but it could use improvments..... Graphics for one thing but the most confusing thing is when you have to muck out the stalls everything is fine until u have to go outside and dump it then u can't get back in!"
2,Bad to worse,This game had really bad graphics and some things you could not understand and it was to easy it had no challenges at all I would never let anybody play this game at my house!
2,its okay,"only one out of the 3 games is worth while. the legacy of rosemond hill is lots o fun, but i always get stuck in a wall or something like that. competitions at rosemond hill is just plain dumb. dont play it. too many gliches. and whats with the mystery game? the game pack is called ""lets ride"" and there are no horses in the mystery one. its dumb. and also its not too hard to have dressage because the ""lets ride champion collection"" has dressage. i can't really complain though b/c jumping beats dressage any day. overall the games are okay but there are way too many gliches. happy riding."
3,It's an all right game,"There are a number of things to do in this game. There are plenty of tasks to compleate and you can go riding any time you like. You start off with one old horse called Alpha. When you walk up to him there will be a number of items on the bottom of the screen. If your horse needs somthing a picture of what he needs will be blinking. It's fairly easy to figure out the rest. You will probably be able to beat the game in 2-3 days. The graphics are ok, but somtimes you or your horse will get stuck in a wall or somthing. Your character moves extremely slowly so it will take you a while to get anywhere. Somthing I find extremely annyoing is that often right when your in the middle of a compition and are doing well the game will freeze up! Overall the game is fairly fun to play."
1,NOT SO GREAT,This game got so boring because I can't get into Western Championship.I've practiced all of the things I needed to practiceon and I still can't get to it.John doesn't help.I'm not going toplay this game any more if I can't get any help. The other reviews don't help.I'f you write a letter to the people that made this game thay won't help you.I hate this game but I would like it if I had help on it. The way thay say the horses act thay don't act that way.You can't give them any water.Thay said it is the best riding game when it's not.When Annie canters on the horse she leans forword and your not suppose to because that will only make the horse go faster and I should know that because I take horse lessons. So don't waste your money on this game because it's dumb.
3,it's OK,"I've had this game for a couple of years, and it's very good, but there are some annoying things about it. 1-Sometimes when I clean the stall and take it out, I can't get back in. 2-Sometimes I get stuck in the wall...glitch? Another thing, on the internet, it says something about a diamond mystery...I've never done it!! Never even a hint about it! Competitions at Rosemond Hill is VERY, VERY hard! The map does NOT tell you where you're going, and I end up in a white or black field of ""nothingness"" because I go out of bounds. Other than this, the game is very fun because it's YOUR responsibility for your horse(s) and your life. The foal at the end of the game is cute, too, even though you can't take care of it LOL :)"
4,difficuilt,"i loved this game but its really hardto get to the western champion ships there were a lot of spelling errors and the graphics were ok. the best horse to get is cocky (cocktail) alpha is just plain slow. Cocky is wicked fast and a pretty good jumper, i also thought that the game gets boring when u can't move forward but if you like horses then u will deffinetly love this game(if u have any clue what the third event is to get to the western champions then could you pleas post it up it would deffinetly help.)"
2,"Nice Concept, Serious Issues","The graphics aren't that bad, the video isn't bad either, but like what everyone said before, this game has stuff that makes no sense. Like the developers left out the little details.For example, for the tasks, one person will ask you to clean out""Comet's stall"" but the person never says which of the, what, maybe 10 stall stable is Comet's. Same with being asked to take someone else's horse to pasture.. I later noticed his horse looked the same as the horse I chose on the second level. So many gliches as well. For example, it won't let me let go of the horse, or let me put the horse in its stall, drives me nuts! Its ashamed because the game has so much potential. It just needs to be more user friendly and logical."
4,Good,"Not as good as their previous albums, but definitely worthy work.It's actually surprising to me how good Mark Feehilly is. His voice is one of the best I've ever heard. I wouldn't mind if he went solo. The other lead is a very solid singer, but his voice just doesn't compare to Mark's."
4,A return to form!!!,"After the career mishap of ""Allow Us To Be Frank"",Westlife return to familiar territory.Big ballads,carefully selected cover versions and a duet with one of the biggest names in popular music,Diana Ross.Their first REAL album as a quartet will keep longtime fans happy,even though Bryan's voice is still missed in the mix the four lads from Ireland manage quite well.The stand out track for myself is ""Hit You With The Real Thing""!An absolute stomper.A couple more tracks like this would have been welcome but a good effort none the less.Glad to have the boys back!"
3,sheldon,"I found these guys about 3 years ago I was wondering why I never heard of them before they are my fav group and always will be. They are big well known all over the world, they never preformed in the U.S.. At the time we had the Back Street Boys the rest of the world had Westlife. Don't get me wrong some people liked the Back Street Boys but Westlife is so much better. West Life has some original songs but mostly they do covers, normally I don't like people doing covers but Westlife does the covers better then the original performers."
2,averagley pathetic,"Many of the games in this are really freeware, which is extremely dissapointing to me. The program the games are on is kind of hackish.. and the games arent the best. The only way it would be even mildly worth it is if you had a full-fleged color palm... and even then, you wont totally like the selection of games."
3,Decent,"Overall it was a good change of pace book for me. I have dabbled in open mics so I was curious as to how he painted the stand up comedian picture as a novel. Bill always writes from a smart perspective and I enjoyed this. It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever read, but I definitely don't regret reading it."
5,Bill Maher; A man who knows comedy and can write about it!,"Bill Maher knew what he was talking about when he wrote this outrageously funny book! He captured the comedy scene with a scence of brilliant arrogence like no other comedian could. Read this book then read it again in a year then read it a year after that, its gets better with every read. You will feel like you've lived the comedy uprising, from the small numbers of hard working dedicated comidens to the funny guy in your group of friends who thinks he can get up on stage and make it big because you ""say hes funny"". I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys smart comedy and/or likes the comedy club scene and would like to understand what the ""Host"" for the evening is thinking."
3,Some thoughts,"This book is semi-OK. It was my the first book on neural networks. Programs descriptions helped me significantly to get feeling of the field. The book was useful source of C code to implement homework assignments in AI class, although I was forced to scan the source code and use OCR program (running neural networks as well!) to get the electronic version of the code. Applications are badly commented. Obsolete Borland interface is such a pain to get rid of. Math is inconsistent, so I read other books on ANNs before I started to understand something. Not the best choice for the first reading..."
2,"Misleading title, obsolete code","With an impressive title as that, you'd expect some solid code interspersed with good explanatory notes. Instead this admittedly older book utilizes C++ solely to employ a hopelessly obsolete DOS-based Borland Turbo Vision interface. C (no C++) is used to somewhat clumsily implement all the actual neural networking code. If you are well-versed in C -> C++ porting, and are willing to ignore all the references to Borland & set up your own UI using e.g. Visual Studio, you will be able to extract some useful knowledge from this book. But my advice is to pass it up in favor of other choices."
3,"Meaty, but could be a bit more organized.","Except for the hiccup at the beginning of using Turbo C++ DOS GUI, develops into an average to better than average book. Worth buying, but don't expect too much C++ or object oriented code. Has a good mix between theory and applied code. Could be improved in a second edition."
4,michael@bimamail.com (NO SUPPLEMENT DISK),"I'm a student majoring in Information Tech. I'm studying in ANN, FA, and GA subjects. I've read this book, but I've not the SUPPLEMENT DISK. So, if you have it, please send it to my email above."
2,Diehard Fans Only Need Apply,"The overall sound quality on this album can be rated (by Hotwacks standards) as a fair to good audience recording. In other words, this is a decent bootleg quality album. An energetic performance for sure, but the muddled, bass heavy sound makes ""The Most Primitive Band in the World""a really tough listen. For diehard fans, pick this up on eBay or zShops to round out your collection. For newcomers, I suggest a double buy of ""Eternally Yours"" & ""I'm Stranded"". Arguably two of the best punk rock albums of the late 70's."
4,Like the orange flavor better,"We have been using the Coromega orange flavor packets for a few years so I thought we would try out the lemon-lime. The lemon-lime tastes fine, but causes lemon-lime burps. We have not had this problem with the orange. It also comes in orange-chocolate which sounds gross, but we may have to try it. As far as price, the Coromega website offers this product for $39.95 plus shipping and my local food co-op sells it for $31.95 so Amazon wins hands down for pricing. Overall, an easy way to get your daily dose of Omega 3 oils."
1,preservative,"Do not use this product. It contains a very harmful preservative, sodium benzoate, proven to harm cells and contribute to cancer. t does taste great so tell the company to take that out."
3,YUCK! Until you get used to it.,"My 9 year old son and I like the orange Coromega omega 3 packets (my 7 year old daughter not so much), so we were hopeful the lemon lime would be good. These products have great omega 3, DHA and EPA content, but this lemon lime flavor...yuck! We're pretty disappointed. We will reorder the orange, and probably try the tropical flavor, but in the meantime I'll have to choke these down myself.Update: 9/19/2012 We've been taking these lime omega packets for about 2 weeks now, and I maybe we just got used to it, but the taste isn't as bad as we first thought. Still not as good as the orange, but I'll raise my rating from 2 stars to 3."
2,Coromega=Great! : Lemon Lime flavor=No-Go!,"Listen, Coromega's products are great and provide easy access to a vitamin (or is it a mineral?) that can be hard to come by sometimes. I bought this Lemon Lime flavor because my wife once told me that she hated orange-flavored ANYTHING. I am the opposite and love orange-flavored products. So, I got one box of each so that she could have 90 days of Lemon Lime and I could have 90 days of Orange. Well, she hated the Lemon Lime... and so did I. We compromised and agreed to alternate between ingesting both flavors so that they didn't go to waste, but we will not ever be buying this flavor again. You have been warned! :)"
3,good,"kids said it was like eating 1000 skittles at one time. I didnt see a change, so i won't buy again."
5,No fishy taste!,"I first discovered these in a pharmacy near where I worked. No fishy burps, and the taste isnt that bad! An easy way to get some omega 3's into your diet."
2,Not Really Gardenia,"I'm looking for a true to life gardenia perfume. This is not that.It barely smells like gardenia, and instead has some overwhelming, obnoxious note I've smelled in men's colognes.And the oddly designed spray top breaks after a couple spurts, forcing you to have to take the whole thing apart to try to get it to spray."
4,Great basic arms and hands posture for belly dancing.,"This video gives you a nice hand warm-up and all around exercises to enhance your choreographies. Fahtiem is this sweet soft-voiced dancer with incredibly graceful arms that shares some of those movements and how to incorporate them in your dance. If you are looking for fancy postures, this is not for you, but if you want a good arm and hand workout this is it. The video also includes body warm-up and ways to showcase the use of the movements learned. She sums it up with a small performance that showcases her arms and it does look very nice. Its very pricey for what you get but its better than any other video out there as far as I have researched."
5,Hands are the energy of the dance,Hands are so important when expressing the dance. This dvd helps show case the body and can direct attention to make your dance more captivating. Fateim is clear and gentle in her approach. A must for all dancers.
4,Get your motor runnin',"The Moog Cookbook reinterprets classic rock hits from the '70s. This album brings a smile to my face. They came up with very clever and amusing arrangements of these songs on synthesizers. All of these songs have brief ""quotes"" from other songs within them. For instance, at the end of ""Rock and Roll All Night"" you can hear snippets of ""Turkey in the Straw"", ""Camptown Races"", ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"", ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""Old MacDonald"", ""Swanee River"", ""Battle Hymm of the Republic"", ""America the Beautiful"" and ""God Bless America"". And there are probably a few that I missed!"
1,A total stinker,"This is the most dreadful listening experience to which I ever subjected myself. I love synth music, and I love classic rock, but to hear these songs treated in such ridiculous fashion made me wonder if this was all some sick joke that I wasn't in on. This is just mindless plink-plonk noodling on a great instrument set in ""Mickey Mouse"" mode. Pitiful arrangements and numbingly dull. More fool me for buying."
5,Gladys FtLauderdale FL,"This is a great book, I really learned a lot from it. My son has Eczema and this is something that is an ongoing problem but understanding and knowing how to treat it safely specially for a 3 yr old child. Good information"
1,Aww Poor Billie!,"If this man ever really cared about his father, he wouldn't release such sad sad (as in horrible) music. If he gave half a damn about his father, I doubt that he'd reach into America's pocketbook and sell his father's soul for money and fame. What a sad person this man is, I'd never do that to my father. Buy this single and prepare to die a fat nobody 20 minutes after visiting your local mall."
1,OK,"If you are into ""card playing simulations"" you might find this useful, me, not so much. After reading it I will use maybe one of the activities in my classroom. As for the activities being ""short,"" plan on, for most of these, 2-3 class periods. To me short is one class period and done. I was not impressed."
1,Disappointing,"The quality of this product was particularly low, especially when you consider its cost.I am an educator and would have been better off spending the money on making my own supplies."
5,An Abbey Road Christmas,I think this is fabulous! This old hippie thinks it's the Abbey Road of Christmas albums. Aloha.
3,Good as a selective reference,"The essays are excellent and informative, but there is a noticeable emphasis on musicians from outside the U.S., occasionally to the short-shrifting, in my humble opinion, of some of the better known U.S. musicians. Also, if you're looking for a _comprehensive_ guide to recorded music, this is definitely not it. The authors select a few albums they feel are noteworthy and don't mention the rest."
4,"Not the perfect book, but a great reference","Like all guides that intend or claim to be definitive references to their subject matter, this falls short to an extent, and will not please everyone. However, along with other companion books, this is a great reference guide to jazz artists and styles."
3,"""Rough Guide Rock"" is better","OK, this book is a good manual if you want to know something about special artists and some of their records, but it were just three musicians who wrote the whole book, and they just did not tell about what they didn't like (for example Miles Davis: they stop with ""Jack Johnson"", then say he had his midlife crisis in the 70's and returned with ""a wonderful album"" in about 1981 - nothing about ""Dark Magus"" and other masterworks from this era!).Maybe American readers are not interested in European musicians, but I think it is just fair to give them a place in this book, too (like Dieter Seelow, who lives almost next door to me).Get this book if you need an encyclopedia about jazz, although it is a bit unbalanced. A better one is ""Das Jazzbuch"" by Joachim Ernst Behrendt (?), but I didn't find it here because I could not spell his name and I don't know if there's an English translation."
4,Started out dark then got funny,"This book had the potential to be one of my favorite books in the first 50 pages - but then it got to be more funny than scary. I still enjoyed it, but it just wasn't 'dark' enough. The use of slang from the future made it kind of ridiculous and the fact that the book is really just one continuous chase scene with a helpless hero is pretty absurd too.You'll need to stretch your imagination quite a bit on some of the ideas but all in all it was fun. Jeter is very creative and original, this is kind of a funny version of _The Anubis Gates_ and also similar to Gaiman's _Neverwhere_ and _The Physiognomy_ from Jeffrey Ford."
3,"Highly Disappointed, but it is The Clark Sisters","Just like everyone else, I thought that the DVD was the live recording of The Clark Sisters. The ladies did sing well, however, everyone but Karen did not put enough emphasis and enthusiasm into their singing as they did with the CD performance. The DVD also did not have all of the songs that were on the CD. For example, ""Save my Soul, World, My Reedemer, and others. Futhermore, Twinkie did seem disinterested and was sitting down at the organ with her fingers on the keys but was not playing anything!!! How strange? Anyways, I am one of The Clark Sisters' biggest fans, so I would recommend buying the DVD because they will always have the voice. Unfortunately, I really wish that everyone would have taken inspiration from Karen and really allowed they spirit to move in the building."
2,LET'S START A PETITION!,"Look everyone who is reading this we all know that this DVD is horrible and not what some of us expected or wanted. We do know that this The actual recording was put on video because there have been 1 or 2 clips shown on various gospel shows, so with that in mind we should all flood EMI GOSPEL'S Mailbox requesting that they work out whatever the problem may be with the original video and put it to DVD I think we as the fans of the Clarks deserve it."
1,Total Garbage,"every thing was freaking fake, only thing real was Karen, Twinkie,dorinda, AND Jakie SINGING THERE SOLO'S,I was expecting the actual LIVE concert when it was first made with Donald Lawrence, and Calvin rogers,P.S, No im not a hater, i love the Clark sisters, and i gave them 5 stars on there cd review, but this DVD was not worth it, more so coming from a musician point of view, if your just a person who likes the songs and is not technical with every thing then you will really enjoy. but for those who know music, you will truly be disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I pre-ordered this DVD and I'll NEVER do that again. Next time I'll wait and read some reviews. This is a major disappointment. If you're going to have a dvd to correspond with a cd, at least make the dvd the SAME performance or BETTER than the original. This is not even on par with the original. :("
3,Ok Not To Buy... If you do be inspired by legacy not the production,"When I first open the DVD, I was expecting bouns features and all the other stuff. What I got was just the concert that they recorded on the Gospel Music Channel which is ok but I think they needed to have more element to it. I am a HUGE fan of all the clark sisters including (Denise a.k.a. Nesse) but I feel like the CD does a better last memory than the DVD which is great in its own right but buy the CD before the DVD. The reason is simple I was too much ""disappointed"" at the DVD's features but happy to have a little more of the Extrodinary Clark Legacy.I think that this DVD was annoited because of the Clark Sisters I just think that EMI Gospel did a horrible job of not giving more than the concert as they did with Dorinda's 1st DVD. Speaking of which when will ""The Rose of Gospel"" DVD be released its been what almost 3-4 years since the release.Overall, It was ok...."
4,excellent,"This is not a documentary, but it is an excellent example of historical fiction.Flawed, but still very engrossing and perhaps the most intriguing take on the legendary character.You may be dissapointed if you want porn and sadism.If you want a character study that provides insight into the heart, mind, and spirit of a tortured soul this is an excellent film."
3,Did we ever really know you Desade?,"To quote the man himself ""I have spanked a few bottoms"" Pretty well somes up this film. The review preceeding mine somes up what I have to say about this film. If you are interested in other films I reconmend marat/sade play set in a bathhouse and Quills a pretty strong work of fiction about the man."
4,I like these gloves,"I like these gloves, they are hard to put on if you have big wrists. They also kind of hard to fit over a jacket with zippers on the cluf. That why I gave it 4 stars.Also the seller spelled the item wrong and this review will never be read. Since I bought the last one"
3,Case is a tight fit on LX3 with Ricoh LC-1,"Let's face it, you can't expect anything too nice when paying less than $10 for a case AND a battery. The case provides adequate protection, though the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. Also, in stock form the case doesn't open far enough. This is easily remedied by cutting the fabric straps on each side. I will also mention that the case fits very tightly on myLX3when using theRicoh LC-1. However, it still works well and for the money I'll live with it.The battery seems perfectly adequate, but I haven't had much chance to compare it to the stock battery."
5,"Whoo Hoo, the queen of trash is back!","I have been waiting for this sequel to Queen of Denial to come out for over a year. Thank God it's finally in print, for I dearly need the laugh. Selina Rosen's work will shake you up, ruffle your hair, surprise you, make you laugh, make you think and probably depants you in process. Queen Drew is smart, sassy, bawdy, competent and surprisingly ethical. So pop open a cold one, or mix up a pitcher of hurling monkeys and enjoy yourself."
5,who says SF can't be funny?,"There's this old story about how humor doesn't work in science fiction. I don't know how many times I've heard it. The trouble is, there just aren't enough examples around to prove the story wrong. But this is good place to start.Rosen has written a character and put her in a situation that is bust-a-gut hilarious. It's broad comedy (no pun intended) and it works! I haven't laughed out loud at a book since I read Mark Twain. Wait...there's some Hunter S. Thompson I've laughed out loud at. Gonzo would indeed be a good adjective with which to describe Ms. Rosen. Among others.This is the follow-up to ""Queen of Denial"" which will also cause stomach pains. It's a cure to what ails you, if what ails you is a deep desire to read something funny that's also speculative that's also well-imagined that's also science fiction that's also funny--wait, I'm repeating myself I'm repeating myself...Buy this. Have some fun."
2,"OK hardware, BAD software","I purchased the Kworld DVD 2 maker to transfer movies from my DVR to DVDs. The price was good and the shipment prompt. Amazon is really good to deal with. After installing the included software (Cyberlink PowerDirector 8), hooking up the hardware the program failed to start. Reinstalled. No luck. Installed the included software (Cyberlink PowerProducer 5) was able to capture movies. But, PowerProducer would not burn a disc or produce a image of the movie on my hard drive. Technical support via of Cyberlink's web site provided no help. Cyberlink has mixed reviews across the internet for their products. Evidently their software is very sensitive to different computer configurations with some reviewers being happy and others like me extremely frustrated. Buy the Kworld DVD Maker but be prepared to also purchase image capturing software. Don't even load the Cyberlink junk."
1,Not entirely Vista compatible,"I ordered this product to convert my VHS tapes to DVDs after buying a new laptop with a writable DVD drive. After downloading the Vista driver available on KWorld's website, I continued to not be able to get the PVR-Plus function to work. Unfortunately, this is the element that converts the VHS into an mpeg format on the computer. While the other features did come up right away, this one wouldn't. After e-mailing KWorld directly I got a response 2 weeks later saying the PVR-Plus is not Vista compatible. However, I did try running the program in an XP-compatibility mode and was able to see the streaming, but now had poor audio feed. I switched the audio setting from microphone to line-in but continued to get poor results. I ultimately had to return the product."
2,Kworld USB Video Capture,"I used this device to copy my VHS collection to my hard drive so I could watch my video collection from the computer with the video ported to a TV. The installation and included software worked well, video image was good, but not great. The quality of the original VHS tapes was better, but I found the resulting MPEG2 files fully acceptable to watch. The capture went well for 118 movies (still have another 60 or so to do), then a very loud back ground noise of static was introduced into the files and is a constant input into the computer speakers even if I'm not recording. I've swapped out the VCR with another, recorded other tapes but the static only stops when I unplug this USB device. I've tried moving it around to see if the static lessened, but it never changes loudness or sound where ever it is. It appears this device has 'fried' its audio output."
1,Maybe I am just dumb,"I could not get this thing working. I am generally a technical person, working in the tech industry, but it is not working for me. Perhaps it is defective, there is a problem with my computer, or I am just plain dumb. In any case, it is not working for me and the documentation is no help at all."
3,Worked but not for long,"I payed over forty dollars when I bought it but I think this should only be around fifteen for the quality. Get something cheaper if you want a device like this, don't pay thirty or forty dollars for it."
1,"Don't go ""El Cheapo""","This unit is a wonderful plaything, howver, the results are jumpy and unplayable on several different players. I should have gotten a better system."
1,Decietful and Poor Quality,"The outside of the box says that the minimum system requirements is a Pentium IV with 1.6 GHz; HOWEVER, the user's manual (found inside the box) lists the requirements at 2.0 GHz minimum. Needless to say, this is a dishonest bait-and switch tactic, and should in no way be rewarded.Also, the user's manual only covered the installation of the driver; it included no instructions whatsoever as to the usage of the device. For example, have you been wondering what the button on the front does? There is nothing that explains it anywhere. Talk about poor quality!Lastly, the video quality was very poor, even on a brand new 3.8GHz machine. But this is a moot point. Don't support companies that use deciet and lies to sell products like this one."
1,"get dazzle DVD creator, don't go for this bargan crap","It doesn't work on vista, the video quality is horrible! sound is fine though.AVOID AS IF IT WAS THE PLAQUE!!"
3,mac compatable?,"hey just a question. is this hardware compatable with a mac? i dont need the software, i just download something, all i wanna do is play playstation 2 on my macbook. jus wanted to know if hardware is comaptable."
3,good product,"this cable works good, you just have to be careful with what you are doing at the installation setup, after you installed everything works good, playback its great and audio works good too"
3,Works only with a camera and VHS player,"I ordered this to put my family DVD,s on my computer and it wouldn'tsense the dvd player.I discovered that it will sense a vhs player, or a single video camera.If you connect this convertor to a video mixer output and connect to a computer, it also will not see this type of device.If your looking for a device to connect from your older video camera to your computer( your camera is older and doesn't have a usb connection)this will work great for you.If you are looking for a convertor for your vhs home movies, this will also work great for you.Don't use this is you are wanting to convert DVD's to a digiatl format on your hardrive."
3,Worth hassle for cheap price,Windows 7 tried to install drivers but they didn't work. I was unable to get the newest drivers from KWorld's website to work. It didn't work with Windows Movie Maker and I had to use their movie software which was not that intuitive and buggy. Their movie software kept complaining that MY home movies were copyrighted and would display an error message and stop recording among other quirks. Buggy. They also want you to pay money to upgrade to their newest version of the movie software perhaps to get rid of these bugs? It did however produce relatively decent videos and give the cheap price I was able to get it to work. For digitizing some home movies it was worth the price and hassle.
1,Don't waste your money,"It may work, but who knows how. Good luck trying to find any troubleshooting information either. I got everything installed, and then no audio would transfer. Then when I finally got audio, the transfer would freeze periodically. I didn't know until I went back and viewed the file as it appeared to still be transferring in the preview window. Also, it kept telling me the video was copyrighted. Don't know where it got that information from, since they were old home movies from the 80s and 90s. Anyway, wish I could return it, but unfortunately not sold by Amazon."
3,Reasonable setup,"I bought this as a replacement for the pinnacle moviebox which was supposed to do the same job, but actually totally screwed up my computer. Useless piece of junk - never buy pinnacle. This little gizmo however, was a little better. I had to use a separate input to capture the audio, hence the 3 stars, but it captured the video fine. Not perfect, but not bad."
5,Works,"I got the video going with no trouble, but there was no audio until I realized I had to plug the audio cable into the computer (duh). I use it on a Windows 2000 box with 2GB ram and a 1.8 GB processor. Works fine, but for the higher quality record modes a faster processor might help with dropped frames. Works just fine for my converting old VHS tapes of family events to DVD."
4,plug it in,"The USB 2800 DVD maker has gotten a bad rap because of the lack of clear installation instructions. Here's the way to plug this bad boy (device) in, and it will work and the sound will blast. Assuming you have a computer, a VCR and recorded tape: install computer driver; then plug red, white and yellow RCA connection cords that come with VCR into Out sockets on VCR and the other end of RCA cords into device. Put device mini plug into Line IN port ( light blue) on back of computer. USB cord plugs into USB port on computer. That's it for install! With XP (some issues may exist with Visa) go to Movie Maker and click on Video Device and you are off and running. Don't forget to start VCR and play tape. How's that for simple?"
1,Not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit,It arrived quickly. Item was new but it did not install the supplied driver on my Windows 7 64-bit. BEWARE: do not attempt to install driver without the adapter being plugged in....I got BSD. Downloaded newer driver from the manufacturer site. It claims to be working with Win 7 64-bit but is does not. Does not install and the device is not recognised. Sent this thing back the same day I received it.
1,no sound,"Excellent on transfer video, but sound was horrible. Was able to copy DISH DVR programs to my computer but the sound was static and poor quality. Tried with two laptops - same results."
4,Nice but..,"It works, definitely, and it captures video well. However, I didn't like the limited number of options to capture (VCD, SVCD, SDVD, DVD, MPEG/2/4, and AVI). And when it captured video, it made the file so horribly big it was crazy. I tried lowering the settings, but then the quality was just bad and the file was only slightly smaller. Meh. It captures video well, but still...more software/capture options would have been nice."
4,Question,I really like the product. Seems to work well especially at the price I got it for. Does anyone know how to get around the copyright so I can backup my library?
1,Poor product don't buy,"Installed, brought up, activated, crashed operating system (XP)hard requiring forced turnoff and restart of computer. Got no satisfaction at all from support. after multiple times that they told me to reinstall(every communication told me this) which I did even though I informed them that this was of no value. Sent them everything they asked for and after the last go round they just stopped communicating (nearly 2 months now). I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PURCHASE this product."
3,stressful setup,"I spent nearly a week unsuccessfully trying to capture audio from a VHS tape - (the video was good). I finally installed PowerDirector7 which came with the device. This uninstalled the PowerProducer5 which was bundled with the ""drivers"" CD. By selecting ""TV"" as the input source and plugging the audio jack to the front panel microphone I now get both audio and video as a .mpg file although there was no sound to the speakers. I never tried the audio ""line-in"" because accessing the rear of my computer involves moving a ton of furniture! the quality is not great, but I'm still playing with that. what griped me the most was the nearly complete lack of useful documentation and no solutions on any website or user forum. I would recommend trying both software programs and audio input methods and decide which works best for you. good luck!"
3,I throughy enjoyed this Item,Great Item...Easy Install....Just add the drivers.....works well with nero and microsoft movie maker.Great quality.I have had many vhs tapes that needed uploading and this Item seems to be up for the job...Great with windows xp...Best decision I made today was buying this product....
4,Great for the price.,"I got this to do video capture of game play footage for video games, specifically, LittleBigPlanet for upload to YouTube to plug my levels. Worked smoothly without any frames dropped. All in all great purchase for the price. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have an HDMI connections for HD. Get this!"
3,misleading,"A good selection but the back cover erroneously says that the book contains ""the complete text of The Sheltering Sky"". In fact there is only a 60 page excerpt."
2,Sizing is way off....,"Sizing on this site and shipper's site is inaccurate...go one size up. Quick shipping, but doesn't really matter, since I'm going to have to return it to get a new size."
2,Way too small!,"I had the opposite problem as the other reviewer--on my (small for her breed) Newfoundland, the skunk tail started about her waist!! I added 1' worth of black material and stapled velcro to keep the tail around hers, but it was ridiculous. Way too small. Adorable though! So hard to find outfits large enough for Giant breeds."
2,"Cute costume, but not worth the price","My dog is long in length but has a thinner torso, so this costume was right in length but way too big around her neck and body. The costume also came with some rips in the material around the stripe in the back. I contacted the company to get an exchange for a Large and told them about the tears in material and they were easy to work with. Two weeks later, the costume still had not arrived. When I called back, they told me they were out of Larges - so why didn't they just tell me that in the first place? My money was refunded, but now I am stuck with an X-Large skunk costume with rips and no Halloween costume for my dog."
2,X-Large is NOT X-Large,"I didn't read the review that someone else posted... and I wasted $20. They won't take returns and we received it only to read the back that lists dogs that are more in the 40 lb range for the X-Large size costume. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed, can't return it and it won't fit my 80lb German Shepherd puppy.... Sizing information would've really been helpful."
3,Too small,"I got the x-large, and it was still too small for my 82 pound dog. Further, the skunk tail doesn't have a loop on it, or anything that will help you keep it straight on your dog's back (you know, by putting it over the tail). So the costume keeps shifting from side to side, sometimes completely winding up upside down. I spent most of Halloween night, adjusting his costume. Sure he was funny looking and all, but it was a hassle."
2,Cute but won't stay on,"I thought this costume was really cute in the picture. I have an 11 month old female golden retriever, not yet fully grown, so to be sure it would fit I ordered the XL. It absolutely did NOT fit. It was way too short, so the tail of the skunk was laying on the middle of her back. The front fit alright around her head but because the costume was too short overall, it kept pulling back thus the skunk ears were on my dog's neck. There also isn't enough velcro to secure the costume onto the dog and the one velcro strap that goes under the belly was too big. I could not keep the costume on my dog at all while she was walking around.This costume is more for a large breed but with a short torso and big waist."
1,Too Small,The sizing of this costume is wrong! It does not fit my runt sized skinny American Bulldog or my Husky. I am really disappointed!
3,Good product,This product seemed like decent quality. I had a hard time trying to figure out what size to get my dog and in the end I managed to get it on him for a picture but that was it. It's definitely not going to fit every dog (including mine!). If you dog has a tail that rounds up especially be careful of this costume.
3,Bad print for an otherwise good textbook.,"The book is a classic in the field; it's well written and clear, with interesting problems. However, the Publisher chose very tiny fonts, sometimes lacking in toner. Overall they did a terrible print, hard to read!"
3,Not Timoshenko,"I was looking for something similar to Timoshenko's ""Theory of Elasticity."" This was not it. I am a working mechanical engineer. This book is aimed at the physicist/student. It is 200 pages long and crammed full of tensors. They also hit on waves and liquid crystals. I may or may not keep this book."
1,sticks to everything it shouldn't,Was given this rolling pin as part of a pie making set. It's awful. The pie dough stuck to it constantly. Finally gave up and went back to my wooden rolling pin. I'll never use this one again.
2,Ocean Kayak Review,I bought this transducer for my new Ocean Kayak. I was disappointed to see it comes with 30 feet of cable. Humminbird and Ocean Kayak are owned by the same parent corporation. Ocean Kayak modified the scupper holes of many models specifically for this Humminbird transducer. How hard would it be for Humminbird to measure the distance for the longest possible install distance and provide the right amount of cable???? I thought I was buying a well thought out solution. I got 20 plus feet of clutter.
2,Long and Dull...,"Let me start by saying, I bought this book because of all the great reviews it got here. So, I thought I'd better give my opinion too, since it is so different!This book includes everything you'd ever want to know about Garbo! So, it's great for the fan of hers who wants to know absolutley every detail about her. However, it is not written in an interesting way. It is like reading a ""G"" encyclopedia that is all about Garbo! It is long, boring, and difficult to read because the facts of her life are just layed out in chronological order. Not very engaging to read. I kept putting it down and reading other books, then going back to it."
4,One of the best biographies I've ever read,"I have always been a fan of books about movies, film stars and anything related to Holywood Golden Years, the era of the big studios and stellar actors and actresses who still are an essential part of our iconic world today. This Greta Garbo bio has utterly surprised me for its objective point of view, its love for detail without falling into boring accounts, its accurate psychological approach of the woman -yet not forgetting about her magnificent talent as a performer. Throughout its pages you can breath the glamourous life of Holywood's inhabitants in the 1930s and '40s, know the twisted way MGM worked, feel the ordinary worries and vital insatisfaction of Greta Gustafsson.I recommend this book to all of you willing to know what can be known for sure, to all those who don't like being told a story that only really happened in the author's mind. Take form me -I've read a lot of this sort of bios."
3,Welcome to the schizophrenic reveiws,"I will begin with the following disclaimer: I did not finish reading this book. While my inability to finish a book ought to automatically speak for how I feel about this book, I give it a decent rating based on the fact that it is well written by a master of prose. My main problem with the book was that it was awfully slow, a tedium that eventually led to my throwing the book down when I received as a gift a much more appealing book. The reviews on this site belie the fact that some of you will love it and others will be tremendosuly bored by it. I , as well as my friend, are solidly in the latter of these two groups. The best I can say is that it does tell a little of a land few of us really know anything about and the author won the Nobel prize for Literature. That might be enough for some people but it certainly was not for me."
3,rich descriptions relieve the tedium,"This is a colorful fairy tale that richly interweaves the story of the building of a convent with the lives of Portugese royalty and two peasant characters, Baltasar and Blimunda. This book was highly recommended to me by someone who knows I love history. Saramago's descriptions are indeed full and rich and he succeeds in bringing some aspects of the 18th century vividly to life. I found the novel a bit too long however, sometimes bordering on tedium. At times it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Though a solid piece of work by Saramago, I think V. S. Naipaul is a much finer writer and the latter's continuing lack of a Nobel a scandal of growing proportions."
3,"decent, but trying","the book is worth reading if you have time. Saramago departs from most contemporary fiction with his more omniscient, somewhat outdated style of writing. For being so historical, the book is highly fantastical ( a flying maching driven by human will?) but interesting to read. The book does not explain the characters and their motivations. Baltasar and Blimunda fall in love at first sight, and it is never explained why they stay together in such a dramatic fashion. Moreover, the characters are too mysterious and too much of strangers to be fun to read about..."
2,The Lemons Of Dudlow...,"A haunted piano (!) arrives in the small town of Ludlow, just in time for the bicentennial celebration. Weirdness ensues, as descendants of the town's founders wind up murdered in horrible ways. A little girl appears to many victims, along with a group of ""demons"", who look an awful lot like ordinary people in old clothes, who kill-kill-KILL! The piano itself is possessed by an old warlock named Ephram Ludlow. Ephram had his hands cut off and wants them back! With it's half-hearted acting and drama-school special effects, DEMONS OF LUDLOW is nothing spectacular. I give it 2 stars because a couple of the death scenes were semi-interesting..."
2,Puzzling,The quality of the material is poor. Very thin puzzle pieces. Cut quality is poor with many pieces stuck together. I had to punch out a lot of the backing from the holes just to put the pieces together.The best thing about this product is the nice variety of the puzzle pieces shapes and sizes. Too bad the quality does not match up.
1,Father Forgive Them For They No Not What They Do,"In the Words of the precious Lord and Saviour that is spoken about in over 300 prophesies in the Holy Scriptures and came to set us free from sin I quote from His Words from the cross "" Father Forgive Them For They No What They Do"". I believe those Words are appropriate in describing the whole content and intent of this film. By trying to discredit His Life and Mission it just reaffirms by trying to do this it just strengthens ones belief because of the lack of integrity in presenting the facts in an objective manner. Read the gospels and compare and come to your own conclusion. The Gospels are historical documents and this production has many flaws and inconsistances which totally take out of context and creates its own agenda because of its falsehoods. Read the Gospels and judge for yourself."
5,Jefferson Starship Rocks Once Again!,"I posted a review some time ago, but I just wanted to add that I still keep listening to ""Windows of Heaven"" and haven't gotten bored with it yet. If you like Jefferson Airplane and the earlier incarnation of JS, I'm quite sure that you will enjoy this recording. There's even a track that has Grace Slick! Also, JS tours fairly frequently, so check out their web site for concert dates and locations."
2,"OK, but put Diana up front and I'll give it 5 stars","The truly awesome vocalist that is Diana Mangano, if given the chance, could really elevate the band to heights never before witnessed here on Earth. Please nuture this wonderful vessel of beauty, charm and talent the next effort out, or respectfully give her the freedom to express her creativity...and guys, please stop singing - you should back HER up, not the other way around!"
4,A Star Warrior Portrait,"This book presents one aspect of the Strategic Defense Initiative: namely, the role of Edward Teller in the formation of X-ray lasers and Smart Pebbles. If you are looking for general coverage of SDI, this book is probably not for you. However, this book does present the Teller angle thoroughly and well. It portrays the scientist and his actions in the context of his psyche, the political environment in which he operated, and through the eyes of the scientists who participated in the program.The reader will come away from this book with a much better appreciation for the factors that went into some of the major decisions affecting SDI. Broad covers the technical aspects of his subject matter, without alienating those of us who are not nuclear physicists, which I suspect represents a large percentage of the population."
4,Cigarette Art when Smoking was King,"I'm not a habitual cigarette smoker, but I'm a sucker for vintage packaging design, as well as books about such design. This medium-sized ""coffee table"" book is well produced and would be an inspiration to anyone interested in graphic design, typography, advertising, and of course smoking. Anthropologists may also be interested in the use of similar icons (i.e. airplanes, reclining women and tigers) that pop up on cigarette packages from a wide range of different countries/cultures. It's a sad thing that you don't find such sumptuous art on cigarette packages anymore - this book shows that the golden age of cigarettes (and also of product design) is long gone. But I'm glad it's being showcased in this book to share with later generations!"
3,"Please, can someone open a window here!","OK, so the fancy packaging is cool, but aren't we trying to get rid of all the cigarette and tobacco advertisements through commercials and other ads? ""A Branded World"" by Michael Levine defines the real meaning of branding to make a company successful without the smoky mess. Once you've read ""A Branded World"" you will find yourself inhaling, ""finally, a book worth reading."""
4,Good but not great.,This probably Walls of Jerichos worst album to date but its still not bad. Which should show you how great this band really is. They just keep getting better with each album release.
4,Good in its genre but not what I prefer,"I was recommended Walls Of jericho by a friend who told me it was kickass music.It is.Candace is a really good vocalist and the music really fills you up with rage and energy.This is really good hardcore metal music.Nevertheless I'd still prefer the likes of Otep or Queen Adreena but this is pure matter of taste.On this record,I genuinely enjoyed the 3rd track ""changing times"" and,pity, it's also the shortest one...But maybe I'll check out their sophomore effort though."
5,"Little crackers, big taste, low calories",Love these mini crackers for hummus and other dips. Flavor is perfect - not overpowering.
4,Good targets,Good all around targets for pistols on an practice basis.Decently bright bull's eye offers plenty of room for shooting data for serious shooters.I find them a good value for the money would make a good vital area cover for a used silhouette.
4,rocko's modern life,this is a very good video! you will really like it. it has a few of the episodes where rocko and his friends fall in love with people!
1,Big disappointment. Not recommended.,"This comic, romantic, suspense story was NONE of the above. The humor is certainly forced; the attraction sounds like good ol' lust; and the suspense can put you to sleep.Has anyone else noticed that Georgiana talks like she belongs in the Victorian era--that is, when she isn't busy doing a good imitation of a parrot? And that, for a supposedly mature, 37-year old financial wizard, Cole sure acts more like a kid out on a joyride?I think SS should stick to writing historical romances. Her ""Desert Rogue"" was much better."
1,BORING,"COLEMAN AND GEORGIANA WERE SO UN-BELIEVALBE. THE ARTHOR MADE GEORGIANA SOUND LIKE A FIVE YEAR OLD. SHE WAS 29 YEARS OLD AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT MAKE UP. PLEASE. COLEMAN WASN'T MUCH BETTER. NOT ONLY THE STORY SOUNDED A LOT LIKE ""ROMANCE THE STONE"" EVEN THE TRUCK'S NAME WAS BESSIE. THE STORY HAD NO WIT, NO SIZZLE, NO HUMOR. IT TOOK VERY BIT OF MY POWER TO FINISH THE BOOK."
1,Don't bother,Very inexpensive and you get what you pay for. Impossible to get consistently good flares. Dificult to get brace lined up due to slop in machining.
2,not what I was looking for,"I purchased this book to read orally to students in my classroom on the advice of a ""teacher-suggested"" lesson plan I was using to teach elementary students research. It's very wordy with more details than I found necessary. I did not read it to my class - felt they would be bored to tears.. individual students though might enjoy reading it.."
5,Wouldn't bath without it!,Houston water has all kinds of things in it. This does the job without the big expense of more complicated systems.
3,Not bad,"If you are a Babylon 5 fan you will want to see it. Not great, but you might want to see it and add it to your collection. The first disc which I purchased from Amazon was not properly recorded -- skipped, was distorted. They sent me a second copy which was O.K."
1,Off the mark...,Legend of the Rangers was a true disapointment. I consider myself a huge fan of B5 and the Rangers carried enormous respect. The theme on this that there is a group a misfits that can do some great things when they overcome their unruly behaviors seemed more like chasing the popularity of FarScape. A ranger spin-off could have been cool if it maintained the same dignity as B5's version. The rangers lived for the one and died for the one. They were not whiny misfits. I enjoyed FarScape but seperately from this. It just could never be the same and most certainly didnt have to be.
4,The Rangers. Possibilities.,"This was a new approach to build on the origional series, and over-all was enjoyable. I liked the hard decisions that had to made by the main character to survive, and the martial arts training scenes. Effects as always were great and the plot was good. I found the aspect of the gunner girl weaving around blasting and yelling in the firing chamber some-what beyond the way this advancement in technology could have been handled, but if that was my only criticism, then it was enjoyable viewing. Could have been expanded to some sort of mini-series perhaps? The option as always was there. No problem adding this to my B5 collection. Give it a go!"
2,"Had Promise, but Failed to Deliver.","I have to agree with the other reviewers. ""Legend of the Rangers"" looked promising but ultimately didn't deliver. The sets and effects are excellent and the actinng's not bad. And of course it was great seeing Andreas Katsulas reprise his role as Narn ambassador, now citizen, G'Kar, however these three elements couldn't save the film. The mysterious alien race threatening the Liandra's crew were too much like the Shadows of the series.If you're a die-hard B-5 fan you'll want this film, but if you're looking for an introduction to B-5 go with the season box sets.All-in-all not JMS' best. Which is sad because it had promise."
2,Disappointing release in an otherwise great series,"This DVD is by no means up to the standards set by the other Babylon 5 discs. The picture quality is VHS-grade at best, with obvious analog chroma noise (""rainbow snow"") throughout - particularly noticable in darker scenes such as the Grey Council. I've checked this by playing it on a PC and it is clearly in the recorded content and not a playback issue.It is also the most expensive on a dollar/content basis - $14 for a single special with no extras whatsoever (not even a paper insert with a chapter list), versus $50 for a slick boxed set of the other 5 specials, with various bonus features and a booklet. While this might be unavoidable due to its seperate release, it does make the poor quality even less excusable."
2,Best for completists only,"It's nice stepping back into the B5 universe again and this is the last of the original content that had yet to appear on DVD (excluding the original version of the pilot episode that exists only on VHS tapes everywhere.)It's interesting as the final piece of the B5 puzzle. The acting is terrible, the plot is OK, the special effects are consistent with the old series but look dated by modern standards.Andreas Katsulas, as usual, is fantastic and his short scenes are the only thing to reccomend this movie. In the end this is the last of B5 and a partial bridge to Crusade. If you're a B5 fan then it belongs on your bookshelf. Otherwise? probably not."
4,Could have spawned a great series,"I enjoyed the film a great deal, as it gives us another aspect of the B5 universe, a new dynamic within the Rangers, and a final great performance by Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar. No, ""The Legend Of The Rangers"" does not replicate the greatness of the preceeding five seasons of Babylon 5--- but how could it?? It is an unfair comparison. Sci-Fi fans are exceedingly tough critics by nature, but honestly, most of these reviews are too harsh. This film was the pilot to a series for the Sci-Fi Channel which, unfortunatly, never happened. A terrible loss. B5 is about solid storytelling, and I have no doubt that J. Michael Straczynski would have given us much to think, laugh, and cry about had Sci-Fi given him the chance to develop the series. ""Crusade"" had the same potential... I, for one, am grateful that we have these additional chapters of the B5 universe."
4,Good Movie,"This is a good movie because it allows us to see the G'Kar character progress into a later time after the Babylon 5 series. It is not clear exactly what year this takes place, but I think it is after the Drakh plague is cured from the Crusade series, so I would say it would have to be about 2270. I think it was supposed to start a series about the Rangers whose entire story was never told. The DVD is as cheap as they come. It has absolutely no extras. It has no commentary. I think they could have done a better job on the DVD."
3,Not the best,"I would have liked to see where this could have gone. I liked the concept; however, I felt there were to many plot holes. First of all, when did the Grey Council get involved in disciplining Rangers? Wasn't that left to Ranger One? Also, what was with the somewhat manual weapons system? Weird. Sad to say it was hard to watch and I can see why it didn't get much traction. I love the B5 universe and have this DVD in my collection; however, this one will probably get a little dusty."
3,Not as good as any other B-5 episode or movie.,"It is always great to watch B-5, and learn more about the incredible universe JMS has created. And while we did get some of that here, especially concerning the new, more open Ranger corp, the story is very unlikely and seemingly contradictory. If this ""new"" race was so powerful, why were they tricked, and defeated, so easily? And, of course, there were many more of them than just the one ship they destroyed. What happened to them? Was this a potential primer for a spin off? Maybe, but in the movie, it didn't come off very well. B-5 is great, this movie was good, but it was rather dissappointing in the B-5 universe."
4,Legend of the Rangers Review,"It was amazing, could have been better and am glad that I purchased it as it now completes my collection of all the B5 movies and series."
4,Should have developed into its own series,I liked this in general as an opener for the Rangers and their philosophy of live for the one die for the one. This would have been a good lead in for a new series from the Babylon 5 Universe.
2,Worst movie or show with Babylon 5 theme,"Acting in pilots is often not up to par with the show that follows, and this pilot is no exception - the acting is terrible. What makes this pilot truly awful is the weapon systems control. One is forced to cringe every time there is a fire fight which is often the highlight of other space Sci-Fi action movies. The ranger rule of not fleeing from fights is taken to extreme in this pilot turning most of them into kamikaze idiots rather than brave knights.The scenes with G'Kar are the only good thing about this pilot."
3,Like the original pilot for Babylon 5...,"the promise of better things where hinted at. Killed in the crib due to ""syfy"" wussies who didn't like the ratings it pulled in. Typical.. typical.. typical."
1,LackLuster,"Like most people on the reviews i Love Babylon 5, I almost bought the DVD's when they had like 2-4 episodes on a DVD for like $30. When i heard this was coming on Sci-fi I was excited, until i watched it. The graphics where fine the Ships where not like the rest of the ship designs in the B5 Universe. The main ship was a FLYING BRICK? elegant i think not? Plot nope not good... Just wish crusade kept running."
3,"Not so great, but watchable","Very slow start and weak acting, also a fairly inconclusive ending. Improves significantly about halfway through. I'm a great fan of B5, particularly of the Rangers, and this was somewhat disappointing. A little like a methadone session for a heroin addict."
3,Mediocre,"As a spin off of Babylon 5, this is not up to snuff with the rest of the series with respect to plot or acting."
3,Nice Try,"This was a nice try at extending the Babylon 5 story line but it just didn't quite get things right. The story itself was a good one, but the script needed a little more development and the actors should've been a little more experienced. The special effects are on par with Bab 5, good marks there but the fire control system the woman operated on board the Liandra(sp)? That was ridiculous. A great pleasure to see G'kar(Andreas Katsulas) once again, a great actor and variety of characters which will be greatly missed. Not a bad investment for a collector and fan of the Babylon 5 series and offshoots."
1,"Not even ""so bad it;s good""...","Truly the worst moment in the B5 franchise. Bad acting, bad story, cliche beyond belief. Not even recommended for completists. What were they thinking? They made G'Kar into a flamboyant, lispy homosexual, just short of wearing a feather boa (or did he?)..."
3,"In The Being, while....","It was descent, I didn't fine myself wanting to read the rest of the book like I did with his other book Thridspace. As the book says "" In The Being"", tell about the events that made Babylon 5, which was the Earth-Minbari War. In there it tell you about the events that made that war come to past, but it wasn't that good because if you were a hard-core fan of the show or somebody who watch it a lot you knew many of the things that were metion it it. While it did have some elements that won't even talk about in the movie or the show that to me were it only saving grace. I think that both the novel and the move could of haddle this thing a litte better, for this thing talk about a major element in the show that make everything in the show the way that is now. I fell like that I was watching a movie that I would watch in my histroy class. Somewhat good, but in the long run a little broing to see again. END"
4,BABYLON 5 CONTINUED?,"I saw this pilot when it was first released. I enjoyed the entire BABYLON 5 series and was sorry to see it come to a close. I was very impressed with this PILOT and was hoping to see it as a series. I would have rated it as a 5 if it had continued! But even though it didn't make it, I'm glad to have it in my collection."
1,I can see why its a series that never was...,"Whats to say. If I had to hear, 'We live for the one, we...'yada yada yadaHonestly, it may have gotten better if allowed to go forward but LOTR cast, story premise and acting just wasn't up to par with B5. When I say that I mean it wasn't even in the same league. Although, season 1 of B5 sucked and I can't see why it wasn't cancelled. It wasn't until season 3 (John Sheridan's watch) that I began to watch it. I later went back and viewed season 2 which I also enjoyed and became a big Babylon 5 fan. But season 1 sucked! Okay where was I? Oh yeah, Legend of the Rangers sucked twice!!!"
1,This thing sucked!,"I loved B5 and Crusade. I hated this. Well, maybe hate is too strong a word. I strongly disliked it.I'm gonna make this short and sweet.The plot stunk. The idea a race as old and powerful as they presented in the pilot could've gone un-noticed by the ""first ones"" and not have an influence in the Shadow wars of the original B5 series is completely ludicris to me.The acting was far from normal B5 universe quality. That hologram targeting system thing was totally and completely disaterous. Gawd awful!!!The story never went anywhere. The whole time I was waiting for the movie to progress. It never did.The special effects where fantastic though. A+ work there."
3,Get Ready for Babylon 5: The Lost Tales,"Like Crusade, Legend of the Rangers was another unsuccessful attempt to jumpstart the stalled B5 franchise. The production values on Legend were higher than those on Crusade, and this time, instead of being leftovers from the Shadow War, the villains were some kind of super-Shadow called ""the Hand"" which was supposedly even more ancient and powerful than the Shadows, the Vorlons, or any of the other Old Ones. I guess Lorien just neglected to mention them. Zog! One of the main strengths of B5 was continuity and the Hand was the biggest continuity violation in the B5 universe, not the greatest basis for a new series. I suppose that if the series had caught on, JMS would have eventually revealed that the Hand was all a lie made up by the Drakh. ZOG!!!"
3,Pretty decent,"Good effects make this film which was obviously made as a pilot to pitch a new series, quite watchable.There are three problems. Dylan Neal is miscast. You can tell who the bad guy is, too easily. JMS has got to find a better ploy that fining evidence of a very old race that is exceedingly evil.Still, it was good to see G'Kar again."
1,Worst B5 EVER!!!,"This awful entry in the usually wonderful Babylon 5 series is truly attrocious. Its crimes run the gamut from bad acting, to stumbling meandering plot, unneccessary uber powerful alien beings of the week, zero chmeistry between the cast and the all time worst moment in the entire film and the B5 universe in general - I defy you to watch the scene where the female gunnery officer hops into the full environment weapons system and proceeds to Kung Fu and scream her way through a firefight and not laugh yourself into a frenzy of tears and frustration. Absolute unintentional comedy gold much to the detriment of this movie.But in fact don't watch it, avoid this mess and do yourself a favor and stick to the regular series. JMS should have known better."
3,"B5 : TLOTR , an afternoon movie","It is certainly not great but I liked some of it. I liked the presence of G'Kar, he has some funny lines in it. Also the captain is good to watch.The girl as a ""weapon"" hangin' there was of course ridiculous, that really bothered me, that JMS could think B5 fans would like that.I always see someting good in it as long as it is in the B5 Universe.So, in this case, a nice Sunday afternoon movie."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible.",I'm a huge fan of the series and popped this into my cart to get free shipping for the first Lost Tales DVD. What a mistake!Lets just say that no-where near the full potential of the rangers was realised in this one. Don't go here!
1,worst. episode. ever.,"How could one of the best sci-fi shows on television at the time spawn such a wretched, lackluster offspring? Oh yeah, remember ""Galactica 1980""? NOW it all makes sense."
4,B5 Legend of the Rangers,A good story for those who have enjoyed the Babylon 5 series. The Interstellar Alliance again calls on the Ranger's to investigate an alien force that has appeared and is a possible threat to the alliance.
3,Good movie/trailer,"I like the movie it is pretty well made, except for the combat scenes the kung fu Virtual reality attack stuff is a bad joke. Other then that it has a decent plot and more like a pilot episode."
4,Wonderful,"I thought this was a wondeful tangent to the Babylon world. As a Babylon-5 fan, I really enjoyed it."
1,I bought this - I want my money back!!!,"This was absolutely awful. My wife and I gritted our teeth hoping it would get better. We're both Bab5 fans and have watched all the seasons more than once on DVD. When it was over we were both relived (that it was over) and angry (that it was so horrid, and that we paid money for it). Quite frankly, I feel ripped off."
1,Babylon 5 has gone really downhill,"This movie was by far the worst Babylon 5 installment. Where the series and previous movies were well thought out, Legend of the Rangers seemed geared towards a younger audience. Visions of Babylon 5 meets Power Rangers was what stuck in my mind as I watched. I couldn't recommend this show to anyone, even if I disliked them."
2,You can't go back again,"I miss Babylon 5. I miss J. Michael Straczynski. As it has been said by other reviewers: the weapons system controlled by a woman in a virtual reality chamber was pretty ridiculous. And the writing was awful. It's like they tried to hit every note that was in the full 5 years of B5 in one desperate story. I got the feeling it was written by committee...a committee formed of people who saw the series as homework and came up with this script in an all-nighter. I'm afraid we have to just let B5 go, and enjoy our DVD's."
2,Disappointing,"It does not hold true to the quality we (B5 fans) expect from Babylon 5. G'Kar's dialogue, rather than capturing the depth and likeability of his character, seems artificial, forced, and lame. He has been turned into a comic relief character, and made to spew trite one-liners that G'Kar on Babylon 5 would never have said. I remember him saying something similar to, ""Love to stay. Can't. Have to go. Kiss kiss, bye bye."" That, and other scenes (like one in which the weapons girl destroys a mine field by screaming and flailing her limbs around in some kind of impractical, immersive, interactive targeting room) make me feel embarrassed for the movie and the franchise, rather than proud of it.Don't get me wrong, I'm a hard-core B5 fan, and you can bet that I've already pre-ordered The Lost Tales. But this particular piece of the B5 world is very disappointing, and I don't recommend it for anyone, B5 fans or otherwise."
2,For Completists Only,"Strengths: Soundtrack by Christopher Franke, performance by Andreas Katsulas in 1st half. Interesting idea of weapons system.Weaknesses: Plot was mostly stupid. Tragic underutilization of G'Kar as a character in the second half. Unconvincing sense of scale for the Leanndra (Why call for ""a healer""? How many healers are on board this tiny ship?). Felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie."
2,Disappointing Spinoff,"This ""movie"", which was obviously meant to be a pilot but was aired as a stand-alone feature, lacks nearly everything that made Babylon 5 a great show. It's set in the same universe and contains the same races and ships, but the plotting feels like, well, a failed pilot.G'Kar's scenes in ""Rangers"" are an embarassment to the character. After a spectacular sendoff on the original B5 series, he re-enters the universe apparently having regressed two or three seasons' worth of character development. There is no reason for him to be present except to spout off some gratuitous quotes from Babylon 5 and remind us that we are watching a B5 show.Overall, this show would be without much value if it stood alone. As an episode of the B5 mythos, it is worth even less."
3,"Good service, questionable quality.","The above stool came in as expected and was easy to assemble, but after it had been in the shower for about a week, I noticed there were some rust spots where the legs sat on the shower floor even though there are rubber pads on the ends. The teak also seemed to develop an unpleasant odor. Right now the stool is out on the porch drying out. I guess the water is entering the legs where the adjustment holes are, but I don't know how to solve the problem."
1,Lousy,This is a terrible product. I may have to consider requesting a refund. The wood peels (I am questioning the integrity of this teak wood). It is also falling apart. Lousy product!
1,not a teak wood product,"We purchased the chair a week ago and we are returning it.It sat in our shower whole week and it started peeling,it has an odor also.it is not teak wood..or perhaps the cheapest grade of teak wood.Do not buy!!!! We also purchased the teak mats and it is as badas the chair."
3,shower stool,The stool serves the purpose for which I purchased it for.However it is a little bigger than I expected it for my stand upshower stall. And I was not advised not to use scrubbing bubbles onit so now the stain is coming off the stool.Teak Adjustable Height Bath Stool Bench Shower Chair - FREE SHIPPING
1,DO NOT BUY!,"How do I get hold of the company who makes this cheap seat? It ""somehow"" acquired two stains on the top that won't come off and the legs are wobbly and leave rust on the floor of the shower. It looked and sounded good, but we are very dissatisfied and want to return it. We bought it in Oct of '10 so are we STUCK WITH IT??"
2,Broke within two months.,We had this chair about two months and the wood split in two places. We decided not to try and glue it back together and threw it away. We ended up getting one with a plastic seat.
4,Stool works well for purpose,"After the bad reviews that I read on this product, I was very leery of buying it. I have to say, I have not encountered any problems with it. It is slightly wobbly, but for the price you cant expect it to be perfect. It looks nice and serves its purpose."
4,"Good preparation for the AP Exam...hey, I passed!","This book walks you through several different types of exercises that may appear on the exam, as well as explains how the test writers think. It is relatively cheap, too, for an AP test prep book, and gives readers practical experience with realistic tests. I used this book, halfway paid attention in class, and managed to exempt American History at a major university."
4,I loved this book at a child,"I received this as a Christmas present in 1975. I read it till the cover fell apart. In the past decade I've read his other books.He is whiny, complaining, ungrateful, and arrogant as only a sixteen year old boy can be. I see little evidence that this changed as he entered his thirties. He has squandered several small fortunes. He clearly has trouble with mental disorders including depression. Truly, he has been carried by his wife for decades.Still, his was a fascinating adventure and one I still find compelling. This book focused in me a love of adventure which has lasted to this day."
1,Second-hand trash,"Rarely has anyone produced such a work of nothingness. No doubt hoping to cash in on the success of similarly titled books, Dryden shows his true colours as a second-rated copyist. Dr Forrest Justice-Dayton"
3,"It works with my 700wx, but the cables are SHORT","It does work with my 700wx from Sprint. That is the good news.BUT, the power cable is about 28 inches long. Not even long enough to reach under my desk to the powerstrip if the unit is sitting on the desk. And the AC adapter is NOT the same one that comes with your unit (so you HAVE to use the one supplied). The AC Adadpter also has a funky shape that forces it to take 2-3 slots on your power strip (it is REALLY wide).If the unit had just used the power card that came with the phone it would have been much better. And how often do you see a USB cable longer than a power cord? Very odd."
5,"Terra Skye, I believe this is love!","This is one of the best slightly down-tempo trance songs that I have heard in a while. If you like Robin Fox(""I See Stars""&""It's Gonna Be O.K.""), then you will love this song. Producer/remixer Ford worked his magic on this awesome track, just as he did with Robin Fox's smash-hit singles. This song has very similar beats, laser-like synth efx, awesome echoes, and vocoded vocals. But, the lyrics are the real winner. Terra's ""Oh my god's"" are as hot as she is! This label, Nebulous Records, is blowin' up with great talent like Plummet(""Damaged"", Mon-A-Q(Feel the Rhythm), and of course, Terra. I recommend picking up the LP or CD maxi-single, which is out now, and checking out anything else this bangin' label has to offer. If you are from my area, you can checkout the CD ""United Breakz of America"" by DJ's Mooch & Crak @ TUNZ that includes this sweeeeeet song. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
4,Nice single. Reminds me of early 4 strings,"This particular single is pretty enjoyable. It is not an example of the bouncy eurobeat style of groups like Cascada. A better comparison would be the vocal trance style of 4 Strings (circa their Believe album). While this is not better than the best work from 4 Strings, it is a nice song, beautiful ethereal female vocal that is strong at times but also floats above the synths."
4,Great Christmas Reading,"I enjoyed all of the stories - except one, which I didn't even read. Edith Layton's story ""The Dogstar"" is the second of a series of stories about some very special puppies. The first was published several years ago in another Christmas Regency collection under the title ""The Hounds of Heaven"". The other four stories were good reads. Yes, the story about the Russian woman was a bit contrived, but it was fun!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"As previously mentioned by other reviewers, I found the writing of Barbara Metzger and Edith Layton very enjoyable. I didn't like the plots of the stories written by Andrea Pickens or Nancy Butler; however, the most unrealistic/believable story written by Gayle Buck was a complete and total disappointment. Not only did her references to my lady and my lord in conversations between husband and wife sound more like they were speaking to servants, but there were a few mistakes with regard to social etiquette; an example: Lord Hallcroft crosses his legs during a visit with his Aunt in the presence of both his Aunt and his wife. Proper etiquette during that time did not permit a gentleman to cross his legs. Ms. Buck's attempt at being overly formal in the story also did not work for me . . . came across as boring."
3,Agree with Rater below - 3 good stories,"The stories by Barbara Metzger, Edith Layton, and Nancy Butler were all pretty good. I especially liked ""The Dogstar"" (Layton) and ""Christmas with Dora Davenport"" (Butler). I was quite disappointed with Gayle Buck's offering, ""Christmas Cheer."" Based on her status as an author, I would have expected more from Ms. Buck, but the whole premise of this story was unbelievable, and the writing was stilted.I don't know why the earlier Signet regency Christmas anthologies seemed so much better (especially the first 5-7 years). Maybe because Signet now has a 'theme' for each book... perhaps that constricts the writers in some way. Overall, however, this year's ""Christmas Courtship"" book was pretty entertaining."
4,3 great stories-recommended....,"of the five regency Christmas stories, I personally enjoyed Barbara Metzgers, Edith Laytons, and Nancy Butlers. I thought they were all well written and easy to get into. I didn't finish Andrea Pickens or Gayle Bucks stories. The writting style of those two were just to formal and stilted for my taste. I would still highly recommend this wonderful Christmas romance anthology!4 stars!"
5,This book has enhanced family togetherness.,"My wife, my children, ana I have enjoyed reading this book together as the holiday season begins. The story and accompanying illustrations add to the magic of Christmas. My children have continued to request this story every night before bedtime."
5,Beautiful!,The author made it sound so real.It made me beleive again.Its a great book for the whole family(especially those that are young and young at heart!)
4,Still better than other brands,"I've been using vinlyex for a number of years and consider it a very good product. It is not too shiny and leaves vinyl looking good and (apparently) protected.For what it's worth - I was told that some of the products that leave a high shine, oily residue can actually aid the sun's damage. It's been suggested that it has the same effect as basting a roast... i.e. - it just cooks faster."
2,"Okay, but not the best","I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior. I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off, the dash looks very dry.I've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz, and that works much better. It doesn't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues, ie., it doesn't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield, and the shine lasts longer. It also protects from UV just as well, if not better. I'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather."
1,Vinylex protectant,"Vinylex is a great product for use on my classic cars that have vinyl seats. The problem was from the company that sold it to me. First they shipped a bottle of Plastic X,which is not for vinyl but clear plastic,it cost half the price and really is useless to me.So I shipped it back to them at more than six dollars expence to me.They have yet to pay me back.Later I found out that you can order it from Walmart on line and pick it up at your local Walmart."
1,Bottle broke during transportation,"We never got to use the product, as the bottle was broken upon arrival, and we had to throw it out."
3,Disappointed in the product,"I bought this series of products based on the recommendation of a local person I hired to patch my friend's leather car seat. He told me that my chair in the house was not leather and reccommended this product to clean it. I'm glad I tried it in a small obscure spot as recommended, as it took the color out of the spot I tested. My chair is indeed leather I think and this is not the right product. I have tried it on other vinyl products with the same result. Perhaps you will have better luck than I did. I won't be purchasing any more of these products by this brand name. Live and Learn."
5,Very effective,Had a vinyl seat on the verge of cracking from being so dry. Armorall hadn't been doing the job but one application of Vinylex brought the seat back to new. Very impressed.
4,superior vinyl protection product,"I have used Vinylex for treating automotive and boat rubber, plastic, and vinyl surfaces. Vinylex seems to penetrate and provide a more lasting treatment/protection for these materials than other similar products on the market. Vinylex appears to revitalize rubber door and window gaskets, vinyl upholstery, and even our boat bimini, by cleaning and softening the material while providing UV resistance. The only complaint I have is that the trigger sprayer on the bottle occasionally does not last as long as the contents. The spray head on one of the bottles in my recent order was cracked and leaking. This was due to poor shipping packaging and was not a product defect. This is a superior product for rubber and vinyl maintenance."
5,Happy With It!,"First time Vinylex user but I'm not new to Lexol products, having used their leather cleaner / conditioner in the past. First of all, the price seems very reasonable for the 16.9 oz. bottle and I don't have any issue with the spray mechanism feeling cheap. I have a bay boat and used this 4 times now to treat the vinyl. I like the low gloss appearance after drying and I actually do feel like it adds ""conditioning"" to the vinyl as well as UV protection. I don't know how well it does in the way of cleaning vinyl since I've managed to keep mine clean and haven't had the need for that. Overall, this product has met my needs and I plan to continue to use it."
5,A different world of Pokemon!,"I've watched the animated series, I've played the game, I've read the comics but I've never ever seen a comic about Pokemon that is sooo adorable as this! This is what I want! I've been searching for this kind comic. So cute, so funny and so...wonderful! I never thought anyone could make Pikachu any cuter than he is already."
4,Very Tasty Acoustic Blues CD,"I have been a fan of simple acoustic Blues since I first heard recordings by Leadbelly with Sonny Terry. This highly-underappreciated form of Blues has a history as rich as it's electric offspring and it is a shame that there are so very few practioners of this artform. I was delighted to recieve this CD and listening to it has been a joy.Portland, Oregon-based Back Porch Blues does an excellent job of harkening back to their forefathers. Whit Draper on Guitar and Jeffrey Dawkins on Harmonica seem to have made a study of the pioneers of their respective instruments and they do a very nice job on every single cut on this CD. Sheila Wilcoxson has an almost too-fine voice for this style of music, but I really give her credit for allowing her musicians room to do their thing.Overall, it's not a ground-breaking album, but I liked it a lot and definitely enjoy listening to it from time to time."
5,One of the Best,This is one of the blues albums that I keep on playing and playing and playing. Recommended for anyone who enjoys blues.
2,Not very useful,"After I bought it, I have not used them yet. I might use them for emergency pills so that I can keep a box and my wife keep a box for me - not my regular pills."
2,"Too small. They open when they fall, average locking system.","I should have taken in consideration the size of these li'l small pill boxes before buying them. I guess that might be my fault, but they are too damn small as anyway you see it. I take a lot of medication, so this doesn't help.The locking system is just plain average, they close fine, but when they hit the floor, they pop open and all the pills just are just thrown around everywhere on the floor. It also feels it's going to give up fast with time use.Not so good locking. Too small for my taste. I guess the price says it all."
4,"Good, not great. Very simple.","I am not knocking it for it's simplicity. Only saying ghat this is not a pill box. It is a small plastic box that you can store, among many other things, pills in it. I would have liked to see a more secure way of keeping it closed. Overall it works."
1,Poor quality,I purchased these bits in order to switch out some screws on my motorcycle. I used the T45 bit and didn't have any problem removing the screws but putting the new ones in was a different story. I needed to torque the new screws to 21 ft/lbs. the first one wasn't a problem. On the second one the bit twisted to the point where it's unusable before it reached 21 Lbs. Needless to say I'm sending them back and getting another set.
2,One time use...,"I purchased this set for the larger sizes mainly, so that I could remove some foot pegs on a dirt bike. I was able to remove & re-install two bolts, but the T50 is now twisted to the point where it's unusable. It got the job done...once. I may never have to use it again, so the price was right for a one time use product. I would purchase a higher quality set for repeated use."
5,The Best Mountaineering Guide to the High Sierra,"There are just a few really good guides to mountaineering in the High Sierra and this book is the best of those. I've been backpacking the Sierras for 25 years and this book has become my #1 trip planning guide. Secor's detailed descriptions and breadth of knowledge, especially of the mountaineering passes provide indispensable information for anyone undertaking Sierra mountaineering travel."
4,Good Guide,"Easy to read and well organized. Useful for trip planning as well as arm chair hiking and climbing on a rainy day. A little something for everyone, including permit, trail head, trail, and climbing route info with useful photos showing the various routes. It is a bit more of a nuts and bolts (cams and biners??...sorry)guide for the mountain climber rather than a hiking guide. Lots of info on first ascents as well. My only criticism is the maps, which are a bit lacking in detail."
1,Disheartened Climber,"This book contains the least amount of useful information that I've ever seen in a guidebook. It more or less is a historical document of routes that have been done and who did them. A prime example is what is written about Fishhook Arete - ""follow the arete to the summit"". That's it; if I knew where the approach was, what gear to bring, and how long it would take I'd also know to follow the arete. Fortunately I borrowed this book from a friend who also has the same opinion."
1,Surprisingly useless book.,"A lot of maps, pictures and wording. Absolutely no precise information about trailheads, approaches to the picks, trails and routs itself. A failed attempt to tall all about everything."
2,Watch your back!,"It was fun to get hold of this book which was published in the thirties. There is some good information but...at the same time it is written and produced by a government trying to sell the ""elastisity"" of the Constition of the United States, that is, make it bend, squeeze, and stretch to accomodate FDR's desire to socialize the nation during his administration."
1,Yet another horrible release from Madacy,"Count Basie is an American legend. His recordings are legendary, and during his 40+ year career, he made some of the finest recordings in the history of jazz music.And since he's so important, he's got tons of compilations. But 'Golden Legends' stands out, and not in a good way, either. Why, you may ask?Well, it looks really good. It's got most of Basie's standards and some underrated songs. And it's cheap, too. So you may be thinking, ""What's so bad about it?""The sound quality is HORRID! Count Basie is considered an American icon, and he deserves SO MUCH BETTER!!! Why anybody would actually pay $$$ for this is beyond me. Madacy, just like all of their other releases, makes no effort whatsoever to clean this up.Overall, buy 'Greatest Hits (RCA).' Buy 'Ken Burns JAZZ.' Buy 'The Complete Atomic Basie.' Anything else will do. But do not buy this.NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,Ordered for 4 windows only got 2,"Ordered set for 4 windows only got 2 fronts.When I called WeatherTech they more or less saidtoo bad and started a verbal confrontation.I over talked the lady at WeatherTech and informedher I would write a bad review. She said ""so whatwe get a lot of those""???"
5,everybody would benefit,relationships are about education and more education and that is what this book is all about
3,diversion safe,"Well made, looks identical to the real thing, and tried it out; my friends never guessed what it was (thought it was broken or empty). Worth it's weight; I'd buy it again."
2,Not like vanilla extract,"I was disappointed with this powder. I thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract, but it doesn't. When used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed. I won't buy it again. I prefer using vanilla extract."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I was impatient waiting for this book to come out. But it ended up being a big disappointment. Lynn Kurland's best book is This is all I ask. This certainly does not measure up. Gwen was a disappointment. She was forever getting into scrapes and thinking she could save the day, but all she ever did was make things worse. Rhys was interesting, but lacked the charisma of some of Kurland's other heros. Overall, I am glad I read this book because it explains where the de Piagets come into the picture, but otherwise it was a waste of time."
2,Bottom line; pretty bad!,I don't like to speak poorly about an author's work because at their worst they write better than I could even imagine. Another Chance To Dream by Lynn Kurland is just such a book. Gwen the heroine annoyed me from the moment I met her and Rhys the hero is so gallant he appears to be a wet noodle. I thought a book about Rhys' parents would have made a much more interesting story. I enjoyed their small cameo.
3,fairytale,"This author's short story in Tapestry blew me away. So, I go in search for more. This story was somewhat depressing for over half of the book. Liked the characters & LK's writing - but that made it even more dissapointing somehow.Rhys has saved his virginity for Gwen -- a lady above him in station. Finally after one session of loving (which we do not get to read!) no more sex. 0, count them, 0 love scenes.He lives in the castle as her personal guard for 2 years. Gets no sleep from thinking of her! -- so then travels around the country as a knight for hire -- becomes famous for tourney wins ...He struggles to acquire the money to bargain for her and buy land (over 5 years now - he's no sex!) -- We're really not sure, UM, just how the h*ll is he gonna get the lady from her Lord & Husband. YES, she is married and has children with said husband. !!! Noble night. Hopeless romance. No steamy scenes.Done w/ this series."
3,Hello...I don't think so,"I just loved ""Stardust of Yesterday"" so I thought I may enjoy this story as well by Ms Kurland, but I was disappointed. I could have done without Gwen procreating with another man while the man she loves stands right outside her bedchamber. Yuk, I would be beyond mortified. And all this just for a piece of land? This is romance? This is love? Hello...I don't think so.Though I enjoyed all her other books, I wasn't too pleased with this one."
1,DEPRESSING,"Every other Kurland book is a five-star, without a doubt. This is the one glaring exception. The book was depressing. Yeah, yeah, the characters end up together in the end but by then who should care? They've been through so much at that point that you almost rather Kurland kill them off and allow them to be done with their misery.If you like depressing authors like Danielle Steele then you will be in true nirvana with this sad tale. Otherwise, skip this one and wait for Kurland's next one. Her other books are so good that I'm convinced this is going to be a one-time mistake. Hey, nobody's perfect."
1,I have to agree...,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewers who gave this a one or two star rating. This was definately not one of Lynn Kurland's best. I loved her other books, especially ""Stardust of Yesterday"", ""A Dance Through Time"" and ""The Very Thought of You"". Until this book, I had not been disappointed by anything from Lynn Kurland. It is filled with misery rather than the love and humor her other books contained. It was very difficult to get through. I kept hoping it would get better, but was sadly mistaken.Take mine and others advice, don't bother with this particular book, but rather read her previous books - they are very good. I will chalk this one up to a one time mistake, and eagerly look forward to her next books."
2,SHE HAS DONE BETTER.,THE CHARACTERS WERE FLAT THAT EVEN THE HUMOROUS STUFF WAS LOST. IT STARTED OUT GREAT AND THEN AFTER THE MAIN CHARACTERS BECAME LOVERS HE HAD TO SIT OUTSIDE HER DOOR WHILE SHE HAD A WEDDING NIGHT WITH SOMEONE ELSE I WAS FINISHED. I HATED IT AND EVEN THOUGH THE ENDING WAS HALF WAY DECENT I ALREADY HAD LOST INTEREST AND DIDN'T CARE. I HAVE READ ALL HER OTHER BOOKS AND LOVED THEM THIS WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT.
4,Rhys & Gwen are 5 star characters....,"Rhys was a fine hero, and Gwen was a strong lovely woman. Even when things didn't go their way, which was often, Rhys still was perfect. I did find it hard to equate this young pair as the parents of the grown de Piagets' in other novels. Rhys & Gwen seemed much more formal in the other stories. All in all, these are all fabulous characters even if the stories aren't always perfect. Well done."
4,Good humorous characters,"This book contains Lynn Kurland's excellent humor. I love the dialogue she writes and the funny characters she creates (in the twins here), but this book also had a very sad plot line. Much bad befalls the two main characters -- more than someone would like to see in a romance novel. I was depressed through the first 2/3 of the book for the unthinkable things that happened. It picks up after that, though. I have read most of Kurland's books and this is my least favorite. Still, I highly recommend her other books such as Stardust of Yesterday and Dance Through Time."
1,Disappointing.,"I loved Kurland's first three books. However, this one -- bad. Kurland wrote the book as though it were an effort -- the characters were dark and weighted and the story line was creeky, depressing and not at all ""magical""."
3,Too silly and unrealistic even for a romance.,"I couldn't finish this one. The heroine was just silly and immature, and the so-called hero came across as helpless and unsure, with equally immature notions. I lost interest in them both about a third of the way through the book. There are too many really good stories out there to waste my time with mediocrity. I gave it three stars because the writing itself was okay, and Kurland has a good command of language."
1,What a disappointment!,"I expect wonderful stories from Ms. Kurland, but this wasn't one of them. Her other books are terrific, but this is one to miss. The main characters were flat and the events they endure are not what I want in a romance novel (e.g., the hero standing guard outside the bedroom door while the beroine has a painful wedding night with her abusive husband). The ending was surprisingly interesting (I finished the book only through sheer determinism), but I think I would rather she told the story of the hero's parents or grandparents. They were much more interesting."
2,two stars for effort,"I was so disappointed in this last book by Ms kurland. I have read all her other books and adored them. This one starts out very promising and then dies and drags on to a very slow death. The characters are all wishy washy and you can care less what happens, you finish it just to be done. Rys and Gwen fall in love as children then he goes away, she trys to find him before she has to marry someone else. He meets her they confirm there love and then she gifts him her virginity. After that she has to marry someone else and he stands guard while she has sex with her husband and then the book goes down the drain. We want fantasy not dry boring reality. Sorry."
2,Having A Hard Time Finishing This Book,"I'm just at the halfway point of this book and having a very hard time trying to read it. Once again Rhys and Gwen are trying to open their hearts about each other, but,yet again, cannot due out of loyalty and what's right for everybody else. That's good and all, but do you have to drudge it out every 5 to 10 pages? It's nice to know that they both end up together at the end (don't they all?), but getting there is bad. I strongly suggest ""Star of Yesterday""...very good book."
1,0 Stars. 1 Hot mess of a story. 2 Wimpy main charaters.,"Quite simply, one of the worst books I've ever read. Most of the book revolves around the lead female marrying a jerk and having his children. Through years of this, the hero follows her around and acts as her protector while watching her make a family with another man. Each time he tries to convince her to let him attempt an escape for the two of them and the children, she starts balling and refuses. Why the heck did he want to stay? In the end, I suppose they deserved each other. A couple of wet noodles. A man who is celibate, and a woman who ""services"" her jerk husband. Ah... so romantic. NOT!"
4,"This was a great, fun read!","I really dislike reading all of the ""a reader"" reviews on Amazon. Who are these people? This was a great book that I really enjoyed! Great lead & secondary characters the whole way through!This was a fun read that held my attention without all of the graphic sex (that I am getting really tired of)."
2,"great light, almost impossible to change battery","It works great, but to change the battery, you have to open 4 microscopic screws that strip easily. They could have easily made it slide open instead."
5,Every keyring's friend,"Always have a light when you need it--attach it to your keys and you'll appreciate it many times over. Bright, easy to use, solidly made and convenient."
5,"great size, great light","I bought a pair of these to use when a little extra light is needed and they have been great. Perfect size for a keychain, backpack, etc. the light is bright and the option to keep the light on without pressing the button is a great feature."
1,Never worked,"After years of purchases, this is the only thing I've ever ordered from Amazon that didn't work. I suppose 1 out of 100s is a good ratio. Additionally, it looks and feels pretty fragile."
1,Selling fake knock offs.,"Ordered several white, yellow and red lights. The white ones came in OEM packaging and appear to be the real thing. All of the red and yellow units arrived in ziploc bags and are obvious knock offs. No Photon marking on the plastic, look different, keyring is wrong, etc.Seller is CS Discount Imports, LLC. Don't buy from them."
2,1 out of 2 oem = fake,"Bought 2 lights last week. one blue. one green. the green one has a full packaging and all the notes of what a real LRI II light should look and have. the blue came in this little plastic bag. the green came directly from Amazon. the blue from this other seller - Fargos enterprises. Not only was the blue light fake in all of its packaging, the LED light is noticeably weaker than the real green light I have with me to compare.I'm a bit dissapointed receiving fake or OEM product replacements trying to pass on as legit. beware."
1,BEWARE Not an LRI brand light!!!,"Ordered 2 of these from Amazon because they were cheaper than LRI website price. What arrived were NOT LRI brand keychain lights. The package was just a celephane wrapper not the true LRI cardboard package. The light is NOT as bright, and the switch cover is hard plastic not the softer poly on the true LRI! The photo provided shows the real LRI light notice the fine rings on the switch. The light I received has a smooth switch cover. Also the corregated BOX was just some cardboard folded over and apparently one of them came out during shipment that or it was never included! This package also contained items from 2 other auctions. Only recieved ONE of the keychains, but that is OK because I just threw it away as it is useless providing so few lumens. First time I have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase! I read a review before ordering and I did not head his warning that this was not an LRI, hope you don't make the same mistake."
1,Button Got Stuck in the ON POSITION,"i have bought several of these lights and have had TWO of them get stuck in the ON POSITION after only a week or two of use. This effectively ruins the light, as the battery dies out. On a positive note, the battery kept the light illuminated for almost 10 days straight!"
2,NOT a true PHOTON light,"""LRI PWK PHOTON II LED"" it is NOT. No ""PHOTON"" on micro-light, no ridges on microlight as pictured in advertisement. These were cheap knock-offs, so it's FALSE advertisement. The lights work, but they're not true Photon brands. I was going to give them as gifts, but kind of embarrassing. Amazon/seller (listed today as ""Miriam Holdings LLC"") needs to fix this on its advertising to make things true and right"
2,On button too small,"I trusted the great reviews of this but I'm not a fan. The on button is very small and mine won't stay on. I have small hands and still, the tiny button is hard to turn on."
3,LED keychain flashlight,"It does the job, though appears to be a bit flimsy. I will see if it is durable under the conditions of being on my keychain for a while. I am generally satisfied, however."
1,Useless garbage light,Mine worked for about 4 days before the battery gave out. Tried to replace the battery and the cover would no longer attach to the back. What a useless peice of garbage this thing is. Do Not waste your money!
5,Great little flashlight,"This is a nice, basic key chain flash light.It comes with a battery in it that is not activated until you pull the plastic tab. The bulb on this thing is bright for its size. Overall I wish I bought more of these and not the Streamlight 72101 KeyMate which costs more to maintain than to purchase!However, this Photon II LED Keychain Micro-Light deserves all 5 stars."
4,Very effective,Product was actually a little too strong for what I needed but works great. Arrived in time and in excellent condition.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED-DO NOT BUY IT,"The real LRI Photon II LED keychain light is great. Unfortunately, this is not it. It does not have the Photon logo on the case, does not come in the Photon box and is not nearly as bright as the real thing. This is a poor copy and should be removed from the site. The only thing I have ever bought from Amazon that I returned."
1,Another knockoff,"I received a light from Fargo Enterprises, Inc. (dba Micro-Tools). I did not examine it closely other than to make sure it lit. However, on closer comparison with a genuine Photon, I found it did not have the 'micro PHOTON light' molded into the plastic, the thumb switch was not textured, the phillips head screws are different, and the batteries are 'acolyte', an unknown brand. On a side by side comparison, the light output is slightly dimmer and a bluer shade than the real thing."
5,Great and handie light!,Over the years I had more than six of this brand of LED lights and the are very dependable. Takes up very little room on you key ring and yet give lot of light when needed.Will keep buying them.
5,enlightening,This little light is always with me. I have used them for years and find them very useful for shedding light in dark places.
3,Get the Photon Freedom if you like having the ON mode,"Someone recommended me buy a photon key light and I just did. I learned this one and the Freedom are different. I like to have the light on while my hands are free to unlock my back door. It is easy to turn on the permanent light. Hard to turn the permanent light off because the clear plastic tab goes down hard. So I guess, I probably going to get a freedom next time."
3,Not as shown,"Received the LRI PWK Photon II and it works as expected. However, I was disappointed that it did not have the easy clip on ring as shown in the picture but had a standard O type ring instead. It makes a big difference."
5,One of the most useful tools I own,"This is a great little flashlight. Since I have it on my keychain, it's instantly available (no searching for a flashlight). I use it daily. The switch for locking the light on makes this one superior to the ""squeeze only"" version. The light it bright, and the two CR2016 batteries last for months. Changing the batteries is a little bit of a nuisance - you need a very small Phillips screwdriver and the procedure requires careful fiddling, but I change them so infrequently that the annoyance level is pretty low. I still give it five stars. Those less mechanically inclined might skip the battery change and just replace it."
4,A little hard to operate,"I bought this micro-light two years ago and it still works like the day I got it. It doesn't take up much room but, it's a little hard for me to use the switch. I was used to one that had a large easy to find button but, it was ""large"". The light is sufficient but not as bright as I was hoping. I like it just fine though and hope it lasts me forever."
5,Great small momentary light,I've had a Photon II in red for 10 years that I carry everyday with my car keys that still works. I picked up this green one to also save my night vision. I placed this one on my backpack zipper pull. This light is seriously bright for its size.
3,OK for the price,"To be honest, I was expecting a little bit more based on other reviews. The keychain itself is an upgrade from the one pictures, and has a better clasp. I expected the light to be a little brighter, and was disappointed that I have to hold the button down for the light to come on, rather than having a switch. For the money though, it was a good buy."
1,whatch your shipping from certain vendors,I missed the Fine Print were I ordered x6 LRI PWK Photon II LED Keychain Micro-Lights @ 0.35 cents& got Charged $28 Dollars for Shipping. My bad for not paying attention.This is Outrageous.I will never order from Genco Tools again ever Period.watch out for your shipping!!!!!
4,Decent light,"Very handy to have, nice and bright. However, there are many lights like this out there. I own a couple different ones, compared to others they are all about the same as far as brightness. This one is a little pricey. I found others at about half the price, but it's still a good little flashlight, the clip is a good feature or just good to keep in your pocket"
5,Great Little Light,This is a great little pocket flashlight. It is easily attached to a set of keys and stored in the pocket of a pair of trousers. It is very handy and very powerful. The light is bright white and shines at a long distance. This is a great item for women also. It can be attached to a key chain and placed in a purse. It is a wonderful item and I am grateful that I was able to find this product on Amazon.
1,MICRO-TOOLS SELLS FAKE KEYCHAIN LIGHTS,"I bought this thinking that it was a real Photon light, but I ended up getting a fake one.It was used and didn't come in the original packaging and even worse, it was a fake knock-off that you can buy on amazon for less than $1http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014XUUI4/This is the exact same one I received, but at a fraction of the price. If you want a fake knock-off, buy that one instead."
5,Fits the bill,"The push button is easy and intuitive. The sliding on/off switch is less so. I can't remember which way is on, and it requires some force to move it. But that is good because you don't want to turning on by accident and killing the battery. The switch is small and requires a thumb nail to move, but again, that is a good thing.I use this often when leaving my office late at night. I have to fumble with my keys to lock my door and the hall lights are already off (complete darkness). I could use my office light to find the hall switch, turn the light on, lock up, open the door at the other end of the hall for some light from the street, turn off the hall switch, and then leave. But it's so much easier just to use my super bright key chain light. This is where the on switch is a major benefit."
1,FAKE.,"What I received was a counterfeit Photon light. Real Photons are wonderful lights and I have been using them for many years. This is NOT a real Photon. It is a cheap knock-off being sold as a real Photon. Amazon said it was sold and shipped from them. Listed on the receipt is ""Sold by Miriam Holdings LLC."" The ""seller"" info for Miriam takes me to SuperDeal.Amazon customer service said they would refund me if I sent it back and they sent me a return label. The time it would take to pack it up and take it to the post office is worth more than the refund amount, not to mention that the fake light is worthless.REAL LRI Photon IIs are amazing lights. Real Photons come in packaging with warranty, care, and use instructions. Real Photons exude quality and are the best micro-lights on the market in my opinion. What I received is junk.A first time buyer might be fooled and take the bait-and-switch without ever realizing it."
1,FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is not a review this is a warning. These lights sold by PLEXSUPPLY are FAKES! Yes, they work, so you might not even care. But they are not the LRI photon II. They are just cheap knockoffs."
1,"PLEXSUPPLY SELLING FAKES, AMAZON DOESN'T CARE","If you decide to purchase this product, be very, very careful who the seller is. PLEXSUPPLY is just sending out fakes thrown into a ziplock bag and advertising it as a genuine photon light. Amazon has been contacted about this but apparently they don't care about it, so it's up to us to let all you know about this little con-job. Pretty shady if you ask me..."
1,"FAKES!! from vendor ""Super Deal""!!!!!!!!","There are lots of warnings not to buy from ""Plexsupply"" so I thought I was playing it safe by going with ""Super Deal"". Much to my disappointment, the lights I received came in small plastic baggies and were very dim. Junk basically. Obviously not the real deal. I'll replace my order directly with Amazon and hopefully i'll get the right ones."
2,Switch doesn't work,"Received it fast and on time, packaged well. The push button switch works well, but the on/off switch doesn't stay in the on/off position."
5,A Compact High-Intensity Flashlight,"It is surprising how a tiny LED packaged in a small black plastic case can produce such a high-intensity-beam and a wide-angle-coverage light. Forget about carrying a bulky flashlight when you go fishing, camping or any outdoor activities. Take the Micro-Light and put it in your pocket or at home or in your car. The beam characteristic is such that in an experiment where I stood about 6-ft from the wall, it has a much brighter portion at the center with a diameter of about 2-ft, while the actual beam coverage extends to about 15-ft in diameter. So you can see alot in the dark when you turn this mini flashlight on. I like the design, not only because of the intense brightness it produces and the area it covers, but also its ease of use. A feature that users might easily overlook is there is a locking transparent on-off switch to allow you to leave the light on without having to keep pressing a button."
1,Amazon - great....... Product - bad news,"Horrible, horrible.......wouldn't work.....can't get help......can't find a phone number to get help......plus Amazon didn't have a phone number for them......I am glad that I bought it thru Amazon because I was able to return it......Amazon service is GREAT, product BAD"
4,greyhound owner,The costume was as shown and the closures were secure but the sizing chart is not accurate. The x-large size only went two thirds of the way down my greyhound and the fasteners were not long enough for the wide circumference of his chest.
4,cute but a bit hard to see,"Really fast delivery time.....4 days. Cute costume, but really most effective from the rear view. I ordered an extra large for an average size Aussie. Fit great. ""The little stinker""..........."
5,Ya Ya stinker,Just think this is a fabulous idea. My large Anatolian Female Dog is a stinker sometimes.
5,Excellent,This is great software. I love all of the precious babys. It makes me cherish my son all the more. I can't hardly wait until the next month to see the new picture. Anne Geddes has done it again.
5,You will never read the New Testament the same way again!,"Walter Bauer spent five hours every day of his scholarly career working on this invaluable lexicon. This lexicon will open up the world of New Testament Greek to even the beginning scholar. With only a little help and looking through the introduction to the lexicon, this volume will unpack the meaning of all the words in the New Testament and other Early Christian texts. If you are a seminarian, pastor, or interested person, this is a must have volume for your shelves."
4,Chi's & Kappas Look the Same!,"I was not so impressed with this lexicon. It did not give the full meanings of many Biblical words. I was VERY disconcerted by the printing of the letters kappa and chi - they both were the same! Was this a typo by The University of Chicago Press? At any rate, I would still recommend this book as it does seem to cover much of the most important words of the New Testament such as ""predestination,"" ""spirit,"" ""baptism,"" and some others. Though the cost does not match the overall quality of this text, i.e., the cost ($) is way too high.-Dr. Cris Graham"
3,Not the last word,"I wish I could say better things about this tome. It's good for the NT, I suppose, but its claim of coverage of 'early Christian literature' is not. In particular, it is near useless for Origen or Ignatius, containing few of their neologisms or hapax legomena. Basically, I use it to look up words I don't know, and it doesn't have the great bulk of them."
5,Walter Bauer's Wörterbuch - a classic standard,"Though I have not seen the Danker edition I have extensively used Walter Bauer's Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament (Walter De Gruyter, Berlin, 1971; ISBN 3110020734), a quality reference for exegetical research. Bauer's work is not as exhaustive as TDNT, but it is one of the finest works in it's respective field and a must for anyone in the field of philology and hermeneutics. Any updated version can only enhance this lexicon."
5,A Useful Ministry Tool,If you are looking for Lexicon this one is probably the best you'll find on amazon. The Lexicon gives detailed meanings and interpretation of key greek words and some historical background. It does fail to note when certain translations are recent and still controversial as other translations of Bauer's work do (User Beware). This book is useful for anyone who is interested in getting deeper into what the Bible really means. I would also recommend obtaining a book that teaches the basics of Biblical Greek. This will allow you to unlock the full potential of a Lexicon.
2,over-rated and not worth the $,"For much less than the price of this lexicon, one can purchase a copy of Thayer's, AND Trenchard's vocabulary guide AND a Greek concordance. People make a big deal about how Thayer's lexicon is out of date because he did not have access to the papyri, but for 99% of New Testament words and meanings this is not an issue. Trenchard's book is actually MORE helpful, in my opinion, than this or any lexicon because he simply lists every possible meaning of each word. One way to get to the essence of a word's meaning is to look at the cognates, and Trenchard lists them all. A Greek concordance will actually print all the NT uses of a word in Greek. Bauer's lexicon tends to be wordy. It's helpful, don't get me wrong, but way over-priced."
1,Greek!,This is all Greek! How can you learn the Greek meaning if there is no English to explain? This was a gift to our son who loves to study the Bible.
2,Hmm...Not All That Great,"I love the Insyderz, don't get me wrong. I've seen them live twice and I have all of their CDs. But this CD was such a major disappointment for me; I bought their first album, ""Motor City Ska"", when it first came out on Gumshoe Records several years ago. And that album rocked my world for 3 months straight. So of course I enjoyed ""Skaleluia!"", but it wasn't exactly new material. I was so psyched for ""Fight Of My Life"" that I was actually the first person to buy it from the local Christian store! And when I put it in, I liked it...but didn't love it. Songs such as ""The Hunted"" and ""Fight Of My Life"" are chill, but the rest of it just doesn't impress me much. If you want a much better album of the same band, pick up ""Motor City Ska"". 2 stars."
3,An alright follow up,"Now that I listen to the Insyderz knowing they aren't really a ska band at all, it helps me enjoy their music much more- however while this CD has a few good songs on it, it doesn't match up to its first release, Motor City Ska. So get their first album before you get this one, and if your looking for ska, make sure to look somewhere else then the christian view of what it is, they don't quite have it."
4,Nice set,"The fitness DVD is a little basic, the others are not necessarily going to show you anything new and ground breaking, but fun to have around if your partner is not into full on and usually overly graphic for no reason porn. Nice production quality and good looking couples. A good alternative if you want to watch something to spice it up once in a while."
4,Good Book!,"The Visitation was a good read, just a little too long. It had some good parts and interesting ideas. The characters were well introduced. I would recommand it to my Christian friends. I discovered another book called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas. One of the best novels I've read in a long time. I would also recommand this book, but it does have some strong language. I wouldn't let that stop you from reading it, because the moral message and plot are too good to pass up. Plus, the positive out weighs the negitive by far. If you like good against evil stories with some bite and fresh twists, than, 'The Fist of God' is for you. Even the so-called non-believers would dig this book."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"I sat at my computer waiting for Amazon.com to tell me this book had been released. I have read all of Peretti's books and was sure that this one would exceed my expectations. I was wrong. Although the book is interesting enough, it lacks the drama, symbolism, and spirituality of the others, especially The Oath. I love Frank Peretti for his heart and for his contributions to Christian literature, but this book left a lot to be desired for me. Of course, it is still a must read for all die-hard Peretti fans."
3,Not a bad story but about 200 page too long!,"Perhpas I should not venure too far from my cops and heroes books, but ""The Visitation"" seemed a challenge. I did not take me too long to guess the eventual outcome. I was glad to see that this author did not attempt to stage religious wars, or make this a theological treatise. Travis Jordan is an enjoyable character, but 519 pages could easily have been condensed to about 300, and which would have necessarily tightened the plot."
3,The Visitation,"This book is worth reading because few Christian writers deal with these important subjects in this manner. However, this book has quite a slow start, then races to a somewhat underdeveloped ending. The plotting is good, but while the writing is adequate, it is nothing special. I wish the caliber of the writing in much of Christian fiction was higher and met the caliber of the subject matter."
3,This book was awesome.,The Vistation was a very good book.It made you think about what happens next and then WHAM you find out something weird about sightings and a cring crucifix on the wall of the church.I am not going to tell you the ending.You will have to read the book to find out.
4,Rising to the peretti Challenge,"Peretti has done it aqain with his latest outing. He constantly entertains while, at the same time, throws out a challenge. As a minister I find his work invites me to assk myself the hard questions: ""what would I do in this situation?"" ""How would I respond to the events around me?"" His insight into pastoral burnout while also dealing with spiritual matters adds a dose of realism and this book is worth reading for the sub-themes eg. the restoration (redemption?)of a burned out small time pastor. I don't alsway agree with Peretti, but I do enjoy his writing and the challenges it throws out to me: it offers me something like a spiritual and ministerial health check. Well done again!"
5,"Thought-provoking, esp. for those who grew up in the church.","The story is captivating and keeps the reader till the very end. I think every Christian who has grown up in the church, or been in Christian circles for a length of time, can relate to the ""religious"" activities, descriptions and characters of the book. Sometimes I found it humerous, other times I found myself thinking very somber thoughts about how I may have or could have been caught up in religious hype and how easy it can be to be deceived. I have read all of Peretti's books. Even though ""The Visitation"" doesn't have the drama of ""The Oath,"" it does get right down to where people live, and that, in my opinion, makes this book real."
5,Super!,"I just finished this book and could not put it down! Thanks Frank, for yet another great story! I do pray that no one ever does what Elder Cantwell did to his son,Justin! I can't wait to start another Peretti book!"
1,The Visitation,I was very disappointed in this book as it was so well advertised. I was expecting an appearance from Christ as that is what the book jacket implied and it did not happen. It really is just about a former clergyman's journey to regain his faith and a man who allowed people to believe he was Jesus for his own self betterment. I do not recommend it and would spend my money elsewhere.
2,Stephen King Lite,"Author Frank Peretti opens up with a great premise---What if Jesus came back and appeared in a small town in Oregon?Unfortuantely, he abandons that promise shortly after the 100-pages mark, and the Sadduces in the local town church council become two dimensional charicatures as Peretti labours to present a Christianly acceptable horror story. How the church would react to an actual Second Coming is a fascinating topic, alas, *The Visitation* choses to go down the false prophet path, and the result is a pale imitation of King's *Needful Things.*"
3,The are better books on this subject,"If you're reading this novel strictly to underscore your faith, then disregard this review--I'm more concerned with the quality of the story, the plot, the writing--which I found less than enthralling. If you're reading this novel for entertainment, then let me direct you to any number of better Last Day novels, including the best of the lot, which goes by the definitive name, THE LAST DAY. Written by Glen Kleier, LAST DAY is probably the best novel ever written in this genre. Stephen King's THE STAND, while not as spiritual and compelling as LAST DAY, is still an exciting, suspenseful read. Both are far more interesting and thrilling than VISITATION. If you liked VISITATION, try reading STAND or LAST DAY for a more heart-pounding experience."
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,This book was not what I had come to expect from Frank Peretti. It's message was confusing and the anti-hero was a little hard to swallow.
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"AFTER HAVING READ ""THIS PRESENT DARKNESS,"" ""PIERCING THE DARKNESS,"" ""THE PROPHET,"" AND ""THE OATH"" WHICH IN MY OPINION WERE POWERFUL, EXCELLENT BOOKS, I WAS SORELY DISAPPOINTED IN ""THE VISITATION."" WE WAITED HOW LONG FOR THIS ONE? TOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT. THIS STORY COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD IN FEWER PAGERS. BUT GOD BLESS PERETTI'S EFFORT."
3,Not Peretti's best work,"I have always enjoyed reading Frank Peretti's books and have had a hard time putting them down. This book was different. It does not grip you and put you into the story as his other books have. It is an interesting story about false christ's, and although interesting, definately not his best work. I look forward to his next work."
4,Have you seen Jesus lately?,"If you have ever been drawn to supernatural sightings, Jesus, Mary, UFOs, or Elvis then this is a must read. It is frightening that people can be caught up as they are in this novel. However this reflects true life more than we imagine. Learn to test the spirits.Ray Ruppert, Author of ""The Sovereign Reigns, or Does He?"" ""The Sovereign's Last Battle"" and ""Revelation: A Layperson's Reflections"""
3,More a commentary on church life than a true thriller,"Peretti is the unquestioned master of Christian fiction -- the John Grisham of the genre. But, like many Christian authors, he seems to have trouble understanding how the real world works -- how real, non-christian people would react to the amazing sights and signs in this small-town setting. He is at his best when describing the inner turmoil of the protaganist. The book also shines in its descriptions of problems in the contemporary -- particularly pentecostal -- church. In fact, the book is better read as a cautionary tale about the modern church and modern christians than as a truly credible supernatural thriller. I'm still waiting for the Christian author who can write believable non-Christian characters . . ."
3,"Worth reading, but kind of soap opera-ish","The Visitation was the first Peretti book I've ever read. I got into the Christian Fiction after reading through the Left Behind Series. It was an ok book worth reading but, something about it at the end left you wanting more. It was written in a sort of confusing manor, and the twists, turns, and revalations left me with a feeling as though I was reading a soap opera."
1,The Visitation is not up to usual Frank Peretti style,"I was disappointed in the Vistation. It was not up the the same line as ""This Present Darkness"", ""Piercing The Darkness"" and ""The Oath"". It does not have the spiritual side in it like those do. I would not give this to anyone that was a fan of Frank Peretti it was a disappointing book.Thank you Lynn Davis"
5,A genuinely Christian thriller,"""The Visitation"" is an unlikely and astonishing piece of fiction: it is nothing less than a genuinely Christian thriller. It is genuinely Christian in that the author knows the Christian life in all its spectacle and subtlety, its ups and downs; it is genuinely a thriller in that it doesn't spare the shocks, the horrors, and the suspense that comprise the genre. I've had difficulty with some of Peretti's work in the past, but ""The Visitation"" is the best Christian fiction I've read since C.S. Lewis. It is also very, very funny. I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,Thank You Mr. Peretti!,"About half way through the book (finished in 1.5 days), I asked myself if this was Frank Peretti's life story. The testimonies towards the end of the novel had me in tears. Truthfully, the ""anti-christ"" story-line didn't do much for me. It was the ""biographical"" story that made me unable to put the book down! Frank Peretti truly understands how religious people can taint the Truth."
4,Great character development! I couldn't put it down.,"Frank Peretti is a master writer who really knows how to spin a tale. This most recent book, THE VISITATION, is Peretti at his best. Readers who are looking for another PIERCING THE DARKNESS will be disappointed, as this book does not get as deeply into the spiritual warfare aspect as some of his previous works. THE VISITATION, however, does the best job yet in developing the main character using both current circumstances and past events to weave a cleverly written tale. THE VISITATION is a story of Christ's redemptive power in the face of man's attempts to twist the Gospel. THE VISITATION is a great read."
4,The Visitation,"When I sat down to read this book, I was anticipating a wonderfull thriller. And to be frank I was disapointed to find that this was not at all like Peretti's earlier books (including The Oath), but instead a much calmer piece of fiction. I enjoyed the book very much, but it just wasn't what I expected from this author. I would highly recommend buying this book, but be cautioned- if you know the author you'll be surprised by his sudden chage in direction. I expected more of Peretti, but this is still a wonderful book by any standards."
5,Cover to cover in three hours...now THAT's a good book!,"I just could not put this book down! From the first page, I was totally into the plot. I found myself laughing at the realistic way Peretti portrays legalism in the church. I found myself crying, reading about the narrator's past experiences. I found myself biting my nails at the climax, and relaxing at the well-written resolution. I have read all of Peretti's earlier works, and The Visitation is definitely the best one, in my opinion."
5,Couldn't put it down...,"I purchased this book one day after being blindsided over something happening at the church I attend. Frank Peretti is so on target with his observations about contemporary American Christian culture. He uses the main character, Travis (and his observations about the churches in town and those in Travis' background) to illuminate much of where we as Christians have strayed into ""programs"" and ""putting on a show"" and clinging to ""the way things have always been done,"" allowing such things to take priority over our own personal relationship with Christ and the core relational action of making disciples. Catholics, Pentecostals, ""mainline"" Protestand denominations, mega-churches and fundamentalists all are all included in this hard look at the state of American Christianity. It is Travis' journey from disilousionment with the institution of the church to a revitalized relationship with God that is the core theme of this book."
3,"""Needful Things"", Christian-style","I was really looking forward to this book; I read a couple of chapters on a Christian bookstore site and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.But I admit to being disappointed -- not so much with the journey back to faith on the part of the narrator (the only thing about the book that kept me reading it) -- but with the plot, which felt like a Christianized version of the Stephen King book ""Needful Things"", wherein a demonically-driven (or flat out demonic) entity comes into town and gives people what they think they want, only to have that thing turn out to be a curse. (Sound familiar?)I'm more likely to go back to ""Piercing the Darkness"" and ""This Present Darkness"" or ""Prophet"" than ""The Visitation""."
3,"Good, but not great","""The Visitation"" is better than ""The Oath"" and much better than ""The Prophet"" (then again, what wouldn't be), but it still runs a distant 2nd to ""This Present Darkness"".The story is definitely a page-turner, and should give one reason to reflect on the role that ""works"" play in one's faith.However, the book seems to fall flat as it works towards its climax. The ""villian"" of the story, and the story behind his particular brand of evil, really doesn't get fully fleshed out. It's a slow build, and then a sudden and convenient finish to the story.Peretti is still a phenomenal author, and this is a good book, but don't expect another ""This Present Darkness"" when you read it"
3,"Not bad, but not stellar either.","I've enjoyed all of Peretti's books, and they're all worthwhile reads. This one is quite a bit more introspective than his others; having portions written from a first-person point of view lends itself to better character development of that particular character, at any rate. But other characters seem to lack development, and flipping between first and third person points of view gives the book a slightly schizophrenic quality. Ultimately the book succeeds more as a critique of the church and organized Christianity and less as a spiritual suspense thriller. Moving in parts, somewhat scary in others, but all in all a mixed bag."
3,Interesting and thought-provoking book,"Having read all of Peretti's books and eagerly awaiting each one as it comes out, I enjoy the different subjects that he tackles with each book. The Visitation is not my favorite or, in my opinion, the best of his books, but it does a good job portraying religious fanaticism and excesses. So many things are done ""in the name of Jesus"" that have nothing at all to do with Him. It reminds us to stay in the Word to avoid being easily taken in. As the Word reminds us that some will have ""itching ears"" running back and forth to this prophet and that, The Visitation is a vivid illustration of that very phenomenon."
5,The Secret to the Thriller....,"The Visitation gets another thumbs up from me. The way that Peretti puts you in the pastor's shoes makes you be a part of the book too, almost like you've been there and done that. I am certainly not saying that I feel like a pastor now, because they work very hard to be what they are, but I do know the book has offered me new outlooks on how they feel. In reading Peretti's books I have noticed the one thing that makes the difficult to read, and that is you must have patience. I have talked to more than one person who started reading the book but quit because it didn't take off like they wanted it too. I promise that if you read through the places in the book that aren't so thrilling, they will give you insight when you get to the thrilling parts, and you won't put the book down until you're done. In my opinion, Peretti has written another great novel that has shown me a different insight on what God has given me. Thanks Mr. Peretti....."
1,Didn't like the tone of this one....,I have read some Peretti books I really liked but unfortunately this was not one of them. The tone seemed very darkand went places I didn't care to go if that makes any sense. Basically I just didn't like the content or themes explored in this book.
1,Eagerly awaited and monumentally disappointed,"Having devoured ""This Present Darkness"", I eagerly awaited Perretti's next book. ""The Oath"" was disppointing but ""The Visitation"" is monumentally disappointing. In my opinion, nothing more than an effort to profit in the marketplace. There is nothing interesting or redeeming about this book --- not to mention that the prose is kindergarden level."
1,Not suitable for people with sensitive spirits,"I read the whole book in 3 days and stylistically it was very good. But when I finished I realized that I felt fear inside because there was no scene where demons expressed terror of the name of Jesus like in previous books that Frank Peretti has written(which ARE uplifting). These demons were described as powerful and angry. My mind has been troubled with some of the grotesque scenes that reminded me more of Stephen King books I used to read before I was saved. I have personally had encounters with the power of the name of Jesus against demons, and I KNOW that they are TERRIFIED of the wrath of the Lamb. This book seemed to emphasize all the destruction that the devil does without the restorative power of God. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T READ THIS PARTICULAR BOOK (read ""The Oath"" or ""This Present Darkness"")"
