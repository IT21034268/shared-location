3,Simply Knittng,"The Simply Knitting Magazine was bought as a gift for Alice. I know she waits for it to arrive every month. I have never read it, the reason for my to give it only three stars is every year when I renew the subscription there is a problem. This year the renewal, as always, was timely but Alice has not received the last three issues. Amazon Magazine Subscriptions is working on it."
5,Outstanding product,"I have used this excellent product on several occasions. The the original finish on the interior of my aluminum fishing boat was all but completely worn off. I applied Skid-no-more to the aluminum sides, wooden seat tops, and bulkheads. The finish was non reflective, is still intact after 12 years and made a new boat out of it. I finished the inside of my truck bed in 1997 adding an Evercoat color tint, and it is still holding up and cool in the sun for the dog, too. My father-in-law used it to refinish his fiberglass boat floor adding an Evercoat color tint. That was two years ago and it looks like new.I have used this to coat the handles of garden tools, workbench tops and more.I wish I had invented it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This stuff is greyish and has to have colorant added. One ounce of white colorant won't properly color even one fourth of a quart. I poured a fourth of the paint into a tin can, stirred in the ounce of colorant, and it still wasn't white. Put it on the diving board, a big mess. Waste of money. The only good thing that you can say is that it has a rough surface. I'm going to have to clean it off and buy a diving board repaint kit."
4,Great album,"I remember my parents playing this album every night before dinner when my Dad got home. It sounds just as great now to me. Such a beautiful and powerful voice! I saw Eydie and her husband Steve in Las Vegas and the show was terrific...she did a lot of these songs then. If you're a fan, you will love this CD."
3,wonderful!,"Eydie Gorme is the original queen of the ""torch song."" Forget Barbara Streisand (who is also great)--this is the real thing!"
5,Amazing So Many Years Later ...,"I can't add anything more informative than what's already been said. After reading these rave reviews, I really wanted the album. It is unavailable from amazon, but I was able to get a copy from Steve and Eydie's website! In case you want it right now."
3,So so,"It was pretty good as far as telling a story in time. Some of the moments are a real blast, but at the same time it has it's dull spots. Could have used some more older footage with a longer intro to the roots of it all."
4,"Excellent, but pictures misleading","The watch looks amazing in real life and keeps accurate time. Two things detract from it though :-The strap is rubbish. I dont know if i just got a defective one, but mine was ROCK HARD and wouldnt bend to fit my wrist at all. It also looked AND felt like cheap, glossy plastic. I had to replace the strap to wear it.-The pictures are misleading, the watch is not pinkish in real life."
4,modeltrain information,great information source. I refer to this book often. It has proven to be a wealth of information. My only fault with this book is the dated pictures and print.
4,Michael Kelly Acoustic Bass Hardshell Case,the case its self was a good onethis seller shiped it to me in about 5 daysit was a little bent and very dustyall and all a good case...with some wiggle room for the bass
5,Ghosts and the American Civil War,"When you think of the American Civil War many things pop into your mind. Trains, trenches, slavery and ghosts. Ghosts roam the landscape of the battle fields like fish roam the oceans. Of course, on such battle fields like those found in Manassas, Petersburg and Gettysburg, you will very likely run into a soldier who refuses to stay down, even after death.Many of the chapters, like the one on Chatham, deal with a ghost who died before the Civil War. But Chatham was used as the HQs for the Union during the first Battle of Fredericksburg. Therefore, it was a Haunted Place of the Civil War.Half the book seems to focus on Washington, DC, where you can't swing a cat without hitting a ghost. Daniel Sickles, Mary Surratt and William H. Seward are said to all roam the streets of the Capital.From John Brown to Abraham Lincoln there are tons of ghosts, from before, during, and after War that roam our streets. Try not to stare."
2,"brief, not much ""how to""","The video is very brief. It gives good reasons for potty training earlier and some basic techniques, but it wasn't what I expected. The ""how-to"" are very short. Of all the ""early"" potty training resources I've looked at the ""Baby Signs Potty Training Kit"" is the best. It has most of the info. in this video in book format and gives very detailed instructions for potty training."
2,Unclear,"I was never quite sure what he was saying, so I read less than half the book. It is not that the writing is bad, just too short. On reading a description of the Viterbi algorithm, I had a eureka moment. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the algorithm I'm thinking of is the one Viterbi proposed."
5,JAG Season 5 --- Outstanding!,This is a continuation of the fine production of this great series. Video and Sound Quality is the best. It's reallly great to see the shows without the commercials. The GAG Reel on this set is pretty cool.
4,Improves as it progresses,"The first season lacked a bit, but it has definitely improved with time. The characters are great. Enjoy the relationships. One of the things I like best about this serious is that it portrays the military in a favorable light...as the heroes that they are. It is refreshing. Some of the dialogue is a little cheesy and the plots a little predictable, but overall very enjoyable."
5,Season 5- For JAG junkies!!!,This is a great continuation of JAG. Bought it for my daughter who loves JAG.
3,In serious need of editing.,"This book covers a lot of information (although it often just skims over info and makes some very obvious, non-thorough analytical points)...but yeah there are many places where the reader is thrown off by awkwardly-worded sentences, and there are also a few typos. Being a college student, I've puchased tons of textbooks in the past two years, and I have found that books written by just one person tend to be the most sloppy all around- perhaps because when you are the sole individual working on a project (be it a book or anything else), you kind of have tunnel vision and are less open to criticism."
3,Adolescence by Santrock,Comprehensive (almost to a fault) content.Very little attention to students with disabilities and impact on development.
2,Unhappy,"I ordered this book from Amazon on Jan 12th, it is now Feb 20th and I have to reorder this book from another vendor to get it before my exam.My order was delayed in shipping twice with no explanation eventhough its supposedly in stock!"
2,A very short film,"Much hyped is the 'over two hours of extras' to make up the short-fall of a very short, slightly amusing mockumentary about graphic artist John Bolton.Trailers of other films don't, to me, count as 'extras', and there's quite a lot of information on other films; about 40 of them (some with trailers, some with just the synopsis).If you are hankering for this kind of 'extra', then by all means, buy this DVD"
1,Expensive looking but poorly designed,"I first tried Zadro's model no. 275. Right after the short warranty ended most of the clocks segments stopped working, then one of the two LED lights quit. Also, the shaver holder never did hold my Gillette Fusion razor properly. Then I tried the more expensive #250. Right away I wasn't able to turn off the LEDs. I left it on expecting it to turn off later and it never did. Later I found the battery compartment was full of water. Like the #275 it wasn't able to hold my razor. Don't waste your money with Zadro's products."
1,This product is completely useless,"Super idea for a shower mirror, really. Zoom, lights that go on when you pull the razor out, clock in the front so you know if you are late, big mirror... what else do you want? I wanted a mirror that wouldnt fog, lights that work, a method of sticking it reliably to the wall, and a properly sealed battery compartment for a SHOWER device. This is NOT what you get in the box. The tape and suction cups don't work, alone or in concert, even on a solid glass shower door. The battery compartment rusted after 2 showers. The lights stopped working the first time it fell 5 feet to the shower floor when the suction cups failed, and the clock quit the next day. The day after that, the lights came back on, during the day sometime, with the razors IN the holes. This is a turd in the punchbowl. Save yourself the trouble and get this instead, it rocks.Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall."
1,Two Zadro Failures,"This was our second Zadro lighted fog-free shower mirror. Unlike most of the others, the light does not go off automatically -- a problem for us. In fewer than 90 days the light, once on, could not be turned off using the switch. The switch in the razor holder still would turn it off but we were not using that. In addition this mirror is clunky. It's obviously meant to stand on a flat surface. It looks ugly in the shower. Since our first Zadro failed in less than a year because the suction cups no longer held it, we had concerns with this much heavier, not really shower-friendly model. We like fog-free, lighted shower mirrors but will look for a different style and brand."
2,Disappointing,"While the mirror works as advertised, be aware that it is listed as stainless steel. It's not stainless steel, it's plastic with a stainless finish!"
1,No chance to test Fogless Mirror!,"I ordered my mirror from Hammacher Schlemmer and it arrived yesterday.After inserting 3 AA batteries, per directions, I attached it to my ""completely dry"" stone shower wall. Thinking, ""Just in case..,"" I placed two towels below the mirror.Early this morning I heard a ""Thump"" and immediately realized what it was. Sure enough, my mirror had fallen off of the wall before I had a chance to try it out!""I suspect the four suction cups might (maybe not) work on granite or corian but they held about 9 hours on my shower wall!"
1,Zadro products are not worth buying.,"I have tried many Zadro mirrors, they are not fogless, or ""Zfogless"" as they claim, the mirrors tend to get corroded around the edges over time, and if they take batteries for clocks or lights or whatever, water gets inside and that's all for those features folks. The very first time I went to change batteries, I found rust and corrosion. I called the company and they said they'd replace it with the receipt but it was past the (lousy) warranty period. Slow to learn I guess, as in-store selection of shower mirrors is limited. No more Zadro mirrors for me though, that is for sure."
1,"Not water tight, basicly useless","What can I say that hasn't been already?The battery compartment is not water tight and I started having issues about one month after buying it, then within 3 months it had died completely. The light never worked well, I bought it for the clock, which stopped keeping accurate time and even displaying whole numbers on the LCD. Now about a year later the mirror fogs up so badly you can't even wipe it off well enough to use it. It has rendered itself a lump of junk plastic suction cupped to my shower wall. I have no idea why I have not tossed it yet. Maybe because of how much I payed?One star for being cheap crap."
1,Don't waste your money on this Mirror.,The battery compartment is not water proof so in about two weeks the lights and mirror zoom stopped working. In about three weeks the battery acid started dripping out of the bottom. I ended up throwing the monstrosity away. Keep your money. Ken in TN.
4,nice book!,An honest book with good tips but then it is not doable for everybody. Who can travel as a courier with a family. It is a very good book if you are single with unlimited vacation!we are going to try to stay with locals which is definitely more rewarding than staying in an isolated grand-chain-hotel!
4,Not for the typical traveler,"Almost 500 pages of mostly unconventional methods for securing free or nearly free travel. Topics include home exchange, house and boat sitting, tour hosting, auto driveaway, hitchhiking, bicycling, volunteering, working, scholarships and awards, travel careers, and much more. Excellent section on free travel resources. Air strategies are frequent flyer benefits, bumping, contests, and asking (and perhaps find a private pilot that will let you hitch). Highly recommended.Reviewed October 2001 by Charles McCool on LowerAirfares.com"
3,Some useful Tips,I found quite a few useful tips on how to travel at a discount and in some cases free or nearly free.
3,It is what it is.,"I bought this knowing completely what it was. It provides exactly what it says. Its emotional, difficult to digest at times, but it is what it is. History. The End of Dana Plato.Some of the comments in here are pretty funny. He should be executed? Yeah, theres some moral high ground. Get a life. or a death."
1,Tabloid Trash!,"This is the most vile & disgusting piece of garbage I've ever seen.Shane Bugbee should be executed for this slanderous tribute to her. Dana was beautiful,how could he say what he did in here. This belongs in the INCINERATOR!"
5,"Great info, Great fun","This book is great for the beginner or the expert. Lots of weekend projects, food for thought, and more power! I find myself reading it of an evening just for ideas; and yes, there are 1001. Entertaining, and produces results in my engine."
1,Almost worthless,"Oh puhlease! This book has no table of contents, and no index. You would be better off just browsing the internet (which, apparently, is what the author of this book has done).I want my money back.- Mike Mallory"
5,"Well Written, Good Recipes and Rich Memories!","This book is a must if you love good Italian food and are fond of warm family memories. It is rich in nostalgia and easy to follow recipes. I am of Italian heritage and grew up in Brooklyn. Reading this book brought back memories of my old Italian neighborhood and the wonderful family gatherings, holidays, and good Italian specialty stores growing up in the 40's & 50's. We tried the Chicken with Mushrooms and Wine and made extra for leftovers, but wound up eating it all in one meal. Many thanks to the author!Virginia Costanzo Reilly"
4,Deserves an international release,"'Chase the Sun' was a huge hit all over Europe a couple of years ago and when PF followed it up with the brilliant 'Inside All the People' (one of the best pop songs of 2001, with great vocals by Dan Black and an iconic video) I was really looking forward to the release of this album. Big disappointment therefore that it hasn't had a US or UK release. (Another case of record company chickenism...)Having finally got hold of it I can confirm it's worth the few extra import dollars. If you like Chase the Sun, you've got more of Sally Doherty's vocals on tracks like 'Under the Rain' as well as some very danceable electro on 'The Switch', 'Tightrope Artist', 'Who Said' and the track they did for Simple Minds, 'Where is the Max'.I've been mean and given it 4 stars but it's the most listened to of my recent CD purchases so go buy..."
4,Amazing!,"I bought this CD when i was abroad in italy this past summer. It's one of the best selling albums there! This is a must buy because there is a great mixture of slow trancy songs and upbeat more techno songs. The singers have great voices, and this CD is great from finish to end. Highly reccommended"
3,OKAY,After fumbling around finally got done what I need to. Books a little rough when searching for what I wanted
2,Not As Detailed As I Hoped,"I bought this bookGeneral Motors A-Cars 1982 thru 1996 Automotive Repair Manualto help a friend who was fixing my car. We needed diagrams of the interior driver's door, showing how the locks work and where the rods are attached, etc. There are no diagrams for this, and just a couple of small b&w; photos that are not helpful. For a book on a specific type of car, this really comes up short. Another friend was looking for the proper sequence for the spark plug wires, and this book wasn't much help there either. Now I am told I should have bought a Chilton manual, instead."
4,Chilton's?,The service was prompt and the condition of the book was as I expected. However I thought I was getting a Chilton's manual and got something called a Haynes Manual. I guess this will work as well.
4,Selected passages from Origen's work...in Greek!,"The book itself is great, but the text is only greek, no english translation, but here is a good one online.http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/origen_philocalia_02_text.htm"
2,Kolpin Gun Sight Vise,"This seller is amazing. Received this order the day I after I ordered it, and the product was as pictured and the price was right for the product I received. However, having said that, this vise is not worth buying, it is made far too flimsy. No fault of the seller at all, I bought cheap so the blame lies with me, not the seller. I WOULD buy from this seller again in spite of this one poor product because their delivery was so stellar!"
4,Excellent DVD/ Not very good CD,I really enjoyed the DVD Listening to Carole King & James Taylor talk about performing at the Troubadour in the 1970's was very informative and enjoyable for me. The best part of the DVD came at the end when James Taylor & Carole King sat down together and talked about thier struggles they went through in thier early careers.The CD is not what I thought it would be.Jeff
3,nice trip down memory lane,It's a nice trip down memory lane to the late 60's and early 70's. Great interviews with all the troubadours and good music. Wish they would let them finish some songs rather than just showing the clips. Of course then it would be a three hour production!
4,Very Efficient,Very expensive; I finally replaced this with a re cleanable filter. The unit still functions very well.That's enough words.
5,Exactly what I needed,"The filter is exactly what my air cleaner requires. I was happy to be able to still get one. I have had the air cleaner for a few years, and it requires a new Hepa filter every year. This is the model # that is needed."
4,Would Buy Again,"This filter did not have the sturdy plastic frame that the original filter did, but if it's replaced every year then it's probably OK. Otherwise it fit well and was an easy replacement. Delivery time was fast and transaction went smooth."
1,Not a whirlpool filter,"Seriously? An original Whirlpool filter? This is an aftermarket filter - it even says so on the packaging. Completely misleading, what they're selling is a cardboard knock off, and I guess hoping you won't notice. I've gotten a lot of things from Amazon, and this is the first thing I'm ever returning, and the first thing I'll probably need to file a claim for to get my shipping charges back. It's a scam!"
3,Misleading,I was lead to believe I was buying a ORIGINAL WHIRLPOOL 1183054 FILTER but what I received was a similar filter with no Whirlbool box or Whirlpool markings or Whirlpool part number on the filter. Filter shipped has a Part number of RFF05503 has no other information on it and the filter itself was packaged only in a clear plastic bag with no product documentation. Makes you wonder where it was made and if is a true HEPA filter. Was I ripped off?
4,Good filter. A bit pricey.,"It's a decent filter. If you bought the HEPA unit itself, you're probably aiming for good air quality. I've had this unit for 2 years now. I have very bad seasonal allergies, and this unit helped me a good bit. Make sure you consider the square footage of the area you're filtering. On the downside, you need to shell out 70-80 every year on a HEPA filter."
3,Bait and switch,These are not real Whirlpool filters. They are clearly NOT Whirlpool OEM product but rather they are cheap aftermarket Filters with no indication who actually manufactured them.Whirlpool originals are of much higher build quality with plastic rims and the HEPA filter paper itself is of much higher quality than these very cheap knock offs (built with cardboard & cheaper paper). If you could compare them side by side its night and day in quality.The filters they sent also have a very odd chemical smell which is unpleasant.I decided not to even use them they were that cheap.UPDATE:Seller sent out replacements after my complaint. Ammending rating to 3 stars.
4,"Quiet, capable machine with one flaw.","It's a great machine, very quiet and planes very well. Adjustment mechanisms are easy to use and the bed surface is as flat as glass... very nice. Easy assembly with minimal clean up and adjustment required as others have stated.I'd have to disagree about the cheap plastic insert just to the left of the blade. It's just bad design and impossible to get flush with the otherwise perfect fence. Wood (especially shorter lengths) can easily jam on it, which is not a safe thing. There is no reason to have it where it is. They could have easily had a fully flush fence and mounted this plastic slider underneath to the rear as there is plenty of space for it. This is only a problem for material less than one inch high, but still a major screw-up by JET.They could have also made the Off switch a little more sensitive so that a hard push is not required.All in all a nice addition to my workshop and so much quieter than my thicknesser."
4,Good machine,I'm not an experienced person with jointers but I think I will like the machine once I've become familar with it. I put it together by myself--with the aid of a chain hoist. Would recommend two people. The manual does not do a great job of explaining how to operate --and adjust the infeed or outfeed tables. I think a mobile base is a must for any shop without an abundance of room. The machine is top heavy so don't skimp on the dimensions of the base. Follow the book on set up. Set it up right and it will do a great job. Don't hesitate to call the company and ask questions. Some of the gibs--outfeed esp.--are ackward to reach.
1,"Good jointer, but hope it arrives without problems","I am rating this as one star, not because of the quality of the jointer, but because of the terrible customer service. When researching what jointer to buy, all I read was how great other companies customer service was. I figured I was safe going with a well known brand like Jet. Well, once I purchased this jointer, I was not necessarily dismayed that a few pieces were damaged beyond repair - they were simple pieces not totaling more than $25.00 to replace.However after having been passed by their customer service from service center, to retailer, and back to service center, I decided to just buy the parts myself. I have never contacted a group of people more eager to pass me off to someone else. If you do decide to purchase this brand, I just hope it arrives without issues."
4,Great tool,This puppy came out of the box easy and set up was possible by myself. When I ran some 100 year old black oak the texture was smooth as glass and I felt no vibration like I did with my old $250 jointer. Not 5 stars cause I really wanted the helix head and the price went down considerably right after I bought it after waiting three months for the price to come down.
3,Well...,The watch itself was delivered in perfect condition. The problem that occured is that quartz mechanism stops every day aprox near 10 p.m. - the marker goes one sec forward and one sec backward (and this happens in loop). This is the only SMALL problem of this watch so far...UPDATE FROM YESTERDAY: I went to the horologer in order to change the battery. He opened watch - I asked him to check what kind of mechanism it is. Unfortunatelly it was not swiss-quartz as it was mentioned in watch's specification. He described it as chineese movement.We both thought that problems with switching the date were caused with weak battery - but watch stopped yesterday again after failing with changing day. I am very disapointed with the mechanism...
1,Watch dead after a year..,"Bought watch a little more than a year ago, it started losing time last week and then stopped, I thought battery must be dead, but as it turns out watch is dead. Not sure if I can get it fixed, but now I realize would have been happier with 30 dollar Timex."
2,Bad Warantee,"Be aware that Stuhrling watches have unfavorable warantee terms. You pay to send it back and have to include $20 for the repair and return shipping, so every time it needs service, you will be out $25 or so. My guess is that this covers the cost of a new movement and shipping so it isn't really a warantee at all."
1,piece of crap,"Bought three of these, gifts , etc, Only one actually keeps time. The others lose time and date constantly. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Better to guess time by the sun"
2,Poor Quality,I purchased this watch hoping it was a good value for the price and was terribly dissapointed. The watch would stop running once or twice a day and when it did run it did not keep good time but lost 5-10 minutes every 12 hours or so. With today's technology that is inexcusable.
1,reliability,"bought 2 sturhling watches, within 2 years, had to se3nd both backe for repairs. one more than once.They can't seem to keep accutate time for more than a week or keep stopping."
1,Deception,"I'm disappointed with this watch, its quality is very bad, the belt and the case are made with materials of a lower price watch, }I do not recommend it!Estoy decepcionado con este reloj, su calidad es muy mala, la correa y la caja estan hechas con materiales de un reloj de menor precio, no lo recomiendo"
2,CLOWN WATCH,"This is a big watch! I wanted a big face and numerals to help my aging eyesight, but was shocked to see how huge it was on my large wrist. The winder was also exaggerated, and offended my sense of proportion. The price was right, the pedigree was there, but the steroidal design displeased."
5,Tons of Scripture References,"The fact that there is at least one biblical reference on just about every page proves that the Pirolos' understanding of spiritual warfare is, well...biblical. Some people deny that we are in a war altogether and others have such convoluted ideas about the war, that they are completely ineffective in battle. The Pirolos' understanding of that war (based on scripture) and their own experiences (interpreted through scripture) are insightful and useful for any Christian's life."
3,Sounded better 25 years ago,"Okay, I had been looking for this on disc for a long time, and would've bought it again. It has some songs that were a lot funnier when played loud and drunk (?) when I was 20. Not as good now. What can you say, some people are people...some people are dogs."
3,Poor quality audio,"Being an avid fan of Carmine Meo and Etterna, I was thrilled to see Emma Shapplin had a DVD coming out, and preordered it. It was a big disappointment due to the sound only being in stereo, not 5.1 digital, and seemingly recorded with a portable tape recorder. That aside, the concert footage is just OK, with what seems to be an endless amount of editing, making it very difficult to actually see Emma sing. It is also relatively short, I doubt it is the entire concert. The end song has a fireworks display in the background, rendering it almost unhearable. A good DVD for absolute Emma fanatics only. Hopefully a 5.1 version with better sound will be released."
2,BUY THE CD INSTEAD,The sound quality is lacking a great deal. The cd of the concert offers better sound quality but on the upside this contains the original videos for the last 3 songs and the video quality is good. My advise is to buy the cd.
5,Jeff Waters can do no wrong,I just this bought album and let me tell you its one of the best all around metal albums i've ever heard. Its goes from all out thrashers like the title track and catchy mid tempo metallers like Knight Jumps Queen to beautiful ballads like Phoenix Rising. All with superb performances put in by all involved musicians and super clean production. Whether or not you're familiar with Annihilator and the genious of Jeff Waters this is as good a place to start as any. Stay Metal
5,LET ME LAUGH A LITTLE WHILE AT THE BAD REVIEWS: HAHAHAHAHAHA,"This is one of the best hard rock/metal albums i've ever listened! No crappy vocalist here.No musicians who don't have a clue.This is a work of art from two perspectives: Jeff had the guts and could reinvent Annihilator with this album.Still technical, still complex tempo changes and moods but with EXTREME melody and catchy choruses.He found a marvellous vocalist in Aaron Randall and the drums are perfect.Higly Recommended! Insanely funny but memorable nonetheless, this is my personal favorite Annihilator album."
5,Set your ears on Fire!!!,"This is defenitely the best Annihilator album for me. Because there are fast and slow songs. Great, great, great!! The ballad ""Pheonix Rising"" is one of the best songs I ever heard."
3,Its just ok,Its an average album -> not so good and not so bad. But its not like the previous albums. In the previous albums they play more technically but the music is completely ridiculous. In this album its just ok. I recommend this album to very fanatic m etal fans and to Annihilator fans. No more than this.
2,bad latin rhythms but USA aerobic steps,This is a joke workout. We do not recommend you buy it.A Latin rhythm workout. Ok maybe it has some really bad latin rhythms but the workout is a pure USA aerobic workout. Justbecouse you name some USA aerobic steps with latin dance names does not make it a latin dance workout.This video is a real disappointment.The aerobic workout itself is a very good length. But do not think it has anything really to do with latin dance.Vanessa's Afro Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac has much more latin steps in it.
5,Kiska's Voice,"Pamela Bauer Mueller understands cats better than anyone I know of. I read the book in two sittings and thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved Kiska's first book, ""The Bumpedy Road,"" which made me cry with pleasure! This second part of the trilogy has a little more cat philosophy, which we can all benefit from. I like the quotes at the end of some of the chapters, too. I wonder what actress could do Kiska's voice for a ""books on tape"" version? Just a fun thought."
4,It certainly is easy,"Arabic Made Easy takes you through the basic grammar and vocabulary of arabic in an organized, thoughtful way. After just a few days I could ask about someone's hat or say that I was looking at my house. The chpaters bring you into written Arabic in an easy-to-follow manner, after which you'll be able to read any newspaper - from right to left, of course."
5,A real redeemer,"Roger Simon has a terrific sense of how our political identities are rooted in so much more (or less) than the depth or purity of our ideas. We identify with those who are the models for the kind of person we think we are, or the group to which we want to belong, and in the process we lose sight of our real political objectives, if we ever knew what they were in the first place. This book explores this dilemma for Moses Wine as he grapples with his own personal history of the sixties in investigating the murder of the woman who symbolizes both his love and politics at that time. Now he must ask again, what really motivates our search for truth? I won't impose my solution to this fascinating mystery."
5,My Favorite Cologne,"I love Revlon products and have been using Jontue cologne for more years than I care to remember. Since I can no longer order directly from Revlon, I am most grateful that I can place my order through Amazon. The price and delivery service are unbelievable!"
5,Slinh,I just remodeled a 30 year old Mossberg 12 Ga. Bought a super all wood stock from Boyds that made an old relic like new. The sling is solid and beautiful....sets the gun off great...and it leather.
2,Lose weight have more energy and be happier in 10 days,not very please with this book. Book was old and the material was somewhat outdated. Also found book to be a boring read. No I would not recommend it
5,Helpful Guide,This book was wonderful! Any and everything that I had a question about was answered in the book. It is full of detailed accounts of people who tried the Lemonade Diet with success and some with little. I would buy the original Lemonade Diet (1976) and this one if I was doing this the 1st time around.
4,great book,"This book not only provides a wealth of information from the author's point of view, but also partakers of the experience that is the Master Cleanse as well. All those who have shared their experiences are just as important to the new readers as much as what the author is telling us."
2,"Fabulous cleanse, but a somewhat decent Book","The cleanse itself is a really good cleanse, that can be found in the original Master Cleanser Book by STanley Buroughs. But The Peter Glickman book doesnt really give you to much more different imformation. The book, if anything, is mainly just testimonials from people who have already tired it. I was expecting the book to have a little bit more information about the cleanse itself."
3,Amazing!,"I did it! I lost 13 pounds in 15 days and it was amazing. It was not hard, tho it did take focus. I saw how I reached for food out of boredom. But most of all, I feel so different inside of myself -- cleaner, fresher, and for me, slimmer! Plus it made me feel like I could accomplish a goal -- a big one!"
4,"Lose Weight, Have More Energy and be Happier in 10 Days.",This book is a good support to the Master Cleanser handbook.It backs up the booklet with some helpful guidance. It helps you to feel confident that you are following Stanley Burroughs correctly. Some of it is repetitive but overall I found it helpful and supportive.
3,Useful information to get you started and going on your cleanse,"This book contains some good information to get you through your cleanse and understand which days might be hardest and some interesting detoxing symptoms. Fundamentally, reading the Master Cleanse by Stanley Burroughs could be enough to give you the information you need, but there is something very helpful about getting information from an author who has done so many cleanses."
2,Disorganized,Book is primarily quotes from others during different periods of their fast. Could be much better if info was not duplicted so often and experiencial quotes were organized by fast timeline
2,Not Helpful,"I have to say that I am really dissapointed I purchased this book. I was looking for a guide to help me prepare and organize my daily schedule in order to succussfully do the master cleanse. This book starts out interesting only in the first chapter. The whole rest of the book, looks like the author copied pages from his blog and basically just published a book of peoples comments on his blog. very dissapointed. Not helpful to me and really I could have gotten more information online. You do not need to purchase this book. Sorry."
2,Broken Record,The book is very informative but can be summed up in one chapter. The 154 pages in this book read like a broken record. The information is repeated over and over again.
5,I have Success and Feel Better Each Time I Cleanse,"I've done the cleanse 5 or 6 times by now. Before my first one I studied the book and listened to the CD so that I would be prepared. I always review before I do another cleanse.The book answers all my questions, especially about symptoms. I may not have all the symptoms each time I do the cleanse, but I recognize them when they come up.Thank you for doing such a comprehensive job on the book. It makes the experience easier for me - and it's easier each time I do it.Wendy Weber, The Singing Network Marketer"
3,"Useful in a way, but mostly redundant","As others have mentioned, this book serves more as an adjunct to the Burroughs book than a stand alone resource. It is like the earlier book--but just piled higher and deeper. It is more udseful as an inspirational tool, as it helps to read all those first person accounts of the Cleanse. Gives you something to do while you are not eating."
5,"Great book for those who don't have the net, especially! :)","I spend quite a lot of time on the Master Cleanse website/forums. Believe it or not there are still people who don't have internet access so therefore aren't able to access all this wonderful information.I am so glad Peter has written this great book as I bought it for a friend who had tried the cleanse but struggled with it.This is a wonderful book filled with suggestions, helpful questions and support!I LOVE the Master Cleanse/Lemonade Diet!!!And, I love this book!Thanks so much, Peter!Gayle"
2,Not as good as it should have been,This book wasn't written very well. It didn't have enough information on the topic and repeats information in the book too many times. I would have preferred a more logical book than the detail from his blog site. It wasn't organized and overall was written poorly. It barely gave me the information I needed and was tedious to find information in it. The topic was interesting and there are other books that have better information and are written better.
5,Feel and be well,"Lose Weight, Have More Energy & Be Happier in 10 Days by Peter Glickman is a really good book to read and follow if you really want to be healthy and feel full of life! The Master Cleanse Program is explained fully in this easy to understand update of the small book written by Stanley Burroughs called The Master Cleanser. I've done 10 Master Cleanses that range from 10 - 40 days and they've all been successes.Peter Glickman has helped many people get back on the road to good health by providing a fantastic raw food site that goes along with reading this most informative book on how to successfully do a Master Cleanse and detox your body. I also have the CD that goes along with this book and it too is very helpful.I've lost and kept off about 65 pounds in the past few years and could not have done it without this helpful book."
5,Amazing but it works!,"I couldn't believe that it was so easy for me to stay on this for the whole ten days (while cooking dinner each night,no gum & no chocolate!, teaching preschool, dentist appointment with sedation, camping weekend and traveling internationally while 'coming off'--an admittedly exceptional schedule for me) I had more energy than usual, fewer naps, better sleep, better attitudes and I did lose 10 pounds-that's a feat for me (and kept it off since!!!) Whenever I felt 'hungry', drinking the lemonade would squelch it, though I missed chewing sometimes. Loved it and am anxious to do it again with my husband. (He also did it, starting a week after me because of his travel schedule and though more challenged generally, felt it worthwhile)"
4,To our health,"Helpful resource and handy to keep around for reference. I've seen the book before but needed my own copy. Thanks for a relevant, substantive and good service."
5,The most AMAZING results!!!!!!!!!!,You will not believe how good you will feel in just 10 days. An awesome bonus will be weight loss but you must follow the directions to the letter. Thank you Peter for putting together this book will such useful information. I also love that you added testimonials from people who actually had the same questions that I had. This is a must read and you would be surprised how 10 days can totally change your life!!!
3,A great way to feel better...but a lot of hype and hot air..,"I tried this 'book' and program at the recommendation of a friend who was also on the cleansing plan. I will admit that I didn't find the lemonade diet that difficult, and the logic was straight forward - but after 3 weeks though I noticed some minor physical changes, it wasn't enough for me to integrate this into my life on a permanent basis.I did a consdierable amount of research on the claims and opinions of the writer and while some were accurate, there were some assumptions and opinions that were complete non-sense.Overall, this is a good book if that is your sort of thing. I don't recommend it is used as a bible to nutrition, but you might get something out of it."
5,Great details in this Book!,This is a great book to read for anyone comtemplating doing the master cleanse. It has great details of Peter's experiences and also of other people he has led through the cleanse. It also contains typical day to day details and which days are typically the worst to get through! Recomended reading!
2,nothing new,"This is just questions and answers/information taken from a colon cleanse support group. Nothing new. The answers repeat often times in different places in the book.If you are going to do this colon cleanse diet, the personal stories might be helpful, otherwise I am not so sure."
2,lose weight quick books are a scam! which is exactly what I told my boyfriend before and after he bought this ridiculous book,"The book was in great condition and arrived in good time. However, losing weight quickly is dangerous and unhealthy. The authors of books such as these are unscroupulous. Their only want is to make money at anothers expense. I do not approve of dieting schemes and I abhor anyone who writes of such nonsense."
3,Overpriced for info,"The book does give great advice about the fast, but most of the content is taken from previous posts from Glickman's website. Could have gone to this at no charge and gotten a bulk of the information presented in this book. All in all I did not find it worth the cost."
2,Blog,"This is more of a blog that the author published. I was hoping for more detailed instructions. Secondly, half of the book is personal testmonies for the selected people that have tried this progam. Over all I would say this book adds little value and you should probably buy the origional book."
5,Loaded With Information,"I have braved through the Master Cleanse 3 times now. I'm not going to lie, it can be a tough experience and put you face to face with personal challenges like what role does food play in your life? Food satisfied me on many levels other than just something in my stomach. I realized I ate for many reasons...boredom, anxiety, thirst, etc. The M.C. made me face these challenges which made me feel a lot freer in the end, because I no longer used food as a crutch but rather one of the multiple means to good health.There are a lot of pitfalls and details regarding this fast, and this author covers most of them. There is a lot of practical information. Highly recommended. Here's to Better Health! Your body will thank you..."
5,Publisher of best selling diet books prefers Glickman's LOSE WEIGHT...to Craig Claiborne's,"As the publisher of the number one bestselling CRAIG CLAIBORNE GOURMET DIET, I have tried both Glickman's and Claiborne's regimes, and Glickman's works far better.I lost 20 lbs in 10 days, and made a major alteration to my permanent diet that keeps the weight off. The diet is simple, sound, easy to master and execute and it works.Most diets are about as complicated as IRS instructions for your tax return and one can quickly find an excuse for giving up.Following up the diet with a sigmoidoscopy to take advantage of the newly cleared intestinal tract should be the ultimate way to detect and prevent colon and intestinal cancers.Any book this short that is this clear and this good should be in everyone's library."
4,"is it really ""Thee masters cleanse""?","I used the book and started the master cleanse shortly after. The lemonade was very delicious (especially with lots of cayenne), but I had a few concerns. Not only was my busy life at the hospital getting slowed down, but it also made me think how good could all this acid on your teeth and in your stomach be for you. I was also apauled that I was drinking a ""bottle"" of maple syrup every 2 days. YUCK... I ended up stopping on day 6 because I started getting sick. I felt my immune system was low on defenses or all the toxins in my colon that were coming out were acting up.Overall the cleanse did work in a way. If you can get past the salt water flush and the 2 hours in the bathroom afterwords then you should be fine.I definately feel I need to try a more herbal method of cleansing to feel a little more on the healthier side.Sarah"
1,"Um, DUH!","You're seriously wondering why you lose weight when you're drinking TONS of water with only two tablespoons of lemon juice in it? Yeah, yeah, the maple syrup has all kinds of minerals and calories, blah blah. You can't live on maple syrup. I liked the salt water flush, but I realized how completely unhealthy it was. This ""cleanse"" was the stupidest thing ever.Do you want to cleanse yourself? Lose weight? Lose wrinkles? Look years younger? Cure/prevent illness and disease? Become a raw vegan. You can eat as much as you want and STILL lose massive amounts of weight! And you're actually getting all the vital nutrients you need. You WILL get rid of all the toxins in your body and repair all your organs and cells by going raw. You don't need this."
2,Don't waste your money,"I don't know why this book was rated so high by people? I think it's a waste of money, it's mostly input from people who are cleansing which is a lot of questions and non helpful info. And when I went to the section on how to complete the cleanse it only gives some info and then says to refer to Burroughs for detailed info on how to complete the cleanse! I bought this book so IT would give me that info, now I have to buy another book just to get that info!Don't waste your money!"
2,Not what i expected,I was thinking this book was going to explained more the concept of Staley Burough but most of the book is question posted on the web that you can read if you visit it.
4,happy in 10 days,"The book is ok,mostly filled with reviews. It doesn't address the finer points of fasting, but overall worth the money!"
4,Heavy duty!,"This paper towel rack is VERY stiff, as another reviewer mentioned. It bent the edge of the carboard tube when I was installing it, but that doesn't affect its ability to spin at all. Very modern and clean lines and exceptionally well built. Four stars for difficulty loading the paper towels."
3,dimensions?,I find it hard to believe the dimensions are as stated: 15-1/2 by 13 by 6-1/2 inches. Does anyone know the real dimensions? Paper towel holders are usually closer to 13 x 6 x 6 (<-- measured w/ a towel roll in it).
3,Nice effort,"Bought this because the plastic holders always let the roll pop out. This holder will not, but good luck getting the roll in it, it is a bit to rigid."
1,Horrible Design,"I bought 3 of these by mistake. They are very high quality, but too high, they have no flexibilty and are far too rigid. I have tried bending them to no avail. It is hard to get the paper towels into the unit, then if the roll falls off, because it doesn't spin well when in it, it is impossible to get them back in without bending the paper towel's cardboard. I am replacing them all tomorrow, a horrible purchase, be warned!"
2,"Looks great, but flawed design","I purchased this product because it looked great and sturdy online. It was easy enough to install and is made of quality materials. Unfortunately, as a few other reviewers have pointed out, it's impossible to insert a roll of paper towel. After a few weeks it started driving my wife nuts so now I'm throwing it out and looking for a better one."
4,It is definitely better than the old magnetic holder stuck to the fridge,"The description of the product is accurate. The brushed steel looks nice,is very sturdy, and is low profile, hard to really notice it under the upper cabinets unless you know it is there. My only complaint is it holds the paper towel roll very tightly, even squishing it. The paper towel roll is still able to turn just not as freely as I would like. I hope/expect it to fit better as time goes on and I change more rolls since you need to forcefully spread out the sides to fit the paper towels into it."
2,Paper towel holder,"I gave it two stars... I love the looks and the quality, but if you buy large rolls of paper towels from Costco, it's impossible to get them off the roll until half the paper towels are gone. As other reviewers have stated, it's much to rigid (i.e. great quality) to bend the arms back to accommodate larger rolls."
1,"beautiful, sturdy, but the rolls don't fit","We really wanted this paper towel holder to work. It is all one piece, sturdy, and a very nice stainless steel--which would have worked well in our kitchen. However, the bit about ""allows for quick replacement of emptied rolls"" is misleading. We spent 3-5 minutes trying to wiggle one of our paper towel rolls into it- before realizing that it was not made for large paper towel rolls. We returned it."
1,don't buy this,"It is beautiful and strong, but you cannot get the paper towel roll in without collapsing the roll. Then it won't spin."
2,Very annoying,"I like the minimal design, but functionally this thing is driving me crazy. It doesn't have enough give so it smashes the cardboard roll every time you put a new roll in. It works for a while and then when the roll gets low it falls off because the structure of the cardboard is compromised. Poor design in my opinion."
5,Nicely Made,"Solidly built, looks good, works good. I have nothing to complain about with this item.Yes, it's slightly challenging to load the towels. But it's much better than having the roll fall out every time you try to tear a sheet off. The tight grip on the towel roll makes tearing off a section really easy. I've found the easiest way to load the towel is to insert one end of the roll on one ear, then PUSH INWARDS on the other ear to open it up insert the other side. That's much easier than trying to pull the ears apart.Regarding the hardware, it works perfectly on drywall. If you plan to mount it anywhere else (wood, tile, etc.) you'll have to source the appropriate hardware yourself. As is the case with just about any product where you choose the mounting location. You can't expect a manufacturer to include hardware for every possible mounting situation. It would have to come with a whole box of screws. So to all you idiots that complain about the hardware on every damn review, get a clue!"
3,Way Too Tight - A Fight Every Time,"In appearance, this is unobtrusive and just right. It's far too tight though to put the paper towels into. Invariably you slide one end on and then the pressure needed to pry the other end enough to get the roll in crushes part of that end's cardboard roll, and it's never really on right (works fine though until the towels are almost gone, then it pulls away when you pull a towel).For whatever reason, one side on mine is harder than the other, so I have learned to work with it and pry the side on the left rather than the right. Try yours to see if there's any difference.You might also try standing this up on the counter and trying to put a roll in before you ever mount it, then pry it apart to loosen until it becomes easy, THEN mount it.It shouldn't be this hard, but in all other respects it's a well designed product, and just disappears into the decor without being noticed, which I like about it."
2,Not that happy,"It's great looking and very sturdy, but with absolutely no flexibility to it it's virtually impossible to install a roll of paper towels without crushing the end of the inner cardboard tube. Needless to say, this greatly inhibits the ability to dispense the towels properly and sometimes leads to the roll of towels twisting off of the holder completely. Despite my love of all things stainless steel, I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,Too Sturdy,"Although it is well made and nice looking, there is no spring tension at all. One must completely deform the roll of paper towels in order to insert it into position."
3,no good for france,"I live in France and bought this product, but unfortunately kitchen roll siz standard throughout the world, so the kitchen roll we have here wasn't long enough to be able to use this product. It looked really nice though..."
2,Attractive but dysfunctional,"Looks like a work of art, but it's so heavy I can't get towels in and out easily. It would be a better product if they removed 80% of the steel."
4,Attractive,Looks great with my stainless appliances. I have it hanging under and from my cabinet. I am very pleased with this item.
3,"Paper Towel Holder not what I wanted, but works","I was looking for two undermount paper towel holders for our new kitchen. I wanted the rubbermaid type that I had in my old house, just something functional because it is hidden behind the moulding. The Wingo is the only thing I could find (other than some cheap plastic things). It is over-engineered for strength, and under-engineered for function. I mounted it securely and it is very strong. So strong that it takes all I can do to insert a new roll of towels in the holder. I have an idea I will try after the Holidays. I will remount it and put thick washers on the screws between the holder and the bottom of cabinet. Maybe that will give the metal holder some room to bend when loading a new towel in the holder."
3,"Decent novel, but disappointing (some spoilers)","Blake tries to go in too many directions with this sequel to ""Dances With Wolves"". He knows that after the film, people are invested in all the characters, so he tries to switch between them all. This leads to a certain amount of plot confusion, and in the end, none of the characters is truly served. This is a sequel to the book rather than the movie, so as it starts, Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist are still living among the Comanche. I did not like how Stands reverted back to her angry, animalistic self again in this story, and Dances is almost a supporting character. And of course it ends with the cliched native american ending, the white man lies to them, and pretty much anything native is wiped out by the end. That makes sense from a historical standpoint, but at least a few of the characters could have had individually more happy endings.Book came in good shape, speedy service."
5,great book,Didn't know there was a sequel to Dances with Wolves until after watching a bio of the making of Dances with Wolves. After hearing about it decide to get the book. It's amazing. Wish that there would of been a movie but after reading I understand why it would of been a very very long movie to cover everything in the book the way Dances with Wolves was there is not anything in the book of Dances with Wolves that was not covered in the movie. Michael Blank is a excellent writer. I plan to purchase more of his books.
5,best gift I ever found for my sister on Amazon,My sister always spoke of this book because she loves Dances with Wolves so much. This is the continuation of that story and she has always wanted it. She is reading it now and is enjoying it tremendously. We recommend this book and this seller. The book arrived when promised. It came wrapped elegantly and it arrived undamaged.Thank you to all for a wonderful surprise.
4,A Non-Historical Novel,"Although I could find no verifiable historical facts within the writing, it is a good read and has a good plot. It is PROBABLY typical of the events that could have happened during the time frame exhibited. I recommend the Novel for an enjoyable reading.fred shannon"
3,The Holy Road,To much history mixed with fiction. Blake uses historical events and persons to write a mostly fictional book. Not enjoyabel for a historical interested person.
3,Historical? Maybe not. Worthwhile read? Yes.,"I heard an interview with Gary Paulsen after listening to one of his ""Tucket"" series books. He talks specifically about the historical inaccuracies in the Dances with Wolves series. I am inclined to agree with his assessment that an army officer in uniform would not have made it into a Comanche town alive after the Civil War. However, both Dances with Wolves and The Holy Road are interesting and thought provoking reads. Be prepared though, you probably won't like how The Holy Road ends. I was angry with how he killed off one of his main characters. It was glossed over too quickly in the book; Blake doesn't give the reader time to grieve the loss of a major character. If you like this book, I recommend reading Ride the Wind by Lucia St. Clair Robson."
1,Waste of Time!,"I loved reading Dances with Wolves, but Holy Road is a sore disappointment! I can't believe it's written by the same author. Blake spends chapters describing hallucinations and slaughter houses, but only a page on the death of the hero and other main characters. Way too many characters and way too disjointed. Holy Road lacks a cohesive story. I only read it because I enjoyed the original so much. If I hadn't read Dances with Wolves first, I would have put Holy Road down after the first forty pages. My opinion...watch the epic movie and leave it at that."
2,boooringgg,"it's a great historical perspective, but possesses none of the magic of discovery, introspection and adventure of one person in the last book...Dances with Wolves. Sure would have liked more of his continuing story and voyage through his personal journey. Too many Indian names, too many battles, and in all probability, too close to a historical perspective than a novel that continues Dunbars journey. His death in battle is one line, with no embellishments...dismiss the former hero.Finished it, but like the reviewers said, left me with an empty stomach."
5,This is not your average rock band.,i first heard about these guys from a friend in L.A. but i didn't get a chance to hear them until now. this is truly unique shtuff. no boring formula rock here. everything from the lyrics to the cover art to the great instrumentation. this is a band to keep yer thirsty ear drooling for!
3,"It's Good, But Not Great","Being a Steppenwolf fan for several years, I fianlly decided to purchase the compilation of hits that were available on 16 Greatest Hits...... I can honestly say that I wasn't thrilled with it. Although it is good, the individual albums gave me a sense of greater satisfaction. I do give this album a ""thumbs up"" however, other Steppenwolf albums are better."
5,Probably the best U.S band of the sixties,"I really liked this album. Steppenwolf were the first band I really liked when I was growing up. I listened to all their albums, and liked each one. BUY this album. You won't be dissapointed!"
3,Disappointing CD Format,"This is a decent book/CD package for the money but could be better. The typical page has five riffs (Rock, Blues or R&B, Jazz, Country and Funk) at both normal and slow speeds. This product's shortcoming is in the CD format. All five of the riffs on a page are all on a single CD track. That's ten riffs (normal + slow) per track. That means you must to wade through the unwanted riffs to get what you want unless you're only interested in rock which is always listed first. Personally, I find listening to some of slow rock riffs excruciating. At a minimum, a time indicator at the beginning of each riff would have been nice. For example: The blues riff is located 19 seconds into track 23. So, instead of listing the riff as ""Blues"" it could have just as easily been listed as ""Blues 00:19""."
4,Good for the price of admission,"I have a few riff books (like the 100 killer licks & chops books)and like them all as they give mea taste of the full song without miring me down with the whole production of intro, verse, chorus, Etc. Etc. and Ican then go for the full blown version, or not.They can also add a quick building block that you can use later as an add in to something you put together on your own.It is broken down into Major, Minor, Dominant 7th chord groups with 5 riffs per page covering Rock, R&B;, Jazz, Country, and Funk with a special 12 bar section at the end.These books always leave something to be desired, as you either don't like the riff, or you want more.You either like these things, or you don't.I like them and wish more were available.It also helps to have a guitar trainer that can loop the riff. (Just a thought)"
2,Not about rhythm guitar technique (and a matter of taste whether you like the riffs),"I bought the book in the belief, from its title, that it was about rhythm guitar technique - I should have investigated more carefully, I guess.Some samples are played with quite a high distortion level - ok if it's your taste, but it makes it a bit more difficult to hear note-for-note what is being played - and it grates a bit if you don't like heavy distortion.For me, the biggest problem is that I just did not not like the riffs - many of them sound to me like odd bits and pieces pasted together and I did not find any that I yearned to play. A matter of taste, I suppose, but on the assumption that other potential readers might have a similar reaction, I can't give a strong recommendation to the book."
1,Kindle edition is worthless on iPad,I cannot comment how this book work on Kindle device but it was not usable at all when viewed via Kindle app on iPad2. Images (actual music) were VERY poorly scanned - too small to read and fuzzy when enlarged and and music samples simply did not work on iPad at all. Luckily Amazon has excellent customer support and there was no problem returning it.
1,Not Godzilla's Best,This movie was not the best godzilla . He had more of a puppy dog look . Godzilla was asleep in the movie and mostly was awake in the ending . He fought a giant shrimp which was really cheesey. The story moves slow and you just want to fall asleep . It mostly focuses on the people who are on the island . Not that great of a picture .
2,There is no accounting for taste.,"Godzilla and a giant crab (or shrimp, whatever) do battle near a remote island where a nefarious band of super criminals tampers with nuclear energy and enslaves innocent natives. By the mid-'60s, the most generous thing one can say of Japanese sci-fi is that it was chuckle-headed camp humor. This juvenile sci-fi flick is okay for ""kiddies"" that do not discriminate against bad movies. Godzilla appears as a bizarre antihero that protects the innocent and saves humanity. The special effects add to the chuckles of viewers who understand the unique appeal of cheesy movies. Joel and the robots of MST3K fame once gave this film the royal treatment. When the giant monsters bat a large rock back and forth like a volleyball...well, you get the idea. Sensible viewers beware. ;-)"
2,Godzilla vs. the sea food buffet.,"Who's more powerful than King Kong? What creature is smarter than Mothra, more agile than Rodan, and more terrifying than King Ghidorah? Why, a giant shrimp, of course! Why not just throw in a mutated hush puppie and a monstrous bowl of alien cole-slaw? Heck, during the fight, the monsters can destroy a tartar/cocktail sauce factory. Coming off the high of Monster Zero, ToHo takes a giant step backward with an all-new creative team at the helm. Some view this as a refreshing change of pace. However, director Jun Fukada's spy film influences just don't belong in the Godzilla universe. Masuro Sato's score, while complementing the visuals, just can't compare to the Maestro's work. The actors perform well, especially ToHo regulars Akira Takarada and Kumi Mizuno, and are pretty well-developed. The inclusion of Mothra seems rather arbitrary and is not handled with much care. The less said about Ebirah(the Sea Monster), the better. A minor G-film."
2,Godzilla vs. a Lobster,This movie hardly had the sea monster appear. he was in the middle and the very end. it should of been Godzilla vs. An Island. Godzilla obvious is funny looking and the effects are terrible. Kind of dissapointing and funny.
2,Man Im Hungry Lobster Sounds Fine,First off this original monster instead of Ebirah I think thats how you spell it was suppose to be King Kong but somethine got mixed up in the script or the company rights of kong but any ways this movie hmmmmm sucks.Sorry but the storyline is not so hot and godzilla is awaken from him sleep you know he was pissed off and fights this overgrown lobster waiting to be cook and finish off the people who were smuggling in stuff.Basically to tell you truth fromother review this is a cheesy flick really I mean cheesy.But go ahead and watch see if you like it or buy to add to your G videos database but overal its not that good.
5,Great Godzilla movie,One of the best Gozilla movies ever. I think Ebirah is so cool. I like the fighting scene with the rock.
3,OK Godzilla Movie,"First off,I kind of like this one.It takes a break from the usual city smashing film.Also,it has a good setting,and good storyline.However, Ebirah is just a perverbial whipping boy,as Godzilla just has his way with him.Also,what the heck is with the giant Condor.Still,a decent movie."
4,Godzilla Vs. The sea monster,The movie is o.k for the time that it was made. The godzilla suit looks good. One of the cool things about the suit is that Godzillas eyes move. The monster Ebirah [the sea monster] looks good. Great movie!
2,WAKE UP MOTHRA!!!!!!!!,"GODZILLA IS AFTER THE BAD GUYS INCLUDING A GIANT LOBSTER WITH ONE BIG CLAW AND AN ANNOYING SCREECH. HOWEVER HIS SCREECH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE VOICE OF ONE OF THE DUBBED ACTORS WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF CATS CAUGHT IN A LAWNMOWER. MOTHRA SLEEPS THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE UNTIL THE VERY END WHEN HE RESCUES THE NATIVES FROM THE ISLAND WHICH IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE. MOTHRA MUST HAVE BEEN IN A COMA SINCE THE NATIVES OF INFANT ISLAND DID NOTHING BUT SING AND DANCE UNTIL MOTHRA AWOKE.DURING THE ATTACK BY THE AIRFORCE OF THE RED BAMBOO (THE BAD GUYS), GODZILLA DANCED WHILE DESTROYING THE JET FIGHTERS. HE ALSO PLAYED BASEBALL WITH EBIRAH, THE LOBSTER ON STEROIDS.THE MOVIE WAS KIND OF SILLY BUT STILL ENJOYABLE. ALL IN ALL, THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER GODZILLA MOVIES WHICH ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
3,Not enough monster action!,"Godzilla dosnt appear until 40 mins in, and Ebirah is kinda annoying, but if your a hardcore fan, then go for it."
3,One of the Good Ole Campy G-Films,"Sony is releasing five of the last Showa films, including our favorite seafood battles, ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"". This fun film is finally on DVD and it's a decent DVD, at least in appearance. Though the menu is just another still from the movie. The DVD basically presents the original Japanese version released back in 1966. The U.S. version isn't included. This is kind of a bummer for me but whatever. But from there the quality really goes downhill. Classic Media really tries to make the DVD and the film a pleasurable experience, with all thier special features and all thier special features and all (plus both versions). This DVD, as most of Tri-star's, is featureless, not to impressive. On the bright side, the film is still digitally re-mastered so in the end I give it three stars."
3,Not exactly what I remembered.,"Die hard Godzilla fans will end up liking this, and I have to say, that I will likely watch it again. But this viewing has solidly shaken the veneer of childhood remembrance off of the movie. It's not as good as I remembered, however the target audience is children, and that is how I remembered it. My kids still enjoy it, and if you own any of the other Godzilla movies, this one isn't a bad one to add to the collection"
2,Godzilla Goofiness,"I love Godzilla movies, and this one is just pure retro fun. I'd rather have seen more of Godzilla than the drama about the human cast but that's a common lament I have with all Godzilla movies, actually."
3,One of the most underrated Godzilla films.,"Summary: Godzilla must battle a giant lobster to protect natives held captive on a remote tropical island.One of the most underrated and underappreciated Godzilla efforts. A light-hearted and fun action/adventure film. Mothra makes a guest appearance toward the films conclusion.Next is ""Son of Godzilla""."
3,ONE OF MY FAVORITE GODZILLA MOVIES!,"THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW GODZILLA MOVIES WITH A PLOT.THOUGH THE ACTING WAS POOR, THE MOVIE WAS FUN .THE SCENE WITH GODZILLA AND THE SEA MONSTER WAS SORTA DUMB. I LIKE THE PART WHEN GODZILLA DESTROYS THE RED BAMBOOS BASE."
2,a Boring Movie,"This movie is definitely not worth watching. The action scenes were nothing to look at and the fight between Godzilla nad Ebirah practically made me fall asleep. If you expect a Godzilla with good special effects and action, you won't see it in this movie."
3,Great Presentation of an OK Godzilla Movie,"Yes, this movie has never looked better. Like other reviewers, I had the VHS and it was sad. If you're into Godzilla and have been waiting for a great print of this to become available, now is he time to snatch this up.This was originally written as a follow up to King Kong Escapes and was to feature King Kong, but when the owners of Kong backed out, Toho inserted Godzilla. Some footage from previous movies here, but they are hard to notice and overall the film is well done. The Sea Monster is kind of lack luster and isn't much of a challenge for Godzila. Basically, your average Godzilla movie."
3,Godzilla finally tastes the wonder of seafood,"In this, the seventh Godzilla film the Big G battles a giant lobster(named Ebirah) in order to save a group of people from evil terrorists. Mothra appears to rescue the frightened people in the nick of time. I liked the monster action for this Godzilla movie had good battles even though nothing good happens for an abnormally long time."
5,Love This One,This is one of my favorites Godzilla is great in it some humor of course along with action and typical characters. The last battle with Ebirah (The Sea Monster is great) Godzilla making crab legs out of him and then taunting him with the claws by banging them together I love that part. I just enjoy this movie although I usually enjoy any Godzilla's this is one is at the top of my list.
5,Fried Lobster and a giant condor/turkey thing!,"This was the first Godzilla movie I owned, and I still own it. It is a great movie, and is ten times better than that AWFUL American Godzilla movie! This is one of the best in the Showa series, and one of the most comical, too. Especially the giant bird. Buy it! You'll love it, guarenteed!"
4,Godzilla becomes James Bond,"What a weird movie! Bowing to the spy craze of the 1960's, director Jun Fukuda has Godzilla fighting the SPECTRE-like Red Bamboo and a giant crab named Ebirah. Inoshiro Honda's previous films in the series delivered their message about the dangers of nuclear weapons well, but Fukuda turns the series 180 degrees and goes for sheer entertainment instead. Eschewing the city smashing of the previous films, in Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster we get beautiful island girls, tropical locations, a bank robber turned hero, mysterious hideouts and, best of all, a hilarious victory dance by Godzilla. Add in Mothra and the Peanuts (the two little girls who control Mothra) and you have one entertaining and strange hybrid. If you're a Godzilla purist, you'll hate this movie. But if you give it a chance, you'll be surprised at how enjoyable it is."
3,"Godzilla vs. Ebirah, The Sea Monster","Don't expect ""Macbeth"" from this film. What ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"" lacks though in drama, it makes up for sheer whimsey. This is a fun flick. Exotic locales; a ""B"" movie subplot about a sinister organization; a menagerie of monsters not seen this side of ""Destroy All Monsters"" serve to make this film a busy, lively affair. There is nothing weighty to ponder here, but the story is engaging nonetheless. Jun Fukuda keeps events moving at a healthy pace."
5,Great book for Audiologists and ENT surgeonsGr,"Great structure of the themes, lo recomendaria para todos aquellos que tratan a personas con problemas auditivos y tienen distintas necesidadesde amplificacion, I'll recommend this book for those professionals who deal and treat persons with hearing deficits."
2,Too old but some ok basic concepts,"This book was published in 2001. As such there is no information regarding open fit OTE hearing aids. I also could not find any information regarding cochlear dead regions and the use of hearing aid fitting for patients who may have that problem.If you can find a cheap used copy maybe think about it but overall it is a dated reference. Do an internet search at Hearing Journal, Hearing Review, American Academy of Audiology, or any number of other sites and get better more up to date information then this."
5,The end of the original,"Yes, you read that right, it's the end of the original series that made up Voltron. Find out what happens."
3,it's UNO,I love Haba games - but this is just a picture version of UNO. Not that that's bad. But that's what it is.
5,An excellent resource,"Written in three sections. The first section presents 24 simple rules to apply when interpreting the Bible. The second section presents several study methods, and the third suggests ways to improve bible study skills."
1,Don't buy it as a nail clipper,I threw this 'clipper' away after one attempt at use on fingernails. it made through 8 digits and it died. waste of $.
1,Not recommended,"Not recommendedFor starters, in order to ""clip to your keyring,"" you open the nail clippers and hook the blades over the keyring, then lock the handles together."
1,"Very poor, low, quality product",The finger nail clipper is not capable of cutting through a finger nail. The blade edges are not properly aligned. There are very cheap plastic elements with an overall cheap feel. Do not buy this product with any expectation of satisfaction.
3,Function not great,"blade not sharp, clippers worked good a few times, however the light comes in handy. works better as a tool to use while fishing."
2,Not good,Too many things in one product and none of them work effectively. Please look out or something simpler and cheaper..
4,Best Nail Clipper/Pocket Tool,"Pros: almost everything. notably the clipper locks closed and the the handles are long enough to give leverage for even the most ""robust"" toe nails :)Cons: the nail file could have a more aggressive bite and the latches would be better if they were all metal."
4,Handy nail clippers PLUS!,"Do your nail clippers have a LED flashlight, scissors and other tools? I didn't think so!"
5,Great product!,These really do come in handy! Great addition to my tool set. Nice for those tight places where other screw drivers just can't go. The grip is very nice! Let's face it when your in a small space where your hand can't get a good grip it's very frustrating. But with these you have a nice rubber grip to hang on to. It makes life a lot easier.
4,Nice little pliers,This stubby pliers come in handy when working in tight spaces. They have nice rubber tipped handles as well.
3,Not an official release,"Thsi isn't an officical release (as per Olivia's management). It is good quality nevertheless, the sound quality is average."
1,Does what it says,It came all nice and shinny after first use the paint/ shinny came off in water makes me nervous of what chemicals are comming off!
1,Inadequate light / misleading labeling,The light is inadequate - you may as well use an unlit mirror. The box states the mirror operates at 75 watts but the instructions inside state that you cannot use any more than a 13 watt bulb. I assume this is what was provided since the light is worthless. This experience adds to my growing perception that Brookstone charges huge markups for oftentimes mediocre products.
3,"It's a good song, but there's too many swears.","I liked the song What it's like, it has a great theme, and tune, and Everlast has an awesome voice, but he swears way too much in the song"
5,arthur and the invisibles,i just loved this film its great. i saw it on tv here. and just had to buy it and the entire series. it's a feel good movie for all age's believe me i know seeing how im 24 and just love it to death.
3,Cute movie but ugh the voices...,"I loved everything about this movie except for most of the choices of voice actors for the characters. David Bowie was great as the villain. The rest... Bateman, De Niro, awful! Madonna as the princess and little kid's love interest?! PLEASE! Sadly, I feel these things really ruined an adoreable movie. I understand they got big name actors to help draw people, but the casting was bad... really bad. I would have much rather had no named people who's voices fit the look of the characters."
3,"Excellent movie, but censored version!","I saw this movie in a German edition first. So I bought it for my daughter in Amazon.com. But the disappointment came as soon as I saw the american version of the film. At least 10 minutes less of the original version because there are many portions which were censored by who knows who. The level of hipocresy of the americans is unbelievable. They converted a very good movie, with a lot of blinks for adults in a light version adapted for the typical stupidity and double moral of the americans. If you want to watch this movie, by the European version, not the american."
4,Charming film,"Invisibles is quality family entertainment. It's a fairy-tale that's one part live actors and one part animation, but it's not your standard Pixar fare. The animation is more like anime, and has the feel of a ps-2 game.Freddie Highmore does a fine job again, as Arthur. You may remember him from Charlie and the Choc Factory, and from an obscure little gem called ""Finding Neverland"" (both with Johnny Depp).There's enough quality voice-acting here to satisfy anybody, but David Bowie's sardonic performance is outstanding. And Mia Farrow is still so beautiful and has aged very gracefully. It was a pleasure to see her again."
3,Arthur and the Invisibles,it was cute the kids liked it and it kept them engaged in the action an drama. The animation was great.
5,Good family fun.,I purchased this DVD to replace a lost dvd. The story combines classic themes of family struggle with a futuristic good verses evil with the menimoses and evil m.
3,Excellent Movie and Story,"You are probably wondering why I only gave this 3 stars with the title ""Excellent Movie and Story"". The reason why, is because this DVD (the US version) is the censored/shorter version. This is an excellent movie with an excellent story that can be loved by both kids and adults. While the movie is great, I do not recommend buying this version. Instead I recommend buying the Blue-Ray imported version that gives you the full-version to the film, plus it's on Blue-Ray. Here is the link for it:Arthur and the Invisibles (2006) ( Arthur et les Minimoys ) ( Arthur and the Minimoys ) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - France] I bought this and the second I received it in the mail I watched it with my PS3 and it's been great."
2,upset at the home release version,"when my wife and i saw it in the theater we thought it was cute and funny but then when we bought it on dvd they edit out a lot and made it obviouse they edit out stuff. some of the seens are not understandabule because of what they edit out.. but for some reasion i swear it was a pg-13 rateing in the theater and only a pg rateing on dvd.. it is like 30 mins shorter on dvd release then what i saw in the theater.. very dissapointing, but if you have no idea what i am talking about then it is a good movie. but because i know all of the sceans they deleted it was ruined for me"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"This is a great movie. I bought it on DVD and I was IMPRESSED!! Freddie Highmore and Madonna were great. It also has Jimmy Fallon, and Robert DeNiro. This is a great film for all ages! Your whole family will enjoy this movie!!"
4,Genre worthy,"Anyone into Disney-Pixar type animation, magic & fun will enjoy this movie, especially since the animation style is a bit different than some of the more popular ones. All-star cast of characters & voices lends appeal to young & old. The storyline & crossovers between real acting & animation are well-done I thought. Simple enough for younger audiences, yet rich enough for adults if you're a fan of family-friendly adventure, fantasy, magic & fairies. An acceptable addition to my collection of the same."
5,Great flic for old & young,"Loved this movie.Thought at first Mia Farrow was the boy's mother!One negative that wasn't explained was Arthur's changed appearance as a Minimoy AND the obvious love interest between him and the princess, voiced by Madonna, which is kinda creepy.But loved all the animation and voice work.Can't wait for sequel!"
4,Mixed ska with latin sounds,"Nice CD, on which ska is mixed with latin sounds. Original sounds with a nice guest: (ex-Hepcat Greg Lee). Mostly instrumental, it will keep you to the roots of jamaican sound."
1,"Very disappointed, doesn't fit the window at all","The window curtain does not fit our window, It is a couple inches too short. The curtain is very thin, even the pattern is pleasant. I'm very disappointed,"
3,Good but not perfect,"I bought this to replace the shower head in my RV. I like the on/off button, actually OFF not trickle, the hose is very flexible and the water coming out of the head very nice. My main complain is the holder, it is a joke, it does not even fit, let alone hold the shower head securely while the RV is moving. I am mad that I have to make a custom holder now. Without the proper holder, it is almost a terrible product."
4,showerhead,This product was easy to install into our RV shower and is great to save on gray water waste. Now our house on wheels is even less stressful on my resident water-use nazi.
5,What he wanted,I ordered this item for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. He inherited a pocket watch that was my Dad's so this is perfect for it. Thank you.
5,Does what I wanted,"I bought this to secure an antique pocket watch until I can find an antique chain to match. This chain is sturdy, connects easily and feels like it will last. For the price you can't beat it."
5,A great dvd for dino lovers,"This dvd has 3 shows in one. The first show has great UPDATED info on a couple dinos. Its great because the show is relatively new so the info is up to date.Shows 3 and 4 are about carnivores that may not be known as much as tyrannosaurus rex, which is really cool and gives you insight on new dinosaurs that you may or may not know"
4,His eyes lit up!,"I purchased this as a Father's Day gift. Dad was delighted just to see the cover photo and very much enjoyed watching the CD. He gives it a 4-star dinosaur rating. Btw, I received it within 3 days of ordering, so I thank the seller for his immediate fulfillment!"
3,Typical Ray Gordon,"This is a typical Ray Gordon bookThe story line is ok if you can stretch incredulity that far. A policeman who is as thick as they come , a drunken chef, a nymphomanic waitress ,a ploice woman who needs warming up and an ice cold ex wife who just needs .If you want a studious read then pass this by but if you want a book which delves into the sex life of a randy, ever hard hotel owner always looking for a quick one then this is the book for you. You can put it down and pick it up at any stage and you will never lose the plot, because there is not much of a plot to lose."
4,Amazing terrain & amazing people,"A facinating read of a little known history. The original explorers of these remote mountains were a motely collection of eccentrics. The author brings these characters to life with a dry sense of humour & an eye for detail as well as thouroughly researched history. It is however the description of this amazing landscape that steals the show. The description of Mt.Nangar Parbat ""the true horror of the Himalays"" with its 26,000 foot sheer cliff face is mind boggling. This is a must read for anyone interested in mountaineering & its history."
2,More of a FAQ than educational,"It's great that there's a book like this out to begin with, but I was disappointed to see the focus only on Windows applications and mostly on how to use existing tools to harden your software. It doesn't really cover as much as I would have liked to have seen on how to actually implement crack-resistant software. Much of the book's contents are FAQ-like and refer only to currently available tools (a very current practical approach versus a broader theoretical academic approach). If the exact problem you're trying to solve is explicitly addressed in this book, you're golden - if not, you're completely out of luck with regards to the book's information."
1,don't learn anything,"i bought this book thinking it will teach me the techniques used in cracking so that i can apply it in my development.well, from that angle this book is a total disappointment. it doesn't even have a section that discusses the basic techniques, zilch!one thing it does tell you is the methods used by various tools but the discussion is too cursory.not worth buying this book. if you want to learn crackproofing or cracking, might as well scour the internet especially learning from the hacker sites.i also wrote to the author. he never replied."
5,Addressing issues specific to shareware programmers,"Crackproof Your Software: The Best Ways To Protect Your Software Against Crackers by software expert and programmer Pavol Cerven is a solid and impressively written guide to a profusion of tips, tricks, and techniques programmers can use to protect their software against hackers, vandals, and unscrupulous crackers who try to take programs apart and figure how they work for the purpose of avoiding paying money to copy, use, or distribute them. Addressing issues specific to shareware programmers, programming for Windows, and much more, Crackproof Your Software is a solid information source which is especially recommended for commercial software programmers and entrepreneurs. An included is an accompanying CD offering dozens of compression and encoding programs, debuggers, anti-debugging tricks, practical demonstrations, as well as sample code from the text."
3,Why must such gorgeous women smoke?,"Former Prince protege Apollonia (born Patricia Kotero on 8-2-59) released this uneven but hardly worthless solo outing in 1988. Similar in style to Sheila E., this pleasant set of dance-pop should satisfy most fans of the genre. Also notable (my personal favorite from the album) is the bubblegum ballad ""Your Eyes."" One major disappointment here is not in the music itself but rather in the album's liner notes, which contain a picture of the sexy, gorgeous woman holding a huge, gross cigarette. Ugh!"
3,It's fun,"The album is fun. If you like good & catchy pop music, this is a good buy. Try e.g. ""Synchronize with the beat"". Unfortunately Apollonia has a weak voice and a song like ""Ay ay ay"" sounds a bit ridiculous."
5,Agua de Cuba,A jacket buys it only in this which is the best. It is the title which Cuban water is good for
5,Perfect!,"Though it's only ADD, the sound is perfectly crisp. The tempi seem right to me. The photo I submitted to Amazon of the back of the CD case art talks about the SBM (Super Bit Mapping) technology. ""The recording on this gold disk has been quantified up to a level of 20 bits,"" whatever THAT means! If you like Dvorak, I strongly recommend this CD."
4,Pretty good sound,I don't know how to explain the previous review. Maybe the disc had some kind of problem. The one I purchased has a very good sound (but probably not the best I have ever heard). Dvorak's 2nd Symphony is not for everyone but if you have the chance to listen to this cd my advice is to give it a try.
1,"Strange, very strange, sound","The label of this CD is called ""Audiophile"" and it proclaims the use of ""Super Bit Mapping"", ""Noise Shaped Dither"" and ""Gold Disc"" tecnhologies. And the booklet informs that this recording was made in 1986.Very well. But how strange this recording sounds! The orchestra - which isn't good either - seems to be playing inside a refrigerator!In a nutshell: avoid this CD."
4,Good adaptation of the anime,"If you've never seen the anime this series might not be for you. There are simply too many references and easter eggs that will go unnoticed or seem pointless. If you have, or if you have a good knowledge of Japanese monster myths, you will enjoy this film.The story is not going to blow you away, but at least it is coherent and something you can follow, which is good for this sort of anime to live action genre. It's also important to note that the TV anime rarely took itself seriously and was a kind of corny, creepy horror anime for kids. That said, I'm certain many adults who grew up on it found guilty pleasure in watching this movie translation.It looks great on blu-ray and a couple of scenes stand out - in particular the flames on the wheels of a train in one scene, a fox spirit's tail hairs, and dad eyeball in a basket on a river.All in all, a colorful, fun movie, but don't expect anything serious -- you'll find the end credits top off the mood of the whole movie...!"
1,"Nice and bendy, but dull and boring","With the advances Transformers have made in play value in the last few years, this toy's a real let down. It can bend. And pose. And bend more. And pose more. That's it. Nice detail, nice articulation. But it's a toy. Someone seems to have forgotten to remind Hasbro that toys are supposed to be fun. It's a nice, bendy paper weight for adult geeks that stick these things on shelves. Not so good as an actual toy."
1,Kind of lame,"This is a flimsy, pretty statuette with several useless, but kewl looking points of articulation.It's not a toy, it's a nostalgia trip for adult fans."
5,A Transformers series for any age!,The Transformers Alternators series is by far my favorite set of transformers. Highly detailed and fun to transform. You will have to convince your friends they are more than just car models!Smokescreen is a particular favorite of mine. He transforms very well and looks great in both forms. He can stand on his own easily and can be posed however you like.I might warn parents that these are not simple toys and any child under 10 may struggle to transform an Alternator.
1,wrong spark plug cables,"To beging with,the bosch spark plugs cables box P/N 09745,was in very bad shape and damaged, also the ends of the cables that is connected to the coil , the cable ends didn't match the size of the ""pins"" of the coil, so I have to fixed the ends of the cables to fit, at the top of that, the size of the cables are short than the originals. I do not recomend whoever is selling this spark plug cables. Maybe the part number match, but not the cables."
2,Maintenance Nightmare,"The printer has a lot of good features, and works well for about 6 months. Then users are faced with a dual nightmare. The high cost of toner and drums has already been mentioned above in several reviews. Complicate your life with the fact that maintenance problems start to accumulate and make the investment in toner and drum replacements more and more doubtful with every day of use. My printer has had 3 separate visits to the depot repair, and since the printer weighs in at over 50 lbs, that's no easy task. It has also had at least 6 calls to Tech Support. Still the problem keeps coming back. Now I will buy a product with built in duplexing, and set the OKI in the rear, as a back up only."
5,A beautiful sight,"As a new crochetter, I was looking for a collection of patterns that would give me many ideas and projects to work on as I increase my skills. So based on the first reviewers' comments, I decided to purchase the Calendar myself. I was not disappointed. This calendar has everything, from the whimsical (Feb 6th, Egg Coaster), to the practical (Feb 18th & 19th, High Stylin' Pillow), to the intricately beautiful (Dec 18th, Snowflake Ornament). The list continues on and on, with scarves and rugs and squares and more, so that I don't know where to start first. Would I recommend this? You bet. I can't wait to see what next year has to offer."
4,Crochet Collection--Excellent; Calendar-- Not so Much,"Got this for Christmas and love the variety of patterns for all skill levels, but cannot use this as a desk calendar due to the inability to write on or record info on the page-a-day sheets without obliterating the patterns.Also, though it is the best of its type I have ever seen, it needs some improvement; patterns should not take up three days worth of pages (better editing of patterns chosen for inclusion might do the trick here) and the photos are not all of professional quality--which they should be at this price, especially so since digital editing software is so advanced these days and publishers presumably have access to even better equipment than we do at home.All in all, I am happy with my gift and will try many of the patterns included, but will not use it as a desk calendar."
4,Woodworking experience is helpful...,"I've had this book for a year and am finally making my first project (How the west was lost). IMHO you need to have some woodworking experience to do the projects other than the very simple ones. Making small parts is difficult on all but a scroll saw or bandsaw with a small blade. Step-by-step specific instructions are scarce. Still, I give this book 4 stars because I really like the projects. I also like being able to come up with my own colors and painting rather than paint by the numbers. I can tell you that the materials that they tell you to use for the mechanical parts are right on. Wire is just too flimsy from my experience. Use a photocopy machine to increase or decrease your pattern sizes. Use spray adhesive to stick the patterns on the wood and you'll get the size you want."
4,Good movie...for Christian and Non-Christians,This is a good video to watch...if you don't want to read the book (but the book is much better...from my what my two sister's told me). Good to watch for Christian and Non-Christian.
4,Enjoyable...,Now that the End Time has passed I wonder what the value of this is. Enjoyable for entertainment though at a good price.
2,Need more information,"I am looking for a play therapy DVD, but there is nothing written on this link that would give me any idea of content. Also, I need a 2 minute clip of it at least to see if this product is what I am looking for. This goes for all DVD's of this type"
1,None,"This book was the most appalling piece of literature I have ever read. Complete garbage, if the author set out to offend then he hit the mark with this tripe. To even call it a novel is an insult to ones IQ. Low brow beyond compare."
3,Family traditions. 3 1/2 stars from me,3 stars is okay. lots gore. okay story line.. Not much else to say. Make you want to carry a weapon everywhere you go
5,WOW!!!!!,"Edward Lee and John Pelan have collaberated on a few books together and each one has been amazing. Family Tradition is a rough,raunchy,sick story.I loved it! Pacific Northwest cannibal rednecks do some unspeakable acts to a group of people who deserve what they get....well some of them do. One redneck is a great cook though! If you are a fan of Lee then you will enjoy this book,if unfamilair with his work then give it a try. True perversity! Dark,twisted,vile,sick mindless violence with a side of dark,twisted,vile,sick sex. A must read for anyone who appreciates stories of the bizzare,unnatural,horrific and grotesque.And who doesn't?"
1,Please DO NOT waste you money,"This was the most pathetic example I have ever seen. I would not use this DVD if it was free. I was completely ripped off! It doesn't deserve one star, but you are forced to select it. Buy a book instead."
2,not what i had hoped for,"in all fairness to Curt, his Van Halen tapes are great. not only does he cover Eddie's licks in detail, he absolutely NAILS his 1978 brown sound. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.this tape unfortunately isn't even close. i bought it out of curiousity hoping for some of the same insight into some of Joe Perry's many different tones, his cool slide stuff and his overall stylesorry Curt, this just seemed low budget and lazy on your part- any begining guitarist can play the Mama Kin riff just by listening to the CD....... you should have given Joe's licks and tones the same respect you gave Ed."
4,Satisfied,"Good quality product, works as advertised. I adapted it to work in a DIY treehouse, and the kids are enjoying it."
4,30 in. x 96 in.,"HomeDepot.com says it is 30 in. x 96 in. Continuous braid net and tubular dowels. Has a 5 year warranty. 150 lb. weight capacity.I have not purchased this product, so the rating I gave it perpetuates the pre-existing average of 4 when I submitted this information."
1,Wouldn't fit our basic playset,"Instructions were horribly insufficient. Unknown how to shorten the length of this net to fit the height of a playset. In any case, the bolts were extremely long and there was nowhere for them to screw into the opening of our playset. Even with a different configuration of our opening, the bolts would stick out so far on the other side of any normal piece of wood that they would certainly have to be cut off to keep from poking or scratching the kids using the set. Our playset is basic and was professionally installed. But, this net kit will not fit into the opening area to allow the use of the cargo net. Had to return it."
3,keynote for Mac os X,"This was a good introduction to Keynote. However, it was written in 2003 and isn't up to date on all the system changes. It's OK as a start, but be aware that it doesn't have the latest word."
2,Laden with typographical errors!,"I do not wish this book upon anyone. It is laden with an extreme, unexcusable amount of typographical errors. The Descartes essay, for instance, contains about four or five misprints on some pages! Especially in a subject such as philosophy, this leads to needless confusion- especially if one isattempting to focus and grasp the essence of the text. Shame on their editors."
1,Indulgent,I was also surprised that this guy put a picture himelf on almost every page. He obviously think he's very interesting.I certainly didn't.
4,Great Finds on This Collection!!!,"This is a must own for any Pentangle fan because of disk 4 which features live material that never appeared on LP. It is fantastic!!! Amazing!!!As an all around collection it has some minor problems. Several songs get repeated performances while other tracks that I feel were great were not included. Reflections is on the 2nd and 4th CD. Sweet Child and Waltz appear twice and we get songs Like Faro Annie and Yarrow from Renborn and Janch's solo albums. I would have rather had songs like ""When I Was in My Prime"", ""The Cherry Tree Carol"", ""Lyke Wake Dirge"", ""A Maid Thats Deep In Love"" and many other great tunes that were left out.This is a great collection with a nice history of the group. Disk 1 and 4 are the best!!!"
3,Good album,"Good album. I feel like if they would have came more mature with this one, and made the music a bit more funky (like on their first album), they would have lasted longer. And promotion definitely would have helped, 'cause it definitely didn't happen on this album. Love the group, and wanted to upgrade my old school tape. Can listen to it time and time again, but still not the 5 star classic I'm sure fans would have hoped it would be.Some definite funky cuts (Where's ya little sista, My First kiss, Throw ya Palms) and one good ballad (Show me the Way, written by members of Boyz II Men). I'd give it 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that. A good album, but not the total package."
3,Coffee Filters,"This product uses #6 paper filters. Of course the product description online does not mention this anywhere. I knew it needed a filter, but I had to wait till the plastic cone arrived before I could read the description on the packaging."
4,stable but slow,"Great little cone. Stable in the carafe and made of pretty solid plastic. Only one issue. drips slowly even when I pull the side out to break the ""vacuum"". Also ordered the Frieling USA Colio porcelain version (the RSVP was going to be put in the camper) but after one use of the Cilio, it will be going back. We found a hairline crack from the top to the bottom after one use.The RSVP is a good cone for the price and makes a good, slow cup of Joe. I challenge anyone to try and beat the price of $9.12!The Cilio cost $24.47. We also found it to be a bit tippy on our stainless carafe.Buy the RSVP. Seriously."
5,Works great,"We had an old one from long ago, but it was unstable in thermos jugs. This one goes in the port, and stands secure. We use it daily."
2,"Works functionally, but tastes like plastic","Functionally, this coffee maker is good and met my expectations. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the brew time reasonable for a great tasting cup of coffee.Unfortunately, that's not what I received. After using the coffee maker three times, I consistently find that the coffee has a plastic flavor to it (not unlike my Cuisinart coffee maker). Despite drinking very dark roasted coffee (Sumatra, Italian and French Roasts) the unwelcome plastic taste comes through.For me, coffee is all about taste. With these results, I'm back to my glass French Press."
1,"Hate to tell you this, but polycarbonate is BPA","Someone wrote in here that this is a polycarbonate product. Polycarbonate is another name for Bisphenol A (BPA). It doesn't just have BPA in it, it is BPA. BPA leaches onto things that it comes in contact with, especially hot liquids. It essentially dissolves. Molecule by molecule, day after day, it ends up in your coffee. BPA gets into living tissue and has biological effects. Though there is some controversy, it is generally considered toxic. Better products are made with polypropylene which is more stable and less controversial."
2,"It works, but so do other things less expensive","Ok...this thing works, but not that well, and definitely not any better than several alternatives.It is nothing but a wide-mouthed funnel with handle. If you compare pricing of normal kitchen funnels to this, you find that it is quite pricey. If you have a 'perfect fit' at the neck with your carafe, chances are, you'll end up with a vapor seal that will prevent it from letting the coffee drip into the carafe, anyhow.I bought one, and while somewhat inexpensive for a 'coffee maker', it is nothing but a glorified funnel. It is a pricey funnel, too. As for taste of coffee, it makes just as good of coffee as you can find a grind for, and get your proportions right.Myself, I still love my Mr. Coffee Coffeemaker 10-to-1 over this thing. After all, what is $0.02 of electricity, anyhow?"
2,wrong size,"The product seems good and I will use it. However, I bought it with a thermos that recommended getting it with a size 4, and they sent me a size 6 item, which looks huge on the small carafe. When you see the 'people who bought this, bought the size 4 filter cone,' you don't automatically get it. I would have preferred the size 4, but don't want to go through the hassle of returning the item."
1,Save your money,"Please do not waste your money on this so called coffee maker. I purchased it to simply fiilter French press coffee into the carafe. It would not even perform this simple task. When I tried another reviewer's tip of lifting the filter to break the vacuum that formed, the filer tore every time--never could get it to work, It goes to Goodwill tomorrow."
2,"Works fine, but badly designed.","Functions fine as a coffee filter...just one problem: It only fits on containers witha VERY narrow mouth. This means that if you want to use a mug or glass, you need to hold the filter until the coffee has drained.poor design."
4,Works as it should.,"It works as it should...The image is a bit deceiving, as it may lead one to believe it comes with a thermos."
5,Perfect for 1-stop coffee lovers,"For those coffee lovers that are a bit slow-going before indulging in that 1st cup of coffee, this coffee-making method is pure, simple and fast. While boiling water in a copper pot (faster!) on the stove., you grind top quality beans & dump them into the #6 melitta filter cone. After throughly steeping the beans with HOT water, you take the thermos to your favorite comfy chair & you do not have to get up until 4 delicious cups of java are lovingly sipped from a china cup while reading the newspaper!! Perfect start of the day!! No endorsement, however, on the quality of the news in the paper!!"
5,The Other Thing This Thing does...,"The other thing this particular filter holder does is to reconstitute frozen juice without making a mess. I use a gallon juice jug (Smaller might be better, but not really a problem.)I put the filter holder into the jug, take the top off the frozen juice and put it upside down into the filter holder. The tube out the bottom of the filter holder is just long enough to make everything stable.I come back in a half hour and the juice is in the bottle, the can is empty, and I use it to add three cans of water.No mess... and no filters required, though they could be used if you were separating spoiled milk to make cheese or something equally ingenious.And if you must make coffee with it then this cup fits it like it was made for it.Thermos E10500 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel MugI use the four cup (i.e. #4) Filters and fill the water to the top of the filter, that's 16 ounces. (Who decided that a cup of coffee is only four ounces?)"
4,Works really well,"It works really well. Of which I'm glad because like others, this is the only product I've found that seems to fill this niche. Hot water from the electric kettle, pour into RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone over pre-heated Nissan bottle, viola! Fresh drip coffee that'll stay hot almost all day.Regarding the technique on getting it to drip properly, I just don't fold the bottom seam of the coffee filter. You can hear the coffee flowing into the bottle and it only takes about two or so minutes to fill a Nissan 26-Ounce Travel Stainless Thermos."
4,More and better coffee,"I needed to make a thermos full of coffee a lot faster than with a #2 filter cone. This did the job and filters out the cholesterol, too. Only problem is that #6 filters are hard to find in my area."
2,Only one small hole to filter coffee through....,"I have the Melitta One cup cone and it has 4 holes for the coffee to drain through. It's wonderful and I use it ALL the time, so I thought this would be a nice way to make a large amount of coffee right into the thermos. Not so. It takes such a L O N G time for the coffee to drip through the cone since there is just the ONE hole. I'm going to get the Melitta Manual 10 cup cone/carafe. You'll never go wrong with Melitta brand.Sorry, but this is a dud.~Jody"
3,A little disappointing,"We bought this manual drip coffee maker for use when camping. While you would think that a manual drip coffee maker would be a simple apparatus where not much could go wrong, in this case there's one fatal flaw. The flange at the bottom of the cone needs to be wider so that it provides more stability on wider mouthed thermoses. This filter borders on scary because all of the weight of the water and coffee are centered over the bottom flange that isn't wide enough to provide a stable base for the coffee maker. It teeters!We gave up on this thing and went back to the one-shot Melitta coffee makers that you can sometimes find on Melitta cans in the grocery--or maybe on Amazon. While they only make one cup at a time, they are well designed and fit well over mugs that are fairly wide."
4,Good Pinion Seal for Dana 30,"I didn't see a down side to using this product. It's just a pinion seal, at a good price from the largest manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket Jeep parts."
4,A good experimental book for neural networks,"This book comes with C++ source code, and thus provides a nice place to begin for someone who is interested in experimenting with neural nets. The author's focus on the character-recognition problem, so the book is somewhat specialized from this perspective. I would not recommed this book to someone who is primarily interested in a strong theoretical book describing learning with neural nets."
3,Now that we've survived!,"This one is just for the fun of it! What did you do the night the millennium ended? This author has some hilarious ideas about what to do & how we did it when the odometer clicked over from 999. If you're religiously sensitive I advise you to give this little book a miss, if on the other hand, you have a lively sense of the absurd, love to have your tongue tied up in exuberant language & take humor literally you will get much irreverent & novel comedy from those burning questions that cropped up. Will the warranty still be valid in 00? A little outdated now as we all know we've survived yet good enough for a laugh or three."
3,"Aww, the ""politically correct"" gimmick has worn thin","Okay, but much less funnier than his others and The Optimist's/Pessimist's Guide to the Millennium"
2,Simply quaint,"Luckily, nothing momentous happened when the year 2000 came to be, and we can now crawl out from under rocks and out of bomb shelters and openly laugh at our now silly-seeming fears. Or maybe it's just James Garner. Aside from a few interesting gags and factoids, the humour of this Y2K spoof is muddled and repetitive. The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile.This book is not for the devout believers. Do notice than in Garner's dictionary, the words ""eschatological"" and ""scathological"" are separated only by a single syllable."
1,What's the joke?,"Garner concludes his analysis of the book of Revelation (in particular) by correlating its vision with the persecution of Christians under Nero. This banal and misdirected exegesis eases his conscience over having to take the myriad of apocalyptic visions of the scriptures (Isaiah 24-27, Jeremiah 30, Psalm 83, Daniel 7-12, Zechariah 12-14, Zephaniah 3, Joel 2, Matthew 24, II Thessalonians 2, etc...) seriously. If you want to mock the scriptures, Mr. Garner, go right ahead. We live in a free country. However, there is no reason to alleviate eschatological tension by revealing that the Bible ""doesn't really teach an imminent Armageddon."" It does, and I don't think any honest invidual could deny it, regardless of the commentaries to be found in his library."
3,Take the Doomsday Final Exam,"The author of Political Correct bedtime Stories this time analyses the world of doomsdayers from religious nuts to asteroid destroying prophesizors. Like the fairy tale books some of the stuff in here is really good and some is rather average. This book was written in 1997 so analysis of the fear of the new millennium is out of date. Anyway, take the Doomsday Final Exam, examine Nostradumuses predictions, learn what to do in case a Jehovah's witness visits. Learn about the crop circles the media did not tell us about, reincarnation and who the antichrist is. Lots of other stuff is in the book too. If you like to poke fun at things then this is the book for you."
3,"or ""Ow, my Karma is killing me!""","Garner has some fun with ""New-Age"" sensibilities and so will the reader. A comic look at some trends that are sometimes so innately amusing it seems to be redundant to make fun of them.Think of it as an issue of The Skeptical Inquirer (with a sense of humor)"
5,Matrox P750,I received everything in the new condition it was advertises as. The product is great excpt for the need to download an aplication so the graphic interface would work. I thought it shoulf have included it on the instalation disk.Other than that eveything works great!
1,There'll always be a McDonald's,"What started out as a great story finished as an agit-prop piece for PETA. The preaching was so banal that I was rooting for the bad guys at the end. Only things missing were the white hats and the black hats so we poor readers wouldn't be confused. Borrow it from the library if you must, but don't waste money on a purchase."
1,written on another planet?,"I am listening to the audio book. The story is quirky and fun, however Liss uses the story to present his radical and outdated beliefs on the treatment of animals in medical research. Had this story been written in the '60s he might have had a point. However, the research labs he describes would land those associated with it in jail for quite a spell today. Which leads me back to my title for this review, did he just return from another planet?"
2,Makes a good point but not well written,"David Liss is one of my favorite authors but his talent remained hidden from the pages of ""The Ethical Assassin."" I agree with Liss's political views so I really wish he was able to pull off the storyline more successfully."
3,Action interleaved with tedious rants,"This review is for the audio version of this book. Wonderfully read with a wide variety of engaging accents, this book immediately pulls the listener in with the amusing and improbable scenario of a door-to-door adolescent salesman in a Florida trailer park. The descriptions are vivid which makes for immediately engaging imagery, but look out as things progress. You will find yourself stuck in the back seat of a car listening to the smugly self-righteous rants of an animal rights activist which, whether or not it's your personal cup of tea, has no business drowning us in the middle of a reasonably good mystery.If you go for it, and I'm not advising you one way or the other, prepare to hit the fast track forward button to make it to the more or less interesting conclusion."
2,Bland with a dash of Self-righteousness,"To preface, I think Liss is a great author and I really loved his first novel,A Conspiracy of Paper: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)was fantastic and completely riveting. I picked up this book in a discount bin, and I understand why it was there.The story isn't entirely uninteresting, but he frequently substitutes a rant for a story. Liss seemed more interested in telling me what he wanted me to think rather than telling me a story. It made the characters completely one dimensional.Ultimately, if you want to read a mishmash of a novel and animal rights propaganda, get this book. If you want a great story with fantastic writing and interesting characters, try one of his other books."
4,An Amusing Tale,"I've been a fan of Liss' novels for some time now. This book is certainly a departure from his work to date (all of which have been historical dramas), and some of the other reviewers correctly point out that this effort could well be mistaken for a Hiassen novel. Regardless, I enjoyed it. If you step back and forget about his earlier works, and evaluate this book as if you were reading a first time author, you can't help but conclude that it is an enjoyable read. Cheers to Liss for trying something different, I can certainly understand an author not wanting to get stereotyped as writing only one particular type of fiction."
3,His other works are much better.,"I'd skip this book and read his other books that are much better. As CR says, there are better choices..."
3,Another Page-turner,"If you like David Liss' other books, you'll like this one. The book definitely has David's writing style all over it. In comparison with his other works, this book drops the F-bomb quite frequently and David really pushes the vegetarian lifestyle and animal rights issues. Parts of the book came across like David was trying to sell you an idea or a way of life. Looking past all that, that book was a good read. Most chapters left you wanting to read on."
3,Not his best,"This wasn't a bad book, but it was far from his best. It was entertaining and humerous as it should have been. It did, however, like some other reviewers said have an agenda about eating meat. No it wasn't in your face, preachy kind of agenda, but it was there and seemed to take a little away from the intent of the book. So overall it's not his best, but it is still entertaining if you don't really take the vegan agenda seriously. It's still worth reading, just don't expect it to be top notch."
5,My Favorite Liss Book Yet,"I've been a big fan of David Liss's historical novels since the 1st Benjamin Weaver mystery was published. I was a bit hesitant when I ordered one set in the 20th century, wondering if Liss could be as effective with a modern setting. I was blown away by how well written the book was. An intelligent and thrilling page turner!"
4,"Good book, but not as good as the Ben Weaver books","I am impressed by Mr. Liss' ability to transcend different times in history and remain an authentic-sounding author. I couldn't help but feel that he gets on a soapbox and expresses some of his own personal views in this book. In the event that some of these views are not Liss's own, then I change my rating to 5 stars and say that he is the master of authenticity."
1,Bait and switch,This book pissed me off. It's a not very thrilling thriller that exists only to be a diatribe about the meat industry. I felt suckered into listening to a sermon. Avoid.
2,An interesting idea defeated by one dimensional characters,"The book is a look at the politics and policy issues raised by the contest over legalized abortion. The author poses one interesting idea, although not new, and several minor ideas. Unfortunately, every character is one-dimensional and all appear to be political cliches from NARAL literature. I would like to see a book that somehow combines the competing virtures and vices in both sides of this controversy. The best I can recommend is a reading of this book with an equally-flawed pro-life novel, such as Deadline by Randy Alcorn. In each, the authors tend to present their side as being more human, with the other a mere cliche."
4,"Interesting read, but plot is impossible and complex.","Pottinger obviously has done his homework before writing this book. I did find the plot to be complex, with many twists and turns. Sometimes too many... As a medical professional, I found many of his references to medical procedure in to be theoretically correct and well explained. Unfortunately, the concept of taking a child to term with-in the body of a man is not very plausible, and innapropriately, highly futuristic. I think that Pottinger might be better served to concentrate solely on fiction with its basis primarily on what he knows best, the law. His altitudnous insight (as I'm sure he possesses, having argued before the supreme court) would definitely contribute to an excellent legal thriller. But by enlarge, this book was good for his first effort. I commend him."
3,A Mystery and an Ethical Dilema,"This book definitely made me think. Fundamentally the book focuses on the lives of a Supreme Court judge, and an attorney, both male, on opposing sides of the abortion debate. The mystery throughout the book focuses on the deaths of several women who seem to have bled to death during or shortly after what appear to have been emergency hysterectomies. In addition there is a slight focus on the attorney and his relationship with his long time girlfriend. The romance and the mystery alone were quite intriguing to me. However the ethical question is what sticks with me despite having read this book three years ago. All I can say without revealing too much is, the book ends up placing the two men in the position of feeling sympathy for the other side's view, in a personal, somewhat suprising way."
1,A Propoganda Piece of Monstrous Proportions,"After expecting a Michael Crichton, Robin Cook, or Jonathan Kellerman-style thriller, I was quite disappointed. The book was well-written enough to compell me to finish it, despite how angry it made me (hence the rating of 2 instead of 1). I am a strong believer in life, but I can accept it when people have a pro-choice viewpoint. It's when it is ""in my face"" that it makes me livid. This book, although fairly well-written, was not so much a medical thriller but rather an elaborate pro-choice propaganda brochure with a cast of paper-thin characatures and bad stereotypes representing the pro-life side of the argument. Mr. Pottinger could have saved a lot of time and effort if he skipped the novel and merely stated his intended point more directly: "" Pro-life is bad. Pro-choice is good."" Some of us read to be entertained, not lectured to."
4,Medicine and politics collide in this intricate thriller...,"Harvard-educated lawyer Stanley Pottinger's debut novel starts out unrelenting, and pretty much stays on that level throughout. A merciless prologue sets the tone, then the reader is whipped into a bizarre series of murders which ultimately connect themselves to some of the highest political and judicial offices in the land. The characters are sexy and interesting, the plot twists flirt with implausibility yet don't quite consummate same, and things are resolved in a curiously ambiguous fashion. Preachy, to a slight degree (hence the missing 5th star), but Pottinger's (what's next, Stanley?) novel rips at you and defies you to put it down."
4,A Great Book,"I read this book about 4 years ago, when my mom's boss gave her a bag full of books, some were cheesy, trashy romance novels but one in particular grabbed my interest from the others. It was The Fourth Procedure by Stanley Pottinger and I began reading it and finished it in about 2 days. Any reader who has a modicum of intellect will find this novel a breezy, fun and hyper creative read. I couldn't put it down and the ending blew me away. And still to this day I think that its possible and what occured in the book could happen in real life. Some of the topics covered were kinda testy at best as with anything involving abortion, politicians, secret medical experiments which tamper with the natural law among other controversial aspects but this book manages to blend them all in a steamy potboiler worthy of praise and at least a movie of the week if not a full length feature if you ask me."
1,Brain Dead Political Screed,"First, I agree with just about all of Mr. Pottinger's agenda. Being pro-choice is good, boming abortion clinics is bad. Not as bad, however, as his writing, which would be perfectly adequate for a comic book, but is otherwise painfully inept. The premise and plot of this worthless little book are sooo idiotic I had to groan upon figuring things out. And putting it all in the Washington DC scene is unforgivable. This thing is liquid filth. Stay away."
1,Re-do,Same book was written under another title - can't find it but left me bummed after first two chapters seemed all too familiar
2,Let down,Starts beautifully and the prose remains brilliant throughout.However somewhere along the line the author seems unsure whether he is writing a medical/legal/crime or science fiction novel. The characters have little flesh and blood and evoke little deep emotion. The events fit together too smugly and the conversations are often awkward. And the pseudoscience spoils it all. Forced male pregnancy to make men rethink their views on abortion? A long shot and unfortunately one that fails badly.
2,Amazon Read,"I did not like the novel in the beginning, but then later on the book gets more interesting. This book is an abortion fiction book It is about many medical rblems which als create political problem, so it is mixed. If you like books that talks about abortion and medical issues, this is the book is that the book can also like mstry books, well, you have found it. What I like about the book is that the book can relate to real life even though this novel is fiction. It is outstanding, but once again I won't say it was the best book I have ever read in my life. This is a book that has mystery throughout the whole story about many women who are dead or are dead or are bleeding to death. This book has lots of suspense.If you ask me about recommending it I would say not to read it bu then again there are many people who like certain types of books. If you like to follow through stories, this book can be a little challenging"
3,the ending was foolish,The ending was foolish. I liked the book until maybe the last four chapeters then the book just went down hill. I will not spoil the ending for anyone but come on how can you write a terrific first 3/4ths of a book and then fall flat on your face. I started reading the book in highschool then graduated and lost track of the book but when I found the book again I remembered every detail and was thristing to finsh the book but when I did I wish I hadn't. I should have keep the mystery a mystery.
3,Pro and Cons,Pottinger takes us into the steamy political and religious debate of abortion verses antiabortion and people's individual rights against the rules of government and churches. All the pros and cons are brought out in a mystery plot of life and death on all levels.The author incorporates quite a few twists and turns as well as some off the wall surprises. Many of the sub-plots keeps your head spinning. Combining the medical world with the legal world and adding a dash of politcal seasoning and you've got quite a story.
3,"Pretty Plates, Poorly packaged","Received this item this morning. The quality of the dinnerware is good and it has a lovely pattern. Unfortunately the packaging is not really designed for individual shipment to the consumer, and a handful of the 53 pieces where completely shattered. Surprisingly, the dishes were either completely intact or completely destroyed with no hope of use. Nothing contained minor chips/dings.The product itself is actually Sakura Basketweave Set; Oneida is the parent company but i was unable to find replacement pieces at the official Oneida online store as the pattern is not listed.Rated 3 stars due to the fact that the Amazon customer service staff was extremely helpful when i spoke to them and i can expect a new set of dishes on Tuesday, just in time for Thanksgiving."
2,only for nimble fingered mechanics.,"I found the clasp exceedingly complex and difficult to close. I would recommend this only to those who have extraordinary vision, dexterity, and a high degree of mechanical smarts.To make things worse, there are no instructions with the watch and the clasp is of a type I've never seen before."
1,Unsatisfactory,"This DVD is only 22 minutes long. It is the same song, ""Strange Condition"", done 3 times, followed by a ""Behind The Scenes"". I received the DVD yesterday and if I had known what was actually on the DVD I would not have ordered it."
2,Not as expected,This piece appears better crafted in the image than it actually is. It is poor quality sterling at best. The details are rounded and not cleanly etched. For the price I expected much better in such a small piece. I do enjoy the design but wear it more often as a lapel pin than a pendant. Service was speedy but don't get this item if you want fine detail.
3,So So,I love the design and the detail is much better than other review gave it. My problem is with the clasp. It broke after only a month of wearing it.
3,Solid Book Stand - Sensitive Swivel,The book stand is solid and well built. My only complaint is the swivel device which allows the stand to swing is way to sensentive - therefore unless the shelf or other area you place the stand is exactly level the stand will not allow the book to faces you - it will shift left or right on its own and that can be very annoying.
4,quality merchandise,The book stand is a good size to hold a 'tabletop book' that you want to display - we are using it in a new bookcase/cabinet combo. It swivels very easily and is quite solid.
3,Light weight but held our albums.,We used these to hold wedding albums at bridal shows. One swiveled a little to much but they did the job.
3,It's OK,"For the price paid, this product was disappointing. I could have bought the materials and made it for far less! It feels like pressboard, and not very solid. It works fine, but just didn't meet my expectations for the price paid. But what does these days?"
2,Good Concept bad Execution,"Hartz At Play.I bought this at the store for my 8 month old Pomeranian and within an hour he was able to pull the rope right out of it's head.there was stuffing everywhere!not to mention the little felt ties didn't hold up.he was able to chew them off and untie them quite quickly.Good concept but I guess they should of sewn tighter seams and maybe used something a little more durable than felt.My dog loved it, but he loved it a little too much.for the price I've gotten much more durable toys."
2,"Poorly Written, but Fact Filled","Lowell Dittmer was also my professor. The only thing saving his dense lectures is the fact that he actually gets some information out. The book is strikingly similar because of Dittmer's convoluted sentences, overused abbreviations, and lack of real flow... Despite this, the text covers a great deal of information for those intensely interested in this area of study. If you can get through the book, you might learn a lot. And no, I'm not bitter, I got a good grade in the class :)"

2,colorful,"A short pamphlet. Although colorful, much of the information can be retrieved on the websites for Maui without cost."
5,Great Knife,"This is a great knife. I love the handle b/c its no-slip, but easy on your hands. My only con is the knife is not razor sharp out of the box, but it can be easily fixed with a good sharpening. So, IMHO, that is not worth taking away a star. Overall, a great, reliable knife."
5,Great Knife - Ka Bar is the BEST,"Can't go wrong when purchasing a Ka Bar. This knife is awesome, well built and high quality. I got this for my husband as a gift and he loved it. I also own a Ka Bar myself and by far these are the best knifes out there."
4,absolutely amazing,"The knife is absolutely amazing, lives up to every expectation i had before receiving my order. Upon opening knife was sharp as a razor, gave myself a nice little shave. passed the paper and bottle cutting tests with flying color. Planning on testing blade further tomorrow with wood processing. only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is because amazon screwed up the first time around. paid for one day shipping, had to contact fedex and was told order cannot be fulfilled due to box being empty.. smh. amazon resent order for no charge, but received order 4 days later that what was expected and had to cancel some plans because i did not have all my equipment due to shipping issues. sheath is a nice touch, love the leather smell, a little stiff but all you need to do is work it in like any other leather item. Besides the shipping i am so pleased with the knife that i plan on buying an additional kabar. i strongly recommend this knife to anyone looking for a solid buy."
3,good not perfect,"When I first bought the Ka-Bar I thought it was amazing. Thick blade, nice length blade, nice bowie shape, and the black finish looks amazing. But it has its flaws the serrations came very sharp but the rest of the blade wasnt very sharp. After looking at it and testing it out a bit it seemed perfect, but another flaw is the tip around the 4TH day of having the knife the tip broke off. Looking past the the lack of tip strength it is a good knife."
1,Factory Second!,"The item is obviously a factory second - I did not know Amazon promoted factory seconds...If you are reading this you might want to reconsider buying the same item from this seller and through Amazon.This is the first time Amazon and one of its sellers have apparently substituted a first-line product for a factory second, but, who knows if it will be the last."
5,Sharp.,"I got this knife because my friend gave me the money and i ordered it for him, so upon it being on the doorstep, he runs inside, opens it, and pulls it out while still sheathed. i quickly snatch it from him and feel the sharpness. Upon reaching the serrated edge i said ""hey this serrated edge isn't even sharp"" as i was rubbing my fingers up and down the serrated blade. In a few second, needless to say i feel and hear a big ""SHHUTT"" from my hand and theres blood all over my cut finger i quickly grab a paper towel and wipe up the blood and grab a couple band aids (except i used masking tape)"
4,Good knife but...,"After reading the reviews and on the reputation of Ka-Bar I decided to pick up this knife. I found it to be a good fit for my hands - S/M. My problem is with the factory sharpening. To me, a blade is sharp when it cuts through a sheet of paper that I'm holding in the air. Out of the box, this one fails. I'll spend some time sharpening and it should be good to go."
5,I need new sheets...,"I bought this knife thinking it was going to be good. It was. The serrations don't look to sharp and are round, but I assure you, they are. I actually managed to scrape my fingerprints off with them.When I first got it, I was unwrapping it on my bed. Once I got it out I proceeded to start playing with the knife, spinning it, and tossing it around, obviously not the smartest practice. Then once I mishandled it and it fell down onto my bed, tip first. It sliced right down to the springs of my mattress. Don't play with sharp objects kiddies!"
3,Mean looking,This knife looks intimidating and mean. But right out of the package it wouldn't harm a fly. Needed some major sharpening. That's the price of getting a knife online but it is easily fixed. On the whole its impressive...worth the money...cheaper than anywhere else and I shopped around
3,Very good knife,This knife is one of the best knives I have ever purchased! It comes very sharp and its a really hard blade. But the only downside is that it dulls quickly.
3,"Love the variety, but there's a flaw in the design","My 2.5 year old is just getting into puzzles, and I thought this would be a good one. I like the variety of animals included (everything from goat to seal to dog to cat... it's all there!). We don't use all the animals at once, it would be too overwhelming. The only flaw is that every piece fits every other piece. In other words, Mama Bear fits with Baby Ducks. Not so useful when trying to encourage learning animals, matching, etc.If the pieces only fit their partner, then this would be a 5star. As is, I'm giving it 3. It's still fun, it's just doesn't serve to teach matching."
4,Instant interest from 16 month-old,"I gave this puzzle to my 16 month-old nephew for Christmas, and although he didn't quite understand the concept of puzzles or baby/mother animals, he enjoyed pulling the pieces apart."
1,"Hood was alread included with the lens, so I got a spare hood (for what is worth)","I bought this hood the same time I bought ""Sony 50mm f/1.4 Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera"" through Amazon. However, the description of the lens didn't include the information that the hood was included in the package.Hence, I've got myself a spare hood, which is as useless as ice cube to a eskimo."
2,brass-like resin plant stand,"I already reviewed this product. However, to repeat, the plant stand arrived with a piece broken off. In my opinion, it also did not look as pictured. I contacted Amazon and Reorient. Reorient was responsive to my concerns, stating each stand was made by hand and the broken piece must have occurred during shipping. Jason, from Reorient, spoke to me on the phone. He said he would personally check other stands in stock and compare them to the picture. If he could find one that looked more like the picture, he would send a new one. If not, he would credit my account. Apparently none of the stands in their warehouse looked as pictured and I received a credit to my account. I was impressed with the company's handling of my situation, but was disappointed the plant stand was not what I expected."
1,buyer beware!,"Watch band was way too large & non-adjustable (according to email reply from the manufacturer). Emails to the manufacturer finally admitted that the goal was to sell the remainder of the watches with the largest band (which nobody wants), and to disguise that fact. Email replies from the manufacturer had the wording ""sorry for the inconvenience"". Inconvenience???!!! What good is a watch that ends up on the underside of your wrist because the band is way too large??"
5,If you like sour- this is PERFECT!,"I grew up loving pop rocks, and now that I'm in college we have stores on campus that sell these and I cannot get enough! They're super sour and pop just like always- it's perfection!"
3,Pop Rocks only fun in moderation...,"If your planning on ordering the bucket thinking your gonna eat it up yourself. Think again. After like the fourth one they lose their appeal (but not their flavor). The point is that if your planning on buying it, you should either plan on giving it away or selling it."
1,Buy a different flavor!!,These pop rocks are XXXXtremely sour. I gave them for trick or treat candy. They are so sour we could not get any children to eat the whole pack. They threw their extra packs away. I still have half the container left and none of my children nor the neighborhood children want to eat them.
4,Just what I expected,"Ordered on a Tue, arrived Thu morning! Easy to assemble, can hold multiple items and doesn't look like it will tip over when fully loaded. Only issue I had with it was that there were a few places on one of the upright pieces where the wood grain/finish looked ""spotted"". But since the hanging coats hide it, it doesn't affect the integrity of the coat tree."
5,Great Mugshot/Technical Book,This book is an ideal reference for gardening professionals or those home gardeners who have fallen in love with the broad range of heucheras and heucherellas that have become available. It would be an ideal addition to a community library as well. The many pages of color photos of the different cultivars are like having a catalog for plant shopping. The cultivation instructions are good and the enthusiasm of the author for his subject shines through.
4,The Authors were first,"This is a good book, particularly because when it came out, it was the first, and these authors are committed to advancing heucheras in the garden. I am biased, as I crave anything on the subject. I would have given it a higher star, but will wait until I have read the other book on the subject. It has nice photos of heuchera at their very best, and good descriptions of the varieties, and great tips on propagation--which I have used successfully! Buy the book and propagate your heuchs in the spring. I hope this is helpful, but if you like heucheras, you'll buy the book irrespective of what I've shared."
2,mmmmfffffff!,"the title ""condomblack "" suggest that you are gonna find candomble music here , or at least something afro-brazilian , mixed with pop or something .This CD is a dissapointament .Nothings happen here . A mediocre singer singing mediocre songs .I can't understand ."
1,Curiousity value only,"I made a stupid mistake and bought this thinking it was the comedy movie ""Student Bodies"" with some extras. I don't know what I was thinking. At any rate, I had no interest in what I received at all. It appears to be some very old ""teaser"" movies. Quality was poor, but perhaps the original media was not high quality to begin with. The only value in this for me was seeing the very early work of some of today's superstars. Other than that, it will probably just end up in the trash for me. Others might find these old movies interesting, though."
1,Pricing is too high!!!!!,Loved this series as a young girl. Would love to enjoy it again. But the price for the set is much more than I would pay for just a 2 series set.Come way down in price people.
4,Does the trick,The item works as advertised and am pleased. Only complaint is the excessive freight charge for a tiny item. I used this to join my RV backup camera lead with my tow vehicle monitor lead.
5,A Trip to the Throne!,"I first bought this book in 1968 (when I was YOUNG!). I came upon it up again last week and got reacquainted. What a treasure! HOW could I have neglected it all these years? This is truly a rich daily devotional. Each presentation has a day's worth of spiritual ""meat"" to chew on! Dry? - NEVER! It is interspersed with beautiful poetry, enhancing the text. You will not be disappointed."
5,The Ideal Devotional for Any Era,"A lot of today's devotionals are geared toward the selfism of our culture and invite you to discover or become a better person with purpose. Yet, Baxter invites you to become a better Christian through a full year of powerful but concise devotions that really are daily Bible studies. That was exactly what I felt led to when I was seeking a devotional to become the basis of my personal study and daily meditations. Even though it is over ten years old, it is still extremely relevant to our modern era and it is intriguing to place Baxter's words into the contemporary perspective following the events of the least several years in our culture. It's no wonder why so many have been sold and continue to sell. It's the perfect self or group study for any era."
5,Awake My Heart,This is a supurb daily devotional. Baxter's solid theology and warm style of writing blend perfectly. This is a truely inspirational book writtin by a man who obviously had a deep personal relationship with his Savior. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
5,Tremendous devotional,J. Sidlow Baxter is a man blessed with insight that only God can give for his words cut to the very heart as only God's words can. Awake My Heart is quite possibly the best devotional I have ever read and I have read through a few. I will now seek to get his Explore the book texts to further my reading. Great for the beginning or seasoned Christian.
5,Awake My Heart by JS Baxter,"I was very pleased with the promptness in which this order was dealt, and everything was to my total satisfaction. Thank you so much. Lois Wise"
2,where's the beef?,"i thought this book was an ok start for someone who has not had the opportunity to reflect on how their feelings are a direct result of dealing with a parent of manic depression. however, i was dissappointed that the author did not get into more depth about how she specifically achieved her newfound ability to cope with her mother's illness, especially since she endured abuse. she goes from one extreme to the other-from abuse to a great understanding and acceptance of her mother. this does not seem very realistic to me. what happened in between? how did she get there? that's the meat that could be very helpful. i think that for most people, the illness gets worse with time and it becomes increasingly challenging to deal with the family member. it takes great inner stength and endurance to deal with it especially if you are the only person around to help out."
3,Interesting,"This is probably the 1st book I have read hoping to find something I could relate to. I have to admit, it seems as though every case is drastically different--someone might consider my life to be horrific--yet it comes no where close to some of the examples provided within this book--it seems their cases might be excessive or extreme compared to mine so I found it harder to relate to. There are some similarities but not too many--a few line items here and there where I was like 'yup--that's me' but not too many of those. It would have been nice to see a broader range of real-life interviews/examples then the few used. Overall this book left me desiring more. Not the worse book by any means but worth a read through."
2,Tiny Print,Haven't been able to really get into it because the print is so tiny and compacted. The writing is difficult to read. It seems to be biased favoring the English side.
5,Very pleased!,"This is a wonderful Christmas CD. I bought it to replace the one I bought years ago and had worn out. Patti's rendition of ""O Holy Night"" is fantastic; her voice terrifically powerful and emotive. The orchestral pieces are well done but Sandy Patti dominates the disc with a very satisfying performance. I was happy with the quality of the CD and the prompt delivery also."
2,cd player doesn't work,"the display is awesome, and i love the aux in, but the cd player is a piece of crap. it hasn't worked since day one."
4,If only one lie,"I say lots of people have strong views of this book. It seems if you believe in evolution you say 1 star and rip the author up and down.I say four stars becuase if Wells even exposed 1 lie (which I say he may have) weather it be for or against evolution Good job! Textbooks in schools need to be and must be teaching ONLY the truth weather for or against peoples beliefs.Evolution and I.D. are both a belief ""theory"" there is no empirical evidence either way. but to find the truth we must show all truth regardless of our belief systems and expose all lies regardless of our belief system.Stick to the truth and only the truth don't speak lies to get your way! If your belief is true then it will win in the end with no help from making up lies to ty to prove it! Speaking lies of your belief will only prolong the win."
5,Essential,This book is essential for any scientist who accepts dogma without examining the evidence firsthand. I thought he handled the peppered moths and Darwin's finches especially well.
1,Evolution is fact,"I would just like to let everyone know that evolution has been observed in nature & in a labratory within my lifetime (yes that goes for ""macro"" evolution too) & there are many many examples of transitional fossils that have been unearthed. scientists have even recently found that they can radically alter animals such as fruit flies by altering ONE gene, debunking the creationist argument that simultanious gene alterations are both neccessary to evolution & mathematically implausable. considering that genes are altered all of the time & genetic mutation is in no way challenged, i'm wondering what would stop evolution. What more evidence could you expect? do you want an ape to give birth to a human? You can lead a man to reason but you can't make him think."
5,New View,I was surprised to read the mass of evidence showing the questionable character of many of the main arguments for evolution. We need challenges like this book presents. Most of the material is well-documented. I consider the anthropology chapter to be perhaps the weakest although it does present some valuable insights. The author certainly is well qualified with a Ph.D in religion from Yale and another in molecular biology from Berkeley.
1,Author appears to have religious ax to grind,"Author repeats a common Christian-oriented set of statements about scientific conclusions about the fossil record, radionuclide dating, and forces a faulty biological processes to discount a mountain of scientific studies that show from every branch of science (nuclear, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, genetics, astrophysics, anthropology, zoology)that environmental conditions and mutation causes shifts in the allele frequencies and associated traits found in the population of all species. This author distorts and misrepresents the science and leave most science out of his predisposed conclusions. It is a tragic use of the written word. I would only recommend this book to those afraid of reality."
3,Misrepresentations of Evolution,"Jonathan Wells provides readers with a clear, concise and effective summation of the faults in major textbook examples of evolution. His writing is fluid and easy to follow. But while he writes on the misrepresentations of the Icons, he makes a few of his own. He supports many of points with short quotes from scientific journals, but construes the overall points of them. Just be careful not to assume all of his interpretations are 100% true without following up on them. But aside from these misquotes Icons is a terrific read. It's exceptionally organized and breaks through the exaggerations of the long standing Icons. From Haeckel to finches, Wells offers a fair (if sometimes inaccurate) representation of the side not shown in textbooks."
5,Astonishing and well supported,"I highly recommend this book, its up to date, well documented, and truely shocking if you, like most people, assumed evolution is all-but-proven. My 3 year old collegiate biology text had nearly all of the ""proofs"" of evolution Well's mentioned and presented all of them without controversey and without counter argument. Wells does a meticulous job of showing their fallacies and even academic fraud by evolution's most theological proponants. This book is a must read and should be a wake up whistle to the scientific establishment."
4,Well written. Evidential.,"I've read some reviews of this book, some websites dedicated to decrying it. They don't really offer evidence to the contrary, they just accuse the author.I think he does a good job of explaining the controversy (Icon) and what the undisclosed evidence (or really lack of evidence) is.I was dissappointed that he didn't go more into the hominid fossil record, but the volume of evidence against hominid evolution would generate a couple more books.The fact is that the strict evolutionist is by nature not scientific because they won't allow discussion of the topic, they just belittle those who question. Isn't questioning the gateway to scientific discovery?I think Wells does a good job of giving us enough of the issue and the hidden side while keeping the book portable."
1,Wells tries hard,"Jonathan Wells goal is clear. He attempts to debunk evolution by pointing out textbook errors; however, one does not overturn science by pointing out publishing errors. The proper way to go about arguing against a well-established paradigm is in the scientific literature. Wells is strangely silent in the scientific venue and one can only assume that he hopes to overcome real science by appealing to the masses through the use of 'spin' rhetoric. Wells contribution will no doubt find favor among his ye-creationist brethren, but he offers little in the way of useful scientific argument. Apparently, he thinks that pointing out errors in High school and college textbooks is the same thing as basic research. This book is of little use in promoting ye-creationism or refuting his Quixotic nemesis."
1,The school system is not authoring evolutionary theory...,"While I am overjoyed that somebody is exposing some of the incredibly stupid notions that have filtered down to the school systems from the scientific community, I am depressed that his focus is on all of these SECONDARY sources!It is in effect an argument against the copyists, not against the scientists themselves, who are in no way the source or defenders of such claims. It is akin to waging a war by focusing entirely on media misconceptions - never sending an actual troop to the front lines.Let's focus on what the Evolutionists are saying - not the poorly educated and uniformed school teachers, whom have nothing to do with the formation of current evolutionary theory."
2,Finally. . . !,"As a graduate of the University of Utah, whose professors shoved Evolution down our throats, it is refreshing to see that there are actually scientists that know that evolution is an extremely flawed theory. The book presents its material in an easy to read, logical, non-jargon-istic way.It is frightening to know that my children are using the very books that Dr. Wells cites."
1,Icons of Evolution -or- Textbooks are Mediocre,"Wells does little more than prove that biology textbooks are generally mediocre, outdated, and rife with errors. What else is new? He completely fails to discredit evolution, and considering his Moonie background, his motivations for writing the book are highly suspect."
1,Unique phenomenon - American exceptionalism,"In most other developed countries, we will not see these many positive reviews of this book. Very unique, American, phenomenon.Supernatural being - God - created the world. All the stories in Bible has to be true, although most of them need constantly to be clarified (re-interpreted) in order to fit in the picture of ever-changing new scientific discoveries. Period."
1,Think before you buy,"I was given this book to read because I am a true believer in the Evolution THEORY. I read with an open mind and came to this conclusion: This book is nothing but a fraud that is trying to spread the power of the Unification Church. Talk about biased! If you have scientific questions regarding evolution theory that you want answered, I would think twice about reading the words from a draft-dodging cultist."
3,It's good enough,"All those reviews whom quote this book as a bad and of 'poor' science are obviously from evolutionists who are very naive and stupid. What Wells did is a very good job. Evolutionists will never listen to any rational evidence against their precious theory, which is still alive today, not because it is true, but rather because some scientists desperatly want it to be. Just take your pick but it is not valid to conclude that a book is of poor science when it goes against the neo-darwin theory. It's the theory itself that is based on pseudo-science."
3,Chipping away at decades of misinformation,"Wells provides a revealing and precise dismantling of some common evolutionist chestnuts- many of which are still used by them in debates or placed in textbooks. The sort of red herrings that the present generation was taught to swallow as children in biology class.He does not, however, go into any depth, or make any conclusions as regards the wider creation-evolution debate.Evolutionists will say my review is ""Not helpful"" even if they haven't read the bookCreationists will say my review is ""helpful"""
1,Pure politics,"Unfortunately, Mr. Wells received instruction to ""destroy Darwinism"" by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, the well-known billionaire right-wing leader of the unification church. Only then did Mr. Wells enter academia and receive his Ph.D. in biology, just to be able to claim ""legitimacy"" in attacking evolutionary thought. In recent interviews, Mr. Wells has been quoted as suggesting that America needs to be cleansed of evolutionists as it has been cleansed of communists in the past. It's too bad Mr. Wells has to inject politics into science. Scientific research is based on objectivity, and the fossil record is not a ""Democrat"" or ""Republican."" Unfortunately for Mr. Wells, the fossil record shows spectacular examples of intermediate forms in horses, whales, and, yes, humans. Mr. Wells will sound very convincing to the lay person, but may I suggest the casual reader do a bit of research on the subject before coming to hasty conclusions."
1,Er...back to the evidential world please,"The thought that people actually take this book seriously makes me think of a joke regarding Bush's recent popularity poll wherein over 60% do not approve of Bush as President, and the 34% that approve of Bush also believe that Adam and Eve rode a Dinosaur to work (at least that is what Well's cronie, Ken Ham, is trying to teach at his museum in Kentucky).This book is a must read for you 34%!Even [Baptist U] Baylor University kicked out Dembski when they realized that I.D. would only make their University the laughing stock of Academia......"
1,against reason,if evolution is possible in the lab how we exclude the possibility of its occurence in the cosmic lab of nature? the attractive style is a threat.i wonder that all revies were positive.we need more science literacy worldwide to save our future from attractive nonesense.
1,one derful boook,"Wells boook iz good. Soo glad to ssee other freinds like me here who lik wells and who scared of evolutshcion like me. Mr Wells scared tooo. Like my freinds here i think educsation iz bad. Too much complicdtion makes brain huurt, my freinds who lik Wells brians hurt too.Stopp hurting brain! Make thinkn easy!Wells make things easy four us. comfort us from ffear and coplicated tinking.Im glad i fownd so many freinds here who think like mme. With Wells help well show those stoopid intiLECT-youalls that you can be smaert without science.Im afread of flying too. I hope Wellls will write boook that shows flyying is bad and doesnt egxist either. Flyingg shuld go away too."
1,It's a joke people,"I picked this book up thinking it was a science book about evolution. No way! It's a completely bogus piece of charlatan poop serving no purpose but to seperate a sucker from his money. The scientific arguments he makes are completly fabricated bits of fiction from cover to cover. If you want to read the real truth about evolution, then try either the Blind Watchmaker or the Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins."
1,THIS IS A CREATIONIST TEXT,"For those of you who are considering reading this book, be warned that it is NOT based on science. It is written by a cleverly-clothed creationist. Look into his background and judge for yourself."
1,A sad commentary to the public,"I can't believe anyone takes Well's tripe seriously.I mean it doesn't take a biologist to figure out that this book is utter garbage.Evolution is a fact. Please come to the 21st century, we have pie here...No need to live in the dark ages."
1,One Good Book on Science...,If you read only one good book on science this year it won't be this one.Icons is written by Jonathan Wells whose only real job appears to be with a Public Relations company in Seattle that is promoting Intelligent Design and is a waste of anyone's hard earned money.I will never again read a book from an author with a Ph.D that does not have a Jo.BAnd I don't expect the DVD/video to be any better.
3,Not much new.,"This book was well written, but sometimes overly analytical, as in ""kicking the dead horse"" by repeating itself over and over again. Also, I found a better synopsis of the arguments in Lee Strobel's The Case for a Creator. This book did not add much to the analysis, and often left many questions unanswered. Although I find the information contained in the book interesting, I feel it could have gone a bit further to try to tie up loose ends. All in all, this is a great introductory book to the problems with evolution, and I recommend to anyone interested in pursing this line of inquiry."
4,Eye opening assessment of the evidence for evolution,"The author does a convincing job of presenting reasons for both scientists and the general public to revisit what has been assumed to be evidence regarding so called ""macro""-evolutionary theory. In light of the statements and the research of materialistic evolutionists themselves, he shows good cause to reexamine the foundations of evolutionary teaching presented in current high school and college/university textbooks which contain outdated and inaccurate misrepresentations of the actual available scientific data. Worth the read, and easy to comprehend for the average person."
5,Find Out for Yourself,"Regardless of your preconceived ideas, this book will be an eye-opener. Wells does an incredible job of making this topic thorough, readable, and fascinating. Whatever side you are on, evolution, creation, or intelligent design, this book will enhance your knowledge of the issue. This book is well-researched, well-written, and hard to put down. I found the attacks on this book rather amusing, as if the reviewers were desperate to put down Wells and attempt to keep people from reading this book. Don't fall for it---find out for yourself. I am a science teacher, and am in no way connected with the Discovery Institute."
1,C'mon ...,"What a silly book this is. You simply cannot critisize a scientific theory only by judging high school texts about it. What is said here about evolutionary theory could just as well be said about astronomy or geology. Of course issues are simplified in high school text books, since understanding the theories thoroughly would require years of dedicated study.In short: the purpose of this book eludes me. That errors and simplifications in public presentations of evolution theory would diminish it is nothing but a straw man argument... and a very transparant one too. Someone must already heavily dislike that theory already to fall for it (...)"
4,Unique,"This is the 4th Recluse book I have read. The story centers around young Creslin, a storm wizard. The story is broken down across 3 stages of young Creslin's life, Blade Master, Storm Master and Order Master. As usual the pacing is slow and purposely deliberate but none the less told by a master storyteller. Modesitt's characters are some of the strongest characters that I have read to date. They are strongly developed and the reader usually finds something within each character to bind with, thus you care about Creslin and you want to see him succeed. There is also a very serious love story here, also very strongly developed and loaded with conflict. The love story made the book memorable in my eyes as it opened not only Creslin's eyes but mine. These are the qualities that make Modesitt the writer he is. He writes of fiction and fantasy but in all his books the reader comes away with an underlying real world message."
4,Nice change from the traditional fantasy style,"I must admit, when i picked up this book, I thought it was going to be another Tolkien rip-off like so many books are now, but i was pleasantly surprised. I've not read the first book in this series, but i don't think the book lost anything with this. At a glance, it is a strange style that the author has used, deciding to write in the present tense, but is effective when you get the hang of it. The lack of deep themes and morals is made up for by some fantastic scenes and original ideas. The start does drag on, however, and the annoyingly-happy ending is a bit predictable. The poetry and songs in the book are quite good though, if you read them."
2,Blah,"I guess I just can't get into this ""series"" after reading Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, and others. My idea of a series follows one or a couple main characters throughout the entire story. Recluce books do not!! They are confusing to read. Things happen inthe story and you have no idea how they happened. I have read the first and second books of this series and will most likely not read any more."
3,Here we go again.,"This book really just mirrors the story in the first book. Young lad ventures out into the world, learns how to control and use his powers, and confronts the enemy in the last chapter.Even worse this book is a prequel to the first book, so unless you've read the first book recently, you're likely to be a little lost in the beginning. Although the story is mostly self-contained.Towers of the Sunset still uses the really good background of Order vs Chaos introduced in the first book, but it just tells the same story again."
4,Quite good,"Modesitt had a purpose for this book -- he wanted to explain how and why Recluce was settled, and why the black magicians keep the politics they do. This gives the book more substance than the average fantasy book, and I liked it a lot.The author takes things way too fast in the first 50 pages, though, where he'll spend 3/4-page on a fragment of a conversation between characters that haven't been introduced yet, in order to fill in some piece of history. He continues this until his hero gets old enough to control events. My advice: read the first 50 pages fast, pick up the flavor of events, and savor the rest of the book."
3,"Decent, but lacking","I liked his books at first, but then i noticed a dull pattern developing. He introduces new characters about every book so by the time you start liking one he moves on to a new one. He seems to introduce a character, have him be a regular guy for a time, then there is a mounting tension to a climax, then the character does something amazing that recieves reproach from his colleagues and he becomes a legend.... on with the next book... In all i say the novels are lacking information on the world and secondary characters. I have given up on his books for now, which is too bad since i see a new one every time i go to the store. But, give em a try to see for yourself"
4,Bookstore Price,"The book arrived on-time and in new condition. Ordering on line through Amazon and paying the shipping cost the price exceeds the cost of buying the same product at a retail bookstore. I have ordered several books and I am having second thoughts about what I am paying for the convenience of this kind of service. There is no volume order or out of print discount or break on shipping. Again, no complaints about the order or condition of the merchandise only the price. Regards"
2,terrible dialogue,"This book has a great story line, but it's very poorly written and the dialogue is painfully bad."
4,third favorite of the series,"This one is very good, but my third favorite in the series. Others that I've read in the series, besides my first and second favorites, are quite a bit behind this and the other two as far as enjoyment."
4,After 'The Magic of Recluce' you're comming home.,"The Magic of recluce was the first book to get me hooked. I'm dutch and couldn't wait until the towers of the sunset got to the stores, so I bought it online. The first time reading in English, but it was worth it. The other books of Recluce are ordered."
2,"Good, if you really know Japanese culture.","Unless your familiar with Japanese funerals, or are very culture curious then you will not like this movie. The film is billed as a comedy but really only Japanese (or people who have experience with Japan) can really understand the sarcastic look at typical Japanese funeral. Although I can appreciate Juzo Itami's work, I had a hard time watching this movie to the end. If you really want to know what a Japanese funeral is like in a long, drawn out manner, then give it a try. Once was enough for me.The way this dvd was transferred is truly horrible. Fox/Lorber are well known for doing things as cheaply as possible. Burned in subtitles which sometimes get cut off by the screen, bad translation, English grammar mistakes and poor color control are Fox/Lorber's trademarks. Too bad they just dont care anything about quality."
5,One of Itami Juzo's best,"The Funeral, along with Tampopo, are my two favorite Itami Juzo movies; others such as Supermarket Woman and A Taxing Woman are also quite good, but these two are the ones I most enjoy. The Funeral portrays what in many ways is a typical Japanese funeral although clearly some aspects have been exaggerated particularly for comic effect. While one might not think a funeral would be the best subject matter for a comedy, it in fact is very funny while maintaining real respect for the solemnity of the occasion. In this movie Itami provides a touching look at the ritual of the funeral and how that ritual helps people to deal with the loss of a loved one. Touching and humorous and great fun."
2,After a year it is just another shot glass...,"I gave one of these to my sweetie as a stocking stuffer. It is very accurate and we found it more handy than separate measuring spoons. However, the printing has all but vanished after just a few runs in the dishwasher. It has been hand washed most of the time."
4,Solid,"Because of all the other reviews we wash this by hand, but it has been fine. Would buy another if I needed one."
4,go to vessell,"most people use the little spoon measurers, but I like to prep all my ingredients before I start cooking the"
5,No more spills.,This item does what I want it to do. I can measure small amounts of liquid without spilling it- unlike the standard measuring spoons.
2,Not what you might think,"This book is primarily a documentation of the extensive influence of government and corporate agendas on the development of communications science. The title is misleading in two ways: the actual book is neither about the science itself nor is it about coercion, which generally involves the use of force. A more accurate title would have been ""Propaganda and the Development of Communication Science"" or something like that.Buy this book if you really want to know the details of every government grant that supported the foundation of communication science.Do not buy this book if you want to understand what those grants--or those foundations--actually were all about."
4,"A little cliche, but still a good read.","Although this book was somewhat predictable and Ms. Coel seemed to be on her soap box environmentally, I still enjoyed the story. The mystery part of the book was exciting enough, and I still really like Father John. The book is about a large energy company wanting to put a nuclear waste dump site right smack in the middle of Wind River Reservation. Despite all the jobs that this site would yield, Vicky Holden cannot go along with the idea, and she publishes her viewpoints in the local papers as well as at local meetings. Then there is the old cowboy that Father John finds murdered in an abandoned cabin. Do these two things have something in common? Before Vicky and Father John find out, more murders occur on their Reservation. What makes these books so special are Coel's characters. They are very real and very well-drawn. This is a very good series."
2,Not as expected,"I purchased this book at a reasonable price but was very disappointed to receive the book with a permanent crease down the right side of the front cover and two punctures on the left side. I do not consider this book to be in ""good"" condition as rated by the seller. Since Amazon and other sellers no longer bubble wrap books, I don't know how the book looked before shipping. I will probably hesitate to purchase a used book without being able to see it before purchase."
2,Predictable Politically Correct Environmental Party Line,"I enjoyed the first two novels in this series, but not this one. Her attorney protagonist became a shrill, irrational, self righteous zealot with no facts to support her breathless polemics. (All it would take is an unspecified ""natural disaster"" and then The Terrible Thing would happen!). The contrived ""factual"" rationalization for her position was as predictible as it was silly. This is a novel long on overly emotional protagonists drenched in self absorbed angst and prolix, confession prone bad guys, but short on rational plot development. It makes one long for Laconic Joe Leaphorn from Hillerman's novels. If you like the manufactured emotional trapeze of a soap opera, you will like this book."
2,"Fact Sheet, not a book","I got this book to help me choose a college. It doesn't list the majors, it only has little facts about each school in it like costs, student teacher ratio, the school setting and the campus size. Not really a good book if you want in depth information. I would like to know what they offer to study more the how many big the campus is..."
3,"Ok, but could be better","I originally bought the book to learn more about russian watches. However, as clearly stated in the introduction, they don't waste space with pretty stories. Basically, this is an image archive of different types of watches.In itself, such a reference guide could be quite handy. However, only a small subset of watches are covered - this is understandable, but classics like the original Shturmanskie isn't there at all - and I had to look hard to find the Okean. Another drawback is that most of the pictures are black and white. This was probably done to save money, but it greatly lessens the book's usability as a reference guide. The lack of descriptions also makes it not much more than a last resort when trying to check if a watch you're considering to buy is original or not.The book does have some more detailed imagery of certain movements, but in total I find it incomplete and disappointing. If you're looking for a reference guide, get another (and bigger) book."
2,Dangerous for Bees,"I had read articles about the use of spinosad to control leaf miners and wanted to try it on some citrus trees. Since the Amazon information labeled the product as ""organic lawn and garden insect control,"" I assumed wrongly that the product was in the safer-to-use category that includes neem and BT. When the product arrived, I noticed that the printed label on the bottle does not use the word ""organic,"" so I read the instructions with extra care. The product has been approved for organic use by the USDA, but the information booklet also warns that1. the product is dangerous for bees for up to 3 hours after it is applied. They recommend using the product in a area with no blooming plants2. the product is dangerous for fish and must not be sprayed on waterI certainly cannot use it in my garden... the bees are all too precious and I rarely have a time here in Georgia when something isn't in bloom.Back to BT and neem.Pat"
3,hard to tell,I haven't seen any difference; I bought this to get rid of a vine borer but I think by the time I bought the product it was too late - there was too much damage to the pumpkin vine. So I picked my pumpkin in early August and hopefully it will last until October? I'll keep the product in my garden supplies should I need it again and will give it another try.
2,nervous music,"the music on this disc sounds pretty nervous to me. It is not my favourite. From Prokofiev I know Alexandr Nevsky; Ivan the Terrible; Fiery Angel; symphony 1,5 7 and Luitenant Kije. Compared to that this is not good. Perhaps I have misseds omething. The sound quality is good as far as I can tell."
5,Oil,Bottles arrive in great shape considering they are glass. I add 10 drops of oil for flavor to 2 TBLS of olive oil for stir fry. Good tastes!!
4,Classic South Park,This was another quality season turned in by Matt and Trey. The Heavy Metal episode was inspired and the commentaries definitely leave you wanting more. The Goth kids season finale was a great way to go out in high style.
5,getting better and better!,"Get ready for fourteen hilarious episodes on what I think is the best season of South Park yet!!! If you like political humor and a bunch of potty mouth kids you will absoulutly love it,but be warned its not for people who get easily offended. Other than that enjoy!"
3,One of the Weaker Seasons,"I am a devout South Park fan and own all 12 seasons currently on DvD. Season 12 is, easily, one of the weakest seasons. Trey and Matt didn't spend enough time outlining new episodes in the offseason, and it clearly shows. I don't know why they don't stick to simpler episodes. The vast majority of the ""great"" South Park episodes take place solely within the small town and have just one or two strong plot points. I am disappointed in this season.Best Episode: ""Ungroundable""Worst Episode: ""Pandemic (Part I)"" and ""Pandemic (Part II)"""
2,Buy the others first...,"Saw these all online and TV. Worth owning if you're a psycho-fan, but this season is seriously lacking in the story department. It's like Matt and Trey thought up ""10-minutes-of-funny"" for each episode and then stretched it out to meet the 22-minute requirement. Not their best work. Not trying to slam them, but definitely VERY dissapointed with this season. Been a fan for a decade, and this is NOT ""MUST OWN"" material.If you had to buy a few, grab seasons 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Those are my favorites. I will be waiting for this one to significantly drop in price before I complete my collection. I do love this show, just not this box set."
5,Freaking hilarious season!,"South Park continues to be the funniest, most entertaining TV show there is. It's hard to believe Stone and Parker can keep coming up with the stuff in each show 12 seasons later but it is still hilarious. Britney Spears episode: genius. They even make fun of every situation the boys have been in from the general population's point of view in the pan flute band/giant guinea pig episode when Clyde tells them that no one likes them because they purposely get themselves in these situations. Freaking hilarious. Good stuff!"
5,DVD,The DVD arrived on time and everything was fine . Your service was everything you claimeed and I was completely satisfied .
3,Not as good as seasons past,Love South Park and almost buy the complete seasons as a habit now... Wasn't as impressed this go round.
5,South Park-The Twelfth Season,I am a collector of south park. I have been missing the episodes on tv. I like to wait for the seasons to come out on dvd.
3,South Park may be headed for a downward spiral,"Let me start by saying that I do love South Park, and will probably watch it into season 43, but I can't deny this season may be the begining of the downward spiral. Its not that this season doesn't have some funny moments, but nothing hits the belly laughs or even social commentary of previous seasons. While before south park attacked little eli gonzales or the recount issue, this season we attack...Peruvian pan flutes groups. Really? Has South Park run out of topics? I mean sure they took a stab at high school muscial, but that's like making fun of vanilla ice, everyone does it at least once, so it looses its meaning. Now, I don't want to make this seem like the worst thing ever, there are some very funny moments, but overall, this season makes me wonder if the show shouldn't end sooner than later, and avoid becoming the simpsons, a show you don't watch out of want or desire...but out of habit."
4,Great Addition To Blu-Ray Collection,"This is a great addition to you blu-ray collection, I love southpark and now it is even better in HD. The only problem I have with any TV show available for purchase is the price. I know these companies have to make money and blu-rays aren't cheap, but the show has already made its money. Why do they need to charge 50$ so I can own it on blu-ray, if these were $25 or $30 a piece, I would be buying them like it was candy."
5,Excellent Series,"South Park has continued to poke fun at ""sacred cows."" As usual, there are different topics covered, so, lay back and enjoy!"
5,Good season to buy,I originally bought this season in hopes that I would be able to watch this season with Drunken Commentary that these guys put into movies like Cannibal the Musical. Unfortunately this only has limited commentary. I still love the quality of the season just would hope that extra features could be just a bit more. Overall I still fully support my purchase and encourage others to buy this season. the EAP episode alone sold me.
5,Awesome!,This came in time for Christmas and my son is thrilled to add more to his collection. Very nice purchase!
2,Crappy Box,The Show and Season itself is good but amazon sent me the crappy plastic case instead of the nice normal one. This really makes me mad and i think i'l just sell this one to a friend for my money back and get the better version.
3,Careful,"I bought mine brand new from Amazon, shipped by Amazon too. They came sealed, however, they did not come with the flyers/Comedy Central ads that another person who bought it from the exact same way did. This has upset me severely."
1,Nauseous,"I wish I had something nice to say about this collection of 60's wannabe hacks. Unfortunately, I am not deaf. I would liken the sound of the lead singer's voice to a dying cat, but I am an animal lover, and would not want to insult the cat. If you'd like to spend [money] on a shiny coaster, or there is a need in your life for a skull-piercing headache, then I suggest this album. Otherwise save your money."
5,Best gun,This gun is definitly the best gun I ever used. It has very good weight. The gun is acurate up to 50ft and it is the most powerful spring gun i have ever used. It has an open ejection port so you can see the ammo being loaded. it also has a lock so when you pull back the slide you can lock it back and snap it forward when you tough the button. The safty is only operable when you have the hammer back. Very good gun!
5,Not the same movie?,"I believe this is NOT the Nelson Eddy movie, which was in black and white, but there's absolutely nothing else on this page to indicate which movie it is."
4,"goes with ""God Bless America""","Patriotic and reverently presented, it is a good DVD, done at about the same time as 'God Bless America.' Victory and hope seem to be the theme. 'God Bless America' is more diversified, I think, and has some extraordinary talent, (that one would not see often). The Vocal Band's first song on 'Let Freedom Ring' is not my favorite, but this must not discourage you, because -I can assure you- their last song which is actually the song,'Let Freedom Ring,' beats even the performance they did for the US President. I was inspired. The Martin's were great, and he Hoppers lively and entertaining, with other good songs from other good folks as well.Not that I am a worthy critic, but in just about any production, there is something that I would probably have changed or left out. Nonetheless, overall, these were especially good purchases for me, and I am ever so careful about spending money. So, there you go. Mickey"
5,Wonderful DVD,"This DVD is the second of two of Bill Gaither and his homecoming friend performing at Carnagee Hall, primarly in honor of 9/11.,The first DVD ""God Bless America"" I have owned for sometime now, this is the the second DVD continuing future into the night that they performed at Carnagee Hall. it was about a 4 hour performace, and was well received by those in a attendance. ""Let Freedom Ring"" the second DVD is nearly good as the first ""God Bless America""Buy or rent both if you want to listen to and watch a great group perform!"
1,Innacurate growth chart!,"The measurement on this growth chart is not accurate, the company did not take into account the ribbon attaching the boards together, therefore making the measurements innacurate. This was a complete disappointment since I like the design on the board, it goes well in my toddlers room (sports theme). The company needs to make the measurements more accurate."
2,No John here,"I liked the movie. The soundtrack is ok\. It's fun to listen to these guys, it makes me appreciate John's talent even more. But I was dissappointed in the fact that it said that this enhanced soundtrack had two videos ... after I got it I found out that the videos aren't really in this package you have to take this CD insert it into your computer and go to a website to see those videos ... I'm not computer savy and I haven't seen any video yet ... this [..] sucks. Why didn't they just include the videos as a separate DVD in this package(like they did with John's ""Hurt"" video), guess they wouldn't have been able to make extra $ by having smucks like me go to their website."
4,SIMPLY ADORABLE!,"The hats featured in this book are REALLY cute and clever. Unfortunately, however, some of the pattern sizing seems wonky (even though I made gauge swatches) and some of the patterns slightly unclear. Also, there are some small details not to my liking (the drawstring tie on the kitty hat), but nothing that I couldn't figure out how to change. Irregardless, I do highly recommend the book (especially if you're looking for something ""different""), as does my two-year-old daughter who will spend hours just looking at the pictures! :)"
2,worst of adam sandler,these two i think were the worst of adam sandler besides little nicky Mr. deeds was entertaining but he does not spend any of the money he gets to the end so dissapointing big daddy was alright but he could of taught the kid to be a lot worst and it would have been funnier
3,"Kind of flimsy, but maybe that's what you get for the price?","I'll admit I'm definitely a cooking novice, but I kind of expected more out of this. It's only okay, gets the job done if you need it to. If you need something cheap to help with dipping, this will do, but it's not super high quality."
5,Work Great!,"Amazon was $2.00 cheaper than any of my local stores on his item. Plus with my Prime account, they were here fast! Not sure what people expect from a candy dipping set but I find them built sturdy. If you can eat with a fork you shouldn't have any dexterity problems using these to dip candies."
2,Candy Dippers,"I was hopeful it would make the job easier, but it really didn't. It was trickier to slide the candies off with the tools that to just use a tooth pick like I have for years. I am going to give it another go for Valentines Day as maybe it just takes a while to get the hang of it."
3,Candy dippers,"I am sure this is a nice product but it didn't work for me. For the candy I was making I needed much longer handled dippers. So I returned them. I found the correct product at a store that specializes in candy tools. It is hard to buy these things online, but I tried."
4,Drama in the sky,"This story is very involving and very dramatic, I enjoyed the bravery of the main character, fighting in disadventage with the nature and trying to make the impossible come true. It's a very emotional story from the beginnings of the aviation and the dangers of a night flight in these early years of the plane"
2,C'est ne pas Le Petit Prince... avec les larmes et les souris...,"(Je vous demande pardon, mais mon franais n'est pas tres bon. La dernière fois que j'ai ecrit en franais c'etait à l'école et beacoup d'années ont passé.)Bon... on parle du livre.C'est une histoire trés triste.Il y a trois personnages qui sont beacoup differentes. Un pilote qui aime sa profession tellement qu'il risque sa vie. Un directeur qui semble tre dur et insensible, mais qui cache bien ses vrais émotions et un inspecteur, qui voudrait tre un ami puis qu'un boss.Une tragedie annoncé, mais les chose ne changerons pas."
5,It rulz,"I think the book is kind of weird. Um Elizabeth finally told Conner that she loves him, But I think Jess is being to jeoules that Jeremy is going out with Jade,she's the one that dumped him for Will. Conner tries avoiding Tia, but Tia gets mad and sees that Conner is drinking. About Andy...I dont know. Francine Pascal already put a gay guy in SVU. Why want more?"
4,okay,"this book was okay. i mean, its kinda strange how jessica suddenly likes jeremy again, i mean, she must feel pretty stupid for choosing will over him now! but still, it seems kinda unrealistic that out of the blue she just likes him again...and jade kinda seems wrong for jeremy. i thought she and jessica were friends? it doesnt seem like it. jade is portrayed a lot differently in this book...wilder, not as nice. i think conners really headed for trouble, since he has started drinking so much whenever he has some kind of problem. thats a really bad habit to get into. i also think he was being really cruel to tia, even though he was drunk. anyway, cant wait for the next book! especially to find out what happens to conner...and also andy."
4,It's Worth Reading,"This book was not the best in the series, but it was a pretty good book. Conner finally tells Tia off, but he is still drinking in this book. I think it is about time for Liz to move on without Conner because of everything he has put her through! Jade was getting on my nerves because she is soooooooo annoying! I think Jeremy should get back with Jessica but she was dumb to dump him in the first place. The ending to this book has a exciting twist, so I can't wait to read the next one!"
4,AS IF I CARE,"ok... this is what i think. this book was good, just tiring. i just luv the fact that liz told conner that she loved him. it was a magical moment! j/k. i think it's tiring that tia is clinging to him! tia needs to stop. she knows how much they luv each other and she's saying she needs to talk...as if!i really really hate the 3 j triangle. what's with all these j names? jade is annoying! she should know that they really luv each other if they r going trough all this! i think jessica's just as annoying! she just likes him because he likes someone else! how shallow! i thought jess was better than that.i really feel bad 4 addy. poor guy. his own friends won't even listen to him. these r the friends he calls best friend. he really should scream it out or something. it's really sa actually. his friends won't even support him or help him because they r all self-absorbed.as u can see...there is a lot of drama."
5,Excellent CD,"This CD is AWESOME. I originally found out about Over it from a Rufio show. I was bored one night and had a friend come with me to see Rufio. I researched a little on Over It and thought they were pretty good. When they hit the stage I was suprised. They were on tee on all songs. All the sounds were catchy but not crappy Good Charlotte pop punk. The songs have substance. I grabbed the CD and keep listening to it. ""Shine"", ""Siren on the 101"", and ""Waiting"" are the best on the CD.I highly suggest Over It's ""Silverstrand"". Pick it up now before they get big. I can see them blowing up soon."
3,"eh, it's okay","first off, i'd like to start off by saying that the amazon track listing for ""silverstrand"" is off. The actual album doesn't have 13 songs, it has 12 (11 if you don't count the intro), and all of the songs are arranged out of order.As for the album itself, I thought that ""Siren on the 101"" overpowered the rest of the album, with ""shine"" and ""ingore the noise"" being slight exceptions. Overall, it's a solid rock record, but I would have like more songs as good as siren.Highlights: Siren on the 101, Ignore the NoiseMidpoints: Everything else exceptLowpoints: Chef Yan (it has a good chorus, but the verses suck).I give this album 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."
3,magic of rupurt's people,"A collective of their hits . Includes a very good booklet inside with history of band. Some tracks also appear on the Fleur de Lys album. Best songs for me are hold on and reflections on Charles Brown. (good original of Reflection on the album also) also includes a previously unreleased track direct from original acetate but a good sound none the less. I personally was disappointed with the live tracks at a reunion in 1999 which consists of covers of songs by the beatles,rolling stones and the small faces. Overall worth a listen."
5,Best Bukka White CD Available,"After searching fruitlessly for a new copy of ""The Complete Bukka White"" I was lucky enough to stumble onto this one. It has all the songs on that CD plus 6 more, making it without question the best Bukka buy out there at the moment. These are his pre-war, stronger recordings and are essential listening."
3,relaxing moments,A very simple and clever product. Put yourself lying on a beach even if you are constricted in a grey town.
3,"Not quite your usual ""easy listening""...","Ok, of course ""Aranabee"" simply means R&B as in ""rhythm and blues,"" but there isn't a whole lot of R&B in here. This diverges from most similar efforts (orchestral takes on pop songs) in that some of the melodies aren't quickly recognizable. You don't always find yourself humming the tune being covered. You can't record ""I Got You Babe"" without it being recognizable, but that doesn't apply to all of the covers. And it's nice that Mr. Jagger gave us a vocal on the last song. A few more cameo vocals would have been even better. This isn't individualistic enough to move it totally away from the old ""easy listening"" music category, but it does have some level of uniqueness."
5,Amzing Love is AMAZING...,"Amazing Love lives up to it's name, It's AMAZING! With a variety of styles throughout and sung by top notch singers, this cd is the 5th album in the Hillsongs worship series and undoubtably the best. You'll want to take it with you everywhere with all your other Hillsong cds. hehehe. You can expect nothing better than the best from Hillsong and Amazing love delivers. Top notch!"
5,Brilliant!,"This book contains some of the most bloody,sexy material you could ever read.If you are in for a good read,then this is the novel for you.The stories are neither too long nor too short.I am not writing a thorough review beause there are some excellent reviews on this page,so I recommend them just as much as the book!Think of this book as a great movie with four great actresses!It is really good...enjoy...Nigel."
3,Davidson Great! Hamilton Yuk!,"The three stars are for Davidson, Wilks and York. If there was a minus score, I'd give it to Hamilton. M.J. Davidson is one of my favs and I wasn't disappointed. Her dialog always makes my LOL. It's the first time for the other three and I enjoyed the imagination and stories of Wilks and York. Trust me when I say I will NEVER buy or read anything by Hamilton again. More than a waste of money (since the other three stories were great) Hamilton was a waste of my time. I enjoy paranormal and really admire the wonderful imaginations that think this stuff up. Hamilton's ""Blood on my Lips"" was just junk!"
1,Not a good start,"After having several friends rave about Laurell K Hamilton I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to see what she was about. I didn't understand any of it. The short story makes absolutely no sense at all. It is one big almost orgie. I found it frustrating and left me confused. I won't bother with any of her other works if this is what they are like.The remaining stories were uninteresting really and barely memoriable. Although I did find a couple of small chuckles mixed in them. MaryJanice Davidson's Dead Girls Don't Dance would have to have been the most amusing of the three only because of the airhead, queen of the undead."
4,Very Good Collection of Shorts,"I purchased this book as a big Anita Blake fan after finishing I am now also a fan of Wilks and Davidson, I am not saying that Hamilton's submission was a bad one but as other reviewers stated it is only a few chapters of her new novel coming out, York's story was indeed good but not nearly as intriguing or well written as Wilks and Davidson's.Wilks - Original Human actually made me run out a buy a couple of her novels very well written with a number of wrong guesses leading to the end.I also enjoyed Davidson's Dead Girls Don't Dance I found it had a nice blend or witty humor and intrigue.As I've said the other two submissions were good I just did not enjoy them as much as the two mentioned above and I really would have rather waited for LKM's novel to get released rather than reading part of it now.I found this collection well worth my time and money"
2,Incubus Dreams,The Laurell K. Hamilton contribution to this collection is taken directly from her book Incubus Dreams. What a rip off for Anita Blake fans.
4,Research Before You Buy...,"First off, I bought the book for Laurell K Hamilton's work. Before reading it, I knew it was not indeed a short story, but an sample of her book that is due out in September (Incubus Dreams). I found the sample extremely frustrating, but at the same time it was excellent. Frustrating because I need to know what happens next, and excellent because it managed to develop two characters who have been two-dimensional so far. It's a must read for Anita fans who are as impatient as I am.Dead Girls Don't Dance was the other story that I also enjoyed, mostly because it is quite similiar to Hamilton's style of writing. However, I found the main characters somewhat boring. The story itself was interesting: the emotional struggles of a young vampire.This anthology was definitely worth the 8 dollars, but you have to know what to expect before buying it."
3,DON'T READ THE HAMILTON STORY B4 INCUBUS DREAMS!,"Overall an OK Anthology, but I regretted reading the Hamilton story before Incubus Dreams. It is NOT an independant story about the Anita Blake series characters but rather a ""preview"" of the first third of the novel. Read it afterward... or not at all, because the remainder of the stories were somewhat boring."
3,"2 good, 1 bad, 1 shameful","This was a true some good, some bad collection.LKH- shame on her for not bothering to write a story for this anthology! This story was a few chapters pulled from one of her Anita Blake books. Really, if she was committing to writing a story for this anthology, she should have had the integrity to actuall write one, not cheat and use something she already had.MJD- her stort was too cute. I'm only a little familiar with her Queen Betsy series as I only read the first few of the series. Can't remember why I turned away from the series, but now want to get reacquainted with her world again!EW- my least favorite. I wasn't familiar with her before this story and won't bother to read anything else by her either.RY- liked this story a lot. I will definitly find more books by this author."
2,Don't buy if you've read Incubus Dreams,"I got this hoping to see a new Anita Blake story, but unfortunately, it was an excerpt from Incubus Dreams. The other stories did not live up to Laurell K Hamilton's high standard. The writing for the other stories was juvenile and went from ""I'm not human"" to ""have sex with me anyway"" in a ridiculously short time. If you're looking for supernatural stories with good character development and excellent plots with a side of steamy sex, just stick to the Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry series by Hamilton and skip this book."
3,3 stars so far...,"I got the book from the library and glad I didn't buy it. I've become more and more bored and annoyed with Hamilton's contribution to this book. Normally I can't put her stuff down but it's been 4 days now and I haven't finished her ""short story"". Hopefully the others will pick up."
3,"I dunno, it was ok","I'm a big horror fan and specifically love Stephen King and Charlaine Harris. I bought the book for Laurell but was disappointed by most of the stories.Perhaps it's because I just don't enjoy the short story; or more succinctly, I haven't found an author who can hold me with a short story. They can't really grip me with less than 20 pages and I want more from the stories and the characters. In fact, the book is upstairs in my bedroom with 1/3 left for me to read and I still haven't read Laurell's story yet!I want a writer who will grip me and thrill me. Not too many of those."
2,Not a short story ...,"The offering by Laurell K. Hamilton is a chapter from her new book Incubus Dreams. The only reason I bought this book was for her short story, only to find out that it's in her new book, so now I've read it twice (I've already read Incubus Dreams). As far as the other authors' works - I cannot comment. I just wish publishers would let a person know that it's a chapter from a book coming out a few months after."
1,One out of Four Ain't Bad? Is it?,"Don't waste your money on this one. The only one worth reading is by MaryJanice Davidson. This book is 8 dollars and it is not worth 2.The anita story is so dumb, I am tired of all the weird boyfriends, not to mention girlfriends. Hamilton writes a good book, but her short stories are not so hot.Eileen Wilks is one author I have never read before. I did not care at all for the story. With a name like cravings and 3 good authors we should get at least 3 good stories.But Rebecca york even lets us down. I loved all the moon books. Witching Moon was my favorite. However, when they say a wolf mates for life, I thought he mated for his life. Obviously with this story we learn he mates for her life. I felt she let us down on this one.DEAD GIRLS DON'T DANCE is funny and gives us a glimpse of her next book. UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED. So for my part MaryJanice Davidson is still a good read."
3,Skip the Laurell Hamilton offering,"This book was actually pretty good. Skip the Hamilton offering and read the Rebecca York and the Davidson offerings, they're pretty good."
4,Five cheers for York and Wilks!,"I disagree with some of the other reviews. The stories I liked best were by Rebecca York and Eileen Wilks. From reading Rebecca York, I'd say her specialty is tortured heroes. In this story, she did a fantastic job of writing about a werewolf who had lost his lifemate and was totally focused on killing the man who murdered her. But he met a strong, sexy woman who brought him back to life.I liked the alternate universe Ms. Wilks created in her story. I hope she is going to do more stories using this alternate reality. Her hero was fantastic, and I loved the secret that was revealed about him. He feared the heroine would reject a man like him, but he was wrong.This fan of the paranormal liked the tension and the characters in both these stories. Both these stories are more serious in content than the other two. And I want to read more by both these authors. Their stories rate 5 stars."
3,"Some good, Some bad","Some stories stood alone and others you needed to have read the author before. Hamilton's ""Beyond the Ardeur"" was almost incomprehensible since I had not read the author before. It was slow and boring and I almost didn't finish it. 2 stars is kind for this story. Davidson's ""Dead Girls Don't Dance"" was cute, especially if you are a Queen Betsy Fan, 5 stars from me. Wilks' ""Originally Human"" stands alone and is a pretty good story, 4 stars. Finally, York's ""Burning Moon"" is another good story, 4 stars."
4,I would rather give it 4.5 stars,"Being a former Anita Blake fan, I bought this book because of Rebecca York. However, I have to give credit where credit's due. I agree with some of the reviews that this wasn't the place for a short interlude into Anita Blake's world, but this small piece was better than LHK's last few books in the series. A little slow in the beginning, but now I'm actually thinking about buying Incubus Dreams instead of getting it from the library.As for Rebecca York, keep the good times rolling, girl. The last three books in your Moon Series (???) were incredible. Since then, I've been dying to read more.I knew knew nothing about Eileen Wilks or MaryJanice Davidson. I'm glad I've had the chance to sample their writing because that means I can add two more authors to add to my Must-Read list."
4,York is always good,"I bought the book because of Rebecca York. I'd just finished her three moon books and wanted more. The short story here was a nice addition, and I hope there will be more of these werewolf stories.Originally Human, by Eileen Wilks, was my second favorite. Her characters kept my interest and she had a spark of humor. I'd really like to know more about the sorcerer, Cullen, if she gets back to this realm, and I can see lots of room for expanding on the story of the two characters here - I *want* to know what happens to them next.Mary Davidson's story was good. I haven't read her before, but ads for her books looked interesting.I was disappointed in the Hamilton story. In fact, I didn't read it all the way through. It started interestingly enough, but went downhill, seemingly more about sex than story, unfortunately.Still worth the money for the other three, though."
1,Dirty Pool,"I love LKH and will definitely be buying her next Anita novel. But I bought THIS book expecting to get a short story about my favorite characters. A short story has a beginning, a middle, and an END. Nowhere on this book does it say one word about her offering being an excerpt from the upcoming Incubus Dreams. Her story is called ""Blood Upon My Lips"" and is presented in a short story anthology, but it isn't a short story at all. I think that is a gross misrepresentation and dirty pool on Ms. Hamilton's part. If she wanted to advertise for her newest novel that's fine, but we should have been able to make an informed choice before spending eight bucks. Instead we are just left hanging and got as little satisfaction from our encounter with Anita, Nathaniel, and Damian as they did.Hopefully, the other stories will make up for being rooked by LKH. I haven't read them yet because I was so mad after reading her story I pitched the book over the back of the couch."
3,Laurell K. Hamilton Fans- beware!,"This is only for those of you, who, like me, are interested in the book simply because you love Anita Blake and Laurell K. Hamilton. The so-called ""novella"" in this anthology is merely excerpted from her novel ""Incubus Dreams."" I read the novella first, and was extremely disappointed in the way it ended- with unresolved issues- and even more disappointed when I began reading ""Incubus Dreams,"" because I'd already read much of the first 8 or 10 chapters! Hamilton includes more in the full novel, but it was a real let-down when I realized what she had done. I give the collection a lot of credit, but not the portion written by Hamilton."
2,Dissapointed,I just bought and read this book. The Hamilton story seemed very famaliar then I realized it was from Incubus Dreams. The other stories were ok. I wouldn't have bought this if Hamilton didn't have a story in it. Too bad it was a story I already had.
4,A must have.,"This book is quite an appetizer for the different books that are sampled in it. I now wait with clenched teeth of anticipation for Incubus Dreams by Laurell K Hamilton. As well as now on the ""hunt"" for books from the other authors. MaryJanice Davidson's story ""Dead Girls Don't Dance"" is funny with alot of wit and sarcasm; not to mention the fact that the not so popular girl in college gets the jock superstar. Can't wait for the rest of the book."
5,A great book to start playing with polymer clay,This is a great book and the only one I have bought about PC so far. It has so many fantastic projects that you will want to try them straight away! The projects are all very colourful and funky and a lot of fun to make. There is a section that covers the basics which is enough for someone who has never tried their hand at PC. Highly recommended!
4,Polymer Clay Ideas,Great ideas for polymer clay projects. Helps too for when things don't turn out exactly the way you expected them to.
5,Another GREAT song by Savage Garden,Once again Savage Garden comes out with an awesome song. Every time I listen to this song it just gets better and better. Like another person said I sing to it all the time. Its just sooo good. Everything Savage Garden does is amazing. Darrens voice is so beautifull. These guys are the best to me. Savage Garden Forever!!!!
5,This is great!!!!!!!!!,"The Animal Song is gorgeous!!!! The movie ""The Other Sister"" was great too. Can't wait for August... Goodluck to Darren and beautiful Daniel!!"
4,Savage Garden is still blooming,"""The Animal Song"", which appears in the movie ""The Other Sister"" and will appear on Savage Garden's upcoming album (which will be released in August) shows how much they have evolved since their self-titled debut album. The lyrics, for all their joyful metaphors, suggest a deeper theme which reflects the primitive human need for a few moments of complete freedom in this hectic and binding life. The upbeat rhythm and hooky harmonies are sure to get stuck in your head."
5,"On a scale of 10, this deserves a 100!!!","Finally a new song, and in a relativly short period of time, a new album out of my favoutite group of all time! I love Darren's voice, he hits some fabulously high notes that make my mind and heart soar, with lyrics that I can't get out of my head. I can't wait to go to sleep with that song stuck on repeat in my cd player! Fantastik work, Darren and Daniel! ~Cloe Rose"
5,This Cd RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!,I really love The Animal Song!!! I think the drum intro rocks :) I was surprised when I found out they weren't real :) Get this song it's really cool!
5,Another Great Song From Savage Garden!,"Once again Savage Garden has come out with another fantastic song! With Darren Hayes' incredible vocal range and Daniel Jones' excellent keyboarding skills, this is a song you won't soon forget!"
5,Everything's nice about this song..,"The beat's good, the lyric's good, the tune's good, so's the singers...what more could you want? Buy it! Tho it doesn't have lyrics it's quite easy to hear from the CD"
5,By Far Their Best!,"Intertwined lyrics, and rich melodic tones prove that Savage Garden is far from one hit wonders. ""..I want to live..."" Great voice, with a profound music video. From the Movie ""The Other Sister"", this is a song, that you must get. Also check out the movie, for it is sure to be astronomical!"
1,Totally Awful,"Hey, I'm a lesbian mom myself. I have two great kids. I was given this book as a gift. What a horrible book. Difficult to read, full of 1970s impossible to comprehend propaganda. Almost seems like the crazy right-wing wrote it, there is so much to object to. How on earth is artificial insemination a subject for kids, and if it was, surely there is a less textbook, more creative positive way to portray it?? Surely. At best, this book is an artifact of good intentions, and little more."
3,the message backfires,"First off all, this book deserves some credit for being one of-if not the very first- books for kids dealing with gay parents. This book has a sweet story and is appropriate for small children- not too gritty or 'adult' or anything.However the attempt at showing 'alternative' families in a positive light backfires- the lesbian couple is a caricature of steryotypical butch/femme couple one might see on a... sitcom. The 'two mommies' reinforced a lable rather then break it and show them in a positive light. I'm sure the author was trying to be 'authentic' but all that was accomplished was the women looking even MORE different and 'weird' and heather looking even more alien then similar to a male/feamle household. I thought that was really unfortunate."
4,"Loved it, hated it","I recently got ""married"" to my wyfe. Her 4 yo daughter is trying to understand, but she lives with her father who is less than encouraging. We bought this as an aid for her and had 2 problems. 1, the names were hard to pronounce and grasp for her-we have never met anyone who were so named.2, she did not have the benefit of being conceived as shown, so we needed to alter it some. I would love to see another book about the subject, one a child can truely grasp, more easily read by the child or to it."
5,10th Edition does NOT include insemination info,"Several of the one-star reviews here refer to a different edition of this book. This edition (10) does not have anything about artificial insemination (to appease those who were offended). It is just a simple story showing lots of different families... not very in depth, not much to it, but a nice, ""feel good"" story line. I did not see ANY overt sexuality or ""inappropriate"" topics at all, as was mentioned by one or two of the other reviewers. I have not seen other editions so I cannot comment about those."
2,Creates more questions than it answers,"The book's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues. This approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a Lesbian led household - especially a girl child. If the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old, the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked.Doesn't everyone have a father, somewhere? Who is my father? What is he like? Where is he? Does he know about me? Does he care about me? Why don't I know? Why don't you know, Mommy?Mommy, when you grew up you lived with your Daddy, why don't I?When I grow up, should I live with a man or a woman? Why? How/when will I know? Does it matter? Is our family really a complete family if my father is unknown?I want to be a father some day. How do I learn what good fathers do?I love my friends and my dog;Does that make us a family?Think about it."
1,Heather has 2 mommies,"I found the detail that this book went into about artificial insemenation outrageous! It is extremely unappropriate for little children! This book should be banned from all shelves in Centerville Althought the overall message was nice, the detail is far too through fro young children. It was horrible having to explain this to my son Johnny."
1,Poor Heather,Heather gonna need alot of therapy. This book is expensive. Has nice illustrations. I would just borrow it from your local library.
3,Earnestly PC,"Jean-Claude Van Damme uttered the immortal line: ""I didn't make the world; I just live in it"" (Cyborg, c. 1989). On one level, this book is useful for those kids thrust into non-traditional family situations like those in HHTM. You could do worse than have the facts of your own familial structure explained to you by a kiddie book as opposed to the schoolyard bully, d'accord?That said, the book is a parody of political correctness. When Heather goes to day care (can't Heather get at least *one* stay-at-home mom?) there's only one family out of five that has a traditional mother-father family structure and a regular kid. Despite what the Buchanan Brigades may be telling us about American culture, the norm in the U.S. is still the nuclear family. A book reflecting that reality more clearly, rather than trying to twist reality into a PC pretzel, would have been preferred."
3,didn't realize they book was about a lesbian home,"Well, let's see... I have a son that's growing up in a split home... and I'm remarried. I thought this book was more along those lines. I tend to be quite liberal in my beliefs, but felt this was just not appropriate for a highly encouragible child. I have put it in the top of the closet until he's more at an appropriate age... maybe 10 or 12. The book was written in a very good manner that does help to illustrate how everyone has different family structures. I just didn't find it as something I want to introduce to my son at this time. The book is good and from what I thought was a classic... just not for me."

1,do NOT buy this brand,"Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
3,"Errr...just the reverse, actually.","The product description above is deeply flawed. As you read it, you may mistakenly believe as I did, that this is an adapter for European high-voltage appliances work on a 110v (American-style) household current.I ordered this product, thinking I would get an adapter for using a 220v appliance on a 110v wall outlet. It's exactly the reverse: This adapter is for using your US (& Japanese) 110v APPLIANCE on a 220v (EUROPEAN) wall socket.Whether the device is any good, I cannot say, having utterly no need for it nor chance to test it. The cost of mailing the thing back for a refund less restocking charges seemed to outweigh the benefit, so my adapter lies in a closet, unused."
2,Disapointed,"Service was oustanding, but I am disapointed in the selection of Duets by the 2 Singers."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY,"Laura Wagner's kvetching is enough to make you want to throw a tomato at her. The pictures are low quality, and it's much ado about nothing. You can learn more by doing a google search and looking up each woman on Wikipedia. What a waster of time and money."
1,1 Star,This book is bad. There's nothing new or interesting in it. One of the worst books I have ever read!
1,NO NO NO,"THIS IS A BORING, NAUSEATING BOOK! IT HAS NO GOOD STORIES AND HIDEOUS PHOTOS. DON'T BUY IT! THE GOOD REVIEWS MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THE AUTHORS FRIENDS."
1,Just not worth it,There seems to be a lot of differing opinions here but I have to agree with the all the reviewers below who said it was boring and not worth the price. It is a flimsy paperback with poor quality photos. I know McFarland is a tiny publishing house but when you spend almost $40 you expect a little more.
1,Don't waste the cash,"Almost all of the women written about here are b-movie stars and after reading this book it's not hard to see why they never became bigger stars. Based on what the authors tell us they didn't lead very interesting lives and although they claim their film roles were memorable I never heard of half of the movie mentioned. Killer Tomatoes is written very much in the style of the 1950s fan magazines. The gals are all portrayed as saints and victims and you are only given a glimpse into their private lives. I would have like to have learned a lot more about who they dated, who they hated, who was addicted to what! A lot of writers think a stars private business is none of our business but then why write the book? My other big problem is with the photographs. They are all grainy, low quality images. I am not going to complain about Jane Russell's rambling forward because she is in her eighties and I'm sure that was just added on to sell a few more books."
2,Yikes,"Its bad enough when 'writers' rewrite stories with nothing new to add. Its worse when important parts of the stories are left out. THere is absolutely nothing new in any of these stories, and I agree with the comment about Jane Russell's ""introduction"". The poor old lady probably didn't read this boring stuff."
3,You get what you pay for,Well first problem is the packing box. It is basically wrapping cardboard around the table with no real protection for the product. I could see everytime UPS dropped it. The table itself is a basic plastic topped table good for light use only.Price wise a good buy but spend a few dollars more for a better table.
1,This pad is absolute trash.,"I purchased this pad for my girlfriend and I so that we could play DDR without having to buy those flimsy cheapo pads. We were just begginers when we got this pad, and it was already displaying a huge amount of problems.Personaly I play on medium, and she plays on light. Withen not even a week of using this pad the left arrow sensor has literally shifted to the middle of the pad. There is NO WAY to fix this problem. I repeat, IT COULD NOT BE FIXED!So basically we paid $100 for a very expensive door mat. I have no idea why people have recommended this product, or why it has gotten so many great reviews. But you've been officially warned!(Also the same dilemma is now happening to the down arrow sensor, we are using the foam and we are folding the pad properly and taking good care of it. But for the safety of your wallet shop for something that is actually worth the money.)"
2,"If you really like DDR, buy a metal pad instead.","Pros:-much better than the flimsy standard pad-more stable and solid base-still portableCons:-from personal experience this pad will eventually start to misfire. The button(s) that misfire(s) varies, and so does the behavior (the button may not respond or it may just repeatedly act like it's being stepped on). Regardless of whether it's being used for xbox or ps2, this happens to most people. Just search the internet for gripes-based on the above, this pad should not cost more than $60.00 based on its life expectancy. $100.00 is too much money for something that breaks down within a few months.Bottomline:If you really like DDR and you're using it to workout, I recommend that you just buy a metal dance pad for $200. Yes, it is twice the price, but it's better than wasting $100 for something that only partially works after a relatively short amount of time."
1,Very poor construction results in useless product,"I purchased one of these pads a month and a half before christmas as a gift. Everyone loved it at first and we purchased a second pad so two people could play at once. Within 20 days after christmas, the first pad started demonstating operation problems: buttons not functioning when pressed and buttons sticking. About a month and a half after we purchased the second one, it too started showing the same problems. We purchased these pads in large part to the excellent reviews here. Apparently, these reviews were in reaction to the version 1 pad which appears to have a much longer life. At $100 a pad, having them die within a month or two seems like a huge rip-off. 100% failure rate within a few months is way too high. I'd suggest looking for another pad rather than purchasing this one."
3,Great while it last.,"I just got into DDR over the last couple of months and decided to get this pad from Toys R Us since it seemed like it was getting good reviews. Well, it works great for a few weeks, but if you're playing the game on Standard or Heavy, don't expect it to last long. In two months, I went through three of these pads and I am now on my forth one. It makes me really angry because they work so good before they break. I mean, it doesn't slide and it doesn't hurt your feet at all. My advice, if you get this, get an extended warrenty with it if it's offered, you'll need it."
2,Not what I expected.,"These pads are warrantied for 60 days. Ours (we purchased 2)worked great for 3 months, then slowly both started having problems. I contacted the company to see if there is anyway to have them repaired. They told me to buy new ones. Now you know what to really expect from these ""wonderful"" pads."
3,Alright Pad,"This pad is decent, I mean really good at first for the first while that you play it, its really good the response time is perfect, when you step it goes right to it. But the thing is now, is that ive had the pad for some months now, and the left arrow isnt working anymore.So that 100 dollars really isnt worth it. And I dont stomp all hard on the arrows either and it still isnt workin. So I dont think this pad is worth a 100 but nonetheless its a good pad."
2,Great for 5 weeks then.....,"I bought this pad fom my kids. Thet played it quite a bit, got pretty good, then a button started sticking. It is alot better than the BNS pads we got and returned. They didn't even wotk right out of the box. HOWEVER a pad costing $100 should last more than 5 weeks, before failure. I think this is unacceptible. Sure it is under warranty but the mean time failure (MTF)is very short. I am concerned that this one won't last either. It appears the quality of the igntion and the BNS pads have crashed. It looks like us poor consumers get burned!"
2,pad quit working,"ive had 2 of the soft pads and one metal pad from red octane and they all quit working after a couple months. and ive had some of my friends' pads go out. not sure if an unlucky streak or not, but had some trouble. the pad looks nice and works fine, but then had trouble after awhile when arrows wouldn't work right. it seemed like they got stuck in down position or stopped taking input after awhile."
3,"It just doesn't last, or maybe I'm playing too much...","I bought this pad 3 months ago, after my $30 pad broke. First, I would like to say that this pad is really great. It's comfy on your feet, even after playing for 2 hours straight, and it's very accurate and responsive. However, about 2 months after I bought it, one of the arrows stopped working right and the padding became mushy and more difficult to play on. I tried to fix that by adding some support underneath the pad, which did help. One month after that, though, I found a tear in the top of the pad right next to an arrow button, and some of the arrows are not registering every time.Now, if you don't play this game as much as my sister and I do, then, the pad might last longer. We each play it about 2 times a week for an hour or so each time. So try to judge how much you will use this pad before you buy it if the price seems a bit high. I'm sorry I can't give any other options for anyone who plays the game a lot."
1,THIS is a great pad?,"i just bought this pad, and i'm just learning ddr.this pad is terrible. i am literally not standing on the pad, and it's constantly registering a downward press.video games and peripherals are never returnable except for the same item, so now i'm just going deal with the fact that i blew a hundred dollars on something that will not work properly."
3,Klapa Fa Lindo,"If you are looking for Klapa sounds that you may have seen and heard on Rick Steves program on Croatia, this CD is not it. It is all women; not the rich male voices of the 1st & 2nd tenors, the bass singer, and the baritone. Probably beautiful to many, but I was disappointed."
2,broke after a couple of years of light use,bought this hoping it would last longer than typical cheaper aluminum bottle cages. used it on my mountain bike for a couple of years. i'm a cross-country rider and ride some bumpy stuff but nothing radical. it broke across the welds that hold the cage to the mounting part.
5,Great tool to also turn in bed,"Great product to help the handicapped. I have cerebral palsy and am having problems turning in my bed. This product has helped me so much. I love the lower horizontal bar that is just above the mattress. It is closer than the side of the bed. So it is easier to reach than the side of the bed (full size bed). It is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!! The image does not show you the strap that goes around the box-spring to secure the railing. So if you have a bed skirt, be aware you will have to have the skirt scrunched up under the strap on both sides. But the benefits make it worth it!!!!!!!!!"
1,The Sad State of Contemporary Fiction,"This book (much like the Scooby Doo Movie which the author also penned) is silly, self involved, and NOT funny. In short: an embarasment. Where are the future Denis Johnson's of the younger generation? Where is the angst of the contemporary American novel? We have too many sellout writing program cookie cutter type writers sans balls and talent who are a blight upon the present literary landscape...give me the real guts of Bukowski...the perversity of Millers, the outlaw spirit of Burroughs...real stuff, not kid stuff like Toy Collector..send this writer back to the play pen."
5,An ultra-modern and personal look at obsession in the 80's,"James Gunn is a rare type of writer capable of illiciting laughter and pathos within the same paragraph. The Toy Collector is a page-turning adventure into a troubled and active mind. Those interested in an ultra-modern, wickedly funny and often poignant look into pop culture will certainly enjoy this book."
1,Great Idea - Horrible Execution,"I bought this device for my 13 year old son. Great form factor, easy to install and use software. We transferred all his CDs onto the device quickly and easily and then the wheels came off the wagon. We could see all the songs on the device but could not get any of them to play. There is no tech support number-you can only send emails which go unanswered. I had a number of folks well versed in other MP3 players look at it with no luck. I returned it to the store and they could not get it to play either. Fortunately they were willing to take it back and we exchanged for another brand. Get an iPod if you can afford it-get any other MP3. Stay away from this it is awful!"
4,Good Stuff....,"The main reasons to buy it were:1.- Firmware update.2.- OGG, MP3, WMA...3.- FM tuner4.- Playback Battery duration5.- USB6.- My girl friend loves her ""iRiver IFP-790T 256 MB""7.- The ""iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter""8.- The ""iRiver SV-i700 Waterproof Case for iFP-700 Series""After a Firmware Update i can use it even on Linux. I can play all my songs. If i'm bored of my songs i can look for a good radio station. The battery seems to last for ever. The transference is very fast. I'm considered a better boy friend LOL. Great to listen my music while driving. I can even use it while swimming.The only defect i found was the use of the FM Transmitter. If you turn it on plugged to the FM Transmitter the player will behaves in a strange way."
4,i river mp3player,It is very handy and has a good quality of sound.The only disadvantage is --- it's very hard to navigate because the button is very small and sensitive.
3,Warning about OGG support and battery life,"Many other people have written good reviews about this player, so I won't go on about how great it is. Just thought I'd mention one thing for those of you who bought it, like me, because of OGG support: the battery life is basically non-existant with OGG.I used to wonder why my battery would die after about 4 hours of playing my OGG (Q6) files, until I loaded up some WMAs and tried playing them exclusively. I've now had at least 20 hours playing and the battery meter still shows full.Although I was warned about battery life with OGG, no-one ever told me it would only be about a tenth as much. I don't know where the blame lies here, but it makes the player unusable with OGG files!"
4,iRiver iFP 799T 1GB,"Excellent sound quality, easy intallation and file management, tons of features!My only complain/suggestion for improvement:the headphones design is terrible (the earbuds are too big and uncomfortable; they do not fit into my small ear canal and either fall out or hurt like hell. If you bought this product and experiencing the same issue with headphones, I would recommend Sony MDR-EX71SL."
5,Great little mp3 player,"I recently bought the 799T iriver and i can honestly say it is the best little device i have ever bought.pros: the sound is fantastic however i found the buds they came with we slightly unco,fortable in my ears. Its very small and great for working out. This winter i plan on skiing with it! From what i can tell it can can hold about 180-200songs (depending how large they are). The software it comes with is very easy to use.Cons: The joy stick is a litle tricky to use, and i find the usb connection is alittle slow if your tranfering a lot of songs (compared to fire wire)"
5,Great player,You need a memory player if you need something smaller and more durable than a CD MP3 player or hard drive MP3 player. This player fits the bill.If you listen to long audio files (books on tape or long DJ sets) this player can FF at a rate much faster than any other device I have seen. It also leaves off where you were playing inside a track when you turn it off or use the radio which is very nice.
3,iRiver 1GB MP3,"Hey what can I say. Nothing fancy but it works for what I want. A small and inexpensive mp3 player for short play use. No problems after several years. If you are looking for something to carry you through a week of travel and heavy play, get something bigger."
5,Best MP3 for the money,"I have had many brands and styles of MP3 players since they have been out and the iRiver iFP 799T is the best I have had so far. It is simple to use,it has great quality and long battery life."
5,Great Product,"This is the second iriver MP3 player I've owned and I love them both. The reason I bought a new model was because the old ones did not come with an armband and I wanted more memory. Of all the MP3 players I've looked at I like the look and feel of iriver the most. It is easy to use and the software is also user friendly. The only complaint I have is about finding a good price which I did NOT find at Amazon. The companies own website has this model for sale for $250, over $100 less than sold here. Most other websites sell it for even less. Do yourself a favor and shop around so you don't get ripped off."
4,iRiver iFP 799T 1gb MP3 player,"Overall good player. Download quality could be better. ""Any source"" recording is somewhat difficult to use, poor quality. Computer software is hard to understand at first, seems restrictive. On occasion static is heard in the music, unsure where it originates. Seems better than the iPod."
3,Spyware,"The item works great as indicated by previous reviews.That said, the bad news.1. You cannot use this as a straight USB drive. You HAVEto use iriver's proprietary interface software.2. Also when you install the software iriver will installa nice sleeper (spyware) type program called update.exe.very uncool.overall a great peice of hardware with some poor software.Adam"
1,Garbage - Buttons wore out in 14 mos.,"I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again."
5,This MP3 player is WAY TOO COOL!,"I absolutely LOVE everything about this player. There were several factors I considered in buying an MP3 player. First, I wanted a player with sufficient space available. This has 1G and that is perfect for me. Secondly, it is so small! I like that I can wear it around my neck or on my arm. One of the biggest determining factors, though, was the fact that I can tape off of the radio. I wanted something with that versatility. I'm also happy with the fact that it only takes one battery. So I don't feel like I'm burning through batteries with it. In fact, I'm still on the first battery I put in there.This is the first MP3 player I've purchased. I shopped around and Amazon offered the best price anywhere. I couldn't be more happy with the choice I made and where I bought the product."
5,Great Little Toy,I love light weight and small size. Great alternative to iPod if you don't need the memory. The buttons weren't as difficult as some reviews make them out to be. I've had it for a month or so and just found the one drawback I don't like and hadn't read about. You can't move mp3's from the iRiver onto your computer. Some sort of copyright business. I pulled music off my friends computer in Sweden and then couldn't put it onto my computer once I returned home. Oh well. Still and awesome product.
4,My First MP3 Player,"Like so many, I did a good deal of research before settling on the 799T. I have to admit - I liked the ipod best at first. Then I realized it was all glitter and smart marketing. The iriver just does much more. Your not locked into one download source for music like with ipod. I did run into one glitch with this player, newer cd's wouldn't play on it using the iriver software to do the downloads. Finally after reading some of the chat boards, I discovered just using the sync mode in Windows Media player 10 I got around this problem. I still use the iriver software to keep everything in neat folders - works wonderful. The sound is fantastic and just as good if not better than the ipods I checked out. Strongly recommend this player!"
5,something different,This is the most interesting standards record yet. It's absolutely beautiful! Aaron Neville's vocal performances are extraordinary. His interpretations of these simple solid songs are like nothing else you've ever heard. The song selection is great and the new arrangements of these old songs are extremely cool! Especially Summertime and Who Will Buy. Impeccable sounding. This is one of the nicest cd's I've purchased in a long time. Very hip!
2,Very Disapointing,"Over the years, I have been a great fan of Aaron Neville, but I cannot recommend this CD. Sure there are some highlights (Summertime and The Shadow Of Your Smile), but most of the Cd seems to lack emotion.This Cd is not in the same league as Grand Tour or Tattoed Heart."
2,tight Voice weak material,to bad that Aaron Neville can't get Material to match His Vocal Depth.this album is a long line in plush Material that trys hard to smooth out Aaron Neville as to playing to His Gut-Bucket natural feel&Pressence.very middle of the road material.I'd really dig Hearing Aaron working with a Cat like Willie Mitchell the Producer behind all those Great Al Green Cuts.Albums like this aside from the vocals are a dime a dozen.
3,Linda AGAIN...ICKK!!,"PUhleezz, no more Linda! What possesses Aaron and his staff to offer repeat invites to Linda Ronstadt? Her gushy, over the top vocals are horribly unsuited to his powerful, delicate, understated style. Gad.This man does NOT need a partner. His voice renders with such poignance the lonely experience of being a simple human, awash in this world."
2,It is not one of his best albums.,"Aaron Neville has a beautiful and unique voice. I have enjoyed several of his albums, such as Warm Your Heart, Grand Tour, Tattooed Heart, Devotion, Soulful Christmas, and some others with his brothers. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy his renditions of ""The Great American Songbook"" songs included in this CD. Perhaps, the Jazz tempo and the mood in which he sings these songs were too different and slow for me. These beautiful songs are usually interpreted with a faster tempo by many singers.If you love the soul and R&B; style of Aaron Neville, I recommend you to preview this album before you buy it since you may not like the style he uses in this particular album. If you are not very familiar with Aaron Neville, I recommend Grand Tour, Tattooed Heart, and Devotion instead of this album."
5,Aaron....Like you have NEVER heard him before!!,"I am blown away by every song. The support from Rob Mounsey, Anthony Wilson, Ron Carter and Grady Tate is a team made in Jazz Heaven. It is Aaron at his best. all I can say is ""Thank you, Aaron""!"
5,Pleased,"Hard to find these large size hot pads. They are handy, durable, and multi functional. Worth the price. Arrived quickly. They smell from being packaged in plastic, but a few hours in the bright sunshine takes care of that. Use these and the smaller size daily beside my cooktop or in front of the microwave or on the dining table. They are thin and easy to store and easy to clean. They protect my beautiful custom wood counter top not just from hot pans, but also from scratches when I am mixing or blending. Love them!!Update: Over 3 years later and I still love these things. Look good as new and work great!!"
5,Silicone Counter Cover/Pad,We have a couple of these counter covers/pads. We keep one under our George Foreman grill when grilling with it! They are great for protecting your countertops and tables when removing items from the oven or stovetop. Smaller ones are great for moving hot pans/dishes from the oven...better hand protection than traditional cloth pot holders.
5,Does not conduct heat,Very thin and grips handles without slipping and without hotspots. I use primarily to remove pans from the oven and as a hotplate.
4,"Big HotSpot Silicone Counter Cover, Frosted",Love this product. I just wished that it was larger. I have the frosted cover so it blends in with my ugly counter top.
3,Not as stimulating as I thought,"I did not find this as nice as I thought, as the scenes don't change as often as you would like. I find it more interesting if the scenes are constantly random, but with this video you are seeing the same scene for minutes. The music is not bad."
1,Did not receive,"For some strange reason, I never received the product even though I was given a tracking number and the post office did have it on record. Fortunately, Amazon was graceful enough to refund my cash and I have no complaints for the establishment. I will attempt to shop Amazon again."
4,J. Mason,"There's a lot of NES games that don't stand the test of time very well and/or are just plain terrible games! This Gunsmoke game however is one of the better games on the NES and one of the best games I purchased on Amazon. I only test-played the first stage so far, but even from that I could tell that this game has great potential. I don't know if this game has anything to do with the t.v. western series ""GUNSMOKE""? I think it just has the same title, but I'm not sure. Boy, I sure wish there was a game based on the ""BONANZA"" t.v. series! That's my favorite."
4,Mesmerizing!!!!!,"One of the few modern novelists to adequately capture a new view of the mythology of the vampyre. As I quickly turned, page by page, I sunk deeper into the character of Byron until I finally felt that I had become him, feeling his desires and passions. Slowly I sat the book onto the table after I had finished and for a long while, felt that I had lived the story somehow. I haven't had that happen since reading Anne Rice. Truly superb!!!!"
2,"Fun, but unimaginatively mirrors Interview With the Vampire.","Though I enjoyed the read, Tom Holland needs to make his writing his own. This vampire story mirrored Interview. The characters were undeveloped, and it was a bit predicatable. The author does have a well developed tale, but hopefully future writings will be more original. For a first time book it was fairly enjoyable."
3,A GOOD READ BUT...,"I found Tom Holland to be a very good author and the book was captivating. His use of history entwind with his enchanting look at Lord Byron has you hooked from the get go. The book never dragged, and kept the reader motivated as to what was to become of poor Rebecca. The tragedy of the novel lies in it's ending or should I say the lack there of. The ending was so abrupt that it left the reader wondering what is to happen, obviuosly Rebecca can not live she knows too much. Does Lord Byron go after her and kill her? Make her into a vampire (doubtfull)? or does haidee finally feed? All too confusing to the reader, but it does seem like a good set up for a follow up book, which is perhaps the reason the author chose to end the book this way. Either way it is worth the time it takes to read."
4,What if Byron really were a vampire....,"I throroughly enjoyed this book. Holland blends the idea (widely held in the 19th century) that the ""Vampyre"" of Poliodori's story was in fact Byron with interesting facts of Byron's life, and adds a helping of fanstasy and conjecture. Well-written and a cut above the average vampire fare."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"I was so disappointed with this book. I felt it to be a conglomeration of Stoker's Dracula and Rice's Interview With The Vampire, with little new or original material. The only redeeming feature of the book is the strange history of Byron."
2,"Vampire, Byron Style","This was a rather tedious book with little captivating appeal. It gives the account of Lord Byron, ala Interview with the Vampire, and his travels throughout various European countries, 'finding himself'. I thought the writing was disjointed as it didn't seem to flow well. The biggest question I found myself constantly asking was ""Who cares?"". Although Lord Byron is now celebrity status, I never felt drawn or attached to any of the characters to really cared what happened to them.For those people who are fans of Lord Byron, I suspect you probably will like the book and find it entertaining. Maybe that was the whole point and I just missed it. However, for the rest of us, this was just a ho-hum kind of tale."
2,The Rakes Regress,More likely L.B. became an accomplished pedaphile after meeting the Pasha than a Vampire- As usual he is the victim of silliness rather than madness.But I do love all things Byronic so. . .
2,Not Impressed,"A word of caution to the propective reader of ""Lord of the Dead"". Byron and most of the other vampires in this chilling tale ""play from both sides of the field"", ""go both ways"", or can be considered ""open-minded"""
1,Nancy Vampire,"Why choose Lord Byron of all historical figures to turn into a vampire, that would be appropriate if you wanted your vampire to be that kind that wears ruffles and drinks tea, and has bosoms heaving and talks endlessly about the moonlight and death eternal and blah blah blah, cmon, Anne Rice has already written the definitive vampire novel including those things, But in a better way with a better story line. This book was fluff, and not the kind you combine with peanut butter it was fluff that fills pillows so as to put you to sleep."
2,"Dull, dull an OH!!! Dull","I was very excited when my brother told me about this series. After all, its post apocolyptic and there are a ton of books in the series. Unfortunately the book, although competently written, is terribly boring. Characters are flat and utterly lame. I won't be dipping into this well again."
2,Cheaper to buy at Home Depot,"This is just rock climbing rope with small knots at the end. Not bad, but simple. Could easily have made myself. I do like the color though."
4,Always a pleasure,I like all of the books in this series. Alot of story and not full of sex. A little romance - just enough.
3,"Rushed, but a decent thriller","While I've read the Thurlos' novels featuring the half-vampire police office Leo Hawk/Lee Nez before, this book feels rushed. The plot moves so quickly that there's little description of places and the characters, save Lee and his lover, Diane, are merely ciphers. The book does have an interesting plot concering US government experiments on vampires and how that leads to Lee and Diane chasing a full vampire who's turned serial killer through the cities of New Mexico."
5,Reissued,"Save your money and don't purchase an out-of-print copy--this is about to be reissued on CD. I haven't heard the performance but rated it since that was required for me to provide any information on Amazon's site. However, these performers are terrific and it's unlikely it deserves fewer than five stars."
5,Funky and Charming!,This book is one of those rare combinations of a sensitive and engaging story complemented by equally compelling illustrations. Walrod's illustrations jump out of book with funky perspectives and a masterful use of color and texture. She interprets this very good story about individuality and freindship in a way that balances an important message with a style that produces so many fun (and funny) things to look at that kids (and parents)will have a hard time putting it down
4,The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble With Friends,"This book is good for the age rage from 3-6 years, who are just making friends at school and in their neighboorhood.Sister bear has Lizzy move in next door and they become friends, and learn that sometimes friends have fights, but that a friend is good to have despite their differences.This book teaches kids that even when friends have differences and fights they need to overcome their differences and still be friends."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My mother purchased this for me as a Christmas gift. It lasted perhaps 3 months before the wood on the bottom of the rack, where the ""legs"" attach, simply gave way and smashed. The rack was NOT over-loaded with heavy items, either. I tried wood-gluing it back together, and that held for approximately another month. Now, it came crashing down again and I've finally decided to give up on this piece of crap.Yes, it's an inexpensive item and yes - aesthetically - its a very attractive wood coat rack. However, the wood and the construction are not sufficient to perform the job that you expect it to perform."
3,"The Message, Burgundy Bonded Leather","I was very dissappointed with the size of this book. I purchased it as a gift for someone and was embarrased when they called to tell me that they received it and said that it was smaller than an envelope and the print was too small to read. I have the Message and love the contents, but this was not what I thought I was ordering."
2,Difficult to navigate.,"There is no simple way to find a passage, so I can't use it anywhere. If you want to read this like a book, starting at the beginning, no jumping around, it is a good read, a really fun translation. But don't bring this one with you to a Bible Study and think you can navigate it in a timely fashion."
2,Simplistic,OK if you want a quick read through difficult sections of the OT. However other books aren't even recognizable if you're used to the KJ translation. Psalms and Proverbs particularly. I would recommend this translation to someone with a low reading level who wanted to know the basics of Christianity.
5,The message,I like the message a lot. I use it at church along with my NIV Study guide. The wording is a little different but the same meaning. Its the new generation version.
5,The best Bible for daily devotions.,We use this Bible for our daily devotions because it is written in today's language and helps us understand what we are meant to take away from our scripture reading. The Message is excellent and we have been giving it as gifts to our friends.
1,A Perversion of God's Holy Word,"The Message is clearly and by far a perversion of God's holy and true Word. It's almost as if Eugene Peterson sat down one night realizing that he personally thought God's Holy Word was boring so he decided to pervert it by ""spicing"" it up with his terrible paraphrases and ""translations"" which makes this ""bible"" the most off-based and far from the original translation. He uses excellent descriptor words (notice the sarcasm) such as hocus pocus and 3 uses of the word potatoes (2 relating to something that is not a big worry) (he must have been a previous farmer in Idaho). Do not buy this book if you have any sort of reverance for God's true Word at all. I'm not sure where he went with this one, but if you want a good translation to easily understand go with the NIV, or if you want the closest renderings to the actual greek and hebrew, go with my favorite--the NASB."
4,"Refreshing to read, but *not* the word of God","The Message is a great idea, and should be a welcome addition to every Christian's bookshelf. It is not, however, a true bible. The Message contains every book of the bible, and divides the books up in chapters, just like any bible. From here though, it is differs, in that each chapter is a paraphrase of its namesake in the bible. The chapters are not broken up into individual verses, and are generally of shorter length than chapters from the bible.Also, because the chapters are paraphrased, the Message loses some of the strength of a true bible, as Peterson is forced to make interpretations about some sections.Despite this, the chapters remain quite true to the bible, and the Message provides a refreshing, if somewhat simplified read.Just remember that this book is not the bible, just a great study tool to be used with it."
1,The message is a great version of the Bible and a great price too!,"Well, Amazon.com has done it again. I purchased The Message and was pleased that the price was so reasonable and it is such a wonderful way to review passages from the Bible in today's language. I use it all the time and think it is much more easy for youth and children to understand the concepts in the Bible. The old fashioned way of the King James version of the Bible was for then, and The Message is for now. A great purchase!"
1,"Pagan New Age Emergent Interpretation of ""Scripture""","Run from this insane new age interpretation of scripture. Is it any wonder why the emergent church is leading so many astray when this garbage interpretation of ""scripture"" is taught from the pulpit, let alone sold as a BIBLE translation?People, do your homework before you read this nonsense perspective of so called scripture. Stick to King James or New American Standard."
2,Not What I Thought,"The Message itself is just fine. It arrived coming loose from its binding. It was afterwards I was advised that the ""warehouse"" sells damaged goods, and I was basically stuck with it.Let the buyer beware..."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!,It might be a great bible if you can read it. I bought three of them to give to some friends who are under the age of 40. They had trouble reading the small print. There should be a disclaimer or an included magnifying glass.
3,The Message,"The item arrived in the good condition listed. The problem is that there are no verse numbers in this edition. For a bible, even a contemporary one, this creates an item not as usable as it should be. I feel that should have been disclosed in the listing. Otherwise it arrived quickly and in good condition."
2,Bible comments,"I was disappointed as this Bible has no verse nuimbers in it. If you want to go to Book, Chapter and verse you cannot identify the verse in this book. I would not recommend it."
4,Good Job,"This was an excellent buy - a very well-crafted gift for a young man being confirmed. Personally, I like the New English Bible, and as I am a 66-year-old Episcopalian I have an ingrained fondness for the King James Bible and the accompanying prayer book."
4,Good Book to Use With the Bible,"This is an electronic copy of the Message. I had already been using a hard copy of ""The Message"". I like this version of the Bible to use along with a more traditional Bible."
2,Not configured for kindle,I have The Message in hard copy and the previous reading on kindle. This new one may have verse numbers but I can't seem to find the chapter index. So I have to page my way to Psalms 51 which needs commitment. Let's hope a new release comes out with this rectified.
1,this version of The Message is disappointing,"This version of The Message (and it's not about the ""message"") is that the print is so very small that even young eyes cannot read it. It's small and compact...so if you'd like to use it for travel, that would be good. But, if you're intending to use this in a more public setting and for study the print size is a handicap. Unfortunately, that was my plan and had ordered (and planned to order more) multiple copies which I had to return."
3,Good version for devotional reading; not serious Bible study,"This version of the Bible is, in my opinion, good only for leisurely reading. The lack of verse numbers allows the reader to continue reading and not lose their train of thought. When it says, ""contemporary language,"" that's exactly what you will get. I would rate the readability of ""The Message"" on an eighth or ninth grade reading level.This version is a paraphrase; it only puts forth the idea of what the Scripture passage is conveying. But be cautious: like other paraphrases I have read in the past, the thing to remember is that the translator's beliefs and doctrines are usually interjected into the translation.I would never recommend ""The Message"" for serious Bible study; NIV, KJV, or even the English Standard Version are better choices for study. But as far as easy reading, ""The Message"" is a good choice."
3,Not good for a main Bible,"The author interjects his own opinion sometimes in his paraphrase which changes the whole meaning of the verse. It's sort of like cliff notes, but a lot longer. Serious Bible study needs a translation more dedicated to the original."
5,The Message,"I waited a while before placimpng an order for The Message to make sure it was the exact translation I had heard of. I had to look a good while to find the leather binding, but this one surpassed my expectations! I really have enjoyed it."
4,The Message,I was dissappointed with the size of the Bibles. Maybe I had missed that in the ad. All else was fine.
3,The Message Bible,The Bible itself is wonderful. The only problem is that the print is REALLY small.
1,very very small print; no verse numbers,Had to return this as it contained no verse numbers and the print was quite small -- less than a 10 point font.
5,Just what I wanted! This book is great.,I am very happy with the Message Bible in large print. It is easy to read and easy to digest. I have several Bibles and this is by far my favorite. Keeps me reading.
3,learning the Bible,"I am trying to learn the Bible. The Message is OK, but I do better with the NIV Bible.I now feel that a ""Bible dictionary"" would help me more."
5,The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language by Eugene H.,"Growing up in the church, I am used to the language of King James and the terminology within it, but my husband is a new Christian and feels overwhelmed by the thought of daily study when he has no idea what he is reading. This book has really been a blessing. Even I am seeing things in scriptures I never saw before because it is presented in the language I speak every day. We translate the Bible into so many languages, why not contemporary english? The only way to leave the text completely in the original wording is for all of us to learn Hebrew and Greek. A great tool for anyone who wants to understand God more."
3,the small of the great of it,"I love this version for easy reading, but it was very surprising that the bible was SO SMALL as to fit in my one hand, and the print is very tiny also. I had expected a more regular size of book and type."
3,Buyer Beware,"I received my copy today. A beautifully leather bound book. But, the print was so small that I could not focus my eyes to read it. I don't believe Amazon's description of the book includes its dimensions.You may want to search for a copy with larger print."
5,"""The Message"" by Eugene Peterson",A good read. Takes all the mystery and confusion out of reading the scriptures. Just like reading a good novel. Give it a try.
4,"The Bible as we know it in refreshing, TODAY lingo BUT CLOSE TO UN NAVIGATE ABLE BETWEEN REFERENCES!","The Bible as we know it in refreshing, TODAY lingo.BOUGHT but do not recommend THE KINDLE EDITION BUT FOUND IT VIRTUALLY UN-NAVIGATE-ABLE ON THE IPAD. clumsy search functions and absent Headers to show which book of the bible the page belongs to.First the KJV, then the Living Bible, then the CEV, then RSVNext comes NIV, NJKV and NApplicationB, Amplified then NLTHaving gone through all, the sun rises still a little moreand gives us the Message Bible.There has been some criticism on some of the terminologies used in this bible but hvg said that it has also opened up the verses and unlocked a whole new understanding and perspective for us using everyday language in today's context. Easily understood. Lights up the nooks and crannies missed till now.Refreshing. Nourishing. Enlivening."
4,"The Message, and awesome Bible","I have enjoyed reading from the book of Luke, since it is the Christmas season. The Message makes it easier to understand the Bible so much better. It is more of a storyline."
5,A helpful gift.,"A friend told me she always wanted to read the Bible, but the language was too difficult to understand.I gave her a copy of the Message, and she is reading history every day!"
2,Very small edition,"My mother in law asked for The Message as a Christmas gift. I ordered this and received it, then realizing how small it is. It is a compact version. She was thrilled, but as I feared, the print was too small for her to comfortably read. I will go to a bookstore to repurchase this book in a more readable version."
2,The aMessage Rocks,"I enjoyed reading this book. I have alwys been interested in understanding the Bible. The original trnaslations are difficult to understand so the rewrite in easier to understnad language is a great help.I find the detailed descriptions well-written. I would highly recommend this text to anyone interested in understanding the Bible. Now, perhaps I can finish reading this wonderful book in my lifetime!!Linda deBaun"
1,This is NOT the Bible!,"Rather, it is more like what Eugene Peterson thinks the Bible says. As such it is a commentary rather than a Bible. Unfortunately, it is sold as a Bible, thus only one star from this reviewer. If the marketing was more honest, it would get a better rating.Admittedly, I didn't read the whole thing. But I read enough vs. New Jerusalem, NIV, and an interlinear Bible to realize this is a STRANGE translation.Other reviewers have done a good job of chronicling the many questionable, if not outright errant, translations in this work so I won't repeat them here.If you are interested in Peterson's opinions, go out and buy it. But do not use this, or any of the other awful Biblical paraphrases out there as your study Bible, or for liturgical readings, or for use in a Sunday School presentation, or (heaven forbid) a sermon. Use a real Bible for that!"
2,Missing pages,"The book is lovely,but unfortunately pages 25 - 128 are missing. I would like to know how to replace it. It is enjoyable to be able to compare this version of the Bible with other versions."
1,The Bible says???,"I have been reading ""The Purpose Driven Life"" by Rick Warren, who often quotes this very loose paraphrase, preceded by the words ""The Bible says."" I have been comparing what ""The Message"" says to what the Bible actually says; and in the majority of instances they are not even close. What Eugene H. Peterson says may or may not be true, but to call this the Bible is not accurate. This is one person's interpretation of the Bible. I am a seminary graduate. I have studied Greek and Hebrew. I can say without reservation that this is NOT a translation from the original languages."
1,"Message Bible, The","The Bible was returned. It was written like a novel instead of a Bible. There were no Scriptural numbers, etc. It was very hard to follow, and it was such a small print, that it was even harder to follow.I cannon in all honesty recommend it.Sincerely,John T. Robinson, D.MinALMS Pastor"
4,purchase of The Message,"This book was a gift for my husband, who does comparative study of different translations of the Bible. The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
4,more for reading than study,"I gave this as a gift. Though it uses every-day English, the person was disappointed that it did not show the numbers for each verse.I would recommend this for leisure reading rather than for Bible Study."
3,Tlhe Message: a contemporary version of the Bible,"This version of the Bible is easily understood. I am very disappointed, however, in the very dim print, which makes it difficult for old eyes to see. It is also hard to determine verses."
5,"The Message Bible, pocketsize",There's not much to say about it. It's small and it's the message Bible. It's just what I wanted!
4,Message,I was well pleased with the purchase of the Message. The only thing I didn't care for was the pages were too thin. I like to write in the books and highlight and you can see thru to the next page. Otherwise it was fine.
5,easy listening,"The Message on cd is read by an American male voice, easy to listen to and very natural sounding. It is easy to use because each chapter is a new track. The intros are read by an English sounding female voice. I chose this version of the Bible on cd because the man who reads it was the most natural sounding in comparison to other audio-Bibles."
5,Love this paraphrase,"For days when you are so caught up with life's stuff that you can't even concentrate, this version of the Bible speaks volumnes"
2,Bible Reviewed,I was disappointed with the Message Bible I purchased. The print was way too small. I had to return to the Serendipity Bible I had been using after having a hard time reading the Message Bible.
3,I lilke it but it it isnt really for a Kindle usless you have touch,I love the Message Bible. Had been meaning to by one for me e-sword but thought this would work for my kindle. It doesnt unless you planning to page for ever. You can't go to specific chapter verse. If I had touch screen that would help but even on my laptop it takes a lot of scrolling to get the passage you want.
5,Excellent translation,Great way to look at the bible from a modern perspective. Great addition to any biblical collection. Would recommend reading both King James and this side by side.
4,My Study,When studing the Bible sometimes I need more a book like the (message) that is put in our modern language to get a better understanding.
3,The print is too small!!!,I had to return it. The print is too small. The description should note that somewhere but it doesn't
3,Not what I expected.,"The Bible print is very small. (I figured that was a result of the small price.) The Books are numbered, but he verses are not. Example: John 3:13. You have to read the whole Third verse & then guess which one is number 13."
1,Do Not Bother with the Kindle edition,I was afraid the Kindle edition would be difficult to read but I did not heed my gut feeling. I should have. The book is not searchable. Or at least in any way I have found. It's great if you want to start in Genesis and read it like a novel.Anyway I can get my $14 back?
2,The Message Eugene Petersen,I first went to the King James and was thrilled to see how easy it was to use it on my brandnew Kindle. I decided to rather buy The Message and immediatly got the trial copy. There is no way I can use it. I cannot click on different locations and be zapped there in a nanosecond. So i will have to wait until The Message catches up with the latest technology.
2,The Message by Eugene Peterson,"""The Message"" is a paraphrase of the Bible. It is easy to read and understand; however, readers should be cautioned that this is one author's interpretation. ""The Message is not THE BIBLE and is marketed as a paraphrase. This is also not a verse by verse paraphrase but rather a chapter by chapter look at how Eugene Peterson interprets the scripture. Therefore, it changes the meaning of scripture that is conveyed in trusted translations of the BIBLE."
2,Not as Expected,I ordered this message bible and thought it was a larger print bible. It didn't say it was a small print one. Could hardly read it. I gave one to my grandson and he couldn't see the print either. I didn't send it back just decided to keep it.
1,Hard to read when the pages aren't there.,"This was sold as like new, which it was, however ,there are about 30 chapters missing from the book of Genesis. I have not gone through any other books yet. I am so disappointed with this purchase. And now it is on me to deal with returning and requesting a refund."
1,Never again!,I received the Bible in a timely manner and was pleased about that. BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BIBLE UP IT SMELLED OF CIGARETTE SMOKE! IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!
5,"Best ""Reading"" Bible Available Today!","Every Christian needs at least two Bibles versions, one for study and one for reading. While the New International Version is still the best choice for study, The Message is now the best choice for devotional reading. It belongs on every believer's bookshelf.The Message is not a translation, but a paraphrase. A paraphrase is not as accurate as a translation, but is much easier to read and to understand. The Living Bible is a tremendously popular paraphrase of the past. After decades of use however, it has become dated and is now difficult to find. The Message is clearly its successor for the English-speaking church.With the plethora of study Bibles on the market today, it is easy to get lost in all of the notes, graphs, charts and other helps. As a result, one can lose the joy of just READING the Bible. Study Bibles with all their helps play an important role, but for simply reading God's Word devotionally ""The Message"" is by far the best choice."
1,This shouldn't be called a bible,"This bible is a mistranslation luring christians into new age thinking and preparing them for a world religion. It mistranslates the lords prayer. It even uses new age terminology. Don't read this bible, if you own it throw it out. I urge you to please take me seriously. I'm only 15 and realize the deception in this book. If you compare the verses in this bible to other translations you will see it too. The only message this bible is teaching is the new age message."
1,Only Bible stories,"Remember that Eugene Peterson, not God, is the author of The Message. It is based on the Bible, but it is not The Bible. Unfortunately, people believe that it is. It is actually well beyond a paraphrase. It is, unfortunately, now being quoted everywhere one goes, and in books, sermons, etc. I have read that the author himself, Peterson, is somewhat distressed that people are taking it as an actual Bible translation. I think it wise to heed the author's distress. Make a wise choice of a formal equivalent Bible translation in modern English, such as NASB, ESV, HCSB. There you will be getting the Scriptures themselves."
5,Message Bible,My daughter wanted a bible that was very easy to read and understand. It was a gift for Christmas and she loved it very much. I myself have one and I love it.
5,"""The Message""","This interpretation of the Bible is wonderful! I recommend ""The Message"" by Eugene Peterson to every person.It would make a great christmas present."
5,There's Fresh Bread Here,"At last, it's here, the whole Bible in the Message paraphrase! I have no complaints except that I often wish Peterson had used verse numbers. Yes, the Message is intended to be read as the Bible was read long ago, but verse numbers do give the journey some ""mile markers"". I like to read the Message side by side with a standard translation and it can be a little akward finding the place, but so well worth the effort.Peterson's paraphrase is a labor of love, and I'm so very thankful he has completed this work.Contrary to what some might imagine, this work does not ""dumb down the Bible"", but rather Peterson uses the language of our day, much as the Bible was first recorded - in everyday street language. I'm sure some scholars may well have fits over real or imagined translation and contextual errors, but the world shall go on.I highly recommend this paraphrase to anyone who wants or needs a fresh look at this sacred text."
2,Better in actual hardback,"I have The Message on my Kindle Fire and in Hardback. I like reading this translation/interpretation/what-have-you of the Bible. However it's a pain to find a specific passage in the Kindle edition. Links to books are near the beginning, so I have to ""flip"" to the beginning, ""flip"" to the contents, click on a book, then ""flip"" to the chapter I want to read. Links to chapters within the books would be helpful and appreciated."
2,Inadequate table of contents,I ordered the Kindle edition of the The Message. The table of contents did not go beyond the specific books of the Bible. There is no way to go to chapters in the books without turning page by page which is not practical. I asked for and received a refund.
5,Nice size print,The size of this bible is between a personal and regular one with very easy to read type. I love the wording in the Message Bible and it is great for bible study or just comparison reading on your own.
2,Small print,"The product did not come up to my expectations. The print was too small. My wife and I are in our 80s and don't have the vision we once had for these things. Sorry, I returned the item and was credited."
5,Excellent,"I have changed my mind about this book. As a long time believer and reader of the Bible, I was initially reluctant to even look at this new translation. But during an unrelated course I was taking, we used this version and the words jumped out at me and came alive, they really did.Then I read the Revelation at the end and must say it was the clearest version I have ever read - almost completely understandable, for a very hard to understand book.Most of my life I read the New International Version as it was from my time and the old King James was just too difficult to follow, like reading Shakespeare or something.So I heartily recommend this book to all readers, especially those who have found previous versions of the Bible hard to follow. Good job !"
1,BEWARE-This is NOT God's Word-It is Deceiving,"The book is just another tool in the hands of Satan. Peterson has done what God warns all who read His Word not to do at the end of the Bible in Revelation and also in the Old Testament, in other words, not to add or delete ANY of His Word. This man does just that. I would urge all who are considering buying this to stop and NOT buy it. It is leading to false beliefs and even calling this ""The Message Bible"" is FALSE. God's Word is not something to be taken lightly or changed to suit your purposes or to make it ""easy to understand"" . If you really want to understand the Bible, pick up a REAL Bible: King James, ESV, NIV, but NOT this utter distortion which will lead you astray. This is FALSE, FALSE, FALSE. Buy a real Bible and ask the Lord to open its meaning up to you."
3,Can't Tell A Book By It's Cover! (MISREPRESENTED!),"I have this Bible BUT the one I have is exactly like the one they SHOW on here ONLY THIS IS NOT THE ONE YOU GET! MISREPRESENTED! This Bible was a gift to my sister, I had it sent directly to her. She can't even see the print to read it! I had no idea the Bible I bought for her was this small with such tiny print. I had to send her another one (the bigger one!) I just think it's WRONG to display a picture of something that is being sold but not what your getting! SHOW THE BIBLE YOUR SELLING!!! I went back and Read the reviews, I was not the only one fooled by this!"
1,Kindle Edition,"I regret this purchase. Simply put, it's ridiculous that there is no way to search for a book in the bible, nor a way to click on a table of contents, because there isn' t a table of contents. Shame on me for not reading the relevant reviews prior to purchase."
3,Small print,"I don't think I realized the print was so small in this edition. Would suggest the non-leather bound version if you want to actually read it. It's good for carrying around, and if you have good eyesight, it reads well. I'm no expert as to its accuracy, and sometimes the language doesn't flow as elegantly as in some (another good one is the English Standard Version) -- but well worth exploring. Note there are no verse numbers as it is intended to read like a book. Now there's a concept -- treat the Bible like a book."
3,Pastor,Print difficult to read.Not as hyped as advertised.Not sure it will serve the purpose it was intended to.
1,pages too thin and too hard to read print,This book is entirely too hard to read. Print is too light and pages are too thin. I made a big mistake buying this Bible.
2,Too small,"I own this book for myself and I think it is awesome! But, when I ordered this as a gift for someone else, I was surprised at how small the print was. I ended up returning it and ordering a different edition."
2,Too hard to navigate kindle version,"'The Message' is a great compliment to standard translations, but the Kindle version is not user friendly. The table of contents or search function does not allow you to go to an individual book for the purpose of study. Other Kindle versions of the Bible (like the NASB) have this feature, so I'm not sure why 'The Message' is set up differently. I returned this version and purchased 'The Message 2.0' thinking it was an upgrade, but still no ability to select an individual book (like Philippians). You just have to guess at page numbers until you get close."
3,The Message Numbered Edition,"This Message Bible was not easy to navigate on my Kindle Fire HD. Initially I could not find the books. I had to search for individual books and scriptures. After a couple of weeks I ""accidentally"" found the ""contents"" page. Once I Bookmarked it, it became visible on my ""Go to..."" search. Now I only wish that there was an indicator to tell you what book you were in as you turned the pages within the books. Who uses ""Locations""?"
2,"Love it, but easily broken.","It was exactly as described, and fit one of my fingers really well. It shipped fast, and I was really pleased at how gorgeous it was.I had previously purchased one except that it was thicker. I wore it for a while, about a few months or so, until it broke. I had slapped my hand down on the concrete, and it just crumbled to pieces. My boss remarked at how fragile hematite was, and I had never realized that. So, I suppose I shouldn't have purchased one in the first place. But I think they're really pretty.The quality, however, isn't all that great. I purchased this one (my second one), and it broke later that night, actually cutting my finger and I still have a very small shard imbeded into my skin. :\It's pretty, I like it, but it's SO fragile."
5,what a great deal!!!,"This is a great ring. Nice weight, true to size and really nice colouring. I was worried that it would be flimsy since it was so inexpensive, but it's not.Another plus is that the shipping was so fast! Win-Win-WIN!!"
5,I love it!,"The ring is true to size and very thick and durable. I will note that as with any stone jewelry, be careful notto ever drop it on hard surfaces. The ring is beautiful and I am very happy with this purchase!"
2,"Looks Nice, but didn't hold up...","The ring looks very nice, but the quality is not so nice. This was the second time I have purchased this ring for my husband. He is a man that talks with his hands, both times he was pointing to something on a table and voila, the ring broke into many pieces. Needless to say we are going to get a quality metal this time. If you are gentle with your hands, this ring may work. It is a nice looking ring, but you get what you pay for."
3,Gemstone Ring,This was a great ring and the price was right. The only thing that I can tell you we be careful with it. My job is more hand on and after four or five month one day the ring cracked. It broke into several piece. I was the ring or the companys fault but more tha my job is a little more physical then most so... for the normal guy it's a great ring and the price is right....
4,Cool ring!,"The ring is as advertised, although you won't know just how cool it looks (a shifting silver/grey/black) until you see one in person. If it was a little wider it would be perfect."
2,not so good,"i got this for my husband after he lost his wedding band. at first it was really nice and he got a lot of compliments. about a month after getting it he was at practice for Honor Guard doing movements on a rifle. He tapped his hand against the rifle and the ring shattered.I also got myself one which i do still have, but do not wear. It hasn't broken because i don't work with my hands, but the appearance isn't very good anymore. It starts to get prints all over it that just won't come off."
5,Great for allergies,"Love this ring! It's a very nice, shiny black -- and a true black, unlike most rings sold on here -- ring that works great for anyone with allergies. I tend to have problems wearing most metal rings, but this one has been great so far. It's also fine to wash, and it won't change color."
5,Hematite Genuine Gemstone 6 MM Band Ring Size 7.5,"The ring was totally as described, shipped to us really fast, and with most excellent presentation."
2,for a toddler,"I wish i had seen the other reiview before i bought it ,it is definatly for a toddler not a""big boy"".My son likes it but he is turning five and will need a bigger one."
4,durable dream,"Moviola is a refreshing move toward the emblematic sounds of Columbus, Ohio. An original sound that deserves national airplay. It is only a matter of time before the rest of the world catches on to Moviola. There crisp vocals and tight musicianship,accompanied by strong lyrics endear them to the fans of the local music scene in Columbus who know what's happening. Moviola is a breath of fresh air waiting to be swallowed."
1,this seller is unreliable-Natural Health Shoppe,"Do not order anything from this vendor (Natural Health Shoppe ). Shipments run long and delivery dates are inaccurate. I am still waiting for my product to ship and it has already passed the estimated delivery date. I have contacted them via Amazon, and they never responded."
4,An excellent investment of time....,"I have never been a huge fan of poetry; however, when I found out I was going to have the opportunity to meet Julia Alvarez at a reception I was planning, I read this book. It is thoroughly engaging and every time I picked it up I had a hard time putting it back down. If the eyes are the windows to someone's soul, these poems are Ms. Alvarez's virtual eyes for us to gaze into. In closing, if you have an opportunity to attend a reading with Ms. Alvarez, I highly recommend it."
2,Not so good,The author writes about the Dominion Republic very well but her poems are not so good. They are more like good prose strung together in lines. I read two of her other books which were great. In the Time of Butterflies and Saving the World. Actually I really highly recommend Saving the World by Alvarez.
1,Not for Me,The poems are not of a subject matter that I could relate to so they did not speak to my heart. I should have realized it would not be a good poetry book for me based on the person who recommended it to me. Oh well. What's a little more money wasted that I don't have?
3,CONTENTS OF HALLOWEEN 2002,"As per the distributor, Elite Entertainment, this DVD boxed set includes 4 classic horror movies: ""Inseminoid"", ""Tower Of Evil"", ""Curse Of The Voodoo"", and ""Horror Hospital""."
4,Leviton remote switch,"Beware: the product information competely omits mention of the remote switch that is necessary. The implication is that the only other thing you might need would be the transmitter, so that is what I ordered, but this is not true. In fact I have to return the transmitter, and I am finding it impossible to find information on the remote switch, which is the item I actually need."
5,Great Pilates Workout!,"This is a fantastic workout! Carly's DVD keeps you interested throughout the entire video and all of the exercises are easy to follow whether you are a beginner or an advanced practitioner. Carly really knows her stuff, this is true Pilates and you will see results!"
4,As pictured,Received earrings exactly as pictured and described. Very true red. The wires seem a little flimsy but they're holding up for me. They make a bold addition.
4,see bracelet,"deeper red than in picture, high quality for money, see bracelet. Store never disapoints, fast, classy and for the price you can't beat it."
5,love,can't believe how inexpensive these are - love them - great value! i wear them all the time no problems.
5,Beautiful uniform red color,"I have been wearing Silver Speck earrings for 5 months and have been very impressed with the quality for the price; when I've bought jewelry from Wal-Mart or Target for a higher price than these, I've had earrings tarnish or break within a couple of wearings. Not so with Silver Speck! My mom wears a lot of red, so I bought these earrings for her for Christmas. The pair I received is redder in person than it looks in the photo, and there is less variation in color than shown in the photo. They are beautiful and I am very pleased with them."
4,More than expected,"I bought this remote for my Viking gate opener. The quality of build is not the best, but the remote works flawlessly. The only downside is that it breaks apart if dropped (cheap plastic), yet it always goes back together and works!At this price I bought 5. Can't go wrong."
5,TRANSFORMERS RULE,THIS TOY IS FREAKING AWESOME. THE ROBOT MODE TO CAR MODE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT. KINDA CHALLENGING TO TRANSFORM AT FIRST BUT YOU WILL GET THE HANG OF IT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE FOR EITHER A TRANSFORMER COLLECTOR OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTS A COOL TOY.
4,Alternators = realistic looking cars and robots,"The first thing that sticks out when looking at an alternator transformer is, whether or not you're looking at a model car, or a transforming robot. The detail were put into these toys, enough so to make them 1/24 models and they're still a toy!the Side Swipe car looks like a Viper. Logos and all.Though having him as a Ferrari (enzo?) would have been better.The next car which is coming out is the Ford Mustang.The car looks better, and the robot mode looks steller. Only problem with that, is the name, they picked Grimlock for the Mustang GT! Thus again, showing the only flaw with the Alternators. Though, they did a great job with Hound, matching him up with a Jeep Wrangler.Overall, this toy is great looking, and is made more for show, than for handling (toy use).Also the color variants (they're out there) also make nice collector pieces."
5,The Best One Yet From The Paladins,"This it what you have been waiting for.Great Jazzy sound,great drums,great bass and singing. This is the best Paladins cd yet, and i have to say buy it. I am 12 and trust me this cd is good ,really good and if you like non heavy rockabilly,blues,and a bit of jazz this is it. BUT IT"
1,Not a good installation of the Monster Rancher Series,"Monster Rancher Evo is an abomination in the Monster Rancher series. The game is filled with annoying twitch mini-games for circus, and you can't really progress in the story line or with your monsters unless you do them. I bought the game because I loved Monster Rancher, Monster Rancher 2, Monster Rancher 3 and Monster Rancher 4. I like raising my monsters, breeding them, exploring with them, and battling with them, etc. I do not like twitch games. While the rpg aspects of this game in the walk around portion was fun, it really lacked the fun of the previous 4 games because it didn't focus enough on the strengths of the previous games. This game was such a disappointment to me. I would have given it no stars, but amazon doesn't have that option. If you're buying this because you liked the previous 4 games, or you like simulation games, you will be disappointed."
1,They dropped the ball on this 1,this game is far from what monster rancher should be. I think that the mini games are complacated and not very rewarding.the thing that I hated the most is the very hands off training. If you like monster rancher avoid this game.
5,"Wonderful, moody piano music","Deceptively simple folk-melodies that I've listened to countless times over the past two decades. The best comparison is to the original piano version of Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" (1874) -- which, curiously, was inspired by paintings by Viktor Hartmann (no known relationship).I couldn't really say how long I've owned this album -- I have the vinyl LP, copyright 1987 and may well have bought it used. 20 years, at a guess. A good long-term investment.Gurdjieff collaborated with fellow-Russian de Hartmann in the 1920s to compose a piano repertory with roots in Caucasian and Central Asian folk and religious music, Russian Orthodox liturgical music, and other sources. Pianist Elan Sicroff met Mme. de Hartmann in 1975 and learned some of the Gurdjieff - de Hartmann oeuvre from her. This recording was made in 1985. I recommend it most highly.Happy listening--Peter D. Tillman"
3,Decent EP,"I loved refused's masterpiece The shape of punk to come(who doesn't). that album was one of the most original albums without actually creating a genre. Anyway i had high hopes that this album would be as good. it isn't. however its not bad. Everlasting and i am not me are especially good. However the first two tracks aren't as strong as rest. I like it better than Songs to fan the flames of discontent and it is better than the 'new' hardcore that i have heard. there are lots of tempo changes, harmonic lead lines and other complexities. i would recommend Shape of punk to come to anyone and everlasting to anyone who likes hardcore."
1,Very disapointing,"I had great expectation for this DVD due to the great reviews..... What a disappointment. The first 10 min are absolute filler, the sex posses are o.k., however between them or almost every 30sec to 1 min, the camera is showing sex experts talking about the posses. One guy in his late 60 and 2 women in their 60+ probably -not faces or interruptions you want to see when you're trying to be romantic. The actors are not very pleasant to look at, one of the actresses has a big scar of c-section on her lower abdomen .... I can keep going with negative things to say, but nothing positive. I have no idea who will enjoy this movie, maybe a very inexperienced lovers or an elderly people. Horrible! Don't waste your money."
1,Poorly designed,I found it difficult to insert coins into the slots without forcing them. It was extremely difficult to replace the protection sleeves without damaging the pages.
5,Incredible CD - Incredible Value,"This is another of the forgotten shows that Sepia Records has brought back to life. The music and lyrics are wonderful, and the transfer is absolutely superb as are all of the Sepia recordings. The bonus material is incredible as well. I've been told that another issue of MANHATTAN TOWERS is around that doesn't have nearly the same amount of music on it. Where else can you get a CD that has close to 80 minutes of music on it and not pay a fortune? I'm quickly becoming a huge fan of Sepia Records because of their re-release of shows like this and wonderful scores like MAKE A WISH and HAZEL FLAGG that have disappeared as well. Check out Bette Davis in TWO'S COMPANY for an all-time classic. With quality and value like this, I hope that Sepia Records are around for a very long time."
2,Too much Manhatten,"Wanting a fresh version of this masterpiece to replace my badly worn LP, I chose the longer version offered on Amazon. Big mistake. Too much added ""filler"" material spoils the simplicity of the original."
2,You get what you pay for,The charger worked with my phone but didn't last as long as the Verizon brand charger I have. The product was made with cheap plastic that cracked after I had it for a few months.
1,Piece of Junk,It is piece of junk and won't work. Make thorough inquiry before making your final decision to buy.
1,Huge Ripoff!!,"I will start off with the fact that I never complain about anything, but I have to let everyone know about this one because I can not get my money back for this waste of disk space. Beware! This is not a tutorial. It's just a brief overview of Cubase 4. There is nothing inspiring or helpful about this so called course. It's over very quickly. You will be better off just reading the manual as I did before I bought this so called tutorial. I could have put together a better one myself. As for the Mixing and Mastering I might be able to eat the cost for that one, but again not a course at all. They just run very quickly through the subjects and leave you wondering why you even bought these overviews. Their advertising is very deceptive. I wasted $60.00 on these so called courses and you will too if you buy this garbage!"
4,"Good collection, but be aware.","The good news is this is s fine collection of Hank Thompson hits. The bad news is they are not the original recordings. Oh, Hanks voice is in fine form and he sounds as good as ever. But if you're looking for the originals you may be let down."
4,fobus thigh rig,It sits a little low and squeaks after a while but after a little grease its fine thats why it doesnt get five stars from me
3,Not for Windshields with a little curve to glass,"My 83 Cherokee uses 16 inch blades but I find 15 inch winter blades work best in bad weather. I find that there is not enough of an arc to the blade to properly cover the right side, passenger side of the windshield. The 16 inch is even worst. I've found that Trico (Duralast at AutoZone) to have more of an arc and thus much better in coverage. If your windshield is near flat they work fine."
2,Missed opportunity,"This segment had a lot of potential to be hot - the outdoors, some decent looking participants, but it ended up being pretty tepid. Disappointing. Save your money on this one and pass on it. There are better in the ""Exposed"" series."
1,"Full of potential ""talent""=Fallon Summers but fails totally!","Sorry excuse of a potentially fantastic idea! This video gets 1 Star because of the all to brief appearance of Hardcore cutey Fallon Summers!!!!! Fallon Summers is the real life ""girl next door""! She has been featured in over 20 Hardcore Features to date,(see her photo on the lower right of the cover)! Look for Fallon *elsewere and pass on this sad, cheap and lazy excuse of a video!"
5,Compelling WWII drama,"I really enjoyed both series 1 and 2 of Enemy at the Door. It is fine period drama--well-written, wonderfully acted, and a fine production all around. I don't quite understand the negative comments; I didn't feel it was a whitewash at all. Not all German soldiers were Nazis; many were simply young German males who were required to serve. In fact, in the series a German commandant is also a victim of Nazi repression, despite being a stellar German officer. I found it an excellent, insightful series. I highly recommend it to all drama lovers."
3,Untold story of World War II,"This is a fairly well written and acted series regarding the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II. A part of the historical record, mostly forgotten, of a Nazi occupation of British territory that is largely overlooked. I found the series of interest andlook forward to viewing the secord set in the hope that all the character issues, etc. will be resolved."
2,Masterful execution of an objectionably flawed concept,"The acting, character development, period settings and costumes and so on are fully up to English television standards. But the Nazi occupation scenarios have been terribly toned down to make them commercially marketable. Numerous scholastic works and even the better theater all point to Nazi behavior as brutal, bestial and sociopathic, hardly reflective of the diplomacy and even gallantry seen from those in this series. The distortion may be objectionable to those of us who have studied the period, and may be enormously offensive to those who had to live through it or know others who did. There is a long list of more authentic and appropriate representations of that era -- choose any of them over this."
2,Disappointed,"Boring. Enjoyed Island at War so much, and was looking for similar material. We could not finish the first episode."
3,Rather disappointed,"I was looking forward to this Series one and two, but it did not live up to my expectations. Island at War was so much more superior and I ordered Enemy at the Door,SEries one and two thinking they would be similar. They did not make the grade, although I do enjoythem."
5,Rolling Stone Review,Best CD we have heard in along time really keeps your feet moving and groving can't wait for the next one keep it up
3,Not a good ending,The beginning and middle of this movie was good but did not make up for the ending. I guess I was expecting some shocking or abrupt ending instead it ended happily everyone making up and moving on! Disgusting!
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz..... what there's a movie on... oh sorry.. zzzzzzzzz....,I hate to be a reviewer who admits he couldn't make it through a movie... but i just couldn't put up with this movie which is supposed to be taken seriously.. I know what your thinking - what right do you have to review a movie when you did not even see the whole thing... you have a point.. but.. as i see it a movie should be interesting all the way through or what is the point of watching? I don't care if it ends well if i cannot make it that far the movie has failed its purpose.. You might enjoy 'breaking and entering' i found it to be a sleeper..
2,Unbelievable Coupling,"My husband and I just didn't buy Jude Law and Robin Wright-Penn as a couple. Nor the supposed attraction and sexual tension between Law and Binoche. Of the three I think Wright-Penn stands out the most, followed by the girl who plays her daughter Bea. The other interesting part was the antics of the young man playing the agile monkey boy. I wouldn't watch this film again."
5,Breaking and Entering,"A surprisingly good movie (to me at least). I like Jude Law's acting as his expressions are more natural that ""acting"".I have enjoyed other movies of his although this one impressed me the most. Maybe because I didn't have high expectations (which tend to ruin most movies for me)."
4,"Real people, real world!","Life, seen from the perspectives of some very genuine people, played beautifully by the leading cast, Juliette Binoche, Robin Penn and Jude Law, the trio shine brilliantly in this little gem. A brief, yet a brilliant performance from Poppy Rogers who leaves no effort in portraying an autistic girl. Although a bit complex, the atmosphere, the situations that occur are very believable and a wonderful cast-performance and direction does justice to this film. The film starts out slow but then soon catches a rapid pace, making you not move even an eye lid. A journey of some real people in a real world, worth witnessing."
3,Parkour and Bosnians make a cameo in London,"Unlike Separate Lies, this movie just isn't entertaining enough to tell an unpleasant message about loving the one you are with. It's tedious. The blowup scene with Robin Wright Penn and Jude Law is godawful cheeze but it is amusing to see Ray Winstone and Robin Wright Penn in the same room since their animated selves were husband and wife in Beowulf. It's completely unbelievable that Jude Law's character would leap the socio-economic divide to start something with Juliette Binoche's character. This movie is pure bullshugar."
2,bad movie,"My biggest problem with this movie involves the script, which has too many characters who appear and disappear, and is far too long.Secondly, the characters do not relate to one another in any meaningful way.Jude Law and his wife are not connected. Jude Law and the boy's mother are equally unconnected. Jude Law, who appears to be a successful architect, never works, never has emotions, and is as drab as his boring wardrobe.Only the minor characters actually show some humanity and distinction but they are too few and far between in a dismal movie."
2,Didn't do it for me,"It takes the first 45 minutes before some things starts to happen and then still it feels very stiffled. What came to mind watching this was the book ""Unholy Hunger"", as it displays very well the feeding happening in human relating on planet Earth. Everyone is feeding on somebody else; sometimes it is mutual feeding and at other times it is distinctly predatorial. Not a pretty sight."
1,Lexmark Junk,Lexmark used to be a good company but I guess they have sold out like others. This printer WASTES a lot more ink than it should. Their cartridges only come half full (same with HP) unless you buy the 'better' ones. This printer is also incredibly slow. The only good thing I can say about it is it seems to last a long time.
1,can't even get this installed on my computer,"I bought this printer and found that I can't even get it installed on my computer. Something about the driver? I have a brand new computer, comes with Windows 7 and this is an older printer. Maybe that's the problem. Bought the printer, ink, USB cable, and it is all useless to me.Oh yeah, the installation CD that came in the box said(in English)that English wasn't an available language for installing the software."
4,quick and sweet,"A very serviceable romance. A sweet, quick read... maybe a little too sweet and a little too quick. Ultimately forgettable, so not her best. But Nora Roberts at her mediocre is still so much better than other authors out there, and at least this isn't one of the newer stories where she's trying to make the characters seem modern and somehow they just come across as coarse."
3,First,"The title does not seem appropriate here,it is a catch to get readers interested in it. Personally it would have been better if the reader was given more backgroung information about Natasha life as a ballerina,the plot keeps the reader interested through out the book.This is the best one of the series as it keeps the reader coming back for more, the characters in the book should have been more developed so that the reader would be interested in finding out what had happened to them in future books"
1,Reissued Book - Overpriced!!,"I am so disappointed in Nora Roberts and her publishers. I am rating this a ""1 star"" simply because the Kindle version does not give any indication that this book was a Silhouette Special Edition originally published in February 1990. Even though I own the entire series in paperback, I would have bought them for my Kindle also if they were reasonably priced. I have loved her books for many years now. Every few years I re-read the Stanslaski series. Every one of the stories were entertaining, engaging, and leave you wanting more; but these books can be purchased in paperback form in a two-book volume for less money! Look for ""The Stanislaskis Sisters: Natasha and Rachel"" (two full novels) and ""The Stanislaski Brothers (Two Complete Novels: Mikhail and Alex)."" They start at one cent."
3,Good Read,"First of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded and gorgeous Ukranian-American family.Both hero and heroine have suffered losses in the past, personal and professional, and have rebuilt their lives accordingly. They are likeable and sympathetic characters, and I was vested in their happiness. He is a father and she runs a toy store, so children and humor were a leavening touch throughout.Enjoy."
5,Another good series,"Having read all of Nora Roberts' books and been on the hunt for more I was very excited to see this series pop up. Great start to the series and all the passion, romance and drama one has come to expect from the best author there is!"
3,Scraping the barrel for PUBLIC DOMAIN material.,"Not much of Bogart's material is public domain so cheapie companies like this end up putting out the same stuff.BEAT THE DEVIL has been released previously, the Laserdisc is the only good copy out there.THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM is an unusual release. This kinoscope is one of the few television appearances made by Bogart, and on a comedy show! Bogie plays it straight as he delivers his lines and sings a commercial (they worked these into the story in the old days of television). This show is a rarity worth getting the DVD for. Be aware that it is mastered from a 16mm kinoscope (filmed off of a television screen), so picture quality will not be very good."
2,boring remixes that strayed away from the original greatness,I really like the original push it remix but if you already have it and are looking for more great mixes stear clear of this one.
3,OK,"I really enjoyed Asia music for years. Wetton has a gifted voice. The music was definitely retro, but after playing it a few timers, I liked it. I'm not jumping up and down about it, but I liked it."
2,Another reissue,"Originally released by E'G/Polydor Records, reissued in the U.S. by Passport/Jem/Caroline and elsewhere by Virgin. Had three other covers. I had heard half the album already on the 1987 compilation ""King's Road 1973-80"", and a live version of ""Woman"" on ""Arkangel"". I have the Australian LP, but most CD reissues have bonus tracks, and I went to a legal site for the mp3s. You know how it is. The album at first got little notice. A year or two later, Asia came to pass. The rest is history. It wouldn't be until after leaving Asia in the early '90s that John Wetton would the full-fledged solo career that once again takes a back seat to Asia."
2,Muy pobre,"Mi interés por John Wetton proviene, exclusivamente, de su participación en King Crimson. Por ese motivo, cuánto más se aleja de lo que hizo con el grupo, y posteriormente en UK, menos me gusta. No obstante, los últimos discos (Rock of Faith, Sinister, etc.) aún siendo comerciales y, un tanto blanditos, tienen buenos momentos y se escuchan con agrado. No así este que nos ocupa que, además de contar con pocas ideas compositivas, se ve lastrado por la horrible producción típica de los años 80. Mucha ampulosidad, mucho teclado para un disco de AOR sin demasiados vuelos."
5,"Finally, THE overdue recognition for four talented lads!","I first heard Dif Juz's Vibrating Air and Huremics EPs in the early 1980s while working on air as a disc jockey at college (Northern IL Univ.). They were masters of some incredibly sensual and memorably ethereal guitar pieces. The lack of vocals made them all the more unique and passionate. The video to NO MOTION on another 4AD soundtrack (Lonely is an Eysore) combines some incredible camera work capturing this band in motion. David and Alan Curtis, along with Gary Bromley and Richard (not John Boy Walton) Thomas fashion an incredible wall of sound and It's gratifying to hear these tracks again and together on cd. I play this one often! Every cut is hot and if you appreciate Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Throwing Muses or Bauhaus, you'll absolutely be thrilled with this. Impress the daylights out of your friends and Buy it NOW!"
3,Amazon Shopper,"The Oxford Music Dictionary is in some ways useful, but as the title depicts, one would assume that a ""dictionary"" would contain pronunciations, but this book does not. Its good to know what sfortzando and fortissimo means, but can you say them? Given that every book has some downfall or another, I felt this should be titled ""The Oxford Collection of Musical Terms,"" with the exclusion of ""dictionary."""
4,Practicall and functional,Just what is expected but for the fact that it may get stuck if cap detaches while inserted.
5,Good,Makes a wonderful soup and I am glad I purchased the item. I think they should add more to the package for the price that is paid.
3,Cool but not very functional,I got these for my fiancee who has been playing guitar for 11 years by now. He thought they were really cool but he doesn't play with them because he says they make it difficult. I didn't bother to ask how or why but he gave a pic to his friend who has been playing for 2 years and the next day that friend came over and said that they suck and that they catch/grab onto the strings when you pick and strum. I figured it might be because they are not smooth and slanted at the side but who wants to take the time with a razor to edge them out? My fiancee says if you try to play with the side (like it says you can) it just feels like you are playing with the side(as opposed to the pointed edge) of a regular pick. He went out and bought those regular 4.00$ for 12 fender picks.
3,Eh?,For the price this was very good but the black does fade away during use. It doesn't fade fast but noticable.
5,My Bro's Christmas Present,"My brother is a guitar geek and has been asking for a Pick of Destiny forever!! Now he's getting six under the tree in a few days! They shipped fast enough and I think the price was right. I don't know much about guitar picks, but these seem to be good quality and such and the details look really cool. I think he's gonna love them."
3,Don't look as good as the picture...,"I was pretty disappointed that mine don't look nearly as good as the ones pictured. The coloring is off, the stenciling isn't very centered and in some cases just looks weird. Everyone who sees them knows what they are supposed to be, and they are somewhat useable (a little too big, I prefer smaller jazz picks) but purely as a replica, they are kind of disappointing."
5,Boyfriend liked it & I do too:),It sucks that the picture is only printed on the back but it's still green on the back. I like it and it's REALLY strong. Hardly bends! Great but not so much a great pick for the guitar. My boyfriend said it's hard to play with it :O and I agree
2,Really cool... looking.,"This pick is really cool... looking. If you prefer to play with a really thick pick it might be great, but it is a bit too thick for me (and I'm using it on a bass). It comes in a pack of six ($4 cheap!), so it can make a good pass-around gift for your musician friends. Keep one in your wallet... put one on a necklace... you know, for kicks. ""Dude, it's the Pick of DESTINY!"" Yeah. Playing with it...? not so much..."
4,Better than I expected. I actually prefer to play with these over normal picks!,"I read a lot of reviews complaining about the size of these picks being slightly too large, I actually like this size. They fit in my hand very well and I feel more secure holding these than I do regular picks because of the added surface area. I also read that since the edges aren't smooth they get caught on strings. That never happens. Unless you're picking with these completely wrong they feel great.The only problem I had was that since I played with it so much the paint came off from constant use over a few days. But hey, they were ridiculously cheap and I only scraped up one and it still plays great, so I have 5 more perfect looking picks to show off."
5,"You Can Call Me ""Master Exploder""","So my schlady friend give me this Destiny Pick for me to make heavy metal sex face all night, and I can't stop melting peoples' eardrums wherever I go.It doesn't matter which of the three sides I use, it just comes out like a heavy metal lightning storm in your eardrums. No really, KG and Jables rang me on the telephone and said they want to make me the third member of the D; it's that heavy.This just in: Kirk Hammett retires from music career out of shame of not playing heavy enough. He should have gotten a P.O.D."
3,its ok...,"its very cool to have this... to have ""fun"" but it doesn't work when your going to make a real jam... actually it is for like rythm not solos... but its ok... no regrets about my money..."
3,As Good as Dead,"Six years ago, Luke Delaney was forced to put himself into his own form of witness protection following a hitman's moment of compassion. Yet, when his father dies, he feels the need to risk it all to come home. Though he his careful, observing at a distance, he is spotted by people who will kill him. Suddenly, all of Luke's family and friends are plunged into danger that has lain dormant for six years. Fortunately, his sister, Angel, has already proven herself as a private investigator, and she is determined to solve the case.*** This fast paced mystery does not cut any corners. Unlike many secular books of this genre, the author does not rely on sex and cheap, gory thrills to move the story along. However, that does not mean it's a wimpy, Christian novel. It is Christian, but in no way is it wimpy, and the message is not beaten over the readers' heads. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,Superb,A triple treat! Can't wait to read Ms Rushford's sequel to book #3. I'm already excited. Truly a great read.
5,Another good one,I have really enjoyed this Angel Delaney series. Good story lines that keep me wondering till the end and interesting charaters that keep my attention.
4,Great read,Love this series....Hope there are more. I have enjoyed the Angel Delaney stories and look forward to the next one
4,Good easy read,It was a good book it wasn't predictable at the end but it was a slow start. They had good character development
2,Good tunes but definitely not a great workout,"I ordered this video from collagevideo.com (they sell exercise videos and DVDs), who gave it a ""beginners"" labeling. Well, beginners is right, because I didn't break a sweat each time I did this tape. It barely gets your heart pumping. It has good '60s soul songs but if you're looking for a video to really exercise to, then this isn't the tape for you. It's just too slow. However I suppose it's good for some people who may need low-low-impact exercises. My overall rating is 2 stars because I didn't feel like I had exercised after this tape. It felt like I had just walked briskly up a flight of stairs...and that's it."
2,Don't sing along,"I really enjoy Tamilee and think she has a great, athletic body. I also like her videos--usually. This one doesn't do enough for my heartrate and Tami's singing along is annoying. It would be good for someone just starting out, perhaps."
2,Unimpressed,"Good music, but the workout was too easy for my taste. I think Tamilee Webb is awesome when it comes to strength training, but I have yet to be impressed with her cardio routines."
2,Less than excited,"I purchased this one and only used it once. I love some of her other DVDs and use them several times a week (I Want That Body). She has great energy and a cute personality, but I don't think I would buy this one again."
1,This tape was AWFUL!,"The DVD arrived much sooner than expected. I was excited to get started, and plugged it in right away. I could not hear the music, I could not tell what song was playing, I could not follow the moves. I wanted to DANCE to Motown! If I wanted to exercise to the oldies I would have ordered a Richard Simmons tape. I HATED this DVD. I could not HEAR THE MUSIC, the whole point of exercising to Motown! Don't waste your money!"
3,Eh. Ok.,"I was hoping for some tasty Chapel Hill-flavored tidbits, but overall I was kinda disappointed. SAD's 'Butterflies' is still great, but this recording is not any different, really, than on The Mayor Will Abdicate (get this one instead!). 'Work in a Restaurant' reminds me of Violent Femmes, it's a happy little tune. 'Jack Ball' is pretty good fightin' music. Overall, there's some good messy rock 'n roll scattered throughout this CD. The Grand Pricks, however, suck (track 15). They sound like a bad high school band, do not rock, and just totally ruin the album."
4,Some very good songs,"Some very good songs here -- really like ""40 Acres"" and, of course, ""Looking at the World through a Windshield,"" ""Six Days on the Road,"" and ""I'm a Truck."" Some of the others are pretty downbeat and corny.The version of ""Jackson"" has a flub in the middle -- she starts a verse and stops after two words. Doubt if that was the way it was released originally.Overall worth the money. Wish I could find more Willis Bros."
2,I'm a Sucker.,"Okay, so these are little adhesive patches with botanical(?) stuff in them that smells horrible. You wear these on your feet at night, and I think they make your feet sweat, and the sweat turns the funky botanical stuff dark. Think smelly adhesive tea bags taped to your feet. I mean, if just by getting sweat out of your body you are improving your health, then yes, I guess they work. But that black stuff isn't coming out of your body. It's just sweat-stained smelly tea leaves."
1,Lied! No FDA,"Checked with FDA, not true! Product is not registered. I wonder what other thigs aren't true."
4,Decent,The foot pads worked decent. I'm still trying to figure out how they work. But look like they do something.
1,Nothing.,"These things are all hype. They do nothing. The pads do not get lighter as you use them, they look the same after every night. From what I can tell, the dried vinegar in the pads absorbs your sweat, oxidizes (which makes it look that ugly brown), and stinks. That's all."
1,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time or money. Totally ineffective - did nothing but make me feel foolish for putting them on my feet every night and giving my feet a funny smell everyday.
1,I've seen better quality film in a bathtub!!!,The quality on this DVD looks like one of those multi-generation VHS dubs you find bootlegged at a convention! This is probably the WORST quality DVD I've ever seen! The 8mm home movie footage actually sometimes looks BETTER than the interviews shot back in 1993! Simply HORRIBLE!!!
3,Too much information,"High convenience with vocabulary below and commentary. However, virtually every line contains almost all long marks. This makes scanning practice difficult. The text is small and the margins are tiny. This makes note taking difficult."
2,New edition spares the frustration!,"Boyd's revised edition of Virgil's Aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the AP Latin: Virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all Classicists. With all the lines on the AP syllabus and no more, Boyd's Aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test. Each page has a paragraph of Latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints. A glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words. While Clyde Pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the Pharr text contains ALL of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the Aeneid. Thus, Boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus. It is a great way to study Virgil's classic epic."
5,An important Text for an important time,"This collection of critical essays does much to clarify the readers understanding and enhance one's appreciation of the period that produced such great works as Ulysses and The Waste Land. By laying a ground work that focuses on historical and geographical scholarship and the individual movements that make up Modernism the editors have succeeded in portraying Modernism in all of its diversity. This book is essential to those who want a good, non-reductive introduction a great literary movement."
4,This is for klynnega,"If you go on a fast and then go biking for 30 miles, OF COURSE you would get dizzy!! When you go on a fast, you are supposed to take it easy or do mild exercises. Those 3 pounds you gained back overnight? That's water retention, not body fat. You would have had to eat 10,800 calories in a day to gain three pounds of body fat."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I have been moving towards a Raw Foods diet for some time now. I have been reading & learning as much as possible on the subject and making ""baby steps"". This cleanse is the perfect way to start my whole new path to Raw Foods, cleanse the body and then only put pure living foods in afterwards. If you are someone who is also considering to move on the a healthier way of life, I highly recommend starting off with the Lemonade Diet!Peter, Thank you for providing this Information!"
5,Thanks Peter,"I was told about the Master Cleanse back in 2002. Since then I have done it religiously every 4 months for the past 5 years! I am a 42 year old male. I played alot of basketball growing up and in my 30's acquired bone spurs in my left foot. When I am on the cleanse I feel absolutely fantastic and so does my foot. I am now on day 11 and have lost about 10 pounds (now 175; 6'). I work on a marketing floor and I have had dozens of others begin the cleanse, with life changing results! Thanks Peter!"
2,Less than Lukewarm,"I bought Glickman's book and CD with the intent to read about the cleanse when I had downtime between appointments, etc. And, I'd listen to the cd during my commute to work, etc. I would not recommend the book. (See my review about the book.). I definitely would not recommend the CD either because it is poorly organized in its presentation of the program. Glickman seems to be in conversation with some guy who sounds like a paid DJ. The information was also repetitive in nature such that I got the impression that Glickman was using up ""air time"". However, I give Glickman his ""props"" for being creative enough to dawn a CD about the cleanse."
2,The Lemonade Diet,I was expecting this to be more informative - it wasn't worth the price of the book and the shipping cost. It left many questions unanswered.
2,Ms. Critical,"Comfortable Country by Enrica StabileI have the large version, and the photography is beautiful! I like decorating with worn items with a history, but some of the rooms look downright dirty. Example - the kitchen on page 54. I don't need new expensive appliances, but I couldn't live with this kitchen. Some of the rooms are charming, but others are sad, with the stuffing coming out of the pillows, rotting wood, and peeling paint ~ possibly lead-based. Sorry, but it's a little MORE comfort than I need!"
4,Country decorating,This is a beautifully illustrated book. I am new to country decorating and I found it contained some really good information. It's worth reading but is not the end-all for folks interested in decorating with a country theme.
4,"Beautiful,for a very tiny version!","I love this book, though I needed a magnifying glass to read it. Please beware that many Sellers sell the very tiny version of this book. (Most buyers will not know that two versions were issued of this book). Thus, I did not think to check the ""SIZE OF THE BOOK"" when ordering this decorating book, therefore when it arrived I was shocked to find it was only about 5 inches big. Yieks! It can fit in my wallet!I think that had I ordered the regular book sized version of this book ,I would have enjoyed it more.Other than the tiny itsy bitsy size of this book, the photos were wonderful and inspiring!"
5,BOOK OF THE YEAR,"This is the very best deorating and idea book of the year (and in the longest time)! Since I operate my own Country Cottage Decor Store, I hunt for every new book in this category, but none has surprised me more positivly than ""Comfortable Country"". Wonderful journey from page to page;- Imagine the smell of crisp linens and snuggling into poofy, down pillows! You have to look through it over & over and still see new details. The reading part is also very informativ! WOW-Those pictures are true inspiration! Possible to recreate, no matter what size your budget, home and own skills! Hope to see more from this gifted author;- soon!"
4,pages of hope,"Ms Rhodes biography makes up in shear determination what it may lack in literary style. She has opened the window to her soul and we find that there can be a peaceful ending....not the sugar coated happy ending we often find. Her Miracle came after many years of self destructive behavior. We may not have the same problems in our own lives, but we can find hope that we too can survive until we find our own Miracle."
4,The Sick and the Tired,"This is a fine memoir detailing a barely conceivable life's journey. Despite undiagnosed Alcoholism and Schizophrenia, Ms. Rhodes was able to find a path to survival, and ultimate serenity in her life.Her career path included Airline Hostess, Nurse, and Prostitute.Her travels make fascinating reading, and the message of hope will be inspiring to anyone troubled by any form of addiction."
3,Rock a by baby...,Seemed like a good idea... But then since it is a half moon shape it tips over with the slightest bump. So when you pull your coiled hose out of it those coils bump it about 10 times or more on the way out and guess what?It tips over...
2,Disappointing Effort,"Season one and two of this TV series stayed true to the heart of the story. Unfortunately, Season three did not. The writers did a good job creating Catherine's exit but seemed to get lost trying to craft a path for Vincent alone. Only die hard fans can enjoy the complete DVD."
5,Final Season Linda Hamilton Shines,"Marvellously packaged, a treat to fill a timeless collection. much recommended.A wondrous love story."
4,Beauty and the Beast - The End,The third season of Beauty and the Beast was a departure from the first two seasons but still very much worth seeing.
4,"Tolerable, But Not Transcendent","Beauty and the Beast for two, all too short, seasons represented TV at it's very best, and I did absolutely find the death of Linda Hamilton's character horrendous. What made the show glorious was its epic romanticism, and otherworldly timelessness. It took issues of the heart, and made them into parables- without proselytizing. The forbidden love angle made it more poignant yet, and the extreme chemistry between its two stars, for my money, has rarely been approached ( note that I did not say ' equaled ' ).All of this said, the third season of the show was not an atrocity- it was still palatable in fact, but the magic no longer existed, and without that ever-growing love between Vincent and Catherine the series lost itsfoundation, and no amount of blood could bring back its heart."
5,The Last Chapter,"Without Beauty this tale had nowhere to go but down, still miss Ron's voice, the perfect love, and the fairytale. Great for all fans."
5,Beauty and The Beast,"I am still crying over the final season of Beauty and the Beast. I watched the 1st and 2nd and final season and I did not want it to end. I keep thinking they will have something after the final..like a sequel with Vincent's son. Too bad there weren't twins, then the daughter could be like Catherine and we could see more seasons with Vincent and the tunnel cast and his children."
4,Bittersweet ending,"Watching Season 3 opened up a floodgate of emotions for me. Firstly, deep grief, followed by a sense of betrayal and ultimately a reluctant ""acceptance"". Though Lovers be Lost reminded me that true love endures despite of a painful separation. Walk Slowly was the season shining moment but will leave you spiritually drained and empty after watching it. Despite the intense emotionally turmoil associated with this dark season, I am glad I stucked with it to see Catherine's death (or was it?) avenged and Jacob saved in the World below. To me, it was a bittersweet ending to my favourite TV series but I will never watch S3 again!"
3,13 Episode Season and it Costs MORE than Seasons 1 or 2???,"Hmmm, something smells wrong here. Season 3 is 13 episodes (if you count THOUGH LOVERS BE LOST as 2 eps) and it is priced higher than either Seasons 1 or 2 which had 22 episodes each? I mean if this final season was loaded with extras sure, but if all we get is 13 eps, $60 retail? REALLY? WITH A STRAIGHT FACE? ;)"
1,Passionate about this series,"I am passionate about this series and was looking forward to owning it, but alas it is not in caption so is not available to me. Sad"
5,Beauty and the Beast Final Season,"I always liked the original series and on this DVD format it is even better, if that's possible. Very pleased with the DVD's. I thought the final season was awesome and probably the best of the 3 seasons."
3,Final season of Beauty & the Beast,"I need information of the last season of B&B;, where there only 11discs? The final season i purchased did not have an ending??Cananyone help.PamNevada"
3,Quite good,As I live in Ireland I had never seen the last series of Beauty and The Beast. If you know the ending you will probably thinki it is very good but I was disappointed. Although it does leave the end open for a follow up if it might happen.
2,A terrible end to a great series,"If you are considering buying all three years of this series, you need to reconsider. If you want to see just how bad a good series can become, you should buy the third year. If you prefer to see what the creators had in mind and a lovely, transporting series; stay with the first two years.I don't know that I have ever seen a series destroyed so completely as was done with the series in the third year."
2,Sorry but I can never watch 3rd season again,"I was one of the many fans who fought CBS to bring back this wonderful show. That old saying ""Be careful what you wish for"" sure came true in my opinion here. I will always feel betrayed by CBS, Ron Koslow the producer and the writers of this show. Better they had been truthful to those of us fighting that Linda Hamilton would not be returning and the show would be going in a completely new direction. The show was titled ""Beauty and the Beast"" and with the terribly painful killing of The Beauty the soul of this show and the reason for watching was lost to me.I know there are many fans of third season. Enjoy but I cannot.I still entertain some faint hope that this will come back someday as a movie with Vincent and Catherine. Hopefully with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton before they are too old to play the roles, but perhaps with new actors if need be. I still feel like I need resolution to Catherine and Vincent timeless romance."
5,Thank God for Ron Perlman!,"WARNING: Possible SPOILER!!!When I was accidentally told that Catherine died, watching it was even worse! Last night while watching the first disc, I had pause it and make sure I could still breathe...so sad! But after reading several reviews, I know that its Ron Perlman (Vincent) who made the show possible! I'm touched by his amazing, touching performance (especially when talks of his love for her) and glad he won that Golden Globe. I'm not done with the season yet, but I give this show 5 stars still because like they say:""Death shall have no dominion!""For those who are going to watch the final season, be forewarned that this season is dark and full of death. Though the revenge Vincent carries out is worth it, its still hard to watch. I wonder what would've happened if Linda didn't leave the show.... Oh well, to Ron Perlman, thank you for inspiring so many people about the power of love!BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FOREVER"
3,Painful but...,Season 3 was a painful one to watch BUT...if you're an avid fan of this wonderful TV show - you have to complete the series. I agree with another reviewer who feels that CBS should have given fans a nice ending with the conclusion of season 2. The success of the series was entirely based on the chemistry between Linda and Ron and the beautiful relationship between Catherine and Vincent. It was stupid to think the show could go on without that. CBS might have done better ending the series at season 2 and then perhaps doing a movie or two down the line if Linda and Ron agreed to that later on and perhaps they might have.
5,I'm not telling you!,"Tracy West is a really wonderful author and she has really done her best book this time. So what's the secret of the pink pokemon? I'm not telling you, but wait till you buy this book by Tracy West! You'll be glad I didn't tell you when you read it because it has a real cool ending, it'll keep you in suspense. This is one of the best Pokemon series book. Buy it!"
3,a general overview,"This is not a grammar of Basque, but a concise and general overview of the language, dealing with history, pronunciation, and morphology. It may be of some interest to students of historical Basque, but even as an introduction, it is very slender and concerns itself with generalities, rather than specifics."
3,Too predictable,"I liked this book, but I guessed both the identity of the murder and two basic plot twists (I won't tell you which ones so I don't spoil it for you) before I was even halfway through with the book..."
1,?!,$98 for a cutting board? Is this a joke? Looks like it is so please correct the mistake. The same board with red and black edge ships for free so Amazon pls fix this mistake.
5,Nice product....fast shipping,"This is a great and easy to clean chopping board. I also like the rubberized sides which prevent slippage. And for a man who has been described as ""hyper"", ""never sits still"", and others things I probably will not write here.....non slippage with sharp knives is vital."
2,I miss the depth of the Cris songs from her solo career,My friends and I agree that this CD has a dark side influenced by the combination of Tret and Cris. We miss the old song from Cris that seem to have more meaning for us. The music itself seem repetitive.
2,something's missing,"having enjoyed previous albums of this duo so very much, we were let down by this album. There was a palpalble absence of lyrical depth that can only be described as disappointing. A few songs, however, still show the old sparkle, and promise that subsequent albums may hit the mark."
1,Disappointing.,"The songs all sound the same, with a beat that, after so much repetition, is annoying. The lyrics strain to match the music. I've listened to Cris for 25 years and this is the first time I haven't liked something she's done."
2,Wonderful CD,"Everything they've ever recorded has been very good, and this is no exception. There are some excellent songs here--the kind that leave you humming all day. I'm sorry that there won't be any more CD's by these two."
5,songs that you can't forget!,"I have loved Cris & Tret's work form the very first time I heard them. This release is no exception. Their creative use of everyday images really makes the songs come to life. I can see as well as feel what each song is about. Each song is truly unique- no ""copy catting"" of earlier work like so many other artists do. Definitly a must have for your music collection!"
2,mediocre. Not up to their previous standard,"I was disappointed by this album. It does not live up to their previous high standards. There are a few exceptional songs, but all in all, the lyrics are weak and lack the freshness they brought to ""Between the Covers"""
5,"Brilliant, all-encompassing music. Once again they shine.","I have listened to many an album of these two legends and I think this is one of their artistic best. Cris and Tret have woven together a blanket of joy and passion that surrounds you when you listen to the music. You will feel the power of the women behind the music and the life of those they write about. If you are not touched by this wonderful album, then you have something terribly wrong inside of you. I think all who listen will be satisfied."
4,"this is a gorgeous album, with great dimension and variety","I love this album....my favorite from Cris and Tret in years. The subjects they choose to write about, the artistry and the musicianship, all truly exemplary. I am so anxious to hear them in concert again, and must say I do miss their band.....I hope those days aren't gone forever."
3,Spinoza: A life,"The book give a great details about the life during the inquisition time in Spain Portugal & Holland..Is has a very good view about the terrible consequences of fanatics in the Catholic religion, and show why the world was intellectually almost paralyzed during the dark ages of the religion terror.However, the book only give small inside about the wonderful philosophical thinking of Spinoza, is more a historic book than a philosophical one.."
1,lost in facts,"I simply could not relate to this book, a reaction which may or may not reflect an adequate idea."
5,Corinna Fugate is back as ROSE MERCURY!,Just recently after a lengthy disappearance from the online world and beyond Corinna Fugate has returned. She has legally changed her name to ROSE MERCURY! She can once again be found on UTube and MySpace under the afore mentioned name. She continues to capture new fans from all around the world with her beautifully haunting melodies and angelic voice. Sush musical creations that touch the listeners very spirit and resounates in so many ways. Hopefully we will be able to purchase her cds in the near future! :)
3,Great book but not for iPad!!!!,"I hate that I bought this for my ipad. You don't see the pictures well or with the words on the page. Not sure why, but there are small little boxes of the same wording on the three pictures and then in bigger writing, yet it's all the same. The kids feel like I'm not reading something. Good book but something is very wrong for the Ipad kindle version!!!!!!"
3,brian baker...,"if anyone cares, brian baker of minor threat, government issue, dag nasty, doggy style, (my personal fave) junkyard, and bad religion fame played on this album...perhaps that factoid will move a few units"
2,"Great at first, but doesn't last","We got these for xmas last year. They were great, for about 9 months. At that point they started to spider crack on the bottom, and shortly after they started to leak. I expect more from Oxo."
3,Mixed Bag,"It seems unfair to give the OXO Good Grips a single star rating, since it's made up of three different measuring cups. So here is my detailed analysis...4-Cup Measuring Cup: Mediocre at best.2-Cup Measuring Cup: Excellent! Top notch. Brilliant!1-Cup Measuring Cup: Absurd and inferior. Practically useless.I hope this helps!"
1,Beware-don't buy because they CRACK.,"I bought 3 different size measuring cups of this type and each one eventually got a hairline crack at the mold injection site (either side of bump on bottom of cup). You won't see it until you notice your countertop is wet after measuring a liquid in it, as it leaks very slowly....wrote Oxo about this problem, as these measuring cups are not cheap, and bought a better brand thinking they would be high quality. I am awaiting Oxo's response. I think buying glass would be a better idea, you don't have to worry about whether or not to use it in the microwave either, causing the crack to happen even sooner. I always top rack washed them in my DW. Kind of a bummer, as I really liked the accurate measuring lines for liquids."
3,GREAT idea but would be better if made from GLASS,"What a relief to be able to measure liquid (and in some cases dry ingredients) without having to double-over just to see the ""magic line"". Can now stand up and get an accurate measurement. Washing is just a tad bit more difficult with the internal, angled measuring device, but seemed worth it. Now, after continued use minor scratches form on the PLASTIC not only making them LOOK less than pristine (almost appears ""dirty"") which of course obsecures your measurements.GREAT idea, just needs a little tweaking - such as making them out of glass. Trade-off would be that glass breaks/shatters whereas plastic doesn't."
4,Reinventing the measuring cup,"I have arthritis in my knees, and find it difficult to continually stoop over to read the measurements on liquid measuring cups. No more! Oxo Angled Measuring Cups features easy-to-read measurements (the cups also feature metric equivalents) that can be viewed from above. This set of three measuring cups (1, 2, and 4 cups) is an excellent value and makes a thoughtful housewarming / wedding present (but be sure to buy a set for yourself as well).It takes a little practice to pour and read accordingly, but once you have the hang of it, you'll never go back to old-fashioned measuring cups that require stooping and bending."
3,It's okay - except for the handles,"I love viewing the measuring marks from the top rather than the side of the cup - however, the handles are too long. On all but the largest model (the 4-cup size), the handle touches the countertop and may even be a tad bit longer than the cup - causing it to tilt just enough that measurements are off. I get around this problem by placing the cup on top of a thick cutting board with the handle hanging over the edge and not touching anything. I wish I didn't have to though.Also, as another reviewer noted, they don't stack very well.Both of these problems could be solved by making them handle-less as was done on the tiny 2 ounce model.I am glad that someone else said that they could handle boiling water. I have been hanging on to my old glass Pyrex cups for use with very hot liquids - such as boiling water used in making Jell-O. I had assumed they'd crack or become crazed/crackled if used with boiling water. Thanks."
4,"Darling, but...","This crib is adorable, but there are a few things I think would have made it even better:1. I wish it came with a blanket and pillow. It does have a thin pad in the bottom to lay the doll on, but it would've been nicer if it also had a blanket and pillow that matched. (Now I have to make them myself and they won't be a perfect match.)2. I WISH it could rock! This will be a Christmas gift for my daughter and I have waffled over returning it and buying a cradle instead just because I know my daughter would LOVE it if she could rock the baby to sleep in it. (I'm keeping it since it matches the doll and since it is so cute...so now I'm brainstorming how I can add to it to make it rock without making it look ugly!:))3. I wish it were a few inches longer. Princess Alexa is a 16"" doll and she just barely fits in it, with no room to spare. It would be better if the interior length was at least 18"" long."
4,They know their target audience!,"We bought this crib along with the doll for our 4 yr old daughter. She loves it. The crib was easy to put together, and seems as though it will stay that way. The diagrams were easy to follow. It is just plastic, however, so it won't hold up to a lot of abuse from enthusiastic youngsters. Still, my daughter loves it, and the doll. I would buy it again. Good price for what it is, and Mattel is a well-known brand. Good for this year's ""hot"" toy, but won't last years and years in order to be an heirloom. If you want items like that,see American Girl's site and check out Bitty Baby."
3,TOO SMALL,"I got the crib, pram and doll for my very nearly 3 year old. The crib is too small and does not even come with a blanket. As she was unhappy with the doll and stroller, this item has been returned. Also it is constructed of very hard, non durable plastic. Not practical for her age."
1,A real piece of crap,"Sound quality on this unit -incoming and outgoing messages - is awful. After about a month, the machine started freezing, not picking up calls etc. I called ATT customer sevice, they had no insight into the nature of the problem. They wanted me to send it in so they could examine it and replace it; I'm going to replace it, but it won't be with an ATT machine."
4,Entertaining and enlightening - should have been more carefully researched.,"This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.Enjoy, but do filter the content."
3,"Not as good as Motown Moves, but still pretty fun!","Fit to the Hits Rock Hard Assets is about 32 1/2 minutes long with warmup and cooldown. Tamilee does a good job of cueing. She sang some of the time, which got a little old after a while.There's quite a few twisting moves in this one doesn't make it easy to do on carpeted surface without modifying. Also, not a very intense workout, but still fun.The songs were recognizable...mostly 70s rock hits (covers).Recommend to beginners/low intermediate with a bit of dance experience."
2,Ultimately disappointing.,"The problem with this video is primarily audio. The workout is fine, and could be fun, but Tamilee's voice track is so loud, and the music so quiet, that it was almost pointless for the producers to have used such potentially good tracks. A tape for rock 'n' roll lovers this is definitely not!"
4,Good workout!!,Only problem with this workout was that the volume kept going up and then down... at some points it was super loud than a few seconds later it was so low. that was the only bad thing about this tape. the songs are fun and the workout is a solid 25 minutes. definitely a keeper :)
1,lame,This is a totally lame workout. You won't even start to sweat and the music is so lame. I'd never even heard of these songs.
2,Beginners Only,"I really like Tamilee (particularly I Want Those... series), but this and its cousin, the Motown Moves video/dvd are very basic. Again, it is annoying when she sings along and the &quot;workout&quot; wear in these will show you it is a junior high dance of a workout with costumes instead of a tough fitness routines."
2,This DVD needs help...,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon.com. The problem is not with Amazon, rather it is with the DVD. After replacing the one I ordered, the problem still occurs. At 19 minutes or so, it skips and your workout is ruined. Upon looking at the back of the DVD, there are bubbles all over it. I think this is the problem. So, I am also going to write to the company that makes this and let them know the problem. Just a word of warning to those who are going to purchase it."
5,A QUE LLAMAMOS ESPA`A,ES UN LIBRO MUY INTERESANTE EN EL QUE SE HACE UN INTERESANTE ESTUDIO DE ESPAÑA
3,Horror Cult Classic,"This is truly horror art. Although not a film I would watch often it is a classic along with ""Last House on the Left"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", et cetera. Probably the best movie dealing with rape. Although most women would not go vigilante as she does, I would bet they certainly think about it. To often low budget films like this are swept aside for more mainstream ones. Fortunately enough of a following has somehow brought this out on DVD. Not for the squeamish. A hard story that does not pull any punches."
4,brilliant,"This was exactly what i was looking for!! An hours worth of pure african sounds of the bush! No music, no interruptions, just lovely typical african sounds of the wild."
2,Good but broke,"It arrived in a cellophane bag with no tags or labels. I enjoyed watering with it for two days and then the shower head popped all of a sudden and would not stay on the metal pipe any longer. No matter what I do, it just pops out again. So ,sadly it is a good product, but very poorly made. There should have been something to hold the shower head in place. instead it is simply inserted on a metal pipe with nothing to hold it or keep it in place."
2,I did not receive this even though I ordered it,I received a smaller wand even though I ordered the longer one... which I don't really like because I needed the longer one to reach farther plants.
5,Early Petula Clark,Petula Clark is my favorite female singer. She had a great career before making it in America. The cuts on this CD show what a beautiful voice she had early in her career and still has today.
2,Player Not!,"Upon receiving the player, we loaded some music into it. It worked fine for the first charging. However we were unable to recharge it after that!"
4,Exactly what we wanted,"Works in our 510. A penny under the cost of free shipping.Good all around, happy to have the unit cleaning the air again."
4,Functions very well,The only drawback is the expense of the filters. I'm looking at newer options but this one still runs well.
5,Filter by Whirlpool for Whirlpool,"It's an OEM product, so it fits the air purifier and works as designed. Not much more to say beyond that."
4,Required textbook,This is a required textbook for 4 of the classes I need and this was cheaper than the school bookstore.
2,"Small effort about a huge, awesome park...","This wafer-thin guide reminds me of something a tour bus company might hand out to it's passengers. There is not much detail, it is more a pamplet than a guide and most dirt routes are completely omitted.""Road Guide"" doesn't serve as enough of a guide, even at the modest price. Death Valley is a huge park and to produce a quality guide one must go into some depth and do copius research. Aside from some nice color photos here there just is not much good to say about this little book. Except for the one or two day rushed visitor, who will never again return, this guide doesn't even come close to being helpful. If you just want to make a one-time quicky visit, drive through and never take the time to really see and discover Death Valley I suppose you could find this of some use. I'll be relegating mine to a box of garage sale merchandise I have.If it weren't for the nice photos I'd give this one star, and I've never rated anything that low before."
1,I believe the authors have a political agenda,While this book is an interesting read I was completely turned off when I came across a passage about half way through. The authors stated that Ronald Reagan had been brain dead for many years. To me this invalidated many of the ideas put forth in the first half. I stopped reading the book at this point and returned it to the lending library.
3,I bought this book because of my interest in HUNA,"I bought this book because of my interest in Hawaiian Spirituality, and wanted to read material written by a native Hawaiian instead of a ha'ole's perception of Hawaiian spirituality. I was sadly mistaken in that hope.This book is an autobiography instead of a guide book to help people understand Hawaiian Spirituality or practise it. the title ""Kahuna of Light: The World of Hawaiian Spirituality"" implies in my opinion; this is supposed to be a guide book.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
4,AC cover,It is super easy to install. Only thing I wish is that there was a flap that wrapped around the bottom part that the straps would hold in place to provide a bit more protection/coverage.
2,not what i expected.,"From the description given I thought it was smaller and would fit my window unit. However it was way to big for my 10,000btu window unit."
2,MED COVER,I HAVE RETURNED THIS COVER. I ORIGINALLY ORDERED 2 DIFFERENT SIZES AND THIS ONE WAS JUST TOO BIG FOR MY UNIT.
5,For anyone who has ever loved a dog,"This book touched my heart when I saw it on a desk of a co worker it was a wonderful gift for my husband. What a touching wonderful book with beautiful illustrations, a must read for anyone."
5,Great book!!!,"If you are a dog lover, you will certainly enjoy this one. I bought it as a gift for some of my ""dog"" friends and they loved it. It's very sweetly written and would recommend it to anyone that has a love for dogs."
5,wish all of the episodes were on DVD,"I ordered this DVD after my granny saw a infomercial for the DVD collection of Hee Haw. Man, I love that show! It is one of the few chances you get to see all the older country music singers (that actually sing country music and not country-rock). I just wish Time Life would put EVERY EPISODE on DVD!"
3,"Yes, Smothers Brothers","Sorry to disagree with William, but I remember being annoyed with them replacing Smothers Brothers with Hee Haw, and being pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Perhaps what he's remembering is a time slot difference in his area? I don't have the DVDs yet, so I can't speak to the quality of them, though I have no reason to doubt the other reviewers on that issue..."
1,praise the lord,"Praise the lord, it's dead and gone. Put a stake thruough its heart and scatter the ashes and let no child ever have to sit thru two hours on a Saturday night of this infernally painfully awful show. Still gives me the shivers. ""Heh, maybe we'll have some new jokes next week."" Maybe not. Hell is actors telling jokes that are charitably called corn-ball in a fake cornfield week after week after week. I used to pray that someone got 'is goldurn foot caught in a thresher."
3,looks good,I own many watches and this one does not disappoint. The picture does not truly capture the beauty of this time piece. The weight is good and looks good on the wrist. The only downside is that it is nearly impossible to read the date.
4,Very happy with product,I bought mine about 1-1/2 years ago and only paid about $230.00 for it at Circuit City. I have been very happy with it. I play music and my speakers seem just fine. For the money its been a really good product for me.
3,Low quality photos,"I have to admit I was a little dissapointed with this book. Many of the photos look like they were taken with an early generation digital camera and are of such poor quality that it is actually a distraction. That said, the material mostly consists of models in a performance art space, and is interesting and fun to see. Some are candid and behind the scenes or during a rehearsal, while others are ""live"". Normally, I would have given it 4 stars, but the low quality of half of the shots forced a 3."
5,A beautiful book,"I loved this book,I read it all in about an hour. The devotionals in here are very beautiful. I enjoyed the solar questions very much. This book goes by the four major Celtic holidays Samhain,Imbloc,Beltaine,and Lughnasadh. It has devotionals for each day and inside each season. They have extra devotionals at the end of the book."
3,The one in the picture...,"is NOT the one I received. I wanted one that would hang in my tea/coffee mug, but I received the longer one that you must squeeze to open. I suppose it will do the job, but since it cannot be completely dunked in the water, likely not."
4,Who Done It?,"This one for me was an incredibly quick and easy read. It was fun, and not nearly as dense as most of Wolfe's other works. It dealt with a story written by Holly Hollander, a younger woman who is caught up in some strange events when her mother brings home a strange box labeled ""Pandora"" which she auctions off the right to open and keep the contents during a fund raiser. As one would guess, opening up pandora's box is not exactly the wisest decision and events lead towards multiple deaths, including at least one murder and the eventual revelation of 'who done it'."
3,Just ok...,"There's plenty of useful information in here, but there are no photos and it's very lean on illustrations. I'd expect plenty of both in a book like this."
2,"Closet, Not Apartment, Therapy","After reading some of the reviews I bought the book. Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted my money because it failed to give me what I needed: good basic ideas to make my small apartment look better and somewhat stylish. Instead, the author offers some pretty cheesy-looking ideas that would be good for a dorm room. For anyone who needs more, look elsewhere. This book should have been titled ""Closet Therapy."""
3,No pictures,"I haven't even read this book yet, but I bought it for a gift and have just received it. Without having read it - just know, there are no pictures! It is printed on that cheap kind of paper, not glossy white. I thought it was going to be the type of book that is filled with great sample images of cool designs. Its probably not worth the effort returning it, but I don't think I will bother giving it as a gift.By the way, I bought this book because I love the AT website. It didnt live up, I should have gave it less stars."
2,No Pictures!!!,"This book is very lame. There are no pictures! Hellow!!! This is about making your home LOOK great, right? Not a single picture for inspiration! Dumb."
4,Thoughtful approach,"A thoughtful approach to the whys of remodeling and changing your space to suit yourself. Most books on decoration and home renovation don't cover the emotional impact these activities can have on you, it's an interesting discussion worth having and a different approach toward designing spaces for yourself than I've seen elsewhere."
4,Deeper than the average interior decorating book,"I had never really thought about the different types of people and how they are able or not able to decorate a home to their liking. It's interesting to think about the ways that our homes reflect problems in life, or even be the cause those problems. This book is inspiring not just for changing a home, but also for changing ones way of life.Maxwell definitely developed his methodology while tailoring to somewhat high-end style, but I feel like it also caters to the budget DIY type as well. I'm not a fan of retail therapy as a way to fix your life, and am more encouraged by the information about de-cluttering and getting to the heart of what makes your life a joyful one, and making your home a means to that end. For example, making your space awesome for entertaining so you can invite friends over and be more social."
1,Condescending clean-out-your-closet manual,"No useful interior design advice, a lot of stories about how cleaning your house will make you happy. Save your money."
4,Lunatic punk gypsy music,"This is just the cat's pajamas when I've come home from work, the events of the day are weighing heavy on me, and I need something boisterous and rebellious to lift my spirits. Plus it's all in a foreign language so the sad songs don't even make me sad. I heartily recommend this one."
5,Get this one,"""A l'affiche"" provides a wonderful overview of this excellent band from France. If you don't have a CD by Les Negresses Vertes, this will get you hooked on their great cafe sound. Included are a few remixes and cuts from their most excellent ""Acoustic Clubbing."""
5,Utterly unexpected,"When I first heard about this album I was simply not enthralled because I thought I knew what Caribou was all about. I was wrong. This album is nothing short of amazing and the first reviewer captured it perfectly. Sandy, Eli, Irene, Melody Day are some of my favorites but basically every track was damn good. The sound in this record is different and I like it. This record is pure dope!"
3,OK for altered states: boring 4 sober music-lovers,"I love Melody Day - and After Hours holds my interest. But the rest of the tracks remind me of music I'd listen to back when I'd waste days on end with my brains blown out on various drugs. Listening to Andorra after years in the land of substance-free living, most of the tracks sound derivative. They are missing the creative spark and inventiveness in Melody Day, a quality I now & crave notice thanks to more functional auditory, mental & perceptual faculties."
4,GREAT for light days,"I love the instruction of Tamilee, and even though her vids do not contain material for advanced exercisers to feel completely fatigued, I like the fact that on a ""slow day"" I can feel like I have accomplished something. This video is great in that area - the moves are great for the lower body, just squeeze while you are doing the moves!! The time flies, and I feel this is the perfect workout for a Friday, or for those days that you don't feel like, or just can't muster the energy for huffing and puffing.Most of the work is done on the step, and if you have bad knees, this is definitely not for you. The moves are mainly squats and lunges, with a little upper body mixed in.. I use 8 lb weights, and if nothing else, I feel that I at least get a little bit of heart rate increase with the moves. All in all, definitely worth the purchase.P.S. Make sure to stretch your legs on your own before this one, as she begins with the workout straight away without this..."
3,"Ok workout, but found it boring and tedious!","I like Tamilee's personality but her personality can't save this workout for me! There's no ""fun factor"". The moves are so basic (step up, step down) and you do one leg for what seems like forever before switching to the other side...it just went on and on. And I was using my step! I can't imagine how tedious and boring this one would have been without my step!Also? No chest OR back work! Just arms and legs...I prefer a strength/circuit workout to cover all the bases!I like Tamilee, but I didn't like this workout at all! Try ""I Want That Body"" instead...there's still no chest work, but at least you're done in 15 minutes!"
2,Weak,"My biggest complaint about this DVD is there is virtually no warm-up and an insufficient cool down. In addition, although you will break a sweat, the movements are very jerky, and at times very fast paced, although for short intervals. Its a fast workout right out of the box -- there is nothing to build up to. And, I could see how someone could seriously hurt themselves using this DVD by trying to keep up. The 10 minute abs is o.k. Another overall comment I have is she does not ease into things and explain them very well. I'm sure there must be better out there -- but this is not it. I doubt I'll use it again."
2,Nelco Steel Shot put,This steel shot put is supposed to be machined round and smooth. There were a few defects that could possibly cause problems with it passing inspection at tournaments. It is fine for practice.
3,OK but don't use the clip.,"When I got this case I thought it looked shart. The fit was perfect and the look excellent. The shine and smokey color complemented my Palm well. In fact it looked so good I didn't even want to use my gel suit I also bought. However, the clip looked like something of an afterthought. It was a bit loose and did not stay put very well. The phone is thick already and the clip was so large the whole thing stuck out too far. The phone fell off my belt already. I noticed the clip is held in place by a star-shaped plastic piece that is not part of the case. The piece is held by a small screw. Once I removed the screw the star piece came off. Now I can carry the phone in my pocket and it still looks nice. The clip was not the same color as the case either (it was lighter and didn't match at all). If you get this do what I did."
3,Draggin it out,"Well I haven't actually listened to this album, but I have seen them plenty o times since Kristen, the original vocalist, left the band. Since then, they have stepped down a few rungs on the lively ladder. There's just something missing from their new songs that Kristen had...as well as the rest of the bandmembers that left.Hopefully, they get their stuff together... man, i hope they have another peak coming.in the meantime, i would recommend a different album such as...1. love marble hoe down2. night of the porch people3. geodein order of my opinionated ranking"
3,Not bad.,Holds pistol with light very securely but doesn't stay clipped onto pants/belt quite as securely as I would have liked.
1,No illustrations...why??,I purchased this copy of an old book just so I could see the illustrator's work. There was absolutely no indication that they were not included in the copy. There was mention of the illustrator in the write-up and on the title page. Why was there this overt deception?? I would not purchase from this company again.
5,One of the best war movies ever made!,"This Russian war epic stands out. It's made by the same Russian film director who created the famous movie ""War and Peace"", Sergei Bondarchuk. The movie really makes you feel for the Russian soldiers fighting for their motherland."
3,"way overpriced, doesnt do much","My 5year old had to have this doll last year for Christmas, she got it then never really played with it. It didnt make a lot of noises (a plus for mom but not so much for a little girl that wants a cooing baby)It would be OK if it wasnt 35 bucks as it didnt come with anything."
2,not as good as advertised on t.v.,"My daughter recieved this for her 4th birthday and it was one of the things she asked for, it looked very, very good on t.v. , she played with it for about 2 minutes, it doesn't do much, crys and lights up when she drinks her bottle, its a better looking doll then one that actually does anything that even entertains a 4 year old and it was NOT worth the price of 30 bucks in any way, shape or form...."
5,We LOVE THIS DOLL!,I bought these dolls for my 4 yr old twins for Xmas and we just love them. I had no idea how fun she was until we got her unwrapped. she lights up like crazy and makes the most realistic baby sounds i've ever heard on a doll. The bottle feeding is soo fun. My daughters and I have played with them non-stop. We got the matching crib set to go with her as well and its adorable. I highly recommend this doll to parents with toddler's. Its the perfect princess doll for your little princess :)
1,This book is lacking in many areas,"I am a high school student who used Garraty's ""The American Nation"" as the primary textbook this year in my AP U.S. History class. I found this book to be dry and drawn out, and in addition, it did not seem to elaborate on some of the more intricate topics as much as it should have. I often needed to refer to many outside sources to educate myself on topics. The thing that bothered me the most was that its index was lacking and the book didn't even have a glossary-- some textbook this is! While Garraty managed to stick a few humorous and lively sentences into the text, my recommendation is that unless a teacher wants to put his class to sleep, use another book."
1,I dislike this book very much,"Unfortunatly this book does not recount American history. It is a 1076 paged book of Mr. John A. Garraty's interpretations and opinions of American History. The writing is confusing, and drawn out. There is one particular sentence that has caused great debate in my AP US History. My biggest complaint: there are important concepts that are mentioned but are not defined. For example: Thomas Jefferson's ""pell-mell"" approach to his presidency. This is not a good book to use in AP US History classes. My advice, find someting else."
2,Summary of The American Nation,"I am a high school student in AP US History, and have just finished outlining the entire book. It was a great source, and didn't leave too much out of the picture."
1,Worst History Book in a long time,"Even as a lover of history, I find this book boring, overwritten and incable of reliable use. When looking up a term, not only can it not be found by reading the chapter, but the index points you to the wrong page! This book is a waste of money and I suggest that you do not purchase it."
2,Poor,"This book is filled with too much details and words. It takes too much effort to just read and understand the details in each chapters. It is boring to read and the only good thing about it is that it comes with alot of datas in the American history. If you are a History major, don't miss it."
4,A So Far Unsurpassed Survey of US History,"I, like many others, used this text in my high school AP US History class. I found the text readable and occasionally entertaining the first time through. Garraty's book came with me to college and has served me well as I have nearly completed my work for a minor in History. If you are not already familiar with the best overview of US history, do yourself a favor an pick up a copy... It could serve you well for a long time."
5,The best text for AP U.S. History,"Kudos to Garraty for his newest edition. I was a student in AP US History and thoroughly enjoyed the book. I received a 5 on the AP exam (highest possible score ranked 1-5). I wholeheartedly recommend the text to anyone serious about succeeding in AP US History or if you just want to refresh your knowledge of US History. Within the American Nation, you will find all sorts of ancedotes told by a preeminent raconteur. If you can not remember the ""Sumner-Brooks"" affair, you will enjoy reading Garraty's skilled account of that affair to remember."
5,Best Latin Hip Hop CD EVER!,"This has to be the best Latin Hip Hop CD I have bought ever! I cant describe how great this cd is! I am totally addicted to it, and if u get it, you will be addicted to!"
1,Mother Love,I am sure some people would enjoy this book of potery. They are much to abstract for my likes. I perfer a move traditional type of potery.
2,No dimensions,Wanted to buy it. But it does not provide the dimensions. Hard to purchase without knowing the size especially that I had a bad experience in the past when I bought a bowl which looked much bigger in the picture than what it actually was when delivered
1,This movie makes me sick,"This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen! There's only about 5 sets used in the ENTIRE 2 hours, only about 2 or 3 different songs or whatever on the soundtrack, at MOST 5 minutes of action out of the 2 hours, and the plot is pathetic, almost nonexistant, and frankly makes me physically nausious. In short, SPARE YOURSELF!"
1,The Worst Movie Ever - hehe,"This is a F grade movie. I mean, COME ON! ""Water... on the rocks."" The bartender gets threatened all the time but never actually killed. And, of course, ""You're fast. Real fast."" doo doo... [ZOOOOOM IN] doo doo... [Droid-guy's face] doo doo... [OD's face] doo doo... [repeat for five minutes] doo doo... SWIIZSZH!The actual fight takes place in about one second.Ah, and I return again to the classic...""Water... on the rocks.""'Nuff said."
5,a good book for fluid dynamic,This book contains a lot of details and introduce the fuild dynamic in a good way. Good for graduate student and undergraduate student who want to learn more in this subject.
5,An excellent introduction in Fluid Mechanics,"One of the best introduction books in thisfield. This new edition has a chapter onBiofluid Mechanics. Over all, it is interestingand fun to read."
5,Very good textbook !,"As a master in mechanical engineer, and working with technical education, I had studied most of the more popular textbooks on fluid mechanics before, and get used not to expect many from ""new"" textbooks on the subject.Although, when I came across this book, it was a little surprise. The text is very well written, and includes many advanced and interesting topics not found in other popular textbooks. It gives emphasis to qualitative explanation, and does not overwhelm you with lots of mathematics. The approach to subjects is very clever, insightful and meaningful.I dare to say it renewed my pleasure in reading, studying and teaching fluid mechanics. Thanks and congratulations to Professor Kundu."
5,Wonderfully clear explanations.,"This book is amazing. While accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of physics, it is nonetheless a complete introduction to the science of fluid mechanics. It manages to give clear, complete explanations of concepts, while avoiding much of the tedious algebra and dry style of, say, Batchelor. Don't get me wrong though--Kundu is not lacking in rigor. As a first text to learn fluid mechanics from, to my knowledge, Kundu has no equal."
3,"Comprehensive Book, but very sloppy editing with mistakes","This book is very comprehensive and covers all of the major aspects of fluid mechanics. However, there are several mistakes in this book. Some of the problem solutions are wrong, but above all, the equations are often referenced incorrectly. This can make it quite frustrating for students, especially when they haven't figured out that they are being misled."
2,Not a great choice for students,"This book is not a great resource for a student. There are few examples, and the exercises at the end of each chapter are short and not very diverse. The exercises also have no solutions, not a big deal but the text has few examples.If you just need a reference this book is ok, but please don't teach from it!"
2,Problems with genre,"Like the other negative review, I have issues with the first episode on the DVD. I ran into the same problem with the ""Jaguar Day"": magic blended with science. If a series like ""Go, Diego, Go"" builds itself up as science-based, with great information and lessons about nature, it should remain grounded in reality. True, the animals do talk, but it is easier for a 2 or 3 year-old to process this flight of fancy than it is for them to understand the fantastical when it is interwoven with factual representations of animals and wildlife, with no indication that one is real and one is imagined."
2,Magically Weird,"I bought this DVD for my 1.5 year old daughter, who loves Diego. She enjoys this DVD tremendously so for that reason I give it two stars. However, the first two episodes (this DVD contains a total of four episodes) are just too bizarre. In the first, a shape-shifting magic man steals a flying flute by turning into any animal he wants. In the second, Diego's grandfather's strawberry farm is saved by the green iguana, who poops out strawberry seeds to replenish the fields. I usually skip to the third and fourth episodes, which are undersea adventures with whales and octupuses."
3,"It DON'T explain the writing code, but machine itself","This book is not appropriate to expert of hardware or firmware programming. Absolutely not for software programmer.This book explains the introduction of various hardware and that is more specific than we can read from megazine.If you are really Expert of embedded programming, this book will reminds you the basic stuff of hardware which you might use. BUT it is almost useless if you are Expert.If you are college student, you will get the various information of computer related hardware. It WILL be helpful."
5,"Tres bon, Miss Seeton!","Plummergen, that ""peaceful"" village in Kent where Miss Seeton resides, is currently the center of three exciting activities. One, a local charity group is sponsoring a drive to buy wheelchairs for children, Two, The construction of the channel tunnel is inspiring a visit to France, and Three, Mrs. Blaine and Miss Nuttel (the Nuts) have a visitor. Guess which topic is generating the most discussion?All seems quiet on the Miss Seeton front, at least, and the book is deceptively crime-free for the first half or more. But murder eventually strikes, and all that peace and quiet is bound to come to a spectacular end. It's enough to put Anglo-French relations back 20 years!I really enjoy this series. I love Miss Seeton and her crazy neighbors crack me up. Really funny."
3,"Not The Best, But It Is Ok","It is not like Master P's style, but it is still a good song. You can't diss anything that P does, come on people."
1,I HATE P,"DAM* HE BITES PAC 2 MUTCH IF U DONT NO THIS SONG THE HOOK IS STOLEN FROMTUPAC - ""IF I DIE TONIGHT"" OFF OF ME AGENST THE WORLD""Fu** BITERS LET THE MANE REST IN PEACE"
4,Slippers are a little slippery,Slippers are cute but no support on the bottom. More like a sock. For the price I was still pleased and wear them at home a lot
3,The highest regarded greatest Bills coach to write so well*,"Extremely hokey and a tad bit hurried through the end, but a pretty good book covering his life of football. *Mr. Levy really needs to lay off the use of superlatives as almost every player or team he has coached was the greatest at one particular thing or another. Also, I don't think Mr. Levy intended that the descriptions he has written regarding his locker room motivational speeches were to betray the fact that the players most likely considered the gravely serious war metaphors that he was constantly drawing on as a little too serious to be applied to a football game. No wonder why they consistently fell silent as he left them to contemplate his words. I can hear in my mind a player asking another ""Like, we're playing a game here, right?"" as Marv proudly leaves the locker room. Marv comes off as a classy guy hoping to coach again. I hope he gets his wish."
3,Fine,"This was OK. It's instructional and the couples are attractive. It works well to watch with your lover. I can't picture an adult man watching this by himself unless it was already lying around, but it is a good video."
2,Too Cute For Words,This plushie is just too cute. He is nicely made and very soft. He just makes you want to hug him. I got him as a gift for my friend in N.Y. But he did stayed with me for a few days. I would definilately buy one for myself. And he is relativily inexpensive compared to some plushies I've seen. Don't expect this price at a Con. I highly recommend this plushie for any Gravitation fan.
5,Bell Brush,Ordered for my son and he loves if. Works great for his alto saxophone. Item was bought and sold thru Amazon.
2,Not Essential!,"This product is not essential at all! It barely feels like its cleaning anything, and it doesnt reach all the way to the curved bottom! I easily forget to take it out and it renders me from playing. Over all it is a big nuissense!"
2,did not work for me,This shoe runs very narrow in mediums. I usually wear a medium but this felt more like a AA. Had to send it back. Unfortunately the Peltz Customer Service Rep informed me that I had to do so at my own expense which was very costly. They were not willing to meet me half way.
1,DON'T,"Not a good book on dim mak ... Childish techniques , and no connaisance of chinese medicine principles . Only two god infos on this book..."
4,Great book but one book won't make you a ninja.,"A good book to own if you want to brush up on your self-defense skills. Very well-organized and thought out. But as with all martial arts books, DO NOT ASSUME YOU ARE A MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE READ THIS BOOK. It covers a good range of techniques but anyone who says that this book alone helped them win a fight is either lying or very lucky. The techniques the book shows are solid techniques but unless you have taken some martial art in the past or are currently taking one now use this book for reference or information only. It always helps to have a live person to ask and help you improve your technique."
2,Impractical,"Hei Long has one binding characteristic to all of his books: he takes advantage of the ignorant, giving low quality info behind interesting titles. His books are the epitome of the adage, ""Never judge a book by its cover"", although the word TITLE would better fit with Hei Long. He presents some of the most impractical teachings I have ever seen, perpetuating myths and further holding back the martial arts world in a sea of ignorant aspiring students."
5,Great Amercian Pie Company,"A reprinting of a funny little tale. Purchased because one of my uncles and my grandfather, Ernest Hill, kiddingly called their company TGAPC...but they were successful."
4,Story the whole family can enjoy,"Little Ellie Claus is a charming, whimsical story the whole family will enjoy. Kids will find the story a suspenseful blend of fantasy and reality. Adults will get a kick out of the author's witty, unconventional vision of the North Pole, where the likes of Plato, Van Gogh and Einstein rub elbows with the elves. This would make a super gift for Christmas, or better yet to read as a family as Christmas approaches."
2,Fashion Jewelry to Make Yourself,While Fashion Jewelry has interesting examples for making handsome and contemporary objects -- mostly necklaces -- the translation is terrible. Just because someone has the ability to make a literal translation doesn't mean they are competent to deal with even this minimally specialist technique and subject.
2,Not a real guide.....,"Lots of pretty designs, but in my opinion none are useful for the average shell collector. Most designs are over the top too much."
1,Too Gaudy,"Not at all what I expected from reading reviews. Way too gaudy for my tastes (a shell covered vertebrae, pg. 89...what's that about?)Nothing useful or tasteful in this garish tome. Only plus is that I didn't pay the original $35.00 list price.Shell Chic: The Ultimate Guide to Decorating Your Home With Seashells"
2,Look through it in person first.....,"I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making. Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate. Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book. Try to find ""Decorating with Seashells"" by Anita Louise Crane"
3,An ejoyable but novice book.,"All the excitement expressed by other reviews is there, but the author is clearly a novice in naval warfare. By the end of the book, the hyperventilation is out of control and we are treated to a painful explanation as to why these little boats would have been a more formidable match against the Soviet Mediterrenean fleet than the US 6th Fleet would have been...KP"
4,Hobbit & Rings set,"Matching set, good quality cover, came in a case which was a nice surprise. Print not the greatest quality, but good value as a set for my child to dig in."
2,lots of twisting for a little pepper,"I bought this item to grind large quantities of pepper when I cook. This model is used on at least one cooking show and it makes pepper grinding look quick and easy. After opening the box and loading it up with pepper corns, I realized that each turn of the handle doesn't grind much pepper. I then read the instructions and saw...""5 full turns will grind 1/2 teaspoon"" This makes this unusable as I would have to twist my hand off for 2 tablespoons. I will continue to use ground pepper from the supermarket till I can find a better solution."
1,It broke within 6 months!,I loved the Peppermate until it broke! It was a great cooking tool. I had seen Barefoot Contessa use it and needed something to grind pepper for cooking. A piece of plastic inside the grinder broke off and now it won't work.
4,Mechanism,"This is my second Pepper Mate Mill. The original I gave to my daughter, and I had excellent experience with it for 10 or more years. I prefer the original because it had a metal grinder and shaft. The new one I recently purchased has ceramic grinder/mechanisms that I (so far) am not pleased with."
1,peppercorns all over the place,"this is the worst pepper mill i have ever used -- not that it doesn't grind pepper, but that it is so poorly designed that it is quite easy to spill peppercorns all over the floor and into whatever it is you are seasoningpeppermills are generally secure in holding their valuable contents...this one is not....it seems to be fine for people who don't cook....but anyone who has watched 200 peppercorns go into a soup or bowl of meatball mix will be disappointed with this overhyped product"
5,Best Pepper Mill around!,"This is by far my favorite pepper mill. I love that I can either hold the pepper mill over a dish and grind the pepper in directly, or I can grind the pepper into the self contained portion of the pepper mill and then measure out what I need. This is a terrific product!"
5,GREAT GREAT gREAt,"This book was great. this was the first first love stories book ive read so far, and its great. It made me laugh, cry and think.Max and Jane make a great couple. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes love stories."
2,Dated. FAR from their best.,"It's old, dated and not very good at all. I love Xymox and their later albums are FAR better than this. It's all pompous, self agonising nonsense with a pretty low production level. If you find it cheap as a 2nd hand give it a go if you must. NOT worth buying new. Trust me, don't be tempted! Notes From The Underground, Xymox Live and Creatures blow this old junk into the abyss. This can be viewed as a demo disc but that's about it. FAR too much boring sampling and clanking noise."
4,"Forward Thinking, Edgey, an Impressive Debut!","Most people who were attuned to the dance scene of the mid to late 80s would recognize both ""Stranger"" and ""A Day"" as two staples of any DJ's Vinyl 45 collection, and yet no one seems to lift an eyebrow at the album's second string songs--""No Words"" and ""Equal Ways"" are two of Xyomox's best pieces. These two songs just by themselves are worth the price of the album. Other Notables: the catchy ""Muscoviet Mosquito"" and the dirge-like ""No Human can Drown"". Buy it. It'll make you a believer."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought this mainly for Rook, but sometimes play the other games too. The most annoying thing about this package is that you must have the CD in the drive to play. I understand that it's for copy protection, but it's very irritating if you want to load it onto your laptop for travel. Most games have some interesting variations (Rook has classic, tournament, and Red One), but if Atari and Hasbro had really thought it through they could have allowed more variation for house rules, like some PC versions of Monopoly do. No apparent differences in the computer players either, beyond the silly animations. The tutorial feature is a nice touch. Pretty basic stuff, but a good buy for under $10."
1,Wish I could play it!,"First a disclaimer - I didn't buy this game from Amazon, but I have two copies already and both do not on an computer with XP. I got it, and then tried again, because I love the card games and don't have anyone to play with now. However, I can only play once per installation, after that it doesn't move from the beginning page to the game. Lovely when it works, but I don't have time to un/reinstall every time I want to play!The 'product description' is for another collection, no relationship to this particular one which includes a bunch of Parker Brothers card games like Racko, Rook, Mille Bornes, and some classic standards, and a set of MB classic board games."
4,First played twenty years ago!,This game came out in the early 90's and was a lot of fun then and it still is a lot of fun! Check compatability before you buy. Have Fun!!!
3,"Lackluster, but an ok read","Killer Babes chronicles some of the noted women murderers throughout the years. Women killers, seem to fascinate people, as you don't really think of women as sadistic killers. This book has everything from teenagers to older women committing violent murderous acts. From poison ,dismemberment, to frozen body parts.The writing is so so and will capture your attention. As for keeping it, well that's another story. The stories start out strong but seem to fade fast. The pictures are pretty graphic, and you might need a strong stomach.If you must read this, do so. But, I don't think you will miss anything if you just walk on by it in the bookstore, or click the back button online."
3,"Scary, but gory",This book was frightening because you knew that these stories were true... the book did tend to lean a bit towards the gory side though.
5,Hellcat running wild!,"A great collection of female-fueled mayhem! Who would suspect that women could be so brutal... oh, wait, I guess husbands would. Just kidding dear, now please... put the knife down."
2,I like leather better,Purchase this to use with my 2.5 in .38 Special but it was not comfortable probably because im not privvy to having such a had object on my hip. Im more accustomed to leather rigs that are attached to my tactical belt..to each their own.
4,Did not fit,"Would not fit my 357 Magnum. My revolver is considered a ""L"" frame and is a 6 round cyl. The holster will not accept that size cyl. I was told that the 5 round will work just fine."
3,Didn't work as expected.,Holster was too difficult to draw from. It certainly held the pistol securely but tended to come off my belt with the gun. I returned it.
2,Made well but can not retrieve your fire arm effectively.,"Good price and made well, except for release principle. I bought this for my wife and it really is not effective for personal carry. She can't retrieve the fire arm at all and I can barely. The quote ""snapping"" action thing just does not work. It really holds the fire arm effectively, but not good if you can't get it out. Was a big disappointment for me."
3,"I loved this holster, but my wife didn't","Bought this for my wife for conceal carry. Was WAY too tight, but I was convinced it could loosen up. She didn't want it so I had to return it."
1,"Bad product, worse warranty","I purchased the proper Fobus holster for my S&W; revolver. However, the product did not work properly; the gun was hard to get in and harder to draw. Fobus has a well-known ""No Questions Asked"" warranty/return policy. Per their website, an RMA number will be issued and any defective product will be replaced without question. Period. Simple, right? No. When apprised of my problem, the customer service person said that I had to deal with the entity I purchased the holdter from (Amazon). He refused to honor the warranty, using the example that if I purchased a TV from a big-box store, I'd have to retun it to them, not them maker. Great example ...?The product was purchased new. It was clearly defective. Fobus completely denied their warranty obligation. There are many other honest makers who offer a similar product . I suggest that you patronize them instead of Fobus.Thanks to Amazon who did accept my return, even they were not obligated to do so."
5,Challenging and fun!,"Our 6 year old loves tangrams, and we had a set of Tangoes for him. My husband and I quickly became addicted. When the single set was no longer a challenge, we upped the ante with Double Tangoes. So far, it's still challenging and so much fun! I just love low tech games that require you to THINK. This game definitely qualifies."
3,Nuno Bettencourt still experimenting,"When I got this album I was expecting another Schizophonic (Nuno's lastest release) but I was wrong, This album is completely different to Schizo and shows that Nuno has been experimenting some more since he got out of Extreme. the album has heavy moments, funky moments and even a slow song called ""True Love in the Galaxy"" where Nuno shows how he is getting into electronic music. My favorite moments on this CD are ""Hotel Asylum"", ""Love is a Cigarette"" and ""True Love in the Galaxy"", while production is not as good as ""Schizophonic"" Nuno developed nicer vocals. Also this album has more guitar solos, but most of them sound improvised (which I didnt like), also you'll find catchy choruses, you know Nuno is good at that."
5,BETTER THAN SCHINDLER'S LIST,I disagree with the previous reviewers. This movie was far better than Schlinder's List. For me it was more emotionally moving than Spielberg's List. In fact as far as I am concerned it makes Spielberg look like an amature. I also think Spielberg may have stolen the little girl's red coat idea from this movie. After seeing this movie I was so turned on that I checked out 2 biographies of Wallenberg from the library. The movie was very faithful to the biographies.
3,Chris's review,"I bought this as a gift for my niece who is studying Russian at University. She appreciated the gift. It looked like a wonderful video. Like most young adults, my niece has not shared her response to the film. She did request the video, so I think she has great expectations of it.I hope that this completely vacuous review has made your day!"
1,Grim,"This film is a portrial of all the evil, fear and pyschological depression and destruction of the holocost without any of the redeeming effects of the heroic efforts of Rauol Wallenberg."
2,Shindler's List is King!,"Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg has a great premise, but horrible filmmaking. The special effects are cheesy - there's no blood when the people are shot, which is totally bogus. Also, the copy that I received (which is being sold as authentic) is a cheap reproduction of a VHS tape (so it appears). The sound is horrible. The image is pixelated, and it freezes when you try to rewind it. This movie sucks a big doo-doo man! Don't ever, ever, ever in your life compare it to the likes of Steven Spielberg's 'Shindler's List'."
4,Pistola Pictures,"This is a powerful film! Anyone interested in the remarkable sacrifice made by Raoul Wallenberg so that thousands of Jews during the siege of Budapest Hungary might be saved, should see this film.[...]"
3,A bit confusing...,"This movie may be a bit confusing to someone (like me) who does not know the history of Raoul Wallenberg. However, the movie improves upon a second viewing."
4,Viking Warrior-Viking Hersir 793-1066,"This book has some good illustrations for re-enactors to make replica weapons, but you should know that this is just a re-release of Osprey's Viking Hersir 793-1066 AD. This release has a different title and different cover, so I was misled into buying it again, but I am returning it. If you don't have Viking Hersir, I suggest you get this book. It's not very in depth, but does give a good overview of various aspects of the Viking warrior."
3,"A Good, But Narrow View","Link's book is well written and is a very interesting account of one segment of Chinese life during the early years of China's reform process. However, it is also very narrow, looking at the circumstances of the elite intellectuals and occassionally overstating his, or his close Chinese friends, importance or experiences. The book doesn't come to address the conditions or lives of the typical urban citizen of Beijing or any other Chinese city and thus is lacking. It seems Link just took much of his personal interaction with Chinese intellectuals and turned it into a book. Overall, he is successful in capturing the experiences of many Chinese who went overseas to study and returned in the late 1980s, though circumstances have changed a lot since then. Further, he is able to capture much of the discontent among intellectuals which ultimately becomes the base of the Tiananmen protests."
1,Unable to view in DVD Player,"When I put the DVD in my DVD player I got a NO DISC error message even after trying several times. I then put the DVD in my computer was it was able to load. I wanted to watch the DVD on the large screen not a 12"" monitor so I was very disappointed. I will keep the DVD because I haven't seen anything else on Cuba and I don't feel like packaging it up to return. I have not yet watched the DVD. The DVD has a purple color to it on the side that gets read and I wonder if that is why my player couldn't recognize it."
2,JAG Season 8,"This is the second time I have ordered a JAG DVD set from Amazon. Both times there has been an issue with at least 1 of the dvd in the set. I have ordered all other sets from Borders and there were no problems. So although your customer service people were friendly and accomodating and set up a quick replacement, I have to question whether or not I will re-oder in the future.Thank you."
1,Had to return due to missing Discs,I received duplacte of Discs One & Two and package was missing Discs Three & 4. Therefore had to return the item.
5,Fabulous series,Absolutely fabulous. I have all eight seasons now. I was very sorry to hear that the series was cancelled. I loved it.
2,:(,I only got this for NCIS first appearance. I do not like this show. I did watch some of the other episodes and did not enjoy them.
5,jag season 8,"It was exactly as I expected Great!!! You can't go wrong watching this dvd set. I just love JAG, wish it was still in production."
5,JAG S8 a must have,I absolutely love JAG so how could I be disappointed. Although i do wish that they were put more extra's on the DVD rather than just bloopers.
5,Authentic and addicting,"The show is so addicting and well made it became my favorite show in no time. Catherine Bell is gorgeous!I even named my first born after David James Elliotts character and named him Harmon! Cool and unique name.If you want accurate, exciting, and a nail biting show, this is it.They even had a NAVY liason working with them to ensure accuracy.Trust me. Buy it and all other seasons."
2,Not finish friendly,"I purchased this holster for a Smith and Wesson M&P full size 9mm with a Crimson Trace Railmaster Laser. When the gun is holstered it fits like a glove. However, getting the firearm in & out of the holster is not only somewhat difficult but hard on the finish of the gun. Afer only 3-4 times of putting the gun in the holster & removing it, it wore the finish from the SS slide. If you don't care about holster wear only after a few days then this is the holster for you. I understand holster wear over time but the hard surface of the holster combinded with metal rivets making direct concact with your gun is simply bad design. I am returning it."
4,Very good book but needs updating,"This book is very useful for people like me who are trying to find out the manufacturer of an IC so that they can then locate a manufacturer's data sheet for it. I especially like the logo section because it allows for fast identification. However, the book is now dated (1996) and should be updated every 5 yrs or so to keep it current. A revised version is sorely needed. This book is indispensible for electronic technicians and hobbyists like myself who work on a variety of different consumer electronics."
4,The duo Creates Magic,"Music album comprises of melodious hits of Jagjit Singh. The Ghazal King Jagjit Singh is undoubtedly one of the most well known Ghazal Singer in the world today. He has come out with innumerable collections of Ghazals and Bhajans, all of them winners. Lyrics of Javed Akhtar are truly remarkable. His lyrics are very powerful. Jagjit Singh sings Ghazals like a human breathes."
5,"Given as a gift, the recipient rated it highly",The recipient is of the left-liberal (socialist) persuasion and liked it a lot. I'm a anarcho-free market (Rothbardian) libertarian and I liked it based on the reviews.
4,"Not fast paced or a page turner, but enjoyable","The interesting feature of this book is that it takes place (for the most part) during the Blitz of London, but the Blitz is not obviously central to the plot. Characters are interesting, but not as well-developed as I would like. Perhaps that takes place in later volumes. So, not a nail-biter, but enjoyable and unexpected."
4,Enjoyable in the Golden Age vein,"A long book, but one that keeps your interest. It jumps back and forth between modern day London and London in 1940 during the blitz. Most of the story is set in 1940, and that was certainly more interesting, and more golden age-ish. As well as the mystery surrounding weird murders in a huge theater, the evocation of London being bombed was very effective."
5,Full Dark House,"Wow! This was fun! The combination of the theater, Greek myth and the Blitz all at once makes for a cracking, good read. The several main characters are appealing - you root for their success against the forces of darkness..."
5,A Brilliant Series,I have read all of them so far and I have this to say: none of the books disappoint. They are intelligently written with wonderfully quirky characters and very intriguing plots. Very little in the books is gratuitous. I think these are really best suited for those who enjoy books that are not simply brain candy.
4,What I expected.,"Buying used books, I usually expect them to be pretty tattered, and then when they come looking brand new, I am pleasantly surprised. This book wasn't in mint condition, but they didn't claim it would be. So I am pretty happy."
3,Not his best,"Although a good read, I can't help but think that Christopher Fowler is going the same way as the other British authours I love like James Herbert and Shaun Hutson. The stop writing their quirky horror-ish novels for more mainstream thriller mysteries. Yes, this story certainly has it's moments and his loveable characters of Bryant and May stand out as well as any crime fighting team, but the story lacks suspense and I found myself not caring enough about the characters for the final outcome."
1,WHY so pricey?,I'd like to try these novels but why are the Kindle prices so high? Why should I pay $4.00 more than the paperback price for the Kindle version of an 8-year-old novel? I appreciate that novelists want to make money -- but the pricing of paperbacks versus e-books needs work.
1,"Slow, pedantic and pseudo-everything","If you don't mind ""new age"" pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific and pseudo-historical fad ""intellectualism"" and you don't mind skipping pages and pages of slow moving empty dialogue, knock yourself out. If you prefer fast-paced ""London"" based mysteries try Will Thomas' new books instead."
3,An interesting new series.,"What an interesting use of contrasts. Fowler brings to life 1940s London during the Blitz offset by the Millennium Eye; the chaos of the streets during the Blitz and the insularity of a theatre; traditional police procedure versus use of a medium; a difficult, quirky detective offset by a personable classic investigator. I felt the plot was overly complex and the story slow at times, but I was held in the story by the strong writing, humor, and the relationship between the two protagonists. I look forward to reading the next book in this series."
4,OHMYGOSH!,"Hound... Hound, Hound, Hound, Hound... How I love this Transformer! He was my favorite in the show and now we get a Masterpiece-Scale Alternators figure with show acurate features (okay, maybe not perfect but give him a break, IT'S HOUND!) He has rubber tires, chrome, clear plastic headlights and windhiselds, a flip-up faction symbol, and a hidden gun compartment in his spare tire holder. The only thing he does not have is a shoulder cannon! His articulation is terrific and his features are spot-on!Keep in mind, this is an Alternator, a dead line to most, and as such he has some bits that can fall off or break. Do not get this for your five year old. In fact, don't get it for your thirteen year old either! Get it for the eighteen year old who still collects Transformers. He will have the reverence to take care of the toy properly. Not to say he is filled with breaky-bits, but he isn't the SMASH AND BASH toy that your five year old needs. Get them a WALK AND TALK robot instead."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this CD after seeing here on Amazon. Since it had no track listing I had no idea what to expect. I had hoped it would be a collection of the 12"" single versions of Benatar's hits. It was not. It is a collection of live versions of some of her work from her first three albums. Not that bad, but very misleading since most of the songs are not extended at all. It would have helped is there was listing of the tracks so that Amazon buyers would know what they were getting."
3,Some great live performances - some not so great,"I am not a huge fan of Pat's but I do love some of her hits. This cd was a hit & miss for me, but the songs I bought it for were great and the ""live"" element made them even more enjoyable.I wish we could get another female like Pat Benetar in our music world, but the original will be the best."
4,Live and it Rocks,"This is collection of 10 well recorded live tracks released by BMG Special Products. Released in 2000, it does not state any dates or locations for the performances, but it appears to include performances from more than one evening. The extended cut of ""In The Heat of the Night"" is the best version of this song I have ever heard. I have several ""Extended Versions"" CDs from BMG, and they always pick excellent live recordings. I only wish they would give some detail on WHEN and WHERE these tracks were recorded."
1,"Useless, THE CD is missing","Dust collector on the shelf . Withuot the CD is useless. Ido not know how canI get my mony back????I have to have the CD,Regards Les"
4,'Ich Gehe Jetzt' ist fantastisch!,"A couple of fantastic songs on this album, and for those who like the air-compressor sounds used you've got to listen to the Blue Man Group or see one of their shows. Those guys have been using PVC tubes for many years and this album of EN reminds me a lot of BMG's recordings. Still there's nothing better than a live EN show with NU crashing cans all over the stage or Alex Hacke playing guitar with a vibrator! Still I agree with another reviewer that there is a very distinct hole in the band since FM Einheit left. His and Mark Chung's presence on stage alone were incredible, much less what they brought to the recordings."
3,It's alright - typical of Neubauten these days,While I must admit I love the idea that the fans really made this album for parting with their cash to let Neubauten make their album - it seems a little bit of a disappointment this album. While I'm amazed at the instrumentation each and every time with Neubauten - I feel the lyrics are a little silly and perhaps a little bit over-pretentious ( that is if Selbstportrait mit Kater isn't about having a hangover after a night on the towns and just about the galaxy and all that spacy stuff ). It's still easier to digest than Silence is Sexy but it's not an overall complete success. Ozean Und Brandung is however a lovely instrumental - it's just I would like to see more instrumentals but howandever I didn't pay my way so that's my problem!Oh well maybe next time ( if there is one )

A simple basic training manual for anyone who wants to clean windows, to the point and for a reasonable price. Written for anyone whom wants to get into the business of window cleaning with a limited amount of money to spend."
1,"Unimaginative, repetetive and anoying...","I tried really hard to like this CD, listened over and over wishing it will grow on me... Nidless to say it never did. The reason is simple: it's just imposible to like this CD. Almost all remixes sound alike; some songs don't need to be remixed (sound better original:#5 and6), some songs shouldn't be remixed (songs are borring or plain out bad: #2 and 4). My bigest problem with DFA remixes on this particular item is: most of the rems are toooooooooo long. The most horrifying experience was #4 She wants to move. Besides being an average song, remix is unimaginative, repetetive and downright anoying. It seems like they just remixed it on home made software and looped it for five-six repits. At some point I was close to just trowing this CD away. Even relatively better choise of songs for stronger finish of this disastros ""chapter two"" doesnt save it."
1,This book is really a piece of trash to be used as a coaster,I was very disapointed when I spent $4.00 on this book.For one the discriptions are lame and chessy.Whoever wrote this book has no imagination.It also practaically nothing to do with the movie.I wouldnt even recomend this book to my worst enemy.
3,Stings eyes like a mad hornet,"My overall feeling about this moisturizer is positive... or, well, it would be if it didn't somehow manage to always migrate into my eyes and sting like crazy, no matter how careful I am to avoid my eye area (disappointing, because that is the only area on my face where I have lines). Maybe I am just a bona fide freak, but I swear I have never had this problem with any other moisturizer. It's crazy. I normally use Oil of Olay for Sensitive Skin, which also stings a bit if it gets in my eyes because of the sunscreen, but it doesn't... creep, or migrate... the way this lotion does. I seriously don't understand it.Other than that, it has a nice consistency and a fairly innocuous smell, and it does leave my skin very soft. I just cant use it because of the horrible, horrible burning."
5,Love it,I love this moisturizer. It is not greasy at all and has a pleasant smell. I'm also using the positively ageless daily scrub.
1,stains,"because of the spf i use it as my outdoor lotion, to my surprise the area that i had applied that touched clothes i.e. leg shirt collar stained yellowish orange. after a few washings still can not get it off the clothing... not sure if it is this product or a reaction with sweat + this product + cotton fiber.....I guess this product is good if your planning on going out naked"
1,Positively Peely,"I generally love Aveno products, but I have had the weirdest experience with this moisturizer. Besides burning my eyes if it gets anywhere near them, the lotion itself actually peels. If I run my finger over my face, it's as if my skin were rubbing off after a sunburn. The little moist rolls it leaves makes it impossible to wear under makeup, which is why I bought it. Even if I didn't wear foundation, though, why would I want a lotion that balls up on me and leaves what looks like bits of dead skin all over my face?I'm returning it."
1,Positively disappointed!,"I've only been using this product for about a week and a half, but I have decided that is more than enough! I can clean my face religiously before putting this on, but whenever I do put it on it somehow collects and rubs off in pieces! The weirdest thing I've ever seen, really. The smell is too much like sunscreen, though much milder and you sort of get used to it. This product made my face break out and I also noticed many more blackheads, even in places I NEVER get them!! When cleaning my face from this product as well, there's an insurmountable level of dirt! I've also noticed dry patches on my skin that were never there before. Very unusual.I've used other Aveeno moisturizers before, and other than switching moisturizers I have not changed anything else in my routine. The other moisturizers have never even come close to doing things like this, and I have to say that I am very disappointed in this product. I will never buy it again, and I will warn friends against it."
2,Not happy at all,"I had hopes for this moisturizer because I usually love Aveeno products. However, I have been sorely disappointed. First, it feels more like suncreen than it does a moisturizer. Secondly, and most irrating to me, I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have had the worst acne break outs I've experienced in a long time. Today I woke up with more pimples, and I've decided I've had enough...it's going in the trash."
1,Burning Eyes,"This product is terrible. After washing out my eyes several times, my eyes are still burning 12 hours later. It is not cheap either. What a waste!"
1,Burns eyes horribly,"I use Clinique Dramatically Different during the summer but when the dry Arizona winter hits, I need something stronger so I bought Aveeno SPF30. Because I never have any trouble with Clinique burning my eyes, I did not hesitate to rub the moisturizer all over my face including my eyes. I have had lotions that burned before but nothing like this!!! I washed my eyes to no avail. It burned for hours!!! The very least Aveeno could do is to put some kind of warning not to use on the eye area - but there is NOTHING!! I will never buy Aveeno anything ever again!!"
2,Probably a good product but stains clothing!,"When the Dermatologist recommended Aveeno Active Naturals Moisturizer with SPF-30 (and sister product Aveeno SPF-15) for my husband who had many skin cancers, he used it daily and liked the non-greasy feel it left on his face and neck, arms, etc. However, it didn't take long before I noticed unsightly, orange stains on necklines, and collars of his tee shirts and light colored polo's (or anywhere else the fabric touched the treated skin areas.) I've soaked them, used every detergent on the market, and even tried remedies from ""Haley's Hints"". Nothing works, they won't come out!!Considering the cost of replacing the clothing, this is one expensive product."
5,"Tender, very inspiring music.","I was very surprised to find I was the first one to review this album until I listened to the amazon samples.They are too short, these songs need to be listened complete. The music is great especially the first tracks.Every time I listen to this record I found it very profound, smooth and full of hope, just like our lives are or should be."
5,Fisher Price High Chair,This high chair is great! It is easy to fold and easy to adjust. It wipes clean with no fuss. Little ones are very comfortable in it. I highly recommend it.
4,good cd- rediculous price,"This is a really awesome cd, but i just have to say, i just (Dec 3, 2006) ordered it at my local record shop for $8.99. I'm not joking. these guys are nuts asking $70.00 for it here!!! hope this helps."
1,Didn't work then - Doesn't work now,"This book is sort of the stereotypical ""How to hide your money offshore"" sort of book, which totally ignores the realities of how people, banks and trust companies must respond to subpoenas, and how they must report offshore activity to the IRS or else face perjury charges for filing false returns. Indeed, some of the strategies advocated by this book have since proven not to work, such as those involving offshore credit cards (the IRS simply issued subpoenas to the major credit card companies for their records and now the people who held such credit cards are facing criminal investigations and possibly significant jail time).In other words, it is unintentionally a guide as to what not to do. Pass on this one."
1,please try to keep to the facts !,"While the reviews of Rouco and ""James"" are no reviews at all, the other two prove to me without doubt that the book must be a complete nonsense and a waste of time. Western superiority is derived not from guns and cannons, but from science and math and technology and a modernized government that made superior ships and weapons possible. To claim that the rise of the western world was made possible by gold and silver from what was to become Latin America is nonsense. Europe would have become superiour even without the Americas by its modern science and technology and government. For a proof of this read what I wrote on the book of Blaut on ""Eight Eurocentric Historians"" (http://www.amazon.com/Eight-Eurocentric-Historians-J-M-Blaut/dp/1572305916/ref=cm_cr-mr-title). That there are only praising votes here is explained from the fact that no serious scientist would bother to comment such a silly book."
3,Cow Parade New York Misses a Few,"I like this book, but am disappointed that it left out some of the cows that I saw around New York! I can't believe it put SEVERAL 'taxi' themed cows and a couple of 'zebra' themed cows in and left out one of the most creative cows--the 'Grand Piano Cow' (at 3rd and 49th). I hope there is another book that is complete! I saw the cows in Chicago, Salzburg (Austria), the Pigs in Cincinnati and the Horses in Lexington, Kentucky. I hope they all eventually publish books as it would make a neat collection."
4,Wonderful artwork.,"This book is really nice. For those who managed to see the cow parade in NY it is a must keepsake for memories. It is a shame that many of the cows did not seem to make it to the book though, as some of your favourites might be missing. For those who did not see the parade its still a great book, shows imagination of the artists. However I think the people who picked the cows from the initial proposals could have been done without some of the duplication. I found the book lacking in explanation of how the cows got there, why, and where they all went so quickly. Such information would have been more useful that how dairy herds started in NY state! Further investigation uncovered that the cows went on auction for charity (would have been nice to know that). It also revealed that this is not the same company that did the Zurich parade, those guys are rather cross and suing the company who did the NY one for stealing their ideas and cow models!"
4,Is it bad to write about Sex?,"Well, yes and no! First of all sex is something that most people will partake in during their lifetime from the ages of 16-65, some people are raped and abused and start very young while others continue their sex lives throughout their lives until they die. Sex is a male obsession, presumably because men have external sex organs that are stimulated by culturally determined signals and customs of behavior, action and dress. The novel is not too drastic in it's expression of physical love. It is subdued though it says the word nipple and talks about sex it is not detailed enough to be completely offensive. Books that skirt the real issued involved in realistic love are not a good perspective on romance and paint a skewed picture of life that alters the readers' ideas about how love or romance is supposed to be."
3,Err Um.. It was different,"Ok, let me start by saying the book was different from anything else i'd ever read. I didn't quite understand it as far as the pleasure these characters received from pain. It was weird to me. Some parts were erotic to me but mostly i just kept reading for the story to see what was going to happen next, to beauty, as far as the places she was going to go and i guess hoping she would be able to escape these people hurting her and live happily ever after. Well there was a twist on the whole happily ever after theme. I think i probably didn't get too much into it cause i'm not really into the whole S&M scene. But if that's your kinda bag baby then i'm sure you will LOVE this book."
3,"Ok, but unimaginitive.","If you read the first book, you have pretty much read all three. Unfortunately, I went out and bought the box set. I read the first book, and it was ok... not very imaginitive or erotic if you ask me, but the goal was for the author to write down her own fantasies, not mine. When I finished the first book and moved on to the second... I thought I was reading a carbon copy of the first. The only real difference in the books is the location where they take place. The third book is different than the other two, and to me the best and most erotic of the three, but again... It wasn't as imaginitive or thrilling as I had hoped."
5,Captivating,"I began reading these books and had them done in less than a week. What an amazing twist on the fairy tale. I couldn't put them down. Anne Rice draws you in to the story in a way that I have never been before. She shows the true beauty in the art of submission. I am a active submissive and would recommend these books to anyone interested in the S&M world. Anne Rice has written the emotion, fear, love, and devotion so well. She is now on the top of my favorite author's list."
1,Unmitigated Garbage,"I want my money back. Boring, not at all erotic, just plain disgusting picture of human debasement. Doesn't even rise to the level of pornography."
1,How Degrading!,"Don't be conceived that these books are anything like 50 Shades. This story is all about sexual slavery, torture and beating down a human being's spirit. I read a few chapters of the fist book and threw them in the trash...SICK, SICK, SICK!"
3,"Anne Rice ""Sleeping Beauty""","What I was hoping out of this book was not received. I understand it was not the Disney love story but I was hoping for some line of something like that, and I did not get it. It appears the ending shoved that in, and could have been better. Readers need to be ready for some disturbing material to read, with little to no gratifaction for yourself. Even though I did end up reading all 3 books, overall I was a bit let down."
2,not what i anticipated,"whoever claimed this was 50 shades worthy was wrong, in my opinion. 50 shades was erotic, this is more like, i don't even have a word. i have enjoyed ann rices books in the past. i'll just keep reading her drama/murder mysteries. this was such a let down and waste of hard earned money."
3,Not anything like 50,"These books are ok. At first it is like are you kidding me..... And I haven't finished the trilogy yet, but it is not anything like 50 shades of grey like it says, but I guess the story line is kind of interesting. I bought the trilogy because it was slightly cheaper to do so, and I knew I wouldn't read just one, but I think if I had bought just the first one I would have stopped at the first book."
2,Not so good,"This novel starts off strong, but turns out to be very strange. The sex is mostly just paddling and not very libido boosting. I find the story line to be repetetive and I have not connection to any of the characters because they were not built well. I could care less how their lives carry on. The premise is interesting because it is unique and nothing more."
2,w.o.w..,"someone had me borrow these..i had no idea what i was getting into and started reading the first one at work..the whole time reading these books, i felt molested..but i have a friend who borrowed them and absolutely LOVED them. she isn't much of a reader and she went through them pretty fast..so i got them for her for her birthday..they are..special..just know what you're getting yourself into when you read them. don't just trust a friends recommendation!!"
4,For the open minded...,"This series is very strong and full of explicit descriptions. It is a good series, but it gets a bit repetitive. I think it could have been written in one book, not three."
3,Unexpected,"Having never read anything like this before, I was intrigued. It was very well written, the series flows well. The transformation of Beauty throughout the 3 books as she comes to understand and appreciate submission is tantalizing. I think I could have done without a lot of the male oriented sequences in the book, however. Some of it was a bit over the top for me. On the whole, it was highly erotic and imaginative."
3,Less is More,"Being an avid Ann Rice fan (and interested in tasteful erotica, if there is such a thing), I was eager to read these when lent them by a friend. I found them quite 'hot' in places, but an unrelieved diet of any kind of sex, however creative or kinky, quickly turns rather silly, wildly funny, and then simply boring (when you get the giggles, you know the party's over). The trilogy would have been a real page-turner (not to mention a re-read) if it had been condensed into one volume. However, hats off to Ann Rice anyway: her ""straight"" novels are more erotic than ""Beauty"" anyway."
5,a whole new world,"Elegantly written erotica. I read this trilogy at the tender age of 16 and it has influenced my concept of sex inalterably. I recommend this to any person seeking spicier ideas, or just wondering what else is out there. With Beauty we are allowed to explore the many aspects of our selves we may never have otherwise considered."
5,AMAZING!!!,I could not put any of these down. From the moment I started reading them I was hooked! I hope she writes more like them.
4,very hot,"well written. I haven't read 30 shades of grey, but I've hear it's written much better. Anne Rice is great."
5,The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy,The books arrived before they were supposed to be there. They had arrived a week before they were due to arrive. The quality of the books was great. I expected paperback and got hardback.
2,Boring,I was disappointed with this trilogy. I found it to be boring. Too much of the same thing happening over and over. I ended up skimming over much of it.
1,Anus obsessed!,I kept thinking this story would get better! It doesn't! Save your time and read something with characters that you can enjoy....this story is consumed with the anys and ansl sex and us a chapter skipper! Disgusting!
1,Horrible,I will always finish a book or serious when I start them. This trilogy was the hardest set of books to get through. It is very disturbing and I am not sure what kind of a person can even think like this. It's NOTHING like 50 shades of Grey.....I would never recommend any one read these books. At some parts I was so grossed out my stomach actually got so upset I didn't think I could finish the trilogy. Not a good read at all.
1,Awful books,"These are the worst books I have ever read, I have only read half of the first book and I do not intend to finish reading them."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is not good. Unless you like to read about losing your personal freedom, save your money. The world doesn't need to read about beatings and torture and public humiliation. There's enough of that in the real world. Even the author's skillful prose can't save these. Read her other books, but these are not a turn on."
3,Straight up porn.,"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan. That being said, these books are basically just hardcore erotica. If that's what you're looking for then great. If you're not into gay sex and extreme humiliation/bondage scenarios, these are definitely not for you."
4,"Graphic, but Great","I thought these books were great! I had gotten these books as a present and read them all in less than three days. The sex scenes are extremely graphic, but you find yourself drawn into Beauty's world. You go from the palace, to the village, to a sultan's palace, back to the village, and finally back to Beauty's home. It's hard to put these books down because in spite of how you may feel about the sexuaul material, you want to find out what happens to Beauty, Tristan, and all the others. I would recommend these books to all my friends. I can't wait to get started on my next Anne Rice novel."
2,"Story is great, print quality sucks","The story is great and a damn good read, but I only score the item itself so poorly because the print quality of the books and their cardboard box is quite terrible. It's almost like they're all made of poor recycled paper or something. Very cheap. If you want the books but you like nice things, hunt around for a different edition printed by someone else so you'll enjoy it more, since the actual story and the writing themselves are wonderful."
5,I don't want to be royalty,"When I read 50 Shades, I tried to get in the mind of Mr Gray, to see where his head was, what caused him to be Christian Gray. Upon reading Sleeping Beauty, there are two things I'm sure of. 1. Disney is doing flips. LOL and 2. I do not want to be royalty.The stars aligned just right for Ms Rice to re-introduce her book. I am sure, at least twenty people I know are reading this trilogy."
3,"I bit shocking to read. I did after reading it, pass it on to other people to read.",This book was a bit over the top. I did however share it with others to read and enjoy as well.
2,Agree with YAWN2,"I generally like Anne Rice's books, but with these, she seems to have beaten one general (and simple) theme to death. After the first book she doesn't exhibit much originality at all, but just rehashes the same material over ad infinitum. I would liked to have seen more variations on a theme. The titilation factor was lacking except in select rather brief segments."
1,Absolutely hated it,"I consider myself open-minded and progressive, so for me to say that I hated this says something. Tasteless, boring, redundant, pointless, ridiculous. Shall I go on? I made it through the first book, and have not and will not read the other two."
1,"""YAWN 2""","I agree with ""YAWN's"" review. I'm an Anne Rice fan and cannot wait for her next book to publish. But these threw me for a loop. After the first book, and maybe first few chapters, it was the same old stuff. I guess I'm not cut out for the theme of these books."
1,Not Even Comparable to 50 Shades of Gray,"This triolgy was billed as one that 50 Shades fans would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I enjoyed 50 Shades, not for the writing style or the edgy sexual content, but for the excellent character development and compelling love story. The Sleeping Beauty Triliogy is not even comparable.In 50 Shades, the sexual activity was consentual. Not so in Anne Rice's books where young princes and princesses are forced into sexual servitude and exposed on nearly every page to punishment, degradation and humiliation. Those forced to serve are made to crawl naked on all fours through the castle, eat food from plates on the floor like dogs and serve many masters.The books, in my opinion, are repulsive and a total waste of money. If you enjoyed 50 Shades, try a Sylvia Day book next - the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy likely won't be for you."
1,sleeping beauty trilogy,I've been a life long fan of Anne Rice's works. But this was without a doubt the worse tripe she has ever written. I wouldn't recommend this trilogy to my worst enemy.P and a U!!!!
1,Gag!,"WARNING!!! This trilogy contains false advertising. I really wish I had checked out the readers reviews before buying this filth. About a fourth of the way into the first book, I stopped and looked up the word erotic in the dictionary. I was right - the contents of this trilogy do not contain anything erotic. And no, sadism is not erotic. If I could, I would give these books minus stars. A lot of them."
1,Cruelty Is Not Erotic,"I bought these knowing that there would be explicit descriptions of sex, single and multiple partner, gay and straight. I am no prude. I had not read the vampire chronicles. However, I was horrified when the book started with Sleeping Beauty being RAPED awake. I flipped through the rest of the book and found scene after scene of this girl being abused and humiliated. Didn't even bother with the two remaining volumes. Even among S & M couples, there is usually some degree of caring. This stuff is just plain sick and very dangerous in its portrayal of violence towards women. Ms. Rice, get help!"
1,Waste of money & time,"The best thing about this series of novels are the covers: luscious reclining semi-nudes with lovely breasts. I never got further than halfway through part one: The Claiming of the Sleeping Beauty, which should have been titled: The Whimpering of the Sleeping Beauty. Endless accounts of spanking, raping, torture, whimpering, crying and what have you. No character development, no psychological insights or even intriques. Extremely repetitive. Oh and another annoying thing, the walking on hands and knees, what's up with that? I guess I am (maybe) more into Bondage LIght and the Beauty books are way too heavy handed for me.I am sorry I waste my money. Buyers beware. Read the all the reviews before you order the books.The Sleeping Beauty Novels: The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty / Beauty's Release / Beauty's Punishment"
1,Sleeping beauty,"I thought this book would be a fairtayle like romance with more adult material, what i thought would be a story about love and courage was nothing more then sex and tourture. I wasn't able to finish the other books due to the graphic homosexually nature. I felt sorry for the young boys and just felt sick about the stories. I was really disapointed and the book was written poorly as well. Mark my words read the reviews and ratings before you buy this book. I guess i'll try to sell my copy to someone."
2,very disappointed in the vendor,I bought this movie expecting a 3 book series and paid a high price. When I received only 1 book in the series I was very disappointed. Thats what you get sometimes from a lemon vendor.
2,Sleeping Beauty Trilogy,"I wanted to order this series on my Kindle but was a bit irritated when I saw the price...$38 for the Kindle edition!!! I checked the paperback and it's $10 less...how is that??? I find it really annoying that a book that is electronically sent to me, hasn't used any paper and no postage costs more then the real book. I'm still going to order it but I think the Kindle price is ridiculous!"
3,Sleeping Beauty,"To me beauty was a slut! She would jump anybody! At first I felt sorry for her, but later on in the story a lot happens and then it's like she can't help herself!"
1,Sleeping Beauty put me to sleep,"The triology was boring and a waste of money. Sleeping Beauty disappeared, for the most part, in books two and three. Also, books 2 and 3 rambled with no real landing or connection with any of the characters. Too many side stories.While I am all for fantasy and like the erotic, this was so far over the rainbow I found myself shaking my head thinking ""you've got to be kidding.""I deleted this set from my Kindle AND from the archives!"
1,awful,To me this was over the top vulgar. Anne Rice has a very specific audience. It was over the top for me. I had to put it down....it was horrible.
3,Darker than expected,I purchased this series when it was compared to the 50 Shades of Grey series. Please be aware that this is much darker than the 50 Shades books. I would rate the content as an R compared to the PG rating of 50 Shades.
3,Not sure,Ok not really what I thought it would be but I love Ann Rice so you have to kind of read all three to get into it. Not fifty shades of grey but good
3,Intersting,"I was very hopeful of this series with the author and her books. Interesting and Good. But not a great Read. Hard to get into and keep my interest. Sorry, normally I am so excited after reading a series but this set is not a the top of my list."
2,A bit over done,I was told to read these books after I finished 50 shades of grey. They don't compare. 50 is a love story with adult content. These are just gross and sad.
