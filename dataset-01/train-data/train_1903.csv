2,Disappointing,I had read all the reviews before ordering it and should have listened to the one reviewer who did not like the narration. The voices used to narrate the conversation part are annoying; not natural in my opinion. There must be a better choice than this one.
1,unhappy,"I am not happy with the way my order was handled, I was to have free shipping and when i confirmed my order over $17.00 was added for shipping. I do not ever plan on ordering anything from you again. I feel i was ripped off.."
1,Don't try NR041 with XP,"4 Port Cable/DSL Network Anywhere router works fine with Motorola SurfBoard and Linksys cable modems with Windows 9x, and Windows 2000. Absolutely with NOT work with Windows XP."
1,4 port router,I bought this two years ago...then it went dead...contacted linksys and they said it the life of this router is only around 2 years anyway...so if you want to buy a router and not have to replace it then find something else...dont waste your time
2,DLink has better tech support,"I was in the market for a cheap router solution. The two I picked were the this router and the DLink DI-604. I had trouble setting up w/ both routers, but in the end, I kept the DLink b/c they have support 24/7, where as the Linksys support is only 8-5 PST M-F. Of course, I was setting up the network on the weekend/at night, so DLink was easily the winner here. The Linksys router is less, but in my mind the 24/7 support is worth the extra money.I agree w/ the review from ""An electronics fan from Honolulu, HI USA"", who said that no cat-5 cable was included. Shima-tech-services claim that the router comes w/ all the cables. Who do you believe?"
1,Network Everywhere 4-Port Cable/DSL Router,Have had difficulty with getting the unit to work. Installed software with no positive result.
4,DEAD at age 22 days,"I had originally written a review praising this router. It worked right out of the box, easy set-up. But, 22 days after purchase, it started shutting itself off. Would run fine--for approx. 3 minutes, then ""lights out"" literally. Would have to unplug its powerblock, wait a minute or so, then replug. Still, just the 3 minutes and off again. Took it back to CompUSA (which was ""nice"" enough to let me exchange it past their 14-day limit, as long as I paid another $4.99 for their 1-year ""walk-in replacement"" warranty), swapped it out for another of the exact same model. That 2nd one went belly-up the next day; same deal, but the off time varied from the earlier one's 3 minutes. Tried plugging it into another outlet (not my power strip, thinking it might possibly be that); no change. Returned it to CompUSA the next day, exchanged it for their store brand router. That's only been 3 days, but so far, it's still running. We'll see.For me, NO MORE LINKSYS *ANYTHING*."
3,Good Value Router,"The router itself is very good... But it also runs at a high temperature and is extremely hot to the touch... And the rebate... well, you won't get it, because I tried but the company said that I didn't buy it within the rebate promotional period... I sent them a copy of the receipt and rebate form again, but I still was denied the money... I guess the rebate people are illiterate."
3,"Its ok, good value","it sometimes looses the internet connection, and its a hassle to set up a working ftp/server. besides that i think its a good solution for a home network, or a small bussiness network. its a good value though, buy it and try it!"
1,Piece of junk,"I could never get this box to work. I plugged in my Ethernet connections in the exact same way I did with my old switch/box (I assure you it's not that I don't know how to use these types of things, I used a newer box that was only a few years old prior to this). Even when I used the CD that came with it, it tells me I'm not connected to the internet! True, I guess I can't complain about this $5 piece of hardware from 2002/3.. but still, waste of that little bit of money. Do not buy."
1,Just didn't work,"May have been defective. 1) It would only recognize one of three PC's on the network, regardless of which port they were plugged into. (Apparently it couldn't handle CAT5 cable lengths greater than 6 feet.) 2) The HTML-based interface was buggy, I really wasn't expecting to see script errors from firmware. 3) It runs awfully hot. I returned it the next day, and exchanged it for a ""real"" LinkSys, which so far is working out great."
2,Baseball Cap Purchase,"I was not happy with this product.A year ago I bought this same brand of baseball cap, but with the Texas Rangers logo. This year I bought one with the Boston Red Sox Logo. This year's was of decidedly inferior quality. The crown was lower and was not as well shaped. It looks like they skimped in the amount of material used to make the cap. I won't buy this brand again."
2,baseball cap,adjustable cap adjusted to largest fit was still too small for my XL head. wish I had known maximum adjustable width prior to buying it.
5,the MOST helpful book for those desiring natural birth,"This book was by far the BEST book and approach to having an aware, powerful, confident birth experience. It didn't try to teach me tricks (mostly useless) to avoid the contractions and pain, but instead taught WHY we have contractions, that they are HEALTHY and GOOD, and how to work with them. Embrace them! Your are bringing forth new life. What an opportunity to participate in a miracle. Don't miss it! Read this book!"
5,Round Head Framing Nailer,"I bought this same reconditioned Porter Cable Round Head Framing Nailer through Amazon about a year ago. It has performed excellently and upholds the Porter Cable standard of excellence. The only fault that I have found with this nailer is that the rubber tip is easily lost or torn. Since I have had such a positive experience with the previous purchase, I am buying another for a gift."
5,From finish to fence,"I purchased this nailer to use primarily in building and repairing three board fence. For this it does an excellent job in the field. It is also precise enough to use in more delicate jobs. I used it to build three benches from salvaged 1"" barn floors. It worked like a high-powered finish nailer. Overall a solid tool that has paid for itself with time savings."
4,"Great Nail Gun, second time around","The first nailer I recieved didn't work properly, the driver wouldn't retract. I followed the instructions for oil, and used the proper nails but no luck. Amazon's return policy worked flawlessly. They sent me a replacement via FedEx 2nd day and I received a perfectly working nailer that looks as if it has never been used. The price was excellent and I was able to build 85 feet of fencing without a single problem. I think, based on previous reviews that receiving a gun that didn't work was certainly an exception and Amazon did an awesome job of correcting it."
1,Would have put 0 stars but review will not accept,"My name is Richard Davis. I am an original member of the Memphis Mafia. Apparently, Frank Coffey, has not researched the subject of Elvis Presley for this book. This book is full of falsehoods and a plethora of errors and every true Elvis fan will see through the book's inaccuracies from wrong dates to out and out lies. I am an authority on Elvis because I am an original member of the Memphis Mafia and have been since 1961. I am one of the only members who actually lived with Elvis at Graceland. I was his movie stand-in, one of his bodyguards, wardrobe manager and part of his ""inner circle"" of friends. If you enjoy reading fiction this book is for you!"
1,Disappointed New Mom,"This did not work for my little guy. I tried it when he was older in music mode, even that was disappointing. It sounded like a bad piano recital. I had such high hopes for this and was very let down."
3,It's OK,"I bought this bear for my 5 week old daughter to calm her when she is feeling fussy and the usual tehcniques don't work.I was really excited to get this because she is very calmed by noises from the hairdryer or a vaccum, but it wasn't quite the miracle worker I had hoped for. I found that this bear wasn't loud enough at times for her to hear it over her crying!It think it did help her sleep a little bit longer though--if she was already calm and was drifting off to sleep I could put it in her crib and it seemed to lull her into a deeper sleep--with less startles/awakenings. It's not bad--but typically the hair dryer works better at calming her down initially--once she is calm--then this bear can take over. Also--have an eyeglass repair kit and an extra set of batteries on hand. The batteries don't last too long."
3,Nancy in New york,"I bought this for my two week old who was very, very fussy and I did not get the results I had hoped for. It did not put him to sleep, the batteries did not last that long. What I did find was that when he was almost to sleep it worked to help keep him a sleep or in the car(baby bear) worked great for the car ride and when out and about he loved the music not the heartbeat. His cheap little alarm clock that plays nature sounds works a lot better."
1,Disappointing,"I really like Mannheim Steamroller, but some of the tracks on this album are somewhat strange and dark sounding. I expect Christmas music to be light and cheerfull, this is not, at least some of the music. I stopped the CD because I felt it was ""scarry""."
3,Story Not Inspiring,"As much as I enjoy Mannheim Music, I was a bit disappointed in this CD. Not because of the music, but instead of them trying to tell a story with it. I think it is great that Chip Davis tries new things, but I just don't think this worked. Jump past the Olivia Newton John and Skip's story line and go to the music. The music is as beautiful as always."
1,re-hash of previous recordings,"if you have previous Mannheim recordings, don't bother with this one.--just a remix of previous work. the narration is not an worthy enhancement"
1,One trick pony,"I was very disappointed with The Christmas Angel. Expecting something new, and having loved MS's earlier titles, I was really let down. The Christmas Angel is nothing more than Olivia Newton John and Chip Davis reciting a silly New Age story over previously released recordings. If you already have the original stuff, save your money. If you don't, my advice is to buy the original stuff, and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Scary and spooky,"This CD is more suited for Halloween than Christmas. Some of the music is interesting, but overall, the whole effect is just weird."
3,"Music good, Story uninspiring and unnecessary","I received this as a Christmas gift from someone who really likes Mannheim Steamroller. They listened and didn't like the talking. I wasn't that familiar with them although I had heard Deck The Halls before. I found the CD very easy to listen to. I like the music. I wouldn't buy this for the ""Family Story"". I agree with other reviewers that the ""poetry"" is terrible, the story itself would be better if it was just told without trying to rhyme. From a Christian standpoint, I did't like the story. Although there is an Angel, the story has NOTHING to do with CHRISTmas. It may represent the unseen battles as stated in Eph.6:12. Aside from that, I enjoyed listening to the music and the talking didn't bother me, it was actually soothing to hear the voice even when I wasn't actually listening to the story. My guess is, if you like the group and only want to hear their music, this isn't the CD to buy. Otherwise its okay."
1,"Shame on you, Chip Davis!","To put out a heap of previously-released material under the guise of a ""family story"" is LOW. Try that again and I'll accuse you of loving disco! And for those of you who gave this stellar reviews, you obviously hadn't bought any of their earlier Christmas albums. They were the real thing, while this was a ""greatest hits"" without admitting it."
1,"Bah humbug on ""The Christmas Angel""","Having (regretably) just purchased the new Mannheim Stamroller Christmas CD ""The Christmas Angel, A Family Story"", I am a little bit miffed about it. This CD is SHOVELWARE! If you already have the other Mannheim CDs, then save your money. There's nothing new here. Maybe I should chunk the CD and liner materials in the trash and use the jewel case for something else."
1,Buy the first three 'roller Christmas CD's and stop.,"I am so sorry that I bought ""The Christmas Angel"" CD. The first three 'roller Christmas CD's were absolute jewels. I could even tolerate the ""live"" one. I never dreamed that Chip Davis and Company would trick us with a cheap rehash, pointless and intrusive narrative, and electronic flapdoodling for song bridging. I usually chalk a bad Christmas CD purchase up to experience. I'm actually a bit ticked at this one. Shame on you! I'd feel much better if the profits were going to a good charitable cause..."
1,nothing more than a sampler of old stuff with some sap added,"This is taking advantage of fan loyalty! First, a LIVE recording rehash. Now, some sappy prose linked to some music done ten years ago. You lost me on this weak effort to capitalize on your name."
1,"Looks nice, but doesn't work","After a few weeks of using this watch, it was ten minutes slow. I reset the time, however, it still doesn't keep the right time."
2,too expensive,"The size is right, but the price is far from right. I would suggestyou turn to Logitech for a better and cheaper solution unless youstress the integration of the system beyond functionality."
2,Don't buy unless your kids are tall for thier age,"I bought these clubs for my 4 year old who is about 40 inches tall. I opened the box before wrapping it for Xmas and looked at the clubs and realized they were way to big for him. They would be great for my 7 year old, but not my four year old. I had to returnt them (which was easy), but I had to run out to Dick;s Sporting Goods and get a MaxFli Rev 1 set that had the correct height as it was listed on the box."
3,"Geat clubs, BAD BAG!!!!","My son bought these clubs with his savings($120.00). The clubs seem really nice, as did the bag. Well he has played 5 rounds of golf on his junior league and the bag has all but fallen apart. The straps and zippers have broken. I recycled the box so I have no way of getting a hold of the company to see if the can replace the bag. I'm hoping this was just a bad bag and that no one else will have this problem. If anyone know were to get a hold of the company please let me know."
3,WRONG SIZE AND INCOMPLETE ORDER,I ordered size 3 - 7 and received size 4 - 7. The description includes golf balls and tees which were not included. I was told there really is no size 3 - 7. The person who handled the call was very hard to understand. He sent out a complete replacement set with a return label for the incomplete set. I am disappointed that they were not smaller however the quality looks good.
5,A boombox worth the money,"Finally a boombox that can be used with either Sirius or XM satellite radio! What took so long? Plus it has AM-FM, CD player,an ipod plug-in jack and a headphone jack. All for a tad over $100.00. Better yet, it's a Sony! Works great and sounds great. I wish it was a bit smaller. Had a heck of a time finding a tote bag big enough to carry it to work. I recommend this highly. Why spend more than a hundred bucks on a boombox designed for a specific satellite unit/system only with no AM-FM or CD player? Did I mention it has a remote? Another added plus!"
1,YUK,"Radio seems to work but remote went dead after one click. Try and find this remote on Sony site - you won't, which kinda makes it hard to get support. My second Sony satellite radio purchase and, after two bad experiences, my last."
3,A good start but there is more to be done,"Advice to preachers on not perpetuating anti-Judaism is long overdue, though this book does not cover all the ground. It only relates to the gospels yet the other New Testament readings sometimes get preached upon and they can be problematic, especially Galatians."
2,Didn't last long enough for me.,"This laptop performed adequately for 2 1/2 years. Then the screen died. Acer wanted $200 to fix/replace it, so I bought an external monitor instead. I used it for a few weeks and now the computer has completely crashed. Since purchasing it I have found that Acer has a poor record for reliability over time. My experience certainly corroborates that."
2,Ouch! That fall still hurts!,"I expect the padding to be of much better quality for the price. It's too soft and doesn't cushion fall well. Even when I kneel/sit on it, my knees/bums still feel like they're on hard floor without any cushioining, and my baby still screams whenever she accidentally falls on it (even a ""gentle"" fall like falling from standing to a sitting position). A much cheaper foam mat would give your child better cushioning against a fall, not to mention that a foam mat is not ""spongy"" and pillowy like this, definitely better for babies who are learning to crawl and walk. The only good thing is that it's easy to clean and durable enough to be put outdoor. But the benefit, to me, is nowhere near its price tag."
4,Simple to use,"I like this product, however it runs out of ink quickly and hard to find the right type of paper."
1,worst photo printer I've seen+,"We purchased these printers for our program at a children's hospital in which we create photos for families. The photos take forever to print because they have to go through 3 layers of color. The ink runs out quickly and is hard to find. The photos print with little splotches of color all over. The screen does not move so it is hard to see what you are doing. Twice when I was printing, the ink film stuck to the photo and cam unraveled and we had to throw away the entire ink cartridge. The HP photo printers are much easier to use and longer lasting with better photo quality."
1,Reduces Emily's poetry to the level of cheap pulp fiction.,"Emily Dickinson wrote POEMS, not autobiography, not history, but POEMS. She is a great American, now globally triumphant, and her writings deserve to be treated with far greater sensitivity, intelligence, and respect than is shown in this book, a book that reduces them to the level of cheap pulp fiction. So please don't waste your money. Buy her poems in a good edition such as those of R. W. Franklin or Thomas H. Johnson and read them. And if you would like to read about her life, read the excellent biography by R. B. Sewall, a scholar who gets his facts straight and who does not indulge in idle, foolish, and sensational speculation. But whatever you do, stay away from the present book. Emily Dickinson has much more to offer the world than the cheap thrill of an imagined romance."
2,"Sorry, Snoop","I Love Snoop. I have all of his albums. But Dead Man Walking(under Death Row) just didn't do it for me. The beats are unoriginal and bland but his rhymes are still fresh. There are a few good songs, most notably #6 Change Gone Come and #8 Gangsta Walk, but the rest were pretty bad. If you're a die hard Snoop fan like I am you might want to check this out, but if you're not, forget about it. This is a far cry from Doggystyle."
2,Dead Man Rappin,"Snoop has so much talent and has made some great music, but he is definitely on the decline. I know this is just kind of a thrown together album with some unreleased tracks, but Snoop should have put a stop to this CD coming out. It is so generic; it sounds just like all of his recent music. It is filled with the same weak funky old-school beats that he has used before. He just wants to put out something that sounds like every other hip-hop album coming out now. I hope he will make a comeback with the Last Meal album that is coming out soon, but I am not optomistic. If you are a fan of Snoop, stay away. It will depress you that Snoop just goes through the motions here. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you can't help but love his laid-back rapping style."
5,Everything old is new again,"This is a great CD. If you're a fan of Doggystyle, or any of Snoop's earlier stuff, you will love this. County Blues is amazing, it has the feeling of a blues song with an edge. Also, his voice is pure liquid on Change Gone Come... while I am interested as to what he himself thinks of this record being released by Death Row, it's amazing stuff. Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
1,don't buy this,"First things first, I like Snoop Dogg, but this album is just weak. I don't even know why Death Row released it other than to make a bad name for Snoop. As if Tha Doggfather album wasn't bad enough they used the songs that weren't good enough to make it onto that CD. Fianl words: if you are buying this to complete your unopened Snoop CD collection then buy it it, but if you actually want a good CD to listen to then look elswhere."
3,Snoop Doggy Dogg... Dead Man Walking..,"When I first got this CD, I was expecting Death Row to put some songs that Doggy Dogg recorded, and weren't quite that good. But I was surprised, I really like this CD. I think I liked the ""Death Row Snoop Doggy Dogg At His Best"" better, but they didn't release that for some strange reason. Most of the beats on this CD are pretty good, the lyrics on most songs are great, some could be better. It features appearances by Raphael Saadiq, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, Swoop G and others. My favorite songs are ""May I"", ""Tommy Boy"", ""Head Doctor"", and ""Too Black"". All great song in my opinion. If you a fan of Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound, or Dre, I suggest you pick this up. This is not his best, but it is good, good enough to get and listen to."
3,"Good Music, Funky, Death-Row Era Tracks--","Not bad at all-- crisp sound, professional production, only a few guest stars-- Snoop sounds good-- recommended, depending on how you feel about his defection from Death Row--"
5,"Snoop's second best album, give it a chance.","4 1/2 StarsThis personally is my second favorite Snoop album (behind Doggystyle, of course). The reason I love this album is because it's straight up gangsta-rap, the stuff Snoop and The Row used to make before the untimely deaths of the two Coastal Kings. This album was made before any rapper really thought of the consequences of living a truly gangster life. This album is actually rawer than Doggystyle, though it lacks a little of the Dre flair. If you like Doggystyle, I suggest giving this a chance. This album was released without consent of Snoop. Snoop probably doesn't want this album out but that's a shame because it is undoubtedly his second best CD and one of my top albums of all time. Also, another plus is that it is ridiculously cheap in the 'New and Used' section. This CD cost me 83 cents. That makes this album even sweeter."
1,Truth,If You Are A Wise Person Heed This Warning! Don't Waste Your Money On This! This Album Is Not Presentable And Is Not SuitableFor Buying! This Album Is An Abomination To And Great Artist! Forget This Album Was Made! Old Outdated Forget It! Doesn't Sound Right! Be Smart And Take My Word On It. Deserves No Stars!
5,Great book for young learners,I am a teacher and my students in first grade enjoyed this book. It enhances their interest in the solar system and provides easy-to-understand information about the closest star to our Earth. Illustrations are simple and aid in explaining science concepts to children. A great book for young learners.
1,Go-Nets Lack of Worth,"I recently purchase a Go-Net Adapter for my online gaming on the PS2 console. It works with older online games such as OFFROAD FURY 2, but will not work with newer games like SOCOM 2, My Street, Midnight Club2, and any other of the new online games. I am now an owner of the SONY adapter, and highly reccomend spending the extra 15-20 bucks, and saving your time. So, to make it simple, DONT BUY GO-NET, Save and BUY SONY!!!"
1,go-net is really really bad. do not purchase,"i got go-net for christmas and i went into configuration and an error kept showing up that i had no connection when clearly everything was plugged in. so i tried it several times and still nothing. but also my headset doesnt work with my socom. that is also an off brand item from ""Talk-net"". im not sure if its my usb ports but do ur self a huge favor BUY ALL SONY PRODUCTS FOR ONLINE GAMING. u'll save ur self time and money"
1,Run AWAY!!!,All of these other reviews r right. I wish I had read them before I bought this stupid thing. now I'm stuck with it. I wanted to play Monster Hunter online but with this crappy thing u can't.
4,BECAREFUL CRAPPY PRODUCT,I HAD THIS CRAP AND WISH I NEVER BOUGHT IT I TRIED TO PLAY MANY NEW ONLINE GAMES AND FOUND OUT THAT IT DID NOT WORK WITH ANYTHING I PLAN TO TAKE IT BACK AND GET MY MONEY I HOPE THAT NO ONE ELSE PURCHASES THIS GARBAGE I TRIED THE COMPANY AND THEY SAY IT'S ONLY FOR OLD GAMES THAT SUPPORT THE USB CONNECTION. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD PUT THOSE DAMN WORDS ON THE #@$@@#$ BOX HOWS ABOUT THAT GREG #$#% YOU. IF I DIDN'T LIVE MILES AWAY I WOULD SHOVE THIS UP YOUR *&^.P.S. NO ONE DARE BUY THIS OR YOUR GOING TO GO TO HELL
1,This SUCKS overtime,"ok, I got this for christmas and i was sooo excited. I could'nt wait to take it home.I hooked it all up, I used Ratchet:deadlocked(great game love it =))And i did everything it said and it would not work. It didnt work for ANY of my online games. So if i were you, i would not buy this product or return it A.S.A.P. 1 other thing, it comes with a DVD and all i learned from it is you need an RJ45 cable. They did not tell you how to get on standard games. They had Socom:Navy seals AND NFL 2K3 or whatever, and its like 3 years old! Seriously,everybody, DO NOT BUY THIS. IT SUCKS AND IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE SONY 1 IT IS A BETTER DEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!,"Like the other people who have posted here I found that this product does not work. We have 3 different online games for the PS2, none of them worked even though this company claims their product is ""100% compatible"". It is not, stay away, and I should have too!!!"
2,dont buy!,The only reason you should buy this adapter is if you want to play old games. It will work with games like Socom 1. It will not work on any new games. It is worth it to pay the extra money! It is a peice of crap.
1,Don't buy this Adapter,Never buy non-Sony brand products for the Sony Playstation 2. Anything but Sony is junk and anything that is Sony is the best. Always buy Sony products all the time. Sony makes the best electronic items and is always worth the extra cost.
4,crazy is as cool,i bought this and it was so great u should buy it it is so so good so get now in stores
4,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF U PLAN TO PLAY SOCOM 2 ONLINE,"at first, i had no problems with this adaptor. It was easy to hook up and there was no lag. I played socom navy seals and madden 04 w/ no lag or other problems. Then i purchasd socom 2, only to find out that this piece of worthless junk is not compatable with socom 2 or other future sony ps2 online releases. do not buy this, do not make the same mistake i did."
1,"Don't buy this, it's not worth the money or Savings","You're better off bying the Offical PS2 network adaptor, this thing isn't worth it because of three reasons, 1) some games won't work with it like Midnight Club, and future games will not support a USB Network adpator, 2) The thing's connection isn't very good to beging with, the connection on this thing doesn't hold sometimes and even on Socom which it's best with will have issues, 3) you can't hook up the PS2 harddrive to it like you could with the PS2 Adaptor. Pay the extra money and get the better one, not this peice of crap."
1,Terrible Tech Support - Buyer Beware,"Yes the thing works with the few mulitiplayer titles BUT they have a tech issue with ATV FURY 2 and they are too busy to send out the update disks. I've been trying for a while and others have been waiting like 3 months. gonets support says to email but you will never get a response from anyone other than support. And they cant help you. Also SONY WILL NOT SUPPORT anything to do go.net. I shudder to think all the other titles they will have problems with. Get the Sony adapter, it works and Sony will support it. Go.net is a piece of junk they sell before its tested and they really don't want to support it."
1,This is stupid!!!,I was so happy when I got this thing. I tried it out and it didnt work. I emailed the company and waited for the reply. They sent me a list of games that worked. The were all games that were from like 2 years ago! I had one of the games and tried it out. The thing said it wasnt connected! It made me so mad! Dont wast your money or time on this.
1,what a piece of ****,this thing was great for old games not any lag i was having a great time the onbly reason i bought was cause it cost $8 due to mislabeling but i got it low price anyway now this piece of crap wont work and says its not connected when i look at the stupid thing and it is only buy if your cheap bast@rd with only old games
5,well,"This isn't the most anticipated cd to come out from the Cross Movmement, but people are looking forward to it. I hope he has stepped his game up like every other artist in the Cross Movement has. Either way, as long as he's sharing the gospel of Christ, that's what matters most."
1,Not for Modern Children,"This 1949 book is inapppropriate for modern children. In one story, it manages to be insulting to both black Africans and Native Americans! The black African characters are referred to as ""savages"" and described as being afraid of rain, while their medicine man is referred to as a ""sorcerer."" In a prior related scene, the elephant children dress up as ""Indians"" in feathered headresses and play with bow and arrow.This Babar story has become hopelessly dated by modern standards, and should be relegated to collectors."
4,almost perfect,"This is a classic! I almost forgot about how catchy these little tunes were. Great memories from my college years. For the first solo record by an artist this is one of the best. Better than ""McCartney"" by far!"
5,Go ahead - fall in love with a classic,"Those that have heard this album, song by 'simple song', might feel a new rush of delight choosing to sample the DVD first. In 1971 Nash had blazed a trail with 'Songs for Beginners' -- but by 2008 he has revisited and enhanced its whole terrain. The music has been remixed using the 'surround' concept one enjoys when hearing 'Songs for Survivors' -- making beloved songs fresh again. And it is a blessing for all involved that clever, clever Graham gets to share his artistic vision with his lucky, lucky audience. No one even remotely involved or interested in the creative process should miss that interview. Period.Not to be missed, and better than a mere replacement of a worn out vinyl copy. Well done, Mr. Nash and all others concerned, well done."
2,Better off with the original recording...,"I have two main problems with this re-mix:1. The CD is VERY compressed and clips with practically every drum kick. It's just as loud as a modern metal CD! why do this? HIGHER VOLUME DOESN'T EQUAL HIGHER FIDELITY!2. It sounds like a completely different album. With all the wizardry of modern studio equipment they pretty much made this sound like it was recorded yesterday. Why? This is not the ""songs for beginners"" you grew up on. The new mix reveals many things you never heard before but obscures many of the subtleties of the original.In the end, I can't give it one star because I love this album so much; but this isn't really it... I'd take a scratched-up dollar bin vinyl copy over this release any day of the week."
5,REMEMBER WHEN?,"I SPENT A LOT OF TIME LISTENING TO THIS TWENTY-SOME ODD YEARS AGO. FROM BEGINNING TO END, THIS SELECTION BRINGS BACK A VERY HAPPY, CAREFREE TIME IN MY LIFE. ""I USED TO BE A KING, AND ""THE SLEEP SONG"",ARE MY FAVORITES. I HOPE YOU'RE OUT THERE NANCY, CAUSE THIS ONE'S FOR YOU."
3,average,Apart from military madness i did not find a great deal to leap about to. Rather dull in places and maybe alright for background music
5,Beautiful...,"I bought this album last Christmas because Graham Nash is my favorite CSNY member, and I definitely was NOT disappointed with this effort. At this point, Simple Man is my favorite song... incredibly heart-breaking. Highly recommended."
3,good old stuff,If you're missing the early days of Graham solo carrier you must buy this CD-DVD. Good value price. The sound is great and music good as ever.
5,Graham's best,"I have never grown tired of this album. ""Wounded Bird"" is a classic Nash song in the truest sense.... Great guitar melody flowing behind a poetic lyric only Graham Nash could write. ""Simple Man"" & ""I used to be a King"" are also fantastic songs to listen to over & over again. ""Be Yourself"" & ""There's only one"" draws you into singing along.....just can't help it. ""Military Madness & ""Chicago"" feed on Nash's political leanings & quality songs as well. If you are CSNY fan, you won't be disappointed with this contribution."
2,Durable? No way.,"Let's face it, we buy these to dance. It's not like we're little kids and hammer the @$%( out of them or anything. And yet, by the second or third use they are popping apart. My advice is to go ahead and open them when you get them and crazy glue them back shut. Then maybe they will last a whole season. Maybe."
5,My 3 year old loves it!,"My 3 year old daughter recently was given the Disney Princess Vanity for her birthday & she absolutely loves it. It is a perfect size for her and has some neat accesories with it so that she can brush her hair and put on ""make up"". I think that it is a great product for the price as well."
1,TOO SMALL!,"I'm shocked that this vanity suggests an age of 4-8 years! My 4.5 year old daughter can barely see herself in the mirror because, although she's average height for her age, she's too tall to see herself in the vanity's mirror because it's so dinky. The stool is ridiculous. It's so tiny that my daughter actually sits on it with her knees bent to the floor.Don't waste your money unless you're buying this for a 1 year old."
5,Easy to put together,Our grand daughter love this gift more than any others she received this last Christmas. She is 2 1/2 and the stool fit her perfectly.
3,It's not a toy they will play with for long.,I was a little bit disapointed with this product. My children did not play much with it. It was fun the first couple of weeks but that was it. They outgrew it really fast.
2,Who recommends the age range?,"A friend asked what she could get my little girl for her 5th birthday and I suggested this vanity. It looked so cute. When we got it and put it together, it was very, very small. We sent it right back and got the Barbie vanity. I can't believe that the age range includes up to 8 years old-NO WAY!!! I put 4 stars for fun because my daughter thought it was fun and wanted to keep it. Her knees hit the top of the vanity and she barely fit on the stool...she's not a big child either. This is best suited for a 2 year old, possibly a three year old."
1,There is nothing like making an excuse for Santa,"I bought this vanity last year for Christmas after my 4 year old daughter wouldn't stop hounding me for it.On Christmas Eve I put it together and the lights and sound didn't work. I just missed the closing time @ TOYS R US, so I figured I will leave it out anyway.When my daughter woke up she loved it, except she couldn't fit her knees underneath.I now had to explain that the lights and sound didn't work and my daughter showed little interest when she realized she couldn't fit her knees underneath.It went back the next day and we purchased a little tykes, much better quality, storage bench, and lighted vanity which she uses all the time."
4,Good Overview of Jefferson,"This is a fairly short but thorough review of Thomas Jefferson. It captures the highlights. Gives you insight into one of the more interesting, important and yet flawed individual who was central to the founding of our nation and of establishing freedom of belief and of the Louisiana Purchase. Hitchens doesn't skimp, all the racist views are in there, as are his rather heretical ideas about religion. At the same time, you get a good understanding of why Jefferson is so important to American History and why any history of America that doesn't include him (Texas), is flawed. It would be impossible to understand our country without understanding Jefferson. This book is good, short, and interesting. Worth reading."
4,Very Interesting,I enjoyed this book but then I really liked this recently deceased Author. It seemed to me while reading this book that nothing much has changd in American politics. We seem to make the same mistakes over and over. I want to also read Jon Meacham's new book on Jefferson.
1,evidence? attribution? facts???,"This little fluff contains not a single note or attribution. Many statements are presented as fact, with no attribution. As no effort is given to a balanced account, either, one must conclude that this is a personal rant. I had hoped to read more about the mind of Thomas Jefferson, not just that of the 'author'."
2,Somewhat disliked this book,Difficult to put into words but I found Hitchen's writing rather high brow and rambling. Off on tanjents. I enjoyed the book somewhat but it seemed more of a compact history rather than a 'good look' at who Jefferson was as a person.
1,The guy rambles,"Boring book, the guy truly rambles; was disappointed especially after I found a good article about Jefferson in wikipedia. What added salt to injury is that I discovered that Hichens was (still is?) a Stalinist - felt that Jefferson might not have liked it had he been alive, i.e. to see a Stalinist as his biographer. Life isnt fair, as daddy says. Finally, I came across a video in which he was debating a British guy, I think his name was George something, he starts combing his hair in the middle of the debate - then he was called Popinjay; couldnt hold my stomach with laughter..."
1,Horrible Read,This book is by far the most simplistic view of Jefferson that I have ever read...although it should be noted that anyone who writes for Vanity Fair is not really looking for depth...I supose some americans (who can barely get past a 10 page book) may enjoy its flimsiness.
4,A different Jefferson,"The book is quite interesting, and Hitchens presents Jefferson with his flaws as well as his triumphs. From the book you get the feeling that his liasiion with Sally was not just sexual. Also, the book seems to show Jefferson as somewhat conflicted over slavery. He freed the children from his liasion, but not his other slaves.I'm enjoying the book very much, and Hitchens seems to have done considerable research, and works from original documents for much of what he reports. He makes Jefferson feel very human. Jefferson is one of my favorite founding fathers, and even though the book shows him as less than perfect, aren't we all, he's still at the top of my list."
4,Jefferson the intellectual.,"Christopher Hitchens has written a brief, concise biography of Jefferson the intellectual. If you are looking for a detailed biography, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking into the ideas, times, books, and people that shaped our third president, this is an excellent place to begin."
3,There are so many Jefferson books...,...and this one is not among the top ten. That should be a helpful enough review for most readers. May I recommend my own listmania--Jefferson's Shadows--as a better starting point for learning about the Sage?
2,Thought it could be better...,"This book I was slightly disappointed in. I am no English Major or book maven, but the style of the writing is so bland and can be very hard to follow. Although there are some VERY interesting facts and stories, it was just a hard read."
3,it is a beginner's,I'm not a beginner builder but i'd figue i'd get it to complete my Wing Gundam collection. it comes with a small sword and two buster rifles that can join.It's very educational because it helps out beginners of gundam modeling. it's not very durable. the arms and wings fall of easily. it's not meant to be played with.MOST MODELS AREN'T MEANT TO BE PLAYED WITH!!!! Just leave it on a shelf and pose its wings and weapons. those are about the only things that move.it looks good though(with gundam paint or markers)
3,Spank you very much.,"I would say this book is a little more than just ""romantica"". Just because the readers are told the main characters fell in love, doesn't exactly make a romance. Was this book erotic? Yes. Good erotica? Eh. BUT the setting and ""story"" development was a unique one and I enjoyed the ""Alice in Wonderland"" references. I am certainly intrigued enough to read the rest of the series..."
5,*GREAT FANTASY*,This is a great fantasy story. Lots of sex! Bit of intrigue. But light and a quick read. I ordered all of the others after I finished this book!
3,Monte Montgomery Live at the Caravan of Dreams,"I have had the privlidge of seeing him live in San Antonio a few times and he is great. However this live CD could be better. I would highly recomend the ""Let Me In"" CD by Ruben V. Or any other CD by Ruben V. He is the best Guitarist in Texas today."
3,There is potential here but it falls short,"As a big Monte fan, I was excited to hear there was a live disc out. It wasn't until after I bought it did I learn of the legal squabbles associated with it.I've had the opportunity to see Monte live and he is very enjoyable. However, I feel this 2-disc set falls short of capturing that. The mix job on the CD is really quite poor in spots.If you're a Monte fan, the CD is worth owning. However, I anxiously await an ""official"" live release."
1,don't buy,"If you have any respect for Monte and what he is about, you will not buy this album. The label went behind his back in releasing this album. He never even knew about the album until right before its release. The company released COD without his approval which to me was just a slap in the face to Monte and his fans. Support Monte and wait for HIS live CD. It will be ten times better anyway."
1,"Shame on Amazon for carrying a ""Bootleg""","I was excited to get a LIVE CD from Monte so I bought this one and later found out it was a bootleg. Monte was asked to sign the CD but he refused and told us why, what an embarrasment. Amazon should be ashamed to carry this CD. I am going to toss this CD and wait for the REAL LIVE CD. I wish I could get money back but I will write it off to BAD EXPERIENCES. Please don't buy this CD as I mistakenly did. Sorry Monte."
3,Genius G-Pen,"I got what I paid for. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the misleading capability. This is a glorified mouse/pen and pad. It has no accuracy and repeatability. The upper-left hand corner of the pad does not correspond to the upper-left hand corner of my screen (I used Windows-Paint). If I lift the pen off the pad, I have to hunt for the point where I left it. All too often I'm running out of screen before I'm running out of pad. And most definitely don't buy this to trace anything, it won't work. As I said, the price is right for technology, but the technology was not right for my needs, mostly drawing and tracing."
3,Good starter tablet...,"Mac users should check the website before installing.Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse. Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment... hopefully it will be updated soon.Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute... sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job. A good beginner's tablet."
2,Works gr8 but mine had a life of 1 yr,"It worked great for me, I loved it. But in 1 year, yes one year, it just stopped working. My daughter has a bamboo that is 3 years and still working. I was so dissapointed for the 1 year life b/c I really liked this tablet. I know it was cheaper than the bamboo, but I guess I got what I paid for. So I just purchased a bamboo."
5,Good for the money,"I bought this when the pen for my Bamboo Fun tablet pen broke, and it would have cost just as much to buy a new one. So far, so good. sometimes it has issues with sensitivity, pressure gauging, but I LOVE it so far. It doesn't have as many functions (no eraser) but it's a good, cheap solution for artists."
1,Pen is defective,"The pen that is necessary for the tablet to work is too small to use the included batteries. When you try to replace the pen exterior after installing the battery following the instructions (they just give pictures), the covering is so tight that the pen does not close all of the way. The pen never got recognized by the tablet. It started to get very hot and started to catch fire. Why would they design a device that does not accept the AAA battery that they provide?I do not see how it is possible that anyone could use this device with the pen that is included. My only theory is that the pen provided for the tablet the I received was incorrect. Either it needs a special (ultra thin AAA) or it is simply defective.I am very disappointed with this product."
5,Enlightening and Entertaining,"It's not easy to write a comprehensive history book that is also engaging and user-friendly. Author, historian, and professor Jeffrey Stewart found the way. In1001 Things Everyone Should Know About African American History, he pens a concise yet encyclopedic narrative that highlights the people and events underlying the amazing story of African American history.Stewart organizes his work around six sections: Gretat Migration, Civil Rights, Science, Sports, Military, and Religion. This is a book you can read cover to cover or one article at a time in any order.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ."
4,1001 Things Everyone Should Know About African American History,"Because African American History is inexorably intertwined with American History, this is a must read book for all Americans. The history that one may have been taught is incomplete without incorporating African American History into the entire fabric of American History."
5,expanding my knowledge,I wanted to add this to my family library so that my kids can learn something new every day about black history
5,Smoothest palm sander yet!,"This sander caused me to put my other finish sanders on the shelf! The dust collector really works, I thought that there was no way a hard canister would catch that much dust, but it does.I have used this as final sanding on several projects now and it has produced excellent results.The only drawback was keeping track of the punch plate for putting the holes in the sandpaper, but that comes from being an older woodworker."
2,Frivolous eccentricities,"2 1/2Enon is an indie band you actually want to appreciate. Their chameleon-like, blank slate, track-by-track approach puts them something akin to the underground Ween, with subtler, though intact humor. But they over-try on so much of their material. This album is full of those kind of tracks- cool ideas that do not nearly effectively gel enough. Hearing a memorably unique standout track like ""Daughter in the House of Fools"", the disposable nature of most tracks is even more obvious."
2,zzzz,"The first few chapters are so confusing, that you're nearly giving up and relisting it on amazon. it does become more lucid afterwards, yet, i'm sure there are other books that are better without the dullness from the onset."
3,Dont go crazy to have this one,"I would have given this a 5, but the recording of this was bad. Other than that, the list of songs are good, but the audio recording was not what I thought it would be. I understand this stuff was recorded back in the day, but come on now.Another good thing was to hear Luther Vandross all over this singing backgrounds!"
4,Two (actually three) of the greatest voices....,"the world has had the pleasure of hearing. I have a special place in my heart for this CD. I bought the album when it was released over 20 years ago....almost wore it out! And I once sang ""If Only For One Night"" in a talent competition. This was before Luther did the song and worked his magic on it (there was no magic when I sang it). And speaking of Luther...guess who's doing background vocals on this album. Yes, Luther, before he stepped up to the foreground! Both Roberta and Peabo have wonderful voices and together, they are fantastic as well. By now, some of the songs are a little dated but if you like both of these singers, the songs work because of the singers."
2,Bad James Brown covers!,"I love traditional indian music, also funk, and even obscure psychedelic indian/sitar fusion music. But this record can't decide what it wants to be. It's like a cheaply made James Brown cover album played on a sitar replacing the vocals. It's just not very creative. I expected more."
1,Waste of a good concept,"I was NOT impressed with the album - it was no more than a collection of James Brown songs, but without the funk, without the creativity, and without the spirit. The songs were as stiff as if the musicians playing them were wearing suits made of wood."
4,Great!!!,This is a great tool for every dancer that is called to use their gift in the body of Christ!
4,Great book!,This book is filled with lots of good solid information on praise dance.I read it and really was blessed by it.It is a wonderful gift or study guide for you or your dance ministry.
4,Awesome,This is an awesome book....I like how it broke down the different types if dance!!! The first half if the book I was already familiar with the gift of dance but this book is a must for the beginner dancer!!!
4,Microsoft Visual C# Step-By-Step : John Sharp,"This book help me a lot in terms of the basics of C# language and introduction to object oriented programming (oop), it also help meto have a deeper understanding in the .Net Framework using C#.It's good for beginners and intermediate programmer like me toexpand their knowledge to this programming languages.I will use my gain knowledge in preparation for my MCP Certificationin Microsoft Visual C#. NetThank you! to the Author/s who work on this book for sharing theirwisdom to me.Good day and to all Letranites .. Arriba !!"
3,A book for beginner,"This will be a good book for a beginner to programming itself, let alone C#.An experienced programmer in any language will find this book fairly shallow. The book covers many basic topics including some programming basics but doesn't go into detail on any aspect or feature of C#."
4,Good Starter and detailed,"I am a software developer with 20+ years experience. I wanted to move from VB, Powerbuilder and Access to C# and .NET. This is an excellent book to take you from the bottom up. It is not the end of the line but an excellent intro and the examples / exercise are very detailed and clearly explained. I suggest that you programmers out there try and play around outside the exercises to get a better handle of things. Also if you are using MS Visual C# Express 2005+ you will get lost on few steps since his exercise uses a slightly different version, but nothing you couldn't figure out in couple of minutes. Recommended"
5,Awesome Book,This book was exactly what I needed. I was in a crunch and needed to modify a c# program and i needed to learn it quick this was one of the best books ever thanks so much.
3,a little too quick for a step by step book,"although the book has lots of good ideas, it lacks examples. It is short on explanation being a beginners level book, the book would need another 100 pages of more elaboration and explanation."
3,A Good Starter - But Incomplete,"This contains what you'd expect to learn about the basics of C#. It does not contain anything on MDI forms, Redo/Undo, or working with MDI dynamic Menus. It is just the basics. I'll sell you mine if you really want a copy."
5,Well written and comprehensive,This is a very friendly yet challenging work on learning C# with many references to C++ as well. The examples are easy to follow and understand and motivate the subjects very well.
1,Poor and Convoluted Writing,"I am a beginner, therefore, can not comment on the technical merits of the book. However, I will comment that the author expresses poorly and writes worse. It is painful to follow his convoluted logic, and time consuming to read poorly constructed sentences strewn throught the book.I definitely would not recommend this book for the beginners."
3,"Good intro, but falls short in some areas","Overall I really liked this book. Though, I've found that in learning C# -- you'll require an assortment of reference and guidance books to successfully complete your journey. Mr Sharp does a great job in the early sections of the book and his step-by-step examples are also good.The section on indexers was extremely disappointing as the examples were very, very abstract. Also weak, the delegates/events section was extremely brief. I'm happy that I've read the book, but it alone will not prepare you to writing robust production level code. Overall I really liked this book, but for upper level C# concepts you will need to look elsewhere."
2,Missing Pages,"I liked this book a lot until I got to page 164. The text then skipped to page 197. I know I could get a replacement, but I have written notes all through the first part of the book. Buyer beware; check it out before you start reading."
4,Love the writing style,"I give this book four stars simply because in his first book he already has a writing style that made the book extremely enjoyable. The main character in the book was honest, witty, and very easy to connect with. I think Sedlack relayed the inner thoughts, dilemmas, and turmoils of disenchanted youth with unbelievable accuracy and insight. At times I felt as if I was reading my own thoughts. The author's honesty proved very entertaining and very comical.This book would be an easy 5 stars if there was a more developed plot. I think he might wanted to keep the plot simple so he could have room to vent the thoughts of the main character on a regular basis throughout the novel. However, it would be very interesting to see a mix of his writing style with a bit of Chuck Palahniuk style plot mixed into it.If he continues to grow as a writer he will be AMAZING. He is already very, very close."
2,A fun read,"I recommend this book. This was a fun summer read. While saying this I also must explain to you that this book is not meant to be anything more than a summer adventure. As I look back to my summer adventures, though they are not as explosive as the African Safari our hero embarked on, are just a break from the routine life that I was accustomed to. Similarly with our hero who after returning from the trip will leave Africa behind and all his troubles. That is why this book must be read with that in mind. Our hero is 19 so of course he think his wisdom is worthy of contending against Solomon in his pride. His spirituality and philosophizing is not meant to blow the reader away in awe, but to be viewed condescendingly by the reader. Condescendingly as in, ""Ah, yes. I remember being 19 and being that silly."""
5,Great Guide,Great guide. My instructor uses it for our class. Easy to read and has great suggestions. Sample questions for typical IT interviews and gives hints on how to approach an interview. I recommend this book.
3,Good book for interview pointers,This is a good book for anyone seeking job in IT profession. Most of the topics mentioned are relavent to present day. The reader should not be 100% condidence on everything mentioned in this book. Networking with other professionals would help to reduce that risk.
2,old hoth luke is better,"now i've heard a bunch of crap on the old hoth luke about its artciulation and a bunch of other crap well its not true the old luke was better because of its color scheme,durability and its detail so what if it can't have as good of a lightsaber fight this one face is so stupid with the scratches on it. if you want a good hoth luke go with the old one if you can find it this one isn't worth your money"
1,Disapponted : (,"I have been wearing Sonia Rykiel perfume for many years. I only ordered it online once and it was fine. I recently ordered it again online but it does not smell exactly the same. It is very similar but not exactly the same. I am so disapponted! I think the manufacturer changed the combination of ingredients. The original perfume has a very distinct scent. There is no other perfume out there that smells like it. Anyway, I am searching for a new perfume. This won't be easy."
1,Bad Toy!,I give this item no stars. It is not for a 5 yr. old. I could barely put it together. The plastic is not lego type plastic - it is not a fun toy. It falls apart when it is being played with.It would be fun for an older kid who is into model making - not playing with.
1,"Cute, but way too heavey to wear.","these shoes are really cute, but extremely heavy. My daughter had constant problems with them coming off her feet because of the weight."
4,"""Midget""","The Hoth Rebel trooper is a worthy collection addition, but it is flawed. First of all, its ""scrawny"". It's way too small! Also, it has low articulation. The main articulation problem is the arms. Because of his long rifle on short arms (especially the right arm, its kind of bent) he looks weird. If you are looking for one to add to your army, might I recomend a POTF2 hoth figure bought on eBay?"
3,Half of the story,"Yes, this book is a wonderful reference tool, but it does a great disservice to the Pagan Community at large. There is a complete other half to the relegion that is ignored here. Still, it is worth both your time and your money."
4,Nice,"This is a wonderful book despite some mistakes. Like Chandi is the wrathful form of Kali but she spells it Candi and does not state this. Not every goddess is listed here. Like you wont see Dhumavati, or Tripura Sundari, Kaal Ratri. Otherwise its a nice book, pretty big too."
2,"I want pressed daul layer DVDs, Not single layer DVD-Rs","I Have a DVD recorder set-top box as my main player with no intent to copy these DVD-Rs and do not want a player only box, So why am I penalized because I don't have a player only set-top, Plus Burn type DVDs don't have good archival life-span which is 2-7 years then read errors happen, while press DVDs live for 100 years!!!! I have season 1 and season 2 vol 1 on pressed DVDs Which play on all players even recorders and PC Drives. They will work 25 years from now but burned DVDs will not. The 2 star rating is because of the burned DVDs otherwise it would be 5, Simply because it completes season 2. But like I said, Vol 2 will not play in the future because of the dyes in DVD-Rs fading away over time. Another thing, They are single layer DVD-Rs meaning you lose 50% quality. The press DVDs are dual layered. I'll wait until they produce pressed DVDs for season 2 vol 2 and season 3, And any other DVD releasses of any titles."
5,No arid book this,"I read this in one sitting, just as one of the blurbs on the back jacket said I might. It is a beautiful tale of the love shared by a mother and daughter. Young Cedar and her mother live communaly in the US south during the Vietnam era. Time passes, and the men in their lives--be they husbands, fathers, or lovers--depart, leaving mother and daughter to cling to each other. Cedar is one of the most loving creatures I have come across in literature, and Ms Peacock has produced an excellent work of fiction."
5,Great War Story!,"While the idea of a part Japanese/Seneca Indian Cavalry sergeant is a little far fetched the story stands up well. The characters are well rounded and real people with real problems and feelings. The research seems to be flawless and the story flows well. The only thing I would have liked was a final chapter about Elijah and what he did after the war, but I guess the author was leaving room for a sequel...If you like a good story this is a good one and I will look for other works by this author!"
2,"Slow moving and, well, tough to stick with","I found this book to be a rather slow read. I kept thinking, ""get to the point."" It did not until the half way mark. There were some interesting analogies and some rather wise and thought provoking moments, but it lacked the ability to sustain my interest. I finished the book, but felt I had to force myself to do so. If you like a book that grabs you, moves quick and delivers practical advice, then you might want to continue shopping. If on the other hand you don't mind trudging through another prayer how-to book in hopes of finding a rich morsel or two, then this book might be worth your energy."
4,Take a look,"A recipe book for praying. Felt a bit more heart-felt than some of the religious/Christian books - like he was having a revolution in his own heart and presenting to others to create a dialogue, rather than just being a ""do-this-and-be-better"" thing."
5,I started to find praying exciting!!!,"I would start praying and find myself,supposedly talking to God and redecorating my upstairs bedroom at the same time!!!This"" Papa Prayer "" praying knocks you into the presence of the Father, and gives you a handle on introducing complete strangers as well as the church folks into the ""supernatural Presence of God""!!!Expect a dynamic change in your praying!You will never find yourself trying to pray prayers that ""sound good"" again!!! Granted many people refuse to believe they put people to sleep with their prayers!If you are satisfied,DON't buy this book! It will devistate you!Or like me you will rejoice in finding how simple but amazing it is to ""sit on the Fathers lap"" and call Him ""Papa""!!!"
4,"""Good, but still left me thirsty""","I have always been interested in three things when it comes to books on prayer:1. Solid scriptural foundation2. Easily explained to me3. Thorough and complete coverageI will say that Crabb gives me the first two, but leaves me still thirsty regarding the third. I do feel this book is better than most on the subject, but other than my two favorites: ""God, Help Me Pray!"", and ""With Christ in the School of Prayer"", there just doesn't seem to be much available that's solid.Maybe few authors really know how to pray..."
2,Poorly edited and heavilty padded,"This book is really a 40 page pamphlet that has been heavily padded to 200 pages.Crabb spents the first 100 pages telling you the same thing over and over and over again until you finally begin skimming pages, hoping he'll get to ""the point.""Bascially, the premise is to ""be real"" with God and that is a great and right goal. But this book is (again) so heavily padded and redundant that it could have been said in 50 pages."
1,The Papa Prayer,"I was extremely disappoined in this book. Based on the title I was sure this was what my prayer life needed, excited in the possibility that there would be great advances in the direction my prayer life would be directed.What a disappointment when I came to page 172 ""A Simple Four Day Plan"". The four day plan was a tremendous disappointment. The Author should have had the book profed for reader comprehension and asked ""are the sample 4 days of prayer easily applicable""? The book is one I would not recommend!"
5,the best Hasil CD!,"this is by far the best of the available Adkins CD's. Not much has been done in the way of transferring his vast (over 7,500) amount of songs to CD, but if you're looking for a starting point, this is it. It contains his most famous songs- No More Hot Dogs, The Hunch, and Chicken Walk among others. But, EVERY song on this disc is a true classic in its own right. It can't really be described as classic rockabilly music, but the man is very eclectic, unique, and he definitely has a way with words. A wonderful slice of Americana! The song quality is very primal (it was recorded on a home tape recorder with Adkins doing all the instruments himself).The liner notes provide a good bit of info, and there there are also some great photos.(since Amazon has no product image, this is the one with the orange and blue cover)."
3,Songs are great!,The quality of the recording is awful. This really is in desperate need of a remaster.
2,"One Love, One Flaw","This could be an excellent resource for the reggae collector if only it had an index. Useful, sensible reviews of many reggae CDs are arranged in four sections, loosely chronological. It's often necessary to flick through two or me of these sections to find what you want. Without an index, I'd recommend ""The Rough Guide to Reggae"" or ""The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae"" over this."
5,Because Chelsea Hotel is one of the best songs ever!,"Dan Bern, as always, shines. His lyrics are heart-felt, humorous at times, phenominal, and ever so real. All Dan's music is amazing, and this is no exception."
3,Why bother with Chelsea Hotel?,"Dan is the man. but why did he have to put another version of chelsea hotel on this EP? Any dan fan has heard that song 5 million times already. However, the rest of the songs are great. Joe Christ is particularly good. I remember seeing him perform that song live for the first time at Joe's Pub in NYC."
5,The Best from the Florida Breaks era,"Putting into words an accurate description of how epic this CD is, is challenging. For starters i have lived in Florida when the the break beat scene was at its peak and have listened to this type of music over a decade. This CD tops any CD from its genre ive ever come across in my opinion. All i can really say is it is a MUST buy if you like break beats or are into any kind of dark sweeping deep synths with an exotic bass line. Infiniti delivers and keeps on delivering. It is a rare case of an album that u can play all the way through with hardly any gaps in quality. I particularly like almost all of the tracks and will never get tired of this albums unique style. There really is nothing in the dance music world that is quite like it. I can pop this CD in at anytime and be satisfied with hitting shuffle. All in all, one of the better decisions ive ever made purchasing any CD. If this is your type of music... Don't hesitate"
3,The Only Reason To Own......,"Correct title is ""20 Christmas Stars II""This is the only place to find the original version of Sinatra's last recording - Silent Night - without the later added orchastral backing.An unusal recording...recorded in 1991, in Beverly Hills. Sinatra was accompanied by family members including Barbara & his granddaughter. The song was laid down with just piano for musical support. Frank Sinatra Jr is playing. The vocal is very poor & a choral track was added the next day to ""sweeten"" it. A video of the session has been released on the Reprise Sinatra Christmas Collection CD"
3,Nice jacket but loose waist cuff,"First off descent jacket. My main complaint is the waist cuff is loose so it deletes the purpose of trapping in heat and keeping you warm. I will have to take it to a tailor to fix this. However the jacket does feel nice an it has been cozy an warm as a outer shell here in eastern/northern nevada where's it common to reach single digit and -0 degree tempatures during the winter. The jacket is warm with the exception of the loose waist cuff letting in cold air, but you don't really notice it much until a breeze comes along. I would of rated higher if the waist cuff was nice an tight an if the shipping wasn't so long. Overall an okay buy."
5,Best Jacket I've ever owned,I work outside in North Dakota after moving here from Florida. I've never had to own a heavy jacket. Theis is the best piece of clothing I own. The quality is unsurpassed. Believe the patch Carhartt is the best!
5,Great book about a couragous woman!,"Kira Salak is an amazing woman who beats the odds and proves everyone wrong. No one believes that a woman can travel the 600 miles journey down the Niger River and reach Timbuktu. This journey has never been accomplished and especially not by an American Woman. Enduring tropical storms, hippos, rapids, the unrelenting heat of the Sahara desert and the mercurial moods of this notorious river, she traveled solo through one of the most desolate regions in Africa where little had changed since Mungo Park was taken captive by Moors in 1797. Who was the last person to try this journey and did not make it to the end. She finally arrives at Timbuktu weak and strong in triumph. Kira's courage is amazing in this novel and shows how you can overcome fears and go on to live a legacy. It gave me a different perspective in my life and had me searching for what my fears where and how I could accomplish them."
4,Interesting and well-written,"Salak is a good writer who tells an interesting story of her journey through Mali. She weaves in journal excerpts from the first white man ever to reach Timbuktu. At times I cringed from her lack of cultural sensitivity, but overall it was a good read."
3,Not the best...,"The book is abou Kelly who inherits the posession of her uncle. She goes to Arkansas, where he lived, and meets a friend of his and evantually falls in love.It's the standard Harlequin Romance, nothing exceptional."
3,missing pages,"i enjoyed the book, but several of the pages were missing at the end. it's hard to tell how many pages as there are no page numbers on the kindle, but i would say at least 3. disappointing. now i have to find another way to read what i missed..."
4,Mastered irony,"I would agree with the editorial reviews above, especially with regard to the book's wide range and readability. For those interested in Kierkegaard, it is worth noting that he provides a helpful comparison between SK and Richard Rorty on the issue of irony. As the title suggests, Prickett sees the world in terms of ironists and fundamentalists, and ends up placing SK in the former camp and Rorty in the latter. According to Prickett, Rorty is guilty of developing what he labels a ""closed system"" with ""no external reality-check."" He therefore finds SK's approach of ""mastered irony"" far more helpful. This discussion is carried on in Brad Frazier's work, and while Frazier comes to similar conclusions he is less dismissive of Rorty's contributions."
1,good for a while.. then dies out days later!! Rating: F - - -,"Well, it was a cool little light, uses very little electricity.Worked good for a few days, then it started flickering, and died out.Returned it for a replacement one (because I thought mine was just defected).The new replacement did the same thing. Worked good for a few days... then the same thing happened, it starting flickering and it is starting to die.Unfortunately, you can't return replacements to Amazon.com.That, sucks!! This product is just junk waiting to be bought. No wonder it's so cheap."
5,Hard hitting lyrics,These guys are hard. if you want to hear the true raw skills of hip hop here it is.Zero tolerance need to be out there. wish they can get back to do a reunited tour. its so refreshing to hear tru hip hop once again. love them. buy this
4,It's Tull,"Hving long been a fan of Jethro Tull, this is a ""must have."" A great compilaiton of familiar hits with some not so familiar, yet truly Gaelic."
3,Missing Tracks,"I finally decided to buy a bunch of Tull CDs as I only have these on vinyl and this was one of the ones I purchased. I should have noticed from the track listing as well the fact that there is only 1 disk, but I was hoping for the complete ""20 years"" on CD, not just ""selected"" tracks. What's here is fine, but I was hoping for the whole package. It would have been nice if the product description or title had made that clear. If you too are looking for the original complete package, be careful, this may not be what you want."
5,Wonderful! Reveiw by a 12 year old,"This is a wonderful book! It tells the story of a young girl who is a preachers daughter and faces always moving from place to place, therefore never having any friends. When Jo moves to Jericho, she finds a new friendship in an unexpected person. She must face the racism in her town and help her friend overcome it and other challenges. This is a wonderful book, for all ages!"
5,Listen to this and your ears will thank you.,"I often say that you need at least three people to be a good band. These TWO guys make that theory shaky. They mix the rhythm of electronic with a little pure rock bass. While the album features two tracks from the film Appleseed (""Dive for You"" and ""Anthem(Reprise)"") the real audio pleasure comes from songs like the energetic ""Moment I Count"" and somber almost reflective ""Let It All Come Down"". This was a must have for quite a while before I picked it up and I think you'll enjoy it too."
4,I really enjoyed this album,"I got turned on to Boom Boom Satellites about 2 years ago and have been a fan since. This was probably my favorite album that i've heard from the group. I really enjoy their sound because it's so different. My personal favorites on the cd are ""Dive For You"" (from the Appleseed movie),""Let It All Come Down"" and ""Stride"". Great album!!"
5,Great Introduction to the heart of Islam,"As a muslimah, I embrace these works with Joy. I also grew up on the era of Cat Stevens and even sang some of his classics such as ""Morning has Broken"" In our high school chorale ensemble and never realized I would listen to him again in the future with a changed outlook. If you are looking for the old songs you will find them here again with a new twist and new approach. They are a good choice for a contemporary muslim looking for venue in which to listen to something permissible as this is a collection of works and nausheeds from his early years in Islam where he used the permitted Percussive instruments and methods often only allowed in the more conservative circles. Listen and appreciate, but remember This is Yusuf, judge it for its merits and not as a comparison to the works of the ""Cat""Shukran again brother Yusuf."
2,Footsteps in the Light - Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens),"I bought this after purchasing ""Another Cup"". (which I thoroughly enjoyed) With the exception of maybe two tracks, this is a journey into the heart of Islam. I guess that's ok if you're into that sort of thing, but if you're looking for the old ""Cat"" you won't find him here."
3,Important the purchaser knows who the book is written for.,"This book is written for daughters in their late 40's and early 50's. It deals with the need they have to reconcile with their mothers. I bought the book believing it would help me reconcile with my 30 year old daughter. I found no value in the book for that purpose. However, it's terrific for the purpose it was written."
2,stilted writing,I have to admit that I haven't finished this book so it may not be a fair review - but... I read lots of stuff and am not one who picks apart writing - but this writing just felt awkward and unnatural. I rarely don't finish a book I start - but so far - this one joins that list.
4,Fascinating Read,"What a great book! Reading about this family was amazing, the challenges they worked through and the love they shared, were inspiring. I would recommend this book."
3,What Love Sees--a heart-wrenching story about a blind family.,"""What Love Sees""--Excellent book--it got off to a bit of a slow start--but the story-line was excellent. Not necessarily a ""must-read"", but a good, solid story."
4,Insight!,"This is a well-written, uncomplaining revelation of life as experienced by a blind young child-to-woman-to-wife-to-mother in a world where others see what she cannot. What a tool it was for me to experience vicariously only a bit of how that is--how it feels, how much it hurts, how it can restrict. The world is scary but life requires living. This is a brave story SO worth reading."
4,A Great Story of Overcoming obstacles,I found it hard to believe that people who came from plenty could adjust to their lifestyle. They did a wonderful job raising their family.
4,A great story ...,...about making the best of life with the cards you are dealt.I fell in love with all the characters and didn't want the book to end. The obstacles and triumphs of the main characters was truly awe-inspiring.If you like true stories and real life...I highly recommend this book as it has become one of my all-time favorites.
4,What Love Sees,What Love Sees was an insightful and sweet novel. It was easy to get into and it keeps your attention to the end.
3,Interesting,It was interesting to read how a blind person would cope from childhood to motherhood. It was a departure from Susan Vreeland's novels.
4,What Love Sees,"Really good book. It helps you to enter the world of a young woman who cannot see, and how she tries to live a normal life. I really enjoyed this as it was well written and just a good read."
4,Sensitive book about a real family,"I enjoyed What Love Sees, as I do most stories about real people struggling to overcome real life obstacles. This memoir speaks to the old adage that anything can be accomplished with will and determination. I have long admired the writing of Susan Vreeland, even more so after reading this very endearing book."
3,The demise of Jenny's rings,"Upon receiving an advertisement e-mail from Amazon offering various Kong products, we attempted to use it to order ten of the old-style 9"" donut rings that Kong used to make. Unfortunately, by the time the order got to us, it had changed (either we accidentally changed it or it was changed for us), and we ended up with the 6 inch fat and heavy donuts that our dog won't even touch and has no interest in.Further investigation reveals that the old 9"" rings are no longer around. Too bad. The new ones are useless, and since it looks like that's what we ordered, we're stuck with the dam things.Guess we'll keep looking."
3,Squeeker dog toy,"KONG Air Dog Squeaker Donut Dog Toy, Large, YellowSome dogs will love this heavy duty rubber toy. The surface of the donut shaped toy is similar to that of a tennis ball. It will pick up small grass particles and dirt etc. My dog has a problem with his. He does better with it in the house. I would not leave a pup unattended with the item as it may be penatrible. It is one of the sturdier toys around."
5,love it,"The product was as I expected it to be. Good quality, good price. I received it on time. My kid loves it."
2,Good prose not enough to overcome the tedium,"I wanted to recommend this work, but find I can't. The book is clearly directed at the English, with a supposition that places/names/dates are already part of the reader's cultural literacy. Without that grounding, this effort becomes a tedious read relying on someone spending inordinate time consulting outside resources.To her credit, Lady Fraser writes fine prose, and the level of detail would be engaging if it weren't for the issues I note above.Bottom line -- if you are from Britain and interesting in a deep dive, then this is probably a good buy. If you're from elsewhere, it would behoove you to do some pre-reading on English geography, English history between 1300 and 1700, and a healthy dose of ecclesiastical literature before tackling this. Otherwise, seek an overview if you want the 'high points' of Cromwell."
3,The Controversial Cromwell,"Fraser's book ""Cromwell"" is a very well written book about the life of a controversial man. Some people enjoyed his life and others hated it. I feel this would be a great book for anyone writing a paper on his military life or the English Revolution. She does a fairly good job in explaining his life as a military leader. This book also goes into great detail about his life. It almost gets to deep into his family and its history. I Liked the book and found alot of information on him during his reign over England. I found the book useful, because I was writing a term paper on the English Revolution, and it contained alot of the details I was looking to find. This book is not useful unless you are needing detailed information on Cromwell's life as a military leader."

1,****YAWN****,"This book is completely lifeless. This woman has no sense of humor, nor does she know how to tell a good story. There are also so many tedious details that will tend to put you in a comatose state. If someone actually knows of a decent Cromwell bio, please send me an e-mail, because this book was a bore and at times I wanted to quit reading it."
1,Garbage,"Garbage. Vanity Published (well almost, IT IS PUBLISHAMERICA afterall) garbage. Very disappointing. The Author is frighteningly well regarded as a ghost on guru and other sources. I realise now, that's he's popular because he's a cheap ghost option. I'm glad I researched first though. A word to the wise: If you're thinking of using this 'writer' as a ghost for a children's story, by all means buy one of his books first. It's the best investment you'll make."
2,Too bad Time-Life acquired rights to this show,"It's wonderful to have the opportunity to acquire this show on DVD. The jokes are still as corny as ever, the music still as good as ever, and Junior's delivery still cracks me up.The sad thing is, Time-Life is the company putting out the DVD's. These DVDs are a poor value. One show is all that is provided.Also, Time-Life has obviously not seen fit to restore any of the footage. Colors bleed badly (which is extremely obvious on a show with loud sets, lighting, and clothing), and grain is everywhere.Should you buy this DVD, or the subsequent releases? Well, I doubt this show will ever be released as it should have been....in full season sets. So if you want to have copies of this classic, this is probably your only choice. Just prepare yourself to have deep pockets and low expectations."
3,beter and worse than I was expecting,"in response to Yarby Yarby, this DVD, as well as the other 6 in the complete set showed no clor bleeding at all. Just the opposite. Colors were correct in hue and the contrast was excellent. The sound was ok, nothing to write home about but better than it originally sounded on the TV sets back then. My complaint is about the value of the whole set that I purchased from Time Life. Seven DVDs averaging only about 100 minutes, including some repeated material, is a rip-off for $120.00. The series is good enough that it should be offered in complete year sets. I'd buy every one. There is, however, a good sampling of the humor including my favorites, Junior Sample and the jug song about gloom, despair and misery on me. What is offered here on Amazon is the same that stores like Target carry but I encourage everyone to write to Time Life and beg for better offerings. They can do it if they want to"
3,"It's the Hee Haw I remember, but only 1 episode?","On the plus side, it's a complete episode, but $13 for one episode is very steep. The audio and video quality seems great to me, but I'm not ultra-picky.The ""Extras"" are basically throwaways, consisting of links to the cornfield gags (that are already in the episode anyway) and a text list of guest stars (for that year?) That's IT.I'm happy to see this great show again but I probably won't be buying many more Hee Haw DVDs at that price."
4,Always Good Music,"Good Quality CD, I've listened to this cd many times since purchasing it and it just gets better. It brought back a lot of good memories and places."
5,One of my favorites.,"This album is fantastic.I had other james gang album with joe walsh,that is pretty good,the direction of the music is almost the same,but tommy bolin is a genius,a visionary,he had his place in the guitar panteon,togheter with hendrix and page.The energy and the feeling of the album is so intense,is very emotional,very honest.The singer roy kenner is awesome,your voice is a mix of plant with jagger,but with your own style.Every song is a tribute to pure hapiness.This album is obrigatory to all the people that like good music."
3,Not the same without Joe Walsh,"Upon first hearing this album when it was released, I was disappointed. I immediately missed the guitar work of Joe Walsh. Tommy Bolin's guitar sound thin and not as heavy as Joe's and the music suffered as a result. This is NOT the best album the James Gang every recorded."
2,I'm sorry,"Not to be a spoiled sport, but I can't possibly agree that Bang is in the same league as Yer Album or Rides Again. While it has its moments, it wears thin very quickly. It lacks the cohesiveness of the early works, and sounds like a series of also-ran pop singles. You may love it, I certainly don't dislike it. I just think it is a disappointing follow-up to the early works. (Note: maybe it's a contractual issue but I notice not one of the Bang tracks is on the 15 greatest hits CD)"
3,Where's Joe Walsh?,"This is a good solid album. I've had it on vinyl, cassette and CD. It's slow compared to what Joe Walsh would have written but still worth having."
2,second chance,"After growing up and returning to my musical roots, I have tasted the fruits of a number of branches I had never climbed before. I wish I had left Tommy and the rest of The James Gang on the tree. This is not to say that this is a rotten or bad harvest, but that the fruits of my pleasure grow elsewhere. I hope your taste is served by this offering. The original James Gang suites my just fine. Have a taste."
3,Dauby or not Dauby?,"Comments on the book ""History of Printing in Rochester 1816-1834""(In Memory of Augustine G. Dauby, Rochester's First Printer)I purchased the book because it had been written in memory of a Mr. Dauby, and Dauby is my name! His first name was Augustine and my grandfather's first name was Augustin. His father established a steel foundry in Massachusetts, and I am a steelmaker! Too many coincidences!Unfortunately, the book did not help me in my search for relatives in the U.S. (my family tree goes back to 1585 in Belgium). Anyway, I enjoyed reading the book and learning on the birth of the printing business in Rochester. There were difficult times for many people. The presentation (cover) of the book is luxurious."
4,My son loves this!,"I bought this for my son after he had been drawing on the walls forever : ( He 19 months old and loves to color, so he was so excited when he saw it. When I ask him if he wants to color, he runs to his room to color on the easel. And he knows to put the crayons and chalk back in the little boxes. Also, it was so easy to put it together. Its pretty much put together for you and you just attach the drawing boards and little containers. I was a little scared it was too tall for him since it says its intended for 3 years+ on the box but it suits him just fine. A great purchase!"
5,Worth it!,"My 2 yr old daughter loves this easel. We really researched them all on the market to get one that would last. This one is sturdy. I like that there are clips to hold paper on both sides so 2 kids can color at the same time. Another positive is the double dishes on each side instead of a small ledge to ""hold"" the chalk. I bought an extra eraser (one for each side)It doesn't wipe it completely clean, but I don't think most do. So I give her a damp cloth to keep in her dish also. Make sure you use the Crayola white board markers for the dry erase board."
5,The Perfect Easel you've been looking for!,"My daughter is 3 and loves to use her easel. This was our 2nd easel, the first one (a different brand) was cheap and poorly designed, the clips broke on the first use and because of a bar running along the floor, it was not easy for her to stand close to it without getting back ache. Not so with this one...because of it's clever design my daughter can stand right up against it. The clips are sturdy and work well, the blackboad wipes clean easily, the little storage boxes make cleanup a breeze. In addition when she is not using it to make art, she crawls under it with her 1 year old sister. Assembly is very easy and can be done in less than 10 minutes. Please note, however, no paper, pens or chalk are supplied."
2,waste of money,At first my daughter loved this and always used it. Three months later and the blackboard can't be used. The chalk won't even write on it any longer. Now I have to purchase another blackboard. This was not worth the money.
3,piece of plastic junk,"We received this easel as a gift for our daughter when she was 1.5 years old. Now, a little over a year later, the blackboard side no longer accepts chalk -- it's been rubbed smooth from use.Invest in a real blackboard, not a sheet of blackboard-like paper pasted onto plastic."
1,dry erase blues,My daughter has been trying to enjoy the crayola double sided easel but it might as well be one sided. The dry erase board stinks. The marker does not erase from the board. I have even purchased and tried to use the EXPO Board Doctor (as recommended by the company)but nothing works. Save your money!! Do not purchase this product. Do not disappoint your child!!
2,an okay book for beginner doll makers,"This is an acceptable book, but nothing special, really. Some of the small dolls are rather cute, but the techniques, particularly those involving clay are very basic, and not explored particularly well. It's nice as far as it goes, but not anything for those who have made dolls before or have much experience."
2,Cheap,"Turquoise Blue Pointy Beaded Tribal Collar NecklaceIt ships in a small plastic square all bunched up. When I opened it, I immediately noticed the beads were cheap AND the necklace was whacked out. The inner thread was distorted and wouldn't lie flat on my body like a necklace, but stuck up and curled inward.I'm flattening it with a book now, and hopefully that'll help. Would NOT buy again, it's not really what I expected...even for five dollars."
5,A safe alternative to Noam Chomsky,"Chomsky and his followers tried very hard to persuade us that we were born with certain language abilities programmed into our DNA. Others believe that our ability to learn, and even to create, languages is a function of our overall ability to learn things at very high levels.If you want to believe that human beings are run by their DNA, the way birds and fishes are, then Chomsky is for you. But if you believe that human intelligence is an ""open"" system that allows complete flexibility in navigating the unpredictabilities of the world, then you might want to make use of the valuable information in this book."
5,Great sprouts,These sprouts are great. Once I got the hang of sprouting I was successful in getting all the seeds to sprout. You really have to make sure the water is drained completely or the seeds rot and don't germinate. This was a really good price at $32 for 2.5 lb but the price went up and I found another place that is selling them for $29 for 2.5 lbs. They're organic too. Wish they weren't so expensive.
4,Keilberth triumphs over Klemperer,"If you are a Mahlerian I urge you to purchase this recording. Otto Klemperer was a classicist and should have had no business recording this disturbing masterpiece alongside someone of Wunderlich's stature. If you are partial to Ludwig's sonorous mezzo, Fischer-Dieskau's rendering of the Abschied might have you frantically looking for a gun. Mahler would have been most proud of this reading from 1964."
5,Finely crafted songs about living between the lines,"This one will be on the critics' ""Best of 2004"" lists--and deservedly so. Jim White's music is utterly unique and at the same time brings to mind numerous of comparisons: with Tom Waits for the commiseration with the down-and-out and the use of quirky, noir humor; with Beck (of the ""Sea Change"" period) for the intimate, introspective singing; with Wilco for the occasional alt-country twang; and with the Cowboy Junkies for the guitar-based melodicism. White's work, however, is much more than the some of its parts. His songs have a real emotional depth that clearly isn't affected or copped from another artist."
3,It's not that great,"I liked ""Static On The Radio"", and ""If Jesus Drove A Motor Home"" when I heard them on David Byrne's internet radio feed. I didn't like anything else on the CD. That's all, over and out."
1,Much less than expected,"I bought ""Outsider Music #2"" hoping it would be better than""Outsider #1"" which I thought was only mildly funny.Unfortunately the producers should have stopped with the first album, as this new one comes off silly and childish.Songs such as ""The Birthmark Song"" and ""Deep BosumWomen"" come off more like ""fart jokes"" that perhapsare funny to 12 year old boys. And even without such anevent as 9-11, the ""America"" track by Snowden seemslike a cheap shot, like somebody intentionally playingthe National Anthem off key, ha ha. The samewith ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" an almost sacredanthem to African Americans, a point that must haveeacaped these record makers. I applaud any effortto present different and funny music, but this try missesthe mark completely."
1,We were hoping would be more enjoyable,"My family and I did not like this CD. The track about America is in poor taste and poorly timed. The other tracks are weird, but won't be played more than once. We were hoping for more bythe description and title.Thank you for allowing us to review this CD.Abbott Franklen from LA"
3,Very pleasing music,"Excellent music to play in the background for a dinner party or for simply relaxing. Not a mundane ""Muzak""-like sound, but music with substantial and intersting structures, thoughtfully played."
5,Early Terry Plumeri arco bass solo,"This album travels successfully into several musical rooms, with an array of great players.My favorite song on this album, is ""Business Goes on as Usual,"" a trio between voice, snare drum, and arco (bowed) double bass.This is a fine example of bassist Terry Plumeri's early sound. With time, work, and vision, this developed into his subsequent, ground-breaking playing style and ability.The introductory theme, ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" is hauntingly played by Plumeri, followed by double-stopped fifths in the bass, slightly wavering in pitch (for effect). Percussion is simple, but effective work on the snare drum. Ms. Flack's voice enriches the upper register, with power and nuance. The climax of the tune is a piercing, very vocal, arco double bass solo, coupled with Ms. Flack nearly shouting the lyrics.While all the songs on this album are lovely things, nothing represents the frailty of human life more aptly than ""Business Goes on as Usual,"" in my mind."
5,"Roberta Flack's ""Reverend Lee"" is HOT!","For 3 months I'd been searching for my favorite Roberta Flack CD, ""Chapter Two"", and discovered the least amount I could purchase it for was nearly $35! I had come to terms with the idea of not owning the CD - where her legendary song, and my favorite Robert Flack song ""Reverend Lee"", is the end all - be all of STEAMY, HOT secular music about a preacher - ""Reverend Lee"", who was hotly pursued by ""old Satan's daughter!"", until I received a $50 Amazon.com gift card from friends for my 60th birthday. Well, needless to say, I am grateful to Amazon.com for making the CD available to me at a rate cheaper than I was finding it elsewhere, and for ""being there for me!!"" I've been enjoying my CD every day since I got it! And I even ordered some old Anita Baker CD's at the same time - for one penny!! You can't beat that! AMAZON.COM, I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL! BLO"
4,Neff,"I enjoyed the book,but was a little disappointed in the photography. How about a little color and some recent photos of still existing houses."
4,Everything in one place...however...,"If you've got the 3 albums on CD from Rhino, the only thing you're missing is the one bonus track Train kept a-Rollin'. That can be found on the vinyl-only Best of Nazz (also from Rhino). The single album reissues did one thing this collection didn't do: it kept the tracks in their original running order, and that's how these albums sound best."
3,Remastered?,"I bought this because I love the first Nazz album & it was cheaper than the remastered ""Nazz"". This CD did not dissapointment me in that respect. The 1st Nazz was great. The rest of the CD was inconsistent. Some songs had no bass at all. The ones that didn't were tinny & crappy. If you liked the the 2nd & 3rd Nazz albums - don't buy this. I will probably never listen to the 2nd disc because of the ups & downs of bass. There is nothing more annoying than getting up & down to adjust the tone, just to hear one album."
5,Liggetts,"I've been using Liggetts bar shampoo for a while now and it's pretty much become my all-time favorite. I have tried a few of their varieties and they provide a natural, pleasant and clean feeling. I recommend! The all-natural shave foam is nice too--not cheap, but it provides a very soothing and comfortable shave, especially for someone like me who has a heavy beard that always comes back in quickly. Everything I have bought from Liggetts gets a satisfied thumbs up. :)"
3,Meh...,"I was looking for alternative to shampoos since I wanted to cut down my plastic consumption. I do like the bar: it cleans well, has a nice scent, no weird chemicals, etc. My hair also feels very soft and has a nice curl to it. The bar is also easy to use and easy to travel with. But it leaves a buildup (I have shoulder length hair, if that makes a difference). If I use it one night it's fine, but then the second night, my hair feels oily. I think it's because I have hard water. If you have soft water, you might have better luck. So now I just switch off between this and regular shampoo and will do so until I've used it up. I wanted to like it, but based on the weird buildup in my hair, I won't be repurchasing. Maybe they could find a way to reformulate for hard water?"
1,My hair feels like STRAW!,"Ingredients: SODIUM HYDROXIDE and essential oils.Unfortunately, the SODIUM HYDROXIDE kills any positive effects the oils might have.BTW, sodium hydroxide is LYE.The same CAUSTIC solution used to clear clogged up drains.Leaves my hair feeling like straw and looking like straw.The LYE totally destroys the natural oils in your hair."
5,The gift from the Heaven,"Ettore was the best and the most incredible baritone of all time. This CD contains many of earlier recordings when he switched from bass to baritone. And he sang absolutely wonderful. He'll take you to heaven when you hear pieces from Forza, Ballo and all the rest. He would have been a great Iago. He proved in this CD. He also proved that he was a great comedian in Barbiere and Maschere. What a pleasure and the gift he'd left with us. I can't thank him enough!"
5,tasty little treat,"I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat. This led to me shopping in health food stores/Whole Foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category. I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any, so I went to Whole Foods near my job. I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them. I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors.Who doesn't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies?!"
5,Great snack,"These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house. Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers, these are a good snack to give to your kids, or eat yourself. I was very pleased with this purchase."
4,Convenient,"Great snack for on-the-go. Kids love them and they are a little healthier than some of the other snack crackers. You pay a bit of a premium for the Annie's products, but they are good and Amazon has them cheaper than my local grocery."
5,CHEDDAR BUNNIES ROCK!!!,"I'm a kid at heart. So I bought these because of the cute name, and I have to say they are just as addictive as the goldfish crackers. I LOVE CHEDDAR BUNNIES!! Thanks for making such an amazing product!"
1,New packaging - and new alert,"Time to order more cheddar bunnies. But, wait, the packaging is new. On further reading on this site, new information is provided - an alert that they are manufactured on shared equipment with peanuts and tree nuts. No!! These were great for my grandson who has those allergies. The previous cheddar bunnies (snack packs)contained wheat and milk - and were manufactured on equipment that also processed egg and soy. They used to be perfect. Now, they will no longer be on my shelf. So sad."
3,way too expensive,"We love these crackers and they are a great alternative to the major brands' fish shaped ones. The little bag is convenient too. However, at more than $2 a teeny little bag that is just way too expensive for our budget. You could buy the regular size box for almost the same price and dole them out into your own baggies."
2,My son does not like it,I bought it for my son who is 2 years 10 months old.He does not like it and is happy with the fish crackers which tastes better than this one.
4,Convenient packaging for toddler on the go,My toddler son loves these cheddar bunnies and I'm pleased to be able to order these online and just have them delivered to my home. The only downside about the small package is that they are probably environmentally unfriendly but at least they don't get stale like the big boxes which I have to pour into his snack trap container.
5,"Yummy, and ""more healthier"" as my kids would say","We love these!Beware, though, the warehouse is sending out the wrong amount. You should get 3.3 pounds of product. That's 6 boxes of 6 packets. If you get a single box, email or call Amazon!Annie's Mac and Cheese is also GREAT - both the single serve and the different flavor boxes.Enjoy!"
3,sisims review,its good for the price but id splash out and go for the more expensive cds if you want quality
5,Worked Great & Saved me Money !,"I was forced to borrow a Pump In Style for my first child because it was so expensive. When I had my second child, I needed to purchase a pump. This pump was half the price but seemed to have even more features than the Pump In Style so I gave it a shot. This double pump works just as well as the Pump In Style but you only need to use one hand to pump! The bag looks similar on the outside but is actually more organized on the inside (there's a designated place for everything!). The bag also comes with the battery option built in (vs. paying extra for a battery piece you need to plug in). This pump works great and I didn't need to take out a loan to pay for it!"
2,Pump,"This pump works very well as many reviews have said, but unfortunately not for very long,mine keeps getting condensation in the air hose and shortly after it breaks, this is my third one, the only reason I still have it despite its unpredictability is Babies R Us took it back with the receipt."
1,This pump is Painful and Awkward!,"The suction is so hard it is painful and frustrating. I hated the thought of having to pump. I had an unexpected cesarean section which left my middle section swollen. Using the ""bar attachment"" they supply to allow you to use one hand was nearly impossible. I now have the Medela and LOVE IT! It is so much more comfortable and efficient.I do have to say that when I called the company to express my dissatisfaction they offered to refund my money, no questions asked. That is great customer service. I wished I would have read the reviews first before I registered for this pump. All I can say is spend the extra money and save yourself the pain and headache down the road. If you cant afford the Medela, rent it, it is worth the money."
1,This pump is horrible!!!! It is worth zero stars!!!,"After returning the first pump I went to use the second one and the motor broke. The manufacturer said they would send me a replacement. I said absolutely not and requested a refund. There I was engorged and in pain with a crying infant. Please spend the money on a Medela. It is not worth saving money if you are going to have to spend time and effort attempting to get your refund. Also, do what I didn't do: research!!!!! By the way, here I am 3 months later and still no refund yet. The First Years customer service stinks!!"
4,Mrs. C,This is a very great breast pump. I love it. It's extremely portable and easy to use. I would recomend this to any nursing mother.
3,Works well but no replacement parts,Works well but I had one of the suction parts stop working properly and no replacement parts are available anywhere!
1,not happy,I had problems when my baby first came home. Thought this pump would save us time when pumping.. Ended up spending more money. Yes costumer srvice was helpful in fixing my pump to start with but then it would hurt to pump. Once I figured out how to get it to express my milk. But it hurt so bad that i couldn't stand to use it at all.. Save your money...
3,great customer service,"I really liked the company's customer service because I was able to return the three breastpumps without having to pay a penny for shipping. They were nice enough to send me a postage paid label and return my money within the 90-day warranty.I have returned three different breastpumps because one stop working (no suction), the second one also stop working, and finally I decided to get the top the line. I went out get the Easy Comfort, at first i was thought it was alright but later i realized that it was really hurting my nipples when i started to pump. I just could not take the pain, I use to sit in front of the pump gathering courage to turn it on. So i returned it and bought the Medela breastpump and have been happy with it.So remember if you are within the 90-days warranty then you can get your money back."
1,Not worth the money!!!!!!!,"Save your money, I've heard $20.00 pairs of speakers with better sound. They have no bass what so ever. It was like listening to music through two tin cans."
5,James Bond watch out!,"Finally, an African-American adventure novel. I could read this this story over and over. The fast paced storytelling reads like a movie. I hope this author is considering a sequel."
5,Inspiring tale for any adventurist,"I picked this book up because I am a gem collector who loves to travel the world and this was exactly what I was looking for! I want to run off to Africa right now and buy a motorbike. It's kind of like Indiana Jones meets ""Blood Diamond."" Don't be confused, this book was written BEFORE Blood Diamond was filmed and is much more adventurous. I am actually on Amazon right now to buy Robinson's most recent book. This is a definite buy!"
5,Graham Greene Fans,"Lonny Cushman is a Greene character in that he is a complex narrator living in self-exile on the periphery of an exotic culture, here Madagascar. Robinson's world view, however, is less jaundice then Greene. Much more action and adventure than The Quite American and with a glimmer of hope for the redemption of his character which is not found in The Power & The Glory or The Honourary Counsel. A great read."
5,A Book That is Hard to Put Down,"The Sapphire Sea is simply an excellent read and is hard to put down. Besides the fact that it is an interesting adventure into a world most of us know very little about, it is also an interesting study of human nature. If you like Hemingway, you'll like this book."
1,I did NOT read the same book,"All these people with reviews here read something well-written, with engaging characters and adventurous plotting.Huh.I read a book with poorly-developed characters, dull goings-on and a very ragged story. At any time, a single paragraph could begin with a character's thoughts, jump right into exposition (which was usually not very useful to the story), and end with the thoughts of a DIFFERENT character. Where was the editor?!By the time it ended, I didn't really care how things turned out for anyone.I want my time spent reading this turkey back!"
4,The intrigue of the exotic,"You keep reading the Sapphire Sea not just because of the compelling story line, but because from your own couch you have entered a world completely unknown to you, but created here with sensual intimacy. You will enter Madacascar, its scarred landscape, its warring tribes and corrupt government. You will lose your sense of reality in a night with the ancestors and you see into a man's heart. It's worth the trip."
5,A Scintillating Adventure Story,"Reminiscent of H. Rider Haggard and Graham Greene, The Sapphire Sea takes off like a rocket on page one and keeps on flying to the very last word. Gem trader Lonny Cushman finds himself with the world's most valuable sapphire in his hands, and soon half of Madagascar knows it-and will do anything to wrest the stone away from him . Resourceful, multi-lingual Lonny dodges dozens of pitfalls in a desperate attempt to escape from the island alive with the gem still in his possession. Author Robinson makes the exotic locale pulsate with danger, sex and treachery. A great read that would make a great movie!"
4,New adventure novel a well-plotted winner.,"If you like adventure and want to learn about the soft underbelly of Madascar, you've come to the right book! This action packed novel will bring comparisons to Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones, but is based on the author's real knowledge gained while living in Madagascar for two years. Lonny Cushman is a member of a gem dealing family in New York, and discovers a huge, perfect sapphire, which he must get off the island. Will he make it? Will he escape with his life and the stone, or neither? A fast paced novel you'll really enjoy."
2,Not what I expcted,"I bought this item along with the D-7AC adapter, as I was led to believe this would also charge my camera while connected.NOT! It just powers the camera while downloading to the PC. Don't make the same mistake I did.. It's a pretty expensive mistake to make."
4,SHOULD BE PART OF ACCESSORY KIT WITH CAMERA,EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE. SO ESSENTIAL THAT IT SHOULD BE PART OF ACCESSORY KIT THAT COMES WITH THE CAMERA!
4,The holy qur'n translation and commentry,Basic Arabic quran is the same and does not change. This quran is mostly shia interpretation and translation. It shows how much can change the interpretatuon by different sects of ISLAM. It is excellent. All SHIAS and SUNIS should read this interpretatation. The commentries are are mostly SHIA TWELVERS point of view. So other shias may not agree with every thing. But it is a must read for all SHIAS and Sunis and others for really deep study of Islam. This Quran opensup some misunderstood avenues in Islamic studies.
5,Los Angeles fresh sounds-killer jazz,"I first heard this disc on the LA freeway at commute time. It was played on KLON by Chuck Niles, the premier jazz jockey. I am ready for new talent in the jazz world and Johnny Souza's ""My shining Hour"" was exactly what I wanted to hear. Johnny's trumpet and all of the band came through as fresh new artist's who sound excited and definitely have a lot to say. I've heard all the giants up close and personal, being into the LA jazz scene. We need new groups, new ideas, new faces and sounds, etc. I hope I get to see the JS group out here on the far out left coast. It's about time. Great. 5 STARS !!"
1,Horrible support experience !,"Nisus has nice software, but they will not support you. Avoid this stuff !! I wrote them about 10 times after my Nisus crashed, and they just blow you off with short e-mails. Terrible support. Avoid at all costs !!"
2,Know your clarity,"Make sure you review the clarity and grading scale before you purchase jewlery on line without seeing the piece first.This is clearly stated as a I2 - I3 clarity grade which is defined as containing large inclusions that are visible to the naked untrained eye.The grading is correct, my wife instantly notice a large black flaw in the diamond. You get what you pay for."
5,Timeless,"This was a first text for countless electrical engineers, and for good reason. To be sure, it reflects its era. But the content remains the cornerstone of a solidly constructed EE education. The style and organization provide an enviable model of clarity and purpose. The preface to the second edition, in which Van Valkenburg quoted A.F. Whitehead on the proper place of proof in education, outlines a philosophy of teaching which is -- if anything -- more and not less relevant today than then. Almost sixty years after its first publication, it would be difficult to overstate the impact this one book has made on generations of engineers. I'm sad to see it out of print and won't be loaning mine out again."
2,Ehhh....,"The book is very old and this edition does no have many problems at the end of each chapter. Also, there should be a solutions manual somewhere out there."
4,Slow but entertaining,"This book tells the story of Sheila Gaynor, a woman trying to discover herself in the late 60's/early 70's, and Phil Gaynor, a man trying to make a place for himself. Though the story begins in a boring and predictable manner, the plot is later supported by the characters' inner conflicts. While the actually story line is not as fulfilling from start to finish as I would have liked it to be, and contains the worst collection of typographical errors I have ever seen in a published book, the view of the characters personlities throughout makes the work a satisfying read."
5,Sex Rev 2.0 is a Fantastic Book!!,"Brilliantly and insightfully written, The Sexual Revolution 2.0 is a must-read for everyone from tech-geeks to soccer-moms to dating-enthusiasts alike! This book can help you explore, understand, and improve your romantic connection and communication. And Ms. Lynn writes with such a witty, intelligent, topical, visual, easy-to-read style -- once you pick up the book, do not expect to put it down anytime soon!"
1,"Extremely boring techical treatise on fire control, not strategy!","The whole bloody book is devoted to the research, development, politics and economics of the Pollen fire control system, which was not adopted by the Royal Navy despite all the horestrading, briberies etc rampant in the Senior Service.There is absolutley nothing on the naval war, strategy and tactics, operations or fleet building.I bought the book as a cheap new paperback, and regret it. So save your money for more worthwhile works."
3,Not a Premium Doc Adventure,"Having fond memories of reading Doc Savage novels more than 20 years ago, I decided to get one off the shelf and read it for the first time.It may have been the luster has worn off over those decades, but this wasn't a premium Doc adventure. The villain -- an Arab -- and his deathdealing gadget -- a portable electromagnetic rail gun -- weren't the most interesting. So, I can't offer this as a good entry point tor the Doc Savage adventures.However, long time fans will appreciate that not only do we get Doc's submarine, the Helldiver, but also the story of Monk getting his pig Habeas Corpus.Of course, there's the usual New York City locale, international travel, lost races, and a putative treasure.Still, I think I'll be revisiting this old friend again."
3,Super Reader,"A fast start, with a quartet of Arab assassins with poison weapons looking to prevent Doc numbering among the living for much longer.They capture him, and for some reason want a submarine. He takes them to the Hidalgo trading company and gets the drop on them there, knowing the layout. In the dark, he also kayoes Monk, and they come across a stunning, seemingly mute, shockingly white-haired woman.Said beauty is scared to bits by Monk, who she thinks is a 'White Beast' ape monster!To produce a fast interrogation, they try trickery, scamming the assassins with a mythological figure telling them to spill the beans. Once they do, off to the Crime College.Then it is a trip on the Helldiver, to find the mysterious Crying Rock, and on to the Phantom City.Some violence ensues, and it seems the Arab bunch were after a precious metal that exists there.Doc, being a nice guy, arms the inhabitants to give them more of a chance against the White Beast monsters."

5,Tiger Claw Gung-Fu,"This DVD is of excellent quality, what is shown here is very good as far as showing the form's application, techniques, various speeds of excution, etc.Recommended for those who are serious about understanding this unique art which has stood the test of time. Kudos for Master Tak Eng & Students."
4,its a good book,"this is my 16 year old son's review. he loves history and really enjoys this series of books.His review:i found the book to be slow in the beginning and it stays stagnant yet interesting though out much of the book.however, things get really exciting in the end."
5,great,i'm a big fan of Turtledove's Great war series and now I'm enjoying watching the rise of jake Featherson I can't wait to see what happens in this series
5,I really enjoyed this book,"This is a good book. It is a little slow in quite of few places but this book is not about war. It is about what is happpening in the USA, CSA and a little about the world. I wish Mr Turtledove did cover the war in Mexico a little more. This book goes more into the people then into battles. I think that this will help with the next book. There is alot of people in this book with hate so I believe the next book will have the begins of a war. WWII? We will have to wait and see."
4,Adolf Hitler,"I've read many of the reviews here, and to be honest I'm only about a third of the way through the book right now (got it for Christmas). The author Turtledove shows a great knowledge of how people from history MIGHT have been if things went differntly. For instance, I notice that no-one here noticed Adolf Hitler's entrance to the series. Did they???? It was a little hard to spot, though I was looking for it. Always thought Anne Colleton might have been paid a visit by a 'German artist', but since Adolf couldn;t make a name of himeslef doing that BEFORE the Great War, he wouldn't be doing that now. So. Where is old Adolf??? Here's a hint, look at page 170 in the novel."
3,Could have been better...,"I've been following the Great War series since the first book, and I have to say, I wish now that I had waited and bought the paperbacks. The Center Cannot Hold seemed to be almost perfunctory, like Turtledove is filling in the interwar peace period so he can get back to writing about war, which he is much better at.I had hoped for some originality in this book, but I was dissapointed. I have serious issues with the plausibility of some of the events in the book, it seems like he is just taking history from our world and inserting an extra country (the CSA).I had also hoped to see more depth in the characters, but I was dissapointed in that as well. Being from Richmond, I found some of the scenes here interesting in a macabre sort of way, but I felt he could have used more detail."
3,Good Not Great,"This book is very much the middle of the series, and though it has the usual strength of Turtledove it has some flaws. The majority of the viewpoint characters are excellent, especially if one has seens them change over 5 books. That being said some don't do a lot and seem to be waiting for the forthcoming The Victorious Opposition.The history itself is well done, with amusing and chilling parallels to real history-with the disadvantage that it limits creativity. The war with Japan is a letdown, and the book can ramble, butThe Center Cannot Hold does its job: It sets up the next book and the forthcoming ""Great War II"" series, and it continues to evoke the reader's emotions positive or negative towards Harry's excellent cast of characters.The other flaw is one of editing, Harry slips on some minor details in the novel that show that this may be a bit rushed. The commercial stresses on Turtledove are hurting him, but its a gripping read, and the third in the series will be interesting."
3,Good but dont start with this series,"Over all a good follow up to the world war series , but as others have said before me , not a good first Turtledove novel. I would start with something else like The Two Georges, or Colonization series"
5,The Center Cannot Hold- I Can't Wait For The Next One!,It was really good book. The storyline was really interesting and made me think of all the possiblilities out there and about all the choices we make in our lives.
4,a good book,"This is a very good book overall, however it just seems to mirror our true history.i.e Freedom party(Nazi). But still a very good book"
4,British History,"Hard to believe this is by the same author as The Williamsburg Series. Not a quick read but informative; arrived within days of ordering, condition as stated. Will continue to order via Amazon.com."
3,Another look at an older book,"I read this book as an early teenager back in the 1950s. At the time, I thought it was quite racy! Imagine my surprise at re reading to find that in today's terms, it seems very mild. This is the story of the life of a young man from a small town in the Midwest (who grows up to become a doctor) from the late 1800s to the early 1900s.. It portrays a view of small town bickering, busybodies, and brutality, even touching on anti-immigrant sentiment during the Great war. While this book seems quite negative in aspect, it does give a picture of that particular time frame of American life."
5,You know she looks real fine,Just to correct some of the previous claims about where this was originally released - add to the previous mentioned single B-side and Boxed Set an official Atlantic EP released only in Australia called This is Led Zeppelin (ATLANTIC EPA 220) of which I am lucky to have a copy.And as far as cover versions go add to the Hootie & Blowfish Encomium version another by Chris Thomas King on Whole Lotta Blues-This Ain't No Tribute.Definitely a must have for any serious Zep collector is this CD single replica.Fantastic song.
4,great songs,"I actually purchased this for the ""B"" side. It is a rare song that is extremely difficult to find and sounds clear as a bell on this CD....:)"
5,Led Zeppelin,"You can not rate Led Zepplin bad! They are Led Zepplin!! This among so many others is a great, great song!"
5,5 stars...for what it is!!!,"As the title says, this single is awesome for what it is. It's a mini-lp-style cd 45"".It's great!!"
5,I finally found: Hey hey what can I do.,"I was not about to buy the box set because I have all of their studio recordings. I was really excited to find that the song existed on such a cheap CD. This is by far their best B-side, and it is right up there with their best songs."
3,Why wasn't this B-Side on an album?,"Dear Evree Won,I think that the only other band to have such a great amount of material released where you are better off getting all their albums instead of a greatest hits package was the Beatles.I've heard ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"" on the radio many times and it is a great song. I can't figure out why this wasn't on LED ZEPPELIN III. This song is so much better than ""Hats Off To (Roy) Harper"". It would have fit so perfectly at that spot. Also the weird thing is that it's only found on this CD-single and the expensive (if you already have all their albums) COMPLETE STUDIO RECOIRDING. It should have been put on a greatest hits CD just to make this song a little bit more available.The least you could do is smile, PaulQ"
3,Color coded,"My dissatisfaction with this product lies with the color. By no means is this color ""aubergine""; ""cerise"" or ""berry"", but not ""aubergine"" which is the color of eggplant, no? You could be more specific as to color in the future.That is the only regret I have about this product, otherwise it is a lovely, soft cashmere.Beatrice Parides"
2,"Very flimsy, mediocre quality","Not the most impressive turtleneck out there, the fabric is somewhat soft but more akin to wool than cashmere to the touch and to the eye."
2,I returned the sweater,"It may be cashmere, but it's very very light -- and if you are looking for more ""standard"" cashmere - (I have several cashmere sweaters and this one is much much lighter than any) -- also, I found the sizing small.I bought the large and I would have kept it for my daughter, who wears a small, had it been a bit ""heavier"" ...But maybe it's good for warm climates????"
2,Thinner and Smaller than I thought,"Although the price was right, and the cashmere was of good quality. I thought the sweater was very thin in material, not as thick as other cashmeres I have purchased. I ordered a large and it was very tight. I ended up returning the sweater and buying a cashmere scarf - which I love!"
5,This First? YES!!,"My friends were shocked that ""Pero Me Acuerdo De Ti"" made first single off of Christina's last album, but to me, it came naturally. Christina's vocals are OUTSTANDING in this song, the light operetta-ish high notes, the deep, soul-stirring lyrics, and the feeling that only Christina can deliver in each and every one of her songs. There are a few remixes, but I honestly can't pick a favorite. The dance, the techno, the funky hip-hop. They all rock! If you're looking for REAL talent in the Latin Pop world, Christina is the only act worth investigating."
1,Worst Mic I've Ever Purchased,"When I pulled this thing out of the box, I felt like I was taking out a cheap plastic toy from a McDonald's kid's meal. It just looked pathetic. I was greeted with disappointment yet again when I actually hooked it up and tried using the thing. The audio was abysmal. Literally hours later, anything it recorded would be backed by grating static and noise. Unbelievably bad."
1,STRAIGHT WHACK!,This is a wast of all yall cash. Quik has been holding it down for minute but he let's the ball drop on this one. Save your money!
5,WESTCOAST GREAT,I have been a DJ Quik fan since forever and everything he does is hott. This album is no different it's just a collection of his best work wich basically makes it a masterpiece. Hot beats and lyrics it's a must have for quik fans. Every song is hot on this album and Quik will always be one of Westcoasts Elite.
5,Midler's first is a classic!,"Bette Midler's first album is a classic. This album is excellent! It consists of mostly of covers including Do You Want To Dance, Chapel of Love, Superstar, Leader of the Pack, and Delta Dawn. Midler puts her classic touch on each one, making Do You Want To Dance a ballad instead of a dance tune, Leader of the Pack has more of a rock touch than the original, Delta Dawn is more inspiring than the original, and Superstar will bring you tears as only Midler can. This album also contains Bette's top 10 smash, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, her classic Friends, and the saddening ballad Hello In There. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! If you love this Bette album, you'll love these other Bette albums: Bette Midler, Broken Blossom, Thighs and Whispers. Support Bette Midler! Buy the album here! Don't buy from an auction or download the songs for free!"
4,Energy,"How could I NOT love this woman? Her music radiates the energy of a person invested in living, and acting on her environment."
2,"Heavy going, overly self-indulgent","I expected to find this interesting, and didn't. Nancy Friday injects far, far too many of her own experiences and attitudes, and expects them to be the norm. She seems to believe that many of the ""Good Girl Rules"" still apply, citing the fact that most men still hope to marry virgins, etc. Riiiight, and most women would like to marry a millionaire. Ask the British Royal Family about the availability of virgin brides! Any mother of a teenaged boy can tell you, adolescent girls today are often avid, relentless pursuers, and sex with them is pretty much a given, not a mere possibility. Their mothers can be pushy and enthusiastic co-conspirators. There's no social penalty! The world has moved on, however much we may bemoan the fact. This book doesn't ring true for parents who find themselves in the trenches, or for people who know why the latest scandal has become a huge yawn to the general public."
4,Interesting book,"I found this book to be very thought-provoking. Nancy Friday's views on beauty and sexuality carry a very strong argument. I agree that there are moments where she's almost behind the times...I think there are a lot more women who appreciate masculine beauty than she gives credit for...but I also think that she nails a lot of things right in the head. For example, her theories on male aggression (especially in younger pop culture) are stronger than most. Although Friday does tend to dwell too much on her own experiences (which aren't as interesting as the ideas that follow), the time I invested in this book was worthwhile...if for nothing else, interesting conversation topics!"
5,A Slave to Beauty,I enjoy Nancy Friday's perspective on things but it seems that this book is reflective of a yearning to be externally acknowledged. Better off reading Transcendent Beauty by Crystal Andrus.
3,Personal and thought provoking,"I liked this book because it was a personal inquiry into Nancy Friday's own past. It included a lot of theoretical perspectives, but these weren't introduced as fact.As a man, I found a lot of food for thought between the covers of this book. However, I certainly didn't agree with everything Nancy Friday had to say.If you are exploring your orientation toward looks, beauty or want to understand some of the challenges of this area, I recommend this book. It is a deep personal share that raises excellent questions about this important area of life."
3,"Not Really Toys, Per Say","I have a different batch of SD Mini Defenders, but this can be said about any set: each figure is about 1.5 inches tall or less, and each bears 3 points of articulation (movement). And some figures come with removable assessories. Also, many 5-packs feature Gundam characters you wouldn't find anywhere else. Though I like 'em, they're not really toys, but more like little knick-knacks to have on a shelf or something. If you want something better, try SD Gundam action figures or Mini Defender playsets instead."
4,DODG a pleasant suprise,"I bought the movie expecting a mediocre performance. What I ended up with was a great dance show from Colin and Jean. When it started, I half expected the show to be a cheap rip-off of Riverdance, but it's quite original in what it does. A tiny bit cheesy at times, but what dance show isn't? The beginning was a little bit of a Riverdance rip-off, but the rest made up for the beginning. The steps are intricate and compleltey original. DODG is a show to fall in love with over and over again."
4,5 stars! An Irish Dancer's Review,"As an Irish Dancer myself who won first at the regional dance drama competition last year, I have been to numerous perfomances competitions and have seen nearly every Irish dance performance on video/DVD. To me what is so spectacular about this show is simply the choreography. The dancing is the highest of quality with world champion dancers. It is also extremely passionet with spectacular acting. The style is new and loose. The choreography has some new types of fun things like dancing while doing push ups and dancing in a pub like seen and much more. And last but not least the story is very interesting to watch. Just becuse the outfits and stage lighting aren't super glitsy and flashy like Lord of The Dance, doesn't mean that it isn't exciting. The dancing is absolutly perfected and more intricate than almost any show Irish show I've ever see. Oh yeah did I mention how good and unique the music style is!"
4,celtic dance,"wonderfull,loved it,love Jean butler in everything she does,superb,if you love celtic dance you will love this dvd."
3,Patchy,"First of all, no one can complain about the story. It's an Irish legend. The costumes sucked until the intoxication dance (my favorite). The beginning and ending songs were REALLY good too. The rest of the show was mediocre and not worth watching, even for the feet. Rent this show if possible, or watch it when it comes on TV. If you feel that you must purchase it based on the integrity of a few dances, try to get a used copy."
3,Irish Dancing,"Colin Dunne is definitely NOT Michael Flatley. In fact, he is ""flat"" as the prototype lover in this re-creation of an old Irish legend. His surly expression dominates his role even in romantic segments and his dancing lacks ""pizazz"", for a better word. Jean Butler does not disappoint; she is charming and talented. And, the music and the instrumentalists are excellent. The ensemble is large, adequately costumed, and proficient. If you enjoy the art of dancing, this will satisfy. Frankly, I enjoyed Tony Kemp as Finn McCool as much as anybody.....and he did not dance a step. Some of the segments to the story were too drawn out. I am not surprised the production failed. Riverdance was superb......this is not. I wish I had bought a used copy instead of paying full price. Oh, well, live and learn."
2,You've Got To Be Kidding,"After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue. It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG. You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens. The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz. No wonder it died financially and never reached the States."
2,"Dickies fan, but not with these.","My husband doesn't like faded colored jeans and all he wears are Dickies. The color was great, but they were too short. He is 6'0 and the shorts were about 1.5"" above his knees, so I ended up returning these. If you like your jeans to be all one color, darker, and if you happen to be shorter than 6'0 tall, then these would probably work for you."
5,If you love BD you'll love this.,"This is the special that aired on PBS some years ago. Lots of video (Bandstand, etc.) interviews with people who knew him well, and tastefully done. Wish someone would release his last shows as a set."
5,Another Fine Spillane Tale,"A previously published novelette from 1954.It has all the hallmarks of a Spillane tale. The tough guy hero that gets pushed around. Until he wants it to stop.Quite enjoyed this tale of young Joe Boyle assailed from all sides. Two groups of mobsters want him, the cops want him, and all to learn the identity of a killer named Vetter, in town to take out somebody. Joe had delivered the message to one hood and no one believed he didn't know the killer.There's also a woman that Joe has fallen for, and she with him, that's being threatened.Spillane is a long time favorite writer and I don't understand why so many don't like his writing. I have a few friends that fall into that category. Just don't get it.Recommended."
2,Everybody's Watching Me. Amazon e-book,"I used to really enjoy Mickey Spillane books and hadn't read one for AGES, Don't know what it was but I found this book to be flat, not at all how I remember the M. Spillane books. I personally was disappointed in this one, but then this is just my opinion others may well disagree.."
5,"If you like anime, you'll enjoy this","The movie fell right into the tv series. The characters didn't change, the voices did so you could hear it instead of reading sub titles. It's worth the money.The shipping was reasonable and quick."
1,Casa de bad,"I love Will Ferrel,think he is a very talented comdedian,usually ""get"" his humor.I felt like could see what he was trying to do with this movie,but it was just bad,not funny. Mostly bored, embarrassed I so eagerly wanted to rent it to watch with others.Maybe if I was a huge fan of Spanish movies or even someone who watched a couple it would be more funny to me,but even getting the point of the movie it was BAD.Think he was terribly stoned to not only think this movie was a good idea,but to act in it."
1,Horrible!!!,"Horrible, boring, waste of money. I wish I had read the reviews that warn that it's all in Spanish. You shouldn't have to pay that close attention with a comedy."
1,Not worth it,"I rented for $5 and very displeased with the movie. Maybe if it were $1.99 then id say its worth at least watching. This movie doesnt come close to anchor man, old school, blades of glory, taladega nights, nothin. Watch youtube. Im sure you will see the 3 funny scenes there"
2,Not worth the money & I only paid $2.99,"I never finished watching it. Got about a third of the way through it and decided that it wasn't worth trying to read the english subtitles (it's all in spanish) because it wasn't funny enough and kinda boring. It may have gotten better, but I decided to rent something else instead. I like Will Ferrell most of the time, but not in this one."
4,THIS IS MY LAND,"First the disclaimer: I love Will Farrell films. I hate the scenes that have Will Farrell in them.This movie is a spoof of Mexican films. It involves drug dealers, ranchers, and a girl. The plot is immaterial. The fun aspect of the film is the fake sets, fake animals, fake special effects, bad editing and bad acting. This is all done by design. It would have been more realistic if we saw a boom mic lowered into the shot every now and then with a director yelling.Because I didn't have to listen to Will Farrell in English, for some reason his lines were funnier and I was able to tolerate him. Make no mistake, this is a film for bad movie lovers. If you don't love bad movies, i.e. not a fan of MST 3000 don't bother with this film. Great film for Asylum lovers.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex? rear nudity. Only 4 stars. It still had Will Farrell in it."
3,A Little Thin,There is something about having to read subtitles that interferes with the laughs. They did the impossible job of mocking the Mexican drug war and all movie shootouts in a silly but insightful way. I gave it an extra star just for the robotic white tiger.
2,fooled me once,"If I could get my money and the time back that I waisted on this load of crap from Will Farrel, I would. Once I got over the fact that it was a spanish language move from an actor who speaks english as a first language. The acting was less than bad and the story line was even worse. Rocky"
3,Don't tell Will I betrayed him...,"I hate to do this because I love Will Ferrell. I have almost all of his movies on DVD and have watched all of them over and over. As a matter of fact, his movies are the only ones I can really do that with. But for me, this movie was just a little better than Semi-Pro (which was pretty lame.) This movie at least had some really funny moments tucked in there but it just didn't keep my attention. And I always enjoy the so-bad-its-good moments like the ridiculous white cat sequence. Id say its worth a watch if you're a hardcore Ferrell fan like me... but otherwise you'll be left feeling confused and wishing you had saved your pennies for Starbucks.I love you Will, but this wasn't your best."
2,"Few laughs, but mostly mediocre","I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but I was disappointed in this movie. It has a few laughs, but it was mostly mediocre. I will say Will Ferrell's Spanish was pretty good and he has the Mexican accent down very well, though. But otherwise, it falls short as the humorous comedy I was hoping it would be."
2,Casa De Mi Padre,"I can not believe that Will Ferrell did this movie. It was by far his worst movie EVER. The story line was bad, the acting was bad and there was not any real humor. I do not speak spanish but, some of the words did not match the subtitles.I sure wish that I could get my money back that I paid to rent this. I sure hope this is not a sign of what is to come from Will Ferrell."
3,"Big Will Ferrell fan, slightly disappointed","I have to say I love Will Ferrell, and tend to like his movies. But this has to be his worst one yet. I am all for stupid comedies, but this was is kind of dully stupid. The trailer for it basically has all the funniest bits from the movie in it, aside from those scenes the rest is kind of boring, maybe a light chuckle here or there. Its not a terrible movie, but just ok. Don't pay much to watch it, and don't expect a whole lot."
3,FERRRRREL A LA MEXICANA!!,"I can't belive this guy!! He almost fool me SPEAKING MEXICANO! I'm mexican born and raise there y yo no habra americano, so I undestood every word he said. Ferrel always deliver and this movie was no exeption. Stupid plot like any soap opera with a messege at the end. Good stuff Ferrel!!"
3,Enjoyable but Very Corny!,I would compare Case De Mi Padre to Blazing Saddles. Funny but also very campy. Probably wouldn't watch again. Very funny take-off to Spanish Telenovelas.
4,Hmmmmmm,Can't say if it's a well made film or not but I thought it was entertaining and I am very well known for my terrible taste and run on sentences
4,He took a big risk and it mostly pays off,"I picked this up on faith as I've really been enjoying his work lately. I went into it not knowing what to expect and I had a great time. This is a loving sendup of Spanish language westerns and telenovelas, so if that sounds like something you'd enjoy I pretty much guarantee you'll like this. For those fluent in Spanish, or even with a little knowledge, you'll get a lot of laughs out of how simplistic much of the dialogue is as well. Its technically correct but its so stilted you'll be cracking up. Its uneven, to be sure, but where it hits it hits hard."
1,"Casa de mi Oafish ""Gringo""","Despite Farrell's best attempts, a convincing Mexican he is not. Will Farrell spoke Spanish like he was reading from a Spanish 101 grade school text. Who was this movie meant to fool?"
3,Casa De Mi Padre,"The movie streamed really well, we did not have any problems with it. The only issue was the subtitles. They were in white so it kept being washed out throughout certain scenes."
2,Seemed funny- if you could read the subtitles!!,"My husband and I LOVE Will Ferrell! We're big fans of dumb comedy, so this seemed right up our ally! The movie seemed funny, but we were seriously disappointed that the subtitles were small and in white text- you literally could not read what they were saying (we have good eye-sight and a good tv, so that isn't a factor)! I was getting a headache trying to read the white text against the bright scenes, so we had to cut it off. It was definitely not worth the rental fee. We'd be glad to try watching it again if the text were to be updated!"
1,disappointed in every way,"I was hesitant but thought with Will Ferrell, it would be worth a try. Wrong. So very wrong. The previews made it seem like it was funny. It just isn't and life is too short to waste time watching this movie."
1,awful movie,"Casa De Mi Padre movie is not funny, actors are not professional, feels very long, the prop jokes are not funny."
2,"Too dry for me. But, my husband...","Too dry for me. But my husband stuck it out, watched the ENTIRE movie and informed me that there were some very witty and sometimes very funny things in the movie."
1,Wish I could get my time and $$ back,"People save your money...don't bother!Wish, I could get my time and $$ back! If you're really bored like I was and thats the only reason I opted to watch this go for a walk you'll be better off."
1,"not funny, waste of time","I agree, I wish I could have my time and money back. Dialogue was lacking any wit or humor! Not the typical Will Ferrell movie."
1,Another epic fail only Will Ferrell could deliver,"I didn't purchase this movie and can not understand why anyone would even consider it. My father rented it the other night and I happened to be visiting. This was easily one of the worst movies ever made, this is even for the likes of Will Ferrell who has very few good performances.For those who have yet to see this film be prepared to watch for when the real horses that were in one shot become stick horses that glide along the screen as if they were floating on air. Low budget, low quality, poor acting. Fans of Anchorman will likely enjoy this slow and empty movie that will bore to death anyone not so entertained by this level of acting or script."
4,There should be more movies like this,"This movie is a work of art, and does everything art is supposed to do, including to make you wonder why it was even made. It spoofs the ""common gringo idea"" of what a Spanish film is like, particularly if it is from Latin America. It is controversial and makes important social statements. It is not meant to be 100% funny. Will Ferrell wants you to wake up. People in the United States often refer to themselves as ""American,"" but we are all Americans amigos. It's time for all the babies to grow up and live in the real world. I love the song ""Yo No Se."""
2,Boring movie,"I thought the movie was going to be interesting and fun because of the cast. However, it was boring with no good story or funny situations.Don't waste your time watching it."
2,I Guess I Just Didn't Get It,"I applaud Will Farrell for making the movie. It's a bold choice. But the premise of sending up Mexican TV and movies stopped being funny about 15 minutes into the movie. Making fun of poor production values, acting and music got very stale very fast. There's just not that much to recommend the movie.On a happier note, Genesis Rodriquez is clearly a talented actress, and I expect we'll be seeing much more of her in the future.Beyond that....meh."
3,Why does Will always have to show tushy!?!,"Other than having to see Will Ferrell's tush (although not surprised seeing as how he shows it in just about every movie), it wasn't too bad of a movie. Go in expecting it to be silly and you won't be disappointed. If you're not a Ferrell fan however, don't bother."
3,It's... funny?,"Well - Not sure what I expected with a Spanish speaking Will Ferrell. It's not a bad movie. I'm not sure what to really thing. Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor and satire, but so subtle and brushed over that the comedy of it is kind of missed."
3,Great Actors-Poor Movie,"This movie had some of the best Spanish actors. It could have been a great movie, instead it's just a huge dissapointment!"
1,Baddddddd!,Total disapointment i rented it and it sucksPlease dont rent it dont make same mistake i did i thought it was good too...
3,Funny at times.,"In a parody of old Spanish westerns, Will Ferrell stars in an all Spanish-speaking role as a Mexican man whose family is involved with local drug dealers. He takes on the bad guys and seeks to save the life of a beautiful woman in the process. Some scenes in the film were intentionally done in a manner to appear to be amateurish to emulate a low-budget production, and these scenes are good for a few laughs. The movie was not done as a non-stop laugh parody, but is actually played straight more so than expected. I would have liked the movie to be a bit zanier and a clear attempt to parody the genre, but perhaps this would have tread into the territory of silliness. Overall, the movie was okay, and is worth seeing."
2,"It totally sucks, don't hate, but don't care either.","It was too stupid, and I speak Spanish! I expected funny, but it probably would have been better if done in English. The Spanish just got in the way."
1,OMG - Run from this don't walk,OMG - I wish I could give this movie NO stars. It has to be the worst Will Ferrell movie ever. I would say it is the worst I have ever seen but I could not make it past the first 20 minutes. I fast forwarded to middle and end. It was not any better. I have seen ever Will Ferrel movie made except this one. I can't believe he starred is such a bad film. Don't walk but run from this movie.
1,So bad that it made me write my first review ever,"I know that Will Ferrell movies are silly and funny on his own way but this one just wasn't funny. I'm fluent in both, English and Spanish, so it has nothing to do with the fact that the movie was in another language.Glad that it was only a couple of dollars with Amazon prime; otherwise I would have been very upset.Do yourself a favor and use your money on something else.The bottom line: Not worth it."
1,Not funny,Westerns weren't very good to begin with... Plus e subtitles are one the film itself... Not the black bars on the bottom so very hard to read and follow the story... I found it offensive to Hispanic culture
1,Worst movie ever by Will,"We think Will found a Spanish learning DVD and then made this movie. We love most of Will's movies, but this one missed the mark for us by several miles. Make sure you have seen this movie before buying."
1,casa de mi padre,"Casa de mi Padre, Lousy movie that I have seen so for. I was looking for better quality from Will but looks like a parody of mexican movies."
5,4.5 plus,"Saw this in the theater with my brother who is a Ferrell fan but really dislikes subtitles. I like foreign films but find a lot of American comedies run of the mill, predictable, cheesy, formulaic, and even boring at best. Both of us loved this movie and laughed a lot as did the others in the theater. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out it really helps if you get the whole telenovela thing. This film is funny because it pokes fun at that at that and at itself- and has the cajones to be different from the typical Hollywood laugh factory dreck. I buy few dvd's because I am not a big enough fan of most movies to watch them again and again. For some reason, this movie, like a Raising Arizona, Juno or other quirky films has that special something and funny moments like the guys laughing around the fire that would make me want to see it again."
1,Don't waste your money,"Really bad production, do not waste your money, I watched thinking it was good but it's not, so again DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE"
2,Sometimes you get more chuckles on a second pass....,"For a comedy, I found this about 20% funny.... seriously this had so much unrealized potential... big fans of Will Ferrell will probably be quite disappointed. Old School or Ron Burgundy it is not...."
4,Well done,"This film perfectly replicates the Mexican movie director style. It was like watching their Novellas with an American cast, very entertaining"
2,Boo!,"I speak spanish and it works, but movie is way too cheesy for my liking, buy if you like corny, you'll love it."
4,Funny Mexiflick,No damage to box or movie upon arrival. Movie was great for an all spanish script. Loved how the poor quality sometimes exemplified how funny this movie is. A must see.
4,casa de mi padre,"i've always liked will farrel, i was skeptical about will speaking spanish through out the whole movie. i am amazed at how well will pulled off his spanish, the movie is kind of corny , but has some really funny moments."
3,"Out of the junkyard, and into obscurity","Here's another one of those early 90's bands that couldn't quite make it in the alternative rock world. Junkyard Angels debuted in 1994 with Out of the Junkyard, Onto the Curb. I was hoping for something along the lines of L.A. Guns (or at least Junkyard) when I ran across this album, not this laid back, bluesy bar rock vaguely reminiscent of the Black Crowes and the Bacon Brothers. Still, it's a decent, if not particularly memorable, rock album. Unfortunately for the band, you needed to pass an ""alternative test"" to make it in the Nirvana era. Too bad the name Toad the Wet Sprocket was taken. That probably would have been good enough for an MTV ""Buzz Bin"" slot and at least 15 minutes of fame.Out of the Junkyard, Onto the Curb was the band's only release. If you run across it for a dollar or two and are into this kind of music, go ahead and pick it up. I can't give it a much stronger recommendation than that though."
3,Can't sleep with this one!,"I had to return this unit, after 3 nights. I bought it for my bedroom but the fan does not go quiet enough. The unit would be ok for a game room or someplace where noise is not an issue. It definitely produces cold @ 20 degrees across the coils, which is Industry Standard. Unfortunately you can not tell which speed the fan is on, other than the pictures are still on the wall, so it must be on low. This unit has a very agressive fan unit, it will literally blow the pictures off the wall, if it is aimed correctly. There is no speed fan indicator on the unit nor the remote. The drain is a dust pan, not a drain pan. The remote is not lighted, so at night forget it. I traded this unit for an Alen C 535 which is better, but has a less aggressive fan. There is room for improvement, and I would even pay more money to get more, if it was available."
1,Never got one that worked,"Ordered one from Amazon, next day shipping. Opened box, parts fell out. Returned no issue for another one. Instead of honoring the next day shipping, Amazon shipped it ground. Seven days later, opened box, parts fell out. Returned for refund, 2 weeks later, still no refund."
5,Like Nothing Else,"If you're looking for something different, thought provoking, inventive, and fun, This is a good album to get. The trick is to listen to it a few times because the sound (or style) is weird. To my ears and soul, this is not Led-Zeppelin's weaker second term. It is completely different than anything that you can find anywhere in music. Robert Plant's love for music and dedication to finding cool new sounds is stamped on every track. You will listen to this for years and love it more every time you listen to it."
4,Burning Down All Sides!,"Burning Down One Side is worth the price of this album, all by itself. I first heard it at Hampton Beach, NH when I was in high school and everyone was rocking to it, blasting out of the Camaro ragtops grinding up and down the boulevard. ""My knees are weak, my head is reelin'"" indeed. That song is absolutely blistering. Worse than Detroit? No, it;s better than Detroit."
5,A brilliant release,"I'm going to say something that I'm sure will have me howled down by other reviewers but I gotta get it off my chest - I love this Plant album more than anything Led Zeppelin ever did!Right from the word go this album grabs hold and won't let go. Put it on in the car and just cruise down the highway safe in the knowledge there isn't a dud track anywhere.The backing musicians are great, especially Robbie Blunt, the vocals are excellent as Plant still had all the range required to bring out the best in these compositions. Going into track by track analysis is pointless, this is an awesome album. Production wise this disc doesn't sound like it was record over 20 years ago, it's still quite fresh, perhaps due to the restraint of the arrangements and the clarity and quality of the playing.If your interested in getting into Robert Plant and don't know where to start, this would be my suggestion, either this or The Principle of Moments."
3,Not A Bad Album,"This is a pretty decent collection of songs. Not all of them are my taste, but most are worth a listen. ""Moonlight in Samosa,"" is a good tune and so is ""Slowdancer,"" and ""Burning Down One Side."" ""Worse than Detroit,"" is my least favorite. Too bluesy for me, but for fans of blues music, they'll probably like it. I like the way the synths are included in most of the album. This album has its moments."
1,oldies but goodies,"i was very disappointed in this cd, when it was recorded, it sounded like sunny was drunk. the song lyrics didnt match up with or kept up with the instrumentation-- tooooo much delay in hitting the lyrics properly. i think he was trying to copy the frank sinatra-dean martin style of delaying the lyrics. this may have worked for them sunny- but not for you, especially in these classics! dont buy this one- its a waste, i got so upset that i threw it out the window of my car!!!"
2,"sunny""s gold",The cd was not in good format. Not as good as the original recordings. But it was a good attempt
4,Nice Little Read,"I recently read this book. I dont read much Science Fiction and Fantasy, but this author does have a nice way of putting the words on paper. I enjoyed it...a little bit of something here for everybody."
4,REVIEW,The book Chipper written by James Lincoln Collier is about an eleven year old boy called Chipper. But when Chipper was six his mom died because of consumption and he never had a father. After Chipper's mom died he went to live with his uncle and aunt. His uncle would always beat him for no reason until one day Chipper decided to run away. Then when Chipper turned ten he decided to join a gang. The gang is called the Midnight Rats. From there on he has to overcome his problems and try to survive.
5,Fantastic!,My DVD players suddenly started getting finicky. They worked with or DVDs but were having trouble playing new ones. They would sometimes not read the DVDs. I ordered this and now both players work fantastically well.
1,little laser late,"If your already experiencing trouble with your disks, it's probably to late to buy this product. Far more is it useful as a preventative measure, for my drive stopped working completely after the first ""cleaning"" and didn't come back till I'd backed up everything, disassembled my drive, and cleaned the thing by hand myself. Keep your nose clean and your computer cleaner."
3,"Fragial, but what do you expect for $3.89","I use these cleaning discs as desposable solutions to keeping a drive in good shape. The brushes are flimsy and fragial, and wear out in about four months, then I toss the disc, buy a new one, and am left with a free jewel case. The directions aren't real clear, hense three stars rather than four, but the price is right, and when you toss them in with large orders, you can't beat it."
5,dvd head cleaner,"received dvd cleaner and tried it and it worked real well. i would reommend this to my friends. your account seller was very prompt and courteous, would definately order from them again."
5,Scotch Laser Lens Cleaner,"I love watching movies. Pause if you need to and no annoying commercials. Started having problems with picture freezing up. I ran this through once and so far it's worked. Good product, good price."
5,It's a CD/DVD Cleaner....give me a break,This is exactly what the title says it is. A disc that cleans CD/DVD drives. The scotch name is the best in its genre. Gamble the $4. You won't be disappointed.
4,Scotch Laser Lens Cleaner,Item worked as promised.Issues I had with new DVD's skipping stopped immediately.
3,Nothing to brag about,It did a okay job but nothing impressive. I think that I could have done better with a little old fashion cleaning of alchol and cotton balls.
2,Cleans Audio Laser Not DVD Laser,"This cleaner effectively cleaned the audio laser in my player. However, it could not reach both sides of the video laser reader."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,i PURCHASED FOR 2 REASONS:tO STOP SKIPPING -- dvd'SAND TO SEE IF IT WOULD HELP MAKE MY lASER dvd PLAYER FUNCTION AGAIN WITH BURNING ISSUES.fAILED!!TRY SOMETHING ELSESAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,Disappointed,It does not explain that this is two items at the cost of $ 3.99 each. I thought I was purchasing one item for $ 3.99.
4,Great deal - Good book.,"I purchased this collected works of Voltaire a couple of years ago and quite enjoyed it. However, I did read an older translation of Candide from a used book-store a couple of years earlier and I found that some of the irony and overall tone was communicated better. That said, there really isn't anything terrible wrong with this translation and, of course, it's a great deal; you get all of these works in one book. I think mine cost $5 U.S. I recommend this book, each individual story would cost you at least 5 dollars."
1,Myopic View of the War in Viet Nam,"Unfortunately this is another myopic book about the &#65533;Vietnam War,&#65533; that would have you believe the US fought alone in Viet Nam.Both the design and content are seriously lacking for the intended audience, grades 7+. Important facts are left out while other facts are pathetically incorrect; most captions are mislabeled, and many &#65533;documents&#65533; are indistinguishable from the narrative text. Sadly, even in 2003 it appears America still has Post Traumatic Stress Denial with parts of our own history."
4,berlitz mandarin Pocket dictionary,"I bought dictionary i live in Jamaica it has many regular words and that is great but needs to have words like Jamaican,reggae and rastafarian.I would recommend to anyone learning mandarin using the pinyin."
4,So helpful! Easy to carry everywhere every day.,"We moved to China for a few months. My husband and I each carried one of these dictionaries with us the entire time. It's easy to use and is nice having the Chinese words in Pinyin. I loved that the cover is vinyl/plastic. A paper cover would have been destroyed with our constant use. My only gripe is that it didn't include some simple words that we would have liked to use, but it obviously couldn't include everything and be small enough to carry everywhere. I would highly recommend this book."
1,This is not an LTO Ultrium Cleaning Cartridge,This is not the product that is described on line. The product described is a cleaning tape for a back up drive for a computer server (which cannot be cleaned with carpet cleaner). We returned the carpet cleaner and can no longer purchase the Ultrium Cleaning Cartridges at the advertised price. We will never shop with Amazon again.
5,The master of the macabre!,"This is a very well written book. Castle is a master storyteller. Not just of the macabre but all things in film. This being said he can play a little fast and loose with certain details, such as his exchanges with Joan Crawford. His version differs quite a bit from the writer Robert Blochs (of Psycho and Straightjacket fame ) in their dealings with Miss Crawford. Nevertheless, this is a fun read that you will enjoy immensely."
5,no small miracles,Absolutely loved this book. I've read it several times and have let some of my friends to read it too.
2,'Bark' a Lot of Noise,"Bark, the musical is at first cute and entertaining, however the gloss wears thin quickly. Then you realize that you're listening to a mediocre cast album that doesn't hold up well over time. Not a good investment for your Original Cast album collection"
3,Buy an inner-tube,"Seems to be of good quality. But my daughters wanted a inner tube to sled here in Alaska, and I should have bought one....Amazon has them for [...]. This isn't providing [...] worth of extra fun. Still, it's made in France, and I wanted to support the last guy in France actually working."
2,only works on ice,This is a really nice sled but so far we can't get it to work. I guess it only works on ice and maybe a steep hill with fresh powder.
3,It worked . . . but not for me,"The alarm clock worked like it should have. Size was good, big buttons were good and I liked being able to dim my light and set it to go on and off. However, I'm a heavy sleeper. Sunlight doesn't wake me, so this little light definitely didn't. And I HATED the sound of the alarm clock. For me, it was basically a really expensive alarm clock with another annoying alarm sound. I'm returning it."
4,Sunrise Alarm Clock,"Morning Sunrise System Dawn Dusk Sun Alarm Clock SRS100USI have to admit - this wasn't the easiest thing to figure out. But once I did I love it. It works so well that I get up, shower and get dressed and when I bring my dog downstairs to let her outside I am always surprised that it is still dark outside. It definitely needs a longer cord so I am going hunt for a 3-prong cord to enable me to put it in a better location. Highly recommend this product!"
3,Flawed design: Light doesn't stay on!,"I like it alot and like being able to use my own lamp. However, there's one big drawback: after the light fades up to its maximum, it begins to fade down again right away. I think this is a considerable design flaw. The first morning I used it, I saw the light at its brightest, closed my eyes for a couple minutes, and when I opened them again, the room was completely dark again. I wrote to the company and was told I need to press the alarm button once to keep it on. My clock and lamp are across the room, so this isn't too convenient for me. It would seem that since its purpose is to wake you up by simulating the sun rising, it ought to stay on like the sun."
2,Shoddy Construction,"I have owned two of these this year, the first was bad when it arrived this February, the lights would flicker and wouldn't dim properly. Touching the front of the clock would cause the lights to change brightness randomly without ever touching the buttons. I returned it for a replacement, and that one worked fine up until the bulb burned out in the lamp it was controlling, after that it would flicker similar to the other one, and wouldn't dim all the way. This is a great idea, and when they come out with one that works better I will buy one. Until then it looks like I'm out of luck."
4,Please Use it WIth a Surge Preventer,"I have been using this for 3 or 4 years, and I really like it except for a few things. The cord is so bulky it's hard to make it sit flat on a table, and I wish the alarm volume was adjustable.The fatal error, though, is that when our power went out a month or so ago, the volume quit working. That was okay, because I seem to have trained myself to wake up with the light by itself. However, the power went out again last week and fried the display, so now it is unusable. I will replace this clock with another sunrise model, but I recommend plugging it in through a surge protector."
4,Sunrise Clock,"After initial problems of the light flickering, which resolved itself after I used a different plug socket, the product has worked perfectly.Excellent having 7 days alarms although it does take a while to flick through them all to modify one.The item is quite big for the functions it performs but it works well."
2,not reliable,"I really enjoy this product when it works, but it is not reliable. I use it with a regular alarm clock on the side because I like to wake up to music. It is a good thing that I do because I would have missed work several times if I relied on this dawn simulator alone. Also, it is very confusing and complicated to program. I would not recommend it."
5,Grandma Marian's Experience with MY Lilly,"This past Monday I went to baby-sit my granddaughter, Lilly, who will be three in August. Very recently, her father bought her the book. I wanted to read it. MY Lilly said, ""NO!"" Every time I asked to read the book, I received the same answer. Finally, when her mom came home, I was able to read the book.I LOVE this book!!! Every little girl should have their own copy. The Lilly in this story shows how to deal with a big disappointment in her life. The ending is so endearing!Now I need to ask the pediatrician, who was on a radio talk show Thursday answering a question about what to do when your child does not want to share a toy with another visiting child, for advice. (His advice: The toy is brought back to his room.) I wonder what advice Dr. Contini has for me, Grandma Marian!Marian DevincenziP.S. Mr. Henkes, I am originally from Columbus, Wisconsin. It is so great to have an outstanding children's author from Wisconsin!"
1,Not what I expected.,"I bought this book becourse I read ""Inside Solidworks"" from David Murray which i liked a lot.This book was not what I expected. The backcover says: beginner:yes, intermediate:yes, advanced:yes. To my opinion it only provides beginners information. But for a beginner it may be hard to understand in the way it's given.A lot of pages only cover tables with descriptions of commands accompanied with a half-page-high screenshot of Catia (version 4.1.6? for unix?) for those commands. The examples are very basic with no ""inside""-tricks or tips.I am pretty new to Catia so it's hard to judge what the difference is between unix-Catia4.1.6 and the current windows-Catia5.4 but if i look in the book and on the screen the book looks very outdated.This book reminded me of some books a read about autocad 9 or 10 years ago. Nowadays I think u may expect more then a summary of commands and poor examples from a not so cheap book."
3,Inside Catia-How Do I Get Out?,"Very detailed book about a very complex CAD program. I was very disappointed with the way the index was done. For instance, if I wanted to know how to ROTATE some geometry, there is nothing in the index that refers me to the correct command, which is TRANSFORM. The same applies to COPY. The index should refer the reader to the correct command based on a description of the action that you want to apply. Another example would be if I wanted to MOVE some text, geometry, etc. There should be a MOVE entry in the index that refers me to the command that moves whatever it is I'm trying to move. CATIA's menu structure is very convoluted. Not being able to look in the index for what should be basic commands in any other CAD program was extremely frustrating and time consuming. Unfortunately, the choices are few as far as CATIA guides are concerned. This book is a fair attempt at simplifying a very complex CAD program."
1,Save your money,"This book is VERY elementary. Only suitable for beginners, not for those with any experience. Lots of functions missing."
1,Disappointment,"While searching for a book for my book club selection, I came across this book heralded by its readers as a wonderful but fun example of current southern literature. Our book club has focused on southern authors, so this seemed to be a natural. I suggested it as a December selection. Knowing that we would all be busy during the Christmas season, this would be excellent reading. WRONG!! What a waste of time!!! It was not funny; it was shallow, trite, predictable, and disapponting. We couldn't even discuss it. Probably suitable for a very young teenager."
5,The Town That Came A-Cortin' was GREAT!,Such a cute book. I felt like I was in the south reading this book. The way she describes people and places really makes you feel like you are part of the story. It was a wonderful read and I can't wait for the movie to come out.
2,"Just a little bit too sweet and predictable,","While I enjoy southern writers and knew it was going to be a light read, it was way too sweet and too predictable for me. I even was rolling my eyes in a few places. I am from the south, but I still found the southern parts to be way too over the top for my liking. Everyone and everything was ""perfect"". It was a little bit like Stepford town. The book had amusing moments and I really liked the idea of a towns people coming together as a matchmaker, but all and all, I found myself impatient to finish it because I just couldn't get it to hold my interest."
1,Mystical,"This book places a great deal of emphasis on spirituality and/or mysticism. I found it rather unscientific and while it did offer a few insights, overall it was not worth the time spent reading it."
3,Mounting hardware kit,"It took a very long time to receive this kit, even though I paid immediatly. Very slow shipping!!!"
3,"Not a bad case for a smaller than 9"" player","A 9"" player barely fits with no room at all. The pocket is simply not big enough for the power cord, headphones, and remote. I struggle to get the zipper closed and the seams are bulging. I think no bigger than a 7"" player would be best. I'm buying the 10"" bag for the extra space."
4,Good Quality,The quality is great! I just wish it had more room to store DVDs. Currently I'm only able to fit some cords and the DVD player.
3,"""cumple""",El maletin cumple bien su cometido pero el material parece de baja calidad por lo que desmerece a la marca Case Logic no es un producto que me gustaria recomendar
4,Protective and useful for dvd plus extras,I purchased this to use while traveling (car and plane) I mainly used it for grandson (5 yrs) and it has worked to keep the dvd player protected and we used it in the car with the included strap for back of seat. It had enough room for the headphones I purchased separately and the car charger (also bought separately) I liked having a place for these items to all belong. My grandson is able to put away the items by himself. Happy with this product.
5,Great Value,I looked at other products and cases but found this case perfect for my portable DVD player at a great price.
2,Beware....this won't work in full sized van,"Got this case for an upcoming trip to hold our Panasonic LS86 8.5"" dvd player. The case itself is well made and offers plenty of padding and protection although the fit was a little loose for our player. My main complaint is that the suspension system for this unit is designed for small to midsized vehicles, preferably those with a seperate headrest that can be raised and lowered. We have a full sized (Ford) van with headrests that are part of the seat. I had hoped to be able to hang the player between the two front seats and although I could get the looped part to *just* fit over one headrest, the length of strap was not long enough to reach to the other headrest."
3,Just another Dirt Band album....but that's good!!!!!,"Yeah, unfortunately, this is just another Nitty Gritty Dirt Band cd, nothing earthshaking. But that's not a bad thing, the Dirt Band are one of the most consistant groups in Country Music History.The thing that really differs on this cd is the fact that Bob Carpenter gets to sing lead on more than one song. His version of ""She"" is very well done. And also, their version of ""Get Back"" is one of the few Beatles covers that stands on it's own. It does't make you forget the Beatles version, but it doesn't sound like a copied version either.In all, I wouldn't say the music here is similar to their cd, ""Acoustic"" but more like ""Plain Dirt Fashion"" or ""Dream.""There is nothing bad about this album, you won't be upset if you get it. Personally, I am a huge fan of Jeff Hanna and would prefer that he took the lead on all of the songs, but I can live with this."
3,Works For A while. needs improvement,The only problem with this GBASP docking station is that the AC Adapter does not stay plugeed into it. I can't get my GBASP battery to fully recharge with this
3,GBA-SP Docking Station,"Found out what is it...Just a fancy Battery Charger.........Keep your GBA SP charged and ready to go with the GBA SP Docking Station from Intec. Keep your GBA SP's internal battery charged so it will be ready to play anytime. Plus, it's sleek and stylish design lets you display your GBA SP when it's not in use."
4,What is it?,"Can somebody please tell me what this is, and if it is needed and/or essential in the accessories area? Maybe if I write a review somebody else will write one saying WHAT IN THE WORLD THIS THING IS???PS i give this item 1 star because there is absoulutely NO REVIEW on it, not even a manufactures review or amazon.com review!!!"
2,book was in used but good shape,"the book was just a lil over done...and the thought seemed a lil scattered, course it could always be me..felt like he was a starter in the self help field. I do like some of his later books tho."
3,A lot like Phil McGraw....,"I've read this book after Life strageties of McGraw and found out that it has almost the same ideas, but this (Dyer) one was published earlier and has a more gentle approach, so don't hesitate and buy it!"
1,Pulling Your Own Strings,The book itself is very good. But speaking of this item - it has several pages (pages 170-203) replaced by some irrelevant content from another book! I'd like to speak with a customer service rep and my number is in the account.Thanks!Elaina
4,review of Pulling your own strings,"I read this book in 1979, it change everything about my life. I learnt that I really had the ability within me to handle differcult personalities. I still talk about the power of the information within this book!"
4,a helpful guide to developing and maintaining personal boundaries,"I found this book to be generally helpful. It is a frill-free guide on how to respect your own space and needs. I would not recommend this book for the folks with an overinflated ego or narcissistic tendencies as it will most likely be a guide to validate their fault behaviour but these people are the unlikely reader of this material anyways.Keeping in mind that this book is most likely to be picked up and read by the folks that are troubled and have a clear lack of assertiveness; it is very useful, concise and clear guide on how to develop and effectively enforce personal boundaries that will restore self-respect and improve relationships with others while maintaining your own integrity."
4,One of the better self-help books,"This one is fun! Dr. Dyer not only gives good advice, but can make you laugh at yourself. What better way to ""improve""?"
5,Taking back my strings thank you!,"Fantastic tape!!!!! I've listened to it 3 times now, taken notes and still want to hear it again and again. Seems each time I listen I hear something new"
3,looks cooler than works,"first of all, its not for hard camp work, or survival. it's tidy razor, which can be easily damaged. It's only for work with food and unskin an animal. the back of the blade is quite thick, almost 3/16"" (4 mm) but the edge is very thin and it feels it will broke easily. it has rat tale tang and the handle is very weak. little bit more preassure and you will damage knife. the real product is different from the picture. also there is huge wrong thing with the blade: one side has engraving with elk but in other side there is quite big inscription ""440 stainless CHINA"" is it inevitable to engrave on the blade that's its made in China? I don't understand why manufacturers spoil the blade with this.the sheath is ok, you will never guess that it's not real leather, vary nice high quality sheath, 10 times better than knife."
3,"Deceptive, big surprise","Purchased it as a gift. I was surprised how SMALL it was when it arrived. Comes in a tiny box of about 3.5 inches. It looked like a Miniature Pen, and I wanted to return it. My best friend said we should clip the cap to the back of the pen to make it look full size. Sure enough it looked bigger like that. I wanted to return it, but one of the guys saw it and wanted to keep it. I hope they will be happy with it."
4,Misleading Amazon Listing,"Fisher Space Pens are a great product, but I'm writing about the misleading way the listing for this item was presented. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but this listing, called ""Fisher Space Pen, Bullet Space Pen"" along with the photo of two pens, makes it look as though this is a listing for a pair of pens; one a regular sized Fisher Space Pen plus the smaller Bullet Pen together in a gift set. It is in fact only one bullet pen in a single box."
5,"Best pen ever, and reasonably priced.","This is probably the last pen you will ever buy. Unless you lose it.This has been to Iraq, multiple field exercises, washed and dried in clothes. Even through the washing and drying the pen didn't leak at all. It's written in rainstorms, subfreezing temperatures, and all manner of other ridiculous scenarios.The pen does become full size when you open it and attach the cap to the non writing end of the pen. It's about four inches long when closed and about 6.5/7 inches when open. Additionally, you can buy refills for the pen (for around $5, I think).The writing quality is that of a standard medium ballpoint pen. However, it ALWAYS works where cheaper ballpoint pens sometimes have to be coaxed into working.This pen is truly amazing and very durable."
3,Novelty Item,"It's nice and compact, which is good for carrying it around. Comes in a cool gift box.The cap is large enough to make holding it comfortable, yet it's small and very good for carrying around with you.Downside is that it doesn't write well at all, the ink flow is not constant and often it is a little light. It feels like it is scratching the paper a lot.I would suggest it as a gift or to keep in your pocket."
4,Nice and small,"This was almost exactly what I was looking for, it is small and it wrights and feels good in the hand. I ended up getting the clip for it and would recommend to anyone buying this pen buying the version that comes with a clip."
5,Space Pen Writes Upside Down and in Zero Gravity,This will be my third Space Pen. Easy to misplace but worth it because it's real easy to carry in pocket. The Russians use a pencil BTW.
4,"Great Price for pen, REFILL ALERT","I've had my Fisher Space Pen for three days now and have tested it out in every condition explained just to try it.Underwater:Wrote on bubble wrap under water (good luck writing on loose leaf paper underwater)Upside Down:Was able to write at any conceivable angle without losing flow of ink to tip of pen.WARNING: The technology of this company rests within the ink itself, not the pen. Each refill for ink costs $5 through their website.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the pen....just worried about how fast the ink needs to be refilled."
3,"Cool looks, mediocer functionality","I really like how small and compact pen in. Not having a clip clip could be problem for some people.I expected from space pen to have much better writing quality, as after couple of days the ink cartridgebecame a bit jiggly.I would recommend this pen for it convenient portability and document signing, but in any extensive textwriting this pen won't cut it"
2,pen's great. Stylus nib sucks,"I purchased this pen in the hopes that the stylus would be useful, adding great value to an already great pen.Wrong. The stylus does not work at all on the iPad screen. On none of the iPad versions.So sad, too bad, I'm mad . . . at not knowing that."
2,Beware the Space Pen,"The pen works well enough, but be careful when ordering. It comes in two models; one with a clip and one without. I made the mistake of automatically assuming any pen, especially one as small as this, would come with a standard clip. The only reason I can imagine for marketing it this way is to increase the buyer's chance of losing it."
1,Sadly lacking,"NOT ONE Bette Davis or James Cagney film! Two of Warner Brothers powerhouses! And the price is outrageous, considering most collectors have at least half these titles already."
2,"OK, let's be honest...","... bunches of these films were not even released by Warner Brothers. They are now owned by Warner Brothers, which has the largest film library in the world. This collection include the films of MGM, RKO, New Line Cinema, and various other films that somehow found their way into the Warner Brothers film library. For that matter why not include some of the films whose distribution rights were sold to Warner Brothers last year by the Sam Goldwyn estate? They have as much to do with Warner Brothers the studio and its history as Grand Hotel and Mutiny on the Bounty, both made during the Irving Thalberg era of MGM.Is this a five star collection of films? Certainly. I subtract two stars for trotting out the same old titles again and again and I subtract another star for just plain trying to pull the wool over my eyes and doing a bad job of it at that."
2,A Mixed Bag,"This offer from Warner Brothers at the $500+ launch price only makes sense if you want to start a blu ray collection from scratch and desperately want all the names in the 50 film collection right now regardless of the price .Bear in mind that only half of the titles are must have names in any serious blu ray collection and these are highly ranked by AFI so the collection does have a value at the right price. You can buy the 25 worthy names now on Amazon for about $250 to $275 and save yourself some bucks or alternatively wait about a year when this box set collection will be selling for about $150 to $200 through Amazon UK. Just make sure the blu rays are region free. If you want this box set, patience will be rewarded otherwise I would pass. Just my recommendation."
1,"If you like these movies, you likely already own most of them.","Personally, this set contains 24 movies I hate or dislike, about 5 I already own, 2 I want, 7 more I like but wouldn't necessarily buy and the rest I don't care about. That would likely be fairly accurate for most people. So, basically this is a colossal waste of money for most people since this very disparate set of movies is unlikely to appeal largely to anyone."
4,This little light of mine...,"This thing is great. Instead of lighting up just one area on the screen, it lights up the whole screen. It is great for when you are in the car or when it's dark. Plus, the thing magnifies the screen. The only bad thing is that you have to clean it alot because it gets dirty easily."
2,"Great hardware, software not so good","Bought it preloaded with Vista, and half my programs wouldn't work on it(useless). Formatted it and installed XP, and now the lenovo-downloaded drivers won't work(half-useless). Their ""legendary"" tech support told me to take a hike because I wasn't using the preload anymore(even though it was a completely clean install). I told them ""hey, you can spend 15 minutes helping me get these drivers working on XP, or you can spend 3 hours trying to get my programs to work on Vista"". Of course, they laughed and told me to play on the freeway. <sigh> Going to try Linux... I figure it can't get much worse than this?"
3,Really good and really disgusting,"For some reason this book reminded me of Perfume. Mandy Z was so obviously made depraved by his disability.The characters were interesting, though weak. I really didn't like any of them except Christine.The ending was really predictable.At least there won't be a sequel."
5,"Well worth owning, can't believe I'm the first!","I'm the first person to write a review of ""Danny's First Noel."" This is a wonderful CD and if you like the Capitol Steps, and you like Christmas music, you'll also love this CD. It has parodies of all the Christmas songs you've loved over the years, plus others you might not even know. Favorites of mine on this disc incluede ""Up in the Congress,"" ""Silver Foot,"" ""Rocketing Each Other's Hinterland,"" ""Here We go a Lobbying,"" and a gazillion more. Even ""Can't Wish You a Merry Christmas,"" wishes me a Merry Christmas. You should also get their other Christmas CD, ""All I Want for Christmas is a Tax Increase."""
1,"A girlie show, guys don't waste your time...","Well guys , don't waste your time on this girlie show. Probably written by, directed by, and produced by bleeding hearts...... Blah, blah, blah....... Loser."
4,Good show. Too bad it was cancelled,I watched series 1 & 2 and thought they were both good. Although a fair amount was resolved at the end of series 2 there is a cliff hanger to set up another series. The BBC cancelled the show and never made a 3rd series. I enjoyed the show but I was left with the feeling like I read a book and it ends with the last few chapters missing.
5,Excellet Show! Great Actor's & wonderful quality.,"I just loved this series. The actors were perfect in my eyes, plus a great deal of them I have saw in many things like Dr. Who/Torchwood & etc. I love watching UK shows & movies because I am from the USA, but I get sick of the same old American shows & plus I like to see a variety of different kinds of actors & they never let me down. Plus as a child I grew up through out my child hood watching Dr. Who with my best friend & we are still watching it (Smile). This show is exciting full of action & they really make you love these characters in this TV show. I just wish there were new seasons coming up."
4,I finally found it!!!!,"I bought the cassette of this album in the very early 80's and played it A LOT until it wore out and was never able to replace it. I didn't realize it was never one of John's bestsellers --silly people, they didn't know what they were missing! Unfortunatly it was after John's untimely death that the label decided to re-release the album on CD. Yeeaa! Now I finally have it in my grubby little paws again and can happily play it all that my heart desires. The songs 'Whalebones and Crosses', 'You say that the Battle is Over' and the one about Prince Edward's Island show John's genius. See for your self, I think you'll be pleasently surprised."
5,One Of Denver's Best,My wife and I picked up a cassette copy of this album on our way to California from New York. For years we played it until it broke and CDs were the new thing. But this album didn't get released right away and I thought I would never hear it again. Well it's on CD now and it is one of Denver's best ones. It is filled with the usual songs of nature that made John Denver so popular. His version of How Mountain Girls Can Love stands up to any bluegrass group out there. The two bonus tracks are not just some cheasy tracks that were laying around but are gems themselves. If you like John Denver then you need to pick up this CD and sit back and enjoy!!
1,Not happy,"I bought this product one month ago. When I plugged it into my lighter socket and connected the dongle to the GPS, the fuse blew. I bought more fuses and they all blew very quickly. I was shipped a new one because they said this should not be happening but the new one did the same thing. I would not recommend this product. I recently purchased the vent mount. I hope it works better."
2,"Good ""idea,"" bad quality","The idea of this mount is good, but the execution is poor.I purchased this and thought it was great for the first few weeks I had it. Despite being extremely careful with it, the exposed wire shown in photos started separating at it's insertion point and the device charging failed after only several weeks of use. This is just like cheap headphones that lose sound in one ear after a few weeks use because the thin audio cables start to break off of the ends at the ear buds.The end that plugs into the car's charging port also fell apart once while unplugging it, but I was able to reassemble it and use it again until that super-fragile electrical wire started to fail.You can consider it a disposable device.I won't buy another like this. I wish they would make one of much more rugged quality even for several dollars more cost."
1,good until my lighter started smoking,The product worked fine until the lighter part of the product came apart and started smoking and melted in my cigarette lighter. Not sure what happened
2,Loosy Goosy,"Most things that I plug into my power socket need a good shove and is real snug and hard to pull out. Now THIS item that I ACTUALLY NEED TO BEAR WEIGHT fits like a greased goose. My GPS just causes it to flip upside down. If your power socket is facing the floor you should be ok, but if it is facing you in the dash, and you want this arm to be pointing up.....get something else."
1,arkon mount,product shipped was not what was ordered. amazon shipped the wrong item. they shipped the gn097 with the usb plug.
2,"Good concept, poor execution","Purchased this for use with a Garmin nuvi 650, in a 2006 Honda Pilot. After waiting for a response from ARKON customer service, I went with this model instead of the usb plug version, as they were not sure if it would work correctly with my gps model. Sadly this mount works itself out of the socket in the dash and causes the gps to lose power."
2,Works But I Do Not Like It,This item works as intended but is flimsy in my opinion. Not very well made. I would not purchase again.
3,Really cool in theory,Product is great and probably works well with the 3in screens. I that've a 4.3in NUVI and the base moves around in the cigarette lighter. I still use it and like it just have to adjust often. It needs some extra support
3,Pretty good option,"I ordered this to use in one of my cars that I don't like to have the GPS suction cup on the windshield. It isn't as secure as I would like...it wabbles a bit in the socket, but it seems like it will do the trick for my purposes."
4,Great option,"We always had problems with the windshield suction cup mount falling off, tried the ""bean bag"" on the dash and it would slide around. This makes for a great option for mounting the Garmin Nuvi - it puts it in an easy to see spot in both my wife's Focus and my Mustang. The only downside is it will come loose going down bumpy roads and in the Focus it will slip and turn in the holder at times."
3,Garmin Cigarettelighter Mount,Works well and does the job but fits the cigarette lighter loosly and needs a wedge to tighten it. I would by another if it were tighter in the lighter.
3,"John Prine ""Diamonds In The Rough""","""Everybody"" 4/5""The Torch Singer"" 2/5""Souvenirs"" 3/5""The Late John Garfield Blues"" 2/5""Sour Grapes"" 3/5""Billy The Bum"" 3/5""The Frying Pan"" 4/5""Yes I Guess They Oughta Name A Drink After You"" 4/5""Take The Star Out Of The Window"" 3/5""The Great Compromise"" 4/5""Clocks And Spoons"" 3/5""Rocky Mountain Time"" 3/5""Diamonds In The Rough"" 2/5""Diamonds In The Rough,"" John Prine's second album, did not receive the same response as his timeless debut. This, however, does not make his sophomore effort a passer-by. Great tunes include ""The Great Compromise"" and ""Yes I Guess They Oughta Name A Drink After You.""Overall rating: Three stars"
5,The Best,"This John Prine's best album in my opinion and one of my favorite albums of all time. I was looking to see if it had been remastered. It doesn't appear so. It could sure use it. I guess most people have forgotten this gem so they haven't gone to the trouble to remaster. It IS a ""Diamond In The Rough"". Get it."
3,Prine Unplugged!!!,"Actually Prine has alot of songs that are acoustical but that is the theme of this album. It basically is campfire type songs and while good, I find it slightly dissappointing compared to other great albums he has done."
4,SciFi fun,"I enjoyed this when it was briefly on TV, and I still enjoy it! I was happy when I discovered the movies that finished the series, too!"
5,Love,"....the Who and Tommy is just fabulous. Great retro, look back on what we were watching as teens. My 15 year old daughter loves the movie. Ann Margret, what can I say about her part.....unreal."
3,Tommy,"The DVD was in great shape physically but, there were gaps of silence and actual freeze of play various times as I was viewing the DVD."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Tommy has some great sequences (e.g. Elton John as the Pinball Wizard) but its a less-than-cohesive movie which runs far too long and whose attempts at allegory fall pretty flat; even if you like The Who, you may not like this subpar film."
1,HA HA HA,"After hearing such good things about this movie and having a great time being in the stage rock opera i was quite excited about finally seeing it. the after i did i was quite excited about never seeing it again. this movie is a plain example of when directors try to be deep and sybolic and just mess it up royaly. this was honestly the sadest thing i had ever seen. the only reason i didn't stop it after the baked beans scene was because of the soundtrack. THE WHO and Pete towndstead are AMAZING, but the direction was horrific. i honestly felt bad for jack nickolson oliver reed and any other cast member. Ken Russel butchered what could have been an amazing movie. i had to watch like 3 jewison film after seeing this to convince myself that film wasn't a curse on the earth. i wish tht this film could be remade with a director who actually knew what he was doingTHAT IS ALL"
1,WEIRD MUSICAL,"During this year's Superbowl, the guys were talking about which songs THE WHO would and did sing. Tommy was one of the songs they did and the movie was brought up. My husband said he never saw it, so I bought it for him. Weirdest, stupidist thing I have ever sat through. Horrible acting, dumb story line, WOW! What else can I say. Unless you possess and use MASSIVE amounts of drugs and alcohol.... I would not recommend it. Not rated, but NOT for children or minors! If you are still interested in wasting your money on this movie, please take mine (very cheap)!"
1,Made Me Wish I Was At Least Deaf And Blind,"With so much talent invested in this movie, how could things have gone so horribly wrong? Roger Daltrey prances around with a blank look on his face, vaguely giving the impression he is either in a shampoo or tampon commercial. Ann-Margaret writhes on the floor with a giant sausage-shaped pillow, while covered in beans that spray out from a television set. Eric Clapton, appearing to be in a heroin-induced coma, portrays a singing preacher with all the charisma of a dead turtle. Elton John, Tina Turner, Oliver Reed, and even Jack Nicholson all attempt career suicide with their zany and misguided contributions to this catastrophe. To top it all off, the ludicrous premise of the album (vegetable-like pinball champion becomes messiah) is kept intact, while the great music has been replaced with the sort of noise the CIA would play to torture prisoners. Consider yourself warned."
1,An Incredible Waste of Talent,"Director Ken Russell's godawful 1975 adaptation of the rock opera ""Tommy"" takes Bad Cinema to an entirely new level. Rarely has so much talent been desecrated for such a futile gesture. It makes one appreciate the subtle nuances of Ann-Margret's ""Viva Las Vegas."""
3,Tommy is dated!!,"I recently purchased ""Tommy"" the movie and had some friends over to watch it....wow....was this movie dated....it was a lot better in the 70's when we were all stoned out of our minds....sitting thru the movie was like sitting thru a dentist visit, although we all had a good laugh watching the over acting of Ann Margaret....and Oliver Reed....during the song ""I'm Free"" (which by the way is the most rocking song in the movie) Roger Daltry is running on air and on fake water and stuff which is really bad....perhaps we should have gotten stoned first....like the good old days!!"
2,What is this film about?,"I have to give this film kudos because it is really one of the first things that got me hooked on The Who. However, I must protest the music and singing in this film. Jack Nicholson? Already, this has ""disaster"" written all over it. Plus, to take all of that great Who music and synthesize it, well...that's just wrong. The Who shouldn't be heard that way. And then there's the plot...well, there is no plot. It was insane. If they were trying to clear up any confusion over the album, they failed miserably. This was just too weird. But then, I like weird. I just don't like incoherence. The best part of this film was Keith Moon as Uncle Ernie. Man, if that doesn't keep you awake at night, I don't know what will! See it at least once and then judge for yourself."
3,GOOD AND BAD,"Tommy has some good and bad qualities in it.....Roger Daultry, Tina Turner, Kieth Moon, and ESPECIALLY Elton John offered wonderful musical performances. However, Ann-Margaret and Oliver Reed were so bad and have no talent. Both of those casting decisions were dreadful...The music was good (can not compare to the original album) but is tolerable. The visuals are confusing and you become even more confused trying to make sense out of it....I give the movie 3 stars ONE for Elton John and ONE for Roger Daultry and ONE for Tina Turner and Kieth Moon...You have to be a cult follower of Tommy to really enjoy it"
1,It just goes on too long,"TOMMY is one weird movie. But it is watchable ... for awhile ... then it just gets so stupid. What is the point of it all? It bombed at the movies, but got some exposure through a quite acceptable soundtrack - which featured the awesome ""Pinball wizard"" by Elton John.Overall, Pete Townsend spoilt the original idea of Tommy by doing this movie. If you must see it, just watch the Tina Turner scene."
5,COUSIN KEVIN IS DA BOMB!!!,"Why doesn't anyone mention him? This DVD is worth the price just to see that scene!!! I love everything else too but I like to watch the Cousin Kevin scene over and over again. The movie version is WAYYYY better than the dull, slow version on the album!!! Same thing goes for many of the songs. All in all, this is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable musicals of all time!!!"
2,A poorly adapted movie from a brillant Album,"Brfore seeing the movie I listneed to the album Tommy several times and fell in love with it. I rented the movie last night and watched it. It is campy, poorly acted, poorly sung, and too upbeat for what it is. Although, I feel that if you are a who fan, you should probablly see it. It made some more sense of the albums plot. It was also worth sitting through it to see Eric Clapton worship Marlyn Monroe and to see Elton John in ten feet tall boots playing pin ball. Also it was funny to see Jack Nickolson try to sing with an english accent."
4,Dude this movie's a riot,"When I first saw this movie I was really like ""WTF?"" This was because I had seen the movie right after I'd seen a pretty good performance of it in the Birkshires (MA). However, when I was watching parts of it a few nights ago I had never had such a good laugh. There's nothing better than watching Roger Daltrey jog in place, lip synch pretty badly to ""Freedom"", and be super imposed against background movies including a reacting volcano and a tidal wave!"
3,Underwhelming,"I have known about and heard about this movie for so many years, I expected something quite remarkable. In my opinion it was very poorly produced, and could have been made much more enjoyable. There was a problem with the sound technique which resulted in miserable quality output, but it was not worth my trouble to figure out and try to compensate for it, because the movie in general was not worth the effort. The Who's music deserves a better vehicle than this. The DVD now reminds me that I should be more selective about buying movies."
2,a lil corny,"i got this 4 a friend & he enjoyed it very much so it was his gift. i, however, thought the acting was a bit corny & over the top. the highlight of the film was Elton John's performance of ""Pinball Wizard."" ive always liked his rendition better than the original. & those shoes, what can u say? Elton John has always been a great performer."
2,"Good Music, Dumb Movie","I loved the album Tommy, and so I expected to love the movie. Frankly, I would have been better off playing it with my eyes closed. Yes, some sequences were interesting, rather like MTV videos as they used to be. More were just plain annoying. I did not like the people who played Tommy's parents, or rather his mother, played by Ann-Margaret, who was OK when she was younger, and his step-father, played by Oliver Reed (who has done some good stuff, but this wasn't it). Tina Turner, as the acid queen, was over-done, but at least we could understand the erotic nature of her role. But the iron maiden torture was absurd.It seems whoever wrote this nonsense had no respect for the music, or the musicians, but believed all acid trips are bummers.OK, Roger Daltrey was pretty sexy, and that may make it worthwhile for some; but find it on a bargain table, because it's not worth much. Two stars, one for the music and one for Daltrey's physical presence."
4,Rockin' Film,"I am not sure of Ann-Margaret and Oliver Reed were the best choice for Tommy, but they do bring lots of talent to the score.Tina Turner and Jack Nicholson absolutely steal the show. If you need any reason to watch this film or listen to the soundtrack, it should be for Tina and Jack.The film does not seem as dated as say the film version of Hair, but if it were refilmed today it would be amazing."
3,who's inconsistent?,"After seeing the broadway version and listening to the movie soundtrack, I was anxious to see the video. Unfortunately the movie was a disappointment from the start, beginning with a shaky zoom on a waterfall and continuing through some drug inspired but shoddy special effects. The music is - as always - spectacular and it was nice to see a different take on the plot from the one in the Broadway version. The movie is worth renting just to see the masses pay homage to a huge porcelain Marilyn Monroe and the bizarre, syringe covered armour that appears during the ""Acid Queen"" number. Also memorable are Elton John's outfit (aren't they all memorable??) and the number where Mrs Walker shatters her TV screen allowing a flood of baked beans to spread across her bedroom.Final advice: rent, don't buy."
3,"Odd, but enjoyable.","This movie/rock opera seemed very strange the first time I saw it a few years ago. It still seems a bit out of the norm to me, although that's not neccesarily a bad thing. Some of the scenes have no poinin the seemed to t, while the one right after it hit on the ""whoah, cool!"" factor. That and several of the songs from this movie get stuck in my head so easily. (Pinball wizard, for one.)If you like movies that aren't what most people call normal or just want to try something new, get ""Tommy."""
2,not great in my eyes,"holy shizzle. I really got bored with all of Daltrey's shirtless scenes and his running around, swimming and whiny babbling. not for my taste. Oliver Reed and Ann Margaret are smashed as Daltry's parents and Jack Nicholson only has a cameo part. like I said before it wasnt great in my eyes"
5,WHO Fans are WAY Too Hard on this Fim!,"If You look over the people who gave this Film a bad review, it's most likely from a ""WHO"" Fan and they're basing their review on what THEY wanted the Film to be or Think it should have been... they're comparing it to the Original Concept album from 1969, which I believe is Totally Unfair. It You were like Me, and saw this Movie without the prejudice of being a WHO Fan, than You would Judge the Film on it's Own Merits. I Think this is one of the Best Films I've ever Seen. I've watched it More times than I care to admit, because I see something different in it every signal time. That's just one of the things that makes this such a Great Film... it keeps You Thinking. If You're a WHO Fan, than go back and Listen to the 69 Version.. You KNOW that it was Purposely Left Open for Interpretation.... So give Ken Russell a Break."
3,Good and Bad,"Tommy has some good and bad qualities in it.....Roger Daultry, Tina Turner, Kieth Moon, and ESPECIALLY Elton John offered wonderful musical performances. However, Ann-Margaret and Oliver Reed were so bad and have no talent. Both of those casting decisions were dreadful...The music was great. Pete Townshend's re-recording of ""Amazing Journey"" is fantastic. ""Pinball Wizard"" sung by Elton John is the highlight of the movie. You should watch this movie just to see him. He steals the movie and it would be empty without Elton. The visuals are confusing and you become even more confused trying to make sense out of it. Director Ken Russell was probably under the influence of drugs during the entire production. I give the movie 3 stars ONE for Elton John and ONE for Roger Daultry and ONE for the soundtrack...You have to be a cult follower of Tommy to give it 5 stars."
1,Tommy,"Even after all these years I still do not understand what the movies is about. It's boring and stupid. Only reason I ordered the movie was for the music. The band teacher at my son's school will be having them play some of the songs from this movie, which I do not understand either."
1,THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE FILM EVER PRODUCED!,"THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE FILM EVER PRODUCED, EVEN MORE BIZZARE THAN THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW!!! I cannot recommend this movie as being a ""classic"": its bizarre plot (a deaf, mute and dumb blond man who is miraculously healed and then worshipped at a type of messiah) is the MOST BIZARRE thing I've ever seen on the screen! You won't believe the ""Marilyn Monroe"" worship temple scene: instead of a communion wafer and wine, they are given drugs (pills) and whisky by Marilyn Monroe look-alikes! The main character's parents are brutally murdered at the end of the movie, and the whole movie makes very little sense; even more bizzare than the other 2 rock operas of the 1970s: Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Jesus Christ Superstar. The scene with the woman swimming in beans is truly disgusting! A waste of film!"
1,There Is no Movie that is worse,"Seeing as how I cannot give Tommy zero stars, I will explain why Tommy, the so called ""Concept Album"" and ""the Who"" belong in a dumpster full of fire and nasty pointy sticks. First of all, the Who are not even a good band. They simply rode the coatails of success from other FAR BETTER british bands like the Stones and Pink Floyd. Secondly, this movie is garbage. Thea acting and editing are awful, and the story likewise. As for the so called ""concept album"" that is tommy, Its not a concept album because it has nothing new. To be a concept album you have to intruduce a NEW concept. Tommy just borrows from other better bands. If you want a real concept album, buy Dark Side of the Moon, by pink Floyd. Not, i repeat Not the Wall."
1,Left out the overture,"It has been many years since I saw the original Tommy at the theater, but, as I recall, they played the overture when the sun was going down at the beginning of the movie. This DVD left out the overture entirely."
3,Preety Good,"I had just seen the play and loved it so i wanted to see the movie. I wasn't as impressed with the movie. I was also surprised when the cast in the play I had seen had better voices then the movie. I thought it was cool how the movie was made in that freaky kind of way that music videos are made. I also love Elton John's glasses, outfit,and Shoes. Elton did great but I didn't like his voice in it. Also the movie's songs are slower then the play's. And what is up with that ending. There where some diffrences from the play that i hated. Let me know what you think of my review e-mail me at Merl1111@aol.com"
4,Funny 70's retrospective,"When I was 18 or so I listened to The Who's music and I also listened to the album Tommy. I can agree that it's not so great, unless you have seen the movie. I finally had the chance to see it recently and I enjoyed enormously.The movie is a great wink and attempts to laugh at everything, including stardom itself. Nice that it features some performances of the 70s most famous popstars, like Eric Clapton, Tina Turner and Elton John.Every shot in this movie, from starting with a picknick somewhere in the countryside until Roger Daltrey climbing the same mountainous countryside, is full of nostalgia if you've grown up in the seventies. I can agree with some other reviewers; this movie should not be watched completely sober nor should you be to serious about the plot or characters.But I don't recall The Who being such a serious band anyway. :-) Enjoy!"
4,This DVD rocks!,The 5.1 Dolby Digital remix enhances an already solid sountrack of toe tapping Who tunes. Nobody says a word in this movie because the music does the talking. The visuals are provacative and move the story right along. The pitfalls of commmercialism message applies today more than ever before.
3,tommy rock opera review,"I never saw this when it came out so I finally got a copy. It is true Who through and through but I found the ""music only"" (without singing) parts were long and tedious. Tina Turner and Ann Margaret were superb. The ""church"" scene was a nice touch, and I imaging the Who got criticized for making light of western religion back then."
4,Pretty good Rock Film,"This classic rock oprea made in 1969 turns into a film in 1975. Great cast in this film such as Eric Clappton, Elton John, Tina Turner, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, Keith Moon, Roger Daltrey, and a short scene of Arthur Brown(Had hit ""Fire""). The songs are great but the song ""1921"" is ""1951"". This film starts with it's romatic begining to it's bloody end. Tommy is a classic rock film a will be forever."
4,Tommy DVD,"What a hoot. I missed it in the 70's. It's fun to see the stars in different roles, Takes a shot on religion and the church."
4,watchin dis now on vh1,"love the sequences featuring tina turner (the acid queen) and the eric clapton part. i am only familiar with the who's tommy album. always shied away from the soundtrack to this just because i am a who fan and the who didn't perform all of it but now after viewing the movie i might check out the soundtrack. this is a pretty trippy movie, msybe even campy in places. Reminiscent imo to Pink Floyd's 1979 masterpiece,The Wall."
3,Not anybody's best,"This film has some of the wildest sets and costumes and shenanigans you'll ever see! Not to mention an amazingly outrageous cast. But most of the music is not well performed and the film doesn't come close to the effect of the original album. See it for fun. But stick to the original album for the best rendering. It all works better in your own mind than letting Ken Russell fill it in for you. And I LIKE Ken Russell! Check out ""Women in Love"" His masterpiece! That's the problem here. Ann-Margret is better in a lot of other stuff. The Who is better elsewhere. Eric Clapton is better elsewhere. So too Jack Nicholson, Oliver Reed, and everybody else. No one is up to par except Tina Turner."
2,You had to be there.,"Being a child of the era, this was a hoot to watch! Elton John and Jack Nicholson never looked so good - and at the same time, haven't changed a bit! Very ""period"" piece. However, if you don't LOVE the WHO, you will find yourself in the middle of it, a)inexplicably needing to clean the entire house. b) worrying because you realize you really did do too many drugs in the 70's. Watch it for nostalgia, not for good film value."
1,not meant to be watched sober,"this movie was, im sure, (althought i havnt tried myself... and wont) was made to be watched while under the infulence of... anything really..but watching it sober just makes the songs drive you flippin crazy (its quite repetative) and the story make no sense...in fact the subject matter is as bad as a clockwork orange so i definately do not reccomend this film for anyone under 18. But the cast is impressive."
2,What The...?,"Okay, a kid witnesses his step father kill his father and goes ""deaf, dumb and blind"", makes his family rich by playing pinball, wakes up and tries to enlighten the world by telling everyone to play pinball ""deaf, dumb and blind"", at which point they revolte and kill his family and he goes and climbs a mountain. Huh???"
2,Garbage,"Ok let me say that Daultry himself, Elton John, and Tina Turner did amazing jobs (that's why I gave this film 2 stars instead of one) but every other part of this movie was pure garbage. This movie bears little resemblance to the Who's amazing rock album or the equally amazing stage version. It's an ugly, psycodelic excuse for a movie. The sogs are rearranged and destroyed, the cast (except those mentoned above) are horrible and have little or no singing abiities. I'm all for artistic creativity, but so many of the visuals in this adapttion make no sense (expect maybe if you're smoking something you shouldn't be) Some adapttions are so bad they're funny and worth a view just for a laugh, but that's not the case here. If you're curious and have money to waste, go ahead and buy this video, but I would recommend you use your money for the original album by the Who or the Original Broadway Cast Recording."
3,Classic Blues,"The sound is a little old-fashioned, but the playing remains of interest. Not as flamboyant as many of the modern players - just good, solid blues that is consistently entertaining. A classic."
3,Good sample of influential guitarist!,What's not to like. Stormy Monday is worth the price alone. Great early guitarist a budding guitarist must listen to.
5,amazing blues,"A must have CD for all blues lovers!!! T-Bone Blues is a great blues album, order it now, you won't be dissapointed."
2,where is all the music???,the info listed 21 songs......after downloading there were only 11 songs!! got ripped off don't ya' think? Come on Amazon make it right will ya.
3,Sam & Dave CD,I got what I ordered. The plastic case was broken. The CD Now preferred buyers club claims to have a link to report this type of claim. The link is a dead end. Service rates a single star. Another disc in the same order also had a broken case. The club should back up their products.
4,"Good collection, but there are a couple of things that could be better","I ordered this disc in February 2011.Great collection but as several other reviewers mention, there is a audible hiss when ""Soothe Me"" opens. The only remastered version of that song is a Live cut, AFAIK.There is also another version of ""Hold On, I'm Coming"" that is not on this disc.It fades with the phrase ""take my hand"" and seems a bit more soulful.Given that there is a ""better"" version of ""Hold On"" out there and that the disc needs remastering, I say this gets 4 stars."
2,Okay,I do not like this item bc when you put on pants or a shirt the balls have a chance of getting stuck or falling off. The seller was great about shipping and a timely response. The product just was not worth it.
5,Kissingers Chrystal Ball,"I read this book in college as required reading at the time, 1966. The concept of Limited War as stated by Kissinger was a vision into the future. Limited war as a function of human life on earth, the doctrine of survival. I believe it was this concept that saved the world from Nuclear war during the Cuban Missile crisis when the Soviets realized it was a mistake to tempt such an apopolyptic battle. It is the spectre of that battle that keeps the world safe, and most importantly, for those who know and care, Dictators with no reqard for human life or existence, not even their own, must be reduced to a very small space on earth.I now have ordered that great book again to re-read."
1,Movie about the lives of disfunctional people at a dot com,"If you are looking for a movie about the inter workings of a start up dot com business, this movie isn't it. There are very few scenes about how a dot com is started. Instead, this movie is about the disfunctional lives of many of the people that work at a dot com called Hot-Tots.com. They want to take the company public, but they are declined due to Hot-Tots.com's poor financial results. In the end, they sell the business and all of the employees are angry. That's basically it."
2,little new,The story of Lady be Good is remarkable but when you buy this book you also realise that it is of limited scope. This book contains so much padding and speculation that it becomes annoying. Not well written and with poorly produced photographs.
3,"Interesting, if you discount the speculative narrative","This book appears well-researched but didn't come across as particularly authoritative. I appreciate that there must be some speculation about the events that occurred, but the author turned to fantasy when he speculated about the thoughts of the crew on their trek, trying to expand on cryptic diary entries. Such an approach significantly devalued later statements by the author about the condition of artifacts. All in all, the book was a little unsatisfying."
3,I like Hal,"He always put out interesting product with varying successes. I usually question the ""what's he thinking?"" part of many of the tracks I don't like. This is not one my favorite CDs of his but keep at it Hal, you nut."
2,A good synopsis but a horrible story,"When you read the synopsis of the story it sounds good but when it comes to the storytelling and introduction of characters they kind of just jump into it leaving you with no idea of who the characters are and why you should care about them. Which drags the story, another problem is not only do they not put enough into a character but they introduce another when many are left incomplete.(spoiler alert- they also kill a character off before giving us a complete sense of who he is and expects the audience to care). So yeah I'm giving it two stars, if you want to watch it just go online don't waste your money."
5,Does the job perfectly,I bought this unit because of the reviews on it. It was the right price and it does the job perfectly. I live in a small apartment and with this unit and the other unit I already had I feels like I have central air. I use the Frigidaire unit in my bedroom and the operating sound helps me to fall asleep faster and more sound. I am not disappointed.
4,Frigidaire,I love this little A/C. Great product for the money. I haven't experienced any of the loud noises some other buyers have mentioned. It did leak a little the first night we used it but it hasn't done it since and we use it every day. It does a great job of cooling our little bedroom and it does it quickly.
2,Disappointed,"It is not as good, as the five year old Gold Star model, that we replaced it with. It is not very cold, and is noisy. The size however, worked well in our window."
4,Good for the price,"This A/C is good for the price. I paid $112 for it and I'm satisfied. This is a complimentary A/C to a bigger A/C. The room it's in is about 150 square feet or a little bigger. The best way to operate this thing is to put a wind machine fan in the corner on the same side of the wall as the A/C, slightly above the A/C. Angle the fan on a 45 degree angle toward the direction that the air is blowing out from the A/C (the angle is not back towards the A/C, but almost in the same direction that the A/C is blowing). Tilt the fan slightly back so that the fan will blow slightly upward. Run the fan on low speed or medium at the most, and the A/C on high speed. The fan will help circulate the cool air that's blowing from the A/C and will also reduce humidity. Also, this A/C is not noisy and I see some people say it's loud. It's not."
3,Good news is it does cool,"Been using this a.c. for about a month. Cools well. But disappointed that there's no energy saver feature. It just runs non-stop. Also would have liked a remote. And since several retailers sell small air conditioners with these features for the same price, you might want to look around before purchasing this one."
1,Never worked and Customer Service is substandard,"I purchased this air conditioner less than a year ago. The first unit had to be taken back to the store as it would never come on. The second unit I brought home as soon as you attempted to turn the unit on, the knobs cracked on the side. The unit would never get cold, just cool. I called customer service and it took them three months just to get me new knobs and the knobs they sent didn't fit this unit. Told them the unit doesn't work right and they told me that I could mail it in for repairs...well, what do I do for the three months it takes them to fix it? Really bad air conditioner, really bad service from the company. Don't recommend purchasing a product manufactured by this company."
1,Buyer beware,"Although this product will function as advertised, be aware that when the compressor kicks in, it is REALLY noisy. Not just a simple buzzing, but rather a low, loud, hum that will actually travel through the walls to other rooms in the house."
1,Badly Dented,"I sent this air conditioner back because it was caved in on one side. Definitely did not happen in shipment as the box was intact. Had to go thru the trouble to return it. Amazon made the return easy but I still had to drive this thing to the Post office and place it on the counter! FUN! I would only buy an air conditioner from a store but I guess the same thing could have happened there. The box looks fine, then you get it home, cut the whole box open and find that it's caved in on one side! I received an email from Amazon that I should be receiving my refund shortly."
2,"Girls talked, they said, "" No""","Name the first toe-dip into the '70's New Wave pool.Wrong! It was Dave Edmunds! with his slowed down hard hitting 1973 hit cover of ""I Hear You Knocking"". Not on this CD. Maybe his version of ""Sabre Dance"" not on this CD, either.The England Pub Rock of the early mid '70s scooted Dave into bunches of bands, most importantly a friendship with Nick Lowe a love of '50's American Rock and Roll and a desire to put in a contempory hurray!This Cd has what is probably the first example of a top 40 '70s New Wave hit, ""Girl's Talk"", written by Elvis Costello, produced by soon to be band member Nick Lowe.The rest of the CD is a nice reminder of LP fun, but hardly the example of Dave at his best. This CD is for only those who want a half smile not a full grin"
5,An excellent reference,"This book is worth the purchase price for the beauty of its photographs alone. What a treat--it's the loveliest orchid reference book I've seen. In situ photos of the Vietnamese slippers abound, as do detailed climate charts and habitat info. Great for the armchair gardener, but a must-have for the Paphiopedilum collector. The only way you'd get a better idea of the growing conditions and habitat of these plants would be if you traveled to Vietnam yourself."
5,Spooky Good,"This is a four-cd collection of recordings of the famous short-wave ""numbers"" stations, rumored to be operated by various covert intelligence operations (CIA, Mossad, MI5, KGB, etc.). It comes with a large booklet containing ""a beginners guide"" and extensive transcripts of the broadcasts.I'd heard about these stations for years, but I'd never actually heard them before getting this collection. Knowing about them is one thing, but listening to them is a totally different thing. They're bizarre, they're fascinating, they're spooky.I'd recommend this to a couple different groups: If you're big into government conspiracy theories, this is an excellent archive of what the guys in control are doing with your hard-earned tax money. If you're into noise and pure ambient music, then this is basically a wonderful collection of ""found sound"" pieces. It'd also be excellent raw material to incorporate into new creations."
5,"Eerie, mysterious, entriguing.","Now if I remember what I read correctly, these were recorded in the 80s & released on CD by Irdial in the late 90s. There's someone selling a used copy for a rediculous $200, but Irdial has uploaded these tracks onto the net for free download, or you can buy a CD from them for about $10, 1.59 UK, & 2.79 anywhere else in Europe.What makes Numbers Stations facinating? Is it because they were ment for specific ears & you're hearing something you shouldn't be listening to? Is it because you will never know what the messages mean? Is it because they sound decades older than they really are, as if they were made around or before WW2 & being projected forward in time? Is it simply interest in listening to robotic voices chant numbers & names in foreign languages? Is it because you can only hear them live at certain times on certain stations & only on shortwave radios?"
4,The Best Kaiju Films at a Bargain Basement Price,"Don't let the negative talk about the subtitles fool you. Despite Mill Creek's goofy subs, these are still three of the best kaiju films ever made at an amazing price point. If you've ever thrilled to a Japanese monster movie, you'll love these three films. The video quality is top notch and the audio is very good too. The only thing that got short shrift is the subtitles, but come on, the stories are still very easy to follow and enjoy. I'm just glad we got these on blu ray at all!"
4,Gamera Collector's Edition-Blu-Ray,"Hello, I am really into Horror's, but I was looking through the DVD's and saw this one. I have never heard of it before, so I took a gamble. I am so glad I did, as this was a fabulous movie to watch, it sure had me engrossed in it from start to finish. Then it had a touch of sadness to see the monster get hurt. It's a must see and I hope they make others."
3,false information,"I watched only the first part of Gamera, first i like Godzilla moreand secondly they wrote its running time of 103 mins, strange myneruns only 95 mins.Counting could be difficult sometimes, i know but its unacceptable.i call that thievery."
1,I LOVE GAMERA...,"... And I really wish I had access to a Blu-Ray on which to play these awesome movies.Brilliant monster movies. Welcome extras.But seriously... no DVD release? That hurts, people."
3,Not ALL Gamera Films,"There are actually 12 Gamera films, so having them label this as the Complete Collection is hogwash. It is only movies 9-11. Albeit that the box set of these three is beautiful, the blu-ray is better quality all around."
1,Horrible localization,"The movies themselves are excellent, but the subtitling is perhaps the worst professional work I've seen, especially with the first and third films. In the first, none of the Japanese on screen text is translated, despite the movie using a large number of things like newspaper headlines to provide information. The third is the worst by far, with a good 20% of it not being subtitled at all, and quite of few of the subtitles being mistranslated. It's an absolute shame, since these are great movies that deserve much better treatment."
3,Some problems keep this set from being totally recommended,"Image and sound quality is very good on the three movies, especially on the third one. The cardboard slipcase is colorful and attractive, with a very professional design, much better than other Mill Creek releases. The problem of this set are the subtitles on the second disc: the movie ""Gamera 3"" has lots of missing and out of sync sentences which make the movie much less enjoyable (for example, Kurata Shinya's explanation of the Gamera graveyard is totally lost if you watch the movie that way). And subtitles on extra features get progressively out of sync until there is a delay of seven seconds between characters speaking and subtitles appearing on screen. It's something regrettable which should have been corrected before release and keeps this release from being totally recommended."
2,"So close, yet so far....","I was really looking forward to this set the minute I saw it. The picture quality was awesome and the deleted scenes and behind-the-scene extras were a nice bonus. However, the fact that English subtitles drop 1 in 8 lines of dialogue is inexcusable. They didn't even re-dub the English version, simply reapplying the ADV dub. The only improvements I can find about this version is the picture quality and the box art..... It's a terrible shame because these films deserve so much more than this lack-luster treatment"
4,Hollywood Hills 90028,Sort of a campy fun movie with Bethany Frankel and directed by documentary filmmaker Barry Roskin Blake. Not the greatest picture but fun none the less.
2,Brief. Not what I expected,"This book is rather thin for the price, although there are full color photos on nearly every page. The bindings were neat, if you're into the style suggested by the picture on the book cover. I am not, so ""beautiful"" is too strong a word. I was expecting something broader in scope and less kitschy."
3,good debut,This is the album that kicked off a great career. It may not be the greastest album they made but it's not bad either. It's obvious that they were looking for there sound. I would reccomend this for die hard fans like me.
3,Daryl's and John's not-too-popular debut album,"Daryl Hall's and John Oates' debut album gained very little attention when it was released in 1972. Not one song from this album appears on the 2004 compilation ULTIMATE DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES. The following year,H&O scored their first #1 hit,SHE'S GONE,from their second album ABANDONED LUNCHEONETTE. That song would later be covered by the R&B group Tavares who had another hit,a cover of the Bee Gees' MORE THAN A WOMAN. Both words in this album's title are homonyms of the duo's last names. ""Whole"" is the homonym of Daryl's real last name Hohl. And of course,""oats"" is the homonym of John's last name."
3,An adequate debut effort,"1972's 'Whole Oats,' while not a spectacular debut, iscertainly a step above(and is more appealing than) theirnear-disastrous third album 'War Babies' from 1974.Half of the album is pretty good - the rocking 'I'm Sorry,''Fall In Philadelphia,' 'Goodnight And Goodmorning,' 'Lilly(Are You Happy),' and the more reflective 'Waterwheel'and 'Lazyman.'Yes, I admit I own this one(as well as 'War Babies') on LP.Definitely for the H&O; completist/collector, but it mighthold some interest for a more adventurous casual fan whowants to dig a little deeper than just the hits."
2,"not a good books for digital photo, but goob for adobe","This books is more focus in how to edit your photos with adobe photoshop, that how to take a picture. the author do not cover the diferents techniques, nor he explain how to improve the shot with you camera or before you take the picture, basilly the books has 4 or 6 chapters on the difirent features in the camera and then goes on in how to edit the photos in you computer. not a good book if you want to improve you technique on taking pictures"
4,An Oldie But Underrated Goodie,"I love Mott & have for years. This is sorta a catch-all recording, but it shows of the stuff they had beside ""All the Young Dudes"" about as well as anything they ever did, really. It's a remarkably solid record. I had the old vinyl LP years ago, and had practically forgotten about it when I got to poking around on the Intertubes and found it again. I'm glad I did. Mott's sound is something like what might've been if Bob Dylan was and Englishman fronting David Bowie's early 70s groups. Two of my favorite song titles are on this disc, too: ""The Wheel of the Quivering Meat Conception"" (pretty much a throw away vamp @ :26, and the nearly 5 min long ""Death May Be Your Santa Claus.""). What can I say? Those phrases stick with you over the years."
1,An insult to intelligence,I found this book insulting and the author ill-informed. I am pagan and know hundreds of fellow pagan of which none of them wish to control this country or the right wing who ownes it. They wish to practice their religion with out persecution. Christianity has a long trail of intollerance and hatred toward all other religions but their own. Instead of pointing fingers at pagans they need to turn the finger on themsevles. This book is breeding more hatred and intollerance for others. The last thing we need. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.
1,an insult to descent people,"I find this book to be very insulting. I am a pagan and I am a great person, I have friends of many religions, the majority of which are christian. This book was not researched or correct in any way. Pagans do not want to control anything except their own lives. Christianity has had more control over people and lives than any other religion in history. to any one who likes this book, read a little history. Christianity was the cause of most of the wars in the last 2000 years and has done some horrible deeds, like witch hunts."
1,Sad Book,"As a Christian, reading this kind of hateful bigotry makes me sick. The author should go back and re-read the passage in the Bible about loving others being the highest commandment Jesus gives. Note that the Bible doesn't say we should love all the straight white middle-class (or upper-class) Christians. It says to love everyone without exception, and that is exactly what true Christians do. Any Christian who doesn't love others just because they practice a different religion from him or her needs to pray to the Holy Spirit to fill their heart and show them Jesus' true path."
1,religious tolerance,"Pagans don't want to take over the country, govt, world, etc. To pressure someone into a certain religion or to make accusations about people who follow a religious path that's different from your own - that to me is cult-like. I highly suggest you take a religious studies class at your local university if you want to learn about religions. This book, is at best, slanderous against all pagans and promotes intolerance. If you're a Christian, please take a religious studies course before you blindly follow someone else's claims that a certain religion is ""bad"" or ""dangerous"". That is what Jesus would want you to do if he was here."
1,More Fundamentalist/Right Wing Bigotry,Well what can I say? Just more fodder for hatred in a world too full of it now.
1,Intolerance & Ignorance,"For each person who read this book I'd like them to pick up a copy of Vivianne Crowley's, A Woman's Guide to the Earth Traditions. Unlike the text contained in this book,Crowley's examination of a host of spiritual paths promotes tolerance and understanding, not blind hatred.As she herself notes, killing, maiming or despising another human being simply because their concept of the Divine doesn't look quite the same as yours, is ludicrous!To dispute the religion of anotheris the mark of a narrow mindO Lord! O Magician!With whatsoever faith or feeling we call on Thee,Thou art pleasedI suggest you stop saving souls already and listen a little more clearly to what the Creator is trying to tell you. It is pure arrogance to think you and only you know how everyone in the world should approach spirituality."
4,a nice new way to learn dutch,"this delftse methode is quite a decent method to learn a new language, naturally i recommend this book along with other books to achieve the most when learning a language. the book is full of 45 lessons each about a page long and unknown words are italized with their meaning listed on the next page. this book also has some words in parenthesis showing alternate words meaning the same thing which i find extremely helpful. after each lessons reading exercise there is a fill in section where you fill in missing words in what you previously read. there are also questions making sure the text is understood along with more 'fill-in-the-correct-word' exercises. i believe the book comes with a tape or cd with someone reading each lesson, the copy i have doesnt come with a cd or tape so im not sure about how the voice sounds or anything."
5,Funk-Shun,"This is a great collection for the blues fan, that really showcases Albert King's talents! My only wish would be that the songs were longer, but this is the way they were recorded and still worth their weight in the funk-shun of the blues! Magic!"
5,Definitive Albert King,This is the CD that has the music for which Albert King is best known. Great choice if all you want is one Albert King CD with the music for which he's known and that you're most likely to know.
5,Blues Guitar at its finest.,Albert King plays a great guitar. Wonderful to listen to. Each note is full of bluesy emotion. Can't go wrong with this purchase.
5,king of the funk guitar.,this album shows that albert king is the king of funk guitar. 'thursday night in san francisco' shows that albert king is the king of blues guitar. both cds are awesome.
5,King of the Blues Guitar,"This is my absolute favorite recording by Albert King. I had the album for years and literally wore it out playing it. I finally got the CD to replace my album and was pleasantly surprised to find it included some additional material not on the LP. Any collection of blues material is not complete without this.Albert King's ""Personal Manager"" is one of the best examples of why he was such a genious. The soft, syncopated piano, the delayed introduction of horns, the gradual build of energy in his voice and the blazing guitar lead send chills up my spine. I love this CD."
4,The best kept secret in blues,"Many blues fans have been disappointed because Albert King's classic ""Born under a bad sign"" album was only available as a high=priced (and now-out-of-print) gold audiophile disc. What many don't realize is that EVERY TRACK from that classic disc is included on this ""best of"" CD (but in a different order). It even includes a few bonus tracks. If you've longed for the best of Albert King look no further. It's here, baby!"
4,Good book.,"I thought this was a great book on Radohead. I mean what do you want, a whole thesis on a band. The book did what it was meant to do. I can't wait when Hysteria and Uselesness is out. That should be as good, if not better."
3,"Good for novice fans, but written like a long college essay.","It's a lot of interviews gathered together that is informative, but mostly reads like a college essay that's over 125 pages long. It's cool, as I read through it, but if I was an interviewer and book writer, I'd ask what each song means, why Colin chose such short, brilliant bass lines for AIRBAG, why Jonny and Ed made JUST so heavy over Thom's acoustic guitar; etc. I am esp. happy the writer is such a HUGE fan."
3,3 stars,"This book was pretty good...except in the part where all the songs are discussed, the author put in his own opinion about the ones he likes and doesn't like, and as I understand it, that is not supposed to be the point. For example: he writes that ""Many fans..were a little disappointed"" that Electioneering was included on OK Computer. WHAT?!?!?! I, for one, could not imagine OK Computer without it. And there are many other examples, not on every song but on a lot of them."
4,Elton John as the Band,"Tumbleweed Connection is likely the least popular LP from EJ's pop period. No hit songs,no ""Your Song"" no eager to please like his next 100 lps. This is the only one to own...it has Randy Newman wit + the Band's ideal of American music in an time forgotten and ..really , honestly never was.It's like Waltons TV show fake nostalgia written well for those who didn't live through it.Nevertheless!Fine songs and esp. sounds good in 5.1The separation of winds and bass is great on each speakerThe vocals remain centered and consistentThis is a fun 5.1 to own"
5,SACD 5.1,"Always a fan of Tumbleweed Connection, I really don't see the need to discuss the songs on this album in detail, those who have heard this album know it's one of John's most creditable works.As for the 5.1 remastering on this album, John has set the blueprint for what a 5.1 SACD should be. It is simply amazing. Perfect separation without being gimmicky. While other 5.1 mixes may simply use the rear channels for echo or effect, John perfectly places instruments in each giving a true surround sound effect. Never one of my favorite songs, Love Song takes on new clarity, with Duncan's vocals soaring. The only time the 5.1 mix seems a bit gimmicky is Ronson's guitar work on Madman. But that said, it does truly show what can be done with 5.1and to those not familiar with John's early work, recalls a time when John could truly rock. As my wife said after hearing Madman, I have new respect for Elton. This CD truly shows the potential for SACD 5.1 when in the right hands."
5,Excellant 5.1 Mix and Engineering,This SACD in 5.1 multichannel is very well mixed and mastered.I use to own the LP and played the heck out of it but with themultichannel SACD it sounds like you are there in the studio!The sounds that were faint in the background come right out andElton`s voice punches through the center speaker as if he isright there at the microphone. This SACD in multichannel not only has excellant sound but it has feeling and it is an experience which is not usually associated with cd`s.If you like Elton John and want one of the best sounding SACD`s in multichannel then this should be in your SACD player.
2,"Good, but it's the same as Seven Wheels of Light","I like this CD. However, having just discovered Joel Andrews, I purchased this CD as well as Seven Wheels of Light thinking they were two different CDs. The songs are all EXACTLY the same except with different names. There was nothing in the product description that indicated this and it was extremely disappointing to discover. I felt like I'd been duped. :("
3,Disappointed,"I found the first fourteen chapters intriguing but then somehow oddly enough my enthusiam waned as I languished toward the PREDICTABLE end of the book. The references to food at first were cute and refreshing but after a while got tiring and boring. The protagonist's bitter dialogue dragged on and on, it seemed, forever. This book is not bad for a new writer. Though, I do admit with all of the positive reviews I read before purchasing the book and hearing the author in person at the San Francisco Public Library reading an excerpt of the book, I expected a better read."
4,"Funny anime, not for everyone","This is a very ""anime"" anime, with exaggerated artwork, lots of yelling, sometimes disconnected story. That said, our entire family couldn't wait for this issuance of the end of the story. MUST see Part 1 first--it won't make any sense otherwise."
5,Hilarious,"If you haven't watched this yet - do it now! This anime is roll-on-the-floor-laugh-out-loud funny. The plot is interesting, and the characters are great. The English dub is well done, making it a pleasure to watch in either language. I highly recommend it to any and all anime fans looking for a laugh."
5,I WANT MORE!,"THIS CD IS SO GOOD THAT IT PISSES ME OFF. I WANT MORE SONGS DAMNIT!! I'VE EVEN DOWNLOADED THEIR UNRELEASED TRACK ON ITUNES CALLED ""HINDSIGHT."" THE VOCALS AND GUITARS STAND OUT THE MOST TO ME AS JUST MORE THAN AMAZING. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS BAND LIVE BECAUSE THEY'VE IMPRESSED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER ALBUM I'VE PICKED UP IN THE PAST 2 YEARS."
5,Best Album of the Year,"I just came accross this band randomly a week ago online. I checked out their purevolume page and listened to the tracks and realized within 10 seconds that this band is nothing like anything else out there and that I NEEDED to have this album. They are amazing in so many ways. Unmistable vocals, Christian is a legend waiting to happen. The music as a whole is flawless. I love every track. Every single track is perfection."
3,Bedlight For Blueeyes - The Dawn,"The bass player on this album, Justin Ortiz was the bass player in two bands with me - the product of control and Imbroglio. When he got the record deal it was awesome, it was like someone from the band made it, and I was vicariously enjoying his sucess from a distance. He left the band after one tour.First off, this band is tight. They got a great singer in Christian (who was trained at the Boston Conservatory of Music) with amazing pipes and stage presence. Unfortunately, he also has the ego to match his skills and talent, and was eventually booted from the band.As of right now, there are only two of the original members left.This album was well done, with my favorite being ""Leaving Berkeley Heights."" Unfortunately, I think Christian's lyrical ability is a little high brow and fantastical to make any real impact.You can check out Justin Ortiz's solo project (Boy Vs. Ghost) at myspace.com/boyvsghost."
2,Gameboy advance light,Light really didn't light up the screen on the gameboy. Haven't used it because it just better to sit near a lamp or sunny window.
2,What a salesman!,"He sold me a $2.00 pamphlet for $10.95 + shipping!Patrick Davis may be the greatest saleman alive! I thought cars had a big mark-up. Instead of getting 30% of the profit on a car, he gets 4000% profit on this pamphlet. It must have taken 3 hours to write this ""book?"" in between car deals. Took 45 minutes to read.If you purchase it, don't say you weren't warned!"
2,"Pretentious, little info, bad grammar","A tiny book -- 96 pages, counting every one, each with fewer than 50 words, so about equal to three type-written pages. The book is rife with non-sequitors, incomplete thoughts, and contradictions. It's a bit of a marvel, really. A good subtitle might be ""How to get customers off the lot ASAP -- without making a sale."" So why two stars instead of one? Because some of the advice, carefully separated from the rest, is sound. However, if you don't already know quite a lot about what makes customers tick, I'm unsure how you'll separate the good bits from the bad. There are better articles all over the web for free, built on arguments that make sense and are internally consistent. They can't all be correct of course, except in the sense that we each learn a different way to sell effectively. But, if you try to follow Mr. Davis's advice, all of it, you'll be tongue-tied and tripping over your own feet. The customers won't notice: they'll already have left."
1,First grade reader,This book was more like a first grade reader!! I was very disappointed in the book!! You should order another book and not this one!!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Only basic info you can learn at any dealership with a poor training program. Save your money. This book has very little value. I threw my copy away. A good training book is Cars and People, How to put the two together by Anthony Ziegler. MJV @Simpson Auto"
1,Why do the 5 star reviews all have the same bad spelling?,"I haven't read this book and I probably never will. The only ""good"" reviews are obviously written by the same person. A person who doesn't know how to spell some pretty basic words. I hope it's not the author...it might explain some things though."
5,Exactly What I Needed,After searching long and hard at last a no Non sense book with step by step insturctions on how to sell cars. I am a much better sales person for having read this book. I would like to thank the author for his help. And say I hope he writes more.
5,I Could Not imagine a better book on the subject!,"I recently got into the car business i have sold two cars in two days. I follow the principles outlined in the book and my manager says I am doing very well and he is sure I will succeed in this business. I work hard however, I have also gotten the training I need."
5,Easy Read,Patrick has a style that ius straight forward and to the point. His easy to understand verbage gives even the novice a feel for the car business that leaves them feeling confident in their ability to go out and get the job done
5,Excellent,"This book is just what the Amazon description said it would be. Not only was it quick and to the point, the ideas I have learned are helping me to be more successful. The author did not waste a single word. The book only took about 45 minutes to read and each page is worth memorizing. I am using the techniques everyday and am dong better because of the valuable information I have learned."
5,Best Book On Selling Cars,"This is a well written, easy read. Davis sets the mark for how to sell cars (to women or any other group). THIS IS THE BOOK TO READOthers have tried to copy his methods, style and ideas, but DAVIS is the original."
1,Can I give less than a star?,"You must be joking! I'm reading these prior reviews, and they are so one-sided for or against this title. I went ahead and bought it along with another title on ""How to Put the Two Together"" thinking at least one of these two books should have something to help me improve. This one ""book"" I must say is a complete waste of money. Am I missing something here?"
1,Ouch! Waste of money. Simple and Poorly Put Together.,"I have not been in the business very long. I did buy a handful of books hoping to learn what I needed to know. It seemed that I was not getting the whole picture with my managers and team mates, they made strange statements that had no use for me as a salesperson. This book is like their statements; useless. It says the same things. Maybe there are a bunch of cliches' in the car business that people refer to as training. I think this is true, because almost every other book I read has the same useless information. I did find one book that is well worth the cost of all these other books combined (which is what I had to pay to find it) Try ""Cars and People: How to Put The Two Together"" if you want something that works, is clear and concise. This book? Leave on the shelf."
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good book and because of the negative comments by S. Scotty Davis (who is pushing Ziegler's book by demeaning every other car sales book on here) I bought this one and ""Automobile Sales Training and Tips From The Pros"". by Douglas Hensley. Both books have a lot of good stuff in them. I have been in the car busines for 20 years and I like both the books I just mentioned."
2,[...],I have gone through about 2 weeks of pitiful training in car sales at 2 different dealerships. Both training sessions were almost identical - very brief and basic. Guess what - this book is just what I learned. The book is VERY brief and very basic. I was looking for something innovative and new. I didn't get that. [...]
3,Too basic,This is a great book for a greenpea. But if you have been in carsale for more than six months you should know everything mentioned.
1,Very light on material,I guess I was expecting a lot more ... before I bought this book. The book was far too basic for me and seemed to do nothing but reveal the obvious. I don't think I learned anything I didn't already know.
2,BLAND & BASIC,"Everything Patrick Davis teaches in this book you learn at the sales training course allmost all dealerships have. This book as many other people rating this book have written is very, very, basic. The modern auto sales floor & selling process is much more complicated than Mr. Davis leads readers to believe."
3,A Cat Named Elton,"After the sprawling sounds of his first four albums, Honky Chateau finds Elton John moving in a more commercial direction. The songs are shorter and punchier. While this produced one his most enduring songs, ""Rocket Man"", it doesn't always work. ""Rocket Man"" is a certified pop classic and has become so identifiable with Mr. John that it has become an appellation of his. ""Honky Cat"" lives up to its name with its honky tonk keyboards. ""Mona Lisa & Mad Hatters"" is nice ballad and ""Hercules"" is a spry rocker that closes out the album. The rest of the album is spotty with songs like ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"", ""Mellow"" and ""Susie (Dramas)"" being misses. The change to a more commercial direction was a wise though as Honky Chateau became Elton John's first number one album and started an incredible streak of seven consecutive number one albums."
5,SACD 5.1 is awesome,"If you know Elton John's music (and who doesn't), then you know this albumn, or at least the hits. And, you know that the songs contained on this album are great. What you might not know is the 5.1 surround arrangement done on this SACD. It is fantastic. Everyone needs to run out and get an SACD compatible player (preferably one which also plays DVD-A's as well) and then get this or any of the other Elton John's SACD's. They are all wonderfully produced, and really open up these songs to another level entirely. You will be amazed."
3,Shuffle off to get this series.,"Shuffle is a fairly standard harem comedy that is not ground breaking, yet is rather entertaining nontheless. It has decent characters and a rather good plotline."
4,Wonderful item (But...),"Boursin - Garlic and Fine Herbs - great taste our favorite spread with fine crackers. We have been served this in high end hotels several times and wanted to have some at home too. The only ""watch out"" is our order was almost out-of-date when we received it. We still enjoyed it, BUT...had to eat it fast. IF the out-of-date was reasonable this item would have received 5 stars!"
2,Expiration date,I received the product very promptly and packed in a little cooler but the expiration date was 9/30/08 and I had just ordered it 9/22/08. They need to watch that my husband wont eat anything out of date or even close to being out of date. That was the only complaint. Love the cheese!!!
1,"this is a pattern, not a book!","This item is misdescribed as a book. It isn't, it's simply a pattern with some extra directions. It makes the ""heart"" piece shown on the cover, and that is it. I wanted directions that would teach me the skill of paper piecing, not a single how-to pattern. This is going back ASAP."
3,How to Paper Piece,The book was nice and quite informative. It is a little below my ability level so I was disappointed that there was only one pattern in the book. I can pass it along and share with a new quilter.
3,Good Reference,"This is not the most interesting read in the world, but it contains good information. If you have an import business, this is a must have for your reference library."
5,CLASSIC,"Many have said this is the best ""study"" bible ever. I agree. I now own one for my office and my home as well as one for each of my kids and my wife. This is a terrific resource with a real dictionary, topical study helps, many notes before and after the chapters and much more. I especially like that the helps aren't mixed in with the text. You need this help."
1,crude quality,I have never purchased a Minicraft model before and I wish I hadn't bought this one. I is a very crude model. The engine is one blog of plastic. If it had cost 10 dollars that would have been a more realistic price for it. At best it is a beginner model.
4,The most detailed book ever written on the golf swing.,"This book is strictly for those who want to know how and why the golf swing performs. It is not based on personal opinion, nor personal ""theory"". It is based on years of collected facts, and based on the laws of physics and geometry. It is not intended for the casual reader---it is extremely detail oriented and difficult to follow. However, its contents are a true treasure. If you're tired of the endless sea of instructional material based on one man's opinion, this book reveals how and why the golf swing functions."
2,Complicated,"Its a very technic book, i,m a profesional golf and this book is complicated to understand, its very dificult to use, but the golf téchnic is not bad"
5,Highly technical,"The Golfing Machine provides substantiated input for the true golfer.Not only fundamentals, but also various perspectives with cross references.Not something for the fainthearted to read during a late afternoon.Contends requires full attention and concentrated in depth reading.The information provided substantiates Ben Hogan's Five Lessons as well as Bobby Clampett's The Impact Zone."
3,Takes a lot of patience to work through,"Kelley claimed this book is a textbook, and is written in the corresponding style. Well, it is somewhat like a textbook, but the organization of the material is needlessly arbitrary, and the keys to productive study are inadequate. However, it contains a report of an exhausitive and insightful study of the golf swing and all realistic variations. I wish one of the Authorized Instructors would write a guide to study. That would be helpful."
1,"Difficult read, and odd writing style","I found this book to be very difficult to read and follow. The terminology is different from any other instruction books I have read, and does not flow in any logical fashion. I had heard so many good things about it that I have tried going through it multiple times. Yes, I did read it in the recommended fashion from page 10.I can honestly say that after investing multiple reads, and many hours in it that this book provides nothing other then confusion. The concepts may be good, who could know? This book calls out for a re-write by someone who understands the concepts, and has developed a writing style that would convey it.Obviously not on my recommendation list."
1,Gnostic nonsense,Unnecessarily confusing. The bit about it being a enginerring semantics is a load of crap. Its written in a confusing manner and uses references to other sections of the book which are as equally as confusing as the first part. Save your money and buy the Bobby Clampett Impact zone book
1,Lots of Information - poorly written,"Ths book contains lots of information about what 'ought to' happen in order to make a good golf swing. However, the writing style is so ungrammatical as to make the information inaccessible to me. I had to focus so hard on reading the words that I was unable to grasp the essential concepts that Kelly is trying to get across."
2,Missing piece,"When I got this, it had a piece missing! How do they expect the thing to stay on w/ no ball on the end. I don't recommend it.."
4,Great for fans,"Probably the best collection of the Original movies out there. The Re-make is obviously not included in the set. Mine is excellent other than the fact it's missing one of the pairs of 3-d glasses, that's fine especially since I bought a used set and that is the only issue."
5,All the movies in ONE package!,What a deal! All the movies on DVD!It's really taking awhile to watch them all but they are great quality! This was a wonderful gift for my boyfriend. I haven't seen them all and now we can watch them all in order!Such a good price too!
4,"1, 2 Freddy's Coming For You....","Here is the greatest thing for Freddy Krueger fans. This is a box with the 7 movies of the series plus a bonus DVD with a bunch of special bonus. On each DVD there are great trivias in the DVD-Rom features, great sound and captions... If you like this series, it's really worth buying. I don't have to warn you that the movies are violent, blood, sex, guts and this kind of thing, but it's fine, anyway. One of the coolest things is that there are a couple of Nightmare On Elm Street 3D glasses (you use them to see the 6th movie ending). And a booklet full of pictures and cool texts. The only reason I dont give this a maximum rating is the fact that the DVD-Rom features doesn't work on iMac... Buy it anyway. Great fun! Lock your doors, grab a crucifix and.. DO NOT SLEEP!"
5,Yay! Nightmares!!,"The socks have been sufficiently scared off of me! Now my feet are cold, and i cant find the darn socks!! Thanks!!"
5,A Gift For Fans,Absolutely everything you ever wanted (or needed) to know about the Elm Street series. This set is truly a gift for the folks who grew up in the eighties enjoying the exploits of Freddy Krueger. This collection touches on everything and more! So much info that it almost gets embarrassing at times! The extras dvd is worth the price alone! Hours of entertainment here.
3,a nightmare of sequals,The first and seventh addition to the series is the best. I give them 5 stars. But all the others sucked. Horrible. There shoulda just been A Nightmare on Elm Street then Wes Cravens New Nightmare to celebrite its 10th anniversary. Thats all they needed.Only get this boxx setif ur desperate to see the death of millions and millions of stupid teenagers. Its so corny and lame.A nightmare on elm street (1984) 5 starsWes Cravens New Nightmare (1994) 5 stars
2,The 1st one is awesome but the rest kind of suck,"1: The first Nightmare on elm street is the only one worth buying besides maybe 3. Heather Langenkamp is perfect for her role, she is the sexiest thing...to bad you don't see her naked in this one.2: Makes no sense. This one doesn't follow the plot of #1 and people die before you get to know who they are. No build up at all, and definetly not scary.3: The only good one besides the original. Heather is back (thank god) but once again, you don't see her naked.4:embarrasing5:also embarrasing6: kind of scary but embarrasing7: This is the worst one...Even though Heather/Nancy is back, for some reason. This movie sucks, it is actually okay up until the very end when Heather reads off the book that says that the last six films were all fake. Wes Craven is smart, but sometimes he is a complete dumbass."
1,the worst horror series of all time,I will not buy this piece of crap. Not even for free could I want this box. Here's what I think about all 7 movies....nightmare on elm street - boring and dull 1 starnightmare on elm street 2 - dull and just plain dumb 1 starnightmare on elm street 3 - DULL 1 starnightmare on elm street 4 - not scary nor good 1 starnightmare on elm street 5 - BORING!!! 1 starnightmare on elm street 6 - Stupid and lame 1 starnightmare on elm street 7 - LAME!! 1 starHow can anyone like these movies. They're not scary nor good or fun to watch. Please take this box and blow it up and never ever talk about it again. If you want good horror see Jason X or The Haunting. This should be a comedy folks. The acting is lame and the special effects are so damm bad and cheesy. There is no plot so why keep seeing them?? I don't know what so special about nightmare on elm street. It should be renamed into Comedy on elm street.
5,One of the best horror boxsets available,"All the nightmare films, spooky packageing, awesome bonus disc, what more could you want??!"
5,I LOVE THIS PACKAGE,"Freddy is one of the most Know Villain in the world, I thing everyone knows about this guy. This package bring to you every movie and one extra DVD with all the special feature, incredible, the Freddys Dead bring to you the 3D special effects (and one pair of glasses), all the movies except the 2 (freddys revenge), are very good movies, and if you want to buy a Horror Film, this is best package you can buy, because have 8 DVD, for 90$, like 11$ for DVD, and you have the seven film and one extra DVD full of special feature. I recomend you this package I LOVE IT."
5,Great Collector's Set!,"This was a great set. I got it for Christmas and I still love it. All of these movies are very fun to watch and the bonus disc is awesome. If you love this series, then this set will be worth your money."
5,this collection rulez!,"this is the best set of dvd's ever. The extra features are outstanding. The first nightmare beats all of them though. while the funny freddy is cool its better to have the dark freddy. dont even waste your time though with nightmare 2 the sound, picture, and the movie itself is worse then dumb. The best part of this collection is the extra dvd that has really cool stuff. back when I was little I was being baby-sat by my cousin she liked to watch MTV, when she went to the bathroom freddy kruger came on, that was the first time i ever saw freddy kruger. After I bought this set and put in the extra dvd i had no idea that i was going to see that freddy MTV thing. This set will coast you alot but you will never once ask yourself why you bought this."
4,Absolutely love it but I'm a bit puzzled,"I saw princeob's review and I also received a double-sided disc which was the first disc in the package but it does play the 1st Nightmare on Elm street with Johnny Depp but it doesn't play Freddy Vs. Jason. 0_0 The disc is also blank there isn't any picture on it. I have yet to see all of them but I was worried about the 1st movie so I checked that one out. It's definitely a good buy if you love the whole ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies."
3,third movie was switched out with first!,Everything was fine but were i was to get the third movie i received a copy of the first movie!
3,I enjoy the movie.,My movie came on time and was well packaged. there are no scratches on any of the disks everything is fine.
2,Pointless,"Lets see here, ya got one great film (the original), one very good film (New Nightmare), one decent film, (Dream Warriors), and 4 films that suck. And I mean suck in a bad way. The crappier 'Friday the 13th' sequels are still amusing but the 'Nightmare' sequels grow quite tiresome. The verdict: Don't buy this. Just get the 2 good ones individually, and maybe, maybe the third one."
1,Can't say...,I can't really write a review for this because I don't own it. I purchased it via fulfillment through Amazon and the product arrived damaged to me and so I had to send it back for a refund. Was very disappointed.
3,nightmare on elm street collection,"I thought it was a great deal ,however when I recieved it , freddys dead was not in it ,it has two of the same bonus disks instead, and for me to buy the missing one will be almost the price of the whole set...With that aside the disks that were in it all play very well and I recieved them very fast..... Thanks !!"
5,1...2...Freddy's coming for you...,If your a fan of Freddy Krueger then this is the set to get. If only it included Freddy vs. Jason but other than that it's well worth the money for the 9 dvds.
5,Simply Thrilling,"Talk about good old fashion Horror Flicks. After so many years have passed, I still get chills up my spine seeing this classics."
5,For a true fan,this is the best collection for any Nightmare on elm st fan!! If your really a part of the elm st children you have to get this!
1,My one star isn't for the movies themselves,"I wish they would re-release the 8 disc DVD set in Blu-ray format, or at least give each movie in the franchise it's own disc! Its a timeless american cult classic. This franchise made New Line Cinema a lot of money... They should spend some money in return and give it the upgrade to Blu-Ray it deserves! It would sell better!"
5,Perfect box set for a great series,"Every horror movie fan just HAS to own this awesome box set of Freddy madness. My only grievances? Part 5 & 6 and the irritating to navigate bonus disc. At least they included the 3D sequence from ""Freddy's Dead"" (Take note PARAMOUNT for your upcoming Friday the 13th box set!!!)The commentaries, the extras and the quality of the DVDs are awesome. You have to own it.Freddy's baaaack."
1,No More Horror for Me,I dont watch horror movies any more. Anything that grieves the Holy Spirit is not worth my time or energy. I only want to glorify the Lord and this series definitely doesnt do that.
4,"Great Movies, But Not Great DVDs!","First of all I love the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The movies did not disappoint me, but the special features did. It seemed like there were no special features to any of the movies and the ones that are on the CDs were made up after the movies had been produced and this concept of having special features on DVDs became popular. If you are a fan of the Freddy movies I definitely recommend this movie collection, but you may be disappointed at the special features."
2,Not Happy!,"Just got my shipment in today, and was stoked that it got here in such a short time. However, when I got it open I found out that this ""NEW"" item was absent the first disc and in it's place was a double feature disc of the 7th and 8th movies. Not to mention there were smudges all over the disc."
5,Never Sleep Again!,I've always been a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series since I was younger. This includes all the movies that matter not including the Freddy Vs. Jason crap. I wouldn't mind having this on Blu-Ray though.
5,Excellent box set,I got this box set to upgrade my vhs box set that came out at the same time as this box set several years ago. If your a freddy fan your going to love it. Comes with the nightmare encyclopedia which ppl love i havent seen it yet though.all in all great box set ill be picking up the blue ray one soon.
5,There's nothing else left to say...,"... but I'll go for it anyway. I completely agree with the many reviewers who proclaim this collection as the best DVD boxed set available. While I don't really care as much for part 5 or 6, the first four films are absolute classics (yes, even the underappreciated second film), and New Nightmare is decent. The original A Nightmare on Elm Street ranks among the greatest horror films ever made, and Freddy is a horror icon without peer. The extra disc is packed with extra material, and the interactive labrynth is a very cool idea. They don't make 'em like this anymore!"
5,One two Freddy's coming for you,"There is no horror villain cooler than Freddy Kruger. Although as the movies went on, Freddy said the ""B"" word too many times for me but still loved him."
4,Good set,"This set would've gotten a 5 star rating from me if they dropped every movie after part 2.That would've been much better.Robert Englund did great in every part but after part 2, the series just wasn't the same.Hey, if you want a really good movie, check out 'The Mangler.'It's about this really scary factory machine that starts eating people. Much scarier than a knife glove wearing dream maker!!!Actually, if you ever saw the Mangler... I'm very sorry."
1,Triple Dipped,"Unless the original Nightmare on Elm Street box set is going out of print then don't bother with this set. No improvements on this set but comes out in time to cash in on the remake of the original Nightmare on Elm Street. It takes out the Nightmare Encyclopedia, which is well worth checking out, and replaces it with the subpar Freddy VS Jason. Didn't they just re-release these movies in a four pack anyways? Save your money and either buy the 4 Film Favorites dvds which includes all 8 films but way cheaper (and probably what this set consist of) or buy the original set for basically the same price and get the cool Nightmare Encyclopeida, it's your money."
4,Great set but mine had 2 of the same disc instead of New Nightmare,I was very satisfied to watch all of the movies in this collection until I got to New Nightmare. I opened it and put it in without even glancing at the dvd. It was the Enclopedia bonus featurette disc on the screen instead of the movie! I immediately looked in that disc's case to see if I had put in the wrong one and I hadn't. I had two of the same dvds and no New Nightmare! I was so disappointed and ended up buying New Nightmare from Amazon by itself a few months later.
5,Elementary reader,"This was my reading book in school, and I still remembered it after all these years. As a tutor, I'm horrified at the reading materials available in schools, so I purchased this to loan out to my students. It's similar to the Little House books and tells the account of the settling of Hasting Mills, IL (now Aurora). Lots of interesting pictures that remind me of H.C. Holling illustrations."
1,"Won,t Fit","Easy to install and looked good on my vehicle, only problem was my hood would not lock down , had to remove to close hood properly , have 08 jeep grand cherokee . I am sure that it works fine on other vehicles just not mine."
5,Dimango wireless remote control,This unit performs very good. I like the fact that it is weatherproof.
3,For Extreme Graham Nash Fans Only,"As a response to all the rave reviews, I found Wild Tales okay and pleasant, but not essential. If you have to buy one Graham Nash album, stick with Songs for Beginners which has at least 4 classic songs.Because of similar musicians, Wild Tales is like Neil Young's Harvest without Neil's songwriting, guitar or voice. It is also 31 minutes long. With filler, you end up with 15 - 20 minutes of good music.Atlantic should reissue this combined with the 30 minutes of Songs For Beginners as one CD (as was done with Big Star's first two albums). Then it would be worth it. If you need to have every recording of CSN&Y; (together and solo) up to 1973, then buy this, but buy it last."
4,A superb yet overlooked album.,"An enchanting album. Simple yet mesmerizing songs, with indeed outstanding cuts such as ""And so it goes"" and ""Another sleep song"". A bit too mellow perhaps at times, but not in the context of the early seventies. A very intimate experience overall. Graham, if you read this, you should know I grew up in... Lebanon, listening, playing and singing this album with my friends... Thank you!"
4,Early 70's populist song politics with cool harmonies,"I'll admit up front that I'm an unabashed fan of the 70's Southern California singer songwriter style. Jackson Browne, CSN, Dan Fogelberg are all just fine with me. Having said that, this album has many strong songs but is uneven. Graham has a tendency to be a bit too mellow. Still the stand out cuts, ""And So It Goes"", ""Another Sleep Song"", ""Wild Tales"" make up for the few downers here. This would most likely be enjoyed by a true Graham Nash fan and not those with just a passing interest. Great sidemen and special guests by the way."
4,The Importance of Beng Ernest,"Graham Nash sings and writes songs on this CD with heartfelt conviction. However, it's hard not to compare this CD with his first, ""Songs for Beginners,"" a much more interesting and melodic CD. The songs on ""Wild Tales"" seem too simiple, little ditties that really never move you, except for the song that continues from his first CD, ""Another Sleep Song,"" with Joni Mitchell adding airy resonance to this beautiful love song.Unfortunately, the songs on ""Wild Tales"" have little to capture your repeated listening after one or two times. Stick with Graham's first is my advice."
5,Graham Nash....It's all good!,"I have purchased most of Graham's work. Wild tales is another example of his great work. I love Graham in that in his musical career, he still sings and and writes music to help support causes that support a healthy world. Love You Graham! Keep up your superb work. Wild tales is great."
5,Great Snack!,"My kids love these crackers. They are a great snack. The larger (12 oz.) boxes are harder too find, and are a better deal."
3,For Completists Only,"The 3-star rating is not regarding the actual songs presented on this disc, but for the product itself. This is a chronologically laid out sampler and nothing more. The only attraction for existing fans of Zakk Wylde/BLS are the last three acoustic tracks. Stillborn is one of my favorite BLS songs and I believe the acoustic version presented here was only available on a DVD."
2,BLS please come back!,"Yet another Greatest Hits compilation by Zakk and his crew?? Why? We were damaged enough by Shot to Hell and how much of a mediocre album that was when you compare it to the first three albums in the BLS collection, but this is not the kind of album you follow up Shot to Hell with. We've all heard these songs before and we've probably downloaded all the ""acoustic"" versions of Stillborn that there is out there. Why not come out with some new material to re-energize the fanbase??I think BLS is a victim of their commercial success what with their merchandising and all that. It's practically a brand name and the BLS letters have more hype behind them than actual substance. As a die-hard fan, I feel that the last 5 or 6 years of BLS have been a letdown musically and we've been suckered into the image of BLS rather than what made us fans of them in the first place. Great albums like Sonic Brew and Stronger Than Death. Please, Zakk. Put out another Metal album before you hang it up!"
5,awsome cd a must have for any metal head,black label society rock the hell out of this album but dont they always.Get this cd and u will listen to it over and over again
3,Could've been better,"I would recommend doom troopin' highly over this d.v.d. It does have some of the same footage,however not as much. The video for ""in this river"" is great though."
2,VEEEERRRY TIRED,"Another sleeper from Zakk and crew. This must have been done in his garage-the sound is of that quality. BLS must be out of beer money or something. Not as dissappointing as ""Shot to Hell"" but almost.just a hadgepodge of studio outtakes. I am an avid BLS fan and this CD was mediocre at best. No new material at all,except for the accoustic stuff which was the only reason I gave it two stars. BLS was,like ""Shot..."",clutching at straws with this one.Just like the movie cop says:""Move along folks,nothing to see here.""Save yer money for a REAL BLS attempt at an album."
2,Backyard camping only,"NOT KELTY they just use the word in the name.We purchased this last summer through a major wholesale club. The price is great but the product is very poor. We returned it and another by the same makerPros Very Cheap, big tent, some head room in the center, can be setup by one person (hard). Fun shape that could work for groups.ConsZips are cheap, weak, and jam easy. The flooring is very thin and while the shape is fun it will not fit on many campsites,Seams rip easy, no floor in the screen area. Very small rain fly, Overall this tent seems poorly made.Note: this tent is NOT made by Kelty, they just use the name under some deal.In the end we got the ""Cougar flats"" tent, and that is fine/good ( although the hype is way over the top)I suggest walk away and do not touch anything this company makes.....UNLESS you just want a no rain tent that has to fit a lot of people, and is cheap."
4,This tent does a good job!,I have used this tent for many years and it has held up fine in rain and heavy wind (50mph gusts). I admit that the rain fly is a bit small and that if I camped under windy and rainy conditions then I'd have problems so it definitely is a 3 season tent. I have heard or read about broken poles and torn seams with this tent and feel that it would never have happened with a little care and TLC when putting it up as I never have had those problems. I especially love the screenroom as I can sit out late while my boys are inside asleep.
3,OK,Purchased at Costco. Tent is great until it rips and poles snap on a windy day. Getting ready to contact company for support and replacement parts. Guess ultimate review will depend on customer service and support.
2,"A shadow of the first one, but still a great band","If you're thinking of buying your first Manassas album, by all means skip this one and pick up the self-titled album that came before it. If you were blown away by the first one -- rightly! -- and are hoping this is more of the same, take your expectations down a couple of notches and enjoy the same basic sound deployed in the service of a much inferior set of songs. If you could pinpoint where Stills lost his genius, it's somewhere between Manassas and Down the Road. There are a couple of lovely songs in Spanish here, and this band had Latin-inflected chops to spare, but there's a wasted weariness to the whole affair, as if the band had spent too many nights in the hotel bar snorting the lint out of Joe Walsh's pockets. For completists only."
2,What went wrong?,"Steve Silberman (below) got it exactly right. Stills ""lost"" his genius between the first Manassas record (still fresh and exciting after all these years) and this one. Admittedly, upon listening to it in '99 for the first time in over 20 years, it was a little better than I remembered it. ""Pensamiento"" is good, as are the acoustic ""So Many Times"" and ""Do You Remember the Americans?"" But the rockers are way sub-par, and the overall feel is of the air having gone out of a beautiful balloon."
4,ok maybe 3 and half stars,"This poor record got unfairly lost in the shuffle of CSN, solo Stills releases....and unfairly compared with Manassas first brillant record.....this one is pretty damned good too......more of the same, and more songs from Hillman....Stills lets more of the band shine on this one......and who doesn't like Joe Walsh playin' slide on a track!So if you like Stills, or Hillman (burrito/byrds sound) and you liked the first Manassas record........go for this one.....its better than Stills later 70's stuff like Illegal Stills and Stills and right by you. Enjoy it and don't think to hard just enjoy."
5,Good Music is Good Music,"Steve Stills .. More Manassas ... If you like the first one, you better buy this and Pieces."
1,Pitiful,"I am a major Stills fan. I think the first Manasas album was a true classic! I decided to give this one a try even though I skipped it years ago when it first came out having heard bad things and by that time I was a bit burned out on this type of music. I wish I had skipped it this time around. The entire project seems thrown together like as if Stills and the boys were forced under contract to put something, anything, down on on record. The lyrics are sophmoric, and the rest is beneath Stills to put out. Two tracks are worth hearing - Isn't It About Time and Pensamiento. The rest is filler."
2,"Misleading title, and not a great cd","First of all, when you see a title ""Down The Road"", does that not imply a ""live "" recording? It's not. It is a weak follow up to the brilliant Manassas first recording. I love Stephen Stills, and there is simply nothing special here.I never listen to it. I wish there was a live Manassas cd available.For now, I'll have to settle for ""Stephen Stills Live"", which is outstanding."
1,"FOR HIT OR MISS STILLS, ONE OF HIS WORST","There is nothing to recommend this album. The toll drugs and alcohol were taking on his skill and his ego were at their devastating worse here. The songs are terrible, the arrangements lacluster and the recording quality a real mess. If someone gives this to you, slap them with it. The masters of this should be destroyed at once."
4,An excellent basic guide to numerous self-defense responses using the Tegner system.,"Even though my formal training in the martial arts was with traditional judo, jujitsu and karate instructors; nevertheless, I have always appreciated the late Bruce Tegner's practical approach in learning the martial arts and self-defense. You can never say the techniques looked beautiful and smooth in Tegner's books, but the non-mystical and practical approach he emphasized made his books very popular with the non-martial arts community.This book has real value because it shows a great number of self-defense responses to numerous attacks. I certainly do not agree with some of the techniques; nevertheless, this is an excellent introduction to self-defense, especially if used in conjunction with training under a competent and certified self-defense instructor.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths--Cafe Press)."
5,excellent book for self defense,"This is a great book on self defense (not a martial art)... it will work for one who doesn't want to spend years trying to perfect their ""Dim Mak"" death touch. You can use this book with a partner and by oneself (I would recommend a heavy bag at least and if you have the money a ""Bob"" body opponent bag). This book has a lot in common with Fairbarn, Styles type of combatives (which is the newest old thing in self defense) also has elements from what Kelly Mccann teaches in his combatives book / videos (which I recommend also if you want a more rounded education). Tegner does teach fist blows (which is a drawback) but all the other blows are standard combative fare."
4,A Biography That Reads Like A Novel,This is a well-told biography that reads like a novel. The author traces the suspect but glamorous path that turned Maggie Fox and her sisters from ordinary Victorian women into celebrities and started the spiritualist movement. The social history is fascinating and the love letters between Maggie and her Arctic explorer are wonderful and romantic. A great biography.
1,Where's the good progressive trance?,"With all the good progressive trance being released on mix albums, you'd think you could get similar enjoyment from a non-mixed album, like this one. However, this is a pretty lame CD, with only one track (Seabird, whatever the 3rd one is) that is musically interesting. The rest sound like cheap synth tracks that were made up in the same factory that made my grandmother's old organ."
4,"Loud attention getter, impressive features!",this thing really moves. my son got it for his 2nd birthday (2 months ago) and plays with it maybe every other day for a couple minutes. He gets a big kick out of it but then moves on to other things. A good novelty item but not a classic toy in the making.
5,"While it is interesting, but I only go through 3 pages.","While because of money, I just came out from book shop and for the next budget I will buy this book.(Lifetime Encryclopedia of Letter).It is great and interesting when I readed this book and I actually try to search this book from internet hope it can download a copy from here."
2,Be careful,"The business examples are, for the most part, useful and helpful, albeit very dry and canned. The sections on personal letters, however, are simply dreadful. Completely ignore the chapter on how to write a letter of sympathy or concern; it's obvious this man has never written such a letter or if he has, he is no longer friends with the correspondent.If you choose to purchase this book, take it with a grain of salt and use your better judgement over one who has no creditials."
2,Missing most important section!,"I was going to ask my employer for a raise this Monday and resorted to the Lifetime Letters book. I could not locate a section on earnings, promotion, raise, salary, wages, pay, increase, income, or simply, MORE. Nothing!!! Nothing at all on any of those subjects. Would this not be one of the most important letters every written in one's life? If your looking for information on how to ask for a wage increase, don't bother to look here."
3,It has a CD ... but not much more.,"I bought this book because it was the only one with CD-ROM. CD has MS Word files with all letters from the book. However, when I read the letters, I was not very impressed. Most of them a very short which makes them hard to customize. It seems that author is trying to walk a fine line between being terse and being rude. Sorry for the style of this review- if I could write better, I wouldn't pay money for the book!"
3,Mediocre,"This book is mediocre. I'd expect a book on ""letter writing"" to provide examples of unusual and creative letters; letters that would catch and leave a fresh impression on the reader, but it's not the case.The professional section is OK, even though the letters are boring, dull, and predictable. The personal section is simply dreadful: tactless and unimaginative. Letters of sympathy and condolences are some of the worse ones.I'd not have bought it if I'd have taken a closer look at it.If you're already a good letter-writer, then this book is a good tool to provoke your OWN writing. If you're not, look for another guide."
3,do you really need this anymore,"It has a great collection of letters and you can use parts of letters to form your own. But now with the internet, I am not sure it is needed anymore."
2,Not GR8,"Although cleverly wri10, 'The Wicked Book of Txt Tlk' un4tune8ly perpetu8s the woeful st8 in2 which language has now 4ln . Y have we allowed the abbrevi8ed 4m 2 become the norm? Y is laziness the preferred practice? And 2 any1 who believes that we no longer need the words 'Frequently Asked Questions' because 'FAQ' is quicker & slicker, I simply say this; FA Q."
4,"Overall, it was very satifying but...","I found that the plot was unresolved, concerning Tom Burgess, that is. Who was he? How did the talisman work and what did the key on it represent? What exactly happened to him? I still have these questions lingering on my mind, and more, after I finished this book. I'm not sure if Horowitz intentionally did this and these questions will be answered in upcoming books or just a bad editing job. I hope it is the first reason. Otherwise, I loved the book. Although not as intense as the Alex Rider series, I thought they were excellent. Horowitz has now turned to a fantasy-ish/supernatural genre rather than a spy genre but I feel he still was able to make a great story, almost better, than Alex Rider. I only gave it a four star rating because of the Burgess thing, but I that doesnt stop me from not wanting to read the second book in the series, Evil Star! I highly reccomend this book!"
3,Fair read,"Overall, I thought Raven's Gate was a fair read. It was a bit darker and more dpressing than I was expecting, but I still liked it."
3,its o.k.,"this book was alright it wasnt five stars just because how every c hapter until the very end seems like it is the same. matt hears whispers he gos into the woods everytime. he finds a dead body. yeah that was realy interesting, not really. there are only two interesting parts. when he fights the skelitons in the museum and when he is using his powers for the first controlled time at the nuclear reactor. this book is too slow for a.d.d. readers who like action around every corner this book is not for you."
2,Ravens Gate,"I was just too fantastic, witout having a real background explanation, at least on rhis book, definitely not reading the next one"
2,page turner but . . .,"Yes, it was a page-turner. Horowitz knows how to make you care about the character. But be warned this is a horror novel with plenty of occult trappings. People are killed in grisly ways, there's an upside down cross, a black mass, the Lord's prayer recited backwards, child sacrifice. This is more than we're used to from this author."
3,Read Alex Rider Series instead,"This book was definatly a depression on the Anthony Horowitz books. It was too magical and it was too confusing. The Gatekeepers series is no where near as good as the Alex Rider series. I dont recomend this book to anyone who doesnt like magical and mystical books. Anthony Horowitz, for now, work on the Alex Rider series."
3,Disappointing,"Despite the theme being very dark, the violence in this book is gratuitous. Minor characters are not well developed. In the fight between good and evil, the evil ones seem to be all powerful and great in numbers and the few and far between good are either dull, stupid, or naive. Although it reads easily, I would not recommend it for under 8th grade. I certainly wouldn't compare it to any of the Harry Potter series. It's not that caliber, rather a ""wannabe""."
3,Not one of my favourites,I liked Alex rider series a lot better than ravens gate because it is a lot funnier and has more action and is not as suspenseful
5,Raven's Gate,Great book! Very exciting. Anthony Horowitz is a great author. I love his books! Can't wait to read more! Woot
5,I love this textbook!,Microeconomics by McConnell and Brue is a great text book. The explanation is very clear. I especially like the way they explain the graphs and concepts. It's very easy to understand. They give very good examples in each chapter. I use it for my class and I found the reading is very enjoyable. This textbook is definitely good for people who want to do self-study of microeconomics.
1,Possibly has bacteria.,I started having stomach problems after taking this pollen. I had to take antibiotics to cure it.
4,excellent kjv reference,"As a KJV believer, I find the book to be real helpful in getting the meaning of the words and phrases you are looking at for understanding.My only complaint is that is over-priced for a paperback. [$10 being about right] When every volume is put together, it will be a real handy reference source."
5,"Hail, Myrtle","Fantastic job! Great for kids of all ages, and their parents, too. In this age of growing waistlines and super-sized kids' meals, it's nice to see something that will help get kids off their duffs. A fun, fun book!A fellow runner from michigan"
3,Concise and for the first short trip only,It's short. A little superficial. It's definitively old fashion in terms of production. It provides with basic helpful information if you will visit for the first time (not my case). It can help you to get an appetizer of the city in a very concise portion. It's not a documentary.
2,none,did not work nothing else to say. it smelled like a buck so maybe there was none around? might try it again
2,Worked ok,"Lit one early in the rut. It smoked, and stunk, for a few hours. And that day I saw more deer activity than I've ever seen. But after that one instance (and I don't know if it was the stick, or just the early rut) I never saw another deer when these were lit."
1,Cotton swabs,"The cotton swabs are very hard to the touch, thin and not very absorbent. The sticks break off easily. If you want to use these for cleaning your ears, forget it! Not a good product.."
2,"The are not Q-TIPS, they are low quality cotton(?) swabs","I bought these ""Q-Tips"" because I thought they were Q-Tips (Johnson & Johnson's trademarked cotton swabs). This item is in fact low quality swabs. The swabs themselves may be cotton, but they are so tightly wound (and can't be unwound) that they absorb almost nothing.Other than the swabs, the product is as expected; the sticks are of good quality and the swabs come in clean paper packs of 100 swabs per pack.When I complained to the vendor, his communication was prompt and he refunded me my money."
1,Poor Quality,"I like wood stick cotton swabs because nothing compares. These are the exception. The sticks tend to break and the cotton on the end is too small to be safe. If you like inconsistent product quality, but these. Otherwise go elsewhere."
4,Most underated J Geils album,"Without a doubt, this album is the real sleeper of the J Geils legacy. Seth Justman absolutely dominates on this CD, with many of the songs being written around his superb keyboard work. The sound quality on this 1973 release is also top notch. Although the topic of many of the songs is women and love, Peter Wolf injects his traditional raspy vocals that lift many of the songs to great heights. ""Lay your good thing down"", a not-so-subtle reference to doing the wild thing is a perfect example. If you're a true Geils fan, and if like me you had a chance to catch one of their amazing comeback shows during the summer of '99, do yourself a favor and check this album out. It belongs in your collection."
3,Pro forma JGB,"This isn't the best nor the worst J.Geils Band album in their discography, but there aren't any truly extraordinary moments on it. ""Did You No Wrong"" and ""The Lady Makes Demands"" are decent enough, and the rest are Wolf, Justman and Co. doing what they usually did when they were a band. All very competent, but for more than competent from these guys, go to MONKEY ISLAND."
4,Black Sabbath Meets Walt Disney With a Sugar High,"Aquaria is a fairly new band that got help from Angra. They're Brazilian symphonic power speed metal that sounds overly happy yet overly heavy at the same time. The music can be epic at times seen in ""Choice Time"" and ""Judgement Day"" while other times be something from Disney on a sugar high seen in ""Let the Show Begin"" and ""Here Comes the Life"". Cultural sounds can be found throughout the album, especially ""Spirits of Light"" with a crazy drum opening. Overall the album has a very different sound with its symphony and vocals from generic power metal bands and can make you quite happy."
2,Too Slow - Boring - and Show Off,"I am truly disappointed purchasing this DVD. Although the cast is excellent, especially Baltsa as Despina, the conducting is truly disappointed. Too slow, stretching this work way way too long, and have unusual musical pause. If you love the Ostman version, you would be bore to death with this one. This is Mozart a la Hannoncourt, unusual. I am thinking of donating my DVD to the local library....."
2,A very odd Cosi,"I didn't like this version of Cosi Fan Tutte. I love Cecilia Bartoli, but I felt her voice didn't go together well with Nikiteanu's. Maybe it's because they are both mezzo sopranos, I don't know. Also, I didn't think Widmer and Sacca sang their parts well. Agnes Baltsa was excellent as Despina. I think Carlos Chausson did ok for his part, but I had a hard time getting past those devilish eyebrows. It was just weird to me how the Zurich opera house changed the story around. They made Don Alfonso a much darker character and the whole setting (a school) and the weird staging and everything just totally did not work for me. I had a very hard time getting into this production. Thankgoodness I got it from the library first. If you are looking for an excellent Cosi, I suggest the Gardiner version with Amanda Roocroft, Rose Mannion, Rodney Gilfry and Rainer Trost. It is the most beautiful Cosi I know of today."
3,A smidgen of talent peering through the not-so-goodness,"This book includes the statement that plot is overrated. Although I agree with this in many cases, and a book where the detectives pursue a serial killer by sitting around in a diner and telling each other how they really want to get their hands on the guy contains a certain amount of appeal, lack of plot has to be compensated with really good writing, and this book just doesn't have that.It reads as if it were written in an afternoon, and with the frequency that Jason Rogers releases books, I wouldn't be surprised. This is a unique book. Unless you've read other works by Rogers, you've probably never see anything like it before. And it contains some interesting ideas.I would really like to read a good novel by Rogers. And this book is an indication that he is capable of doing it, if only he put in the time and effort. It would be a book unlike any other and it would be a damn good read."
3,hate/love,"Jason Rogers' work = bits streaming from the fundamental processing unit of the brain. These bits sometimes beget meaning; other times they beget aggravation.In short, I hated to love this book even as I loved to hate it. Against my better judgment, I wish to obtain other Jason Rogers titles, especially 'If You Buy This Book, You Are a Moron.'"
2,Lots of errors and too little understanding of musicals,"This author has written several books about films, so I'm guessing he knows about film. Unfortunately, he knows virtually nothing about musicals, and so this book is full of errors of fact, misunderstandings, etc. He routinely gets song titles, plot points, and musical terms wrong throughout the book, and he doesn't seem to have any respect for musicals as an art form. On top of that, this guy thinks Meat Loaf wrote the score for ""Rocky Horror"" (Richard O'Brien did). He thinks ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" is from the stage version of ""Grease"" (it's not). He confuses the lead character's name with the actor who played him in ""Strictly Ballroom"" and gets them both wrong (Mercurio is the ACTOR). That kind of thing is all over this book.There is some useful information here and there, but how can a reader trust that info when there are so many mistakes throughout the book?"
4,iz ok,"This album is kind of the typical sad eyed ""you left me"" country album, with a few exceptions. Both Shotgun Willie and Stay a little Longer offer something new and refreshing...Whiskey River is an awesome song, but like the rest of the album, it lacks originality...it's a good fun album, but don't expect anything groundbreaking"
1,"Save your money, buy cat food instead","As a student of Itto Tenshin Ryu Kenjutsu (a classical Japanese sword fighting technique used by samurai) I must state that this book is a grotesque-horrible bastardization of samurai swordsmanship. Not to mention, you are most certainly going to get yourself hurt if you try to do what is described in this book.Even as a cardio-workout, you are going to tare your body up. Why? the exercises in this book do not match the proper footwork with the appropriate cuts. Also, this type of moment combined with the hyper extension of the body displaces your center of gravity and will unevenly load your joints. An Olympic gymnast may be able to do this workout, but that does not make it right, and especially not right for someone trying to get into shape.If you are a practitioner of the Japaneses sword and want a good laugh; then, by all means buy this book. You will laugh so hard you will commit seppuku."
1,Disappointed,"I found nothing challenging with regard to excercises offered.As a Kendoist this is of little value for conditioning of any kind, perhaps there is a target audience for this book of which I am not aware. As for me it is a disappointment."
4,Swordwork.,The sequenced patterns are excellent to develop fluidity and dexterity with the bokken. Take her suggestion of using music when moving through the patterens it adds a nice touch to the flow. Aikidoka who are familiar with the basic stances and cuts will appreciate the pattern linkages.
3,Go but not complete,"Good book, but it seems to be lacking some depth. Excellent starter book and it is really hard to feel like you have done a work out unless you go for a very long time."
4,A workout,"Doing the cuts and practices as instructed by the book can be quite the workout when you focus on the correctness of your motions, and doing them slowly can make it very rigorous."
1,Beginners Avoid,"I bought this book out of curiosity, I was not expecting much from it, I got even less. Totaly useless for sword practitionners (or anyone else for that matter). Beginners especially should stay away from this book in order not to confuse these instructions with proper technique. If you want a combination of aerobics and proper sword technique try Kendo."
4,Childhood classic,Nicely illustrated childhood classic. It would be great if the book were bigger (to make it easier for young ones to turn the page) but obviously not possible (as all Golden books are the same size).
2,the price says it all,"This book is very poorly made. I suppose I should've expected that given the price, but I haven't owned any other Little Golden Books that were made this cheaply so I figured it was just a great deal. Right out of the box, the gold seal was peeling off the cover. The inside pages are not trimmed to the cover; they stick out past it so they are going to quickly get worn and ruined. The illustrations are okay and it will suffice for this Christmas season so it wasn't a total waste of money, but I think I'll get a better copy for next year and will beware of Little Golden Books in the future."
4,Top notch reference,"As is true of any encyclopedic work, there will be quarrels with what is included and what is not. Nevertheless, this is a highly readable, well organized book. It is accessible to scholars and more casual fans as well. Every college library should have this book. Stylistically and typographically it could be improved, but that would have sent costs even higher. The essays are well-done and the authors of the essays are respected, knowledgeable people. This is just a fine piece of work."
3,very little information about authors,"The book has its moments, but it could have more information abouth the authors. Buy the other books by this author7editor"
4,Gripping Sci-Fi Novel,"Nocturne reminded me of Lord of the Flies in that it's a bit of a social commentary of what might happen if we were stripped of all familiarities and forced to survive as best we could. As with Flies, the result isn't very attractive. Nocturne takes place on a new planet, colonized years ago by Earth. Family structures are no longer, and people's surnames are indicative of the school they attended. Each section of Nocturne has a governmental structure which is ultimately overseen by a higher council. Again, to me, it drew similarities to Lord of the Flies, except there are regions rather than individuals-- though the individuals certainly have their own agendas as well.The critical conflict occurs when there is an explosion that destroys a vital food storage bin. Was the explosion an accident or an act of deliberate cruelty and manipulation? You'll have to see for yourself in this gripping sci-fi novel."
3,"Good for unique characters, but not great quality","The only reason to get this set is to get the two characters not available elsewhere, namely Poggle the Lesser and San Hill. However, they don't hold up particularly well by today's standards. The Dooku figure is particularly bad as its hands can't even grab a lightsaber. I personally only bought this figure to make a custom Darth Plagueis figure out of the San Hill. The figure works well enough for that at least."
4,Pist On - 'Number One' (Atlantic/WEA),"Had forgot all about this CD,until I happen to come across it in an old box of cassettes,CD's,etc.First of just two(2)titles the band had released.Musically speaking,'Number One' is in a more goth/metal direction;partially due to the fact that Josh Silver(Type O Negative's keyboardist)had produced this opus.I believe I even saw these guys out on this very tour.I remember running across plenty of patrons who really dug Pist On as a 'new and upcoming' band with a future.Never did hear much from them after this record.Line-up:Henry Font-guitar&vocals,Paul Poulos-lead guitar,Val Lum-bass&vocals and Danny Jam Kavadlo-drums.Might appeal to fans of Danzig,Cannibal Corpse,X-Cops and Life Of Agony."
5,Success @ last!,"I initially bought the UNILLUSTRATED ED. After calling Cust Svc was able to find and download ILLUSTRATED ED. NOTE plus sign next to Kindle ED, press and search for ILLUSTRATED ED. This edition will download pics! I had iBook Edition with pics, but, needed copy on my small Kindle. Success at last! Svc rep stuck with me to the end! Tnx!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I'm sure this is the best book written by Mingfong Ho yet. Some of her earlier novels like The Clay Marble are a bit creaky but this novel doesn't have a false note in it! The story involves a girl who is caught up in the Khmer Rouge evacuation of Cambodia and is sent to work in a camp in the rural areas. Some members of her family die while others survive. Mingfong Ho worked in the refugee camps in Thailand for Cambodians and speaks Thai as well as Chinese and English. She witnessed the lives of the Khmer people in refugee camps and heard their stories. This all comes alive in the book and makes the story much more realistic than some other novels about the Khmer Rouge time. She has also grown as a writer and communicate her story in a clear, descriptive manner. There is no doubt that she is now a terrific children's novelist."
4,Great for HVAC,"Tensioner works fine. I prefer this type to the self-cutting, you have more control over how tight the strap will be before you cut it."
2,Not a math book for any science students,The book presents most of the important formulas with some cartoon pictures. But there is no mathematical deduction or any related calculations. Not recommended for any science students.
2,I don't see the point to this book,"This book will not teach you any math. It makes no sense unless you already know what it's talking about. (Or maybe if you are brilliantly intuitive about math, but then you've probably seen these formulas already.)Entertainment-value-wise, it starts off amusingly at the beginning, but then quickly devolves into such passages as, ""It is possible to show that the angles C1GC3, C1GC2, and so on are all equal and that their cosine is -1/3. This is because if B designates the point where the line C1G intersects the plane C2C3C4, then the distance GB equals one-third of C1G... the angle must be approximately 109 degrees 28 minutes.""Maybe fun to read as a refresher for math you have learned but long forgotten."
3,it's ok but expecting more,"I love N.T.'s ""Everyone"" series. The Romans books are especially good. However, the Matthew book is a bit shallow. I was expecting much more in regards to the commentaries on the Beatitudes and Sermon on the Mount. It's not bad, just a bit shallow compared to his other book."
3,Good For What It Is,"The strength of this book is in NT Wright's ability to relate what Matthew is saying to our modern world. He does an excellent job of bridging the gap between Jesus' world and ours and thus this would be a great book to help connect ""everyone"" to Matthew. Yet the weakness as mentioned by others is that he is usually only looking at the big idea of a section rather than dealing with it on a verse by verse level. Therefore, his commentary may almost leave more unanswered questions then answers. His commentary on each section is essentially equivalent to a 3-5 minute devotional.I would recommend this book to someone who is brand new to Scripture, someone under the age of 18 or someone who just wants a short, concise understanding of the big ideas of Matthew but for those truly wanting to dig deep into Matthew and wrestle with everything Jesus is saying there would be better options."
4,Great resource,This book series by NT Wright is great! An easy to read and helpful resource for preaching and lay people alike.
2,Not realy a whitening soap so am not surprised it doesn't work,First of all the soap isn't a whitening soap but the label says makari clarifying exfoliating antiseptic soapwith no mentioning of the whitening part.I have been using it for a month with no effect except for my skingetting dry and having a white residue on my skin after my shower.It looks pretty weird on black skin so ihave to make sure i have an extra rinse after wards.Also my face keeps breaking out when i use it.
1,didnt work for me,it did made my face lighter after using it for about 3 days..but then my skin started to breakout..i stopped using it..i have tried alot of whitening soaps and this is one of the worst..
3,Not sure if I like it,"I think this (Makari) whitening soap did lighten my skin. I'm African American; however, it left my skin sooo dry! So as long as you put a moisterizer on afterwards then you should be fine. So having said that I think it works at least on me because my tone is a bit lighter--my makeup no longer really fits anymore, but I would rather want my skin to feel hydrated and not feeling stretched."
3,The shipping cost is too high for this type of product.,"The product is good, but it is expensive.Also the shipping cost is high for this small product.Therefore, I was not happy for the price paid."
3,Not worth the price,"I have been using the soap, body milk AND serum for the past 2 wks.I face has broken out severely. I am not sure which one is the culprit but I would have to stop using them.I used TOPICLEAR for over 10YRS AND it works fine, doesn't cause break outs but DOES have hydroquinone 2%. Just wanted to try a different product but the additional price and hype hasn't paid off for me."
5,Very Good for Sensitive Skin,This is a very good soap for people w/ sensitive skin. I have eczema and extremely sensitive and this soap is non-irritating. I don't know if I've noticed any lightening yet but my skin is a lot softer.
3,Whitening soap,"This soap does make my skin very soft, but did not lighten my skin. I was hoping for a miracle. I have a lot of freckles and was hoping that this soap would lighten them up, but it didn't."
2,works after a while,"I have used this soap for a couple of months. Bought it to reduce my acne scars. I did not see any results at first so I stopped using it. I went back to it after a few weeks. It does lighten but does not remove any scars, the original purpose i purchased this."
4,Georges Bizet - Carmen - ROH Covent garden,This is the 2nd video/DVD of the opera Carmen by Bizet that I have seen - 2 different productions. I like this DVD because it includes English subtitles - perfect for my use as a college music history teacher. Ths music is excellent from the orchestra to the singers.I do have one complaint with the interpretation. The final scene where Don Jose kills Carmen was a little cheesy. Several of my students found the Choreography (where he beats her before killing her) humorous. A bit immature on the student's part but none the less - I also did not think it was a believable interpretation of someone being abused then killed.
4,Skip the Hollywood version....Get this one!!,Excellent version of Carmen. It comes closer to the recicative version than any version that I've seen. This one is a keeper!!
2,Good performance excepted poor audio quality for DVD,"The performance were grate, Flamenco dance not as grand as expected, Opera sang in French not Italian. Audio quality may occured on my dics only, IE should try to add more sofeware available to DVD on their next release ie. AIDA."
1,misleading label,"The product does contain 595 mg potassium gluconate, but this translates into 99 mg of usable potassium (3% RDA).You would have to take 1/3 of the bottle (35 capsules) to get your daily potassium RDA.The key information provided should be the mg of usable potassium so that a reader can assess that amount in terms of the 3500 mg needed per day."
2,Not really for kids,"I got the boat for my son (7 year). It was not 100% waterproof and I had to ""reseal"" it after the first day. Nevertheless the internal electronics started to corrode. Invested a lot of time and effort to keep the boat running. I assume with 100% care and tenderness the boat works like a charm, but thats not how kids play."
2,Great boat but only lasted briefly,My son enjoyed this boat maybe 3-4 times before it must have died from water getting into the controls. Needs better water-proofing!
1,Not a Good Introduction,"Unless you have many, many years of advanced mathematics under your belt don't bother. Also, there are no examples actually pertaining to QM."
4,Good size,Fast delivery and arrived well packaged. Good quality hose and ends. The quick release fittings in the picture are not included. Compact and easy to store. Stretched easily and quickly returns to coiled length. Very happy.
4,interesting...,"this is an interesting book about the facts surrounding the list murders, as well as an insight into his thinking. i remember this incident well, as i was about 18 when it happened, and my best friend lived 5 min. from there. we did the usual silly teen-age night time driveby of the house, scaring the wits out of ourselves. and forty years later, this book brought the chills back."
3,Excellent book but...,This is a good book so far BUT I'm within the first fifty pages and I've already found a handful of grammatical and spelling errors which irritates me immensely.8/6/08 I'm about half way through it and it is quite good. It's an excellent look into how a killer is constructed.
4,A desperate man murders his family,"John Emil List was deeply religious - so he reasoned that if he murdered his mother, wife, and three children (his family was financially strapped, his wife ill and the children rebellious) they would go to heaven rather than hell. After committing the premeditated and cold blooded crime, List disappeared for almost eighteen years, until a neighbor recognized him on ""America's Most Wanted"". A compelling and shocking read. Unbeknownst to List, the painting on the ceiling of the ballroom was a signed Louis Tiffany. He could have sold that off and his financial problems would have been past tense."
4,Hometown,"I actually grew up in Westfield and remember (though just barely) when these murders actually took place. The authors definitely know the area well and use this knowledge to involve the readers in every detail. When I was a boy, we used to dare each other to run up to the house. It's definitely a piece of true-crime history and one that is described very well here."
2,The Sound is BAD,"I have to agree with ""A Viewer From San Francisco""'s review.If you already have a good knowledge of this work, the unusualstaging could be described as ""interesting""; if you don't,well, Pelleas and Melisande is already baffling enough (it'ssupposed to be). But the sound in the later part of thedisc (after the layer switch perhaps, is this an authoringerror?) is absolutely atrocious. Hopefully Image may beable to correct this problem, or another video production willsurface. This beautiful music deserves much better."
2,Nonsense,"I don't mind updated productions of operas provided they make sense. This Pelleas is ridiculous. Why any director would take a symbolist work and try to symbolize symbols...does NOT make sense to me. Debussy spent a long time on this score, and painted every sound and action into the score. But what we have here, is a musical depiction of a fountain while drinking a glass of water. Characters stare into space, or seemingly talk to themselves and walk about like zombies. Pelleas is such a beautiful work. Debussy and Maeterlinck did a great job...why do thay want to spoil things?"
1,Sound is very very bad,It was an interesting experience through the first three acts but then the sound became so bad I threw the DVD into the waste basket.
1,Karen Bouris Authors The Dullest Sex Book I Ever Read!,"What an awful book about a usually interesting subject. I didn't think any book about sex between men and women could be this bad, but Karen Bouris has turned the trick.Avoid this one like the plague!Ecccch!"
2,My Low mylo,"I bought this gadget because I'm a Sonyphile....unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. The Skype feature did not work well...my movies, easily seen on my PSP would not work on this device, album covers would only transfer using Sonic Stage and the topper is that no one at Sony knows how to fix one of these things. I'm returning it today after two weeks of screwing around with it. Gonna get me a Sony w850i Walkman phone and replace my Audiovox 5600 SMT for the same price."
4,Great,Reminder that the mylo is targeted to COLLEGE AGED KIDS which where most campuses has wifi everywhere. Not 30 y/o business execs. They have others toys for you guys leave the mylo alone to college kids.
2,full of bulls... overpriced gimmicky gadget,"4 stars for neat factor, 0 stars for price. in 2006 you now know why sony sucks at portable electronics, they not only missed the boat, they still think their original sony cassette walkman is still the bomb. for half the price you can pick up any smart phone with ten times the features. file this under mini-disc, memory stick, and beta. a strong brand getting weakened by its own products... who's in charge there anyway??? (although for $50 to $99 i can see this item flying out the door.)"
1,Not worth the money,"I was delighted when I first recieved this little toy in the mail; however, I am now severely disappointed.It has poor connectivity; at least, mine does. It takes several tries for me to connect, even when the device detects a strong signal. Then when I do finally connect, half the time the pages I wish to view will not load.It has excellent sound, which to me is its only redeeming quality. I use it now primarily as my MP3 player since I didn't have one until I bought this device . . .but I am seriously considering selling it on Ebay. For a little more, I could have gotten a Sidekick III."
3,Sony mylo,"Pretty cool product for IM and Skype, but take into consideration that you need the Sony proprietary software, Sony Image Converter 2, to make the video function work properly. Currently, this software is not included with the purchase of a mylo."
1,Don't Buy Anything From Sony,I bought my son a Mylo for Christmas. It was a nice device while it worked. 3 weeks later and the screen is acting up. As I write this I am STILL on the phone after 72 minutes waiting to speak to the 5th person. Noone has any power to do anything not to mention know what to do. The level of incompetence exhibited by their personnal is beyond belief. If this is how Sony supports their products this will be the last Sony anything that makes it into this house.
2,"Cool looking, limited functionality","Good things:Skype VOIP phoneSkype Messaging clientMP3 playerPhoto AlbumBad things:Terrible keyboard (too small, top row too close to display, space bar is not centered)No VPN support for emailDisplay size is not optimized for web pagesNo backlit keyboardNo games or flash support for web games"
4,Good Wi-fi Connectivity But a Caveat,"The audio quality using SKYPE is very, very good. Battery life is so far exceptional, particularly with regard to the Mylo as an mp3 player. But what is troublesome so far has been my inability to make video that plays acceptably by the device. I have used PSP Video 9 and InterVideo to Go to produce mp4 video which the player invariably plays, but the end result is a pixellated catastrophe. Playing the same mp4 files with QuickTime causes no such problems. I have downloaded mp4 files made by Sony's proprietary Image Converter 2 Software; these work well in the Mylo."
4,Deceiving list price,"I recently received these earrings. They are very pretty. Perfect for special occassions. Personally I don't believe it is worth the $139 list price, sale price-yes."
3,Works as good as expected,Assembly was easy. The drain plug holes both need to be drilled out so the plugs would fit in properly. It works much better on loose soil and worked fine for seeding new areas of the lawn. Overall for a homeowners roller it's not bad as long as your expectations match what it is that you are buying.
3,Lawn Roller,"First item shipped did not arrive. After I reported it, the second item arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Assembly of item was not difficult. The directions were easily followed. It will take time to evaluate how item holds up to use, but it appears to be well made."
1,Return Shipping Issues with Amazon,"The product was not as advertized. The original advertizing specified a steel roller. It arrived without 2 important pieces and could not be used. I followed the Amazon return process and sent the item back at a high shipping cost. When the seller was contacted they informed me that, contrary to the Amazon return process, I should not have returned the item. The seller refunded the sales price but I have not heard from Amazon. By providing bad return information Amazon has cost me return shipping. I have yet to determine my recourse against Amazon."
2,"Same writers, same uninteresting crap","Ms. Bright seems to have made her fortune with this annual volume and though I haven't read it since 1998 or so, I did get this one as a gift and was profoundly disappointed. I've read much better erotica in other books that didn't claim to be the ""best."" I think, really, this series is pretty overrated."
2,yawner,"Some peole love this collection because it has a taste of something for everybody. But that also means that you are only likely to find a few stories to your personal taste. I was bored through most of the stories. I love susie bright, but her name wont be enough for me to purchase on a whim anymore."
1,By far the most overrated series in the history of erotica,"Once again Susie supposed tastemaker of erotica Bright has thrown together a collection of mundane and not particularly well-written smut that should have stayed on the top shelf where it belongs instead of being printed by a reputable publisher. Like her previous volumes, there is little in this cheesy collection to redeem it. Can anybody spell ""hack""? If this is the best American erotica, I'd hate to see the worst. Hang it up, Susie!"
4,Decent Read,"Good magazine. Only complaint is that they send ""THIS IS YOUR LAST ISSUE"" from about the 3rd month, on ... annoying and confusing."
5,"Nicely detailed, high quality - not a toy.","Purchased as a gift for my husband & the following is his review:The Spirit/Opportunity Mars Exploration Rover by Sun Star is a very nicely detailed and high quality miniature.Although it wasn't mentioned in the product description, a display base of the opened landing module wasincluded. The solar arrays flex, the pancam mast rotates as does the pancam/navcam assembly, instrumentassembly, high gain antenna and wheels. It's a nicely weighted miniature replica and makes a nice display forany space exploration buffs especially at such a reasonable price.A couple of warnings though. This is not a toy intended for play especially by young children. Second, there'sa small black, plastic insert in the bottom part of the foam packaging with screw at the bottom. The screwsecures the rover body to the packaging. It can be removed using a small, hobby sized phillips screw driver.I highly recommend this item."
3,Boing Boing the Bionic Cat,The book is fun and believable. It's a little lengthy for a children's book. I read it to eight 5-9 year olds as part of a ceramic arts class and it kept the interest of only one boy (I think it would have kept the interest of more students if it wasn't sooo long.) I liked it though.
2,A fair attempt that falls short.,"The idea of this book is nice, but I wasn't able to appreciate the execution. My biggest issue is the combination of the text and images.The layouts are messy, some illustrations are not on the same spread as the text they are meant to accompany. There are also pictures re-used in smaller versions...I guess to try and punch up the pages of just text. It would have been better to shorten the story, particularly the review of how the cat works, which we see as the professor creates the bionic cat, and again as he explains things to the boy he made it for.Also, the text and illustrations don't seem to have been created for the same age groups. The illustrations are fine for young kids, but the story is too wordy. Older kids could appreciate the story, but might be turned off by the 'cutsy' illustrations.It feels like a book created by people wanting to fill a niche, and for those wanting to read in that niche it serves it's purpose."
4,A charming little lady,"When Mrs Harris , a London cleaning lady, sets her eyes on a Dior dress for the first time, she knows she just has to have one. No mean feat for someone who earns 3 shillings a day. This story is as charming as she is and tells about the lives she changes on her way to reaching her goal.A thoroughly enjoyable read."
1,VERY Poor Quality & Boring,"I eagerly rented Uncle Goddamn after hearing all the hype. Sadly disappointing stuff. It's mildly amusing for about 10 minutes, but the quality is so poor it's sometimes hard to see or hear what's going on, and you can only watch stupid rednecks set this poor drunken guy's crotch on fire so many times before it becomes really boring. Buy it at your own risk, and be prepared to fast forward through huge chunks of the boring sections. If this is the kind of humor you're into, I'd recommend Jackass or even Tom Green. They're both funnier, the pranks are more diverse, and they're both of good audio & visual quality. ;-) Or better yet, go visit your drunken neighbors in the trailer park down the street and tape THEM. Probably more entertaining."
3,White trash hillbilly fun!,"A look into the home of a white trash hillbilly family taken sometime in the mid 1980's. Most of the video contains clips of practicle jokes a family plays on their slobbenly drunk uncle, ""Uncle Goddamn"". Jokes like lighting his crotch on fire and taping his head up. Some of it is cruel and hilarious, almost to the point that you feel bad laughing at it. Especially funny are the extra clips of the other drunk members of the family like ""Pappy"". If you like Jackass, here is their inspiration!"
3,"Good for Then, Average for Now","[The publication date of] 1994 is a long ways off computerwise. There are still a lot of really good general concepts andWindows specific information, but you can tell some things a bit more 'today-ish' haven't been addressed.There were a lot of things, like how to write error messages, which I always found fairly valuable. But there's nothing about web.It's too bad, because I think it's a well done book..."
1,Recycled garbage,Same stuff he wrote years ago in Up and Down with the RS. Just a loser trying to make money from his association with Keith Richards many years ago.
1,Am I alone here?,Why would anyone pay $6 for a review of a book? The actual book is available used on Amazon for less. Sheesh.
3,Mediocre,"Nothing here you couldn't learn from the tutorial book that is included with the software package. I give it a low rating, not because what it has isn't good, its what it doesn't have. THERE'S NOT A WORD ABOUT THE FOLLOWING:Advanced animation,Animation particals,Partical arrays,Bones,Skinning,And more.If you EVER get advanced at MAX this book's just another dust collecter. If you're just starting out, it can be rather useful, though it's basically a paper copy of your valuable F1 key."
4,"It's a Reference, not a tutorial","The book is a handy and easy to use reference when starting off with 3ds max 4. It is not intended to teach you the concepts underlying 3D modelling, but rather it a step-by-step guide for performing the various functions in 3ds max. (Which has a cryptic interface to say the least!)I use the book as a sort of second manual in addition to Discreet's documentation."
1,save your money,I have learned more in five minutes with the on line tutorials that come with the program than I have learned in 3 hours with this book.
3,to difficult or to easy?,"The book of Swinburne is intended for a general public. He has tried to give a not so hard explanation and defense for the existence of God. Although I agree with most things in the book, it is still not always very good. I think the main problem is, that it is a version of his academic book on the existence of God. Swinburne uses in that book a very broad argumentation to prove that the existence of God is more probable than his non-existence."
2,I did not get very much from this one.,"Maybe I am stupid or ignorant, but this book did not give me very much. Read some C.S. Lewis, Philip Yancey or Donald Miller instead."
2,Not a memorable experience....,"I read this book for an undergraduate course on the idea of God paired with Richard Mackie's 'the Miracle of Theism'. In hindsight, that is a better book-- but it is also arguing an easier point... that God and miracles, etc. doesn't exist is an easier debating point than the one left for Swinburne.Is this a coherent book? Yes. Definately. He argues his point much as a Cambridge man should. Is the point taken, well....Perhaps this is a better book to buy than my two stars indicates. Buy it and the Mackie. Compare. Then fall into the faith-based existentialist arguments of Kierkagard if you still want logic to prove a God...."
5,Easy to instal and use!,"I orded this for our Ford F-150. We have a Fifth-wheel camper, and when it was attached to the truck, the weight caused it to 'dip down' where the hitch is. With the air-bags, all we have to do is hook up the camper, program the remote, and the lift fills with air to even the ride out!"
2,"Beautifully written, Ultimately Boring","This book was beautifully written; I found myself pausing to admire the language frequently, with images clinging quietly but powerfully. I also enjoyed the dialect that Naomi uses to express herself -- at least at first.That said, very little happened. I'm more in favor of character-driven versus plot-driven novels, but the character here wasn't strong enough to drive things and there was way too much repetition. Both the infidelity theme and the forgiveness theme were driven into the ground. A much better novella than novel.I also wonder if a woman who spent 60 years away from the South would still be so very, very Southern in her voice. I've lived away from my home for only 25 years and have lost much of my local accent. ""Might could"" and ""fixing to,"" ""couple three"" seem as if they might have dropped by the wayside after that long a time. Also, they became irritating after a while rather than charming -- a big reason most authors avoid dialect."
2,BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK!,"Make sure you have a sunny outlook on life and a cheery disposition because when you read this book, it will bring you down! It is very depressing. Yes, it is well written; however, you keep waiting for some cheery bit to come along and make it all better and it doesn't. I had to skim through the end just because I'd had enough. I seriously thought about putting it down for good many times; not sure why I wanted to finish it....curiosity that it HAD to get better and happier? Not one of my favorites."
2,Disappointed,Found Brett Lott's personal religious beliefs intrusive in the book. I did not finish it. First book I have purchased that has been disappointing. Would not recommend it.
1,Couldn't get through it,"I picked up this book at the library because I thought I would try something new. After reading the first part carefully, I found myself skipping sections trying to get through it to see if anything would ever happen. I normally finish every book that gets my attention in the first chapter but this one, I was asking myself if I wanted to finish it. I didn't want to waste my time if wasn't going to get better. Even though it doesn't go into detail, there is just way too much sex in it, as if that is the only joy in life other than having your own child. The way the author handles themes of infertility and the loss of a child or spouse is depressing. After reading the other reviews, I have decided not to finish the book."
3,Nice Story....somewhat sappy,I liked this book. Parts made me teary. It was written in a way where you could feel the emotion Lott was expressing thru his words. The story line was interesting enough. And the feelings the characters were experiencing were very vivid.The only thing I didn't like was it was wordy and a bit sappy.
3,Could be much more,"I found myself disappointed in this book after reading a great review of it elsewhere. Mr. Lott writes beautifully but goes way overboard in some of his descriptive passages and constant rehashing of Naomi's ""sin"". Get over it already! Instead of finding Naomi a sympathetic character, which I believe was his intention, I became exasperated with her whining, self flagellation and deep, emotional thoughts. There's a lot of promise here but I was glad when it was over."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"After reading Jewel (a difficult one to start, but got much better by mid-way), I thought I would give ""A Song I Knew by Heart a try. Again, a very slow start but it remained that way until the end. A lot of repitition and a lot of nothing!! Big disappointment!"
1,"Great design, cheap materials","We ordered the ""pro"" model thinking that this would be of higher quality than the standard model. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The hopper (where the dry food goes) is made out of a cheap plastic and is not durable. The first one we received from Amazon came with two cracks in the hopper. The replacement unit sent to us also had a crack in the hopper towards the base. I really wish this product was more durable because it would have looked great on our countertop."
3,Disappointing book,"I was really disappointed in this book because I have enjoyed her other books so much and I have been a gardener since birth. You would be better off buying Patricia Telesco's ""Gardening with the Goddess"". Ms. Monaghan instead of using her imagination for the plants in the various gardens uses the named cultivars and not the attributes of the plants. Such as buying the ""Fairy tm"" rose and not using plants that attract faery energies such as columbine. abutilon, primrose etc. Using trademarked plants is a big cop out."
3,Not at the same level as usual from MS Press,"Fair book, however falls short of the usual high standards by Microsoft Press. This book has been written by an outside company on behalf of MS Press. Too many words and repetitive writing and a large amount of errors is the downfall of this book. Check out http://mspress.microsoft.com/support and run a search based on the book title. This will reveal some of the shortcomings of this edition."
4,"Good for reference, but not for exam preperation","This book covers a lot of information on network monitoring, troubleshooting and network optimization. It also covers a good design approach such as Domain structure and trust relationship. I found this book is the best reference for anybody who want to master NT server optimization and design. But, It is not a very good for exam preperation. I read the book cover to cover, I pass the exam. But I recommend use other material for exam."
3,Use with prior NT experience and ISBN 0-7356-0539-4,"This kit from MS is pretty loaded with theory and core info - trying to read it quickly in a cram situation could be detremental to ones health.The test was a pretty nasty 90 minutes, it has been changed back to 50 or 55 questions - it is no longer adaptive.I was amazed at the sheer number of seemingly trick questions I ran into on the actual exam.Again, like most of the exams, I used Transcenders in conjunction with book material - The multimedia CD-ROM is pretty thin on content with this kit, but it did lock in ""local"" and ""global"" group theory successfully.For additional sample questions to cross reference with this kit try ISBN 0-7356-0539-4, MCSE Readiness Review Exam 70-068 Windows NT 4.0 Server Enterprise by Microsoft Press.This was the hardest of the tests so far - the others taking me about 25 minutes to complete - this one took about 90 minutes."
3,It's OK.,"I wasn't overly impressed with this dream book. Maybe it's the way I'm looking things up, but I have a hard time finding what my dreams are about in here! But when I do find a similiar wording it's fun to read."
2,Eugene's Opinion,"While it is an ""Encylopeida"" it is more than is required to interpret a dream, which is what I wanted -- merely to get an idea of what my dream might mean.Also, all the ""Lucky Numbers"" are just silly.Had I purchased locally instead of on line I would have returned it.ES"
5,"Great Fast Service, Exactley what I thought I was ordering.",Will definatley buy from again! Fast service! Nice note inclose in the book! Cannot wait to give this as a gift!!
1,WORST DREAM BOOK EVER-- GARBAGE!!!,"Zolar's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams: Fully Revised and Updated for the 21st CenturyThis is the most poorly written and amateurish dream book I have ever read!!!, the dream meanings are so predictable and filled with nonsense, that anyone with any knowledge of the subject would think that it was written by a child,it's easy to see why in the introduction, the author states ""...have as much fun with this book as I have had in presenting it to you"",the author has taken a book that most people would look to for some serious insight to what their dreams really meant, and turned it into a book of complete nonsense!!!"
2,"Entertaining, But Inconsistent","An incomplete list of different variables that can be found in your dreams and what they stand for. I would often reference this to not find a description of a common item appearing in my dreams. This guide is best used if you immediately record your dream on paper, then search the Encyclopedia later on."
4,Well done - except for some bias,"Chief Justice Rehnquist authors a very interesting and informative history of the Supreme Court. However, in the later chapters Justice Rehnquist lets some of his personal slants on issues (and other Justices) tailor some of his views in some unfortunate ways. Overall, however, a very good book."
5,This book is great!,Palac's ability to reveal the personal and sometimes painful elements of her psycho-sexual journey are rivaled only by her wonderful sense of humor. _The Edge of the Bed_ is a page turner that made me and several of my friends laugh and cry--a rare feat of personal honesty.
2,Disappointing,"Although with the word ""Kinetic"" in the title, you would expect that this mobile moves, and indeed, this is supposed to rotate in some way according to the instructions. However, ours does not continue to rotate ""perpetually"" when it is ""started"" as described by the directions. I changed batteries and adjusted the mobile bit up and down with no success. Disappointing!"
4,Fun to observe!,"I bought this as kind of a reminder of how important it is to keep my life in balance. I was under the impression that it would turn in the same direction perpetually and not turn around one way and then start to turn back the other way and then start that cycle all over again, (I guess because of the thread it hangs from), but that said it is still a cool piece to own and it does do the trick reminding me just how important ""balance"" is in this life even if it is just sitting there still without moving at all. Only one other thing, I don't think once you put the batteries in there is a way to turn it off unless you take the batteries back out again which is kind of a hassle. Cheers!"
1,Not what I expected,"I thought for the price this is, it would be good, but when I tried it, it did not work, I changed the batteries and it still did not work. Quite dissapointing."
4,"Fun to watch, makes a bit of noise","The Kinetic solar system is easy to put together and fun to watch. It doesn't really teach you anything, and one of the rings is slightly misaligned relative to the others. Everyone at work loves it though and it's fun to stare at for awhile. It makes a little bit of noise while it spins but I think I can put a little oil on the shaft to fix that."
4,A GREAT desk toy,"I love this product -- it is mesmerizing and restful on your desk, but easy to set up. Battery will run a long time. Enjoy."
4,LEGENDARY,"Honesty one of the best games I've ever played..The only thing this game lacks is the graphic quality, which is totally uderstandable, considering the age of the game..The learning curve is a bit steep for anyone who hasn't played an MOO game before. BUT, it's defeinitly not as steep as some other games of similar gameplay lay-outs.And the replay value of this game is nearly unmatched..Not joke, this game gets a 9/10 easily.."
5,Classic,"A classic game. While it is an older game it still has great gaming appeal and plenty of replay value. Most wouldn't believe it but many of the games in the genre are based on MOO2.Just a tip, be sure to go into the game settings by right clicking on the icon in the start menu. Set the compatibility to an earlier Windows or 256 graphics and lower resolution in order for the game to run properly."
5,Do you realize how many games have tried to copy MOO 2?,"I'm guessing that MOO 2 is 10 years or older now and in my opinion still has not been surpassed or even equaled and that is despite how many others have copied or attempted to improve on MOO 2. Even MOO 3 failed miserably in its attempt to improve on MOO 2. I remember when I first heard that MOO 3 was coming out and thought to myself ""Why? To be better than MOO 2 it would have to be the greatest game ever created by man"". There have been literally dozens of games that have tried to do better and still have not. MOO 2 is so good that even the dated graphics become a non-issue in short time for new players. Great games never die!"
5,Immersive and Engulfing Strategy Game,"Excellent strategy game with wonderful user interface and a learning curve of about 1/2 hour. Excellent online Info answers most questions that are not answered by the right-click popups for nearly all game controls and items. The jewel case edition includes the 176 page manual on disk as a .pdf file, though the manual will be consulted by most players only out of curiosity or for anecdotal information. Other reviewers have spoken all the words of praise I could lavish on this game. I find it not only ""immersive"" but engulfing! Twice I have stayed awake until 3:00 am playing, simply unable to resist ""one more turn."" I also have this games lineal successor and I find MOO2 to be a much better game in every respect."
3,"Great Solo, Multi Needs Work","The Master of Orion games are very entertaining if you enjoy the build resources and expansion, conquer themes. The different races make is interesting, and it can be done multiplayer.Down sides. Refitting your ships constantly can take a bit, especially when you have to go back and refit or get rid of yoru old ones. And in the solo game, you can tell it to keep passing turns until something actually happens, making the downtime a lot less. Not so for Muliplayer. you could each be sitting there passing your turn back and forth for awhile before you actually want to do another turn"
2,A Trade like Any Other: Female Singers and Dancers in Egypt,"This was disappointing for me. I have a bellydance troupe, and have been to Egypt ,and this book read like someones' essay for school.There is a lot of information indeed, but way too much of the authors opinion of things to wade through.I did find a lot of misinformation too.A lot of ""traditions"" had never been heard of by my friends,young and old, living in different areas all over Egypt. Some were obscure indeed."
3,"Great info, not my idea of a leisure read","I don't think I would leisure read this book. It has a lot of great information in it, but it's written like a college thesis. Some of the research is pretty weak and has a small sampling of people. That said, there are few books on the market that cover the topics that ""A Trade Like Any Other"" does. Any one that is truely looking for information on the lives and work conditions of singers and dancers throughout the last couple hundred years in Egypt should read this book."
5,A Classic !,"Recently I saw a local high school put on this production and loved it! Sortly after I went and purchased this C.D.! It is very, very good. It's very up-beat. My favorite song is the ""Rejoice"" one. I recommend this C.D. to everyone."
4,The Wiz on Broadway is Soul-ful,"Recently I've had the opportunity to direct The Wiz on stage, see the film version, and listen to this CD. The CD omits some of the music, but is honest to the Broadway production. While the film is a travesty, the CD and the musical have an integrity that honors the African American tradition and condition. The CD is rich in its sound and replete in keeping the spirit of Charlie Small's original Broadway production."
4,Lesser known but still great,"This is a great soundtrack in its own right. While the soundtract to the movie is better known, Stephanie Mills does a great job in the role of Dorothy and pulls it off rather nicely. Great companion for the movie soundtrack."
2,Follow the yellow brick road,"Don't ease on down the road.This is a poor substitute for the great Wizard of Oz. It's funny how this supposed update now seems so out of date, while the much older Wizard with Judy never gets any older."
2,"Good for travellers, not so good for serious learners.",This software can get you started in Marathi language. But it is not if you want to study this language. I bought hoping to teach my son Marathi language. This software was not good enough because it only taught conversational Marathi.
4,C2 is perhaps the game with the most fun but also the most basics.,"Civ 2 is a great game despite the graphics (yes, all you people who want a great game, pick this up). The game proves to be hard on so many occasions that it literally becomes fun.Anyway, I recommend this."
5,The best strategy game!,"I absolutely adore and LOVE this game! Civilization 2 is brilliant! My father doesn't understand how to play this, and he's many years older then me (I'm 15).Actually, a lot of people will agree with him. It took me awhile to get the hang of it, but when I did it was very easy. I love everything about this game - the music, the game itself, the videos, EVERYTHING.I love the High Council videos (especially when you're in arnachy and they're not talking to you), the Wonder videos (Very cool), the Throne room, the meetings with your opponents etc.The only complaint I have is that if you're playing with more then one opponent, the units take forever to move and you end up sitting there waiting.Overall, a well made game with lots of things to do and it will keep you hooked for hours (like I was!)"
1,Failure To The Extreme,"It would be nice to get a simulation game that ACTUALLY installs properly on start up. This Civ2 game is a total dud in it's ability to function on standard operating systems. My brother has a Gateway with window95: results, winload G Error 2I have a Packard Bell with windows98: results, winload G Error 2My dad has a Emachines with windows ME: results winload G Error 2It's strange for a CD bought at Amazon.com to have the same error message that gives the cd the same inability to run on 3 totally different computers and operating systems... ironic? I don't think so... Personal Installation mistake? Are you Kidding? since there is virtually no way to make a mistake pressing installation buttons on any of the cd-roms sold today. Upon inspection of the CD, it's spotless... but the compatibility leaves something to be desired."
5,An oldie better than a newbie,"Civ 2 is in most aspects better than Civ 3.First of all it's faster, second it's easier to learn (thus you get fun faster) and third it's more similar to the original.It lacks the culture aspect that Civ3 has, but you can still win by building temples, libraries and Wonders which will boost at max your citizens productivity and allow you to make diplomats who could subvert enemies cities without falling into Civil War.True that graphics are not that awesome, but they do their function very well.Plus it's really affordable for most pockets, especially if you haven't tried any strategy game before and are not sure about spending [money] in one.If you haven't played either Civ2 nor 3 I'd rather recommend you start with Civ2 and afterwards move on to 3..."
5,Excellent Game,Civilzations 2 was an outstanding game. It was by far the greatest strategic pc game i have ever expierienced. PERIOD!
3,A brilliant game in it's time but get Civ III instead,"In it's time, Civilization 2 was the game that kept me at my PC for longer than any other. It's combination of strategy as you attempt to out think your opponents and tactics as you wage war or the enemy and your land is so well balanced, you can lose hours and hours.Right now, though, we have Civilization 3 and that raised the bar much higher. Still, there are some reasons to look at the older version. If you have a low-end machine it's worth it - and there are still some very active user groups creating very playable scenarios.In it's time this was a five star game - but now it's more of a historical masterpiece."
2,Graphics [stink] and a Confusing Game,"This game really does [stink].... I've tried on easy and used the cheat menu and still lost. It's confusing what to do and the graphics make it more confusing. If you want to get this game you better be a rocket scientest to figure out it's graphics and the way of trade. You have to get in war to get land and hope the people will be happy with you by the time your finished, controls [stink], don't use your mouse use your up down left right on the keyboard to move your people, the mouse just skrews up everything. And even if you try everything you can either you lose or you have to use cheats and still your called ""Worthless"" at the end, a bad game to play. With it's simple plan they could get the graphics at least good as the sims, and they could have made the skills easier to understand, it's all confusing to me.Graphics:3/10Fun:3/10Gameplay:6/10Sound:2/10Overall:3/10..."
1,You Get What You Paid For,"Encouraged by the rave reviews, I bought this game but ended up tossing it into the garbage after 6 hours of play. Aside from the horrible 1996 graphics, there is dead boring game play on a buggy interface.You spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure. Dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn, while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map. Historical value is 0, as ancient Egyptians build cities named Melbourne and Helsinki and the American Empire begins with Abe Lincoln in 600 B.C.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Age of Kings or even better, Combat Mission--if you like WWII themes--and you won't be disappointed. They do cost more, but you get what you paid for."
1,This game is so boring!,"This game is extremely boring and very ugly! The graphics look like they came from the 80s and civ games are still coming out with the same old graphics. Ridiculous! This game is a waste of money and time. You may like it if you love ugly, terrible graphics, but for rts fans skip the whole series!"
5,Helped me get a job and succeed in it.,"I'll keep this one short.This book helped me do the following:1. Get confidence as a sales newbie.2. Choose the industry and the product.3. Drive my sales commission check from about $250/week to over $1,200/week in a few months.Buy it. Use it.Phil Saparov"
5,A reference for both novices and experts,"This is perhaps one of the most accessible references on what can be a mind-numbing topic. The authors do a great job describing both structural equation modeling and LISREL in a common-sense manner. Although you'll want to keep your other references (say Bollen 1989), this book makes a great ready reference and perhaps the first that you reach for. The book does a great job of detailing the higher level concepts with voluminous footnotes that can be referenced seperately. Besides being helpful at the conceptual level, the book also deals with the fickle nuances of the LISREL program, a rare combination."
4,Very Good,"Paul Mooney is One of the Most Honest Cats on the Planet. he pulls no punches. He makes you think&reflect. His Humor will make your sides hurt,but he also puts things into perspective. he isn't afraid to talk about Race which is the single most important topic I always feel in America. he always Keeps it real&this stand-up performance pulls no punches. always Entertaining&Mentally challenging. I applaud his Greatness."
3,not too bad of a game,"Not nearly as much fun as the cartoon (which is difficult to compare since the cartoon is awesome beyond all measure where TV is concerned), but it is a fun way to spend an hour or two. If you like the TV show it might be fun, but don't expect DOOM or Starfox -like gameplay. This is one hell of a hard game though."
1,The stinkyest game in the world,"This game is the worse believe me I played it so please don't get it, get the one called beast Wars transformers for playstation,thank you."
5,another generation loves Hannah!,I bought the first season after my 6 year old saw the last Hannah Montana movie. She fell in love with them but hard for her to understand that Hannah was grown up and no longer making movies. I bought the first season to show her that Hannah used to be young and now she is hooked with it all over again. So now it is on to the other seasons.
5,hannah montana season 1,"miley cyrus rocks!10-stars! hope they make more seasons,because they didn't finish the lizzy mcguire seasons and you know how popular that show was also! disney has a way of vaulting things!hope the seasons keep coming."
5,A Must Have!!!!!!,"This is awesome for Hannah fans. It has all the episodes from the first season, which they hardly ever play on tv anymore. My girls who are 8 and 10 love it and watch it over and over again."
1,Pathetic Singer Should Have Stayed Behind The Drums!,Phil should have Never gotten out from behind his drum kit!This CD is a horrible collection of maudlin sappy pop babble.Phil's only talent is as a competent drummer. As a front manhe is a complete Boring Joke! His attempt to carry on Genesiswithout Peter Gabriel was PATHETICALLY LAUGHABLE!
4,Excellent album - a real classic,"I love this album, it's great as each track is so different. There is something for everyone in hear. The last track of the album is superb, on a par with 'In the Air Tonight'."
5,For anyone going through a divorce!,"Trust me, if you're going through a divorce, this record will give you the comfort and solace you need. Accept no imitations. From the shock of finding out about an adulterous afair ""In the Air tonight"" to the resolution"" This Must be Love"" this record will be a new friend. Wonderful band, wonderful cause - an instant classic."
4,HIS BEST ALBUM,"This is The Only Phil Collins I Like For The Most Part all The way.IN The Air Tonight Showcases His Gift at Programming Drum Beats.He has Always Had some tight Beats.I was Hyped When He had The EARTH,WIND&FIRE HORNS.I Missed Again was The Jam.This is His Best Album.His Voice&Playing Sound Solid here."
3,Commercial,"Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist, and I stress the word ARTIST."
4,There's Some Value Here,"This was, for most, one of his best albums produced. It had one hit on it and a few catchy love songs that made it to the Love Songs album of his but it wasn't a great one for me. There were only two new songs there that I had never heard before (I liked them okay) and there were some that were strictly instrumental. An okay album over all, you should not worry about getting it immediately.I'll give it four stars for having In The Air Tonight and a few more songs I liked okay."
2,"BEWARE - not for those of us who liked ""No Jacket Requered""","""Face Value"" isn't bad, I guess, but it most certainly isn't my taste. I absolutely love ""No Jacket..."" and a lot of Phil's later hits, but when I heard this, I was really disappointed. I wont say it's bad, I just want to warn everyone who likes Phil's later (more mainstream pop) songs, that they should listen to this before they buy it."
3,Summer is here !,"Whenever I listen to Phil Collins music, i think it's summertime. He makes you feel it in the air !! Sun...See...Swimming.. if you know what I mean..."
5,Phil Collins' Best Solo CD Ever,"FACE VALUE, the debut solo CD by Phil Collins, is also his best as a solo artist. The recording sessions for this album coincided with discord in his first marriage, and the song ""In The Air Tonight"", with its line ""If you told me you were drowning/I would not lend a hand"" fits perfectly with that situation. This CD is a must-own for any Genesis."
2,A Joke,"I used this book as a textbook for a graduate level class. The content on this book is a disappointment. When I asked my fellow classmate how he felt about the book, he said that it was a joke and I agree. Most of the content on this book are facile compilation of topics. I pity the grad student that has to use this book to make or break him or her. You can get much more knowledge about the subject of management information systems by subscribing to a magazine. There is a lapse in style when it comes to the layout of the book. The backround of the page where the case studies is written is distracting to the eye. The pictures of the book are really old. This book is certainly not for anyone that is teaching him or herself management information system. There is very little use for that purpose. If you have to use this book then dig into some bad writing."
3,Sounds great..,"Great sounds. Difficulty for older people to set various modes.We have 2 of these. Both clocks backlights burned out within six months making it useless at night. CD works well, nature sounds very good. Sound is excellent. When backlight worked display was great. Why should backlight burn out so fast?"
1,Impossible to remember complex programming,Ive had the alarm clock for a few years and they designed it so that it's hard to remember how to program it so it's useless. Don't buy it! Cheap but if it's impossible to program not worth anything.
1,timex clock radio,"I bought this for the added feature of the nature sounds. Liked the dual alarm option as well. However, it is completely non-user friendly. It is so lacking in common sense operation that this appliance has reduced in effectiveness to simply; one person alarm-clock. The less I have to do with the thing the better."
2,A brilliant but short life,"Attracted by its pleasant design and its black-on-yellow display, I bought it and found the radio sound was respectable, but FM sensitivity mediocre. No matter, because within two weeks the radio died a noisy death as the case overheated. A good design concept, that didn't make it due to poor quality."
4,"It didn't work for me, but my babies love it!","I bought this as an alarm clock for my husband and myself, but the large, orange screen/light was too bright and kept me awake.Because the radio has nature sounds, I thought I would try it out on my 13 month-old twins to soothe them to sleep. It worked! Not only that, the bright orange light now comes in handy as a night-light."
2,Why can't anyone make an alarm clock right?,"One hour snooze limit and 1-way alarm/time setting kill this model. Forget about the nature sounds. They're cheap and repetitive sounding, but that's not what I bought the clock for.A week's pay for an intelligently designed clock!! CAN'T FIND ONE. AMAZING!!"
3,Looks cool; is not in fact cool,"We bought this because we loved the cool, space-saving shape, but I'm not fond of it.You might note from the photo that it has TWENTY buttons. Plus a volume knob. I don't care what wonderful things it can do -- a clock radio should not have twenty buttons. It's next to impossible to remember what each one does. And since nearly all of the buttons are on the front face instead of the top, you usually have to pick the thing up to set anything. And the labels for each button are quite small and difficult to read. As a result of all this, my wife doesn't want to learn how to use it, so she relies on me to set the alarm."
3,Pocket Rocket w/Problems,"There are cool features such as triple alarm, 18 radio station presets, adjustable dimmer, calendar display, etc. I thought the sound quality was good.Now, the problems. All the cool stuff required different buttons. The buttons were non-responsive at times which was most of the time. The functions were not that intuitive, it takes time to adjust to the quirks. The volume was not a steady increase but jumped in decibels. Unfortunately, you cannot set your wake for one setting; i.e., set 3 buzzers but have to set your wake for three different settings such as radio, sounds, and buzzer.This clock/radio has some nice features; unfortunately, there were quirks."
2,Digital Tuner Died on Me Too,"At first the Digital Tuner worked great and really pulled in the stations that were fuzzy on my old analogue tuned radio. However, after owning the Timex T300b for about a month the tuner just died and would no longer tune to any other station than the one it was stuck on. This phenomenon occurred on both the AM and FM bands.Also the ""waking to nature sounds"" tape loops are way too short. They only last 5 seconds before repeating! Try waking up to the ""Brook"" tape loop. Every 5 seconds you have this really annoying bird chirping the exact same chirps over and over again! And the ocean has the same splash sounds every 5 seconds. It is insanely repetitive!"
1,Nice Features but No Reliability,Have had two of these clocks now. The first one lasted a little over a month and the second one a little over 6 months. Love the features but the product design has problems.
1,disappointed - very disappointed,"The design is great, the sounds are very good, the idea is fun; but...the orange backlighting and the very thin lines of the numbers make visibility from across the room in the middle of the night/early morning negligible. The controls require holding the clock at an awkward angle for setting, the setting process is extremely detailed (and no, I am not an inept female), and my particular model would lose lines on the face if the clock were tipped to facilitate setting. In general, a negative experience, a very unexpected negative experience."
1,"Don't buy it, buy any other alarm clock","Trying to set this is past setting your vcr.Trying to turn it off when you just woke up is a nightmare.Buy any other alarm clock, this is a computer geeks worst nightmare."
3,"Not bad, Not great, Look some more","The clock display is slightly bright at its lowest setting. The sound from the clock is pretty poor, and the volume control is not very accurate. It goes from too soft to loud to distorted loud. I have a hard time finding just the right volume.The nature sounds are a nice alternative to the standard buzzer, but the quality is bad.The buttons on my clock are hard to push and often one push of the button makes the hour/min jump by two or three. The paint on the buttons has worn away (after about 4 years) and the radio reception seems to be on the low side.That all being said, it has worked steadily for about 4 years with no serious problems. While not a terrible clock, you could find better."
1,Save your money,"I had a Sony clock radio and was interested in getting a digital radio because the tuner always got bumped. This was supposed to improve the situation. Instead, I got a radio that will not pick up local stations with sound quality so poor that much of the conversation is not understandable."
1,time loss,"This is a pretty bad clock. Exampe: on avaerage, it loses a minute every week. After a while you get sick of adjusting the time, so after a month, I have to mentally add 4-5 minutes to whatever time it shows."
1,Stay Away from this Clock Radio,"I purchased this product solely for the digital radio tuner capability, and it was a complete disappointment. The FM reception worked the first time out of the box, then subsequent efforts to tune in a station became increasingly difficult. When it started to tune in 103.5 when I selected 92.3, I returned it. In addition, the buttons are hard to find and it is a confusing product to operate. Unless you are really interested in waking to nature sounds, stay away."
3,"Great look, average clock !","1- Too hard to push the buttons 2- Bad Reception of Radio 3- Hard to set the alarm .For ex; if the alarm is set to 9 am, and if you wanna set it to 8 am , you have to go all the way 10,11,12am.....1,2,3pm.....12,1,2....and finally 8ambasically doesn't worth buying"
3,"Great Clock, if you don't want to tell time and like noise.","""Nature sounds!"" it says. I thought to myself, hey self, that would be a nice relaxing way to wake up...Wrong. The ""nature sounds,"" advertised as Ocean, Brook, and Forest, are more accurately described as ""Garbled Static,"" ""Unidentifiable Cacophony,"" and ""Kittens in a Blender.""The display itself is awful. It's fine in daylight, but I have to turn it away from me at night, or the Massive Orange Beacon of Halogen Death keeps me awake. In other words, it's too dadgum bright. So bright that when you wake up in the middle of the night and look at the clock, you're completely unable to read the time until your pupils have adjusted to their ""high noon in the Sahara"" setting.Recommendation: The features I bought it for aren't worth it, but it was a decent price, and the radio is ok, so I'll deal with it until it breaks or gets lost in a move."
1,Caveat emptor,"I've owned this clock for several months and I still haven't been able to get the thing figured out...lots of push button 1, then push button 2 6 times, blah, blah. Suffice it to say, set-up ain't easy.Next, the reception is almost non-existent. The antenna is nothing more than a flimsy black wire you pull out of the back! AM/FM, it doesn't matter. All I hear is a bunch of static and I'm less than 50 miles from NYC.Finally, the nature sounds? More annoying then soothing. They sound anything but natural.Needless to say, less than 2 months later, I'm back on Amazon looking to replace this clock. 'Nuff said."
4,GREAT FEATIRES,"Very nice sound quality, easy to set and reset. Like the sounds, but don't wake me up, do help me to relax. I would recommend this with no reservations. Very sleek and modern looking and doesn't take up much room."
3,The backlit clock is irritating!!,"The adjustable backlighting would seem to be a nice feature, but even at the dimmest readable light, it seems to light up a dark room much more than an LED that the old fashion clock radios have. If light in your room while you are sleeping bothers you, don't get the Timex or any other backlit clock.Also, the curved plastic cover on the front of the clock is problematic because there can easily be glare problems when trying to read the time from a side angle if sunlight is shining in the window.This type of backlight make the time generally less readable from across the room compared to an LED style clock.I'm sending mine back."
2,Pretentious but thought provoking opus,"As a 'paper architect' Rhowbotham has the freedom to desert the real world, and certainly revels in doing just that in this provocative but ultimately dissatisfying book. Using images produced by his students, the author champions a way of thinking which probably has some merit. However, his use of language is so complex as to defeat comprehension much of the time. Rhowbotham sees himself as a leader of the avant garde, but this book does little to advance his claim and is a missed opportunity for us to learn about an obviously talented individual."
3,Atari Arcade Hits 1,"Progam may work well using keyboard, but I prefer to use the joystick, and game plays very choppy."
5,Great Games.,"This has 6 classic games: Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, Tempest, Super Breakout, and Pong. I especially enjoyed pong. This is a great value, since versions of each of the games are sold by themselves for $20."
3,This was good for what it was,"It wasn't all that great. The best point of the whole thing was listening to the jazz like arrangements and interpreting what was possibly meant by this or that different voicing/ chord substition. A lot of songs take on a whole different meaning when they are reinterpreted (which explains why some people have bigger hits when playing other people's music), but these songs didn't take on all that different of a meaning from the original pieces.The strongest track was ""The Fool on The Hill.""This is worth a secondhand purchase price and not much more."
1,blown not blowin,"Tragically wasted opportunity, to match the magnificence of Sarah Vaughan's voice, with the wealth of material available, in the Beatles catalogue. Song selection could have been better, the arrangements could NOT have been worse. Paitch misfires on all cylinders. Most of the arrangements sound like really bad attempts, to sound like Earth, Wind and Fire. This could have been really special. Too bad it turned into this mess. Has to be Sarah's worst."
2,somewhat disappointing,"This clock does NOT wake you to nature sounds, but you can go to sleep listening to nature sounds (that aren't that soothing). It wakes you to your choice of two bell sounds (chimes) that are supposed to gradually get louder (gentle wake), but it gets pretty loud rather quickly! The clock face is big and bright, but the way it's tilted upward, I had to sit up in bed to read the time display! The alarm does not automatically reset - each night you have to remember to set the alarm. I went looking for a new one after a week."
4,Sequel to Willard - more a friendship story than horror,"Michael Jackson song the theme song into our hearts and history, while Lee Montgomery reminded us of what it was like to not have friends.A sequel to the highly successful horror movie, WILLARD. The story begins with Willard and Ben arguing at home & moves to the touching friendship between a lonely, ill boy and an intelligent rat.The rats may scare the young children, but if they can handle them and the very G rated killings, I do recommend this movie for children over 8."
1,Boring movie.,"A real corndog. Boring rat sqeeks and kid understands everything he says. This is a very poor sequel to ""Willard"" which was a very good flick by comparison."
1,Defective cell phone battery,Battery described as new has about 12 hours of standby life when fully charged. this is less than the capacity of the 1-2 year old battery I am replacing. Item is not as described or expected. I will not buy here again.
1,weak battery,New battery will not stay charged. It will not charge as well as the one year old battery that came with phone.
5,One of the greatest voices for Judaism we have today,"This work opens with a moving personal introduction by Rabbi Riskin in which he pays tribute to the beloved grandmother who inspired his Torah Study. It continues with a series of illuminating commentaries on the Parshat HaShevuah. Many of these commentaries appeared first as Rabbi Riskin's Friday column in the Jerusalem Post.Rabbi Riskin teaches love of the Torah, love of the people and land of Israel- service of God. He makes the Torah live for us in our day.This is an invaluable collection by one of the most important teachers of Judaism we have today."
3,Joseba Deuna,"Interesting but shallow. It presents seven African animals in a normal length film, therefore it dedicates not much time to each of them. Video quality is good. I have seen better films on African animals."
5,Buckner fans can't miss out of not having this CD,"Search everywhere until you find this CD, if it's to the nearest stack of CD's in your bedroom or to the nearest indieCD store or to wherever maybe even Amazon will get some soon. Whatever it takes you should have it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is poorly written, uninformative, and poorly laid out. It is a compilation of books and magazine articles you've already read and pictures you've already seen. Avoid it at all cost."
1,Like the other guy said; save your money.,"""The whole story of the MC5?"" Well, no, it's not. More like a brief overview of the events surrounding ""Kick Out the Jams."" If you want to know more than that, this ain't the place. ""Back in the USA"" gets relegated to a paragraph. ""High Time"" gets one sentence."
3,Derivative but promising,"This is not the same manifestation of the group that brought us the classicLovelessand Kevin Shields had yet to grasp the near total creative control he would be remembered for with that album. What we've got instead here are seven fairly accessible goth rock-styled tunes led by then-vocalist Dave Conrad's Presley-meets-Danzig baritone. Colm Ó Cíosóig was every bit the frantic percussionist (""Tiger in My Tank""), already beginning to utilize the incessant drumrolls which would continue to plague - or christen, depending on your preference - the group's output some years later. For what little inspiration was present here, however, most of the album is fairly derivative. There wasn't anything single-worthy yet - that would take a bit longer to achieve with a band that had yet to come into their own as true innovators."
2,No love for Dave Conway?,"Why does everyone hate this record? Yes, it doesnt have the beauty of ""loveless"", but it isnt the worst record I've heard. The All American rejects record sounds 10x worse!! Its not ""loveless"" obviously, but it does have its own place in the MBV collection. It does sound like a really bad goth band. The record is fun to listen to and the keyboards are a nice touch. Just because they got a full time bass player didnt mean they had to ditch the keys. Would've worked great. Its funny to listen to. I only gave it two stars because it isnt that great compared to some of the later records, but I dont hate it!! I like this record better than the strokes for crying out loud. People who hate this record because of the ""lack of beauty"" probably only own ""loveless""..."
5,Great for my teens,My boys thought this was a really good book. They thought it was a pretty helpful starter for conversations. Older sister agreed.
3,Even if its for girls...,"...I read this as a guy.This book is a pseudo-biography of their life of girls. Its as if they wanted girls to read the book because they're a popular band as opposed to writing a book with content. If you're looking for advice, this book has very little amounts of it in the ladder end of the book (basically during the relationship section). Basically, the overall book is too shallow and lacked real advice that could be applied for both guys and girls when either being with yourself or friends (guys and girls alike). Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, but I think the Band (and the author who helped) had the target consumer in mind rather than a good book that everyone (not just the female RK fans) would read."
2,Sorry Relient K,"I love Relient K, but let's be honest: bands should not write books. I thought this book might at least be interesting to read, but it's seems like a book for junior-highers or something. This book is not recommended. Sorry Relient K."
2,total dissappointment,"I am a devoted Relient K fan, and when i heard about this book i ordered 3 copies one for me and the other two as christmas presents for my best friends, when i got them in the mail i read mine in 3 hours, and was very unsatisfied. I expected more advice on being a woman of God, and how to be perceived better by boys, and advice on snagging a good boy. I still love Relient K but this book is written more for 13 year old girls, than a 16 christian girl trying to figure out how to fall in love w/ God and a nice guy"
4,Hand Eye Co-ordination Builder,"This is a very exciting action heros game that teachs a little bit about different action heros such as firemen, policemen, water rescue etc... Actually it doesn't teach a great deal about these things but it is a very exciting game with lots of vehicles and adventure. Everything your average boy and tomboy girl love!It was hard to navigate the trucks at first and to figure out where on the screen to click to get the helicopter to unload the children etc... BUT my son who at first needed a lot of help was able to figure out all the kinks in the game witin a couple of weeks and preceeded to go through all the levels and win all 12 medals though he is only 4.I like how there is nothing violent or scary and it's all cute.""Tonka Joe"" keeps praising the childs efforts in a warm way leading my son to say happily""I think that man likes me.""My son's mouse control has become excellent as a result of playing this game."
2,Hard to navigate vehicles,"Tonka has a great idea for kid's software, problem is it is very difficult to line up the vehicles. The cursor jumps the vehicle so you need to go back and forth several times to line up correctly. My three year old doesn't know there is a fault in the software so he blames himself for not being able to do it. I highly recommend Dinosaur 3-D and any of the Disney Activity Centers."
3,On Russian - Èñíí óññèé ñ (áàíàüíñü),"On Russian - Í äñòà, à ìí èòàòü íèíà íà àíèéñì... ñè ò èòàò, íèèèò, à..."
4,How You might walk a Goddess Path,"This was certainly an interesting book. My favorite thing about it is that it included Goddesses from all over the world, not just from a few popular pantheons. (Although some popular ones are certainly represented).The book includes ideas on invoking different goddess energies for different purposes. The chapter on Isis, I found to be particularly inspiring. (I practically wrote an entire ritual for someone who was mourning a family member while I was reading) The book covers all phases of life and includes a pretty good variety of situation-specific information.I found it to be a remarkable book for learning about a variety of Goddesses, but it certainly isn't a comprehensive reference book. It was more about bringing the idea of the Goddess into your life and had ideas on how the Goddess Path can be relevan in your life."
4,Great book - recommended,"I highly enjoyed this book. This author has a great deal of information on different Goddesses. She gives you suggestions for rituals on the different Goddesses as well as a detailed discription of Her. As a male practioner , I found it very interesting. It is geared toward female and male followers. The ONLY reason I give it four instead of five stars is that I wish she had more Goddesses to include."
4,"Good, if you like a little variety","This was the first CD I got from Rennaissance, being attracted to the BT mixed CD. Morales's mix is good house with some soul overtones in the beginning, not bad if you're into house. I love the way the Seaman CD has the good base of trance, but then incorparates 2 great songs by Howie B. and DJ shadow at the end, it's a nice treat to hear the bridge from trance to Shadow's unique hip-hop. The BT disc, which was actually mixed on ProTools and not a turntable, has some low points but overall it's not bad. The overall vibe is prog trance but has a little variation. I love the version of Godspeed that ends the compillation.I have too many mixes to compare to this, other than Sasha, but I'd say it's worth 30 bucks if you can tolerate old-fashioned house and a few other influences next to your trance. If not, buy Oakie or a Sasha mix."
4,"Not a Five Star, Because ...","I agree with a lot of opinions from below reviewers, including that this was Ms. Ferguson's best Regency romance story, but I felt I must subtract one star because I think its mystery plot was a bit weak. The biggest flaw was the first carriage accident when Timothy first discovered Serenity; it was just way too chancy of plot--everybody was dead except the heroine and lost her memory, how convenient, it was just too big of gamble for the villain to plan; and there were few other smaller incidences, although they were more believable of their likelihood, but villain's motive behind them was kind of stretched. So I would say that this was a very pleasant and touching romance story with a Christmas flavor, but can probably leave out its mystery sub-plot."
1,"Another ""Condensation"" Loser","My Model GR-D30U also has the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" problem with less than about 50-75 hours of use. What a Lemon!I should have checked more closely before buying. Consumer Reports shows that JVC camcorders have a poor reliability rating."
2,bad luck,At first i was very happy with my new camcorder.I Took it everywhere and it was very easy to use. I even learned how to use the special effects. But soon i discovered that there was something wrong with it. There was a kind of a spot on the screen and on the picture.Maybe it was a defect which happens sometimes in one out of many new products.Maybe it was just my bad luck to recieve a defected camcorder. i had to return it.
5,Can you call a camcorder sexy?,"This is a standard-issue MiniDV digital camcorder in a very stylish body. While not one of the small pocket-size types -- incidentally those are often awkward to operate and susceptible to hand shakes -- the GRD30 is still small enough to be highly portable. All the standard features of a digital camcorder, from digital tape to fold-out LCD screen to IEEE 1394 ""Firewire"" connections, are there, and JVC also claims superb video image quality. The 16x optical zoom is higher than many other camcorders. (When choosing a camcorder or digital camera, pay ZERO attention to digital zoom claims, since digital zoom is entirely useless. Only optical zoom power counts.)An attractive price, especially here on Amazon.com, makes this a top buy."
1,CALL this number to have camera repaired!!!!,"Found this on JVC's website under CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION...this model is one of the reported ones, hope this helps everyone with this problem...JVC has received reports that in certain circumstances, a small quantity of units of the models listed below, may, while in the camera mode, show no picture, a distorted picture and/or display ""LENS CAP"" even though the lens cap is removed. We have identified the cause as a failure of the CCD image sensor. Until October 1, 2007, repairs of units exhibiting these problems will be made free of charge at JVC Factory Service Centers. Click thisFactory Service Center link to find your nearest location. Please call (800) 858-6442 if you need any assistance in obtaining a free repair. We apologize for any inconvenience and are appreciative of your understanding and support."
3,Good Camera... with some big problemas,"I boight this camera a year ago, at the beginning I was really happy with the movies it can take, and also the capability to export them to any pc just with a standart firewire connection. BUt finlly I got problems with the nighshot (it didnt work at all) and the reason for finally sold it was it started to make heavy noises on the casette compartment, so loud that you could hear the noises in the tape you record. I went to JVC and the didnt gave me any naswer for the problem (I dont have guarantee since I live outside USA)."
1,Condensation lock,"Had the same problem after approximately four years with the camcorder locking up in a pause mode with ""condensation, operation paused"" flashing on the screen. It eventually came out of it but then it happened again and again. I tried to clean the sensor in the tape bay but this did not correct the problem. I think I'l just dump the damn thing and never buy from JVC again. It looks from all I read on the net that they don't even suggest a solution.Too bad for a brand like this"
1,It's a Piece of Garbage,I wish we had read all the reviews before we purchased our JVC piece of junk. After a few short hours we too got an error message about condensation. There is no condensation problem. The problem is that JVC made a defective product and could care less.
1,"Very Disappointed, should've just burnt money spent","We have had the JVC GR-D30 Mini DV Camcorder for a little over a year. It could never be used during humid days outside and not very good for recording a baseball game, and basketball games inside a gym. Not only that, after a little over a year it's broke and will cost $180 to fix and had to pay $30 to find out what is wrong and estimate to fix. The CCD IC Lens Assembly is screwed up. We now are just going to buy a new Camcorder.Definitely steer clear of this brand and model."
1,Defective?,"I've had two of this product in a six month time span. Both stopped working with the SAME error message. The part is under warranty, but labor is not included! It's over 200.00 to fix. I advise EXTREME caution if you decide to buy a JVC camcorder."
1,Too Fragile,"I had my JVC for 4 months now, being a video editor at a kids camp all summer, this camera was set through the paces. Now the ejector is ""finicky"" and the head is pooched. I can't watch tapes in it anymore, and I don't know if its recording. So I am gonna try to get it replaced today. good thing i bought the extended warrenty. gonna try to upgrade it to a sony or something."
1,JVC Does Not Stand Behind Their Products - JVC Lemoncorder,"I agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" defect on their JVC GR-90DU. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.If you are like me and didnt know to research JVC customer support before you bought, and now are stuck with a JVC Lemoncorder model GR-D90U that has this problem, I would encourage you to call the JVC customer support (non-support) phone number 1-800-858-6442 and report your glee at being one of the lucky. I would also encourage you to post your satisfaction on-line.Its especially nice that the local camera repair shop charged 90 dollars to take a shot at fixing it, only to have it go away after the repair shop's warranty period.Do Not Buy JVC camcorders!"
3,Camera is fragile,"I was happy with the camera up until last week. I've had the camera for two months now, and I've been editing on my Mac the whole time with no problems. Then last week my Mac no longer detected my camera, thinking it was the computer, i reinstalled everything, and the comp still didn't detect the camera. I even used a different Firewire cable to see if it was a short int he cable, still no luck. I took it to a friend of mine with another computer and it didn't work there either. There seems to be a short in the camera itself that just won't let the computer read it anymore. Everything else works fine except for that now."
1,Nice camcorder but unreliable,"I've owned this camcorder for just over a year but have only used it for about 10 hours recording time. Now I keep getting a message :'Operation paused, condensation, please wait.' It doesn't go away, no longer how long I wait and I can't use the camcorder as a result. I now have to send it to a repair centre at my own cost to have it fixed, if it can be at all. I like the camcorder itself, it's easy to use etc, but it's unreliable and I'm sorry I didn't pay more money for a more reliable model. It's put me off buying any more JVC products and I think I'll stick to the Sonys or Canons etc, in future."
1,Worst Camcorder Ever,"After two tapes and only a year and a half later the camcorder went into a lock up mode ""Operation Paused Condensation,"" and it will only allow a tape to be inserted after approximately 50 tries. To my surprise, I got absolutely no support from JVC's tech support. What a shame I WAS a very loyal JVC customer. I wished I never had replaced my 7-year-old Sony 8mm camcorder."
5,I love it!!,"I did extensive researches before bought it, and I finally chose JVC GRD30. I'm very pleased with my choice. I had a chance to use Canon ZR65 and this one. I really prefer the JVC better. The indoor picture quality could be better, but it is better than I expected since all the camcorders in this price range are not that good under soft light condition. I love how small and light this thing is! I find the camcorder is easy to operate, and charges the battery in less than two hours~~ Video quality is great when using outdoor; acceptable indoor. Zooming on this thing is powerful. The only two tiny imperfections were a bit noisy on the background when recording silently (you can hear the tape running or something like that)and you kind have to back up when u try to get more stuff into your videos.Overall, money well spent!!"
2,not so great,"this camera is ok. it picks up virtually no sound, its impossible to hear people talking when the tape is played back. most of time you'll have to turn the t.v. volume all the way up just to hear someone talking on tape. you can also hear the motor turning the tape inside the machine in the background. keep looking around."
1,Good for a while and now it is useless to me....,"I bought this camera 18 months ago, after my SONY took a crap after 3 1/2 years (guess I am not meant to record my children's childhood memories!). Being the cost of camcorders came down so much we decided to buy something smaller, instead of paying $$ to get the old one fixed. The salemsan told me that you can't go wrong with a JVC! Yeah Right!!! We went to video my youngest son's first birthday party and we are getting a low light flashing icons, but there is no picture available on my LCD or through the viewfinder. I now have to go through the hassle of having this thing repaired, but after reading everyones comments, I am not sure it is worth having fixed to have something else go wrong with it. I am cursed by the camcorder demon! So my obvious recommendation would be to go with something else!"
5,[....],"Oh lord, when I first put this CD in my player, it was like the heavens opened up and a bunch of angels smiled down upon me. Every single song on this CD is awesome. Matt is a complete genius. As soon as I finsished listening to it, the first time, I picked up the phone and called my mom (whom I haven't talked to in ten years...long story) and told her that I loved her. If you don't buy this CD you're insane...I will come to your house and sleep on your living room floor until you buy it. BUY IT NOW!!!"
5,...,"....Well, let me tell you, when i got home and put that c.d. in, i was one happy camper. Literally. He is really talented and you can tell he puts heart into his lyrics. I wouldn't even doubt it if it was autobiographical... especially that dustbunny one... wow. A tear comes to my eye... SO i would definitely recommend this c.d. to others... in fact, i think ill go plug it right now!"
5,jigsaw puzzle,"I don't really consider this puzzle a ""toy"" as was categorized!! It is one of the best of the White Mountain puzzles - challenging, fun and educational. If you are a puzzle lover, buy this!!!"
5,A lost Genius,"The Great Sonny Bradshaw, arguably the most influential Jamaican musician - so far - died recently and anything that you can get of his rare recordings should be treasured. His arrangements swing, and while every track may not live long in the memory, there are true musical gems to be found, loved and treasured.Sonny B - we will miss you and thank you."
5,An amazing experience,"This was the first Cirque du Soleil album I purchased, and it really got me hooked on Cirque. It drew me in, and now escape is looking fairly hopeless, but that's okay!Even at the incredibly high price typical to Vegas gift shops right outside the theater, it was so worth it. The music is just amazing! It has a very interesting combination of soft and smooth sounds and intense sounds. About half the album is very relaxing and perfect for T'ai Chi, a quarter of it is very upbeat and motivating, and the rest is intense and hard. This combination of sounds is beautifully strung together and makes for some great listening.In fact, this album is so good, I'm almost speechless just thinking about it."
5,Mystere's sounds are as beautiful as it's Visions!,"Mystere' was my first Circque Du Soleil experience. One I will never forget. This companion CD is perfect for those who had no time to find a little program or something to bring home from the show. I was amazed and taken by the fact that the music was so beautiful. Here is is in it's LIVE form as beautiful as the day I saw the show.From what I hear this live cd is better than the studio cd also available for purchase. I never heard the studio cd so I don't know. I can say that Live CDs normally are lesser quality but, this disc goes above and beyond to produce one of the best sounding live CDs that continues to enchant me each time I listen to it.Thank you Cirque Du Soleil!"
3,Ok book only.,"This book is not very relevant if you're based in California. It gives you a general idea of what to expect on the test, but I think it's geared more for the East Coast. The basic reading and writing exercises are pretty good; however, the police stuff did not help me at all on the actual test. That's probably because I'm based in CA and the laws are a little different over here. If you're in CA, I suggest you check out other books."
2,Didn't help,"My agency test was totally different from what I was prepared for in reviewing this book. I still passed but nothing on my test was discussed in this book. My actual test questions were more about police procedure and constitutional law. Based on what procedure is for California, which sucked since I'm a cop in Tennessee!"
5,beautiful ring,the setting size and clarity of the stone is amazing. i was really impresed with this ring. i thought it was gonna be cheap looking based onthe price but it isnt. my boyfriend chose a great gift for our one year anniversary. i love this ring
3,It's ok,The ring is ok. The one i recieved was pretty dull. The stone was cloudy and looked like plastic. Everything about the ring is nice except the stone. The lavender has a much better stone so i would suggest buying that one instead.
4,Got What I Paid For,"It was pretty, cheap, had good reviews, so I bought it. I've had it for a few months now, and all the Marcasite stones have fallen out. However, I also wear it every day. Other than that, it's still pretty. The size was pretty accurate, just a little big. I would buy it again for the price I paid on it, probably. It's a cute ring. Just don't expect it to last over six months if you plan on wearing it every day.KST."
5,Very pleased with this purchase,"This marcasite, aquamarine and cz ring was a gift for my sister and she loved it! It is a very nice ring especially for the price."
2,"Interesting, but needs work","Recently, I tried ""The New Era"" CD and found it to be quite repetitive. The first couple minutes were good but it sounds like George need to add some people to his band. A good drum player would really help him out. Other than that, his singing isn't too bad for one person with limited resources but I don't understand why he's being so hyped up."
5,Fantastic Album In Surround Sound!,"This precursor to the recent ""Captain & The Kid"" is a multi-channel wonder. Not only are the original ten songs remastered and remixed, but there are three more otherwise unavailable (in this format) songs added on (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""One Day (At a Time)"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom""). I can't wait for ""Captain & The Kid"" to be remixed in SACD multi-channel!"""
5,Words Cannot describe HOW good this Sounds,"Just received this & IT is amazing, the dynamic's of the 5 channel sound is just Mind blowing for an album of this age. Grab a copy, Get a SACD player & Listen to ""Better Off Dead"" at Full Volume, then go forward and listen to elton's version of ""Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds"" just as demo's. But the whole series of these 5 SACD releases of the Old Elton Catalogue is well worth buying. A M A Z I N G. I thought the SACD / DVD-Audio of Goodbye yellow Brick Road was good - These just set a new Standard."
5,Excellent,Great clarity and wonderful 5.1 mixing. I have bought 6 Elton John SACD's and they are all about as close to perfect high resolution surround sound as they come. HIGHLY recommend!
1,Disappointed,This item never did load on my kindle. This has happened on 2 other books that i tried to purchase. I have not purchased any more as it is such a problem.
3,Chief Inspector Barnaby - Faithful Unto Death. by Caroline Graham,I am not enamoured of the books - I much prefer to watch the videos from the BBC tv. series. Sergeant Troy is much nicer than his character in the books although Barnaby can be a little annoying at times. The fairly predictable plots are offset by the beautiful scenery and quaint villages in the videos.
4,Good reading,Love Caroline Graham's Inspector Barnaby novels for their detail and complex plots without having a lot of blood and guts.
4,We need more Chief Inspector Barnaby novels on Kindle.,We need more Chief Inspector Barnaby novels on Kindle. I have read all three of Caroline Graham's Chief Inspector Barnaby's Kindle books and enjoyed them very much. I hope there will be more of her books available on Kindle soon.
2,The Show is Better,"I think this is the first time I've found a TV show to be better than the book. Firstly, Sergeant Troy is such an unpleasant character, but worse, doesn't seem to serve any useful role in the story, except perhaps as a counterpoint to Barnaby's good qualities. Secondly,it seems that the author's desire to produce an accurate picture of life in the English countryside has trumped the story -- or at least buried it for long stretches. After a while, I began to think that if I were living in a place like that I'd just kill myself right away.... and then, if the author showed me yet again how shallow life was there, that I should just stop reading then and there. The TV series can make that point with one short scene, and then move on. And the show deliberately and ironically places the action against some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. If you're an Amazon Prime member you can stream Midsomer Murders for free -- and see whether or not you agree with me."
3,A good read for a winters day,"I have read and enjoyed all Caroline Graham novels. She specializes in cosy english villages with cold blooded murderers. ""Faithful until Death"" is another fine example. The characters are very well written and I felt I was there in Fawcett Green. Ms Graham kept me guessing until the end as to who the murder was which is why I enjoyed the novel. I recommend curling up in front of a blazing open fire with a warm drink and a Caroline Graham novel as the perfect way to relax."
4,Incisive portrait of English life wrapped around mystery,"Caroline Graham's England consists of close-packed villages surrounded by miles and miles of nothing worth seeing, of hard-working city businessmen and urban coppers looking down their slim trim noses at country people and their insular ways, of village bobbies who know the villagers and the cycles of the seasons but naught about investigative work, and of quaint self-assured English eccentrics and villagers whose lives rarely extend beyond the boundary line. I don't know if they exist in Cool Britannica today, but in Graham's world, their constricted lives, hidden passions and occasionally murderous impulses make fascinating reading."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I was intrigued at first by this mystery, but found the solution -- or lack of one -- unsatisfying. I have read most of the other Barnaby and Troy mysteries, and am finding the character of Troy to be increasingly distasteful. Graham may think his mysogyny and homophobia is amusing in a cantankerous way, but it borders on the offensive. I'm not a member of the P.C. police, nor do I have an automatic disdain for tasteless humor, but I find nothing redeeming or entertaining about Troy."
4,Entertaining and surprising-a modern day mystery.,The level-headed detective and awkward sergeant make the journey to the conclusion of the case entertaining. The story has surprises and witty commentary about uncommon habits and personality types. Very enjoyable.
2,"Indiglo is useless with ""Hidden Image""","I got this watch because I like analog watches and I need the Indiglo feature - but I wanted to try and get away from the boring, plain -dial Iniglo styles. Well, what the description does not say is that the ""Hidden Image"" - which is visible only when the Indiglo function is pressed - is a dark design that makes it very difficult to read the time. Though it looks good, I cannot really use this watch for its intended purpose so it sits on my dresser - and will probably end up on ebay."

4,"a windfall of hope, anticipation and emotion","A truly endearing film with a brilliant performance by John Shea(!). With touches of The Graduate and lighter borrowings from The Big Chill this film is one of my all-time favorites simply because the performances truly evoke from the audience a love for the characters and the desire to see them, somehow, succeed. Mostel and Shea's interaction and performances are subtly emotional but highly accessible. The love story is also very credible and the actors have wonderful chemistry. I prefer John Shea's performance in this picture to any of his others, including MISSING. The director's brilliant weaving of the characters makes this film entirely credible. You actually feel like one of the guys!"
2,separates and leaves thick muck at bottom,"Not impressed at all. Flavor is not great, but worst of all I noticed that there was a thick layer of muck at the bottom of the bottle that no amount of shaking could dislodge. That means the stuff that I am pouring out is missing a whole load of stuff that is stuck at the bottom. Won't be buying this again."
3,"Simple, solid, good, but IntelliJ is better","I have been using it for a couple of months now. Much simpler than VisualAge for Java. It does everything I need. Good debugging, good editor, decent GUI builder. Source control integration could be better, though. This is for people who like an open environment.Update (one year later) : I am now using IntelliJ. Much better ! Forget about CodeWarrior. It's not bad, but IntelliJ is clearly superior."
5,All women should read this book!,"Whether you are a size 2 or a 22, all women would benefit from reading this book. It was practical, and extremely well written. I laughed a lot while reading it, and I also found myself thinking ""I think she wrote this book about me, and several other women I know."" I recommended it to my sisters, and friends. They all love it too. This book has completely changed my outlook on my body, and how I view others. Dr. Linda should win an award for speaking truth! THANK YOU!"
5,Excellent,"The title caught my eye and once I got it, I couldn't put it down. It has some excellent advice."
1,ABSOLUTE CRAP - ONE STAR UNDER PROTEST,"If you want a book on how to accept God into your life and that you can NEVER lose weight or be happy without God then this is the book for you. I really wish that the description said something about this little detail. If I wanted a guilt lecture I would go to church. I threw the book away as soon as I figured out it had no redeeming merits. SKIP THIS BOOK, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,What a waste,"With in 2 pots of coffee worth of use, all the glue that held this piece of garbage together let go. This showed me why my coffee cooled off so quickly, there is nothing to insulate it. The only thing that is stainless steel on this is the VERY, VERY thin outer skin. I'd give a rating of 0 stars, but Amazon doesn't have that option. Don't buy this mug."
3,Calif history buffs will be delighted with this information,"Great for nature educators in California. Short, consise and nice graphics."
5,Worms 2 is the Epitome of Addiction,"I have played all the Worms games, and Worms 2 is undoubtedly the best. Except for the addition of a few weapons, Worms Armageddon lost some of the settings that made Worms 2 so remarkably fun. Furthermore, more people worldwide play Worms 2 over the Internet than its successor. Buy this game and you will be glued to your seat."
4,Slimy fun!,"I was introduced to worms by a CS best friend of mine (a man of course) who is into video/PC games. I have to admit that I quickly became addicted to playing this game. The ""worms"" are hilarious. You can choose your own team names and voices--which another friend of mine remarked that it was almost more fun than playing the game itself. Worms is a great game that you can play alone or with other people including over a network."
4,A great party game.,"One of the best games of it's type, great for blowing off steam. It offers great control over the game, It's missing a star becuase of the replay value, after a while even gross distruction gives way to wanting something more."
3,Inet,This game is awesome where else can u kill little worms with bazookas or the Holy Hand Grenade from the Holy Grail movie. Plus the internet capiblity is great since this game is worldwide you can play people that dont speak your language!
2,Good Movies But I am Diappointed,I received several Hallmark movies for Christmas because friends know that I enjoy many of the Hallmark movies. But when I watched the movies I was extremely disappointed.When I watched the movies on TV they were captioned in English for the hearing impaired. I am one of those with this problem because I am going deaf. NONE of the Hallmarkmovies on DVD that I received have subtitles in English for the hearing impaired. I am extremely disappointed in Hallmark. I expected better of them.All the movies are good and enjoyable. But these I may not be able to enjoy for long.
4,Excellent family films,These are excellent family friendly films that try to teach lessons. Each film is somewhat short (shorter than full length movies) but well worth the money.
4,Hallmark movie 4 pack,There are four movies in this set of Hallmark movies. Great for family viewing.
1,This one's going back,"The atlas is incomplete. It is missing maps of many areas. The design is haphazard, the index lacks many of the places in the atlas, and I can't see many cities and features becasue they are down inside the binding."
2,"There are much, much better books on this subject.","I agree with the first review, and there is definitely some Canadian bias, as the first reviewer pointed out. Don't believe it? Check out page 154 in the hardcover edition. The blurb written on that page, quoting a famous Canadian coach, is not only totally biased but completely ludicrous!"
1,Dazed and confused. This book is hardly a celebration...,"When I received this book, I was thrilled by the wonderful photographs of skaters from around the world. However, some of the text of this book left me dazed and confused. The author of this book is Canadian, and for some inexplicable reason, she felt the need to put down skaters who are not Canadian to make skaters from her home country look better. She then gave the book a title that would make the reader think that it celebrated the sport and all of its stars. Dissing some skaters to uplift others is a ""celebration""? Hmm.. Go figure. Don't waste your time or money with this drivel."
2,"It's Okay, but not my favorite","This book has many nice photographs and for that reason would be a nice addition to a skating library. Unfortunately it is somewhat lacking in substance and textual content. As for the ""bias"" issue raised by other reviewers, I say ""what do you expect?""....after all the author is Canadian!"
2,should have been better,"This is a very good poem and pretty well read by Richard but the music ruins it.Its like all ""words of wisdom""a religion of music and chanting forms around them and eventually an ideology."
5,Something Remembered,"I remembered hearing The Prophet being played by my mother in the house many times in Jamaica W.I,by the way i was born in Jamaica W.I on December 23, 1970 and The Prophet came out i think in 1974(knowing my mother she stills has the album somewhere). But as kids i did not understand what it meant hearing the music and the spoken words together or why our mother loved listening to it, but for some strange reason years later i would always remember hearing the strange music with the man talking over it. Not knowing the name of the album or the person speaking i asked my older brother about 2 to 3 weeks ago if he remembered hearing our mother playing some strange music when we were kinds and to my surprise he knew it. Just thought that i would share that.Thanks."
4,Coel Shows Her History Roots,"Margaret Coel, the prolific author of the Wind River Reservation mystery series shows her history creds in this biography of Chief Left Hand. Many of her mysteries have a link to history and this work shows she does her homework and is good at it. It is an interesting look at the Anglo/Indian relationships on the high plains during the mid nineteenth century. Her research is thorough and impeccable. She tells the story of a man looking to protect the people for whom is is responsible in the face of shattering change. Her use of newspaper and personal accounts as well as government reports to bring the story to life. It is a tragedy that is a synecdoche for the entire western relationship, and she reports what happened and lets the chips fall where they may. A great read."
4,Good one,Yes it is absolutely fine book like new. Little crack inside. But that does not make any difference. Everything is awesome
5,Great Book,"Comprehensive treatment of the subject, very clear and easy to understand. Also has advanced topics."
2,More misplaced 'info' from an old Cold Warrior,"Richard Pipes was in Ronald Reagan's administration, simple facts state that he is an old cold warrior. Through his hatred for the communists and Lenin (no doubt Lenin was a ruthless man), he gives too many one-sided and biased accounts of Lenin. Perhaps Pipes should know that Lenin tried to please non-Russian nationalities of his empire programs such as Ukrainization, he even forgot communist ideology for one moment when he set up the New Economic Policy allowing his starving countrymen to sell their products and keep the money. The main thing Pipes is good for is history of Russia before the October Revolution where he is deprived of his prejudices."
5,Amazon when will you ever get this in stock?,"I see that there is one in stock and I am sure the computer thinks it doesn't need to order more, but you see most cars need more than one spark plug. Could you please order more? Thanks."
4,Why is there only one plug in stock,"I got the plug type from the owners manual. Your website told me that this was the incorrect plug for my truck. Then I was directed to a selection of plugs that included the exact same plug but at a higher price. What gives?? Of course, even if it had been designated as correct, I would need 6 of them and there is only one in stock."
1,Very dissapointed.,"Theres no doubt about it, this monitor sucks.It's been giving me trouble ever since I bought it.I sent it back but never got my money!"
4,okay,"A little long in shipping and they are not as long as stated. They are about 3 inches shorter than my 84"" curtains, but they look nice."
2,Not worth the money,"This book looked very intresting by the description on the back. The readers are promised answers to many paranormal and conspiracy related questions, but what we get is a long-winded introduction that more or less ridicules those people who chose to believe some of the topics listed. Nothing is ever answered, topics are just listed matter of fact with no real depth to any one subject. The author calls these topics, ""varying degrees of human greed, fear, and stupidity."" (Pg. 27)The author never takes a diffinitive stand on anything. There is a big market for paranormal books out there and it seems as though the author wanted to strike while the iron was hot, but not knowing what he believes in just chose to list things out instead of stick to anyone topic.Any real paranormal buff would not find this worth the time or money."
3,I buy them by the case,"I have a pool and 3 large dogs. I buy them by the case but noticed that they aren't as sturdy as they once were and don't last as long as they used to, but it's the only floating toy my labs will fetch in the pool. I take the squeaker out because the toy holds water and makes it heavier for the dog to catch, hurting the dogs mouth. I prefered the old straight design without a squeaker."
1,Not Shipped Actual Item,"We ordered what is shown and received the Air Dog with the Squeaker which is not this item. I emailed All Pets Considered and received a reply stating that the description states that there is a squeaker stating I was incorrect. I have replied showing them the link and that this is not in the description. We have purchased this actual item previously (store no longer carries it), and it is a great product. It is much stronger than the squeaker Kong and lasts a much longer time."
2,Not as it appears!,"There were several problems with this clock/radio. The first being it is very hard to set up. It said that it comes set with time and date but mine didn't. The soothing sounds are strange noises, not soothing. And... the worst part is that I cannot read the time at night. The time is in black with a light in the background and is impossible to read from any distance. I was disappointed in this product. The clock really looks nice but is not practical!"
2,"aaaaarrrggghhh, shoe looks cheap cheap",The real shoe looks kindda not too classy. Even the sole has this 'fashion' word imprinted on it. Gave it away.
2,Very nice looking shoe but smell awful!,Purchased 2 pair of these shoes on 2/05/09 and when I received it and opened the box the shoes smelled like kerosene or gasoline very bad. I figured it would go away after I aired them outside but the smell remained. This was not only noticed by myself as my co workers actually noticed it as well. It actually gave me a headache and burned my eyes while sitting at my desk at work. I wouldn't suggest buying this shoe unless you can put up with the smell along with your co workers.
4,Zengara White Dress Shoes,"The shoes, as one would expect, were very stiff when they first arrived (I bought them new) and took a lot of use to break them in. The front starts to wrinkle as you use them more but you can't beat the price considering it would have cost me more money to rent a pair of white shoes than it was to BUY these shoes (including shipping!)."
3,Good Vocabulary,"You won't learn to speak the language, but you can pick up quite a bit of good vocabulary with this CD rom. It fails to connect the dots, giving words but not much of their usage."
1,I've been saying this for a while...,"Where's the revelations? And what the -hell- is going on with Vertumnus? Where did he come from? And is he an avatar or what? This book is simply awful; it's by far the worst Dragonlance I've ever encountered. Micheal Williams is an excellent poet... however, his books (and short stories) aren't the best. I found myself falling asleep -constantly- with it's wandering, crappy plot. DON'T LET THE COVER ART AND TITLE FOOL YOU."
3,Sturm Brightblade- Elite Warrior,"This book takes a look at the hero Sturm Brightblade before he meets up with the other Heroes of the Lance. Though not a true paladin, he had very similar paladin like beliefs. He wears the ancient armor of his fathers and has a two handed sword +3. I researched he never was actually a real knight, but at all times a squire. Sturm meets his end in the Dragons of Winter Night book. He would father Steel Brightblade with arch villain Kitiara; Steel would become an evil Knight of the Lily."
2,Too many contradictions with other dragonlance books.,"Although I have become used to ignoring contradictions among the Dragonlance books, this little work shocked me with the sheer amount of inconsistencies and errors. It is almost enough to make me wonder if the author even read the original books at all! Though it would take a true dragonlance fan like myself to spot such inconsistencies, I feel that this is one of the weaker books of the rather expansive series. Putting a rather dull spin on Sturm's character, the plot isn't exactly anything to brag about either. And while the summary of the book promises, (as do all other books about Sturm Brightblade), to once and for all solve the mystery about the fate of his father, I have yet to see a book that has, nor do I expect to see such a book in the near future. My advice: find a different book if this is one of your first Dragonlance books. (Sorry about the spelling)"
2,Classic tale intwined with Dragonlance,"This book is an attempt to intertwine some Arthurian storylines into the Dragonlance mythos. Though not terrible, I was a bit upset by the lack of originality. The Dragonlance world has some very unique attributes and forces at work that make for interesting reads, this book, however, was quite low on my list."
1,I fell asleep reading it 3 times,"I will admit it's got some great poetry but it just seemed the author wanted to take the challange in King Aurthur's court and put it into Dragonlance. It could of worked but it was so dragging and boring! It never moved and it had no excitment to it. I had to stop reading since it was a struggle just to continue reading it. I believe the author though, could write some outstanding poetry but should never write a book again unless Margret Weis is right over your shoulder writing it for you! This was the first and only book I could not read because it was so terrible."
2,Weak Addition to the Dragonlance Saga,"Michael Williams is the poet laureate of the Dragonlance saga. But that does not mean he can write a novel. There is a lot of fluff here as Williams brings in a good deal of Arthurian imagery to craft a dull story about Sturm Brightblade that goes nowhere and does nothing to add to the saga. Williams is a well read writer. Anyone who reads his notes in the annotated versions of the Chronicles and Legends can see that he knows Yeats and Rossetti very well. Williams should know that not every poet could transcend poetry (as anyone who ever read the plays John Keats wrote can attest!) and his rhetorical gifts can only go so far. There are some interesting ideas in ""The Oath and the Measure"" but this remains a weak entry in the Dragonlance books and should be avoided as much as possible."
3,"A good book, typical of the Dragonlance Saga","A good book, although you have to be a Dragonlance reader to fully enjoy and understand it. It should be especially interesting to people who enjoy reading about the Knights of Solamnia and specifically about Sturm Brightblade. I would recommend it, but I found it a little confusing."
2,Did not make me like Sturm any more,"This is by far the weakest Dragonlance I've read of the first 5 Meetings Sextet / Chronicles / Legends / Tales I trilogy. Sturm is not one of my favorite characters, and the fairly wandering plot combined with the lack of interesting characters leads to a very tiresome novel. Williams has a neat premise (someone who hates the Brightblades because of their lack of respect for the Oath and Measure) and incorporates his love of music into the novel. However, it never ""clicks."" I never felt in the hands of a skilled storyteller and whisked away to another realm."
5,Candy Land Adventure,"My 4 yr. old son loves this game so much we had to buy a second copy! This game is great for teaching counting, following directions and patterns. I highly recommend to parents looking for a true preschooler game."
3,Please help,"Does anyone know if this will run on Windows 2000, as I bought it and can't seem to get it to work????"
5,Solution to playing with TWO PLAYERS,"My kids love to play this game on our old computer (it won't run on our newer one..) Whenever we select the two player option, the game freezes. Solution: after selecting the two player/team option, hit and hold the F1 key while clicking a few times with the left mouse button. This will work through the hang-up and allow you to pick your characters (each player selects a fruit) and move on with the game."
5,Great game!,"It resembles the board game and is delightful and fun. Really colorful and moves along quickly. Gives child opportunities to solve problems, teaches thinking skills or some puzzle or other task. My kids really enjoy it! Keeps them playing for a long time."
5,Bigwin Inn,"I had been trying to find a copy of this book at a reasonable price for a long time.This is a total nostalgia trip for me, as I worked at Bigwin Inn for 2 summers when I was in college. It really brings back a lot of memories.Unless one has been or worked there, I doubt if they would have an interest in buying it."
2,"Decent for the price, but not as advertised.","The holster shown in the image above has been cased (molded to fit the gun) and the one that was delivered is smooth leather.Also, with my 4 inch k-frame the thumb snap is loose, this makes it more difficult to undo the snap and remove the firearm. It also allows more hammer travel (you can almost fire the gun while holstered).The boning doesn't really bother me but the description should match the product. I DID NOT get what I paid for. The product description specifically says molded.At least the thumb snap issue was an easy fix, just shove a wad of cotton patches in there so the gun rides a little higher..."
4,Perfect for procrastinators!,"I now have 6 of these, the most recent 3 from Amazon with a slightly different, & better, closing mechanism than the first ones. Now that they're reduced, I'm getting more for next year's additional ornament purchases! Taking down the tree wasn't the chore it has been for 30 years, because I didn't have to wrap each ornament (we have hundreds and hundreds) separately. No fun at all, and consequently some years the tree didn't come down till February or even March. Embarrassing. These containers will make the tree easier and more fun to put up because I'll see at a glance all of them and can decide which one to hang where. It's true that really big and wide ornaments don't fit, but 90% of my ornaments did. I gave these 4 stars because the closing mechanism could still be improved, and probably will be in the next generation of the product."
4,Good buy,This is a good buy for the price. Had no problems with the clock.Even the recorder works great. Would definitely recommend it.
5,The real Mc.Coy of Rock and Roll !,This albums are a real tribute to the talent of one of the most original interpreters of this genre of music. His interpretation of Rock and Roll on the piano is unique to him. Well worth adding to any collection. -JM-
5,Jerry Lee's the Man,"I bought this DVD for my Dad for Father's Day. Isn't it funny how music from the 50's & 60's still sound so fresh, while a lot of today's music is stale after two weeks? Jerry Lee is a legend in any circle, his music is timeless and full of energy, he's a real rocker from back in the day. This DVD was recorded in 1986 and is a must have."
4,The Great Jerry Lee,"Jerry maybe older but he still gives a great performance of country songs and his rock n roll favorites. A somewhat mellowed performance but still a good buy for any fans of the killer, picture and audio quality are very good."
2,inferior production,"the sound and picture do not match in a number of places. I sent one back and got another and same thing, so it is a problem with the production. Also, the older Austin City Limits shows do not have the crispness that newer shows have. Norah Jones, for instance, is crystal clear in video and sound. As for the show, the Killer is very good and it is worthwhile."
3,Funny series that mocks robot animes,"Nadesico is a great anime series that makes fun of itself as well as the entire history/genre of robot anime. Taking pieces from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mazinger, Voltron, Star Blazers (aka Space Battleship Yamato) and other series... this show combines action, comedy, drama, and cool character development. Portions of this show go from slapstick comedy (Akito's scene when he runs into Yurika) to deadly serious (Jiro aka Guy's death)."
4,Great shirt,These are large sizes - I ordered an XL and it's very 'roomy'. Probably an L would have sufficed.Anyway - nice light shirt - perfect for a workout. I would buy one again and recommend for excercising.
4,Susan C onant's cat mystery,I thought the book was a bit slow starting...maybe it was just me...I'm used to Holly Winter...but as it went along I liked it better and better.Excellent read.
3,"Clever, but not for every pet-mystery fan","Hilarious? I found The Dogfather hilarious, but I wouldn't use that adjective for Scratch the Surface. ""Clever"" and ""unusual"" seem more apt to me. If you're looking for a typical cat-lover's mystery, you're not going to find it here. In fact, if you're looking for a mystery that recognizes the intelligence of cats or that acknowledges the rapport that true cat lovers have with their feline companions, you're not going to find that here either. On the other hand, if you are sick of mysteries that feature such rapport, or you are just feeling cynical, then you should enjoy this take-off on that genre. Instead of showcasing the intelligence of cats, Scratch the Surface focuses on the intelligence of a mystery author who has become successful pretending to be a cat-lover. I haven't decided whether or not I'll read another book in this series myself, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a cozy-lover who is in the mood for something different."
1,Dissapointment,"I have collected all of Susan Conant's dog mystery books. I read them and pass them around. I was looking forward to this after reading such uplifting reviews. Thump! Down with a crash. I managed to get to the end of the book but it was a struggle. I really hope she goes back to writing about her Malamutes. I don't think I will bother to read another one if her ""cat books"""
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I have read and enoyed Ms. Conant's dog series for many years. So when i saw she had written a cat mystery, I had to give it a read. My main problem with this book is how unlikable the main character comes across. Felcity seems, and I believe is, a fake and very very self-centered. How can you feel any connection to a main character whose first thoughts upon finding a body is how it can work in her best interest.Please, Ms Conant, if you continue the cat series, help us like Felicity a little bit more."
1,What a Letdown,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the Holly Winter books, and was really looking forward to this new venture, especially as I have cats. I've almost finished it, and I can only reiterate what others have said. The protagonist is quite unlikeable--I haven't yet discovered one redeeming quality she possesses. She is self-centered and smug, and possesses no sense of humor.The worst thing, which clearly demonstrates her lack of intelligence, is that she writes books about cats and knows nothing about them. No cat lover, even in the fictional world, would buy books by an author who does absolutely no homework.I hate to make these comments because I have always enjoyed Ms. Conant's work, but this is quite substandard and a big disappointment."
1,Struggling to finish,"Thank goodness I got this at a used bookstore! Felicity, supposedly the ""heroine"" is the most self-centered, selfish character I have read in a book in a long time. She hated teaching, looks with disdain upon her writing club friends and, even though she writes cat mysteries, seems to hate cats! When a dead body is placed at her door all she can think of is how this will help her writing and promote book sales. That's just icky. A cat is left with the body. When Felicity takes it to the vet, all she worries about is that when the vet will find out the identity of the body before her and steal her thunder. Even ickier.I don't think I will even bother finishing, it doesn't look like it was successful enough to spawn a sequel... Don't bother with this one!"
3,Bring back Holly,"Big Susan Conant fan for many years, I've enjoyed her entire Holly Winter's series.Scratch the Surface is a hundred-eighty degree turn around from the somewhat believable, always enjoyable, dog obsessed Holly Winter's mysteries. Now we have a totally unbelievable, thoroughly unlikable, idiot named Felicity who has based her career on her lack of knowledge about cats. Some authors are good at humor and some are not. When it works it's great, but it's difficult to carry off well. Susan Conant doesn't have the knack for it. The reader shouldn't have to play ""guess who the author is spoofing"". If this novel is a big inside joke, it's lost on me."
2,Those poor cats,"I just finished Scratch the Surface, my first Susan Conant book, and was very disappointed. Perhaps Ms. Conant is more familiar with dogs, since she certainly does not do well with the two cats featured in this book. I also found the writing to be childish and almost amateurish, more suited to children than to an adult audience. The plot was nicely convoluted, but the writing style could have definitely been more elevated. This is not a book I would recommend to cat mystery lovers."
2,Cats not the same as malamutes,"While the book is well written, I am very used to Susan's dog mystery books, which I enjoy alot. I did not find the mystery writer an enjoyable or particularily sympathetic character. I did get some insight into an author's life, which was interesting, Susan Conant's love for dogs shines thru the Holly Winter series. But I didn't get the impression that she is a catlover.For part of the fun of an ""animal"" mystery is thinking, my pet does that, or I know a dog/cat like that. While the cats seemed like lovely cats, I wasn't drawn into their personalities. Wait for the second hand copy, if you really want to try it."
4,Good book,Of course I always like books with cats in them. I liked this one better the the Rowdy books. I think I know more about Malamutes then I ever wanted to.
