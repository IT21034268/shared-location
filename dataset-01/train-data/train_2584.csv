1,Not the version you need.,"Be careful. This version is crippled and I unfortunately didn't realize this before buying it. The application support is limited compared to the Professional version. Outlook is not supported in the Preferred version, which doesn't seem to be information that is made readily available. The lack of support for Outlook is completely unacceptable since Outlook is a standard application same as Word (which is supported)."
1,You never stop paying for this product,"When it works well, it's great, but when it doesn't, you're in for it. You can call Nuance for help, but they charge you $10 for the call, even if there's a bug in the program. If there is, you'll call many times at $10 a pop. Invariable the program freezes my computer & I have to restart. They blame it on Service Pack 2 & give you directions on how to disable it - if you can figure out the instructions. This is my 4th attempt at Dragon & I give up. Good luck."
3,hardware sensitive?,"Please add to your reviews, the amount of memory (RAM) your system has, processor speed, and operating system. If unsure then include the year of purchase. There is usually a correlation between quality and hardware when using software of this type (resource hog). Will write/ dictate a review in a few days. Ignore the rating"
3,"Good software, bad headset","I enjoy the software and it does what I hoped it would do, but the headset is large enough to fit a doll. I had to go buy a different headset (one that fits) and then I had no complaints. My suggestion is buy the software WITHOUT the headset because it is cheaper and then buy a headset separately. (if you don't already have one)"
2,the system gets confused,if you have lots of time and patience this product is fair. It quite often does not understand what you say and types words that don't make sense. There are times when you are dictating and it interprets your words as commands and screws up your whole desktop.
3,Dragon Natural Speaking,"I purchased this because my lectures from school were so long I needed a way to get them typed up faster. I thought I could put the mic next to the recorded lecture, and it would transcribe it for me. WRONG! You do have to read quiet a bit of material so it recognizes your speach patteren before it will start typing for you. Then it still gets a lot of words wrong and even when you repeat, repeat, and repeat, it still does not get it wright. Not at all what I thought it would be. Although my daugher has programed it to recognize her voice and does some of her homework this way. I still find it combersome and tireing to try to get it to understand me."
3,bought for a class,"I purchased this for a class that I was taking. I can honestly say that it didn't work as well as it could have. It worked for what I needed it for my class. But, wouldn't purchase it for anything other than that."
3,Why a rate it a 3,"While the product works sufficiently, the rebate is not applicable to this version. Very irritating to be told you bought a full product with an upgrade serial number.It does work fine with Vista and the box made no mention of being an older version.Who is at fault? I do not know.I do know I am out $50.00Be prepared to have your rebate denied."
3,Naturally Speaking,"Basically the same as MS's version, but is easier to train. Still sounds like a machine, and doesn't answer back."
5,A big help for RSI,"This has been a lifesaver for reducing typing related stress to my hands and wrists. Although it doesn't let you forgo typing altogether, it is an invaluable tool for any computer user suffering from RSI."
3,Watch out for the promotion-not all accepted,"The product is very good. Although, we felt we had been deceived on the promotion of receiving a $50.00 refund, if you had an old Dragon product (we had a 6.0 model). When actually it had to be a specific Dragon product code and number. We called the Dragon service department and there was no apology, explanation or anything. Just that the specific items were the only one accepted. Amazon.com was very friendly and apologetic about the misunderstanding but couldn't do a lot to help out. I would suggest that in the advertisement of the purchase of this product, that the corporation specifically gives what is accepted up front, not hidden off on another site"
2,"Very good, when it works","As a longtime (attempted) user of voice recognition software, I was pleased when NaturallySpeaking 8.0 proved to be significantly better than previous versions, so much so that the technology finally became worth the trouble. I was an early adopter of 9.0, and have been equally pleased with its recognition accuracy and speed. Not so impressive is its reliability, and Nuance's technical support is genuinely awful. The program frequently locks up, sometimes returning to usefulness after several minutes, sometimes not. Attempts to find solutions on the company's web site are of no avail, and aside from nearly daily e-mail requests to upgrade to software I purchased months ago, I've received no other useful information. The product would be excellent if it were just a little more reliable."
2,"Must be a ""native"" English speaker.","It works fine for my American born husband, but I was born Chinese. English is a ""second language"" for me (we've been married 35 years and I've lived in the USA and England all that time). Although I speak ""reasonably good"" English, NaturallySpeaking doesn't recognize hardly a word I speak during the ""training phase"" where it's so important to ""train"" the program to the user's voice. I couldn't get through the training, resulting in horrible results when I attempted to dictate on the program. Completely useless for me!"
1,CAUTION: NOT 64 BIT VISTA COMPATIBLE!,"Dragon Naturally Speaking is NOT fully Vista compatible. It is NOT compatible with 64 bit Vista, ONLY 32 bit Vista.(And I don't understand why anyone would want to use 32 bit Vista, considering the fact that ALL computers made today use 64 bit technology!!!)AHHHH!!!! It just doesn't make any sense, and now I can't use Dragon anymore because the official Nuance site DOES NOT mention this incompatibility ANYWHERE! Believe me, I searched the site entirely and it misleadingly claims 'Vista compatible'. This is not true. It won't even install, let alone run on a 64 bit system.Nuance needs to get with the 21st century and make DNS compatible with 64 bit systems."
1,an abysmal disappointment,"I bought this program hoping to dictate away. The speech recognition is markedly improved. However, it has repeatedly fed me error messages for which there is no technical support. I have received no response from Nuance to emails and their product support line was busy.Their online blog had numerous instances of similar problems. I instituted the recommended fix. It seemed to fix that problem.It seemed to be working, then froze my Word document. I exited the program and Word, then reentered them and ran repeatedly into the same problem.I am permanently deleting it now.This program has bugs on top of bugs. I am hoping it hasn't permanently corrupted my Word program.If you like pulling your hair out or are some kind of masochist, this program is for you. Otherwise don't waste your money."
3,great program except for one thing- the user file,"I am a grad student who writes papers all the time. I bought this program 14 months ago after a neck injury which has hampered my typing ability.All in all, I love the program. Once you have done adequate training the software is very capable and does a decent job until the user file gets too big for its capacity. Once it reaches full capacity the user file dies and you will struggle to recreate a new one without losing all of the training you have done with the software. So far the user file has died on me twice. The first time I was able to saving my voice training, the second time I lost everything.I can only hope that Nuance realizes this and fixes it before version 10 comes out. If they don't I will be transferring to Microsoft Vista."
3,hmmm.,this is goos but i dont hink it all that great because the wordsdont get picked up all the time
1,OH WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!,"Nuance - Help - Contact1 Wayside RoadBurlington, MA 01803United StatesTel: 781-565-5000Fax: 781-565-5001I CALLED nuance just to ask about their tech support options and was appalled at the lack of human contact! I write this after having purchased returned version 10, and thinking that possibly version #9 would work! Thank God I took the time to see what I would be getting into!AS WAS SAID BY DEAN ESTUS OF GEORGE MICHAEL FAME: OH WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, WHAT A WASTE, HEAVEN HELP ME!!!"
3,Be Careful Regarding Rebate Offer!!,"If you are like me and do not always read the fine print, be aware of the sneaky rebate offer!! It only applies to people who ALREADY OWN A PREVIOUS VERSION of this software, and who can prove it on top. Otherwise, there will be zero rebate! This bothered me about the company (Nuance).. you really need to dig around to find this little piece of information."
3,Dragon 9.0 is OK for a single user,"Our agency recently purchased the Dragon 9.0 Naturally Preferred Speaking to use for transcription of various types of meetings where multiple voices are recorded. Our executive director purchased the Sony MP3 with the Digital Voice recorder and it works very well at the meetings. However, when you team up the Dragon 9.0 to work with the Sony Digital Voice Recorder for transcription, it does not recognize all the voices in the room at those meetings. Therefore, it is my conclusion that the Dragon 9.0 is well suited for a single voice/user for dictation and transcription utilizing the commands learned for using the Dragon and not for multiple voice transcription at a board or staff meeting. We will most likely return the product for a refund."
2,Bring on the patches,"This product does not work with internet applications as advertised. There are multiple inconsistencies in the way it handles commands, or in its ability to carry out the commands at all. My computer exceeds the minimum requirements of this program. Additionally, I am unable to check for updates to the program as I get 'error 13003: not registered' even though I have registered twice now. I'm actually typing this review with the keyboard because of problems in IE and Firefox. They also charge money for support. Dictation for other purposes works very well, I just wish it did everything it was advertised to do."
1,Abysmal customer service and support,"My laptop crashed and had to reinstall Dragon Naturally Speaking 9.0 on it. Unfortunately Disc-1 was damaged. I opened a ticket on Sep-8 and up to today (Oct-11) am still unable to convince Scansoft Customer Service that the disc is damaged despite the numerous tests that I had done (as per their instructions). It also takes days for them to respond to emails. Not sure when and if they'll actually send the replacement. If you decide to buy this product and rely on it for business, you'll definitely need to consider making copies (that is if the end user license agreement allows this - not too sure about that)."
3,BUYER EXPERIENCE,"Unfortunately, as I speak with a non-Americn accent, this product did not work for me at all. However, it seems to be a good product for the person with a typical American accent! It was user friendly and has good features."
1,Impossible to rate fairly,I purchased this on 9-15-07 with their 30 day money back guarantee. When I recieved the product the return policy says software must be unopened to recieve full refund. Rather than risk losing 20% I just returned it. They have acknowledged recieving it but to this day I have not reieved my refund. Have inquired twice and no results
5,Awesome,"I'm dictating my review right now. I just started using the program today, yet I'm already comfortable with dictation. I'm surprised at how readily the program recognizes even obscure words. My only advice is to check your system requirements and make sure you have adequate RAM prior to purchasing(I had to purchase more for my computer). I'm sure once I'm accustomed to using the program, I will love it even more."
5,"Wow, What an Eye Opener!","This is truly a well written book. Often there were times I could not put it down and other times I became so emotionally exhausted I would have to catch my breath at the end of the page. As a working mom that is somewhat open-minded to the world and its surroundings, I found this to be a shocking realization to the exploitation and inhumanity that can prevail all around us. Although it is quite graphic, the story could not be told in any other way. Ms. Mainor gives the only justice possible to the main characters she presents so completely and passiontately. Well Done!!"
4,Commodity Trading a story of White Slave Trade,"Even though I am not a fiction fan, I must say this book really keeps your interest. It introduced a side of life I was not aware of. It was easy reading that was hard to put down. If this is a sample Ms. Mainor has a promising future."
2,stopped working,"After owning the phone for 9 months, it stopped working. I followed suggestions in manual (yes, I kept it!) with no results. I then went to the web site and tried all suggestions. No success. It is just dead. Guess I'd get something different."
3,"Basic, feels cheap, good sound quality, weird smell.","This phone is very basic, and the plastic feels light and cheap. However, it has great sound quality, which was my main requirement. It has a weird plastic smell (the black color...not sure if the white does), which is a quality I've been coming across in black plastic lately. Sadly, it's made in China, but what can you expect for a cheap phone."
3,Simple but probably not too durable for major use,"My family owns a business where we have A LOT of phone calls and while we appreciate the simplicity of these phones and their attractive yet plain looking exterior the durability is questionable. However this is probably the 3rd time I had to replace the phone, if only they made a durable edition.Pros:Great call quality and callers come through crisp.SimpleNo battery neededCon:Not as durable as hoped."
5,"Excellent quality, low price",I wanted a simple phone that would continue to work when the power goes off. I am pleased to say this phone meets my expectations. The sound quality is excellent and it has already seen me through one power outage.
5,"No bells or whistles, it's just what we need for power outages","We have three cordless phones in the house, but we've always kept one hard-wired phone to use when the electrical power goes out. (The power lines in our area are aboveground, but most telephone lines are underground. During storms, we often lose electrical power, but the phone lines are usually intact. The cordless phones, which require AC power, are useless at those times, but a hard-wired phone still works.) When our hard-wired phone recently died after about twenty-five years of service, we replaced it with the AT&T; 210 Corded Phone. It's a fine telephone, reminiscent in style of the old AT&T; Princess Phone of the 1960s, but modernized with memory-dial. Other than that, it's pretty much a basic, bare-bones telephone, which is what we need during power outages.The AT&T; 210 appears to be solidly built, and we expect to get many years of service from it. For the very low price, it meets our expectations perfectly."
1,best corded phone currently,"This is the best corded phone I've ever had, but it has 2 following drawbacks:1. Buttons on black handset are hard to discern, since they are dark grey. They must be white at least partially (partially - because they are designed to transmit light in the dark).2. Sound of beeping is very weak when pressing keypad buttons during dialing."
4,Basic Phone,"This is an ok basic phone, which is what I wanted, in case my electricity goes out. Works fine."
3,"It works well, but cannot be mounted on a wall",The receiver keeps falling out of the cradle of its own accord if you try to wall mount this phone.Edit: See P. Kenny's comment and my response. It is very likely that I overlooked reversing the handset tab for wall-mounting.
2,Static Static,"The AT&T cordless transmitted a lot of static. Also it was not wall mounting friendly. Therefore, I give it a low rating."
3,Reliable telephone. Sound quality not great.,"I needed a replacement for a phone that died on me. This one was low cost. I got what I paid for. This is an extension I pick up occasionally. The sound quality is not great, but within reason for an extension. Rugged design and seems to be exactly what I wanted."
5,It's a phone,it hangs on the wall...It rings...I answer..I mutter vague obscenities..I slam it down....takes a beating..keeps on ringing.....What more is there to say...
2,If you pay peanuts ...,"Well, you know what they say ... if you pay peanuts you'll end up getting monkeys.There is nothing to like about this product, except it's price.Everything else is cheap:- Cheap material- Cheap backlit dial pad- Ringer does not work every time (I don't know why though)But to be honest with you, I was expecting this...Bottom line is that I really didn't like it, but since I am using them as cheap back-up they are performing as expected."
4,"Good cheap phone, but the cord is too short","Got this phone for all our power outages that we have. Can't use those cordless during those times. Unfortunately people call when our local grid goes out all the time, when most the area stays on, and they can't get through. It's a back up phone. The sound is a little tinney, but hey, its inexpensive. But the cord is just too short imo. You really have to stay or sit right next to the phone b/c of its length."
2,Can't use as a wall phone,"This phone would probably work well as a desk phone. It seems to be well made. Due to a design flaw, the receiver will not stay on the base."
1,Horrible,"The phone itself is cheap, which is a plus. The usage, however, is also cheap. It distorts sound worse than a cordless, which I as trying to avoid, and randomly hangs up on people. As I use this phone for a business purpose, this is detrimental. I do not advise the purchase of this phone."
2,NOT the ATT 210 phone I am used to,"I have two other ATT 210 Trimline phones. I like them a lot. I like the lighted buttons in the handle and the solid construction with the heavy base.This newer version is very poor in comparison. Only some of the buttons are actually lighted and the lighting is very dim on those that are. Its feels too lightweight, especially the base. The construction quality seems very poor.I wish I could buy the same phone built in the same way as my older ones."
5,great basic phone,"I had no trouble programming long-distance numbers, and even my calling card number, into the phone (yes, the calling card number required two of the pre-sets, one for the phone number and one for the PIN, with a manual pause in between).When I made an error during the programming phase, I had the same experience as the person who couldn't get it to program. The key is to press (1) program/mute (2) memory (3) the preset assignment (4) the telephone number (5) program/mute.My intuition kept trying to override and press program/mute or memory in between the preset assignment and the telephone number, which caused the phone to both dial, and then not have retained the programming.Hopefully if the person with the programming trouble tries once more, it will work.My ONLY complaint about the phone is that I can't turn the volume quieter than the ""normal"" setting, the opposite of the phone it's replacing."
1,Not a good experience,"The phone arrived quickly and was easy to just plug in and go - tested it out the first day we had it and it worked perfectly - making calls and receiving calls. A few days later, I picked up the phone to use it and there was no dial tone - just an annoying buzz. Tried using a different cord, that did nothing. Plugged another phone in using the cord from this phone and it worked fine so it is definitely the phone that is malfunctioning.... the phone seemed very light and cheaply made - definitely would not recommend it."
2,Corded Wall Phone,"I purchased this one to replace an identical one that suddenly stopped working after owning less than 1 year. Rather than repackage and pay shipping costs I purchased a new one. The programming feature does not work, but since it isn't a necessary requirement, I'm keeping it."
2,Not as good as my old Conair phone,"Sound quality was down and keypad lighting was inferior compared to my old Conair phone. I also found the electronic tones to indicate a ringing phone to not be to my tastes. I guess AT&T; forgot how to make a basic phone. Folks, go to a garage sale and find the phone you like for $1 or less. The only positives I have to say about the phone is that it looks nice in shiny black and that the part of the headset that sits by my ear is fairly comfortable in the ""old classic phone"" way. Two nice things to say means 2 stars.Why oh why did Conair quit making phones?"
4,great look,"I purchased this phone as a back-up to the wireless system I currently have, in the event of a power outage. It perfectly fits the bill."
4,AT&T 210 Trimline Phone with Memory Dialing (Black),Excellent phone. The only flaw is that the receiver slides off the base too easily when wall-mounted. A few small pieces of electrical tape seems to work fine.
3,an okay phone,Not a bad phone. Has memory and a species of backlighting. The main drawback for me -- feels big and clumsy in the hand compared to my old Chinese model. I recommend the Uniden Slim1100BK. Very basic but really slim and still has a volume control and a redial.
3,Bargain Shopper,"I purchased this phone for our garage, so I did't want to put a lot of money into it. I am pleased with it, the only thing it does not light up the numbers , although it said it was a lighted dial phone. I would recommend this if one does not want better quality. For the price...not too bad!!"
1,What a waste,Sure got what I paid for. Never could use it from the day I got it--the prongs were wrong and the phone would not hook into the wall-receiver. Costs more to send it back than it did to buy it!
4,Cheap and Does the Job...,We have 7 phones in our house and a corded one needed replaced.... this guy solved the problem. light up keypad!
1,UNHAPPY,"I AM VERY UPSET THAT MY ORDER DID NOT COME UPS AS SPECIFIED, AND NOT THE POST OFFICE. I AM HANDICAPPED AND CANNOT GET TO THE POST OFFICE AS I WOULD LIKE. I WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING AGAIN.THANKS,GLENDA"
2,Not a wall phone,"Purchased this phone because the description said it could be mounted on a wall. It does mount on the wall, but the receiver keeps falling out of the cradle. This is NOT a wall mount phone--I have tried various things but nothing works. It's a great phone for desk, bedside table or counter use, but do not buy it if you need a wall mounted phone."
1,NOT A WALL PHONE!!!,"I feel like I should yell this out. In my home, we have a very basic wall phone. This phone seemed to fit the bill. However, when I hooked it to my wall, the receiver would not stay connected to the base. Therefore, my phone was off the hook constantly. Not a wall phone, desk phone...would be perfect."
4,Ok,The phone works. A little heavy and awkward to hold over long periods of time. The phone feels flimsy compared to the 1970s model but oh well. The sound is very good for an inexpensive phone and a good choice for an inexpensive corded phone option.
4,Looks and works great,"This black phone looks nice, feels substantial, and works exactly as advertised. A good value. The sound quality is good. You can turn the ringer off."
1,Horrible sound quality,"I bought this thinking, ""It's from AT&T, how can I go wrong?"" However everyone I talk to asks if I'm on a cell phone and if the reception is bad where I'm at."
2,Faulty line cord,"Phone would not function. Tested the phone circuit with another phone; it was fine. Nothing worked on the new phone so figured it had to be the line cord. I had an old line cord at my home, so I used it. The phone now works fine now."
1,poor quality product and did NOT work,very poor quality and seriously will not buy this ever again. I opened the phone and connected it and it's not even working. Can't make phone calls. I have to give one star because System doesn't allow me to give zero stars.
4,Seems fine for the price,"Needed to replace the phone in our bedroom and wanted a basic non-electric phone so if the power goes out I can still make calls. Just got this phone this week so I can't give a detailed review but it seems like it will do the job. I did purchase one for my mom a year or so ago and she has not had any problems. Pros: price, memory features - one touch and speed dialing. Cons: I was expecting it to be more substantial like the old princess phones from the 70's but this model is very light weight and I am a little concerned that my rambunctious cats will knock the handset off the base."
5,Everything I need is here.,"Boy, you can't beat this phone, especially for the price. I'm using it as a bedside phone so portability is no issue for me. Plug it in and it works immediately. No batteries to charge, no waiting. And it's so simple to store your frequently called numbers. The backlighting for the buttons isn't very bright, but you can still see them in a darkened room. No bells or whistles...just a standard easy to use phone. Maybe the old ways are best after all."
3,"Plastic and cheap, works","Title says it all. Not the heavy well made phone you may have had back in the day, but it works the same."
2,Not usable,"I bought two of these phones based on the reviews. However, when I used them there was too much static on the line, and the sound was neither clear nor loud. I ended up buying a GE Caller ID Trimline phone which worked much better for my needs."
2,Hurricane Sandy -power outage beware !,"I bought 2 of these phones about a year before Hurricane Sandy. With our extremely lame and incompetent LIPA (Long Island Power Authority) switching the power off, then with several attempts to put it back on, the ringer (high setting) was destroyed. The phone still rings, but I can barely hear it on the high setting. I think this is common with some phones, as I recall this happening before with other phones.I will buy another wall phone similiar to it, if I can find one. The other one, I never have the ringer on it anyway, just use it as an extention in the bedroom, I will keep. Otherwise, it's a good phone. My husband is severely hearing impaired, and uses hearing aides. He can hear just fine (voice) but not the ringer since the storm."
2,Lightweight,Too lightweight but otherwise o.k. The base is so light if falls on the floor easily. Should be heavier to stabilize.
3,Works fine sound it OK.,definitely lighter weight than the older ones doesn't feel as solid but sounds fine. Tab doesn't seem to stick out far enough to use it as a wall mounted phone without the receiver falling off so the is kind of a negative.
2,"Muffled receiver, callers cannot hear me","After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this basic phone for my home.The only problem is though I can her everything callers say, everyone that I have talked to on this phone says that they can't hear me and that I sound muffled. When I try to speak louder and directly into the receiver, while even cupping the receiver at times, people can usually understand me better but not as clearly as they should be able to.Overall, it's not worth the price spent on it because it doesn't function correctly."
2,dial tone,"I have trouble getting a dial tone when I pick up the receiver,If I use the speaker I always get a dial tone so I know it is the phone."
1,Defective phone - AT&T 210,"Unfortunately there was considerable background noise with this phone, and the voice quality was so poor that it was difficult to carry on a conversation with someone. We had to request a refund."
2,get what you pay for,Phone is standard and what I expected. However the lines to the jack and the handset do not fit well and have a tendency to disconnect and fail to connect tightly. Can be solved if you have some old lines around to use instead of the ones furnished with the phone.
2,Wall phone,I went on line and specifically put in wall phone. I needed a phone to go on the wall in my kitchen. What I got was a desk phone that is to small for the wall. Didn't need a desk phone so wish I hadn't made the prchase.
4,Good customer service,"So I bought this phones to hang in my shop over my crowded workbench. Discovered that although the BASE certainly was, I couldn't get the handset to stay in the base when in a vertical position. The phone is made in overseas, and appears to be a redesigned copy of the original (indestructible) Trimline.So, I sent off an email to AT&T; Customer Service, not really expecting any response. I was surprised the next day when I got an email response. This was followed by a phone call from a technical expert. After some discussion, I downloaded a PDF file that showed that a little plastic hook, located under the directory card on the handset, needed to be removed and re-inserted a special way to hold the handset when the phone was wall mounted.Apparently, several of the latest AT&T; designs require some manipulation of the base or a small hook to enable wall mounting."
1,Wish I could give a -5 stars,"People, when you read others comments about the cheapness of this phone. Believe it!I did not....I thought how could the ole ATT phone I grew up with be such a pile of junk.....BUT IT IS....Returned the next day and Amazon refunded my money right to my account before I even shipped the package to them.Problems:TOO LIGHTWEIGHT/FLIMSYLIGHTED BUTTONS TOO DARKCOULD NOT HEAR CALLERS NO MATTER WHAT LOUDNESS SETTING CHOSENPlease do not waste your time. If you are over 35 years old this is not the phone you remember."
4,Good phone,"Nice low-price and low-tech phone. Keypad is backlit by power from the phone line (no need to plug it in or to use batteries). Ringer can be turned up, down, or off right in the side of the handset which is nice if you have sleeping kids. Handset is comfortable to hold against ear. To hang it on a wall, a small plastic part in the base must be removed, flipped, and reinserted otherwise the handset falls out of the base. My only minor complaint is that the handset doesn't really 'click' into the base solidly even after reversting the part that hold it there. It feels like it might possibly fall off in an earthquake...but maybe not. This is the only thing causing me to give it 4 stars instead of 5. Anyway, I'd buy this phone again if I needed another."
2,Disappointed with this phone,"This phone is okay for emergencies/short conversations. During the one call I made on it, there were repeated, annoying interruptions bystatic that was audible to me and the other party."
2,As advertised!,"This is advertised as being okay for use as a wall phone. It works just fine, but make sure you read the directions regarding how to turn the base's tab around... to make the phone usable for hanging on the wall."
5,Great!,"I purchased this telephone to use with my Magic Jack. The phone works perfectly. It has an option to make the volume loud or normal. I wanted something basic, cheap and most importantly reliable. I didn't want to have to deal with the batteries of a cordless phone and risk spending a lot on one that didn't work. Great phone!"
5,AT&T 201 Phone,This phone is absolutely fabulous. The sound is very clear. It was very easy to program my numbers into the phone. It's black color would coordinate with anyone's desk or counter.
1,A piece of defective junk!,We bought one. It doesn't ring. You won't think AT&T would be embarassed to sell such a piece of junk. You would be wrong.
3,"Nice item, but memory function buggy","This is a cheap and decent phone. It serves the purpose of making and receiving calls, but the 13 number memory system is messed up. The one touch dialing system stopped working within 3 weeks or so which is disappointing. Other than that, the call quality is quite good and coupled with vonage it was much better than standard cellular reception."
1,not a wall phone,"As a desk phone this may be great, but not a wall mount phone. There is nothing to keep the phone from falling off. When it is hung on the wall, the receiver hangs loose and the phone line is open. Or it slides off at the slightest motion. Not a good thing. Not for wall mount."
1,Cannot be hung on a wall as advertised,"I received the phone and went through the processing of installing it. However, even though the description says it can easily be hung on a wall, the handset has no way to rest in or lock onto the base. As a matter of fact, the base is slanted downward so the handset keeps sliding out when hung vertically. This is a desk or tabletop phone only. Since I bought it for my kitchen wall, I am debating going through the effort of sending it back or using it in a room that has a jack but doesn't really need a phone. ??"
3,The phone,"This phone is fine, does the job but I only have two issues with it. One, it is of much lighter weight than the same phones priginaly produced and two the back light buttons are not as well lit."
2,need improvements,"This product was bulky and the sound quality not good, wish it had caller ID window for the call waiting ID. Otherwise perfect for the elderly who don't see well and have frail little hands."
5,Always a wonderful hit!!,"This is the best phone I have ever purchased in so many years. I loved it so much that I bought another as a gift for someone I dearly care about, my sister. I plan to get another sometime soon.I am very satisfied with this telephone!"
3,Cheesy phone,"I thought because it was an AT&T phone that it would be pretty decent. Wrong! It is cheesy. The lights in the dial don't all light up, I'm sure this is because no one buys these any more and they sit for years in some warehouse but still...It feels cheap and light in my hand and the sound quality is sub-par. I bought it to have a land line to use when the power goes out and I guess it will serve that purpose. I know it was inexpensive but I thought that was because nobody buys them any more."
3,"Cute, but not the best support","This swimsuit is very cute and served it's purpose. However, the top did not offer the support you would expect from a maternity top. It was not extremely flattering, but was comfortable."
4,better than the first,the main reason i wanted to see this movie is because diane keaton was in it. she turned out to be very good as the wife of funny man steve martin. even if you don't see the first movie its still good. in the first movie she just gets married. you don't really miss much. if your looking for a good movie with diane keaton you need to watch SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE.
3,Bre's,"This movie really is very funny. Even though you know what is going to happen, it still remains enjoyable. However, this movie is not remarkably unique in any way. Still, it makes for a very entertaining 90 minutes."
5,Classic Hawaiian,Bought this for my wife. Now she can't get it out of my CD player. Classic Hawaiian music. Sitting on your deck out back at night with a tropical drink in hand brings back FLOODS of memories of numerous Hawaiian vacations. This makes me want to go back!!
3,Only for tourists,"Just looking at the titles of the songs on this CD tells you that this is not REAL Hawaiian music. Oh, the music is nice and great for background. But if you're serious about Hawaiian music, Hawaii indigenous culture, both 'historical' and modern, then look elsewhere. There ARE artists who perform REAL Hawaiian music, and sing in Hawaiian. YOu can get 'historical' music, there is an excellent 2-CD set from the U-Hawaii. The Maui Historical Society just across from the Banyon tree in Lahaina carries modern REAL Hawaiian music, the [local store] in Kahulaui also offers great choices. The Bishop Museum in Honolulu has some good CDs too. For modern music, look up Amy Gilliom or the slack key guitar masters, or Keola Beamer... Amazon has them listed."
2,Feel the Mana!,"I don't know... maybe it's just me, but I don't Feel the Mana. Maybe this cd is good for homesick Hawaiians, but if you're looking for a party disk, look elsewhere."
2,A disappointment,I was hoping to receive moist and tasty dates for snacking. These were kind of dried up. I got a refund for them.
3,any other books out there?,In this book the author summarizes the stories of people who struggled with their weight i would say mainly people who are over 300lbs. I have a lot of respect for the people who decided to share their stories in this book. At the same time i was hoping to read more about people who were not over 300lb but still struggled with eating healthy and exercising. Sorry to say but I found the stories very depressing and for some reason i wasn't able to finish the book and i put it away. It is very touching but it was not the type of motivation that i was looking to read. What's amazing is that these people were overweight but managed to fall in love and get married...how insecure could they have been? It proves to me that appearance is not everything because someone had noticed them and overlooked their weight problem and at some point they felt comfortable enough to feel attracted to someone...which for me is very difficult to even think about dating anyone when i am overweight.
5,HOW TO GET TO KNOW CHRIST BETTER,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL AND VERY INEXPENSIVE LITTLE BOOK THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A BLESSING TO ME. THE ARTHUR ANNE GRAHAM LOTZ HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB SHOWING HOW JESUS CAN BRING PEACE , COMFORT AND HOPE INTO A VERY TROUBLED AND TRYING WORLD. THE BOOK INCLUDES SOME INSPIRATIONAL SCRIPTURE THAT HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF CHRIST MORE AND THE HOPE HE OFFERS AND AS AN ADDED BONUS THERE IS A CD THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD AT THE END OF A HARD DAY. AFTER READING THIS BOOK AND THE SCRIPTURES IN HERE I FEEL THIS PUBLICATION SHOWS THAT CHRIST OFFERS PEACE AND HOPE. I WILL BE RECAMENDING THIS BOOK FOR MY BIBLE STUDY AT CHURCH AND I FEEL IT WOULD MAKE A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR A FRIEND , FAMILY MEMBER, OR SOLDIER SERVING OVER SEAS."
4,Very nice.,"I bought one for me and one for a gift. Makes a great gift, because it has a CD in the back along with the book. Thanks, Anne, you did a good job on this!"
2,One little problem,The problem with this is that you cannot open the phone without taking it completely out of the holster.
4,Three Cheers,"This is Gwynne Forster's first mainstream book and if your were a fan of her previous romances you won't feel let down. Ms. Forster does a really clever take off on Shakespeare's King Lear with this story about a newspapers owner and her three daughters. I really enjoyed it and I look forward to the next mainstream novel Ms. Forster writes.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men"
3,Not as Engaging as I Expected.....,"When Twilight Comes is a family saga that follows the Hairston clan as they cope with an immediate family crisis: a fatally ill mother. After failing to heed the call, the two older siblings reveal their ""true colors"" as the family matriarch supports the youngest daughter's acceptance of the family business. We are introduced to shallow characters and watch as they deal with crumbling marriages, self-discovery, and growth. I understand where Forster was going with the novel and I applaud her efforts, but I thought the novel moved rather slowly and the climaxes were fairly light which seemed to prolong the novel to the point of me losing interest in the characters toward the end. This was my first time reading any book by Gwynne Forster. I had heard a great deal about her work and had read many praises. However after reading this novel, I was slightly disappointed because I was expecting more than what was delivered."
4,FAMILY MATTERS,"WHEN TWILIGHT COMES is the story of a strong widowed mother, Marge Hairston, Owner of the Woodmore Times, and her three children, Drogan, Cassandra (Cassie), and Sharon the youngest. Margie is confronted with failing health, and the behavior of her children dealing with the many crisis they're about to face.There were many secondary characters which brought so much to WHEN TWILIGHT COMES, you could possibly think there was a second book in the future with all these wonderful characters stories.I've always been a big fan of Ms. Forster books, enjoyed them all, and WHEN TWILIGHT COMES has proven to be another excellent read."
3,Not bad,"This is the first book I've read by Ms Forster. The book was one of those where you struggle in the beginning and towards the middle-end it finally gets good. Then it's over, leaving you hanging. For the most part I'm glad I read the book. It had some real life situations I could picture actually happening. Some of the situations where rushed and you had no idea what was going on, but went with the flow. I look forward to reading some more of her books."
4,Another Great One from an Exceptional Author,"I've been looking forward to Ms. Forster's first crossover into mainstream fiction and I'm not disappointed. Although, I was slow getting into this story I really enjoyed the way these characters made me think about myself and what I would do in a similar situation. These characters are people you know, maybe even yourself.As always I look forward to future books by Ms. Forster."
2,DVD player stopped working,"I've had one for a few years and the dvd is gradually working less. I get a ""no disk"" messege when I put in a normal dvd and it take at least an hour of trying to get it to work. The tv part still works"
2,Doesn't stay put,"The concept is great but needs to be improved upon. The part that you lay on constantly wrinkles, bunches up, and shifts around b/c there's nothing keeping it laying flat while your bodies are naturally moving on top of it. It gets realy uncomfortable having the material bunch up under you and you need to keep fixing and adjusting it. I'm disappointed since there are very few of these types of items available for bedsharing with our infant. I wish the sheet part was longer so that it could be tucked under the other side of the mattress or something - that way, maybe it would stay put."
2,The author says......,"I say it is an excellent and informative book. Everyone I know who read it told me so. They also said that as they read the book, they felt that I was right there beside them.... it was so real. I regret to say that the book is out of print, that's due to the publisher's decision and no reflection on the quality of the book. If you are interested in the topics of dreams, spontaneious past life memories,and healing karmic relationships, get a hold of a copy. I promise you will enjoy reading it. Love ya."
5,As much a travel account as an architectural,"Majesty Of The Mississippi Delta is as much a travel account as an architectural and art history of the homes, churches, and stores on the Mississippi Delta. Color photos of both interiors and exteriors are accompanied by quotes from historical documents and descriptions of each building. A rich history for those who enjoy architectural history in general and the Mississippi area in particular."
3,Decent but not quite what I thought it to be,"I bought this book to practise my logical reasoning skills with actual logical arguments and fallacies - I'm not interested in US domestic politics. The main problem of the book from this point of view is that Mr. Limbaugh seems to make errors mainly in the form of ad hominem fallacies. And though the book contains many examples of other kinds of logical errors in Limbaugh's writings, some types of common fallacies are missing.The idea of collecting and analyzing political arguments from the point of view of logic is a good one, but for learning logical reasoning the book should be more comprehensive. For that purpose, other political thinkers should be covered, too.For those wanting a good introduction to logical reasoning I recommend Kelley's ""The art of reasoning""."
2,Poor rejection of Rush,"Rush Limbaugh's been proven to be wrong many times. This is not a book that does a good job of it though. The intro in which the laws of logic are explained was pretty interesting but overall it was drab, nitpicky and it even seemed illogical at times. Even Al Franken rejected Dittoism better than this."
1,disappointing,"Was mildly entertaining - can be read in a couple of hours. Does not appear to be a serious attempt at addressing the subject. Rush is prone to invalid arguments. However, this book did not provide sufficient material to address such arguments. It is sufficient to educate novice readers on basic logic."
1,Ad hominen is all they got.,"Under the subtrafuge of a lesson in logic, the author holds up a subjective opinion and purports to poke logic holes into that subjectivity. It is like, i ask you, did your dad love you? You provide an answer. Then I ""prove that your answer is illogical"". I was a lib for 20 years. Guess which side has no logic. Now, if one takes this book as a collection of comedy then i give it 2 stars instead."
2,Cutesy Introduction to Adler,THERE IS NO excuse for so many typo and factual errors in a published book...WRITERS AND READERS PRESS has to do a better job!!!
3,"simple, but not very professional","I found this book to be a very simple adaptation of Adler's counseling theory. It was a brief , general overview of an otherwise complex theory. While reading the book, however, I found it difficult to overlook the obvious errors in spelling and grammer that were prevalent throughout."
3,Pretty good,His message on the caribou herd is 5 star message. It is a shame what may happen to the caribou herd if or when drilling happens. All in all a pretty good book.
5,Narcissism is usually the topical domain of psychology,"But, in this hugely funny and sometimes mean-spirited, book, Tony Hoagland really gives the therapy community something to think about. I was particularly drawn to the poem ""Hate Hotel"" because of its forthright and unsentimental take on the power and passion of hate. I was also intrigued with ""Suicide Song"", which reflected a mature understanding of why, as we grow older, the only responsible choice is ""life.""If you're looking for a book that is funny, wise, and sometimes wicked, this is the book for you."
3,Great expectations from the earlier seasons,"but these episodes just aren't as strong. I only vaguely remember seeing these on Comedy Central, probably because they are aired less than the previous seasons' shows.Laughed more at the Chapelle ""quickie"" sketch included on Disc One than all the episodes combined on said disc.Oh, and no commentaries on this season's DVDs. Again, not so much bad as not as good as their other work, including ""Wigfield.""ADDENDUM--Upon further review and viewing Disc Two, this is a very funny set."
4,waiting for season 3,"i've been wearing out my dvds for the first two seasons. they're very good, and i think the best parts are the bonus dvd features.while i'll buy season 3 as soon as it's out, i have to say it's the weakest of all 3 seasons. i'm not sure why the quality faded, it got too formulaic maybe, or they just ran out of the 'let's make a show' spririt.here's hoping they have some great commentary tracks or something to boost the shows"
4,What are you looking at???,"One of the funniest shows to ever hit cable. This is by far the most creative, politically incorrect and wonderfully funny shows I have ever seen.The humor is very sharp and not always obvious...which I love.The best part of these DVD's is the Outtakes. As you can probably guess from a show like this, they had plenty of mishaps and hilarious moments. The outtakes are pretty long so there is plenty to watch. Every actor in the show compliments the other very well and believe me when I say that you will love, love, love this. Oh, and by the way...""Good times""."
5,I wish they had done more seasons.,What a funny show. I bought this one to round out my Strangers With Candy collection. Stephen Colbert is awesome at being a total (boy with no Dad). Good times!
1,Not even B quality,Toss up what was worse: the acting or the cinematography or the typecasting. 1 star was more than its worth.
1,Sucks!,"Probably the worst movie I've ever dared to sit through. I rented it! I can't believe anyone would pay to own it. Wait for the tv release, one of those 1 or 2 am flicks. But, be very drunk before you watch it!"
1,The filmmaker is entering bogus 5-star reviews!!!,"I think the three 5 star reviews of this film may have all been done by the same person, possibly the filmmaker: these 3 reviewers(Roger Steinberg, Chrsi Stevens, and Jeffrey Baker) have a total of 5 reviews between them....of Tino Struckman's 'Normandy' and this."
1,Ugh,"I almost never ever stop a movie in the middle and don't finish it. It was THAT bad. The beginning - I was trying to give it a chance; it just had more of a choppy low budget indy film, which I can handle. I think the acting/writing/editing actually gets worse as it goes on. Considering it started as choppy and low budget, you can use your imagination how something could get worse than that..... Glad I only spent the $1 to rent from the redbox."
4,Outstanding Value,"Excellent, big sound at a very reasonable price.....Might be one of the best values around. Integrates really well with my TV/VCR/DVD setup. But the surround sound speakers are a little disappointing: too much treble, and they don't add much unless my ears happen to be very close by."
5,His Best Studio Album,"This record has a live feel to it, and it is full of great songs that don't seem to get old. According to legend, Jerry Jeff went down to Austin in the very early seventies to check out the scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters and fell in love with the Austin music scene and the Hill Country. He joined and became the the central figure in the now legendary music that came out of Austin in the early and mid seventies. He also put out a couple of fine records before joining the Austin scene:""Drifting Way of Life"" and ""Bein' Free"". Highly recommended if you like Jerry Jeff and don't already have them. BTW: Michael Murphey's ""Geronimo's Cadillac"" and ""Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir"" are finally available on CD as an Australian import here on Amazon."
5,Amazing Album,"I won't repeat all that has been said here by others, but I have to tell you this is one of the best albums I have ever bought. Night Riders Lament, Jaded Lover, Coat From the Cold, Mississippi You're On My Mind, I Love You... They are all great. Night Riders Lament is one of my all-time favorite songs and, with a little beer buzz, still brings a tear to my eye. Way back in high school I bought this album for the song ""Pissin in the Wind"", which my buddies and I all thought was funny. But that song is my least favorite because of the quality of the rest of the album.I highly recommend this album to those who appreciate quality heart-felt music."
5,excellent variety of music,"uptempo, quiet, funny, attitude, thoughtful. Excellent to listen to alone. Cowboys songs for all cultures and moods."
5,a battle-worn job seeker,"Only after spending almost 1.5 years of fruitless job searching am I truly able to appreciate the advice in this book. The #1 lesson: use the telephone! Use it for almost everything, from company research to actually finding the job opening. Finding jobs is like those slide puzzles with tiles -- when one tile moves, a spot becomes available. The goal is to find that vacant spot before it gets filled. The only way to do this is to monitor each person who you are most like in every company you are interested in and find out when that person jumps ship. That's when you need to make your move. This book will teach you how to do this.I haven't found a job yet, but I'm now inspired with wisdom!"
5,A gentle read for all those who teach writing.,I love this author and I love this book!!! Ralph Fletcher has a way of nudging us as teachers while completely understanding how difficult it is to teach writing! This is a gentle read that uplifts and inspires while it informs.
5,Easy-to-Read Wonder,This easy-to-read wonder was required reading in my graduate class. Everyone in the class loved the book and found it extremely useful.
5,Shania Twain,"If it were up to me, I would say that anything Shania is in, (movies, concerts, music videos) are damn good, but this was the best!! I being a girl, saying that she is hot would be wrong, but she is sure damn foxy. I have all of Shania's CD's including her 1st one with all of the first songs she did. My goal is to be the next Shania ""Twin"".Deb-"
5,Shania Twain you are fantastic,"My daughter Stephanie(aged 10) has to do a school project on a country music singer, yes you guessed it she picked Shania! I think she has great taste. We were amazed at all the information we were able to find on this site, we are thrilled and I`m sure Stephanie we be able to put together a very interesting project. Thanks to all concerned. PS we loved the video"
1,sex sells...doesn't it?,"This no talent woman gives her sad story to the world, who cares!!!! There are more famous stars out that have had worse off scenarios than this chick (ie Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, SRV, do I need to go on). Why do people give into the media hype and buy this trash. Lets put a documentary on the TV and see if we can push a few more albums out the door. She can't sing, write, or perform without the help of her famous husband. Don't buy this trash!!!"
4,A very good book for beginners,"This is my very first jello shot recipe book. I wish there could had been more recipes, but the recipes were very creative and not strictly totally jello recipes. And there were some hotties! My favorite is Cosmo and ISO Ms. Right! But I cannot wait to try the Aurora Borealis (I live in Alaska!) with gold glitter in a duo-tone/duo-flavor base!I really love cook books with very interesting history or comments with the recipes. I think this book even goes beyond my expectations. Very entertaining in a very good way. I highly recommend this book to others that are curious. Made for one hell of a bachelorette party I catered, I guarantee you!!"
5,Amazing Deal!,"I purchased two of these foundations for approx. $8 which is more savings than 2 for 1. This product is discontinued and has been replaced by another cream foundation w/ a pump but I actually prefer this one. It goes on smoothly w/ buildable coverage without streaking, smearing or looking wet. The finish is a dewy/matte combination&looks great on my friends w/ oily skin as well as dry. I definitely recommend this product."
2,great music....??,"bought this disc on the recommendations of fellow listeners on Amazon....came away unimpressed; in fact, puzzled as to why anyone would think this a great record. save for a couple of songs, you can't hear the crowd, Jerry Jeff's ""voice"" is average at best, and the general songwriting/lineup for this album is mundane. I'm sure this guy has talent and would welcome any tips on other records from this artist but this one??? no thank you."
5,jerry jeff walker,think of austin texas in the 70's...cool longneck beer and tubing down the comal river...this album was popular than and now..classics such as up against the wall redneck mother are still fun...a must for third coast music lovers
5,I feel drunk just listening to this...,"JJF has mostly wasted his talent, but this collection of songs shows what he was capable of at one time."
2,Sadly disappointing; self absorbed,"These are world class authors, each impressive, so this book held great promise. What a disappointment. I'm actually saddened to have read it because I've lost some respect for each of them. What could motivate this group of people to write in such an ego-centric, ill-disciplined and poorly referenced way? I can only imagine it was the clash of egos that allowed this book to sink to its lowest common denominator so often.Yes, as other reviewers have said, there are nuggets here. The topic itself is profoundly important. So all the sadder that the message has been diluted, or perhaps polluted, in its delivery. Can do better..."
1,Business mumbo jumbo,I really would not recommend this book. It is business mumbo jumbo at its very worst. The whole thing seems to be just a conversation between the 4 authors and it is written in a language that only they can understand. I have been involved in organisational change and I can tell you that this book would not have helped at all. Mind you if you want a load of platitudes to make you feel comfortable I guess it might help.I am only giving it one star because the no star option is not available
2,Presence?,"I had read individual books by these authors and I was hoping for a cumulative effect. I was a bit let down. I expected the insights to be a bit deeper and profound, something along the lines of- ""Synchronicity: The Inner Path of Leadership by Joseph Jaworski, Betty Sue Flowers, and Peter M Senge"" or ""Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World by Margaret J Wheatley"""
4,Deep work happening in some organizations,"Although I agree with some of the previous reviewers that much of the material in this book could be found in more depth elsewhere, yet I still enjoyed the book. What I found interesting was the process the authors went through in trying to clarify the core ideas in the context of their work with organizations and organizational leaders. It is important that these ideas, whether original or not, permeate some of our core cultural organizations. It is these organizations which have such a large impact on the world today and it is the actions of these organizations (and our contribution to the social matrix which makes such actions possible) which critically influence our well being. It is heartening to see that the viewpoints expressed in this book may have a chance of taking hold in such organizations and seem to have already begun to germinate among some of the leaders of these organizations."
3,"Presence: An Exploration of Profound Change in People, Organizations, and Society",I did not find this to be a very useful book for my MBA studies.
4,Valuable Read with Many Rehashed Ideas,"If this is one of your first forrays into the field of human potential and the application of systems theory to the field of soical science, then this book will have a lot to offer. Its expansive treatment of topics was tiresome and repetitive at times especially if you are well read in the field. However, the book provides essential grounding on how many of the difficult social issues facing us today can be approached in a meaningful way. All in all there is more from this book to learn than discard."
2,Like looking for a needle in a haystack,"As a student of change and a leader who has done it in large organizations for fifteen years I really hoped when I bought this book that there was something profound perhaps, or at least new in these very learned peoples approach to change. The corporations I have worked in wouldnt get this book at all. There are some good nuggets occasionally but boy do you have to bear with it to find them. Another observation is that they seem to be out to solve world hunger so to speak. They dance around Taoism and Buddhism and never mention Christianity to any degree and that is what they are preaching if you ask me. To me this is another example of how leaders in America today are so disconnected they have no idea what is happening on the street ... does New Orleans ring a bell. Hello?"
5,"Yes, Better than Airport","The previous reviewer is absolutely right. This card is faster, cheaper and easier to use than the Airport cards. In fact this is what Apple is now selling to its customers since the original Airport 802.11b card is no longer available. (Of course, in typical Apple fashion, they are selling it for three times as much as everyone else!)An added bonus of this card is the fact that it also works on PC's as well. Great card!"
1,didn't work,This product did not work for me. I had several computer tech people work with me to try to figure out what the problem was. Other similar products by different manufacturers worked fine with my laptop.
1,A dancer from Tha Town,"i wish i had read these reviews when i bought this hunk of junk in January of 2002. as i sit here typing this, i'm listening to brian mcknight out of only one speaker. when it changes cds, it sounds like a squirrel in a blender. because of the poor sound quality EVERYTHING sounds like a roger & zapp tape from '84. don't do it people, for the love of all things good and holy!"
1,straight arrow,There is a hiss to things recorded with the cassette recorder. The radio stopped working less than a month after we bought it.
1,(...),"(...) This is the most cheapest product I ever bought, It is so cheap it broke a week after i bought it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Very good game what happend with MVP 2006 or 2007?,"I think is a very good game, needs to work with the graphics. I can not wait to see MVP 2007 with improvements."
2,Not a very good game.,"There is exellent graphics, and the seasons and ""Make your own ballpark"" is awesome, but the controls are impossible to master. I suggest doing a season, and managing/simming the games."
2,Getting worse??,"I love MLB 2004 so I bought 2005 but when I recieved it I was extremely dissapointed with the graphics, I think they are worse than the 2004 version."
3,Parent wishes they made a G-rated kid version,"My 9 year old son LOVES to play this game. I just wish they made an almost identical G-rated version for children - All the same game play, but without songs that BLARE out lyrics like ""brown girl, you're lookin' like somethin' I want"". Girls, brown or otherwise, are not 'things' to 'want.' NOT the best message for boys, or girls for that matter. What were they thinking when they chose some of these songs?? FORTUNATELY, the game lets you turn the music off. My 9 year old gladly did just that."
2,Didnt enjoy it at all.,"I've been playing MVP Baseball 2003 for for the past six months straight, completely addicted.I played 2005 for an hour and I hate it.Compared to 2003 it seems like a massive step down. The models were a little more detailed but the stadiums were annoying, the graphics were inadequate and the ball doesnt smoothly move in motion. My computers in very good shape so its not the cpu's fault.I understand theres more features and things to do, but I am very disappointed in this game and I'd advise anyone to find something better, especially if they're moving from mvp 2003."
4,HP LaserJet Q6470A black print cartridge,"I got my cartridge on time but the cartridge box was bend, I won't be using it for sometime but, I assume it will be fine.What is there to say about print cartridges? When the old one wears out, you put in a new one.I have used this company before and their service and pricing has been excellent."
4,Worthy posthumous addition to RZ's legacy,"Roger Zelazny wrote some of the finest fiction I've ever had the pleasue to read. Although this collection of shorts does not match the quality of his other anthologies, there are still plenty of stories that ensnare the mind and entice the imagination. The Amber shorts at the end of the book made me want to reread the entire series for the umpteenth time. A gifted writer who was taken all too soon, Roger Zelazny truly has channelled some Manna from Heaven in this compendium."
3,Worth it for the Amber stories alone ...,"Like most Zelazny fans, I was very pleased to find a ""new"" collection of Zelazny stories available for purchase. The ""post-_Chronicles_ Amber shorts are both difficult and expensive to find individually. Had I known _Manna.._ was coming out, I could have saved about $ 30.The ""non-Amber"" stories in the book, IMHO, varied greatly in quality. I can certainly understand why some of them have been reprinted so infrequently. On the other hand, some Zelazny is better than no Zelazny, so I would still recommend purchasing this collection.Ron BlissRon Bliss"
3,Hard to give a rating,"In my mind I seperate this book into two sections.The 6 Amber stories at the end of the book, I rate five stars. Any fan of the the first AND second Amber series will want to know what Zelazny had in mind following the last book of the second series. You can see his plans to possibly write a third series and where it would have headed.The other stories, I rate two stars. I enjoyed the first two stories ""Godson"" and ""Manna From Heaven"", but after that I found the most of remaining stories very weak and unenjoyable. But your milage may vary."
4,At least give it a scan at your local library...,"I perused this at my local health food store. If you already eat outside of the typical American diet and aren't opposed to meat/and dairy alternatives, you will find that you won't have to change much. I agree that I am slightly puzzled by a couple of the foods I must avoid, but most of it makes sense...NOT that I am happy about giving up corn and potatos! My parents are both O types,as well and my father and all his relatives have diabetes. Staying away from the wheat will keep me from that pathway, I hope. Do go to your library first and judge for yourself."
1,Definately Not What I Was Looking For,"If you want to be starved out of your pregnancy by all means read this book. However, I do not agree with the premise of the book. It's fine that certain blood types react to certain things differently but when someone tries to tell me that because I have AB blood, I shouldn't eat anything that's not recommended for both A and B bloodtypes but also that there were severe restrictions on many other things that I shouldn't eat as well. I tried looking in the book for things that I could actually consume without feeling horrible about it, but I didn't find much. Take my advise, if your doctor gives you an idea of what to consume, take it. If not, eat healthy and your baby will be fine."
1,Save your money or spend it elsewhere,"I pre-read this in the library before I bought it. Good thing! It is obviously another gimmick to make this guy (and his publisher) rich. His ""science"" says that because of my blood type, as a nursing mother, I should only consider moderate exercise like walking or swimming. But other blood types can go mountain climbing or perform martial arts. And, as other reviewer notes, no meat. Get real. This book is hype, paranoia, and fantasyland all rolled into one neat package.Listen up ladies: Some guy's trying to make a buck from you by instilling fear in you that you are not doing something right if you don't follow his plan. Phooey! You'll do far better to simply ""listen"" to your own body, your own brain, and reading a wide variety of literature on pregnancy and breastfeeding; you'll have a better plan and a better sense of your own personal best diet, whether nursing or not. To heck with him and his weird science!"
1,Contradicts what my nutritionist and doctor advises,"The concept of the book is interesting which got me reading in the first place. Although as I hit page 100, I just could not continue. I was to avoid all cheeses that are mostly considered safe for me and baby and that it was OK for me to eat some harmful (unpasteurized) ones. I feel sorry for the pregnant woman and her fetus who follows this ridiculous diet plan and ends up with listeria. There are also some ""no no"" fish that are listed on the OK list also. But I was absolutely floored when it told me to avoid all meat.. (protein is essential!) This is a crucial time for optimal health so please, just eat healthy and see a doctor or nutritionist who actually knows what they are talking about."
1,Bad Choice for a CD Changer!,"I've owned this CD changer for about 1 1/2 years. Worked OK for about 8-10 months but now skips on just about every CD. When it changes to a new CD, the changer makes noises like the CD is not seated and spinning correctly. It then skips and nothing will remedy it except repeatedly removing and restarting the CD or a good ""bump"" on the side. The case is cheaply made and obviously the internal components are the same. There are much better choices out there for very little more money!"
2,doesn't like CD-Rs,"I've had this model for several months and it works fine with commercially pressed CDs. However, it makes strange noises when it plays my home-burned CD-Rs. If you burn your own CD-Rs you may want to think twice before buying this model."
1,Don't Buy This!,What a terrible product. After only 4 months of use it is no longer working. Don't waste your time or your money with this product. MOVE ON
3,A fair value,"I have owned this model for over 2 years. Easy to use panel controls and remote. Mine still operates, but sometimes skips now, even after a good cleaning. For the price (same as 2 years ago) it was a good value. Now, better quality CD players [do not cost as much], while the RCA did not come down comparitively in price. I would have to recommend a low priced Sony or Technics for [just a little more]."
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this to replace my old Sony that finally gave out. It was the only 5-disc player available in Circuit City and,for the price, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Boy was I wrong! The main problem is that wouldn't or couldn't read or play many of the cd's that I had burned myself (and which played just fine on my old Sony). Also, I found some of the features (random shuffle, programming) were not really user friendly. Since it is too late for me to return it, I'm junking it and buying another Sony from Amazon. I bought the SCD-CE595 (for about $20 more than the RCA), which arrived today and immediately played the cd's that the RCA would not play."
2,Not worth the money,"We purchased this CD player less that 10 months ago. It worked great until last month, when it stopped changing CD discs. Recently, it just began to lock up and not play at all."
1,RCA - Worst Customer Service Possible,"I purchased the RP8070 in August 2003. I had trouble with the unit and sent it back March 2004. I paid $80. The current retail is $50. They said they cannot fix mine and no longer make them so cannot replace it and have nothing comparable. Six months later they are still for sale everywhere and Amazon.com advertises that more are coming in soon. I guess they do not know they are no longer being made. All I asked for was replace it or give me what I paid. They refuse unless I fax them a receipt. Problem is the receipt is partially illegible and not faxable. Anyway, it is one big ripoff and I would advise anyone away from doing business with these people."
3,Backordered for xmas,"I ordered this on Dec. 20 2009, and received an email from the company saying it was backordered, even though it says ""In Stock"" on Amazon's website!"
3,Wildflowers is a good book,"This book was good for those interested in different wildflowers. The text was somewhat small, but the pictures were very nice."
5,Great information.,"A great book about some common and uncommon plants you have admired, but didn't know the names."
1,awful!,"this are the worst things i've purchased in awhile. they are huge, fall off my feet, and don't even get very warm! even if they got warm enough, they fall off my feet, so they don't keep them warm. it's not even like you can even put socks OVER them - they're so big, i think bigfoot could wear them."
3,Can't walk in these,"Should you have to make a ""trip"" Also, since they leave dampness, when they cool off, they actually feel cold. Smell nice though."
2,Size does NOT fit all,"The package says one size fits all...? I don't think so. These fit probably about perfect for a women's 7 1/2. If your feet are smaller, they will be lose and bigger, they won't fit at all. They warm nicely (but only on the bottom) and smell great but the beads or rice or whatever is in there makes it uncomfortable to walk around. Plan to stay in bed or on the couch when wearing them."
2,Not too helpful,My husband has trouble with cold feet and making his own heat. But this didn't help much. A pair of sherling slippers finally seems to do the trick.
2,"Horrible Sizing, Continually Falls Off Feet",These warm up great but wont stay on your feet as the sizing is horrible. There is no tightening strap around the ankles or anything to keep them on better. Id keep searching for a different product that works a bit better
2,stinks!,They do warm your feet but they are bulky and in my opinion very smelly. And not in a good way...the blend of herbs just isn't very appealing at all.
1,WAY too big,"These booties say one size fits all on the package. Well, they might fit Andre the Giant, but on me they were way too big. (I have size eight feet.) If you have big feet and really, really thick ankles these might fit. Other wise skip these and look at other products that are smaller, offer different sizes based on your shoe size, or have elastic or soemthing to keep them on. These things are just too darn big!"
1,Only heat the bottoms,"I always use my regular bed buddy for my aches and pains. Probably am on number 3 by now because I use them so often. I thought these booties would be perfect for my cold feet. NO !! I did not understand that the heat packs were separate and only slid into the outside bottom. The rest of my foot was out of luck. Silly me, I thought you put the entire footie in the microwave so the whole foot would be warm. There is no way to walk in them either so they are not that great after all. They also need a lace or something to tie around the ankle to keep them on. I was sooooooo very, very anxious for these to come and now I am sooooooo disappointed. And why does everything today have to be 'scented'??"
2,Unhappy with product,"If there had been a full description of the product I would not have purchased it.They did NOT say that you put warmed up ""bean bags"" in a pouch under the sole so you can NOT walk in these! They also did not say that the warmth only lasts approx an hour!"
1,A good idea that never got off the drawing board,"While some reviewers say the socks are too big, I, a male taking size 81/2, could not get my feet fully into them. A zipper or elastic ankle collar are two solutions. The fragrant insert has stitching partially across the cloth container, presumably to allow even distribution from end to end. However, by the time I had struggled to get the socks on, the filler had redistributed unevenly.All in all, a good idea but a terrible product."
3,A-OK.,"These foot warmers get my feet nice & toasty, plus I appreciate the unique cinnamony smell. However, if I had to buy foot warmers again, I would probably go for the kind that plug in to the wall, since these cool off after about 15 minutes, and then its back to the microwave. You can't walk around in these at any rate, so they may as well be plugged in to the wall."
2,Warm for a while but HUGE!!,"To be honest these are pretty nice, they heat within 1 minute in microwave and the eucalyptus smells great, and for about 45- 1hr minutes your feet will be nicely warmed and comforted..BUT!!! I give them two stars because they are simply ENORMOUS! you cannot walk in them because the heat pad is full of beans - crunchy to stand on and probably damaging the product if you do. But also they are so ridiculously huge that if you lift your feet they fall off. All you can do is heat them, sit down, put them on and stay put..If you want to warm you feet while reading a book on meditation or self help, then perhaps these are for you, but if you just want warm feet and want to get on with your day then get something else.."
1,a waste of money,These booties are not comfortable and does NOT retain heat for any longer than 2 minutes. Get some warm socks instead
1,not impressed,Item does not fit properly and the insert is hard to take out and put back in. I would not recommend this item to be purchased by anyone else.
3,Warm and comfortable but forget about walking in them,"I bought these for my wife who always has cold feet. They do a good job of warming her feet bit they are next to impossible to walk around in. Strictly for use while sitting or laying down. The heating pouch is in the ""sole"" so according to my wife, walking in them is like trying to walk on half-filled water balloons."
2,Bed Buddy Warming Footies,"I wouldn't recommend these booties. It takes longer to warm them in the microwave than stated in the instructions. Once on your feet, you cannot walk around as they are lumpy and hurt your feet. Plus they won't stay on your feet unless you are sitting/reclining. I like that you can wash the outer bootie. However, they don't snuggle up on your feet very well. The insert you warm up is heavy and lumpy, so they sag toward the back under your heel. You have to sit down or lay down, then find a way to secure them to your feet so they stay in place. Perhaps if velcro had been applied as a way to secure the booties around your foot, they would have stayed in place. I quit using them after several tries. Get something different."
4,Warming Slippers,"This is a good idea, but these slippers are not designed for walking. If you are setting and watching TV they will keep your feet really warm, however, if you have to get up for something, you need to take them off. Seems like they should fit better or have laces or something."
2,warm,they do make the bottoms of your feet warm doesnt do good for the tops and and toes well and you cant walk in them cause they are heavy from the beans or whatever that is in them.
2,Ok but too big and can't move around in them,Slipper are one size and way too big for me. So they move around to much to walk in at all. They do heat in 2 min and stay warm for about 30 minutes so ok if your just sitting.
2,These slippers had beanbag-like soles in the bottom.,"The slippers are well-made, with an open slot on the bottom from which to remove beanbag-like pouches to heat in the microwave.However, my husband found it difficult to walk in them, so I contacted Tempur-Pedic [...], who cannot sell, but graciously gave me, 4 returned foam samples to insert into the bottom of the slippers; now my husband can walk comfortably. (We already own a Tempurpedic mattress, which my husband loves).I strongly suggest Carex's product development manager contact TempurPedic's product development manager in order to encourage TempurPedic to manufacture soles for these slippers. Millions of people would purchase them for under $20.00 and more jobs would be created in Lexington, KY where TempurPedic is located.Thank you."
3,Okayish Slippers,"The inserts heat up wonderfully and stay warm for up to 1.5 hours. But, the slippes are one-size fits all. I wear size 9 shoe, but these still slip of my feet. They dont stay up like they show you in the picture. They are a fleece material, and you cannot walk with these. I just wish they fit on my feet tighter so that I can feel the heat better. Would not really reccomend b/c they are too loose."
2,Not what I expected,"The boots appear in the photo to provide warmth to the entire foot; however, they only have a pad on the bottom that warms up. Other than that they are just socks. The top of the foot remains cold. Also, they cannot be worn while standing/walking. I guess i should have known that ""bed buddies"" meant to be only worn when in bed. They do warm the bottom of the foot though."
2,Too Big & Can't Walk with them on,I bought these for my girlfriend & they were too big & she couldn't walk around the house in them & they didn't heat up well or for very long. I had to return them.
1,so uncomfortable,"waste of money, it fills like you have a bag of gravel tied to your foot albeit loosely since there is no size or shape to this product"
3,worked great for awhile!,The only complaint I have is a seam on one of the pouches came undone and the insides spilled out on the floor and ottoman
4,There toasty,These slippers are pretty neat. They do keep your feet warm for a bit. They need to be reheated after a while. One thing is you are not able to walk with them on due to the heating sac on the bottom. If you get up and forget that you can not walk well with these on then you look kinda silly because you look like you forgot how to walk. They serve the purpose of keeping your feet warm even after the sac cools off.
1,Poor design,"These don't work for me at all. The fleece booty is very thin, so offers less warmth then a simple sock. The material that heats up in the microwave is just a bag that sits in the sole of the booty, so there is only warmth from the bottom. Since it is too bulky to walk in, you obviously need to wear them while lying down, which invariably means the heat sags away from your feet. The only way they warmed my icy feet is to have my feet tightly wrapped in blankets to hold the heat in... but a simple heating pad or a sinus pack that warms in the microwave has just as much effectiveness. So, ultimately, I was very disappointed. I hoped they would be an option to warm my feet while watching TV, but my feet actually got colder without any protection on the top of my feet. Pretty disappointing."
3,Good but not perfect...,"I bought these to wear when I sit at my desk and my feet get cold. However, I found that they are really only suited for bedtime. They are constructed in such a way that they are really hard to slip on and get over the ankles--and I don't suffer from swollen joints. Another consideration is that the ""bean"" sacks--the part of the warmers that actually heat up in the nuke--are slipped into the *bottom* of the warmers, so you *cannot* walk on them. The directions say to remove the bean sacks to heat up in the nuke, then slip them back into the warmers. I did that the first time, but it's inconvenient, so now I just put the whole thing in--no problem so far.In summation, these are a great idea and do warm the feet nicely, but the design is flawed, which creates inconvenience and limits their use to bedtime."
2,Makes your feet damp and smelly.,"The title says it all. Yes it warms your feet, but only the bottoms. You really can't walk around in them. It doesn't have a very appealing aroma, not a bad smell but why does it need to smell at all? And finally, they keep your feet warm for about 20 minutes and when you take them off, your feet are very damp and clammy."
4,Warm and cozy,I bought these booties because I have Raynaud's Phenomenon and they keep my feet warm and pain free! It takes about a minute to a minute and a half to get them warm enough in the microwave and they stay warm for about an hour. I would recommend these to anyone with circulation problems or diseases.
2,"Poor coverage, loose fit","As others have mentioned, the fit of the booties as a whole is loose and they will easily come off of your foot, especially if you are trying to use them in bed. What really surprised me is that the beanies are only in the bottom! I thought the beanies would be distributed throughout the booties. Thus, the only part of your foot that gets warm is the bottom. And even there, the distribution is not good. I have women's size 9 feet, and even if I tamp down the beanies they do not cover all the way from my heel to my toes.A better design would be: distribute the beanies throughout, allowing the entire thing to be microwaved; make a tighter fit on the ankle; and a longer sole for those with non-small feet. If the beanies were distributed throughout we'd also be able to walk in the things and they wouldn't weigh down and stretch the fabric as much other times.This was just really poorly thought out. I barely give it 2 stars."
3,ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL,"IF YOU WEAR ANYTHING LARGER THAN A SIZE 10 SHOE, FORGET IT.YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR FOOT INSIDE. THIS ITEM WORKS VERY WELL-FOR MY WIFE- SHE WEARS A SIZE 9.MY FEET HOWEVER STILL REMAIN QUITE COLD.TO BAD THEY DON'T COME IN A LARGER SIZE LIKE MY SIZE 12."
1,to heavy!,"These booties were to big, to heavy and didn't stay warm very long.You can't walk in them and laying down with them is uncomfortable because the bean bag slides down.I returned them. Not happy at all."
2,Good idea... useful application poor.,"These ""footies"" sound good. And, description is probably true. The warming wadding in the bottom bunches up in a ball, making waking impossible. VERY problematic for this senior who is a little wobbly anyway. Heated, they feel warm-damp. Just doesn't work for me."
3,too lumpy and uncomfortable,"They are only one size, so, if you have small feet, they will slip off in bed. You can not walk in them as they are too lumpy and uncomfortable and are not made to be a walking slipper."
1,THESE ARE RATHER DUMB,"I wanted to find something for my man's always cold feet. I ordered these and what a joke. First of all, one size does not fit most. He wears a size 12 and we could barely get these on. Next, they are filled with what felt like rice and it would not stay spread out evenly under his foot so the warmth was here-and-there. The final thing is that you cannot walk around in these at all...you have to remove them."
2,not as expected,Material is very thin. insert stink. too over welling the scent inserts are in a plastic bag in garage. foot booties shrunk a whole lot may return can't use. not worth the money.
5,Truly amazing,"Bed Buddies are great, love them in a minute and a half in the microwave and I have warm feet for at least 2 hours. Best money I've spent."
1,bad product,do not buy this product its not good like it described... it just west of money.it does not do what it suppose to do. i think regular socks is better than this.
3,They're scented,"The slippers are well-made, but I didn't know they were scented. I bought them as a gift for a man, and he hated the scent. He also said they don't hold heat for very long. Great idea, though."
2,No so much a Buddy,"They are stinky! The stuff they come with will smell the whole room. The fit very loose, and they didn;t really work for me at all. After a few weeks of use, they were donated."
4,nice,Only con is can't really walk around house in them. Otherwise... Nice decent product. Makes my lady happy happy happy.
3,My gosh they STINK!,"""Fragranced with clove, cinnamon, and eucalyptus"" - smells more like apple, cinnamon, and butter? Very odd smell when you cook these up but I will say, that besides the smell, they are nice. You cannot walk with them on, but if you just want to warm up while laying in bed or sitting at your couch, they work! I am constantly cold and any product that warms me up is a good choice. I just wish these were not scented."
1,Don't bother,"Several things:1. Shoddy workmanship. They look thick, but they aren't. The minute I (carefully) put them on the first time I could hear seams tearing. The fabric is much thinner than it appears in the photo.2. They don't get warm enough. The instructions say to microwave them 30 seconds. I did so. Not warm. The instructions said you can heat for another 30 seconds but never more than 1 minute total. They were not warm.So, inasmuch as they don't heat well and aren't made to last, I'm returning them."
4,very nice,These work well to keep my feet toasty warm when I'm sitting at my desk. I wish there were more sizing options.
3,Mediocre.....,THE GOOD: They work as intended.THE BAD: It's rather corny to heat them up in the microwave. Black would have been a better color.OVERALL: they're ok - nothing special. I think it would be easier to just throw a pair of socks into the dryer.
1,Heated rice padded feet?,"As soon as I opened this I put it back in the box. It has these heavy pads inside, which I think are rice or beans, or something similar, that you put in the microwave.The heat only lasts for less than an hour!"
3,"Hokey, but great message!","Although the movie can be considered ""back in the day"", the message still comes through that its not how important a job you have for the Lord, its how important you consider the job the Lord has given you! You can be just as successful a Christian as a car mechanic as you could a talk show host...and this is the message of part 1, Super Christian.Part 2, Super Christian 2 talks about the masks we put on in front of others as opposed to being who we really are. Superficiality is a big one...piosness is another. Also has a great message!"
4,Works Fine,I used these for my electric fence extension. I nailed them right into my wooden posts and ran the hot wire through these easily. Nice cheap items that work for the purpose they were designed for.
4,"Great premise, interesting presentation","While a weak ending hurts somewhat the overall impression one might get from this book, it's still a thought-provoking (and brief!) read.After awakening from a coma, Martin Harris discovers that he has been ""replaced"" by someone else with his name, and that nobody from his former life recognizes or acknowledges him. Martin spends the novel doing 2 things - trying to prove to others who he really is, and questioning his own existence.While he may not be breaking any new ground, Van Cauweleart definitely makes the reader think about the value and meaning of memories and self-awareness. A great book, one that would likely be worthy of 5 stars if not for the poor finish."
3,done before?,"Sounds the like the book The Man With My Face, which was also made into a film, in which a man comes home to find his wife with a man who looks just like him."
1,Think twice,"This system looks great; moreover, it sounds great, unfortunately the quality is far from great. I had this out of the box and hooked up within minutes, I placed five CDs in the carousel and hit the shuffle button. After about two minutes, the player got hung up and it failed to recognize two of the discs. I returned this machine the next day. Also, when you change CDs or open the carousel, it sounds like an explosion; it's loud I tell ya.I seriously wanted to like this player. Most of the shelf systems today are so ascetically hideous. This one, on the contrary, is designed for the eye; unfortunately it is not designed for the ears. Again think twice before purchasing this product."
4,Good for starters,"I had to buy this book in secret c_c because my parents don't allow it... I found it to be very well written, and the instructions for each working were exact. I haven't bought any other related books yet, but I will... that is, if they're written by the same author as this one."
2,I wouldnt recommend this book to a beginner.,"This book does have a nicely written style i might admit. As in not to cocky or high, I will say that the imformation which is usually correct is not laid out in a very good manner for a beginner. Not only that but some of the practices are not very well detailed and could be intrepreted wrong by the novice. If someone who has read more on the subject first were to read this book. He or she would find it intresting and be better able to discern fact from opinion. All in all this book takes up space on my shelf, although it does have some intresting points of view."
5,Hubby Loves,Was a gift for my husband. He just loved it. He is truck driver and this case protects his new laptop.
1,"Thumbs Down (Low Headset Volume, No Mute,Other Shortcomings)","I really wanted to like this phone, but here are the problems:1. When a headset is plugged in, the volume (for listening) is too low and can't be turned up sufficiently. (This is not a problem with the headset.)2. No mute button. Terrible if you use the phone for work/meetings.3. Limited speed dial. I like to program access codes (like mailbox number and password), since I use my phone for work purposes. I can't do that with this phone.4. The buttons are not very responsive and there is a delay until you hear a ""beep"" indicating that you pressed a button. Sounds petty but the result is that, when dialing, you often miss a number but don't realize it until it's too late. Then you have to start over.5. The size and shape of the phone are not conducive to holding it between your head/ear and shoulder."
3,"Good overall, but one key problem.","I just discovered in another review here that there truly is no mute function. I had been searching the Web for advice on how to do just that. With small children and regular concalls, I need to be able to mute. Ack.I am happy with this phone otherwise."
4,A Great Read,"It's unfortunate that this book was offered to people in classrooms with apparently little background info. This is a rich and densely-packed text that requires a huge amount of knowledge about indian affairs (from canada southward), literature, theory, and, well, the book itself is a bibliography of important texts on issues.Vizenor does a brilliant job of questioning the objectivity of notions such as 'history' and 'race' in a tremendously humerous way, yet keeping enough historical truth that it's difficult to know what this trickster author is making up and what historians have made up (by concensus, of course). It's not something that can be read as an isolated text and understood or enjoyed fully. Crap, I know that I don't 'fully' understand it, but I have enough history and native american literature under my belt to at least nod knowingly a few times.It's his explorations of race, sovereignty, tribal status, and tricksters that really made this book a treat for me..."
5,Solid Beginner's Book,"Clear and concise instruction on how to learn the game. The exercises at the end of the chapter's are a must for someone whois serious to start taking on opponents.Buy, Read and enjoy it, but most of all learn the basics of thiswonderful game."
3,"It is adequate, it could be better","It is not bad. But it should take a couple of extra steps to be good. You do not have to state the obvious, unless you intend to step on it to go even further. Which does not happen to a satisfactory degree."
4,Chess Instructions,"This book was purchased for my 13 year old granddaughter to learn more about chess which hergrandfather had been teaching her. She is a good student and immediately began reading it.I believe that she found it easy to understand and will gain knowledge on the fundamentalsof the game. Also, game plays and openings. I was pleased with the product."
5,Learn Chess by John Nunn,"It may start slow due it giving you quite a nice basic foundation of chess but then just like a good coach, it gives you exercises and references great players and their mistakes!"
4,Good But Too Advanced For Young Players,"I bought this book for my son who is a beginner and it seems unsuitable for him. The book begins teaching rules of the game but progresses very quickly to game strategies, chess psychology and example games. I would only expect adults or older kids to enjoy reading this book. It's very wordy and the illustrations are completely technical.It's a good book for those serious about chess theory, but younger children won't be interested in reading it."
3,Not really for beginners.,"I have not played chess in years and this is a decent refresher. If you are new to the game I would find another book,"
2,But what IS nationalism,"Amazingly, the author wrote a book about nationalism and is constantly assessing ideologies in relation to nationalism (e.g., to him, religious fundamentalism is LIKE nationalism, but is not IDENTICAL TO nationalism)...but he never provides a clear definition OF nationalism!! I read chapter 1 over and over in search of a definition and couldn't find one. There must be a problem when the pivotal variable isn't clearly defined. It's a miracle you got as far as you did with this fuzzy work, Mr. Pfaff."
5,Best Documentary Ever,This documentary should be viewed by every American Male! It explains distinctly what is happening yo he Blacks im America by the Voice of Blacks.
4,Black Men video,Excellent video with a very positive message. I am a white man and I have a black son in law. I gave it to him and he enjoyed it very much!
2,This is an incomplete thought...,"Ok- not only do I read a lot but I do watch some TV. I eagerly purchased this video with high hopes and I was kind of left hanging... Poorly data supported information with a constant deluge of opinions from conservative, republican black men who slam fellow black men and black females who are single parents. A flash in the pan if there ever was one, the idea is original and very needed - too bad the ""food for thought"" did not leave the viewer very well fed."
5,what black men think,"This was educating and eye opening, life changing, soul transforming. It should be a requirement for all young, blacks living in america."
2,Didn't quite get it ...,"I bought this in the hopes that I could show it in a class on American culture. It was a bit expensive (ordered from America, sent to Japan). It didn't have subtitles (always problematic, if you want it to be used or enjoyed by non-native English speakers), and I just didn't find it particularly interesting, or informative. Maybe it deserves a second viewing, and deeper consideration, but my opinion from watching it once was that the filming was odd (did I have a bad copy, or did they mean for it to look like that?) and it didn't catch my interest. Perhaps it is meant to motivate Black men, more than it is to educate people in general."
2,I Thought I was going to Be Better,What Black Men Think was so so. I thought it was going to be better.
5,Make It Plain and Keeping it Real,"Bro. Morton this documentary is right on point! I share the same feelings that you do regarding how we are perceived in the media. More importantly, our young brothers and sisters do not realize how the media has drawn them into an apathetic mind set towards school and education.The media knows excatly what it is doing. Unfortunately, most of us don't.The half truths and whole lies reinforces what they want us to believe about us. This movie is a must show for all real educators and people concerned about Black folks and our future. Make a pitch to Tom Joyner and Micheal Basiden. They need to have you on their shows. THINKHBCU.ORG"
3,Interesting Perspectives,"This is a compilation of remarks from a number of successful black men who are leading a movement to get the black community into an era of self help. Many are people like Juan Williams (Enough) and Bill Cosby who have already stated a position on this issue. The DVD suggests that many of the problems of blacks have been exagerated by those who have a vested interest in the continueing subjagation of black men. For example, the question is asked, ""Are there more black men in jail or in college?"" Because of media hype, the general consensus is jail, but in fact not only overall, but by age group segmentation, there are infinitely more in college. That answer does not help some social service agencies, for example who depend on the black male as a client base. While the concept and content is interesting, the production values are a bit mediocre."
4,SPEECHLESS!!!!,"I was speechless!! I sat with a few friends and watched this film in amazement of the information I was hearing. When I say that we were all astounded by this enlightening experience, you had to be there. We all had our mouths open, jaws dropped in disbelief. I have loaned my dvd to family members, who themselves were shocked. I have spokent to my childs teacher and suggested that she view it, then speak on it and share with her class. Our children need to be educated about the real truth of the black community. I have been pushed to do my own research on issues that I hear in the media. We all need to do the same and stop believing that the media has our best interest. ""THEY DON'T""! I will be sending out this DVD as gifts. Janks Morton thank and please continue to share your knowledge. Job well done!!"
4,Provocative alternative view,"Janks Morton has entered the socio-political arena with his first film, a look at what SOME black men think. Guided by a libertarian perspective, Morton examines common myths about black men and explodes those myths with data... as he drops some sandbags along the way. That heart disease and diabetes are not the leading cause of death for black men will come as a surprise to many.Morton is extremely accessible and eager to discuss his work. A Part II film is on the way."
2,I guess my expectations were too high,"I had heard the author interviewed on NPR and was very much interested. But the interview was more entertaining than the actual book. Barr's use of the English language was better than I had expected in a novel such as this, but sometimes I got the feeling she was too impressed with her command of vocabulary and ability to make obscur references. The character development was thin, the outcome predictable, and her feeling for being in a cave unsatisfying. I was just left with the feeling of wanting more."
2,"Interesting caving descriptions, uninteresting mystery","The first part of this novel which focuses on a cave rescue was very interesting, but it descended into tedium after that. The main character was very bland and the mystery hardly heart-pounding. The second half of the book was slow and dull and even when the mystery was solved, it hardly seemed worth a novel length story. If I hadn't bought the book (in hardcover) I would not even have bothered finishing it."
3,Great description of caving.,"Nevada Barr makes you feel you are right there, wherever her books take you. Those who love meticulous description of her various environs will enjoy her stories, but those who love a great mystery story will be disappointed, particularly with this book."
4,Anna once again takes me places I've never been. Great!!,"Anna's personality continues to unfold with each adventure. She is one tough lady and gets in the most dangerous situations one can imagine. However, she is no superhero, her very real fears and weaknesses make the tales exciting and believable. AND WONDERFULLY ENTERTAINING!!! I can't wait to get to Liberty Falling. Keep 'em coming, I love 'em."
4,Totally absorbing - makes you feel the claustrophobia!,"Anna is thrown into yet another mysterious situation, this time where she fears most - a cave. Ms. Barr is very adept at bringing other characters from her previous novels, while explaining to you who they are and tying them back into the previous books. I could not put this book down - the chapters are ended as cliffhangers, and you just want to keep on reading. Ms. Barr has a wonderful knack for description, and you feel as if you're in the Carlsbad Caverns with Anna. I would have liked to see her get together with Curt, but that's just romantic wishful thinking. This is just as exciting as her other novels, especially if you like the great outdoors."
4,extremely well-written,This is the first of this authors' books I had read. I'm hooked! The writing is so much better than nearly all other mystery writers. Give this author a try.
1,A disappointment,"I really liked previous Anna Pigeon mysteries, but Blind Descent was so tedious I could hardly read it. There is too much technical detail on climbing through caves -- which the author has developed more fully than the characters."
3,ambivalent,"I wanted to like this book, but I just can't pull it off. The literary allusions don't suit Anna's character, and it annoyed me that she'd make flawless references to the 7th OZ book but then mangle every Bible quotation. How did Anna get through Catholic school thinking ""Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death"" is the FIRST line of the 23rd psalm? The ending fell apart as well - after all the talk about how dark cave darkness is, how you can't see anything you don't have a light trained on, Anna is suddenly able to . . . well, no spoilers, but somehow in the last three chapters there's apparently an ambient light source. Between the tedious descriptions of caving gear, rock formations and climbing techniques, the literary allusions and political references, Barr seems a little too, ""I'm so smart and politically correct, look at me"" for my tastes."
1,"Nevada Barr, Blind Descent","I'm afraid to start another book by Nevada Barr. This was my test book for her and it was so tedious and boring, I had to skip lots of it to finish it. Sorry."
1,Blind Descent,"I have enjoyed most of Nevada Barr's books but this one was too long in the tooth on the technicality of spelunking. Only someone who is a caver would be interested in this book and I am not. She goes into too much detail re the rigging and climbing techniques. How many people really cave who read her books? I find the rest of her jaunts through the Southwest and the MidWest and Lake Superior where I used to live enjoyable, but a cave? Not enough people who would be interested in all the explanation of it. I was very disappointed that I had spent the money on this book & wish I had gone to the library to get it to read. Was a waste of time and money. Only could recommend it to cavers, who I am sure, would be very interested and rate this 5 stars"
5,Nevada Barr knows how to keep one on the edge of one's seat!,"The descriptions are very well done. I shudder at the tight places in the crawling through the cave, and shiver with Anna at the 'prickly moments'."
4,Sudden Descent,"I could just picture this descent into the vast caves of Carlsbad Caverns. Quite a trek, I have a certain amount of claustrophobia and could no more do just a trip. It was quite chilling.Anna is a great author. Where she gets her ideas? There must be a great amount of research in all her works."
5,Takes You In From The Beginning!,"One of my favorite Anna Pigeon Books! I Like Them All but this one is probably my favorite, Read It!"
5,Holy Cow!,"My dentist recommended this book when I told her I'd been to Carlsbad NP & was headed to Wind Cave NP. And I was not disappointed. I've never been drawn to mysteries before, and I was pleasantly surprised. My introduction to Ranger Pigeon did not suffer although I picked her up mid-series. Her descriptions of the caves and parks, and the people who frequent, them is dead-on. She scared the be-jeebies out of me, and increased my appreciation of caves, National Parks, and Rangers 100-fold. I've been inspired to start at the beginning with Track of the Cat, and I can see now how much better Ms. Barr gets with age!"
4,Not for the claustrophobic!,"This book was good, as are all of Nevada Barr's novels but the cave crawling really gave me the willies. I had a hard time reading parts of it because I just felt SO constricted. That is how good the descriptions are!I have enjoyed this series and hope it will continue for years to come. Anna Pigeon is a flesh and bone woman with real fears, strengths and weaknesses. This is the most least enjoyed of the series for me (and that's not a bad thing because I still enjoyed it!)."
3,Not as good as some of her others.,"I found Blind Descent to be a bit tiresome at times. If I had been a caver or perhaps had a better knowledge of cave terminology, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I found myself struggling to see the caverns in my mind and I could not create a picture. In addition to this, the ending left me feeling kind of flat. I found myself wanting some follow-up, which was not there. The story was good for the most part and I enjoyed most of it. I would recommend it, but I don't think it is one of her best works."
5,Another View of a familiar tale,A wonderful alternative/addition to those who only know Yul Brenner as the king.No singing; more of the real Siam.
4,Classy Movie with Claasy Actress,"Anna and The King of Siam stars one of my favorite actresses. Irene Dunne has always been a star with tons of class and in this movie you can see why she was so popular in the 30s and 40s. The movie differs from the musical stage hit The King and I, but it is, nevertheless, very enjoyable. The sets, the photography and Rex Harrison as the King are all superb."
1,Massive and unnecessary surgery on a classic,"Literary translation requires a balancing act between word-for-word interpretation and more liberal paraphrase. Anthony Burgess has gone farther than that, concocting an English version of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" that is better classed an adaptation rather than a translation. He excises characters whom he doesn't like, reduces Roxane's appearance in the play, implants poems and speeches which were never in the original, and generally reworks the play into something other than the original. But worse still is the language - snotty, excessively erudite, and giving Cyrano an extremely bitter and obnoxious tone. I've read five other English versions of ""Cyrano,"" and frankly this is my least liked, as if a surgeon unnecessarily cut off the legs of a healthy patient."
2,No Improvement,"Although I am an Anthony Burgess fan, I find this translation to be nowhere near as good as the classic Brian Hooker translation."
4,"Beautifully written, but a non-comprehensable protagonist.","The book overall was excellent, but I thought Cyrano made many stupid and irratic decisions for such a seemingly intelligent person. Maybe it was his love for Roxane that made him act so foolishly, but it confused me. It seems as if Rostand couldn't decide whether to make Cyrano an intellect, or a fool; an extravagent comedian, or a tragic poet. Picking one personality would make Cyrano seem more realistic, instead of making him appear to have multiple personality disorder. Many people have different personalities, but not with the extremities that Cyrano possesses, unless they stopped taking their prescription of Prozac, which in my opinion, Cyrano needs."
3,Short Romantic Play Written in the Realist Times,"I found the book to have good poems within the play. It had its dull points, but it is also had some good action. I found it boring, but what do I know!"
1,worst story ever,i disliked this story because it was dull and dry. i know it was true i just did'nt like it. sadako is a 12 year old who gets to be on her schools relay team. the she finds out she has leukimia and based on a japanese legend she folds paper cranes. in japanese legend if you fold 1000 paper cranes you get one wish. in the end she dies.i did'nt learn much from this but what i did learn is a spider and a sunny day are japanese good luck charms and they have their own memorial day in japan to honor those who the bomb killed.i would recomend this story to people who like sad storiesbecause this story is one of them.
1,Sadako Book Review by: Vikram,"Sadako Book ReviewI think Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes was not a good book is by Eleanor Coerr.I don't like this book because I like action-packed books, classics, and mysteries. Also, I did not like this book because it was so sad and I don't like sad books. Sadako is very brave, excited,hopeful, strong, and lively. The book tells you about Japanese culture and about folding paper cranes. .I recommend this book to anyone who likes biography books."
1,sadako,"I disliked this book,sadako and the thousond paper cranes.in the story,sadako likes to run she got dizzy then she wentto the hospital.After reading the story,I felt bad for sadakobecause of what she was going through.I would recommend thisbook to whoever likes to read books."
1,sadako's cranes,"In the story, Sadako was running and she fell and had to go to the hospital were she had Leukemia and she made paper cranes to get well but she croaked before she makes 1,000. I learned That Leukemia is a blood cancer. This would be a good book for people who like cranes."
1,a great book,"This is a bad book. It is sad and a horrible book. Do not pick up this book. If you want to read it, now you know it is a bad book. I do not recommend it. If you are thinking of going to the book store and wasting your money on a book like this, forget about it. But I'll tell you about it anyway. It is about a girl named Sadako who gets very sick. She has a friend named Chizuko. She is Sadako's best friend. Sadako is a fast runner. She gets leukemia and goes to the hospital. Chizuko tells her that if she makes a thousand cranes, she will not have leukemia. Her brother promises to hang the cranes. Will she make one thousand?"
3,Sadako and the one thousand paper cranes,"I loved the story and enjoyed reading it with my 9 year old son. However we purchased a ""new"" copy but received one that had hand written numbers inside the front cover. It looked like it was written in texta. I wouldn't have bought if if I'd known about that."
3,sadako,I don't recommend this book to people with sensitive feelings because people were crying in my class when we finished the book. I also recommend it because it's a short read. My friends like it because she was brave and didn't give up on the cranes.
4,A Wonderful Story,"I read this book called ""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes"" because it was so interesting and please buy this book!!! I thought it was sad and exciting. Sadako gets leukemia and she likes to run and make paper cranes. Sadako likes to celebrate Oban Day and go to Memorials. If you want to learn more about ""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes"" buy it now!!!"
5,Still makes me cry,"I read this when I was in grade school and I pick it up again every so often. It's a great children's book, written simply enough to be understood but powerful enough to get a message across."
5,the cranes,"I really think you should read Sadako and the thousand paper crane it's a great story, is about a girl that gets affected from leukemia. She gets worse along the time. She makes a lot of paper canes. Find out how many she made!! That story is one of the best stories I ever read. Read it so you could find out what happens in the end!!!"
5,A Thousand Paper Cranes,"Reviewed by- Trish BushA thousand paper crazes I give it 5 stars because the book is about a Japanese girl who discovers that she has leukemia and bravely faces it. In many ways the book is dramatic. It makes you think,'' Will this happen to me? Do I have Leukemia? It's a really good book and I recommend it."
5,"Great book, great price","This is a great book for home, school, hospital, or therapist office. Great for ages 5-105! The hard cover makes it a little more durable. If you are shopping for the Thousand Paper Crane story, do not hesitate!"
5,"Educating, sweet, and heartbreaking.","I highly recommend this book. It took me 40 minutes to read to my 2 boys, ages 5 and 10. They cried with me and we were all intrigued by the story of Sadako and her family. we are anxious to learn all about origami and plan to learn how to do origami and hope to one day visit Hiroshima and see Sadako's statue."
4,Sadako,I like the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes .In the story Sadako gets leukemia from the atomic bomb.I learned that there was a bomb dropped.I feel sorry for the people because they had leukemia and died at twelve.I would recommend this book to everyone because it tells about the past and it could happen again.
2,Sadako,I didn't like the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. In the story Sadako had leukemia.From reading the story I learned that Sadako was a real person . I also learned that if you make a thousand paper cranes you get one wish.After reading the story I felt sad because a lot of people died from the atomic bomb. I would recommend this book to people who like sad stories because a bunch of people die.
5,Sadako Lives,"Sadako Review Sadako and a thousand paper Cranes Sadako's Friend Kenji had Leukemia because when her mom was going to have him, U.S dropped the atom Bomb in Hiroshima. My teacher read t6he story to my class you should buy the book."
4,review sadako,This is a story about a girl that lived in Japan. Then one day while she was in a big race she felt a dizziness... After a few days Sadako felt better then one day Sadako was running in the school yard. Then suddenly some thing happened read Sadako and the thousand paper cranes to know the end.
4,The life of Sadako,"I read ""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes"" by Eleaner Coerr because I really thought it was interesting. I thought it would be a great book and it was! There was this girl named Sadako that had Leukemia from the atomic bomb. I thought that Sadako was a fun reading book and a sad book. Sadako likes to run and she joins in for a track team. After she finished racing in the relay race, Sadako became very dizzy! Find out what happens in the end when you read ""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes""!"
1,Insipid and Preachy,"This book about a Japanese kid dying of Leukemia was both falsely moralistic and, even worse, boring. That Sadako dies before finishing the cranes would be more depressing if the audience was more inspired to care either way. The implied accusation against the U.S. actions in WWII is the crime of using emotional appeal to convince children to take an uninformed opinion regarding a complex historical event.This is the kind of book schools assign to 10-year-olds as an attempt to get them to 'connect with death and their feelings'. If your child brings this book home, read it yourself (holding your nose) and call the teacher....And making those little cranes is only mildly amusing."
2,disappointment,"I heard the story from a teacher and wrote down the title but I guess this is a different version. This book is very thin and it was really not as good as I heard. I bought it for my daughter. If I had the chance to see the book the teacher had, I would never purchase this book."
3,Sadako Review,"I would recommend this book if you like sad books. It is good but has some sad parts in it. It is a very good book and exciting in some ways. You always want to know what's going to happen next. I liked the book and it was very interesting when it tells about Sadako in the beginning. The book tells a lot about what happened when she was a baby and tells more about when she was older. I'm not going to tell you what happen, just in case you want to read it and figure that out."
4,A Book Review Of Sadako,"My opinion of Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes is that it is a good story, but some parts are sad. Like the end, it's sad, but all in all, it's a good read. I like the book because it is forever interesting. It has that ability to make you want to keep reading until you finish the book. The story tells the story of a young girl named Sadako and her adventures. She faces complicated and easy challenges. Sadako's bold character makes the book even better. I would recomend the book to anyone who is interested in Japanese culture, or someone simply looking for a good book."
5,A Good Discussion Opener,"I read this book for my children's literature class at Kent Stark University. I read it to myself at first and later decided to share it with my 7 and 8 year old boys. It brought on so much discussion. We spent a lot of time stopping in the middle of the book and answering their questions. It brought up issues of the war. What is war? Are we ever going to be in a war? Why do countries have wars? It also brought out question about death and disease. What is cancer? Can the doctors ever make is go away? Why did Sadako die when she was just a kid? Even though this was a very short book, we as a family spent many hours in good conversation. It helped us in our ""bonding process"" to be able to discuss these sometimes difficult issues that children might not bring up on their own."
5,Thousands of Affected Lives!,This is one of my favorite books to read with my class! I highly recommend that you buy this book. The story demonstrates the effects of war outside of the immediate physical destruction from combat.As you read about Sadako you will grow to love her spirit and courage as she strives to join the relay running team and faces the challenges that come when she develops leukemia. This book also provides insight into the Japanese culture.I encourage you to read this book and find out how Sadako will live on in your heart too.
5,"Very moving, unforgettable story",Sadako is an unforgettable character. This is an excellent novel to teach about the Japanese culture as well as about Japan during this historical time period.
4,This is the saddest book I've ever read.,The story made me think about life and illness and my family. This was a true story.
3,A Exiciting Book,"I thought this book was an okay book. I would recommend this book to people who like sad books.This book is about a Japanese girl named Sadako who found out that she had a terrible virus called leukemia, an atom bomb disease. To save herself she finds out a cure.The cure is to fold a thousand paper cranes and the gods will make her healthy again.This book tells about hardships and deadly things that can happen to a average family. I would give this book a three stars."
2,Sadako,"Sadako and the Thousand Paper CranesI didn't like the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, because it was sad. I usually like happy books,edventurs, and mysteries. It was an okay book for a sad book. I liked the plot,except the end. Sadako was my favorite character, because she tried everything she wanted to do."
3,"A fraud, however charming","A book that purports to be a true story should tell the truth. In this version of the story, poor Sadako pops off before finishing a thousand cranes. In reality, she did over 1300 and still died. I think that's a much more moving story and points out there is no panacea for the horror of atomic weapons. You can see some of the cranes in the A-bomb museum in Hiroshima."
2,Sadako and the Thousand Paper Crane Review,"I don't think that other kids would like reading this book. One reason being is that the characters are not believable because Sadako said that she remembered when the bomb went off in Hiroshima. I find that hard to believe since she was only a baby when the bomb went off. Also, I do not like the story because Sadako and her brother died of leukemia, a deadly disease that caused millions of Japanese people to die. This is a very depressing story because when Sadako was running (doing what she loved to do) at school and she fainted. She was taken to the hospital and she was diagnosed with leukemia. The part in the story when Sadako's friend comes to the hospital to visit her and tells her the story of the thousand paper cranes is not believable because it is a myth. This is a sad story as Sadako is a young girl. These are the reasons that I do not like the story of ""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes.""Elizabeth M.Age 11Deer Park MMS"
3,Not a good book for 3rd Graders.,"This book was given to my 8 year old daughter to read at school. It upset her so much, that she suffered anxiety attacks for a month. While I rate this book as ""Okay"" it is not for young readers. I think its for age 12 or 13 and up. I just wanted to warn other parents to be careful with the content of the books your children read."
3,My Book Reveiw,"I did not really like this book that much. This is because it was a little surprising in what happens. In the end, I would give it about 3 stars. If you like sad books, then this is the one for you. The book is exiting in a way but also interesting. I don't like sad books but you might. In the beginning, it is a 5 star book, then it becomes a 4 star book, then a 3 star book. That is my book review of Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. The book was based on World War Two and a little girl who gets leukemia."
3,A Disappointing Book,"I think the book was ok. It wasn't the best but, it was pretty good. My favorite part was the festival but apart from that, I thought that the book was pretty boring. The ending of the book was sort of disappointing because she she should have had the chance to make the very last crane. I also think that this book was really easy. I am reading books in small print and this one had pretty big print. I think that you will agree with me when you read this book."
5,"A story of strength, courage, and love",My daughter read this book at the insistence of her Japanese grandmother. It is a touching story of family and courage during a very tragic time. My 10 yr old daughter came to love Sadako as millions of Japanese children today who lay paper cranes on her statue at the anniversary of the atomic bomb. My daughter recommends this book but cautions that the Japanese names and words would make tricky reading for younger children.
5,Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes,"I am 8 years old and I read this book in my third grade class. I loved this book because it reminds me to always have hope and courage. Although some parts of the book are sad, most of the story is happy. I recommend that children and adults read this book."
4,READ ME!,"Dear Reader,""Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes""is an awsome book.It starts off pretty slow at first and then you will start leaning into the book like you're watching a movie!The book is about a girl who gets an extaeme illness.Her friend tells her an old legend that says that if she make a thousand paper cranes then she will be cured.Does she do it?Find out by reading this book!Jade N.Age 12"
4,sadako,"I sort of like the book sadako,in the book she is brave and has faith.I learned not to give up.After I read the story I felt sad because she died I would tell adults to read this book because It is more for adults."
5,Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes,"In the story,Sadako was kinda sad because she dies of leukemia. But the rest was exciting and fun to read, it had a lot of events. From reading the story, I learned that Sadako was always in pain, and that she loved to run. After reading the story, I felt sad because she dies at the age of 12. I hope we never have the atomic bomb again. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because it is interesting but it will be boring if you don't like to read. JUST TRY THE BOOK IT WILL BE FUN TO READ!"
2,sadako and the thousand papper cranes review,I disliked the book because its not a book I would read.In the story Sadako got a cancer called leukemia it is caused by radiation caused by the atom bomb. In the story she made paper cranes to get better she died before she made a thousand paper cranes.I learned that when your blood count goes down you are losing white blood cells.I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
4,Sadako,"I would recommend this book to anyone. In my opinion, it was ok because some sad things happened in the story. This is a true story about a girl that got leukemia and went to the hospital. Her friend told her that if she made 1,000 paper cranes she would get better. Sadako only made 632 cranes. In the beginning, this book was good and then it got boring. I would rate this book 4 stars because it was sad."
2,Tanya Tucker,"I found about 3 or 4 good songs, but over all I was disappointed. Roy Acuff is much better on just about everything."
4,Tanya's Early-80's Hits,"These are Tanya's ""less country, more pop"" tunes from the early 80s. Some even with (gasp!) Glen Campbell! Yeah, their gently rockin', uptempo duet of Bobby Darin's ""Dream Lover"" is included here. And you can hear Glen on background in the catchy ""Can I See You Tonite."" ""Somebody Buy This Cowgirl a Beer"" written by the late Shel Silverstein is funny. Also fun is the do-woppy, recorded by the Pointer Sisters, ""Should I Do It?"" Too bad they didn't include more stuff from the album this appeared on, ""Should I Do It?"" That had some good tunes, like Leo Sayer's ""Stormy Weather"" featuring Tanya singing with Emmylou Harris. If you like the more L.A., pop-sounding Tanya, this is the collection for you!"
3,From Mother Of One Of Russell's Victims,"I am the mother of one of Russell's victims in Jack Olsen's book ""Charmer."" George Russell attacked my daughter, she almost died ... she was given the Last Rites while in a coma state at the hospital. My daughter, however, was one of the luckiest of his victims and, by the grace of God, survived his brutal attack. There was much more that could have been told about Russell's brutality and the savagery of his crimes that are not in this book. It took me five years before I had the courage to buy and read ""Charmer,"" but I'm glad I did. His book gives you good insight into this maniac killer. Prison is too good for this animal."
5,Scared the heck out of me!,"I read lots and lots of true crime, and find Jack Olsen's novels to be among some of the best. Normally the stories themselves don't stay w/me for very long after I read them, but Charmer gave me goosebumps. This story of a charming young man with a secret life as a cat burgler and abuser/murderer of women horrified me. When some of the women who'd lived with and cared about him described the psychological games he'd play with them, like breaking into their homes and leaving threatening notes on their bed, or simply breaking into their homes and watching them while they slept I actually shuddered. Creepy and horrifying from the get go, and definitely one that will have you leaving your lights on long after you finish it!"
1,Don't bother reading this one,This book was probably the most boring I have read. I truly tried to get through it but I finally gave up during the second part. The author rambles on and on while not revealing anything of substance. It is an extremely slow read. Do not buy it for you'll waste your money. BORING !!!!
4,Good Effort,"First of all, please ignore the references to Nashville Star, The TV show Barely Famous, etc {both good shows...but,} please just listen to their music.In my opinion, they are a refreshing change. Almost ""Country Rock"". I love to hear the guitar in their songs.With his CD, I was disappointed at first when I heard ""Sell a Lot of Beer"" because it wasn't the commercial version I'd heard on the radio. This version starts as almost acoustic. Then after listening to it a few times, it grew on me to the point that I was embarrassed that I had fallen in to the ""Commercial"" trap and didn't really listen to this different version with an open mind. Once I did I loved it.These guys are immensely talented whether they are performing their own songs, or letting another artist do it. {They've written for Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Lynyrd Skynrd, Van Zant among others. That speaks for itself."
2,I'm a sucker for a good deal--but skeptical,"I was browsing Home Depot one day and saw the Z700 stacked in a middle aisle. I was impressed by the high-tech look but it seemed awfully heavy for a bagless vacuum cleaner. I couldn't beat the price for $99 and needed a vac for stairs because I noticed the long stretchable hose. Forget the vacuum-powered stairway brush - none of them work. They all stall out. It is effective for the price though. Like I said, I only use it for stairs. It's too heavy to lug anywhere else. I feel sorry for whoever paid over $400 for their's. The suction isn't that great but it does have neat ""bells and whistles"". BTW, I also have a Kenmore and self-propelled Hoover that are much better. (The Kenmore is the best!)"
2,Not So Hot Vac,Had this vac for over a year now and find it is not so hot for the price. It's been in for repair twice and is about to make a third trip (after a certain amount of time it seems the suction just gives up). My biggest gripe with the thing is that it weighs a ton and is awkward and difficult to maneuver. Wouldn't really tell a friend to buy one (I own a Kenmore that I've had for years that still performs to expectations).
1,"Expensive, trendy, junk","Funny how people will give these thing high reviews and they've only had it for a couple of weeks.At 6 months, the telescoping handle has broken. (duct tape repair)The handle assembly has become very loose.The mechanism that takes it from a canister to a upright malfunctions half the time. (someone else who gave this thing 4 stars said the same thing) Wait another few weeks and the rest of it will start breaking.For $300 you can buy a MUCH better vac.Luckily, I got mine a home Depot for $99 on clearance. They had a whole bundle of them for that price and yes they were new. Wonder why the low price? Now I know!"
1,Expensive piece of junk,"Very heavy weight, the exhaust blows the dirt around before you get the chance to vacuum it up, the cord is low on the unit and in a box with a door/cover that has a poorly designed clasp that breaks (you are always holding and dealing with the cord while using the unit), the lights are BS and illuminate *nothing*, and it has an airway access cover that always falls out and is *very* difficult to re-install (get out the tape and forget the cover). If I knew what I knew now I would never have purchased the unit."
5,Jerry Clowers-Greatest Hits,It was so funny.I LOD the whole time I was listning to CD.I am so glad I purched it.I got it very fast in the mail too.I love amazon for buying things
2,not a fan,the bigs one were to big so they all went in the trash and the small ones well some were really tight and others were good..you do have to cut the to fix to fingers but i will stick to what i know works for me and it wasnt theses
2,Too Tight,"These things are way too tight. You put them on and in minutes your fingers loose all blood, turn white/blue. May be good for a person that is considered ""small"" in rubber glove size. But a person with ""medium"" and above glove size wont fit."
4,High quality,"These mats are nice and high quality. Heavy rubber. Don't mistake these for the edge to edge floor liners you see on TV.. They are universal so not an exact fit, but they look and feel great. The flames are raised and appear to be solid color (not just a coating of color over the black) - from what I can tell. My only real complaint is that they don't have much of a lip on the edge to keep the water on the mat and off the carpet underneath."
4,Spyro,The game is a little different and a little more confusing. I am a Spyro fan so I still think it is a must have.
3,Fun but different,"After the last game Spyro Enter The Dragonfly, I wasn't about to put out 50 bucks again so I decided to rent it first. Turns out it's not bad. It's not the same as the first 3 but it's ok. The levels are huge, the graphics are vivid and the controls work really well. The story and missions are about the same but hey, it's Spyro.I think that the music and ""Monet Skies"" that were used in the first 3 Spyro's gave it a magical feel and that is lacking in this game. The new music gives the game a Caribbean feel. I also don't like what they did to the character of Moneybags. He was a English stuffy snob in the first 3 and they should have left him alone. I can't pinpoint the accent but they made him really obnoxious.I also don't like the new voices. They are horrible! Spyro use to have a little bit of an edge but his new voice makes him very wimpy.All in all the game was fun to play and I've decided to buy it."
5,Must get,"If you didn't play this game as a kid, you had no childhood. It is one of the best childhood games I could think of."
3,Decent,"This is a step up from Enter the Dragonfly, but doesn't live up to the original trilogy on the PlayStation 1. The voice acting is rather annoying for certain characters. The gems... I don't really like what they did with the gems. Really, this game is different than most Spyro games. It's decent, but I just don't enjoy it as much as past (*cough* PS1 Spyro *cough*) Spyro games. I do not like Blink or whatever the heck the name of that new mole-rocket-shooting character is. But, it's a decent game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,A fun game,This spyro game was fun but not nearly as great as the old Spyro playstation games. Nothing will ever be better than those games to me but if you are looking to play a new spyro game I would say that this is the best of the PS2 spyro games.
1,Horrible,"It is nothing like the original. Even Spyro looks different. Ever since Insomniac sold the rights to Spyro, all the Spyro games besides the 3 for the PS1 Insomniac made stink. Don't get this game! They even switched the ram and fire button (now ram is Circle and fire is Square). This game is not worth $20. Don't buy it. Now that i have played it, I would not have gotten it if it were free- this game is so bad, its hard to describe. Its probally the worst sequal to a good game I've ever played- don't even consider getting it."
3,Not released,I am amazed that people can give such great reviews to a game that was just released today.
3,"I Love It, But...","I got this game joyfully at the store, played it and after about a month, even though there wasn't a single scratch on the disc, it messed up for good. I tried to load my game (yes, it was on the memory card) and I get this: data cannot be found. I retry, retry, and retry, and all I get is: data cannot be found. So I decided to test my disc. I made another file on my other memory card, played it for about 4 days, then the next day I try, I get: data cannot be found. I checked both of my memory cards, and they both still had files! I still get that phrase to this day."
1,P.O.S,"as the saga continues with spyro, the games get worse and worse. in the first spyro spyro was some what of a bad as*. he just wanted to go out there and toarch gnork. now he has became a pansy. everything has grown too soft for the true spryo fan to enjoy. dont waste your money. all the good spyro games have come and gone along with the playstation."
5,"Spyro Fans, THIS IS A MUST-BUY!","When I saw this game in the shops, I thought 'It doesn't look like a normal Spyro game.' and didn't buy it. Soon after, my friends bought it. We played for hours on the game. When I came home, I begged to buy the game.This Spyro game has the best graphics of them all, and one of the best story plots. It has large, colourful levels filled with collectables. There are more playable characters and mini games to play. So don't judge the game by its cover, buy it because this game is the best Spyro game yet!"
2,the company better hear this,Sypro the dragon games were always fun except the GBA versions. But this is worse than that! And that was pretty bad to begin with. Like I said they were about fun and thinking but this game only focuses on toughness. And the boss namely Red cheat big time and everybody elde seems to have got stuiper even the Professor. And Blinx's levels are the worst with those hard jumps which is the easiest way to annoy a gamer. So from a pro don't get this game rent if you just want to see how lame the series has gotten.
5,Spyro: A Hero's Tail rocks!!!,"I don't have this game yet, however, I happen know that 3 days from now I'm getting it for Christmas. And I have the demo of this game. It rocks!!! When I beat the game, I'll give advice to those having trouble with the game!!! See ya!"
4,Consistant with the rest of the series,"A must for diehard Spiro fans! Some challenges are frustrating, especially for players age ten or under. If you have a bit of patience during certain timed mini-games, you'll probably enjoy this one as well as you did it's predecessors!!!"
5,Spyro: A Hero's Tail,"I have the demo disk of this and I played it. As it turned out, it was awesome!!! The graphics are pretty great and all. There is a few strange and different things. They all have different voices(except Blink because he hasn't been in recent games), Moneybags is looking different now, and The flame button used to be the circle button and now it is the square button. Charge used to be the square button now it is the circle button. When I first played this game, I thought it wouldn't be all that great. It was!!! I might be getting this for Christmas. If I do, I will play it for quite a while. Since we'll probably have winter break off in school during December,(If I get the game that is)I will play this game constantly. And for all those Spyro Fans out there, I just want you to know this: I am Spyro's Number#1 Fan!! Well, see ya."
3,Ok for the $,"Over priced but she likes it, so if you like to buy over priced games for your lady to make her happy, here you go. LOL."
1,"Questionable Edits, Appalling Sound","Muted bass, analog hiss, and the questionable editing of ""Liar"" and ""Old Fashioned Love Song"" prove that somebody dropped the ball somewhere. While this collection does include all the Top 40 ""hits"", avoid this disc like the plague. Turn instead to the ""Celebrate"" compilation (MCA), with its remastered originals."
2,"bad sound plus no ""Mama Told Me(Not to Come)""?!?!","I don't own this disc(but I do have the lp copy), so I can't say anything about the sound quality only that I read another review that mentions it. My only qualm is that it never included ""Mama Told Me(Not to Come)""(1970), their first no.1 single, but instead has ""I'd Be So Happy""(1974), a much lower-charted song.(Not to mention no ""Easy To Be Hard"" and ""Eli's Coming"",both from '69). But I never liked those two that much anyway. I'd recomend the newly released(May,'04) ""Complete Hit Singles"" compilation that includes all 21 of their 1969-74 top 40 hits on one disc."
1,I recommend the Best of 3 Dog Night retrospective anthology!,"I've heard all these songs before that are on my the Best of Three Dog Night compilation collection disc. Except for the one song called ""I'd Be So Happy"" is different that I nevered heard of or listened to on this 14 song tracks listing album CD. So I think this greatest hits disc is definitively not enough for a package!"
1,Picture shows Eureka brand bags but received DVC instead,"The picture and description of the product is genuine Eureka brand bags. But I was sent a substitute DVC brand, which I bet are a cheap knock-off. I am returning them."
5,eureka vacuum bags,Great value for the price. We had a hard time finding these until we went on Amazon.com - you can find pretty much everything there! Thanks for a great website!
1,"Incense of the West, ""Hickory""","Incense, smells nice, is not ""Hickory"" nor anything close. Sure, it smells like burning wood... nothing like ""Hickory"".[...]I don't know if this package was MISMARKED or just falsely advertised."
2,C THOMAS MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF...AGAIN,"Brat packer C. Thomas Howell has matured as a nice looking fellow, but unfortuntely LAST LIVES is not a showcase for any acting talent the man may have.In this one, we have parallel worlds in which a convicted killer is convinced that a bride to be in the other world is destined to be his bride. So he and two ruthless killers are transported into her world, shoot up her wedding and kidnap the unsuspecting bride. One major gimmick is that Howell is provided with life bands from the mad scientist that enable him to die and come back to life.This isn't a bad premise but the acting and execution are just subpar. Jennifer Ruben as the heroine; Judge Reinhold as the wacky professor, and especially Billy Wirth as Malakai, the nutcase, are just terrible in their roles and the movie's low budget doesn't help either.For diehard scifi fans only."
3,Perplexing.,"This doesn't appear to be what I thought it was when I purchased it. It sounded like a live recording featuring many great blues artists sharing the same stage. Instead, it appears it may be just yet another blues compilation cd. The closer I listen to those JLH tracks, the more convinced I am that they are studio recordings. The same is true of the rest of the tracks. There is no audience noise, no stage banter, nothing spontaneous that would indicate this is a live concert. The liner notes are next to nonexistent, and are no help at all. Maybe the packaging and lack of liner notes are a deliberate attempt by the label to fool people like me into thinking this was something it's not.The truth is, it's a decent blues compilation, if that's what you're looking for. I already had plenty of those. I thought this was something entirely different, and am disappointed to report I was wrong. Unfortunately ""Soul Meeting Saturday Night"" was not a meeting at all, just a marketing gimmick."
3,Its Okay,Very nice product choose for the bathrooms of the kids and very happy with the product Think i can recomend to allThanks
1,Not my cup of beans,"This book was sent to me as a gift, and I'm glad, only in the sense I didn't buy it myself. Why anyone would find this ""mysterious"" much less interesting is beyond my imagination. This must be a self-published vanity project, because it's targeted toward a non-existent market: a juvenile mystery for kids who love early 20th century baseball ?"
5,More than pleased!,"This compilation of Paul Carrick is no less than wonderful! It's got all of his major songs, both solo and with groups. The sound is great and the songs are all really great. I'm very pleased with it! If you are a Paul Carrack fan and/or pop/rock fan, you need this in your collection! It's out-of-print, but worth looking for, I'm glad I did!"
2,This book was very disappointing.,"As a beginning to intermediate beader, this book was a disappointment to me. I guess I should have taken the title more seriously! The projects lack inspiration and the photographs are of poor quality. Many of the pictures are repetitive. I also felt that the book is not organized in a logical fashion and, although it covers wirework, it does not even mention wrapping a donut or a pendant or a basic rosary turn. If you are looking for a really good basic book on beading or you want to find some fresh new projects, this book is not for you!"
3,"Not bad, not great","This book isn't too bad, especially for beginners, and does address some basic loom work, stringing, and the most common off-loom stitches. However, it seemed the instructions were sometimes tough to follow, and the author often did things 'the hard way."" Better off buying the 'for dummies' guide to beading."
4,Very helpful book,I learned about many different types of beadworking and the basics of each. Some of the instructions were a little bit difficult to follow at times but for the most part I was able to understand them clearly. You get a lot of information about purchasing beads and all the tools you need to get started. It may be a little bit outdated but I was still very glad I bought this book.
3,A little small and the stamp was very shallow,The quality of the piece was adequate however i found the diameter of the stamp to be a little small and the shallowness of the letter didn't give me the best imprint in wax.
1,If you plan to use this as a phone consider other brand,"Go through reviews and you'll see one word comes again and again ""CLICK"". This phone ""CLICK""s very loud and annoying all through conversation. I subconciosly refrain from using this phone in a house just becouse of that. Make sure that if you buy it you have an option to return it back becouse most likely you'd need it.Also as it was noted in other posts. Battery life if 1-2 days at most. I have my old AT&T; cordless phone having 6-7 days.So basically I don't see why anybody will consider this phone in a first place."
1,Absolute Junk,"Continually 'clicks' during conversations.Menu laid out poorly (possibly by *untrained* chimp).Despite wording on box will NOT work with other Siemans phones (ok, it works except for any 'advanced' features. Advanced features must be everything except ring).Charger contacts don't work well resulting in phone beeping while resting on charger.Tech support and customer support all but non-existant.Would throw it in trash except for my >$200 investment in a pair.Still kicking myself for buying these.The perfect gift for someone you truly despise."
2,Too much clicking!,"Overall, i loved the phone. unlike other callers, i was able to make voice activated calls. also, i don't know why the seimens people would say you could not get the phone to announce caller id's -it does work. the downer is it can only announce the caller id if you have created a 'voice activating' recording for it. also, you have to make a separate voice command recording for each person in your household that wants to use the phone (and it can only hold 20 recordings total -10 for you, 10 for your spouse).i didn't have difficulties with the UI. And i love having a speakerphone in the handset (i've been buying phones with that feature for years). however, the clicking is the deal breaker. my 900mHz Sanyo has no clicking and fine sound quality. the seinmens has the caller id though and good integration with the phone company vmail."
1,Simply put - worst cordless I have ever owned,"No ""flash"" button to get to the call waiting, had to call the company and they informed me that this product was built in Germany without this feature but the work-around was to hold the Mem button for few seconds. Hold it too short - you never switch over and ultimately miss the incoming call. Hold it too long and you disconnect the call you were on first. Terrible battery life, and this is after petitioning Siemens for a new ""upgraded"" battery. Dislike the Message log functionality. Terrible buzzing and clicking when I talk. Random line interruptions. I saw some favorable reviews on this site, but my friend bought the earlier model and he has had more problems than me, if you can believe that!!!I paid almost [a lot] for this phone and all I want to do is skip it like a stone across the asphalt in some parking lot and leave it in pieces. If my review can stop just ONE person from buying this product, then I will be able to rest easier."
3,Hold the phone!,"I just returned the 4210, but why you ask. First, the sound quality is the best, and I have tried alot of cordless phones, I've experienced. The voice mail feature apparently does not support both FSK and Stutter formats, so it did not work for me. Second, no headset jack on the handset! I have a home office, so a voice mail indicator and headset are critical features for me. The build quality was second to none, afterall it's made in Germany. I liked that you could use Ni-MH AA batteries, which provides flexibility of easy replacement. The speech dial feature does in fact really work, although if you use duplicate directory entries, you'll need to enter in normal and speech directories seperately. A coworker reported hearing intermittent clicking, which while annoying wasn't a show stopper. This phone is heads and soulders above the previous 2400 series, which were horrible. It broke my heart to return it, but my Panasonic KX-TG2650N is still the KING. Buy smartly."
2,Siemens 4210 call waiting switch problem,I have exchanged the phone four times. And I still can not switch to another line using call waiting switch.Customer support could not resolve the problem and recommended to return the phone to the store. Compared to my Panasonic 1000 this phone has very short operational distance. Walls are the killer of the reception (with Panasonic it is working just fine). The only positive experience I have with the phone is the sound quality. It is much better than Panasonic. I am very sorry about Siemens quality.
1,Poor Sound Quality,The design and look of the phone(s) are wonderful. The customer service people are very responsive and answered with no hold times....HOWEVER.... the phones had terrible static; probably interference from my router. I've returned them and am going to try the V-tech product.
2,Had to be returned,I had to return this phone because I could not answer an incoming call via call waiting. I called the manufacturer who had me go through several steps to fix the problem. These did not work and told me that my phone was defective and that I should return it to where it was purchased. This is the second Siemens phone that I have returned. The first one was the 2415 that had VERY poor sound quality.
2,Severely disappointed,"I was quite excited to finally see this phone on sale, so I bought it. I should have read the reviews first. The sound quality is horrible. It constantly clicks like someone is picking up another phone in the house. After 6 months, a majority of the buttons dont work. I have to push on them numerous times. The only good thing I can say is that the phone looks good and is comfortable in my hand."
5,wonderful,"~I think he is my most favourite doll than all other dolls purchased in Amazon - I think reason why is that he is rare as i could not find him at any stores, even toy store. I prefer to but in person as I want to see them in person but he comes in perfect condition!"
4,"Ken seems like an afterthought, but good overall","Bought this as a novel piece to add to my wife's collection. Great addition, we both love the books and movies. I like the Barbie better."
2,I just don't know dude...,... Barbie must be horribly lonely in her dream mansion with Ken running around in the woods like this.
5,excellent,"I finally received my Legolas and I was immediately blown away. I must say Mattel put great effort into making him look elvish and ethereal. He is simply beautiful.Ive already taken him out to examine him closely. His bow is beautiful. He has three arrows which will fall out of his quiver. I suggest you get him many more arrows to fill his quiver. His clothing is authentic to the movie. I do wish they had given him his knives though.His ears are perfect, they sit against his head well and do not stick out as Orlando Bloom's did. His body is partly a My Scene boy doll body, but the arms hands and legs are better sculpted and shorter than the my scene. My only complaint and not a serious one is that if you undo his braids you will realize his hair in front is much longer than the hair in the back. However clever styling will minimize that effect. All in all I love this doll. I give him a full five stars. Buy him! Buy two! you will love it."
5,Wow.,"I received Ken as Legolas for Christmas after I (on a whim) placed it on my Wish List. I have the first two Toy Biz action figures (blah, but cool) still in their boxes, but I never found the third so this was my ""replacement"" for not having the full three movie set. When I first saw it, I was floored. It's very well crafted, yet they could have spared a little of Ken's looks for some real authenticity from the movie. Despite that, the doll is amazing. I only removed him once to examine him closely and was amazed. The stand, for those who don't know, is behind the packaging slip (background) behind him. It's really cheesy from the looks of it (I didn't open it enough to find out.) The box is a much better display case for him. You can't complain; it's worth the money especially for a fan."
3,OK,"ANNE GEDDES BABY IS A SOFT, HUGABLE BEAN BAG DOLL WITH A CUTE, HAPPY FACE. WHEN I FIRST RECIVED IT, I HAD BEEN WANTING IT FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR AND COULD NOT WAIT TO OPEN IT. IT LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE BOX, BUT ONCE YOU OPEN IT, YOU REALISE THAT AROUND THE BELLY, IT IS ALL RINKLED WITCH COUSES IT TO BE FAT. IT IS NOT THAT FUN TO PLAY WITH :-)"
2,Not what I anticipated...,"Rayman Arena certainly isn't a game that deserves to be put up there with Super Smash Brothers Melee or any other fighting game for that matter. It's mediocre. That's the best way to put it. The first time I played it, it didn't exactly wow me...so I put it down and didn't play it for a while. After a few weeks, I decided to give it a second chance. Nope, nothing. The graphics aren't so good, and the game isn't fun either. They did try to make the game remotely interesting though...whatever....Not worth your hard-earned bucks. The only people I might possibly recommend this to are little kids, but don't expect them to play it for more than an hour."
4,useful for keeping track of scores!,"We always have trouble keeping up with who is ahead when playing as a group. This is useful, and helps us pick up the game where we left off for MARATHON settings. Would buy again."
2,Major Disappointment,"This book is a great, if you live in Asia or Europe.It's fair at best for the US.If you want books about about trees & shrubs of North America their are much better books you can buy."
5,Great Book,"I love this book, and as a horticulture student at Kansas State University, I think this book should replace some of our course books that we use. With it being only $20 it would save so much money for many students."
2,"Okay, but....","The preface was intriging. Couldn't wait until chapter 1. Blah! I didn't really care about his favorite fishing hole. Chapter 2 and beyond were better. Fortunately, the context of the book really was about power and the games people play to get and keep it, so you won't be disappointed in that area. The end of the book was an absolute let down. Anti-climatic. Dull. A cop out. I would've given it 4 stars but the ending killed it. The absolutely worst ending I've ever seen in a book."
4,My son goes to Elon!,"For a parent -- whose son goes to Elon University (Class of '08) -- this is a fascinating read. It should be very interesting (required reading?) for any private college administrator, potential student/parent, or major donor (it desperately needs to build endowment). Last year there were 9,000 applicants for a Freshman class of 1,200. Elon is indeed a former ""hidden gem"" college that has definitely ARRIVED!"
3,Good information,Keller's book is helpful for those who work in an academic setting. The principles learned and steps taken in this case study can also be instructive for anyone involved in any enterprise.
5,A Must Read!,"College Prowler's guide to SUNY Albany is unlike any other college guidebook on the market. The content and opinions in this book come straight from the mouths of students who actually attended SUNY Albany. The book covers a wide array of topics, from campus safety and security to academics, financial aid, what dorms to stay away from, what the guys and girls are like and if the atmosphere and weather of Albany are what you're looking for. This is perfect for parents, guidance counselors and for high school students who are looking to find the perfect place to spend their next four years."
3,Amusing fluff,"It's nice to have a cheeky-style self-help book. Tuttle's irreverence is refreshing and a couple of her lines made me laugh. Nonetheless, it's forgettable nonsense and at $14, a tad too expensive for what is offered the reader."
1,"because I WANT it, that's why!","How silly. WEll, anyway, getting what you want isn't always good for you. It's knowing the difference between what you need and what you want that makes you a responsible person, whether you are a man or a woman."
2,Not What I expected,"I bought this book, thinking it would be a little something to uplift my spirits on days when I was feeling down. I was a little disapointed to discover that the book is written as if the author wanted you to do some of the things she talks about. It does have some good points to it. It gives ideas on how to raise self-esteem and self image, but other then that, it is fairly shallow. So, if you are like me and just looking for something a little humorous, this one is too on the serious side."
2,Mindless not Funny,"This book has like 2 good tips, and they were about how to feel good or raise your self-esteem on one of those days when you're just ""blue."" The rest of this book, is just mindless. ""Uses for a pantyliner"" Who cares!?!? Will you even use these tips? I farely doubt it, and if you do, something is wrong with you. This book is intended to be funny, but is not. The suggestions about dating or guys is really dumb. If you can go to a local bookstore flip through it, but don't waste your money on it."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS U LIKE THROWING$$$ AWAY,"THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE! IT WAS SO STUPID, I CANNOT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME READING NOR MY MONEY BUYING IT. IT IS COMPLETELY IMMATURE AND RIDICULOUS. I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD PUBLISH THIS CRAP!"
1,A Waste of time and money,"This is the stupidist book I ever read. Not funny and a waste of money. Her other Bad girl book was just as stupid. I should have read the reviews before I bought them both. ""I was stupid""Not so again. I wish there was a ""0"" star rating...."
2,"Thin, very thin","If you're expecting usable tips about living la dolce vita, throw this book away and buy Swell, by Cynthia Rowley and Ilene Rosenzweig instead. Or, if you're broad-minded, try Shar Radnour's Femme's Guide to the Universe. If you want to wear panty-liners as a moustache, buy this book."
4,"I am woman, hear me roar!","Personally, I thought this book was really cute just from the little cartoon drawings, but the more I actually started reading it, the more funny (and in some instances, true) it became to me. ""Bad girls make it happen. A bad girl knows what she wants and how to get it. She makes her own rules, makes her own way, and makes no apologies. She knows when to work a room, when to work the angles, and when to work her curves-or do all of the above."" Topics range from Getting a Date to Getting a Life. Although it wouldn't really be possible to follow some of the suggestions in this book (i.e. ""Things to do with pantyliners: Add cushioning to any phone receiver for hours of pain-free shoulder cradling.""), unless your goal was to alienate your roommates and become a social outcast, it really makes you laugh nonetheless. However, the one message it doesn't fail to reiterate time and time again for all women is to be strong and be your own woman."
5,Fuuuunn and perfect for when you're in a bad mood!,"This book was incredibly spontaneous. It makes you laugh like crazy and you can actually take most of the advice given. No, the advice isn't spiritual or what it takes to be a woman.. it's just a lot of fun and it helps you bring the goodness and childhood out of you. You responsibly decide what advice you'd prefer to take [though A LOT tend to be very jokeful, and not actually serious]. It's a cute book you can read if you just need a getaway from actually being responsible and serious 24/7."
2,"A little too cheesy for ""bad girls"" over 12...","I'm all for the bad girl and girly books revolution, but this book was just a little too incoherent and meaningless for my taste. Basically, this book is a collection of useless, ridiculous lists of nothing, tips on how to accomplish nothing, and absolutely nothing that means anything (to me at least). Books I found much cuter and more appealing include 3 Skirts and The Go-Girl Guide -- both actually contain content."
4,Cute gift,I got this as a gift and I think it's so cute. not worth 15$ but so nice for a girl friend who is hard to shop for and and has a great love of life and adventure. You know the one that you just might get into trouble with .....
3,"Interesting, but not as good as being on the road...","Cameron Tuttle's _Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road_ was really an original book. Good advice combined with just the right amount of irreverence made it both practical and amusing. However, as its followup, _Getting What You Want_ falls flat. Tuttle tries to cover too many ""bad girl"" topics in one book; leaving the reader with a sense that depth is better than breadth. If Tuttle were to write a ""bad girl"" book based on something like work, or dating, or some other centralized theme, then I'd try her again. Generalizations about being a ""bad girl"" are no substitute for its predecessor."
2,funny but useless,"This ""Bad Girl's Guide"" book was just less than slightly entertaining - The title implies the book might be a helpful ""guide"", when in fact it is simply full of ridiculous lists. Some parts of the book were actually quite humorous, while the content was lacking - Just don't expect to get anything out of it except a couple of laughs."
3,Got Narrow Feet?,"If your feet are very narrow, then this is the shoe for you. Personally, again, had to have it stretched to fit comfortably. The space inbetween the straps across the front causes a little pinching when you walked.b Guess it will get better as the shoe breaks in.The sole makes a lot of noise too (don't try sneaking up on someone if you're wearing them).Oustide of my personal issues, it's a good, strong pair."
2,slowest write speed of any memory stick I've owned.,"DataStick Pro is great, but Sport is the slowest I've ever used. At first I thought it was defective, but if you watch the light, after you unmount (""safely remove"") it the light continues to blink until it's finally complete. My Centon DataStick Pro syncs my files very quickly but the rubber one takes forever to complete and you better let it or your files will be corrupt!"
1,Not Waterproof,I bought on to wear on chain it rusted up from body sweat. I over payed for the false claim of waterproof.
1,"Now it works, now it doesn't","Managed to use this stick for the first day, moving data between computers, and it locked up and never worked again. I have tried every fix I could find online, but to no avail. I don't recommend this product at all, as I've now seen dozens of similar reviews."
1,JUNK.....DO NOT BUY!!!!,"There used to be a ton of negative reviews for this item, but low and behold they are all gone. I'm going to make this short and sweet....AVOID THIS USB FLASH DRIVE!!!! Like other reviews before me I didn't listen because of the cool looking rugged factor of this device. Well, the ""wow"" factor goes away when you get your first ""USB device is not recognized"" pops up on your work or home PC. Lucky for me I heeded the reviews and didn't dump 32 gigs of sensitive material on this POS! It will work for about 2-3 months and then you will start to get the errors. You have been warned, and I would strongly suggest SanDisk or anyone else for that matter. I can't believe this company has the balls to ask the money that they are for this junk!!!!"
2,Bulky unreliable flash drive,"I bought this product around christmas from another seller and the first thing I noticed was that if there are two usb ports next to each other than its difficult to get another usb device plugged due to the bulk of this memory stick. Despite this, it worked fine for about 6 months, although with slow transfer rates, and then one day decided it didnt want to work anymore. I was led astray by the cheap price, but this is one of the instances where you are going to want to pay for quality."
2,Big but slow,"I have used this thumb drive on several Macs for a week, now, and aside from the slow speed it has stored data reliably. I have not tested the waterproof feature.My advice: buy another drive that's faster and just keep it out of the water."
1,Crap!,"I bought this model 2 months ago after having the 32gb drive for over 18 months. After using it maybe 3x it became unstable and I had to format it, which means I lost everything I copied over from my 32gb........... What a waste!"
2,Slowest USB stick I've owned,"The datastick sport is the slowest USB drive I've had. I bought the 64GB on a great deal because of the size and because the shock resistant aspect was attractive.It feels very resistant and I have dipped it in water and it worked well afterwards.However what makes this stick almost unusable is the write speed. I am using Ubuntu right now and started copying a few files (~5000 files) to my stick. Usually this wouldn't take too long but now the write speed is 200 kB/sec and it's been easily 5 minutes since I started. I also noticed that it was slow with Windows 7 but never measured it.Also, the stick is read only, I looked up online a few ways to change that but it seems that I would need to reformat it which I don't want to."
1,JUNK,Flash drive worked great for a couple weeks.. now all it does is show up for a few seconds and disappear..
1,Piece of junk! Buyer beware!,"This is piece of junk, plain and simple. The concept is great but the execution is poor. This USB drive failed on me after only 5 months of use. Lost everthing on it, or so I thought. Then magically it starts working again so I immediately dumped everything on it to my desktop. Then it stopped working again. I sent it back to Centon via RMA. Still waiting for a response. When it did work, the read/write speeds were not all that impressive. Also, the keychain ring is not attached to the actual USB drive, but rather the rubber case, so any snag and it will tear right off as mine did after the first few days. I replaced this drive with a Kingston DataLocker. That thing is bulletproof and it has encription. I won't be buying anything else from Centon any time soon."
5,Works great,"This works great and I have had no problems with it. In fact, I now have three of these sticks."
4,Centon DataStick,Not a bad jump drive. It does take longer to retrieve or save data thna the last jumpdrive I had (Another company).
4,Nice Little Ramstick,"Love the texture (easy to find in a pocket), the blue led is cute (but doesn't flash during IO, -1 star);not unreasonably priced."
1,Mine already died,"I hoped this would be a rugged flash drive, but it failed after a few months. I can't write more than 3 gigs now without getting CRC write errors--even after reformatting. I don't know about waterproof, but it's definitely not 4-months-of-time proof. Go with a better brand."
4,Works great,"The USB stick came pre-formatted as NTFS.If you have OS/X Snow Leopard NTFS is Read-only by default, unless you get a free app to remount the NTFS as read/write. For Lion though , it is read only. However, you can reformat it.The best option is to reformat using Disk Utility 'Erase' option, and select exFat. The is the successor to Fat32, and works equally well on Mac and Windows (Windows users may have to install the hot fix from Microsoft)Note : exFat is currently the best option for maximum speed and portability (unless you want to plug into a Router/DVD player,TV etc, and then neither NTFS or exFat will be suitable - you should format as Fat32 in this case, as exFat and NTFS are unsupported on such devices)Great for the price."
1,Dead Weight,"I purchased this drive about 3 months ago (Dec 07). It worked well up until about mid Feb 08, when it completely died. The properties says that it is 1.49TB in size (yes, tera), and that it needs to be formatted, but formatting attempts simply say that the drive is write protected. It will not show on WinExp, so it is worthless. One of my colleagues at work had the exact same thing happen to the same Centon product and another had a similar problem with a different Centon product. That is 0 for 3 that I know of. I would not recommend for purchase."
1,ticking time bomb,"I used this device only a few times during the first 6 months of its life. It worked fine. The rest of the time, it was in a drawer, safe and dry. Now out of the blue it has quit working. It says it is write protected, which is wrong (it doesn't support write protection). I can't read it, write to it, or format it. Low level formatting tools don't work on it. Win 7 disk manager can't access it. Nothing works. It's junk. Research on the web indicates that this is a common problem with this product: if it works at all, it doesn't work for long."
5,Data Stick Flash Drive,"This little stick was above and beyond what my grandson wanted from me for Christmas.Exactly as described, it is a performer."
1,F'ed up !!!!!!,"I was hoping they got better , nope, after I ordered it and read the reviews, I logged in and attempted to return it, The Amazon rep, whom i spoke with on chat . said it was a good product. What big BSer !!!! All the reviews I read were 1 star and basically negative reviews.I went to their website and it was not helpful at all, The drivers were updated (windows 89) and any drivers that did come with it was supposedly came with the Chip, A good product does not need to have drivers to run. your currently OS (winXP Win7) would be able to detect this.Stay away from Centon. Never AGAIN"
2,Slow,"I had the same problem with the write protect error that was mentioned by the other reviewers. After loading about 15gb onto the device it froze and game me the error. Centon sent me a replacement with no problem and the new one works fine. They seem to have a reliability problem with this product, but at least their customer service is good. However, this flash drive is very slow. It takes about 22 minutes to transfer a 6gb directory (720 music files), versus 16 minutes for my 16gb Corsair flash drive. Also, I paid $50 for this product, but the price seems to be higher now. I would stick with the 16gb Corsair, and if you really need this much storage you are probably better off with a portable hard drive which is much faster and probably more reliable."
1,Avoid this USB!,I bought this because it looked sturdy. I've had it less than 6 months and it totally wiped out. I don't even use it to store all my files. I use it 3 times a week to access power points. I can't believe I paid this much for something that doesn't even last for 1 year!
1,Mine died also,"I made the mistake of purchasing this flashdrive. It worked great for a few days, then in the middle of transfering data to the drive, it froze and is 100% dead. The data is lost.I agree with another reviewer that the rubber outside is great, but if the drive is going to fail, it is WORTHLESS. The whole point is to preserve the data."
5,Massive Flash Drive,"When I started using flash drives, I started with a 512kb. It's amazing how I can now tote around a 64GB flash drive, more space than my laptop! I love this drive because I can download whole software programs to it and lately, I've been working on a project that involved hundreds of pictures and I had no problem copying them. It's a plus that's waterproof although not a necessity for me. The only thing I have a comment about is the cap because it is not attached to the drive in any way so there is a possibility of forgetting it somewhere. I'm thinking of running a string to attach it to the ring that I hold my flash drives."
1,Write Protection,My datasport stick worked great for about a semester. Now I cannot place any new documents on the device nor remove any. I tried everything to remove the write protection but nothing has worked. I am very upset to have spent this kind of money on a USB and then not be able to use it.
3,"Might work, but feels cheap","Got this a while ago; backed my important data up on it (encrypted).However, I would NOT want it to fall in the water. It just doesn't feel like it's waterproof. I admit I haven't tested it, but I'd probably get a normal USB Stick and a waterproof container instead.I'm pretty sure it'd work for a while at least. But if the world was infested by zombies and this stick contained the cure, I would not try to swim across a river with it..."
1,Worst USB drive I have ever owned,"Purchased one on sale in June. The drive lost all data on 3 times before I emailed Centon. Received an RMA and sent the drive back. Received a replacement from the company. Plugged the new one in, added some files and then ejected it. Since then, no computer even sees it when I plug it in... All the hassle of sending it back, only to have it work for 15 minutes before dying. Do not buy this USB drive. You will regret it. Also, the rubber cover that attaches to the keyring it comes with just slides off the drive... I guess this way, when the drive falls out and you lose it, you still have the nifty sport cover on your keyring. What were they thinking?"
3,Good flashdrive with complaints,"I bought this flash drive to keep with me at all times around my neck. It is a good flash drive so far with no failures but my only complaint is the rubber sleeve does not hold the actual plastic flash drive tightly. I can easily pull out the actual flash drive by holding the usb connector and pulling with no effort. Also, the rubber cap falls off all the time i ""lost"" it 4 times and eerily found it each time even if it has been missing for 2 days. The rubber cap has a curse to come back to you which is great. I would give 5 stars if the usb drive did not come out of the rubber sleeve easily and if the rubber cap did not fall off by flicking it.One more thing. The metal clip that comes with it is garbage. It is a cheap piece of aluminum that broke 4 days after i started using it. I ended up making a necklace using twine."
4,Great jump drive,"Fast and easy to use, though a little bulky from the jacket. This drive can be rinsed off, though I have not submerged it yet. Four stars because the cap fell off when I was walking down the street one day."
1,AWFUL!,"I got this unit as a gift and I would have rather been given the German Measles. It has wasted time, money, and cds. Buy anything but this."
4,Works good for me!,"I just bought this unit a couple of days ago and so far it's great. I've recorder from all three available sources (i.e. Analog, optical digital and strait CD to CD copy), to 80 minute media, and they all sounded great on my car stereo.The only problem I've had is that when I tried playing the copied CDs in my DVD player I got a disk read error. However my DVD player is 3+ years old, so it may just be that it's not compatible with the silver bottom Music CD media I bought.Also it doesn't have the highest quality construction I've ever seen on a consumer electronics device (i.e. it's mostly plastic), but for what I paid for it I can't complain. :)Dan"
1,can i rate this with negative stars?,"This unit never worked. RCA is horrid to deal with. One year later, I still haven't seen my refund. I will never buy from this company again."
3,Everett Grist's Big Book of Marbles,"The book was complete concerning the marbles and marbles companies shown, but the book missed its mark by not going into greater depth and detail concerning the great variety of individual marbles. The book lists several prices of near mint marbles of various sizes but stops there. I would have liked to seen prices for the not so perfect marbles (different grades) and, in my opinion, should have been about twice as thick to cover photos and descriptions of a greater variety of marbles, not just submissions from his collector friends."
4,A Must For the Beginning Collector,"Grist has made it easy for young and old alike to discover the wonderful world of marble collecting--without getting taken to the cleaners. Not only does this volume throughly describe how to identify various marbles, it pictures many of the common marble varieties with very clear, full color, closeup photographs. Especially beneficial in identification is Grist's description of the manufacturing process which helps one understand why different marbles are marked the way they are and dispells a common myth that marbles must be perfect to be valuable. This volume did not earn a fifth star only because it seemed so short, but it is indeed a great addition to a collector's library."
4,Good marble identification book,"Excellent book for identification of marble types and values, and for general history of marble manufacture and select manufacturers. Grist details characteristics of marbles to identify the manufacturing method and general production dates, but you cannot identify marbles to manufacturer or more specific production dates by this book. Excellent pictures and selection of marbles. Overall, this is a good quality marble book."
2,Marble knowledge a must before starting,"I didn't find this book very helpful, you have to have a pretty good knowledge about your marbles and where they are made and stuff. Not a good reference book unless you already know what you have."
3,Marbles and more - pics galore,"Great pictures, and lots of them, with information on go-alongs and on manufacturers, but not a great an ID guide as I had hoped it would be. I still can't tell who made my vintage marbles."
1,Too dissonant for me,"I normally like songs with long drones. The first song was a bit dissonant, and actually put me to sleep. The second song woke me up and sounded awful. I won't listen to either again. I have better songs/backgrounds to put me asleep."
2,ONLY worked for my phone.,"There is no mention as to how this product works with dial-up. This is because the results may vary. My results? Nada. Zip. I get a dial tone, but nothing more. My phone works, sure. But I can't get on the Internet. I'm going back to my 50' phone cord draped across the living room floor because this puppy is GOING BACK."
2,Not worth the money,"I've owned this product for several weeks. The setup instructions weren't great, but I was able to figure out how to make it work. I've tried using it in several different rooms and have the same trouble in every room.. there's an annoying ""buzz"" for every phone I've tried with it. There are no suggestions in the booklet as to what might be wrong. Overall, I'm not impressed. I don't think it's worth the price. Consider your other options before you buy this one."
3,Vertical mount ONLY!,"I had intermittent connection problem at first when the transmitter unit was sitting level on a power strip. However, as soon as I plugged the transmitter vertically to the wall, the connection became stable. I figure this is due to when the unit is mounted vertically, the radio wave covers most of the floor. However, if it sits level, then the radio wave actually goes into the ceiling and the floor. After all, many antennas out there are directional!"
1,Does not work with Direct TV !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this thing because I needed a jack in my bedroom for Direct TV. it DOES NOT work with Direct TV!!! the package says it does but it does not.Its easier and cheaper to run wire and drill a hole or two if needed rather than fuss with this thing.Dont be fooled by this thing. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH DIRECT TV.
1,A couple of old misleading reviews,"The technical content no longer states that the device supports caller ID, so that review is obsolete.Note that the tech details also says that the two units are connected by Infrared (not RadioFreq, like a cordless phone, like I'd expect...).Be sure you can can return this unit! If you need high speed (modem) or caller ID, I'd go for a wired cable (I'm am an engineer... :-(... )."
1,Unreliable,"I'm on my 3rd one in about 5 years. They seem to just got out after a few months. One of the most frustrating and disappointing products I have ever run across. I hate to run a dedicated phone line for my Tivo, but it might be cheaper than this."
2,No substitute for wiring.,this product is a waste of time.. Just get the phone company out and do a better job.. I made the mistake of this purchase.. Dont you.
3,ok but a little aggravating!,This is great for what we bought it for but it was a little difficult to get working! We bought it for a set of medical scales that called the doctors office with vitals and it worked great for that but to use it as a phone jack causes slight static in the line.
1,junk-doa,"I really needed this to work, but i arrive dead. went for another brand-e. 2 Port DVI Video Splitter-from IOGear. works great.the iogear, also shipped with a dvi cable, this startech thing didn't."
3,DVI DISTRIBUTION AMP (ST122DVI),It took a little while to arrive but great service overall. The poduct did not do as much as I though it would. The LCD can only communicate through the first DVI output. The second port is just a dummy port which has no communication from the LCD. Anyway it's great if you just want to hook up two panels from your computer and not do to much swapping with different LCD's.
4,Superman Floor Mats,These floor mats were well made and looked very nice. They look and feel like they will last a long time on the floor of my sons' truck.
5,White Haired Sunrise,I love the music and songs Bunny Sings Wolf sings in her album White Haired Sunrise. Her voice is beautiful and the songs have such good meanings to them. I would surely buy more of her music.
3,A reader fom Maine,"This first book By Sheepshanks is not nearly as good as ""A Price for Everything."" I find the adultery too much; tasteless, and does not seem to ""fit"" in the story. I would, however, highly recommend ""A Price for Everything!"" I laughed out loud so much while I read that. It's good for your spirit."
4,Delightful doll - a family favorite,"We have three Geddes dolls, one for each of my three girls, and they are a marvelous toy. Although these dolls are fine enough for a collector's display (the clothes and the facial expressions are first-rate), they are durable enough to be a child's favorite, and ours are certainly well-loved. Just about every doll in the house has worn the sunflower hat at one time or another--if they are Very good."
5,Wonderful book!,"There are some terrific ideas in this book for how to make family time a priority and how to make memories for your children. The best thing about the book, however, is that it inspires you to brainstorm your own ideas, or tailor ideas from the book for your family."
3,Good Ideas... difficult format,"I found that this book gives lots of great ideas but i would have preferred to have them arranged in some type of age ranges. The book claims it intentionally arranged it without age ranges since each child is different. As a first time mom of an 11 mo. old. , many of the activities are for older kids. We can obviously do them later... but would like to be able to easily find those activities appropriate for his age."
4,A Joy to Read,Refreshingly unique stories told mostly from the perspective of Westward men in occasionally funny and frequently despairing situations. I have found a bright new voice in the sea of a too often mundane world of literature. I found it a joy to read.
5,"Gritty, true wit","One of the best story collections I've read. All the pieces fit--though some of them have been scattered quite far, Udall has confidently traipsed out to the edges and brought them back."
4,Great stories,"I loved all the stories in this book. I didn't know of its existence until I got a recommendation for it here on Amazon. The recommendation was because I had bought Udall's ""Miracle Life of Edgar Mint"". I loved that book, so I decided I wanted to read this short story collection as well. Udall does a wonderful job describing people and places, plus he has a great sense of humor (dark, yes, but brilliant)."
5,Brady Udall is great!,"Brady Udall's style of writing is, for me, as easy to consume as a hot cup of tea on a chilly morning. And it's just as soothing and enjoyable. His ""Miracle Life of Edgar Mint"" is a masterpiece, and ""Letting Loose"" is equally magnificent."
4,"Good Music, Wrong Song Order!","Ok.Simply listen to the track's and match up the CORRECT song's to the CORRECT title's. Because there are discrepiancie's.However, I am impressed with the quality overall, it's not high high definition, but it's ""ok"" for my sound system.I Used it on a windows XP home, Creative X-Fi Platinum. And Logitech Z-5500' Speakers.Please note, yes it's an awesome cd, but no, if your going to play it, understand the song's are SLIGHTLY out of order, bump the title's down a track or up to match it properly. Even the printed title's are ""mis labeled"". No kidding!"
3,2nd Tier needs work,"I got the stand because it was the best price for my buck. It is very solid and was painless to put together.The various height and width adjustments are good allowing use of many combinations of keyboards. You can adjust for a 61 key synth on top and put an 88 hammer key piano on bottom and it is still solid.The up down height and angle adjustment on the 2nd tier is good.Now the bad part.The 2nd tier is way off set toward the front of the stand. In the pic you can kind of get an idea, but in person is is very bad. This results in the top keyboard hanging way out over the bottom keyboard. You have to pick the angle up a lot just to see the controls on the bottom keyboard. I cannot find a workaround for this problem. The vertical post should be welded at the center of the tier or at least a closer offset."
5,Couldn't be any more solid,"These stands are great. I had one for about two years and just recently bought a second. No bad surprises with either. Just really rock solid, with plenty of adjustment options. I tend to play pretty rowdy and can't get any sway, even when going nuts with a synth on the top tier."
3,stand,"the stank is ok not a moble stand once up bascally ur gonna keep it there unless ur a backline crew, sometime unstable if ur using two keyz must place bottom on first or risk chance of tipping over other than that its an ok stand 2 and a half rating from me."
1,Be ready to take your chances,"I've bought a guitar stand and a mic stand from OnStage, and they have served me well. From the knobs to the legs, this stand is simple and reliable. The assembly was easy. Nice product. The only issue was that one of the top tubes of the z leg was warped, and so the 2nd tier couldn't fit in. It was an obvious defect that even my untrained eye noticed as soon as I took it out of the box. Shouldn't they check the parts before shipping them out? I wrote them a polite e-mail describing the problem two weeks ago, and I'm still waiting for a reply. I can't buy a replacement leg anywhere, so my 2nd tier isn't worth jack squat. This company doesn't have its act together. I'm not buying their products anymore. If you buy a stand from them, be ready to take your chances."
5,solid 2 tier,this product is constructed of heavy duty components. It is not that hard to assemble and is solid as it can be. Recommended 2-tier stand for all.
5,Solid stand,I've been using this stand to hold up my heavy Korg Triton as well as:[...]which is handles with no problem. Deff. recommend this stand for its stability and adjust-ability.
5,Stable and tough,This is a real heavy duty stand. On the bottom tier I have my Korg DSS-1 which is a mammoth instrument. Another overweight unit is on top and this stand is solid. No flex or wobble. Me likey!
3,Remember the drive in?,"This was the type of film you saw, with the very LURID exploitation adverts in the paper - and it lives up to the hype as to nudity and the Euro style of horror, and the cheese to go with it. If you remember going to the drive in each weekend to see these import films and running to the snack bar in between features - this will appeal, but for persons looking for a serious demon possession type film, nope -- Euro explotaiton at its top notch, just not more than that."
5,My favorite cookbook,"I've tried only about 10% of the recipes in this book, and all have astounded me and my lucky guests. My favorites have been the Sopa de Tortilla, the Sonoma Salad of Spinach, Carmelized Pecans and Warmed Goat Cheese, and the Grapefruit and Tequila Sorbet."
1,Don't purchase this item/ Wrong Grips,Don't Puchase this item!!! i just orderd this. i recived the wrong grips the seller said they made a mistake with the picture of the 1911 Diamond Hex grips. thats what i wanted. and got some wierd rubber Grips. i contacted the seller Who was very helpful and returned the item and he is fixing the problem said he will contact Amazon to change it. still pending and waiting for a refunds 2/3/09
5,Great Fit,"These were made for my 1911 along with the rosewood grips I added. My 1911 feels like it is part of my hand and my marksmanship has improved. Yes, I highly recommend these for comfort, fit and less fatigue when you do a lot of shooting as I do."
4,Nice addition to my ATI fullsize and arrived on time,nice addition to my 1911 and increased accuracy with a better feel. arrived in a timely manner and looked exactly as described... only issue which was no big deal was i had to trim on it a little bit to get correct fitment but like i said no big deal. for the price i would make this purchase again in the furture!
4,its a nice cheap add on for comfort without changing the entire look,fits alright a little thicker then i had hoped I would buy again though at the price I paid very speedy delivery.
4,Rubber Finger groove,"Fit perfect on my SpringField no problems, didn't effect my grips. My pistol feels much mor comfortable and more sturdy good stuff was kind off worry when I purchesed it but a great success exactly what I was looking for."
5,Awesome grip,"Put this grip on my springfield 1911, fit nicely, just needed a little trim on the edge to hide the rubber. It feels great in your hand. Can't wait to shoot it. Get it."
4,"Functionally great, but not show piece pretty","For the money these are a great addition to any 1911. They did require a little trimming which took about 30 seconds with an exacto knife. They are a nice soft rubber which feels great in the hand and when coupled with my Chip McCormick ""Slimline"" grips it came out to about the same width as standard grips without these inserts. The only real downside to them is the gap it leaves around the grip, or in my case with a stainless 1911 and wood grips you have a black line that's real noticeable. With a black frame you wouldn't see it."
2,PEARCE Ruber Grip,"You get what you pay for.on my 1911 government, it looks cheap and does not fit correctly.large gap between where the Grips and the rubber meet.The Rubber intrudes into the Magazine holder, restricting the magazine. Often an empty Mag will ""stick"" and not free release, as it should because of hanging up on the rubber. For this reason alone,I won't use this product."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,"These grips require just a small amount of trimming (best done off the gun). They look great on my Colt Gold Cup National Match. I used to use the big Hogue rubber finger groove grips, but now I can have the advantage of the rubber finger grooves with the nicer look of custom stocks on top of the Pearce Grips. Wish I would have thought of this a long time ago!"
5,Natural Aim,"I installed these on a comp Springfield Armory .45 I built and with a little trimming with a pair of scissors they fit great and make aiming second nature. Where I intend to shoot they naturally cause my sight to line up without thought. Look at your target, throw the gun up and BINGO...on target through ergonomics. Very comfortable and well made with just the right durometer rubber. Buy Two before the Dept. of Homeland Security buys them out. Oops...forgot...they use Plastic Fantastics. I'll stick with my all metal S.A. National match and Pearce finger groove Grips."
4,Ok for the price.,It was easy to instal but there is a gap between the finger grooves and my stock grips.Installed on a RIA M 1911-A1 FS
5,fit great,Fit and looks great. Helps greatly with control of gun. Any gun that I buy without grips I add these.
1,Game Froze On First Day - Still Can't Play,My son received this game for christmas and was only able to get about one hour's worth of play before it froze up. Now when he tries to run the game he only gets a black screen. The manufacturers have to realize that there are major problems with this game and should not be offering it for sale.
2,What happend?,"I was playing the game then it froze so I turned my DS off and then I couldn't play it again. There is nothing wrong with my DS, it's just the game."
5,And the oscar goe's to Age of Empires...,"PHENOMEM. JUST GREAT. MAN YOU CAN TRAIN ARMIES AND BUILD ALMOST EVERYTHING. THIS TIME, EVEN AN UNEVERSITY. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE GRAPHICS. THE GAMEPLAY IS GREAT AND SOUND IS AWESOME. OVERALL, THE BEST DS GAME.p.S.- TO MOTHERS, THIS GAME IS EDUCATIONAL!! iT'S ABOUT HISTORY HEROES. sTRATEGY. aLSO THERE IS A LIBRARY TO RESEARCH THINGS."
4,pretty good game,"I have found that age of empires ds is not quite as bad as people make it out to be. I have logged 17 hours with this game and although it has frozen twice(both non-lethal to game) that creating a username four characters or longer does indeed help. All that aside it is a really great game with plenty of units and excellent battle animations (though a little repetitive). This game recieves 4 stars because of glitches, but it is an overall good game. Although I wouldn't put this as number 1 on your must have list. It makes a good 2nd or 3rd!"
4,Fun portable version of Age of Empires,"I really like this game. Although it had to make compromises from the real time PC version, I think it's a nice compromise. The DS version keeps a lot of the same features of the PC version - like constructing buildings (including wonders), researching technology, and massing an army of different types of soldiers. I'm running through the campaigns which are enjoyable. Unlike the PC version, there are only five different cultures - Franks (French), Japanese, Mongols, Saracens and English. Wish there were more, or that they release another game with other cultures. It's a older game (2006), so the graphics aren't stunning, but the game play is easy and they have a tutorial to help you learn the ins and outs. You could play either using the stylus or just the buttons. I really like the strategy involved for the different scenarios. Overall, it is an enjoyable version of Age of Kings that is portable."
4,Not 2 Shabby...,"Well, I have been an Age of Empire player for years now. But since my kids have autism, I had to down grade to a portable system, and the DS has AOE. I have enjoyed the game definately! There have been some glitches! Well I have learned to save, especially while fighting against 3 AI. I tend to think it is the memory capabilities of the DS, or should I say uncapabilities? Anywho....so if you like these types of games, remember to save, save, save some more, and did I mention DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE AFTER EVERY BATTLE? For all of you who do not understand ""after every battle"", I mean after your turn is over....there was also an error message about taking out my game card and reinserting it. So, go ahead and do it. If you are patient and can save, it is not that big of a deal."
3,meh,"i didnt think this was very much fun from the start. there was no tutorial and the in game menus are sometimes a mystery. This game is slow even for a turn-based game. controls are spotty and counterintuitive, it just wasnt very engaging for me. dont base this game on past AOE games as it is a whole different ball-game. Battle scenes are pretty neat if not a bit confusing. try this game before you buy it! im glad i only paid what i did for it."
2,"Great Gameplay, but random lockups spoil the fun","I've been playing Age of Empires for a couple of weeks and have been largely impressed. The tutorial mode is good and the user interface is solid. Since people have covered the positives in glowing detail, I'll delve into the negatives a bit.GIven the small real estate available, the interface is good. It would be nice to be able to zoom in a bit in order to get better control over your units. It would also be nice to be able to rotate the map.My biggest gripe is the beta release quality. The game has locked up at least 10 times during play and about 3 times using the save and quit feature. Majesco's response to the latter problem is to save only, then power off. No solutions yet to the random lockup issue.I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this game. We can't exactly go out and patch the cart, now can we?It appears that Majesco is going to have to do the right thing and replace the bad cards with more stable code."
2,It was fun.....until it died...**SIX** different games,"So, I bought the game and played it for about 4 days and had a blast with it on a long car trip. Brought it home and the next day, it wouldn't restart. Just a black screen. So I took the game back. Since the retailer will replace the game, not refund it, I got GAME #2. GAME #2 played once, then wouldn't restart. Return--replace. GAME #3 played for about 10 minutes, restarted 3 times, then died. Return--replace. GAME #4 played 1 time, then wouldn't restart. By now, I have a clue, I did GAME #4 in the store. Replace. GAME #5 played for 5 minutes, then restarted 5 times. I went to the car, restarted it and black screen of death AGAIN. GAME #6 played once, wouldn't restart. The store had no more games, so the manager agreed to refund my money.Obviously, there is a problem."
3,Buy the PC version instead,"First of all, let me say that the PC version is amazing. Since it was so good on the PC I just had to get this version. But, this game has only 5 civlizations, is very slow going and it plays in turns! It does however have good picture and has cartoon battle scenes and works well. But, it takes so long to play the game that its not really fun. I know the PC version took a while to play but, it was fun building your nation and not like in this version where you move a few soliders and then have to wait for every one else to take there turn. If you get this game for your six year old he might like all the fighting scenes but he will probly get bored with the actual game.But, your six year old will probly like the PC version if you're ok with them playing a game with just a little blood in it. But if you're an adult you DEFINETLY should buy the PC version."
1,Great Game - when it works,"First I will say the gameplay is very addicting, but having to complete missions many times in order to move on because of the save game issue is very frustrating. I have given up on my second cart after experiencing the problems and reading all the reviews on here. I had the exact same issues everyone else did. This in my mind is a recall situation where the game is unplayable to some degree after a very short time playing it, you can't go any further in the game and cannot save any of your missions. Shame on the vendor for not recalling this great game."
5,A game for Risk lovers!,"If you like to play risk, you'll love to play this game. This is the perfect game to bring on a plane for a long trip."
4,Great Strategy Game for Nintendo DS,"Warning: The game is addictive.It is a very good game for a portable console. It might seem complicated when you just start playing, but as you play along it becomes easy to understand how to control an entire empire. Like any other strategy game as your empire progresses also your options grow and you have the power to construct bigger and more powerful armies and buildings.I like playing this game during flights as it passes time really fast and before you know it you arrive at your destination (and you can also eat your flight peanuts while playing your game, great fun!).Review from a 30 year old.With ""Age of Empires: The Age of Kings"" the world is mine..."
2,Fun,Fun turn based strategy game. I play it often. The optional objectives add a nice replay value. Feels like Age of Empires.
2,"If I could play it again, I might enjoy it more.","Like others who said their game locked up or would not restart, mine did after literally 4 days of ownership. I played the tutorial and got to the part of the siege of 3 Castles. While playing, it froze, but I was able to restart but after playing a few more minutes, trying to save and quit completedly killed the game.This game is not ready for live release, the code is unstable and far too many people have had broken cards.The use of the small screen and cramming layers of characters was nice, but in the beginning it was hard to navigate and figure out how to move the units around. Overall, the game play is nothing like the PC version and it does require much time to play.I may get another copy but something tells me I should look for another title to buy."
1,Majesco Should Be Tarred and Feathered,"An incredible game ruined by an incredible glitch. I thought the first one I bought was just a random dud, but the second one was just as bad. All the rumors about this game are true, and if you call the 1-800 number inside the instruction booklet for technical support, no one will answer. The phone just rings and rings. This was my favorite DS game of all time, until the earth caved in and sucked my cartridge into a black hole. Is anyone at Majesco paying attention to these complaints? I'm thirty bucks in the hole because some programmer fell asleep at the wheel. Is there a Majesco technician that can tell me how to get past the black screen on my game to fix my short login name? How about some practical help here, guys? Can you throw us a bone? At least let us know you're listening? Anything? Hello?"
2,Addicting by glitches are frustrating,"I've played the game a lot and hit several places where the system just froze up. I finally hit the black screen and cannot start the game any more. I just get a blank screen. This happens every time on both of the Nintendo DS's I have. After reading other reviews I realize I have a three character name and use ""save and quit"" a lot."
3,Great Game but Buggy,"I will keep this short as many of the other reviewers have said most of what I feel regarding the game's high level of entertainment. I want to make sure people are aware of the bugginess of this game, however; I already had one mission that did not complete due to goals not being checked as met. I have also had it happen that after a monk picked up a relic, along his way back to town, somehow the relic was lost on the map."
3,"great idea, poor followthrough","When I first heard that Age of Empires was coming out for Nintendo DS I was quite excited as I had played AOE 1 and 2 frequently on the computer. I bought the game and at once was pretty dissapointed.If you compare it to AOE for computer, its boring because its a turn based game. However if you like games like chess, checkers, and such games only computerized this game is for you. The graphics are actually quite good and this game really puts the strategy in ""strategy game"".One thing I disliked was some of the missions were nearly impossible to win. Because you couldn't raise your own troops like you can in AOE on computer, you are given a certain amount and you have to deal with the amount you are given (unless not in story mode). If you battle someone online or head to head its probably a lot more fun as its more similar to AOE for computer."
1,This game STINKS,"I thought that this game would be action-packed, but it turned out it was: boring, fast pace, and it just plain disappointed me."
4,One of my favorite DS games,When I was going to buy this game I had second thoughts about the game. Now I know I made a good choice. My friend and I always play hot seat game. I really like the variety of units you can play as. I also like it when you fight enemy units. This is without doubt one of my favorite DS games.
2,Froze up right away!,"I am the only girl I know who likes this game (other than my sister), and have played the computer game many times at friend's houses, and so my aunt gave it to me for my birthday, when I finally got around to playing it, it was an awesome game. I loved the easy to use controls and simple tutorial, but after only 2 days of playing, it froze up! When I clicked the game on my DS's menu, the entire screen would go black. I totally agree with whoever said that it wasn't ready to be released yet. I am definitely buying the computer game next time around."
2,It's okay.,"This game is okay. It's fun to unlock items, completing difficult maps, and learning about old heros. However, the game has some flaws.I've had this game for only 3 weeks, and the screen has frozen four times. If you buy this game, be aware of this and save often - It's not the DS's fault, try not to get frustrated with it. The graphics are fine, but could be better. The only thing different about this and the PC games, is that there are no custom maps."
5,Great for teaching moments,I love movies and so do the youth I know. There are some clips that can lead to discussion and help with remembering the talk. This compiles alot of ideas for easy use. This is a good series and I'm happy to use them.
2,Disappointed too!,"This was definately sparse on the recipes. It is very basic (and I was a bit surprised to see that in the publication info at the front of the book, it's also listed under ""juvenile literature""). There is good info on Vietnam, it's customs, people, etc., but a full half of the book concentrated on that and a few silly things like describing the term ""boil"". Definately not enough recipes. A grand total of 24 recipes, including how to cook rice and recipes for simple sauces. I'm disappointed with this (and the book ""Cooking the Thai Way"" which I ordered with it) but hate to return things so I'll just have to make the dozen or so recipes that interest me. Then get a nice, comprehensive Vietnamese cookbook where I can preview it before buying! This was my first online book purchase..."
2,just recipes please!,"This book is very disappointing! Very few recipes and a lot of pages wasted on things such as warning the reader to be careful while cooking. Is it really necessary to include a recipe on how to make steamed rice? This book also claimed to include vegetarian recipes, but very few were provided. Some of recipes look promissing, but really not worth buying because there are too few recipes and too many page fillers."
2,Disappointment!,"Just right after receiving the book, I took a look and was very disappointed immediately: ""Is this all ?""The book is thin and carry almost of half for unnessary general introduction. There are not much especial and interesting recipes which you can find from the other practical and attentive book .Perhaps because of the price so is that all we can get for what we pay?For really really really beginner that may work."
2,Missing Vietnams most famous recipes!,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject.However the recipes do not seem very representative, has a heap of random recipes (such as generic spring rolls) but completely overlooks Pho and Rice Paper Rolls, probably 2 of the more famous Vietnamese dishes.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
3,Review from the back yard,"Publishers Weekly says ""cliches, nostalgia, and overly sentimental yearnings?"" That makes me feel that the reviewer has either not yet gone through the death of someone close or did not have close friends while growing up. This book, like ""Be True to Your School"" is a little more special for me, because I live near Bexley and have lived in the Columbus area since my college days in the 60's. I've seen the places Greene talks about, and I remember many of the ones that are gone. Greene has a thoughtful, perceptive style of writing, making his books smooth and easy to read, even concerning difficult subjects. For those of us who were/are lucky enough to have long time friends or who have traveled that valley of the shadow of death with loved ones, this book is special and very well done. Good job, Greene. (Edit: I gave this book 5 stars, but for whatever reason, it is erroneously showing as 3 stars.)"
3,"If you've read Be True to Your School, read this too","Not for Bob Greene, but for Jack Roth. In Be True Your School, Greene's diary of 1964, he outlines the various misadventures of his best friends, who call themselves ABCDJ, (Allen, Bob, Dan, Chuck and Jack). This book tells some of how life has turned out for them (though it is deliberately vague about Greene himself) and is like catching up with old friends of your own. Greene's book is sentimental, and does hammer in some points a little too often, mostly about how the modern world doesn't have the same charms of their 1950's and 1960's childhood. It's still worth a read. Jack Roth was obviously a very nice man and Greene does his best to pay him tribute. The book is also a valuable reminder that nothing and no one is forever, and that your time with your friends should be cherished, as it may pass all too quickly."
5,A Memory Unforgettable,This is the most personally moving book about friendships that I have ever read.
1,Exploitative maundering,"this book is repetitious and boring. In an apparent effort to publish something--anything--Bob Greene exploits the final illness of a friend. The details of their youth in Ohio are pedestrian, and he offers no particular moral or spiritual insights."
5,Send This Baby to Your Buddies,Mr. Greene has written a terrific tribute to lifelong friendship. Jumping back and forth between how the ABCDJ group was during their youth and into the present in which they are all dealing with the deterioration and ultimate death of Jack is very effective. Mr. Greene attempts to convey the conflicting emotions that come with the death of an important element in his life. It made me appreciate how truly lucky I am to have similar relationships with my own group of five lifelong friends. This book is a keeper and I intend to give one copy to each of my four cronies.
5,I know this group....,"I am about 16 years younger than Bob Greene, I grew up in Arizona, and not in the mid-west, but I can really relate to this book. I too have four great friends that I am still close too, we have watched each other's back for over 30 years. We have stood by each other through thick and thin. Right now one of us is very ill, and I worry that I am going to live what Green when though all too soon.Good book, sad subject."
3,touching and tedious,"No doubt this is a touching book on friendship. Many times heart breaking. But, here also is the power of an author's name to sell books. The gripping story tends to make you overlook the tedious and verbose. Bob has a stunning reputation more worthy of the fast pace a suspense demands."
5,Another well received gift,"And You Know You Should Be Glad: A True Story of Lifelong Friendshipwas bought as a gift for the better half.She couldn't put it down until finished. Needless to say, she loved it."
5,Things We Said Today,"If you like Bob Greene and this book, seek out his book All Summer Long which is a fictional story of three men who take the summer off for one last vacation with no responsibilities just like back in the high school days. Even before reading You Know You Should Be Glad, it was obvious that the two friends in All Summer Long were based on Mr. Greene's real life friends and that the ""fictional"" childhood memories were inspired by real life and the places the men travel all come from Mr. Greene's experiences as a journalist. As I read You Know You Should Be Glad, I kept flashing back to All Summer Long and I had to sometimes remind myself that the new book was not fiction. It was touching to read about Jack Roth's death and also sad to know that Michael from All Summer Long has died too."
4,"Fabulous, but heavy!","The watch is fabulous, beautiful, and an eye catcher by all those who look upon it. It has served me faithfully for more than one year without trouble. However, it is the heaviest watch I have ever owned and does cause me discomfort after prolonged use, which causes me to give this watch a 4 out of 5 stars. However, a tightening of the watch band and limiting the time worn have both removed any discomfort I once had. Despite its weight, I am pleased and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,All scrunched together,"The information within this book is fine, but it's not organized very well making it difficult to find things. Yes, everthing is alphabetized, but there are sections that are so long they have their own, what I'll call ""sub-dictionaries"". So, if you're flipping through trying to find a word, you could get caught up looking through one of these sub-dictionaries and not even know it. Then, when you realize the problem, you don't know which sub-dictionary you're looking through so you don't immediately know if you need to fast forward through the book or flip to earlier pages. Then, once you do, you need to be sure you're not caught up in another sub-dictionary (like one for Vedic astrology, for example). This is an alphabetized dictionary, yet it still needs an index to find anything! Unfortunately, it doesn't have one."
1,VOIP Extension Jack,"I'm using the Netgear ethernet with our VOIP Packet 8 Virtual Office Phone as a wireless cable extension. What we needed was to have this phone ring into line 2 on our Uniden 2-Line, (since the Virtual Office doesn't come cordless). I was a little skeptical, but since the newly ""VOIP"" sticker was slapped on, I tried it. Doesn't work. But I saw another review (I think for an RCA phone jack) that mentioned PX-441, compatible with Data and Voice...so off I go to try that!"
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"This book started out good, but later on it becomes boring and unrealistic in everything except the emotions.I bought this book thinking it would be an interesting read but I was severly disapointed.The plot skips around a lot and the main character goes through some ""interesting"" fazes. (Kicking her husband out for not agreeing about cloneing, etc.)I would never recomend this book to ANYONE (strangers and enemies included)."
5,thought provoking,Angela Elwell Hunt effectively captures the emotions of each family member involved in this story that deals with the current controversial subject of cloning. Extremely well written. You won't be able to put it down. Fantastic!
2,"Nice, but totally flawed...","Yep it's a decent set for the money, but since the DTS decoding is flawed, I wouldn't bother if you enjoy DTS. How is it flawed, you may ask? Let me tell you. Play a movie with strong bass in it in Dolby 5.1, and then switch to DTS. Where did the bass go?You want an example? Try Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition. The part where Sauron gets killed at the start and there's this bass-heavy 'tidal-wave' across the soldiers. Lots of lovely bass in 5.1, and nothing in DTS. Useless. Same story with ALL DTS movies.You can do better.."
5,This system really rocks!!!,"This system is great! After spending a lot of time searching for a HT system, i found it. It's excelent. The set up was really easy and the sound is amazing. I live in Mexico and i have to pay taxes to import the system, but really worth it."
3,Good Product Poor Support,I purchased a RCA RT2500 and got it together. It seems to work fine. However the RCA customer service Department can't seem to find the remote codes for ECHOSTAR satellites and a DAEWOO DVD player. Without this the remote features are about worthless. A good product but not very complete when this small of an item can't be provided.I've worked with RCA Engineers for 25 years and this should be a small problem for them. Why Customer Service can't provide two simple codes is questionable.HerbH
5,""" What a system""","If you want a really good system and you don't wanna pay a lot, this is the system to go with. I have become a ""Home theater fanatic"" and just cant get enough of this system. For once in my life I'd rather stay at home and watch a movie, as opposed to going out to the movies.I checked out several other systems in comparison with the RCA RT-2500 and none of them compared to this one.The subwoofer lacks bass power, but that you can always replace with another subwoofer."
3,Western State,"This book is interesting and informative, but the lack of good editing might be distracting to some readers."
3,7 Step Diabetes Plan,Bought this book for both us to read as one was recently diagnosed as borderline diabetic. Book provided good general info on topic
1,Very bad advice,"This authors advises to feed dogs some toxic foods, such as raisons and garlic.You should not follow this books advice."
5,This is a keeperI really liked it!,"Kassia Finn got fired Because Lyon Mulholland got the wrong end of the horse. and she had to pay for someone elses mistakes.When Lyon realized the gross mistake he made, he went to Kassia to try to make amends. One thing lead to another and the next thing was Lyon was trying to get Kassia to bed. When he discovered she was a virgin he became deterimined to wed her.His love for Kassie became almost an obsession, and he didn't like it.When Kassia realize she loved Lyon she tried to avoid him, but she longed to be with him. She was very mixed up.I like Susan Fox, Rebecca Winters Eva Rutland, the late great Betty Neels, and the late Essie Summers."
2,don't waste your money !!!!!,I was so disapointed in this game I love rollercoaster tycoon for the computer. I thought this game would be like that but it's like the cheap made version. don't waste your money on this..
4,WALL TILES,easy to use with plenty of tiles per box. I like the adhesive tape which holds well. put up around my stove for looks and cleaning. I use some spray cleaner and the splatter wipes off instead of soaking into the paint. be sure to clean the walls well before putting up tiles. brightens up the kitchen.
1,DOESN'T STICK,"These look ok. money down the drain. I'm trying to stick them in my kitchen right now, and they keep falling off. Way too much of a hassle. If you buy these, i recommend buying different kind of sticky tape for the back. If you don't line them up right, it throws all the other tiles off."
5,work perfectly,I bought these to use as a back splash in our rv. I used some adhesive that will tolerate cold and warm temperatures. There were a few pieces that needed trimming. It was easy to do with just sturdy scissors. They look great.
4,very good tile,It looked pretty nice in my kitchen. I used double side tape as others recommended and not a single piece is loose.It is a little bit difficult to do the cut pieces though.
4,Super cool and inexpensive way to upgrade your walls,"I purchased the aluminum squares and triangles for a backsplash in my kitchen. I read the other reviews about adding some glue or mortar in addition to the adhesive tabs as backup and ended up putting a drop of Krazy Glue on every tile just to be on the safe side. I'll re-write this review if I hear the tiles popping off in the night.I also agree with the reviews that, while the tiles are thin and easy to cut with kitchen scissors, the edges are incredibly sharp. I ended up with numerous slices on nearly every one of my fingers merely from holding the edges while trying to maneuver the tiles into place. Finger slices from metal are no fun, so use caution--or maybe even wear thin latex gloves when putting these up (though it's possible the metal will cut through those, too).All-in-all, this was an extremely easy project, with some extra time needed to cut tiles to fit into corners or awkward spaces. Highly recommended!"
4,"Looks great, but doesn't stick with provided stickies","These tiles look really great, but unlike other reviewers, I had a problem getting them to stick. They come with double sided sticky squares which are easy to use, but the tiles started loosening/lifting after just one day. Per some of the other reviews, I just purchased some liquid nails and hope that will do the trick. They seem to be easy to clean which is a plus in the kitchen. Just need to solve the sticking problem, and I'll be all set!"
4,Great Look,"I love the way my kitchen backsplash looks with these. Very easy to cut. I was not able to see the VERY subtle grain of the tiles until they were on the wall, so mine are random, but still looks nice. I live in an older house, so nothing is square. This means I need some type of trim for where the tile meets the kitchen counter. Still trying to figure this out. Also, it would be nice to have a corner trim and an edge trim. It did take longer than I expected to install, but that was because I only had one row of whole tiles and had to cut for above and below. I only used the adhesive supplied, and have had to go back on some of the tiles and add additional adhesive. Overall, I recommend this product and am quite pleased with the results."
5,Aluminum wall tiles,These tiles installed very easy. They also cut well with a regular scissor for fitting. I used them around a stainless steel laundry tub and are an excellent product for that purpose. They wipe clean with ease. Years ago I had installed them behind a kitchen stove and they looked good and lasted years for that purpose. My personal taste is to install them in a checker board design and they work well that way or in the diamond shape as shown.
1,Shameless Rip-Off!,"I've read all 6 books in this series, in order. They're all nice cozies, and easy to read. I'd give this book at least 4 stars too, if it weren't for the fact that the plot in this one is a shameless rip-off of Agatha Christie's ""They Do It With Mirrors"".If it were only how the murder was done, it could just be coincidence -- two creative minds getting the same idea. But the entire setup is the same -- a large number of buildings for a group of resident teenagers with problems, one of the spouses using too much of the other one's money to keep the place going, a problem teenager with a parent fixation, and on and on.Did the author and the editors really think that readers today aren't familiar with Agatha Christie's books?"
1,The art of dreaming... nightmares,When I opened the packadge i was disappointed to see that the last 30 pages where missing the last lines of text. So I will send back this peace of crap I bought from amazon and probably never buy anything else from them again.
1,Hugely overrated.....,"When I bought this book, I was fully aware that it is a fiction, but I still hoped for some kind of amazing revelation, etc....because I have read so much about Carlos Castaneda and his ""ground- breaking"" books. All reviews cry about how brilliant this book is, and this and that... and IT IS NOTHING OF A SORT! It is hugely OVERRATED! It is a not a bad fiction from a writer, who knows his craft, but there is nothing either ground-breaking or credible about this book."
4,Dreaming truly is an art...,"Castaneda has shared again the Don's teachings, this time on the dream realm. Other than a dream guide, it is an unusual journey, and reveals a path for shamanic dreaming. This book could put you to sleep - if you want to test his words."
5,a book of strange genius,"I was of the opinion that Castaneda probably made this stuff up, but I read all his books anyway because they are so entertaining, deep and haunting and I agree with the basic philosophy that this world of ours is basically a shared interpretation of energy. Then I had a series of dreams. I sure don't think he made the stuff up now. Thanks, Carlos, for opening the door and describing reality in a way I had only partially suspected before."
3,interesting but misses the mark,"A book that I sometimes had to push myself to finish. Interesting subject matter, that does make you explore your own ideas about reality, but sadly seems to leave the reader dangling. I went from feeling that he is almost hitting on some great ""truth"" to thinking that this is just poor fiction. I am left with mixed reviews."
4,Delve Deep into your psyche to find answers,"This book in 'The Teachings of Don Juan' series is all about dreaming, lucid dreaming, traveling to other realms and meeting non-corporal beings using your dreams as a key. It's about finding the keys to your inner self, your inner power, and unlocking your potential to find the answers you need to know in your life.Like all the 'Don Juan' books this isn't so much a how-to manual like many books on magic are. Rather, this is a story about one man and one teacher and thier experiences together. There is much to learn here, but individuals may have different experiences with some of the methods than Carlos Castenada had. A good book to read if you are working on unlocking the power of your dreams."
3,"good fiction, with limited amount of Don Juan's teachings.","This book is obviously fictional, but a good story. It includes a few actual methods for creating and controlling dreams, but is by no means a good instructional manual on the subject."
5,Buy it,"Buy this book, RIGHT NOW. After you buy it, go buy THE Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. Then go buy whatever looks good after that. These books are ESSENTIAL. I NEED CAPS TO EMPHASIS THIS!!!"
4,Great Reading,The Art of Dreaming describes the steps needed to master control and consciousness of our dreams. In this book Castaneda describes extensively how our state of awareness can be achieved by means of dreaming. I have read most of Carlos Castaneda's books and I found this one to be one of his best. A must read for any of Castaneda's fans.
1,Useless bunwarmer,"Bunwarmer??? Don't think so. Also, bunwarmer lid keeps falling off. I have laid it to rest in storage until I get it to the goodwill charity."
3,so-so,I had this grill for over a year. Here are the pro's and con'sPros-Good Size-CheapCons-Bun warmer lid doesnt stay latched-Non-stick coating starts coming off after a few months-No temperature controlAll in all a good product but could be much better.
3,Bun Warmer Lid Broken,"I love this grill, but after a few uses the bun warmer lid broke off. Oh well, the bun warmer wasn't very useful anyway. The rest of grill works great."
4,Great purchase,Beautiful...it is just as it was described. This was very affordable and my husband really loved it.
4,cheap drawer,"The case is nicely completed, but the drawer has no guides and cheapens the case. The compartments are too small for my bigger (42mm+) watches! Also it has no lock which is not a problem for me...another key I don't have to keep up with and allows for quick swaping of the watch I want to wear each morning!Still for the discounted price it is well worth the money!! I would NEVER pay retail for this product..."
5,Great storage box for your watches!,"Beautiful box to hold most of my watches. Have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings. This box holds those watches in less space! Having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion. Nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance! Another 10 in the drawer below. If you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking, good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item!"
3,watch box,"I ordered this as a gift, I recieved my item within a week. It's a great box, however it is no where near the color i expected. It is a whole lot lighter the the color you see."
2,Nice looking,"It looks very nice. It came broken. The latch is missing a screw which doesn't make me happy. I also thing that the slots are not big enough. As a male, a lot of my watches are very large sport watches and some are wider than the slots. It is still workable, just looks a little strange."
5,"Boy, can he play!",We really enjoy listening to Joe Bonamassa. Saw this first on PBS and just had to stop what we were doing and watch and listen. Bought this copy to give as a gift.
4,Great video,"Joe Bonamassa does it again with another great performance. Good video, good sound and stage camera work. I'd recommend this."
4,Joe is the Bomb!,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that we also bought Joe at Royal Albert Hall, which I would give 5 stars. His voice and guitar playing leaves no doubt he's the best. No wonder he opened for BB King twenty years ago."
5,Joe Does It Again,"I watched about an hour of this on WTTW Channel 11 the other night and was floored. The sound, editing, band, everyone is STELLAR. I had pre ordered this right away as Joe can do no wrong in my book...another great release, and from the Blu Ray track list much different set list than Royal Albert as this release coincides with Dust Bowl. Beth Hart, John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers each guest on 2 tracks apiece. Amazing concert. Enjoy!"
3,You have to appreciate musical fusion,"Joe is a talented guitarist and if you like musical fusion, then Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theatre is for you. The reason I purchased this DVD was because I really liked his CD with Beth Hart, but had I realized his solo performances combined so many styles of music, I wouldn't have bought it. He's obviously good on each song, but his music wasn't distinct enough for my untrained ear to fully appreciate."
5,Bonamassa Blazes at the Beacon,"If you know who Joe Bonamassa is, you need to add this DVD to your collection...if you DON'T know who Joe Bonamassa is but love GREAT guitar, you need to add this DVD to your collection. I have a copy of every CD & DVD this guy has put out so far and this is one of the BEST he has done to date. He absolutely shreds every guitar his crew puts in his hands...and there are several! Plus his vocals are REALLY good!BONAMASSA BLAZES at the BEACON!!!"
5,Joe does it again,This DVD has to be Joe B's best DVD to date (Even more spectacular than the Royal Albert Hall and BCC's Live over Europe) with a special cameo from Beth Hart (one of my favorite Bonamassa records) this Blu Ray/DVD is easily worth the $20.00 for admission.
3,recorded?,Joe is very talented.Love his music .have every album he has out.This record is wonderful except for the way it was recorded.Sounds to me like its analog.Very dissapointed.By now he should also be concentrating on the quality of his music.I love it when a record has a professional sound. Please JOE DO IT RIGHT.
2,Not quite the Albert Hall,"Not quite up to the Albert Hall. Didn't care for his guest's that he brought on stage. Didn't have half as many favorite tracks as on the Hall DVD. I miss the dual drummers they are a better fit than Tal he is to much glitz style of "" Metal Drummers "" and doesn't fit Joe's style. I think Joe tried something to be a little different than his Great Usual Style and it fell short of my satisfaction. But Joe as we Old guys say Keep on Keepin on, Love to hear those Fender's wail !!"
5,Absolute Awesomeness !!! 6 Stars !!!,"As a blues fan of the new generation, i had listen to a few songs and heard about Joe Bonamassa on the radio here and there.But after seeing him on a PBS special on a late Saturday spring night,i became an instant fan !!!This guy is a GUITAR GOD ! He's way up there with all the greatest like SRV,Clapton,Hendrix,Page,Townshend or whoever you may think of.Joe Bonamassa is definetely one of the greatest guitar player of all time no doubt about it.His fingers are just like magic,not to mention his voice.I can only imagine how it youl'd be to see and ear him play his stuff on a Stratocaster...I still can't get over this concert as i was blown away big time by the sheer performance.Just the extras are worth the price.I mean WOW !!!A jaw dropping piece of antologie.I dont know what to say more !A must see,must ear,must have !"
4,Worth having both,"I'd rate this performance 95, and the Albert Hall performance 105. For the price it's worth having both. If you're just going to buy one, buy the Albert Hall performance. Regardless, this guy is really really good. Next best thing to seeing him live - maybe even better."
5,"Blues, blues and blues!","what a performance, surely he is a top guitarist and yet so young! The whole band is tributng on this DVD, for he coeuld not do it aloone. If you like blues, than you must have it!"
5,STUNNING!,"It is a real shame that the ""mainstream music"" stream is dominated by generic AOR where folks like the Jonas Brothers and whatever manufactured group-of-the-day ""band"" are viewed as ""musicians"" I have played the guitar for about 30 years all around the world and can't listen to the ""Mix/Hot/Hits"" radio stations anymore due to the lack of innovation, overuse of sampling and copycat lyrics. Joe Bonamassa blows every other guitar player out there today away. This DVD was my real intro to Joe and I am now hooked. I can't wait to see him when he comes to DC this fall. Buy this DVD and you will NOT be disappointed."
1,The Worst Soccer Game in history,"Menu: turn you insane, because the cursor goes down and up flashing and clicking without stop and that's sucks. so stupid thing that I ever saw.I can't understand what Ea sports designers tried to do. but for sure they still missing the point that is ''Having fun''if you survive to the Hysterical and crazy menu, then you gonna see that graphics are not goog at all. faces are washed out, same thing with the kits. And they insist with the MLS league. Come on!!! Who cares Kansas City or Chicago Fire!Golies have much to improve, in fact all the game have to improve but I don't think easports people care.Please don't waste your time with fifa'06"
3,Low Quality Disks,"I purchased this game and it would not even install, reporting a missing file on disk 2. I guess they do not quality control their game CD's such that it is hit or miss as to whether or not the game will install for you. Since they did not respond to my tech support request emails, I just borrowed a known good copy and installed it using my CD key.Due to a broken arm ( from yesterdays real-life soccer match ), I'll keep this short. It is hard to control unless you purchase a game pad, difficulty is high, but at least the graphics are good.On the positive side, it works well under Linux using Cedega application.Don't buy this unless you really just have to have a soccer game."
2,EA Keeps Missing the Point - do they read reviews?,"I agree with all the people who criticized this game here. This game is terrible. The manager feature is an excellent idea only to be ruined by the games playability. The graphics are ok; when you see the player faces upclose, they're actually pretty scary. I really don't think that EA have been reading their FIFA soccer reviews from prior game releases or they're just ignoring them. They should stop the graphics development and concentrate on the game itself."
1,Way!!! too expensive,Take heed to the other reviews. This item is outrageously over-priced!!! While the construction may be exceptional you will get no more benefit from this cable than from a standard IEEE1394 cable which costs about 1/4 of the price! I use the freebie cord which came with my firewire card and it works perfectly every time. (by the way this cable costs more than my firewire card and cable put together...)
3,Hazy Skies and Mild,"The Search for Sonny Skies is a novel where the readin' is easy. The Richards character is a sleezeball with a heart of gold.. Sonny Skies is a sympathetic, mentall,y traumatized former movie star. He thinks he's only eight years old. He's supposed to have died in World War II combat fifty years ago. The movie giants of those days knew how to make things happen or not happen. Mickey Rooney makes it all happen in his own burlesque and vaudeville way."
2,How to Install and Use Nitrous Oxide,"I bought this book before I purchased a NOS system. I was hoping to have a clear idea of what I was about to get into. The book answered all of my questions about Nitrous itself and how it worked, but failed to answer most of my installation questions that pertained to my Super Powershot Plate System. There were no pictures or drawings of a QJet and plate system installed. Mine is the most basic system there is. There were, however, many pictures of the more advanced systems available. The author must have been interested in filling pages because I read many paragraphs over and over throughout the book. It started to become very annoying. It did include some interesting charts and results of before and after Nitrous installations. I told my local Corvette speed shop guy that I had ordered the book and he asked, ""Why?"" He found it useless. Overall, I found the book ok. I don't regret buying it, just read the manual that comes with the kit as well as this book!"
2,Don't bother with this book!,"While knowledgable about high performance engines I am naive with respect to nitrous oxide use. This winter I will be installing a nitrous system on my supercharged '95 Camaro Z-28. The book was purchased to help me increase my general knowledge of automotive nitrous oxide systems.Overall I was quite disappointed. The amount of information contained is fair, at best. The writing style is also lacking. Passive voice is used frequently and it is often hard to simply understand what the author is writing about, let alone gain useful information. The book does, however, contain some useful tidbits and engineering formulas. These are poorly explained though and I am not 100% confident that they are accurate.I suggest you look elsewhere for a source of information on automotive use of nitrous oxide."
2,NITROUS ?,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY VERY BORING AND DID NOT COVER THE STEP BY STEP INSTALLATION OF NITROUS FOR A NOVICE. IT CLAIMED THAT NITROUS WAS CHEAPEST H.P. PER DOLLAR BUT I HEAR STORIES ABOUT BLOWN MOTORS, ETC. IF THE FUEL LEANS OUT ETC. OVERALL I'LL PROBABLY GIVE THIS BOOK AWAY EVEN IF I PURCHASE NITROUS!"
3,Good; yet...,"Yes this is a good compilation. What would have made it ideal is the long and better version of ""Love is a Battlefield"". To cut it off at around four minutes does no one any good. Would it have hurt them to include the longer version? And is that really Bryan Ferry doing the whistling?"
4,When is EMI Records going to give us Pat Benatar fans our cake and let us eat it too?,"This is the most comprehensive collection of Pat Benatar's ""best of"" packages. It has 33 songs and a great song selection. I was very happy to see it in the store and I decided to buy it as soon I a saw the amount and quality of song titles. Unfortunately, it includes the single versions of many songs. These single cuts fade away early and not very gracefully.When is EMI Records going to give us Pat Benatar fans our cake and let us eat it too? I would love to see a CD with all the songs that are on ""All Fired Up!"", the sound quality of the remastered ""Greatest Hits"", and album versions the way ""Best Shots!"" offers."
2,Cheap but don't bother,"I made an assumption about the '3 + 3' meaning this included the filters - they are not included. Additionally, the opening to the bag is not even cut out. I fortunately found this out before I made too big of a mess inside my irreplaceable Eureka. Understand they are cheap, doesn't mean they have to be defective...."
5,The best book for the befuddled.,"I keep this book around to loan to new computer users - those who are befuddled by the plethora of jargon, buzz words, and tech-speak that everyone ELSE seems to understand. This volume gives basic introductions to PC's, Macs, any peripheral you care to name, the current major operating systems and how to get around in them, and a beginers guide to the internet. Definately a best buy."
5,Too simplistic.,"Seemed to sacrifice text and depth for graphics. Gives a definition of terms, but not an explanation of what the terms actually are. The definitions often leave you with more questions."
5,'A Religion for the New Millenium',"This book explains in a clear, informative style why pantheism is a workable, honest, and appropriate philosophy and way of life for our times. There is a World Pantheist Movement abroad, and Carl Sagan would, I'm sure, have been glad of it."
1,not reliable,"I purchased the 4215 phone and one extra receiver 4200. I liked it very much but only when it actually worked. The LCD on 4215 broke after only 2 or 3 weeks of using it and the charger on 4200 stopped recharging TWICE. After exchanging the phones twice I am returning the whole system to the store. I called Siemens to get a new charger but was told they are ""out of them"". hmmm... I wonder why..."
1,Don't buy these phones...if there's wireless anywhere near,"I have a set of three of these phones (my mistake to buy all at once). They have had problems from Day One. I have had to return them to Siemens -- only to get the same problems back. None of their recommended fixes have worked. And worst of all, customer support has been atrocious. I recommend not buying these. I bought two other 2.4 Ghz phones from AT&T, and they have been flawless in the exact same environment."
4,Searching for a Base to Belong to Us,"It's a beautiful, intuitive device. But alas, this supplementary handset can't find home--unless you read the instructions that come included with the phone--place it in the cradle, turn it off, and it will register itself. I had purchased a 4215-which by the way, works flawlessly. Every feature is amazing, including the unmentioned Evening Settings, which allows you to set a volume level for a predetermined time period. Even the voice dialing works as advertised (which is a one-key operation, if you read the manual). And finally, a date and time on the phone display...why every device in the world doesn't have this feature, I can't guess..."
2,Nice Looking!! But thats about it!!!,"Battery life is too tempermentel, but on the average around 30 hours (handbook states 6 days, yeah right). Not normally a problem unless you leave for a couple of days and you forget to put it on the charger. Remember that the answering machine is built into the handset. SO, if it runs out of juice then the answering machine never kicks on. I have had the phone on several occasions run out of juice on just the average 8 hour workday. Who knows what messages i missed. It also has no plain ring tone. Opera sounds, but no basic plain chime.Some of the other fancier feature are nice like speaker phone and room monitor. The basics are lacking so i cannot in good mind recommend this phone."
3,Caller ID 2.5,"I was a former developer of this product line. The development was moved from the USA to Germany. As far as the term ""Caller ID 2.5"", in order to enable the feature, you need to ask for ""Caller ID Deluxe"" service with the phone companies.Caller ID 2.5 is a compromise between 2.0 and 3.0. Since the phone didn't have the display required for 3.0, the feature was implemented in the buttons on the 8825 base and the menus of the handsets like in other Caller ID boxes, but it is not a standard term recognized by phone companies.I purchased the phone for its speakerphone capabilities."
1,Not correct fit,"Don't trust the fit guide! This will not fit a BMW 540i. I ordered one of these a while ago and waited longer than 30 days to put it on the car so I couldn't return it when I discovered that it was the wrong part. I figured it had been labeled incorrectly so I ordered another. Sure enough, it's the wrong part. Luckily, Amazon will pay for return shipping."
5,"For fans of Maroger's medium, this book is a must have!","The artist and author Joseph Sheppard studied for 15 years under Jacques Maroger who ""discovered"" the lost medium of the old masters and by whom the famed Maroger medium is named after. Sheppard learned how to cook the famed medium directly from Maroger himself, and in the book the formula for the medium he gives is an ""improved"" version of Maroger's (which he calls his ""Basic Medium""). The book gives detailed instructions on how to make this fabled medium and its different iterations. So if you're a fan of Maroger's medium and would like to learn how to make the medium yourself, this book is truly worthwhile getting. I give this book five stars if only for the formula of Mr. Sheppard's version of Maroger's medium and, although I'm not a big fan of his artwork, for the excellent step-by-step painting demonstrations which are well illustrated."
3,the masters painted more than just the figure,"I purchased this book looking for more information on the painting techniques of the older masters. Mr. sheppard certainly has some interesting knowledge, however the book contains only figurative work, so if you are looking for a more expansive application of the techniques of the masters this book may not be for you. Although informative I still found much of the depth and genius of the likes of rembrandt, goya and titian much better instructors about the art of painting. What mr. sheppard does do is show one how to apply certain mediums in an old world way. For those who dont want to make their own maroger medium try some of the big name art supply houses. Then get Max Doeners book on artists materials and go to a great museum; you will have a much better source than this good but schloky introduction to the old masters."
3,Good Book - Not for beginners,"First off, this is a good book - but if you're painting for the1st time, try some other subjects first. I don't recommend thisfor the beginners.Don't expect to paint like DaVinci your 1st week.Even if a seasoned veteran understand this takes practice.I would have liked to seem more techniques on how he painted.The materials used area was very good and quite interesting.If you're a seasoned painter, who wants to paint like theydid in the days of old, I highly recommend this book.Trying these techniques gave me even a larger respect for ""the old masters"". I always loved their art, because it takes youback to a time where really good art required really good talent & skill.Practice & maybe we'll see your ""Mona Lisa"". Good luck!"
4,How to Paint like the old masters,"I was very impressed with the speedy delivery and the excellent condition the books arrived in. They arrived promptly and to my door by delivery van. I was also very impressed with the low prices. I found purchasing through Amazon, an amazing experience and one that I will definitely repeat. Thank you Amazon."
4,PAINT LIKE OLD MASTERS,INFORMATION IN BOOK VERY USEFUL AND INFORMATIVEWOULD RECOMMEND MOSTLY FOR ADVANCED ARTISTS OR DEDICATED AMATEURS
2,Not so sure,"Sorry, but I think the quality of the artwork by the author is not very good. Maybe his advice is rock solid, I'm not saying it isn't, but I can't get past the artwork to take the advice seriously. I have that problem with many art books."
2,same old stuff,All the projects looked the same. it didn't go into a detailed description of the the techniques the different artists used.
2,Realistic painting for the beginners,"I beg to defer from the other reviews. Having bought the book on the basis of the reviews, I am quite disappointed. This is book IS for beginners who are interested in the first steps of realistic painting. It takes you through various Old Masters' techniques (or rather what the author THINKS is the Old Master's technique) without much explanation. The author's comments, as he takes you through a handful of development snaps of his painting, are scanty and non-helpful. Don't dream that you could paint like anything vaguely like the Masters; and in fact, the authors own painting is a poor, if any, semblance of a Master's work unless you are looking through the eyes of a beginner.The most interesting part of the book is the four stages on the cover, which is probably enough information without having to buy the book."
1,You can do much better,That aluminum woman on the front cover is ludicrous. What makes the author think any old master ever began that way?You will do better if you look for a book by a painter whose own work does not appear amateurish.
3,This is NOT the Old Masters,"Sheppard's paintings are decent, not even close to an old master whom you have to come face to face with in order to see the difference (reproductions are a great leveller of talent). His use of grisaille grey undertones is rather trying and rigid. Look at half finished, or bad paintings of old masters in museums or in close up books and you'll see how different his approach is. Grisaille is a tried and used method, but most painters simply go with brown or sienna tones with local color. In any case, I am merely suggesting that his painting style is more suited for photorealism than old masters."
2,"Seems interesting, but this is not how the old masters worked","I'm happy with the formulas explained in the first part of the book, but the techniques explained in the second part are NOT the ones used by the masters. I'm sure about at least two cases. I happen to know that the Titian's and Caravaggio's procedures were quite different then the explanations in the book. The author admits that his advices are only one possible way to achieve the results of the old masters, but I think that the result itself is not fully reached. Titian use to create an underpainting with browns, reds and white and, even more importantly, Caravaggio use to paint the light areas on a very dark, almost black, surface, witch is the only way to produce his impact, the same impact that is missing in the author's work ""in Caravaggio's style""."
5,Great CD and Book,"I really enjoy this CD and book. The songs are really cute and clever. My Son is only 5 months old but I hope someday he will love the songs like I do and it will be something we can enjoy together. If you like Sandra Boynton's books, like I do, you will like this too."
2,Thanks for Cher-ing,"More than one CD are linked to the title CHER - GREATEST HITS. My review concerns only the version with a front cover photo of Cher in white on a pink background.This has always been a very weak album. There's a couple of high-charting songs here and a bunch of filler. The LIBERTY records BEST OF CHER, which contains her mid to late '60s stuff, is only somewhat better."
2,Pages fell off!,"I have only started reading this book, but already the pages 1 to 30 have come apart! And I handle books very carefully, so I am not to blame.Other reviewers have reviewed the content of this book, so I will not add to that. Except to say that it is dated now, as PS 7 has come out. Instead I recommend that you not buy this book because of the bad binding."
4,"Great contents, bad edition","I've watched 6 of Scott Kelby's videos, and he is absolutely great as a photoshop teacher. I could not wait to get this book, and the tips and tricks and contents of the book are great, and exactly on the level that was expected. The problem is with the book itself. Something went wrong in the production, and most of the images are dark and very hard to see. If it would not be for this fact, I would give it 5 stars. If you are looking for the best book on photo retouching, this is it."
3,Works if undisturbed,Flimsy. Plastic endings are small and slippery. Only glasses with thin stem and average diameter fit. It does the job if you handle it very carefully and position it far from the work areas.
2,Too little for so much,"While the content is funny, the cost of the book was shocking!! $40.00 I did not realize that this book is quite small, I gave this as a gift so am not able to provide actual size. Definitely not a ""got your attention"" table topper."""
1,Overdone,"As a Pilates instructor I find this video to be far off from the origonal work of Joseph Pilates. Aside from the distracting music, the models appear to be just that, hired models, and over directed at that. Jonathan Urla's egotistical introduction almost assumes personal knowledge of the Pilates founder, and is full of inaccurate information. The only redeeming factor can be taken from the attempt at showing many of the individual exercises fairly accurately. The so called bonus workout is an insult to anyone wishing to avoid a sales pitch for equiptment which has existed in the dance field for years. There is nothing new about any of it. I found the entire series to be an insult to the Pilates field."
5,Fixed my kitty's multiple issues!!,"this is a miracle product! My cat has been suffering from skin allergies and chronic respiratory issues for years. I suspect she has FHV-1. She had dry scaly patches on her skin and always had a sinus infection..after multiple cortisone shots over a few years, i discovered that cortisone helps the virus replicate and I wasnt really helping her. And her skin was so bad, she ripped her fur out so much she was bald in many places..After 2 weeks, her breathing improved, she grew her fur back and her dry patches were fewer in number. She was a runt and I rescued her from a less than savory place so I knew she would have issues. But this is the best stuff...better than the other lysine products ans she seems to like the taste which is a miricle b/c shes is terribly picky!You cant go wrong with this stuff! It made my kitty feel better and put me at ease knowing Im helping her without harsh steroids and expensive Dr. visits!"
4,Lysine for cats,"I received good, quick service and the product arrived as described. Even though I ordered it right before the holidays, it still arrived very quickly. My cat loves the taste and he'll lick it right off the syringe, which makes it much easier! I would definitely recommend it. The only negative that I could say is that with the way the notches are set up, it isn't precise how much you're giving, but since it's a supplement, you can give about 1 or 2ml no problem."
4,CLASSIC,"This album is a classic.... ""mass appeal"" has got to have one of the sickest beats off all timeHard to pick a favorite gangstarr album...but if youve like any of their tracks, this album won't dissapoint"
5,A great gem from 1994,"If you think that Moment of Truth is a classic, you're right, but don't forget about this album! What were you doing around the time when ""DWYCK"" hit your speakers or when ""Mass Appeal"" was constantly #1 on Rap City? And how about when Guru told you that ""Suckas Need Bodyguards""? This album joins the same rank as their follow-up, Moment of Truth."
5,SWEET SOUND,"CD was Brand New! I couldnt believe I found it in mint condition. Unbelievable sound quality...so glad i found it. Thanks man! Everyone is the neighborhood is turning necks now, when i drive :)"
4,spray paint,dont buy this here its 4 bucks at Walmart. but the paint works and has a nice color and texture. i have used it on all my guns and gear.
3,More burgundy than brown.,"I didnt get this but I had planned to before I saw one of my training teammates who had done a hex pattern on his Kabar sheath using 4 of the 5 Krylon camo paints. The brown, once set, had a reddish tint to it and looks completely burgundy. The khaki looks like a pale beige and the olive was really light. The tan looked good, he did the base layer in tan. I dont know exactly how he painted it but it was his second attempt ever camo painting something, now that I think of it he may have been too heavy on the brown and too light on the khaki. Either way, use caution because these colors can obviously come out much differently than expected."
5,Awesome,"I bought this product because it was recommended on a forum for blacking out grill/tailgate badges. Nearly everyone I read indicated that this stuff is a must use for plastics. I concur. You don't have to use an adhesion promoter, but I did adn it will likely last longer because of it. It is flat camo black. It went on easy and dries quickly. Fusion is very tough. I let it cure a few days, but you could handle it after 30-45 minutes. Krylon advises that you do not use a top-coat on the Fusion line. It's probably easier that way, so that touch ups won't require sanding.I have since used it on my hubcap centers (plastic, not metal) and they turned out excellent, also."
2,"Meh. Went on easy, looks good, still tacky after 3 weeks.","I used the olive drab to paint a new carbine rifle. Went on easy, great coverage, looks really good even with no prep of the surface. But after three weeks it smells like it's fresh paint, it's still tacky on the grip, and paint is just kind of wearing off on the grip where my hand and fingers wrap around. Good quick fix, but I don't know if it will handle long-term use.3 months later it still gets tacky if you hold onto a painted surface for too long. Paint is wearing off after not much usage. It looks good, but doesn't perform as promised. Dropping from three starts to two."
1,not updated,"This booklet is not updated, possibly in last 7-8 years. A lot of information about new (new as in last at least 5 years ) missing."
1,same old...,"compared head to head with 2005 editionvery minor difference, only ONE new medication presentoh. well such a waste of money..."
4,handbook,I use the handbook more days than not to help me make decisions about prescribing and to educate my clients about side effects. It is small and easy to carry with me all day. It is missing some drugs like Pristiq and different forms of drugs like no Seroquel XR. But its benefits outweigh the disadvantages.
2,NOT SO GOOD,"It is not the book that is expected, this book is only for residents/psychiatrists/doctors. It is not a book for an average ""Joe"" to have it misleads the reader and can cause problems with your doctor. Again, this is a book that will cause more problems in ones therapy."
3,The 2011 Edition,"Good news: The 2011 Edition is the third version of the book that I have bought over 9 years -- the book has been that good. Year after year, my patients and I have made good use of it whenever we needed succinct information about a psych medication. I always have a well-thumbed copy sitting on my desk ready for use.Bad news: When I compared my new 2011 Edition to my older 2009 Edition, I found nothing new at all. My expectation was that a new edition would have the medications that were ""new"" since the 2009 Edition and that also were commonly in use. For example, medications such as Pristiq (depression) and Invega (schizophrenia) were not in the 2011 Edition.Suggestion: If you have never purchased the book before, by all means buy it. If you have an older edition, beware."
5,Great little book,Pair this one with the other one and you'll have a dynamic duo.Carry it with you on Psych rotation!
3,"If you own the previous edition,you don't need this...","I have previously reviewed this book's earlier editions. I found it to be an excellent resource - concise, accurate, a good buy for the money. That said, I have to concur with a previous reviewer: if you have the previous edition, don't waste your money on this one. Essentially nothing in it has changed from the previous edition! And that, to me, is the key point.If you don't have the last edition, then by all means take a hard look at this little gem. It's great to carry with you, takes up little space, and covers just about all psychotropic meds. EXCEPT THE NEWER / NEWEST ONES. Maybe when it went to press it was too late to include the more current medications? Still a great buy as long as you don't already own the previous edition."
1,waste of money,"bought it for viewing by my students, no sound, poor selection just not what I had hoped."
2,Lame,"The book gives complete answers for the chapter tests. It only gives the odd answers for chapter sections, which does not make much sense since they are in the back of the book. The only difference is that they are much more detailed. I do not recommend this book. You are better off going to tutoring,section or asking your proffesor because they will give you complete answers for all problems."
2,W/A halogen lamp (otoscope),"Works well. Proprietary items like this, however, denote concern of profit over good of patients: this item was hard to find and not available in Vietnam where it is used. It took several weeks to deliver and was, frankly, overpriced."
1,worst product I've purchased in 52 years,"Wow, is this a piece of garbage! It wouldn't play about 30% of my CDs,particularly the last few tracks. It skipped like crazy. I had to fight to get full price back. The store wanted the original box, which my wife had thrown away. They finally agreed to refund my money--ALL of it. I've never seen such garbage yet. Sadly, it's made by RCA. I paid more money and got a great SONY."
3,"If you love Blondie, then this is for you","Cover their career and here it is...would not say that these are all platinum hits, but maybe a titanium career with longevity"
4,what about their later stuff?,"this is a good album that just misses getting 5 stars because of its disproportionate emphasis on Blondie's early career - there's only 3 tracks here from AutoAmerican! Too many tedious demos and a couple of throwaway remixes at the end make Blondie sound disposable. However, if you're not going to buy their individual albums The Platinum Collection is the way to go."
3,Much to bulky,This knife has a very excellent blade but the handle is much to thick and bulky. Could do without the clip on the bottom.
2,Tiny,"The picture is misleading, when I opened it up it's TINY. The Blade looks like its only 2 inches long followed by a handle that's much too large."
4,"Good book, but not useful for a small or solo firm","Overall this book had a lot of good points which I hope to incorporate into my practice. However, there is only one thirteen page chapter on how to market yourself if you are a solo or small firm. The majority of the rest of the bok is on how to market a larger firm. As a solo practioner I would have liked to have seen more information in regard to my situation."
4,Delightful!,"Undertow (Julesburg Mystery Series #3)Having read the first 2 books with these characters, I was excited to read the third-and was not disappointed. The characters become friends and the interactions between them and the plot keeps the readers' interest. The way the author weaves the location into the story makes it visible in the mind's eye. I love to lose myself in a book and this author provides the vehicle."
4,Undertow,I have read a number of Lorena McCourtney's books and find them very entertaining. The book was a very good read and I had trouble putting it down until I had finished it.
4,Great Trilogy,I've read all the books of this trilogy and enjoyed them all. It's great to read and rather exciting book with no explicit sex. I enjoyed them so much I told my 86 year old mom and she's ordered all of them as well.
4,McCourtney scores again,"If you enjoy Christian themed stories about real life type characters, you will like this book. I read one of her books and ended up reading 7 more as fast as I could. I got caught up in the characters and couldn't wait for the next book. Good clean fun!"
3,undertow,A cute series that is light but entertaining. A really good series to read when you want to relax and enjoy yourself
3,Goofy expression!,"Overall this panda is very cute, durable, and well-painted. However, whoever did the molding did not bother making the left and right side of face match up so the right side of the mouth curves back into the head much farther than the left. It reminds me of Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker character. Not too cuddly. The eyes are also looking in different directions.Perhaps this panda was dropped on its head as an infant? Lol! Something's just wrong here.Still, the item is in very good condition and, with the exception of the lopsided face, it's pretty perfect."
2,Poor Quality. Great idea.,Length:: 0:15 MinsThe batch (10 in all) of toys I received were all of very poor quality. They seem to break easily at the joints where the pieces snap on. I hope Skifas improves their quality since the toys appears to be a good idea.
1,"It's ok, with the exception of the biography on Satan.","Much of the information is exaggerated, incorrect, or assumptions based on wild imagination; try reading the bible if you want to know about Satan. Don't watch this sensationalist garbage on TV. They even use Dante's Inferno as a credible source of information if that tells you anything. These people have no clue."
5,Amazing!,"This profound and somewhat difficult teaching by Maitreya, the future Buddha, is presented here in a form that is easy to read and understand. The clarity of the translation makes up for the fact that it lacks a commentary. The introduction is a significant contribution toward understanding the Buddha's Teachings."
4,good product,Good product. Quick to arrive. Easy to install. Easy to clean so far. Make sure it's a permanent decision; does not easily remove. Quality material.
5,used on countertop with clear silicon adhesive,"I needed a countertop and this copper tile look is beautiful. Make sure to use a clear silicone adhesive. I adhered to wood base, and it is pretty durable if you don't bang your countertops too much. I love this product and it solved my problem countertop. Easy to install--not like grouted ceramic."
5,Best TV Ever,"The Sharp LC-37D90U is the best HDTV on the planet (as far as I know). I narrowed my selection down to the 37D40U and the 90U, and it was tough to decide. Go for the 90U; the native 1080 resolution is well worth the extra $$$. NFL games on Fox 1080i and DVDs are immaculate on this TV.Once you buy this set, you will need HD digital cable or satellite service, and you really need to go HDMI to see what this set is capable of. Get yourself a Logitech Harmony remote and an Oppo up-converting DVD player, and you will have a perfect setup for your viewing enjoyment."
5,Wow - these are grrrreat!,"Five stars to the Amazin Raisin lemon flavored raisin. A healthy, nutritious and tasty snack. I definitely plan to keep a handy supply in my pantry. PS - I like the orange and strawberry too."
2,not crazy about raisins,"Well, I saw the feedback on these raisins and was very eager to get them since everyone seemed really pleased with them. (Incidentally, love the fact Amazon has the feedback feature!) Anyway, gotta tell you, not too crazy about these raisins. The taste is kind of wierd for me. Was really hoping I would love them and I don't."
2,not so amazing raisins,"The raisins are small and kind of dried out with this lemmony coating, just not necessary. I read a review that said they were great, and we love raisins, but, not these."
3,Not their best...,I love just about every Skynyrd song ever made...but half of the songs on this CD are just plain worthless. A better buy is Second Helping or the Essential Lynyrd Skynyrd.
2,army boots from the 70s loveem but..,too many shoe strings. i like them but they just felt wrong for my foot a little tight and they rubbed back of my heel. Was exactrly what i wanted but just didnt feel right. too tight and too long.mostly tight.
2,"Great for Workout, Bad in Quality","There is no doubt that medicine ball strength and conditioning work is effective. However, this particular ball did not stand up to the work I demanded of it. After just two months of use, which was maybe twice per week, the ball's stitching gave out. I contacted the company directly and learned that the ball was only covered under warranty for two months after purchase. Disappointing from a company like Everlast. I have used other leather medicine balls and have never had one bust open like this ball did. So, I am returning to using what I originally had purchased... Dynamax. The price is a bit higher, but I guess I got what I paid for. If you are using this ball for high impact exercises, such as throwing against a wall or ground, I don't suggest buying this particular brand. Sorry Everlast."
1,Seams split on the first use,Had to return this after using it once and having the seams split. I read the other review saying this happened and thought it might be a fluke. It wasn't.
2,doesn't stand the bite,It only lasted half an hour for my dog. The skin is very thin. I would go with the Kong product that are more durable.
1,False ad on Amazon,Seller advertised a new Sata drive and shipped a refurbished ATA drive with USB connector and different brand. Seller has not answered emails and I must wait 2 weeks for Amazon to respond.
4,A Great Resource for Anyone Interested in the Causes of Psychopathy,"If you're already familiar with case studies of psychopaths but want to dig deeper into questions about the incidence and causes of the disorder, this book is a great resource. It's best for those whose curiosity has already been piqued about psychopathy, not as one's first introduction to the subject.Nonetheless, some self-congratulatory reviewers exaggerate the ""advanced"" nature of the book. The prose is academic but that doesn't mean that you need a background in psychology or a familiarity with the anatomy of the brain. If you can handle a college psychology course, you can handle this book.The book isn't a great choice for one's first book on psychopathy simply because it doesn't have the detailed case studies. Instead, this book focuses on descriptions and possible explanations of the mental states which underlie psychopaths' horrifying behavior."
5,Avon Scents Make/Save Cents,"I've been using Avon for years - also used to sell it. Today, Tomorrow, and Always are three of the best Avon has presented in long time that I REALLY like. I think Always is the best of the three, then, Today. For the money and the fragrance, Avon is the best."
3,Mediocre presentations...,"Who care about healthy alternative? I defeats the purpose of the nature of these dishes.The author uses the word ""we"" way too much- it is clear that he is not of the hills like us-- I am sorry but living in the area doesn't automatically entitle you to adopt our way of life as your own, and profit from it.We have done well over the years by keeping to ourselves... That is what makes our region unique."
2,Not happy w/ Eddie Bauer Products,"We got this bag as a shower gift. After 2 uses, the stitching that holds the velcro together pulled apart. We returned it and purchased a different bag, as my sister also had never ending quality problems with her Bauer bag. We also received the Eddie Bauer high chair, which was broken when we took it out of the box. We called customer service and they can't replace the part so they're sending us a whole new chair....AFTER we had to pay shipping to return the broken items and other ""proof"" of damage. UGH! I'm noticing a bad trend here! I would recommend looking at something different."
5,I also have a bag fettish!!,"This is one of several bags I received at my shower and I have to say, it's a fantastic bag. Has a lot (A LOT) of space for everything that a new mom could want to have. And me being a first time mom, I carried EVERYTHING!!I loved that it could hold what I wanted to carry. Now that my daughter is 10 months old, I know that I don't have to take everything with me so I have changed. But I still use this for my especially busy days when I won't be home and need the extra space.It will be especially handy for when we travel. And the pattern is neutral for a boy or a girl. (it matches my stroller) I would definitely recommend this bag!!"
4,Can two songs make an album?,"Coast of Marseilles and Cowboy in the Jungle make this one.These are two of Jimmy's finest ballads. While most people probably picked this up for Cheeseburger in Paradise, they got a whole lot more.Don't try and describe the ocean if you've never seen it, Jimmy sings in ""Manana"". Don't try and describe Buffett if you've never heard this. A great album. A quick note on Livigston Saturday Night. An EVEN better version can be found on the Rancho Deluxe sountrack. Check it out."
5,didn't find this one helpful,"a friend of mine gave me this book in preperation for a professional audition i had coming up and i found nothing in it worth performing. the conclusion that i came to is that the peices selected in the book are somewhat shallow and it's my opinion that if a young actor wants to ""win"" with whatever he/she is performing, that the material will need to be more real to life and personal to the performer. i don't meant to say that the book would not be usefull for acting excersises or cold reading work, i am, however, saying that young actors such as myself need more of a challenge in their performing than this book gives, especially for something as important as an audition."
2,Can't Win With These,"I found these monologues to be too simplistic and too short in length to be used as material for our Forensics competitions. As others commented, they could be fine for those wanting short material for practice or classroom experience."
1,This book is okay.,"I didn't really like this book. The monologs were of an unusual sort, they were really abnormal, that is, most of them were. They also were hard to ""act"" to. They just weren't my style."
5,Convenient,"The Wavebird's wireless connection to your Gamecube lets you play from anywhere you can see the TV screen, without worrying about the controller cable getting tangled up in people's feet, or wrapped around a table leg, or pinched under a chair.PRO:WirelessAA batteriesConnects just like a standard controllerCON:No warning light for when batteries are low/dying.The channel select button is easy to accidentally switch, which sucks while you're playing a hot action game.Only one color, one style. Blech!"
5,"Nothing to choke your opponent with, but...","my friends are huge gamerz, often our ""parties"" center around Spartan thrashing, zombie splattering, demon blasting or mushroom kingdom throw-downs... yeah we're real grown up. Now that there is an 11 month year old kid in the mix it is SO SWEET to not have a cord for him to pull out of the cube at the WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT or to be able to quickly flip the switch off when he suddenly decides to indulge in a little button-mashing. THANK GOD FOR CORDLESS."
4,Good condition but sticky buttons,The visual appearance was in good condition however two keys were sticky and therefore unusable. Luckily I found the tri-bit needed to open these controllers and clean the inside. The tri-bit is not an easy part to find where I live...
5,best wireless controller for cube,This is a flawless wireless controller fits perfect in users hand lil heavy but thats all good
4,Awesome,the wavebird can really take a beating. there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine. plus the game that ip[lay all the time is Super Smash Bros. Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing. I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird. After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery. its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this. but overall its a great controller
4,Solid,"Wonderful, solid product. It's good on batteries, but I think that might have a lot to do with the omission of rumble feedback. After playing with one for a year, I bought more."
5,Simple Idea...great results.,"I have to say that this controller is money well spent. A lot of people complain about the lack of rumble, and I admit that it was a concern for me as well, but once you are free from the cable the rumble issue seems rather minor. What I feel is the best feature is that the weight difference between the regular controller and this one is minimal, so you do not feel like you have a piece of concrete in your hands while playing. Overall, I would recommend this controller without hesitation."
4,It works but it comes dirty,It works but it came to my house dirty and it took a little elbow grease to get out the dirt but other then that its sweet
5,Thank you WaveBird,"I used to be a serious gamer back when I was a kid, considering my last system I bought was Nintendo NES (which I still own and use). Just recently I bought a Nintendo Gamecube off of a co-worker of mine. He only had one controller, which is a hideous neon orange, and I needed two for me and my partner. I was hesitant on buying the WaveBird only because of the lack of knowledge I have when it comes to Gamecube, and $35 for a controller seemed a little far fetched, at least for me not knowing the cost of recent games/controllers, but I gave in. Definately a well-worth-it-expense. I enjoy playing Gamecube from the comfort of my own bed without the hassle of getting tied up in cord."
5,A Good Working Controller!,"I dont have a gamecube but my friend does. When she comes over she brings it all the time. She has the same controller and its great! It has a on and off button so you can save the batteries and it works from a far distance! I went out of my room with the controller and my friend was inside playing, and i pressed a button and it worked! The door was closed too! I think this controller is great and you should get it for the holidays!"
4,BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO GAMES SINCE MARIO!,This controller ROX! I wish everything could go wireless like this. It works so well. NO PROBS at all with connectivity. The only thing this is missing is the RUMBLE feature ... but I never really cared about that anyway! The real problem is how long it took me to buy this thing. I've had my gamecube for more than a year and always thought the wavebird was too bulky looking but it actually feels better than the normal controller. Its great not being limited to 3 feet in front of the TV. And if you pause a game - No more cheating when you leave the room to do something because the controller can come with you! BRAVO NINTENDO! when the N5 hits package wireless controls with it.
3,"ok, i suppose","i dont have the platimun wave bird i have the white one ive had it for a while. its great for people who are desprate for space to play or have pets, but its not very reliable. its heavier and has 12 frequencies, people can cheat and screw you up by switching to your frequency. also ive noticed it tends to break down alot for me, the preblem i have alot is the b button gets broken. however, once in a while it unjams for a few weeks sometimes even a month or two, but just keeps breaking. also it needs batteries and people have a tendency to leave it on out of habit. if you ABSOLUTLEY MUST have this, go right ahead, its not too bad, but i you're unsure, stay away and pick up a few extension cords."
3,Not Much Wireless Without The Rumble,"Nintendo really has put so much in the works with the triumph of their Gamecube video game system. Yet, they definitely brought so many wonderful kinds of add-ons to this great system. Unfortunately, when I heard so much hype about their wireless controller, I felt a little bit stoned. The Wavebird controller for the Nintendo Gamecube fairs as a very accurate controller through many different channels. However, there are a couple of downsides to owning a wavebird. One of them is that you lose the vibration feel that the corded version has in itself by Nintendo. That remains unfortunate. Another downside is that sometimes, your controller doesn't work very well, when you have another remote beam in the middle of the way from a different device like the VCR, or television. All in all, I honestly suggest you buy the Wired version of the Gamecube controller, if you want a better time with the games you play."
3,wireless controller sucks,"it has a stupid on/off button in the middle, which you keep accidentally hitting when playing. it turns it off, and then you die. it's the most idiotic design, why the @*(&@ didnt' they put the on/off button somewhere on the back of the stupid thing or something.and it doesnt rumble either."
4,A great controller,"I've been using this controller for a while, with zero problems...and as long as I make sure I turn it off when I'm done, the batteries last quite a while.The only downsides, as I see it, is it's a bit big, and there's no rumble...but, then, a rumble pack would likely run the batteries down too quickly."
3,THIS IS ABOUT TO BE OFFICIALLY RELEASED,"This will be officially released (approx. May 2012) using a new fully restored original print from the UCLA Film Archives.The edition here may not have been entirely legit, but it will soon be very obsolete."
1,This paddle holster is ridiculously tight,I purchased a Fobus paddle holster for my P22 only to find that you can't possibly draw the gun from the holster. I have tried lubricating the holster and repeated holster/draw to try to loosen things up. There is no way to draw the guy without pulling the holster out of your pants and then using two hands to separate the holster from the gun. It's ridiculous!
2,Quality control issue factory second,I have been admiring this shoe for quite a long time but just could not see paying that much for a shoe. I finally talked myself into purchasing a pair but was not happy after they arrived. The pictures of these shoes are amazing but they do not look as good as the picture. The black dye was poor and showed quite a bit of brown color where it was not applied properly and I was embarrased when I wore them the first day and my boss noticed the defective dye job. Even though they fit perfect I returned the shoe as defective. I reordered another style of Allen Edmunds that arrived yesterday. This pair looks like the dye did not take very well either but in a different way. It looks like a paint roller with not enough paint as the color becomes spotty as it goes down the side of the shoe. I am contacting Allen Edmunds directly to discuss the two pair of shoes just to see if it is possible they are factory seconds. Will update after that.
3,Rare Quality Flub.,A surprising manufacturing defect caused me to return these shoes. I love my other four pairs of Allen Edmonds. None of them have any quality issues.
5,Made me want more!,"I received this book as part of my teaching curriculum, and read it all in one afternoon. It's fast, light, and gives so many opportunities to start discussions on what it means to be from two (or more) cultures, it's scary. I thought it ended too soon, but maybe (hopefully) that's because Ms. Chambers plans to write more about Marisol and her friends. Certainly will draw kids in and the ending provides (at least for me) a chance to allow my students to continue Marisol's adventures and ask them, ""What happens next?"". Good job!"
5,Worthy of Study,Aage Nielsen was one of the premier yacht designers of the 20th century and at last we have a book that sets forth both his personal life and professional career in full detail. All of his significant designs are placed in historical context and described in his own exquisite drawings and photographs. Anyone interested in yacht design will enjoy this book thoroughly.
5,Terrific gift!!!,I gave this book to a friend who has a wooden boat and he couldn't have been more thirlled. This truly makes a great gift!!!
5,Worthy of the Sea,An excellent summary of life and times of one of the great naval architects of this century.
4,Praise and Worship Harmonica,I got a Low F to add to my harmonici that I use at Church..The Low F is a great addition. I still use the regular F (in cross position) to play in the key of C.The Doctor of Laughology..bringing up a joyous noise../ps 95
4,Very nice book,"This book arrived in perfect condition, as promised. There are many nice recipes to choose from and I look forward to showing my family many new recipes."
4,Entertaining Spy Adventure,"Mitchell's stories fall somewhere between the thrillers of Len Deighton and Ian Fleming. Mitchell's government assassins are often flawed men--Callan is a former agent with morality concerns about his assignments. When he's called out of retirement , he meets the man he's to kill and becomes friends with him. All the while, he's under surveillance by his people who wonder why he's not completing the mission. Callan is desperately trying to find out why his victim has been targetted. This is a thrilling espionage story with unusual twists and turns. Dig this one up and savor it."
1,disappointed,"The book was rated at very good. When I received the book, it had standard wear-and-tear. But it also had a section of the book where the pages had separated from the spine. At best I would rate the book in an okay condition."
1,Terrible seller sent me the book that missed more than 10 pages,"I bought a book from them. they sent to me the book which missed more than 10 pages. I wanted they send the copy of this pages to me, but they did not da that. Do Not Buy Their Book, they will give you the book just like me."
1,This guy will swindle you,"I would stay away from this merchant,takes your money and will not send you your order.I've waited and waited but it'll just screw you over."
2,An Okay Book,"2-1/2 stars for a book I was not overwhelmed by, but the pages of this short noir novel raced by quickly enough. Thompson's prose, at least in this particular book which is the first by him that I've read, didn't resonate as powerfully as say Raymond Chandler or Walter Mosley or Chester Himes. But he did a fine job putting the reader into the confused mind of a lead character trying to figure out the constantly shifting whirlwind going on around him, and slowly revealing the young man's true character and motivations."
1,DREADFULL!!,"This is one of Thompson's poorest efforts. No real story and not very interesting at that.... you can tell the ending after 30 pages... no real 'mystery'. Basically a short story stretched to get an advance on a 'novel', it's only 138 pages at that."
2,Not So Swell,"So-so effort from the ace of pulp noir. Typical themes of a twisted loner with thwarted ambition, blackmail and a dark secret -- and a dollop of incest. Not too hard to see where it's headed, and not really worth making the trip."
4,Beautifully shot; Simple Yet Complex,"Beautiful cinematography coupled with honest, compelling interviews from all angles, make this documentary stand out. What it lacks in conclusiveness, it more than makes up for with deep, thought provoking questions."
2,Thrilling it is not,"This is a book that doesn't seem to know what genre it wants to be. The story has potential but there is little life in the characters, conversation or plot development. Too much political and scientific detail and a main character who does not ring true."
4,Nobody Knows This Stuff Better!,"Lori Andrews knows DNA and genetics and the impact it has on our lives. She has been on the front lines of the DNA debate for her entire career, fighting the good fight to tell the world how genetic material can be used and abused. Now, after twelve top-notch non-fiction books, Andrews has penned a dynamite thriller that uses an exciting plot to spread the word even farther about the scary new world of the tiny building blocks of life. The murderer is frightening (one of his methods makes me squirm every time I think of it) the main character is sexy as hell... Take it on the bus, take it the beach, but take it -- the story of ""Sequence"" and the story of what can be done with your DNA will scare you right out of your jeans!"
3,Good enough for a beach read.,"It's a first novel. It's an OK first novel. And for a first novelist, she's smart. She stuck with an area she knows well. The author is a reknowned lawyer on genetics. She knows what she's writing about. Her main character is a strong, smart and engaging woman. So...So, it made a good easy read. It wasn't one I couldn't put down, nor one I put down and never wanted to bother finish reading. It was somewhere in the middle, and that's pretty good for a first novel. The real down-sides were it was pretty obvious about mid-way through who the bad guy was - and where that was going to lead. Yes, it has a trite set-up - but then again, so do many very popular authors. Yes, it isn't up to the level of some experienced authors writing - but then again, there are some popular ones around that still have room to sharpen their craft. All in all a pleasant, engaging and informed tale - perfect for the beach."
2,awkward,"Ms. Andrews may be a terrific scholar and a terrific writer of non-fiction. But she has a good deal to learn about writing fiction. Other reviewers have commented on the slow pacing. But for me, a bigger issue was the awkwardness of the prose. There is a lot of exposition consisting of characters explaining things to other characters that those other characters would surely know already. The conversations do not ring true. It's one of those books wherein I constantly find myself saying ""The author did not know how to do this smoothly"". Hopefully Ms. Andrews will improve with experience."
4,Thought provoking first novel,I enjoyed this thought provoking and very current novel. Highly recommended if you are interested in genetics and science.
5,Ken Burns at his best.,"From the interviews to the music and photos, this is a very informative and inspiring piece. Long was a complex man, and, now nearly 3/4 of a century later, we are no closer to sorting him out than when he was shot. There are fascinating interviews and comments by Mrs. Hodding Carter Sr, and other contemporaries, but Robert Penn Warren absolutley steals the show with his readings and comments. It's good if you know a little about either Long or Louisiana going in (If your only frame of refrence is contemporary urban culture, you may have a little trouble understanding why some of these things happened...), but in any case, get it!"
4,The Kingfish,"For those of us old evough to remembr anything about politics in the 30s, this is must viewing. Huey Long once stated: ""I can beat FDR because I can out promise him."" Who knows what this man would have done if he hadn't died by an assisins's bullet. The people of Louisiana loved him like no other. The bigwigs in the state despised him with a passion. Fascinating period in American history."
3,"Straight transfer of a fuzzy VHS, no cleanup done at all.","<strong>NON: Live in Osaka</strong> (No director listed, 2004)It's great to finally have this footage, the video from which the live portion of the <em>In the Shadow of the Sword</em> album is lifted, on DVD. That said, if you were expecting anyone to have actually <em>done</em> anything to the footage during the DVD transfer--you know, like remastering it--you will likely be disappointed. It's still fuzzy, grainy, hard to make out much of anything that's going on. And the sound quality is identical to that on the CD (it's the fuzziest, most bootleg-sounding recording on my list of 100 favorite albums). If you've already seen the VHS version and you've got the album, you can safely pass on this until there's an attempt at a remastered version. ***"
3,THE BEST ISN'T THE GREATEST,"Slaughter's best of cd, contains their best work, but that doesn't mean it's great. Like a lot of hair bands from the 80's, Slaughter's music has not held up to the test of time. Their are a few gems on the cd, but for the most part it sounds like it all comes from the same cd.Slaughter has always sounded like an Aerosmith want to be, with out the wit or style of Aerosmith. And upon repeated listenings you wish that Slaughter had a little for of that. Slaughter seems all loud guitar, bass, and screaching high vocals.Up all Night, Fly to the Angels, are still fine songs, as are a few other songs. But for the most part, the songs don't hold the magic that they once did. Their music now seems like loud hollow noise."
1,"You sang what when? Who cares, fill it up on pump seven...","How appropriate,take out the ""S"" and you've gotlaughter, sweet laughter."
2,Depends where you're coming from,"Whether or not you'll get your doughs worth with this disk depends on what you intend to use it for.. Sure there are three or four catchy little ditties on here that might have been nice to listen to when you were 13 and got dumped.On the other hand this CD is great if you're searching for that I'm 13 and just got dumped feeling..Catch my jist??It's nostalgia folks.. Plain and simple.. I'm not going to put it on to chill around the house, but if you and some friends are getting drunk and talking about the eighties then this disk might just be the icing on the cake, eventhough you'd probably be better off throwing in Slippery When Wet or something that has less songs on it that make you want to do a Van Gough to your ear."
2,"""Desperately"" poor song selection...","If this album had ""Desperately"" on it from ""Stick It To Ya"", I would've bought it in a second. That's the best song on that album, a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless. And with 8 tunes coming from that album (as well as 8 from its follow up ""The Wild Life""), you would've thunk that ""Desperately"" would've made the cut over ho-hum songs like ""She Wants More"" or ""You Are The One"". As such, skip this one, the songs from ""The Wild Life"" aren't that great anyway. Get ""Stick It To Ya"" instead, it's a better best-of Slaughter collection than this one."
2,I was rather disappointed,"Its either the poor song selection that some other people said in their reviews (I dont know about that I dont listen Slaughters stuff much) or a completely different style than what I was expecting, but this album REALLY dissapointed me. I was expecting a wild ride (considering Slaughter was the lead singer of Vinnie Vincent's band) but instead you get dishwater instead of rocketfuel *ahem*. The only two songs I ever get any real enjoyment out of is Real Love and Up All Night. Of course Real Love is a ballad and not what Id call metal but at least its one of the few songs on this album Ive actually heard before on the radio. Youd think that if THIS was their greatest hits album youd hear at least most of the songs on the radio before, considering how big Slaughter was back in the early 90s. Follow the advice of other reviewers and get ""Stick It To Ya"" instead."
3,What's the point?,"This ""Greatest Hits"" compilation takes songs from two studio albums and a live album. I would think it's a little early in their career for a greatest hits. There are some good songs, but seeing as how I am a casual fan, I was expecting more. I guess I should have done more research."
2,The best of the ok.,"Graduating high school in 1990, I really can appreciate the whole hair metal thing. But unless your a hardcore ""Slaughter"" fan, they really were a two hit wonder. Not that they're so bad, it's just that they make ""Warrant"" and ""Cinderella"" seem amazing in comparison. Your best bet is to find their hit songs on a ""Hair"" collection, and hope that they're between a ""Motley Crue"" and ""Skid Row"" song. That should keep you up all night."
4,Steely Dan never gets ols!,Some of the best jazz/rock arrangements ever. It's a pleasure to listen to them at work! As for their harmonies they are smooooth and delightful! Nothing compares with great talent.
4,"Great game, and definitly worth the money!","Well I just picked this game up today, and have been playing for alittle while already, and so far I love it! I've had alota fun with it, and love it copared to Madden, and being honest, I almost like it better than 2K5, which up until now was my favorite football game made! So yea, if you know me, thats saying quite abit. However this is not a serious football game, if your lookin for a game thats acurate to the way football is acturlly made, this is not the game for you! But if u like to just sit down, and play a few games with your buds, go online, or play the great story mode this game is for you!"
5,AMAZING GAME!!!!,"I felt that this game was absolutely amazing and the graphics are cutting edge and better than MADDEN 06 by far. This game is amazingly addictive and the broken bones and gore never get old. I would highly reccomend this game to MADDEN lovers do to the fact that this game has everyting MADDEN has and a whole lot more including graphics that would blow MADDEN away any day and it basically has everyting you would've wanted in MADDEN 06 but didn't get. If you are a football video game fan then I would highly recommend this game above all of the ""top ranked"" games. Basically what i am trying to say is that this is a must have video game."
5,A 11-year old's review,"I have tracked this since announcement, and got it on release day. I haven't started Campaign Mode yet. Although, for parents, Quick Play is something not very bad for teens. This has gameplay from the older NFL Blitz games and some added touches like cheerleaders and the Clash Meter. The only questionable material in quick play is some use of language and the cheerleaders do some...things. Not bad for teens if getting for Quick Play. The game is extremely fun and addictive and hard to stop once a game has started. A definate 5 stars. Highly recommended. (Much better than any Madden)"
3,"Well, I guess it's okay","This game didn't exactly go ""over and above"" the predicted expectations, but it does have a couple of addicting parts. I think the only reason kids like it alot is because this is the only Mature rated video game they could purchase. If you're considering whether or not to buy Blitz: The League, please read this!PROS:Crisp and realistic graphics during gameplayVideos on the team you're playingThe injuries are mesmerizing to watchAwesome stunts you can performCONS:In the late Division 2/early Division 3, it starts to become nearly impossible to throw to any reciever without the computer getting an interceptionThe 'roids don't really enhance your gameplayYou can't have fun with the game after you've beaten itHorrible soundtrack- they didn't put any artists I've even heard of on itWell, there you have it. I hope you make the right decision."
5,the best game ever,this is the best football game ever made!!!!!! you can do dirty takels and it shows them breaking the bones on an x-ray!!!! also if you get unleashed you can take off peoples helmets and smake then. this game is for fans who like sports games where your obejctive is to heart the other team so much you win.
2,Could be a lot better.,"First off, anyone who says this game is better than Madden 06 is a retard. It's no way near as good as any Madden game after 2003. The gameplay is fun, but too many flaws. First off when you create your team you don't get to pick who your players are. They pick them for you. You can't trade them or nothing. Then in the middle of a game if your QB or HB is doing lousy you can't sit them out and put in new people. Your stuck with them until they get injured. Not to mention to make your players stats go up takes forever and you don't even have control over it. You just select what attributes you want for the player and wait forever before they get any better. Plus the storyline sucks. You don't know who you are in the game. Your either a player or the coach. I can't figure it out nor do I care. I'm stayin with Madden."
2,this game sux,this is one of the worst football games i have ever played. the only fun part is knocking the s*** out of the qb. other than that it sux
3,"Good Game, BAD Language","I bought this game for a friend and played it recently. It's a great football game, cool how the created teams are and such. The gameplay is pretty cool. The Clash thing is really cool, though I couldn't ever complete a pass with it (the WR kept moving WAY off).My only bone to pick with this game is the trash talking. I understand trash talking and all, but this was pretty extreme. They said ""mother f-"" like crazy, along with other f-bombs, the sh-word, and other language. Even a little wouldn't have been too bad, but it's like every play almost! Definitely unnecessary.That's why I only give it 3 stars overall."
2,All that for nothing,"Very fun game to play (if you dont like getting anything accomplished). I spent many a night playing this game and enjoyed crushing people and causing many, many injuries. However it was a giant let down to find out that after all that hard work building a team you could only continue playing with it online. What a let down. Also to find out that we couldn't play career mode with 2 people. Another let down. So unless your into crushing the opponent with nothing to show for it. Save your money."
3,this game is so-so,"I rented this game and first off the controls are hard to learn, someone drops an f-bomb almost every thirty seconds, and between each play theres a cut sceene which gets annoyin, but the dirty hits are kinda cool and i like when it shows the bone breakin. Overall i give this game 3 stars."
3,It was ok,"I just had 2 new toilet installed at my home. It was the kind of toilet set that when you close the lid it never slams, and close the lid quietly and slowly by itself. My old lid cover doesn't fit anymore because the lid was made differently, thought I try this one since it stretch and is one size for all. Unfortunately this one still too small and feel cheap."
3,Buyer Beware,"At the bottom of the DVD cover, in admitedly smallish print is the proud statement ""Digitally Remastered Sound enhanced"" - Could someone give a definitive explanation of ""Digitally Remastered""? Please!! Every fan of Corman knows all these films have been issued many times - solo and in box set collections. I have 4 of them myself, but this was cheap and it said ""DR"" so I thought here is my opportunity to get good prints...NO - OK they are quite watchable, but NOT Mint. ""SWAMP WOMEN/SHE GODS/THE TERROR/DEMENTIA 13"" are no better than my Alpha DVDs and videos from other sources (I am one of the few people who don't enjoy ""Little Shop.."" and I haven't seen it in this collection). So, just be warned-If you haven't got them already then this collection could be for you. If you have I really wouldn't bother. Sad but true cos the films are fun. (Will we ever get OKLAHOMA WOMAN???)"
2,Baby falls into it.,"I used this sling with my newborn son and I feel it's simply too big for him; if I don't support his head, he keeps slipping down into it w/c can be annoying. I gave this item two stars since my son seems comfortable in it - he sleeps in it - but for me, it's a little akward. I am currently looking for another sling."
4,Stylish and it works!,"This is the Mrs writing in and I have had pretty good success with this carrier so far. My baby is 2 1/2 months old and I have had him in it quite a bit already. I can go to the grocery store, do light cleaning, etc. with the baby tucked snugly and happily in the sling. Plus it's not as cumbersome as many carriers are. At first I would position the baby in either the laying position or upright facing me. The padded edge would help support his head when he drifted off to sleep which was very nice. Now that he's a little older I can turn him around and have him facing outward. The back of the carrier is made kinda like a shirt - so the weight is more evenly distribulted and doesn't cause shoulder or neck strain. The only thing I don't care much for is that it doesn't offer much support to the lower back. Other than that it's great."
2,Awkward,I have a front carrier and this sling. It is comfortable across the back but I feel like I have to hold the baby while she is in it. I also feel like she gets balled up. I have only used it a few times and she has fallen asleep in it so I guess it is comfortable enough. It does have adjustable straps but I feel I am a bit too short to use it. I am not sure how women with large (D or larger) breasts would like it. I just feel awkward using it.
4,Great for the money,"These were pretty easy to install. They were a little difficult to cut with a regular scissors. Some of the squares fell off, but with some new tape or a little glue they are staying up. I am still wondering how long they will last, but for the money and time for install they were worth the risk!"
4,unbelievable results,"These tiles transformed my kitchen. Already nice, but definitely had an unfinished look behind our nice stainless steel and black stove, and tied in our new stainless refirgerator. I only did the 30""x30"" space. The tiles went on really fast and I did the diamond pattern which looks more professional. The only problem is that the stickies, which I thought might come off the wall since it is not a smooth surface and maybe did not get cleaned enough, came off of the TILES themselves. I had to ROUGH UP THE SURFACE and use glue to put them back on the stickies which held to the wall just fine.But, THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL."
5,P{eal and stick triangle tiles,Just what I needed to complete my backsplash. They're perfect.Thank you.
5,Made a wonderful dramatic backsplash,Bought about 3 sets of the brushed silver/stainless steel looking square tile sets & put them all around my kitchen back splash & they look so good & were so so easy & fun to put up! They look way more expensive than they really were! My mother loves them so much she is buying her some!
2,"It looks good, but is disappointing!","We registered for this bouncer and we were very happy when we received it. That was until I put my baby in it for the first time. It jerked him from side to side and it is too upright for him to really enjoy it. He ends up all squished up or his head is falling over since he can't control his head yet. The bouncer is very loud. The rocker doesn't work on carpet only on the tile. We have used it a few dozen times and can't get the rocker to work anymore. This is made for older babies who can control their muscles to sit in it. Also the light bar, there is no way a baby could activate it, I had a hard time getting it to turn back on myself. I was so sad to see such a good looking product work so poorly. I am sad that I didn't listen to the reviews I had read after we registered for this. I thought it would be great, but was proved wrong. Don't waste your money on this!"
2,cute but loud and uncomfortable for my little one!!!,"I registered for this item because it was soft and fleecy, and looked cute, but I was very disappointed. It is so loud!!! It also is very jerky when it rocks back and forth. My son loves the light up bar, but you can barely hear the music over the loud sounds of the chair. We ended up buying a different bouncer to use. Very disappointing!"
2,Not as great as I thought,"This bouncer struck me as the best deal because, not only does it bounce and vibrate, but it rocks. Well when my daughter was newborn- 5 months she likes the rocking for a few minutes, but then wanted out. But from newborn to now (7 months) she was never able to bounce because it's not steady enough to do so. there are little gadgets on the side to stop it from rocking but they really dont work. Plus the toy bar on it was too far for her to reach until 6 months. She loved watching the lights on it, but one of the lights blew after a week. Honestly, I ended up just using it to feed her baby food until last month when she was able to sit in her high chair. So it's not a great bouncer, and there are better ones for the same price."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"We registered for this bouncer for our baby shower because it was cute and looked comfy. We liked all the features. Well, our son is 3 weeks old and we were only able to use it twice, then the on/off switch broke so the thing no longer rocks. It does vibrate, however it is pretty loud and annoying. I tried to go to the manufacture's web site, but this item isn't in the bouncers they show. So I emailed them hoping for some kind of restitution. I'd take it back to the store...if we kept the box."
3,It's alright- nothing fantastic.,"My son is only 8 weeks so we decided not to use the toy bar yet. He likes this bouncer alright- it sits him too upright though, and his head still slumps {he is also heavy- 12lbs}. The rocking is nice- that is a good feature, plus you can put down the little stoppers so it doesn't rock."
2,Great Idea---Big Battery Sucker,I love the rocker idea. It really is a big convenience when you cannot rock the baby for a few minutes. But that's just it---A FEW MINUTES!!!! I use this product the very least and am already on my third set of 4 D batteries. I use my cradle swing 100% more than this chair and it is still on its first set of D Batteries. (My my baby is only 4 weeks old mind you!!) I don't believe this is good value wise because you end up spending alot more money on ALOT more batteries!!!
1,I wish I hadn't...,"I bought this bouncer for my newborn because it looked very comfortable. I liked the fact that it rocked and vibrated. I had seen online reviews that rated this product poorly but I thought I knew better.Oh boy was I wrong. Here are my issues with it. First, a newborn does not sit appropriately in this bouncer. The back of the seat is set up too vertical for a newborn. My son's head just flopped from side to side. I had to buy a neck cusion just so his head wouldn't fall over. Second, the rocker only works well on hard floors. It also makes the loudest noise when rocking. The vibrator on it shakes the whole floor too. Also, the little arm that plays music that I thought was sooo cute, well, it goes off after about 30 seconds unless it is activated...which a newborn obviously can not do.All and all, I wish I wouldn't have bought it. I'd take it back, but we got a little over jealous and threw the packaging away before my son was even born.BEWARE!!"
4,Daughter loves it!,"I really like this bouncer. My daughter loves it too. The chair is great for her to sit up in. She loves the lights and the rocking motion side to side. The reason(s) it did not get 5 stars is because when the chair is on rocking side to side, the music is not loud enough. In order for my daughter and myself to even hear it, the chair has to be turned off. Also I noticed one of the stars does not light up but I have not really played with it to see if I can fix it."
1,DANGEROUS!,"I was very disappointed with this bouncer. The way the straps are attached to the seat, if your baby can even sit forward a tiny bit, the whole bouncer can tip forward or sideways. The straps are not attached to the bars, they are a part of the soft seat, so the whole piece of fabric tips forward. I turned around to get something out of the oven, and when I looked back, my daughter was on the kitchen floor face first with the bouncer on top of her. I contacted the company and got my money back."
3,A little disappointed,"I recieved three different bouncers as shower gifts, I was adamant about keeping this one because it was so soft and cute and I thought it would be perfect. My baby is only 1 week old, I put him in it and he sunk down and his head just flopped over to one side. This bouncer is sitting to upright for a newborn and it doesn't adjust. I bought friend of mine the baby papasan bouncer and I wish I would have gotten that one instead her baby looks so cozy and comfortable in it. I would have given this bouncer two stars but I am hoping my baby will love it once he gets a little older."
2,Would consider other bouncy chairs,We purchased this chair based on looks...loved the moons and stars and it looked so cozy. The rocking side to side does not work on ours and it is loud and annoying. Our daughter has loved the vibration. I have difficulty unclipping the clips. I find many of our other baby items have better clips. I have also pinched my finger about 4-5 times when clipping the safety strap. I haven't read any other reviews with people having this issue so maybe it is just me. I really do not like the fact that it does not adjust to different reclining modes like our other bouncy chair. The toy arm on it looks good but I don't think it is interactive enough. We received another bouncy chair as a gift and we use that one downstairs. We use this one in our bedroom. When she is in it on the bed her back touches the bed so it sags a little more than expected. She only weighs 12 pounds. Definitely would recommend another bouncy chair (but wish there were others as cute).
1,Disappointed in this bouncer,My daughter received 5 bouncers in all at her shower decided to keep this one and returned the other 4 back to the store.She chose to keep this one due to the stars (which was her theme) and blue in it since she knew she was expecting a boy.First few weeks we put him in it and he slumped and was very hard to keep him in there comfortably. Now that he is almost 3 months he still end up to one side and it is very noisy the back bottem bars are not very secure they do not snap in they can easily be pulled out. The batteries for the music and lights seemed to have worn out very quickly and the music and light bar is positioned in a way that it is right in babys face.The ONE thing we do like a bout it is the bar is easily able to be moved to the side making it easy to get to baby. Are currently looking to go out and purchase a new bouncer. (Should have kept one of the other bouncers for back up)
2,Returning this item-Mother of two,I bought this bouncer for my 6-week old son. It has an incline that makes him slip and he can't see the stars that light up. It also jerks when rocking. It makes a lot of noise when rocking and the vibrations are not very strong. I will be returning this one and trying something else. He loves his Graco full-size swing and we may need another portable swing.
1,twinmommy,"Horrible!! Do not buy. SInce I have twins, I bought 2 different kind if bouncers & this one was awful. It's very shaky & wobbly. If your baby moves in it (which all babies do!) it leans over to one side. It's dangerous."
1,Bugs! Bugs! Bugs!,After looking at the samples I purchased the software. Some of the 3D styles don't work...on many of the styles you can't control the syncronization of the photos and the music....on running some of the presentations....the presentations causes my computer to crash! If they get the bugs out it could be really good software....until then.....skip this one!
1,A piece of junk,"So many bugs in this software, and there is no customer support. It is a piece of junk !"
2,Live Up To Promise,The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will. They are organized and packaged well. The sizes provided accomodate all collars.
4,collar stays,these are cool; i like them. better than plastic stays. and i prefer the shiny metallic finish to gold or bronze color. i just with the pack came with more of the 2.5/3.0 inch stays instead of the 2inch stays.pd
2,Eh!,"it's easy to wash however if you don't have your baby 'just right' in the carrier, she'll be lopsided and crooked, more so for small babies - the sides curl in over the baby's face or she'll be almost face down - after awhile you're back will start to ""shift"" - i found myself leaning over more - it's not ergonomically correct if you have back problems or had an epidural (with a lot of re-sticks) - the front baby carriers are a lot better - BABY BJORN is expensive but worth every penny - it' durable, washable, easy to use (difficult to figure it out when putting it on but you eventually figure it out) - you can get your baby in and out of the carrier with minimal movement - i had a collically baby who fell asleep in it and was put in the crib quietly without being pulled, jerked, or yanked"
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this as a gift when my daughter was born. This literally was the worst gift that I received. It was extremely uncomfortable on my neck. My daughter looked so uncomfortable in the carrier too. Both my husband and I tried on the carrier and we both had the same complaints. Not only did my daughter look uncomfortable in this, she was unable to move her head. I also thought that after a while, she would probably get hot and want to move around. I couldn't return it to Babies R Us, because I did not have the receipt and had thrown away the box it had came in. Instead of passing off this ""pain in the neck"" to someone else, I just threw it away in the trash."
4,"well used, and washable","This sling is easy to use, and convienant. If the baby spits up, or soils the leachco sling it is easily washed. It is adjustable to accomidate a growing baby, and you can nurse in it as well if you are a breast feeding mother. The only reson I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is difficult to transfer a sleeping baby to a carseat."
1,Don't waste your money,I found a similar one that was on clearance and couldn't bear to see my baby in it. She looked so uncomfortable. It may be alright for very small babies but mine although small is a long baby. Definetly not worth your $.
2,"Interesting, but hard work.","Having lived in Arizona for a few years, I have recently found myself wishing to know more about the history of my new home state. This was one of the books I picked up.The history of Arizona is as varied as its topology. Early indian settlements can be traced back to pre-Christian times and there has been a constant migration of people both in and out of the state.This book begins well and the reader is held in rapt attention for the first few chapters, up until the first inter-Spanish-American encounters and Mexican independence. Then it starts to become hard work.I felt that the writer lost interest as the book progressed. You could almost feel boredom creeping into the chapters. It's a pity because there is much to be learned from the book. I would still recommend it for the early chapters. there isn't too much else on the market if you are interested in early Arizona history. But borrow it from the library first."
3,Not as well focused,"With a novel of this design, you need Spock there. Simply providing a ""computer"" that acts like Spock is not the same thing. The minor characters are not as well rounded as I would have liked, and Kirk's love intrest comes accross as more of a slut than a ""jaded"" woman from his past. I really didn't care for the 'breasts' or 'thighs' or cleavage-esq comments in the book, as it took away from the overall story. Had this been made into a show/movie, I'm sure fans would be screaming at their TV's with words like ""Come on, Kirk! You're smarter than that! Put 2 and 2 togehter already!"""
3,Not the best mystery I have ever read,"I was told that the Anna Pigeon series were great mystery stories. This is the first in the series. If this is an indication of what the rest of the books will be like, I will not read them. I thought the mystery was lame and character developments were poor. There were grammatical and editorial errors also."
2,Only Nevada Barr I have ever read,Read for a book club. Thought it was weak and am not tempted to read any other books by this author.
5,A wonderful book,"If you have run out of Tony Hillerman books to read, you are not out of wonderful Southwestern mysteries. It's easy to see why Nevada Barr won the Agatha Award for best first mystery. Her unlikely heroine allows the readers to feel like they are helping solve the crime at her side. In addition to being a very good book in its own right, this book sets the stage for a fine series of mysteries."
2,"""what""?????","I read all the reviews and thought I would give this a try. wow. I was very disappointed in this book. It became so old after the first 50 pages. It was slow and took forever to finish. Just couldn't get into the characters. The characters didn't have any depth. The last page is a 'what' is this, it drops you like a brick. I think the writer just gave up and took the easy way out.. finished it with a ""maybe"" she will return. uch!"
2,Where's the Mystery?,"This is the first of the Anna Pigeon series. Nevada Barr is a fine writer, and puts words together well. However, she has a tendency to put in flowery phrases a bit too often, her character has very limited thinking (the first thought should have been involvement by the ranchers around the park, but that turned out to be last). The final ""battle"" is immensely flawed, since her character apparently never even considered shooting the guy in the foot. You are left wondering if Anna is a cold blooded killer who cares more for animals than people, and whether she bothered to get the rest of the bad guys put away. Finally, Anna just isn't a likeable person, so why would I want to read more about this woman? Usually, for serial novels, the main character needs to be at least somewhat likeable to keep you coming back for more. I'll try reading others from this series, since its popularity means something is there, but if the first is a measure of this set, it may not keep my attention"
2,Off track with this Kitty,"I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth. But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel. But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God. How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for ""an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity""..."
1,anna pigeon,We do not like how she writes. It's hard to follow. It's as if she is trying to impress you with her big words. Most fiction readers do not want to lug around a dictionary when they read their fiction. We won't buy another of her books.
3,MIXED FEELINGS!!!!!!!!,"This is the first Nevada Barr book I have read. In my openion it was not really good and not really bad. It had parts I enjoyed and parts I had to struggle through. Anna Pigeon is a ranger in Texas hill country. Two different rangers are found dead, everyone but Anna thinks they were accidents. She goes about proving they were murder. In doing so an attempt is made on her life. But, why were the rangers killed? What is going on??? I think the action is a little slow, maybe to much talk and thought. I don't really know but it just never grabed me the way others have. I notice the second book has her at Lake Superior, thought she was to be a ranger in the Southwest. May or may not read another one, won't if I have something I know I like on hand."
5,One of the best,"Anna Pigeon faces hardships extremely well, and in this novel, she lives through a murderous ordeal that's a page bturner."
4,Good read,"This was the first Anna Pigeon book by Nevada Barr that I read and thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot twists and turn were enough to give a person whiplash!! I found it a good but not great read, satisfying but not over the top."
4,"Like her other mysteries, a good read for the settings!","As far as mysteries go, I thought this book (and the other Anna Pigeon books I have read) were pretty good, though perhaps not among the best-written I've ever read. What made the books enjoyable for me were the settings. Each book takes place in a different National Park, where the main character, Anna Pigeon, is stationed as a ranger. We've traveled to several of the national parks featured, and her descriptions are very evocative of the sites and bring back great memories. They also provide some interesting perspectives on the life of a park ranger! If you're a National Park Fan, you'll enjoy following Anna Pigeon around on her various assignments."
3,ANNA PEGION THE AVENGER,"ALTHOUGH THE BOOK MOVED SLOWLY IN SOME AREAS THE OVERALL STORY IS CAPTIVATING, I FOUND MYSELF SITTING ON THE EDGE OF MY LAWNCHAIR BREATHLESS WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. BARR IS SO GOOD AT HIDING THE VILLIAN THAT YOU ARE TRUELY BLOWN AWAY WHEN HE OF SHE IS REVEALED."
4,wonderful book,I have many of Nevada Barr's book's and I have never been disappointed.This is also one of her best. Never dull and never disappointing.Anna's love for the mountain lion and her caring for her friends keep her going to find out who the killer is and what is going on and she almosts get killed herself. Great book.
2,promising...but not quite there,"I am glad I didn't read this book in the series first; she improves tremendously in the next book. Still, it's worth reading to see the character development."
4,"Moody, emotionally rich crime novel","Let's be clear here, Anna Pigeon has a slight drinking problem. She also has a few prickly personality quirks that don't always endear her to her fellow officers in the National Park Service. This is one terrific debut novel, by a writer who knows and recognizes a whole lot about the natural beauty of the West Texas countryside. As a consequence and regardless of questions about a mysterious mountain lion that may or may not have killed a fellow ranger in a desolate remote canyon, this is a crime novel rich in emotional layers. The stalwartly moving plot is also satisfying.Nevada Barr combines simple but powerful elements of nature with more complex and darker forces of human nature in a story with many twists and turns. Her characters are fully realized and fit comfortably into their milieu. Barr's prose is stylish and she writes with great feeling for the country, so that we readers develop a fine sense of place."
5,Look Forward to the Rest in the Series,"First in the Anna Pigeon Series. Years ago I was told that this was a great series, but I just didn't believe the person who told me. Guess I should have. Anna is a National Park Ranger and when two of her fellow rangers have mysterious deaths Anna investigates, almost gets herself killed. Anna will question many things in her life, but she makes for a great character."
2,Amateurish First Effort,"Although Mr. Boot's objective is admirable, he fails to deliver a cogent and thoughtful critique of the American judicial system. Perhaps, if Mr. Boot had an educational and professional background in this area, his book would have provided more inciteful analysis rather than being packed full of bromides and anecdotes.Sensationalizing the shortcomings of the judiciary does not further the debate or help us toward the ultimate solution. Obviously, this approach reflects Mr. Boot's journalistic background which generally entails glitz over substance."
5,Spinning Yarns,"I challenge you to name a singer/songwriter who tells stories comparable to this guy's. Carmen, Billy Voltaire, the Railroad Lady, Spooner, and Merrita, to name a few, are so rich in character. The songs really transport you to Havana, Miami, and the Keys; the songwriting has such depth!"
2,Not a play thing,"I bought this doll because of how cute it is and it just called out to me. I see no educational value. As far as durability, it's up on a shelf just so I can see it every day. I am not a collector. I just buy things that strike my fancy, like this doll. I have also bought the small hedgehog doll and my kids have played with them for at least a year. If you want educational, get a leap pad. If you want cute and cuddly, get this doll."
1,What the...?,Ok. I received this gift for my newborn daughter for Christmas 2002. I just don't know what to think. Sure it's cute but does it really serve a ourpose other than that? Not really. My daughter is 2 months old and she'll have absolutely no idea as to what the heck it is for quite some time. It's more of a gift for someone who's a touch older by years!
5,We fought!,"I love this album with much, adoration. Anyways yeah this album is really good, I've been listening to it for quite a bit since I've got it and it rocks... hard! They have a way of mixing sort of an indie sound with harsh emotional hardcore. ""Whoa Mic I thought you hated glam hard core."" My friend calling this glamcore would be an insult, these guys transcend with intelligent yet simple lyrics, to well thought out break downs. Caught in A Flood With The Captain Of The Cheerleading Squad is just an amazing song that sort, wow it gets me man. Anyways break up with your girl and get this, you'll love ten times more. It's funny how they turn the cover inside out on the cd display on this site, it really goes the other way around."
5,Yeah...,"I have found that most emo music is crap. And with a name like ""I Hate Myself,"" it was hard to not immediately assume that this was yet another group of 20-somethings stuck in the past, whining about mom, dad, teacher, and girlfriend.Not so.Not at all. This band is almost raw emotion. Every song on this album can send a shiver down my spine. I would recommend it to anyone..."
1,A disappointing book,"I'm taking an introductory syntax course and using this book. The book is too wordy and at the same time overuses abstract concepts that are just introduced mostly without examples which could have made the text understandable. The author refers you to different chapters from the very beginning to understand each concept making you feel overwhelmed. He could just explain things simply, move on and get to other points when it's the right time. The concepts are easily understandable when a teacher explains them to me but this book just makes me feel I'm stupid. I have never found a book this difficult and don't really know why my teacher asked us to purchase this for an introductory course in syntax."
2,Interesting but confusing,"The other reviewer is absolutely right--this text is NOT an entry-level text, even though it claims to be. I have an M.A. in linguistics and am currently working on a Ph.D., and I have some background in syntax, and I find this text quite difficult to follow. Some examples Adger lists as ungrammatical are grammatical, and vice versa. Adger seems to sometimes make claims without adequate explanation to the reader (e.g., he lists Adjective as [+Verb, -Noun]), which is disturbing because this is supposedly an introductory text. If you want an introduction to Minimalism, don't look here. If you're already a specialist in the field, this may be a good addition to you're collection (but you should be the judge of that--check it out from the library first)."
2,Commentary on confusions caused by this book,"I am a freshman in MA program now. Having studied this Core Syntax for almost a semester, I get confued with some of the ideas in the book, especially when going through those obscure examples and explanations. People who have few or who don't have background in Linguistics will definately get confused with minimalist program or even Syntax if using this book. Maybe this resulted form the author's skipping too much.Maybe the author wants to make his argument clear, using step-by-step assumption to give evidence. But in fact,most of us suffer more reading it in this way.I think there are still lots improvements to be made in this book..."
5,"Blessed, Beloved....Bahamadia","Many 'rappers' have deals, but very few emcees (MCs) are labeled and mainstreamed today. The bulk of them are underground and/or poet lounge familiars. Bahamadia was neo-soul/hip hop way before the term became popular. Eccentric, sultry, soulful and all with a head nod for every track. BB Queen had a nice flavor as well, but not since MC Lyte and/or Latifah has a female emcee blessed the booth this way. I took a chance on this album in 1996. I spotted it at a sound shop in North Carolina and I was intrigued. Hearing of Bahamadia by way of Butterfly from Digable Planets made me think they ran in the same circles. Sorry Butterfly, compared to this album and BB Queen you only have an arc. 1-15...this album is a blessing for all hip hop followers. I have had this album since its release, and for 10+ years it is still in constant rotation. If you don't have it, your collection is not complete."
3,O.K!,"This ablum is average, most of her songs are boring because of her voice. But with help from people like THE ROOTS on ""The Jawn"", it gives the album a little more creativity."
5,This Bring back so any memories.!!!,"love this cd sence i was a teenager...hearing it now after years of of having a copy ...sounds freash ,innovated and a head of its time!!"
2,Quality isn't strong,"I was looking forward to getting this CD as I've had a few of Bahamadia's songs on a CD burned by a friend for years. However, I was disappointed in the audio quality of this CD, but I'm not sure if it's just this CD, or how it was recorded in general as I've since gotten another one of her CD's and the quality was the same. I love her lyrics, just wish I could easily hear them, especially while in the car."
3,"Nice bag, but stains too easily","I bought this bag because it was a good size, and was stylish enough that I could use it in lue of a purse. The main problem I have had is that the microfiber stains when the bag gets wet. Since I had to use this bag to carry juice, milk, etc., it stained pretty quickly, and there are no care instructions to get the stain out. Its a nice bag if you keep it far away from liquids, not always possible with a young child."
5,One more testament that this is the little bag you're looking for,"I've had this bag for nearly a year now, have totally worn it out. Now that I'm on the diaper bag hunt again I am truly learning how unique this bag is! I'll probably get it again!It is a perfect bag for running errands or going on short outings, which is what I mostly do. It is small enough to feel more like a purse, but still has plenty of room and great organization. The two big zipper pockets on either end of the bag really make the difference in the design, in my opinion. I only have one baby, so I don't know how roomy it would be for those carrying items for multiple children.It is stylish, instead of babish or utilitarian looking, and it's a bag that my husband will carry around without a problem =)."
2,Way too much treble!,"Usually Dayton makes really good stuff, however these are really not great. I installed these in my bathroom and hooked up the same amp I previously had hooked up to a couple Dayton bookshelf speakers (same size) and I cannot EQ the sound enough to compensate for the MAJOR treble these speakers put out. They also seem to distort at much lower volumes than the equivalent bookshelf speakers.I realize that wall mounted speakers are not going to be ideal considering that they don't really have a matched box, you are at the mercy of the space between the studs in the wall that you mount them in, however I really think that these are not crossed over correctly and the distortion factor screams CHEAP!The only nice thing about these is the price, so... I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Introduction to rock collecting,"This is certainly an excellent and handy introductory reference for anyone wanting to get into rock collecting. Clear and easy to read, the book provides a wealth of information, and has a number of illustrations. These illustrations are, however, black & white; there are no photos in this book. Nevertheless, an excellent book."
2,Not for Identification of stones,"This is for Identification of Rocks such as Granite and the like, not for Stones or Semi-precious Stones Don't be fooled"
1,Numerous copy errors and pedestrian writing at its worst,"What is this book ... a first draft?! I've read voraciously for the better part of my 53 years but **never** before have I seen a book with more copy errors than this one ... everything from misspellings to grammatical errors to omitted words.In addition, I found the writing to be pedestrian, overblown, and without focus. Why the N.Y. Times gave this book a good review, I'll never know. In my opinion, it's nothing but wretched ... if it were possible to give zero stars, I would."
5,"If you like Caleb Carr, you will like this",It is a great book. This novel is similar in style to Caleb Carr.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to get lost in historical novels
3,"Good instruction, somewhat flawed execution","Overall, this video should be very useful for guitar players wishing to learn slide techniques.These techniques were presented clearly, and were easy to follow, even by a complete beginner such as myself.However, the audio has an annoying background hum, and the video is sometimes slightly out of focus. This is unacceptable in the digital age. I suspect the old VHS format was simply dubbed onto the new DVD format, with a resultant loss of quality.I rate it 3 out of 5 stars."
2,not what I thought,"I was at a Race for the Cure and we had a Nia instructor that did a routine for the crowd to get everyone warmed up. I loved it! This DVD is made by the founder of Nia, but includes alot of out loud grunting and the like. That's not my cup of tea even when I am alone. I think I'll stick with yoga."
5,The True Pioneer in Film Theory,"Christian Metz's essays on film language are a milestone in semiotics and film analysis. If his terminology may be slightly hard to grasp immediately, it is because he is seeking clear and rigorously defined concepts, strongly grounded both in film practice and in structural linguistics. While structural lingusitics may no longer be a major reference in current intellectual discourse, Metz's book is indeed still extremely useful in understanding some key concepts of film, such as the ""pro-filmic"": what does an object become when it is standing in front of the camera? Abundant examples from French and American film generously help the reader (and it would be time to reprint and redistribute ""Adieu, Philippine"", which Metz thoroughly analyzes)."
3,Don't get this unit for Sirius Radio...,"Get Kenwood or Audiovox instead. The newer 2004 models that are coming out from Panasonic are no longer Sirius-ready. I confirmed that talking to their support line today.Trying to locate the necessary Panasonic receiver (CR-SRT100) to go with this head unit for Sirius service is near impossible now as it is no longer in any retail stores and has been discontinued. You might find it on Ebay or some obscure web sites overpriced, but you might also have problems getting other parts as well, such as a TERK SIR-SP splitter needed to hook up this hard-to-find CR-SRT100 receiver to an TERK SIR3 Sirius Satellite antenna that is equally impossible to find now in retail outlets.Panasonic already burned older 3DO customers with backing out of their M3 gaming console product when the Playstation took over the market. Don't let them do the same to you if you want Sirius radio support from them."
2,Funny but a fluff book,"I got this book to really learn something (no laughing :)) but it was just a funny read, and not much substance to it. I could not really follow the logic in a lot of places, and I had trouble explaining exactly what the book is about, although I liked the last very last 3 pages. Funny light-reading, if you have the time...."
4,Great,I saw this in an airport and noticed my job(quantum physicist) was one of the BS jobs. Let me tell you that this is the only business book I could ever stand to read. Nothing in this book is serious of course. Tahts what makes it good. Its all a big joke. Even the formula the author uses to rank the jobs is basically total BS.
5,"Good News, BAd News","ANYONE contemplating an engine rebuild or bolting on ""performance"" products should read this book first and also run the program. The practical presentation of the theory and science behind Mr. Otto's engines is excellent.The bad news is that the software included is from 1996 and runs in DOS. So, if you are rusty on working in DOS it can be frustrating at the beginning. But, the program is awesome to start with and the fact that it is relatively cheap means there is no reason to pass this up (unless you think you know everything there is to know about engines already.)The menus include configurations for popular engines plus you can manually enter configurations for everything else.As much as it irritates me that publihers contiue to sell items that are, in essence, a way to dump obsolete software, I have to admit this book is a deal. Buy it."
3,It works,"Thought this was the newer version of the software. It came with a 3.5"" floppy disk. Still trying to figure out wether i can load the program."
3,Almost Satisfied,"Figured the software would be up to date. It is not. It is 1996 floppy disc. Nobody has floppy disc drives anymore! That's the only bad part about this product. My husband still thanked me for getting him the book. Now, I gotta figure out how to get the info on the floppy converted to a CD so he can use the software. Contacted the company and still no word back from them. Maybe because of the holiday. (Happy Memorial Day!) I think if I would've seen somewhere written that the software was a floppy disc, I would not have bought it."
3,Ok for the price.,"Purchased for my son for Christmas. It can be a little hard to operate the mouth (cord is hard to pull). The dummy really should have a pole or something connected to the head that runs down the body. Everytime you you pull the string his head goes backwards. All in all, it's a decent 1st ventriloquist dummy for the money."
2,Disappointed...,"We ordered a ventriloquist dummy to be used in a Christmas drama. When we received it, we naturally took him out of the case to examine him and after doing so, we discovered that it was too difficult to make the mouth move with one hand. So we thought we would return him and get one that was a little better...an upgrade. Upon further research, we discovered the(extremely)""fine print"" that if the dummy was removed from the case AT ALL, we could not return it for a refund or even an exchange! I feel like this is absurd, seeing as how the only way we would know it didn't work the way we needed it to was to remove it from the case and try it."
2,lasts just long enough not to be covered by warranty,"I drive very seldomly, so I thought a CD player would last a long time. Wrong. After 13 months, this thing pooped out on me. I must have spent $180 in total, including installation, and it's no longer covered by warranty so I'm faced with the prospect of sinking even more money into it.Quite dissatisfied."
3,"Lovely, but itchy.","Works great, but is itchy and a bit uncomfortable. Makes you look good, though! If you like fishnet or bodystocking, good choice. Hopefully you won't be wearing it too long anyway, right?"
2,looks cheap,I underestimated how I would look in a stocking. It looks weird. Can't comment on the stocking itself...it's alright. But it looks pretty funky on me....not sexy at all.
3,"Fit good, but cheaply made","This fits well, but the neck part is elastic lace, which looks weird with the fishnet. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
2,Does not fit an IPOD Classic 160,"The description given by the seller of this product states it fits an ipod classic 160, not so. It is made for the ipod classic 30 and 40 G. It is a well made item, I just wish it fit my ipod. The problem is this; it's too fat for the classic to have a nice snug fit, the clear plastic screen is smaller than the ipods, and the openings on top don't align with ipod 160's. I don't see how I could send it back because you have to destroy the plastic packaging to get the case out. I think the seller doesn't know what this case really fits."
5,Every Prediction Came True Except for His Last One. Not Yet.,"I read this book about 20 years ago and everything he wrote came true except his last scenario has not played out yet. I hope for our sake it doesn't. Namely that our government goes broke, shuts off all the handouts, and I will not say the rest. Still worth reading."
4,Self-Teaching French,"In my 86th year I decided it was time to learn French since so many books I'd been reading use French to make the reader feel worldly. I went to the local senior center to take an introductory class. I was a complete flop until I found out about the book they were using. I immediately looked up the book in the used book section of Amazon.com. I found an excellent copy for a very inexpensive price. It looks as if it has never been used except by the passerby in the book store who pages through books before buying or not buying. Needless to say, I am fast becoming a show-off nuisance to my friends and family with my attempts at French conversation.I highly recommend the book for all concerned."
3,Only If you need a lot of practice exercises,"This book seems to be meant for folks who need a lot of practice exercises. The text is not detailed. So, if you already have some basic knowledge of French and need lots of practice exercises, then this book might be of use to you. If you absolutely have ""no"" knowledge of French, then I won't recommend this book to get started with. You might want to then try ""French Demystified""."
2,the book is full of pencil marks,"I bought the book rated as ""Good"" and didn't mention any marks, but the pencil marks are all over the book. The marks are so heavy that an erazer can not help."
3,French: A Self Teaching Guide,I found a few errors in the book. I am to use this book under the supervision of my teacher. I find that the exercises contain words and phrases that were not covered in the chapter. This makes it difficult to complete an assignment in under two hours. There has to be a book that is better suited to reviewing French. The book was assigned--there were no other options..
3,great knife but made in China,"I was wondering why this knife was so cheap and when I got it I read ""Made In China"" on the box and on the blade. I am disappointed in this from Buck and they should have mentioned it in the description. The images never show you clearly the mfg stamp. I was going to give it as a gift but after finding out it was made in China I decided to keep it and get a different knife that was made in the US. Still a nice knife like everyone says but China."
3,Cheap knife,"You get what you pay for. It's a little loose, sharp, lock open mechanism needed a little tinkering to make it lock open. I bought it to open boxes and leave laying around and not worry about it getting ripped from me. I'll just order another if it does get pocketed. I'd buy it again."
2,Not efficient,This knife is not very comfurtable in the hand and folded is very bulky and heavy. It is sharp and stylish though.
2,Needs Improvement,"I was really excited to receive this product, but it didn't turn out as expected. I ordered the chrome and aluminum, in order to do the checker board pattern, but the chrome came in 4 x 4's and the aluminum in 6 x 6's. Several pieces were also scratched from poor packaging. Sheet material can be bought with protective film, and for the plated/painted parts, they need to be wrapped with something. This could be a great product, but its quality and delivery kills it."
3,Do not stick to wall as well as past products,I have used this product in the past with excellent results This time I am having trouble with the tiles sticking to the wall. I think the tape is not as good. I had to buy extra tape
1,Listing is incorrect,Ordered these based on the listing size as 4 1/2 x 4 1/2 in size. These are 6x6. and come 16 in a pack instead of 24.
1,Backsplash Tiles,I just received the two sets of metal tiles. I paid $6.99 for shipping and handling. The sets were sent in a plastic bag with no padding. The tiles are very thin and delicate. Both of the sets were bent in the middle. None of them could be used. Im in the process of sending them back for a refund. A small box with some newspaper in it would have been great. I was excited about this order and had they not been damaged I think the backsplash would have been very nice. Very unhappy with the shipper.
4,look good!,These metal wall tiles look very good..It takes a few hours to put them up as a backsplash behind the cook top. The hardest part of installing was to cut and measure the side tiles. The mgf. needs to send extra two side tape squares as you will run out and I had to purchase an extra roll of 2side tape @ hardware store. After installing they look great..
3,save time when installing,These are very nice and an easy way to update decor but the adhesive strips do not hold and I had to redo everything using liquid glue. Use your own adhesive in the first place and save yourself some headaches.
1,Product not as described,"This is the description of the tiles I ordered. Based on the description, I ordered 2 sets.""Give your kitchen, bathroom or any room an instant update with these sleek metal wall tiles. They install easily with self-stick tabs and can be custom cut with scissors. Yet they're so durable, they won't crack, chip or stain. Great for making kitchen and bathroom back splashes, covering damaged areas or creating original patterns and artwork on your walls. No grout needed. Set of 24 four-inch-square tiles. Covers 3 sq. ft..""The tiles which were delivered were 6"" x 6"". Not 4"" x 4"".There were 16 of them in the box. Not 24.The enclosed directions said to cut the with tin snips. Not scissors.Additionally, the contents of one of the boxes was damaged. One of the edges of all the tiles was creased, deforming the edges and the face of the tiles."
5,Designed a kitchen around these tiles... TOTALLY Worth it!!,"These tiles are really good.I bought the Aluminum ones (NOT BRUSHED) which still came with a slight brushed pattern to them.I didn't use the sticky pads included, instead I used some thin tile cement from the hardware store.Completely installed my back-splash with the wife in around 7 hours (Used 8 boxes of these tiles)All the cutting was done with a decent pair of Kitchen scissors.We rotated the tiles 1/4 of a turn in an alternating pattern which gives the effect you see in most of the images shown in the product details.The effect is like you have two different types of tile pattern.Tile cement worked great and makes for a really solid tile. After reading a few reviews I think using the included sticky pads would probably make them more susceptible to being misshapen.All on all, great purchase, Whole kitchen back-splash completed for around one hundred and fifty dollars."
3,be aware of which seller you buy from! Not Same size product!,Ok the product itself turned out beautiful but I ran out and had to reorder. The first order came from carol wright gifts and the other came from DBROTH. They are not the same product. Carol Wrights are 4in and the DBROTH's are 6in. They should not be linked under the same item on amazon but should be seperate! Having said that. It was easy to put up and I used siding snips to cut it. I can't imagine using scissors. Word to the wise order all from same place and don't let it revert to another company.
3,Kindle version is LOADED with errors,"I'm 26% through with the book, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I like the unusual style and punctuation of Mr. Saramago's writing.But the Kindle version is LOADED with errors. Yes, you can tell they are errors even considering the unusual writing style. In fact, my experience leads me to think this is a sloppy scanning job.Am I right, publisher?Alice of Wonderland"
3,A little dull...,"I read Saramago's book, Blindness, and was so excited by it that I went out and bought All The Names. The book was very slow and about 1/2 way through I realzed I just plain didn't care about anyone or anything in the book. This is where I stopped. So, maybe the book ended well or got interesting but if it takes 100 pages to say something worthwhile, I'll take a pass (since there are so many other books out there).Even though I have mixed feelings about All The Names, I still feel that Saramago is a genius writer (but I'll admit I'm a little wary about picking up another of his works)."
4,worth the effort,"i enjoyed this, though it was a challenge to get used to the writing style (entire conversations become paragraphs going on for pages with only commas and capitals to separate)."
4,"Good, but I'm a bit confused.","This is the first book I read by this author. I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. However, the ending left me a bit confused. Oddly, I get the feeling as I get older it will make more and more sense. I have to ask though. If he hadn't started his search, with all the effects it had on the other characters. Would things have turned out different for her? I think you know what I'm talking about."
2,Pointless,"I normally enjoy reading Saramago's material, but I had a difficult time getting through ""All The Names."" Maybe I'm a little too dense to understand the underlying meaning to this novel, but, as a previous review mentioned, it took a long time to develop and when it finally reached a point of interest, some 100 pages later, it seemed to just drag even more.On a positive note, the writing was superb."
1,did not care for writing style,"This is a hard book to read because of lack of punctuation, quotation marks and paragraph indentations. Also I really could not find a point to this entire story. Mostly it is a recording of a man's thoughts, reflections and daydreams. I felt like I wasted my time with this one. It was very BORING!"
1,One big run-on sentence...,"I think this book has six, maybe seven periods in the whole book.Ok, so I might be exaggerating. However, I literally counted eight pages between two periods. This entire book is one long run-on sentence. If I had written this way in my college courses, I would have received an appropriate failing grade.Besides being incredibly difficult to read (because you keep wanting to insert a period) the plot of the book is nearly non-existent and develops slowly, and utterly fails to hold the reader's interest.I will NOT be recommending this novel to my friends or family. :-)"
1,0 stars.. Only gave it 1 because 0 wasn't an option,Awful awful awful... Did I say it was awful?situations that make up sol situations that make no sense. The acting is awful the writing is awful the movie is awful.that was 100 * more well done than this moviereal resolution or expla real resolution or explanation or understanding of why the characters had the attitudes they had.I actually fell asleep towards the end of the movie which is supposed to be the exciting part
2,What a waste of film,"this movie sucked so bad, its like watching a train wreck.and it just doesn't get any better as it goes onbut at least the train wreck finaly ends,and thank god, so did this movie"
5,a woman of her word,my first dvd was lost by the post officeimmediately ana got on it and sent a replacementa true woman of her wordhelene
2,This is a very depressing film,"This is a very depressing R rated movie. A family man who drives an armored truck is hijacked, his family is threatened, is made to participate in a robbery, and then shot in the head. He survived but was left with mental and emotional problems. He acts strangely. This affects his family and the FBI begin to believe that he was an inside man for the robbery. He stumbles upon some information and feels that the FBI isn't doing all it can to find who did the robbery and shot him, and he decides to go after the criminals himself."
5,Great stuff!,"I am currently pregnant with my second baby in as many years (surprise!) and got pretty bad stretch marks with my first. Unfortunately, as soon as my belly started to grow, it seems that the stretch marks decided to pick up where they left off and are now almost halfway between my belly button and breasts. I saw this oil and decided to purchase it, and I'm glad I did!It absorbs very quickly, smells great, and keeps my belly and sides super moisturized. Even though I didn't help prevent my stretch marks (as I already had them) it has made them appear a little bit lighter in color and that itchy, tight feeling has all but disappeared! I love this stuff!"
4,"38 weeks, no stretch marks yet!","I'm not sure if it is due to genetics, the massive amounts of water I drink, or this oil, but I'm 38 weeks pregnant with a huge baby and I have only a couple small stretch marks on my hips. I haven't been using the oil there. I also have had NO itching! This product smells great coming out of the bottle and when freshly rubbed on, but it kind of makes my clothes smell like I've been working in the kitchen of a restaurant... So I only use it at night, and wash my pajamas on a double-rinse cycle in hot water."
3,"Interesting smell, not sure about efficacy","Don't love the smell and this is definitely greasy. I like that the ingredients are all-natural. I have developed mild stretch marks so not sure about the efficacy- from what I read, if someone is genetically predisposed to stretch marks no amount of lotion will prevent them."
3,"I love it, but my clothes don't","I love the smell.I love the feel.My only complaint is that even if I let it sit on my uncovered skin for half an hour it still ends up on my underclothes. Am I supposed to leave it on for a while and then wipe it off? It leaves residue on my clothes that I didn't notice until I couldn't figure out why my undershirts were coming out of the washer/dryer with the smell of oil on them... not the pretty smell of the oil when you put it on, but like an oil base smell that isn't pleasant. I have used the oil less frequently just because I don't want my clothes to be ruined. I guess I just never thought that it would be a problem."
3,Does not prevent stretch marks.,"First of all I just want to say that if you're going to get stretch marks, you're going to get them. No cream or oil will prevent them. I used this religiously (twice a day) from the starting of my second trimester. I am 37 weeks now and gotten pretty bad stretch marks. So to sum it up, this product does not prevent stretch marks.Overall, the oil kept my skin pretty nice and smooth and it really helped with the itching. Putting it on, it smells incredible but I do agree with other users that it leaves this stale smell on your clothes. Overall, it's a pretty good product but I probably won't purchase it again."
4,"Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil, 4-Ounce Bottle","Light, citrus-floral scent that never gets old. I try to remember to use it everyday, and I have very sensitive skin so I've noticed the days I do use it I get a little red rash but it actually doesn't itch so it doesn't really bother me. I would give it 5 stars but I'm only 5 months pregnant so I can't guarantee that it does what it's supposed to-- no stretch marks yet though!"
5,"Brillant - feels good, smells great, & no stretch marks!","I used this product every morning and night when I was pregnant with my daughter. It has a lovely scent and was very soothing as a stretch oil, massage oil, and it even helped with dry skin on my arms. I highly recommend this and all the Earth Mama Angel Baby products - especially the nipple butter and bottom cream."
5,It Actually Worked,It Actually worked. I used this starting at about 12 weeks and only once a day due to the cost. I was large by the end of the pregnancy (measuring two weeks ahead)and I had no stretch marks. This was recommended to me by a friend who used it and also had no stretch marks.Update: Second pregnancy and it completely worked again. I did not put it on my hips and saw some stretch marks there. There was no stretch marks where I had put it.
5,The Best Belly Treatment,"This is my first pregnancy, and my skin has suffered - I'd used all the common, well-advertised products for my belly, but nothing took away the horrid itch and the disgusting flaky skin. This product is phenomenal; it's non-greasy, has completely erased all itchy and dry skin, and smells great. It was originally a gift, but I am now sold on the brand - a MUST for pregger women!"
3,32 weeks pregnant and stretch marks already,"I've been using the stretch oil every morning after I shower and once again at night since I was 12 weeks pregnant. I am now 32 weeks and I have noticed my first stretch marks. I was surprised by the other reviews because I barely gained weight during my pregnancy and most people think I am at most 5 months pregnant and I still developed stretch marks. While the oil did not ward off stretch marks, it did moisturize my skin and I haven't had to deal with an itchy belly which many of other women in my birth club seem to suffer from. I like the smell of the oil, but it's a bit greasy and you have to wait till it dries up before you put your clothes on (I ruined a few blouses at first). I am going to continue using the oil (this is my third bottle) throughout my pregnancy and possibly afterwards to keep my skin moisturized."
4,Earth Mama Oil,"So far no stretch marks and 21 weeks in. That just could be because I haven't really started to grow yet but I am remaining optimistic. I really like this stuff. It makes my tummy and hips nice and smooth and keeps my skin soft and hydrated. I only wish there was more in one bottle. It is quite small and goes by fast. Other than that, so far so good. Catch me in another 2 months ;-)"
1,Extremely Itchy,"My wife used this product for over a week and had to switch to 100% cocoa butter because of extreme & uncontrollable itchiness that prevented her from sleeping. I do not know for sure if the itchiness was caused by this product or not, but after two days of switching to 100% cocoa butter so far and her itchiness has deminished substancially. If the itchiness disappears after a week, I am returning this product and giving it a zero. If it still itchies, then it might just be a pregnacy thing and I will upgrade the rating to 3 stars. I will post another update in about 10 days.UPDATE 4/27/11: My wife has been pure cocoa butter for a few weeks now and the itchiness is not that noticeable anymore. This may be a great product for most people but not for my wife's skin."
1,Can't tolerate the smell.,"I can't comment on the effectiveness of this product against stretch marks, because at 14 weeks pregnant I can't stand to use this product any longer due to the smell. I would say I have slightly above-average nausea during pregnancy, and I can smell this product on me all day long. It is nauseating. I have avoided using it just for a break from the smell...so what's the point? Right out of the bottle it smells fine, but after a bit it smells like old, rancid oil. The rancid oil smell has persisted on clothes that I have put through the washer - twice! I can smell it in my bedding, everything. I am going back to the product I used with my last two pregnancies - Revitol. For those with sensitive stomachs/noses, this is not the product for you."
4,good product,"I'm 23 weeks pregnant, I use Bella B Tummy Honey Butter for my belly and Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch oil for my breasts, so far so good and no stretch marks. I'm getting big fast, so i know my skin is stretching and i get itchy some times but the oil and honey butter both have helped w my skin issues and again no stretch marks so far...:)"
4,Nice smell/feel,"This oil has a very pleasant smell unlike many other stretch mark oil products. It goes on very smoothly, and absorbs very well. I have tried many stretch mark products, and would recommend this one."
3,Not the best on stretch marks,I got this because of the reviews and the price. Ive been using it for about a month but I havent seen any changes in my strech marks. It does make my skin really soft though so Ive actually started using it on my legs and arms and found something else for my tummy. (Bella B Tummy Honey) But everybody is different so I wouldnt tell others not to try it. Especially for the price.
2,Good but smelly...,"I bought the oil and also the cream. The texture and the consistence of the products are really good, but the smell is strong and not pleasant."
3,It makes your clothes smelly,I'm not sure if it even works but it has ruined a few of my night gowns.The smell is nice at first but you have to wait for the oil to dry before you wear anything or you will get old oil smell on your clothes.
2,Doesn't Work.,"I had high expectations for this product because it had many good reviews but I'm rather disappointed with it.. It's VERY greasy and will make your clothes stick no matter how long you let it dry, and as soon as you put a shirt on it will just rub it off. Also as far as stretch mark prevention goes, DOESN'T WORK! I thought it was doing the trick up until I was about 7 1/2 months along and believe me they came with a vengeance.. The only perk is it really does have a nice fragrance but that's as far as the benefits go."
2,Cheap Bubble gum Smell.,"I'm not sure this is good or not. I just used only 2 times. I bought oil and body butter. Both of this products Smell just like cheapBubble gum. I think I don't want to buy any of earth mama angle products. I don't want to be sting like Bubble gum,.:("
5,I am so glad I found this product!!!,"I ordered a bottle of Earth Mama Angel Baby Stretch Oil 2 weeks ago and have been using it twice a day ever since. It smells wonderful and is not greasy like other oils like I expected it to be. It is very light, and being that it comes in a 4 oz. bottle, I can tell I am going to go through it pretty fast. I have already ordered another bottle! I am 22 weeks pregnant, and I can't quite explain it, but I just have a strong feeling that it is going to prevent stretch marks for me :)"
2,Didn't work for me,"I love this line of products ..especially the baby body wash. But this one just didn't work for me. I used it through my whole pregnancy every morning after showering in ample amount. I had my baby 2 weeks ago and now that my skin is getting lax I can see that I had a few existing stretch marks from my first pregnancy that are now Deeper and Darker, plus quite a few new stretch marks. A real disappointment. I used cheap old palmers in my first pregnancy and got much better results. I switched to earth mama because its organic and better ingredients. Bottom like..it didn't work. Now I need to find a good stretch mark remover!...any recommendations?"
5,"great product, wonderful smell","mild, light floral smell that is very pleasant, not irritating--from someone who buys mostly fragrance free products and hates almost all perfumes."
4,nice smelling not 'too' oily,"I've been using this product daily for about 3 months now and I like it alot. It almost instantly relieves any itchiness on my 5month pregnant belly and soothes my old marks as they once again fill out. It smells slightly of oranges (like almost all EMAB products do) but its a very light mellow scent, not as strong as the happy mama spray or lotion. I also like that the oil is easily absorbed and doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy for more than a min before you can touch things again I'm reordering as I'm about 2/3 through my 4oz bottle and I don't want it to run out. I use a liberal coating on my belly about 1-3 times each day. oh and the small sample bottle is really hard to manage but the pump on this 4oz bottle works very well although it is different than the picture shows. It has a small square opening at the top and there is not a stick protruding from the pump."
4,So Far So Good,"I've been using this since we found out I was pregnant. I'm 21 weeks now, but my belly started measuring 18 weeks from the time I was 12 weeks. As you can imagine my belly grew large, fast. No stretch marks though. We'll see what happens around month 7.It smells good, not too heavy and doesn't stain my clothes. Just make sure to watch your sun exposure after using it. I used it on my breast and got a bit of a burn where the oil was applied when i wore a cleavage bearing blouse."
3,I expected more...,"Remember the series Playmakers on ESPN? That's pretty much what they modeled this game after. They kept some of the WWE stlyed hits (Powerbomb, bulldogs ect)The game play is ok, it takes way to long to load though. The editing players feature is kind of nice although limited.I don't care for some of the music/language in this game, and the ""blood"" at times seems to be a bit uncalled for. I still would have bought it, but I'll probably trade it in as soon as I beat it."
5,this is the best blitz game you'll ever play,don't believe these other people they don't know what their talking about i own the game and it does not take 12 mins. to load it takes a min. or two.the game has great sound and the players look so real. so don't bleieve all this B.S. these other guys say hope this helps you and points you in the right direction.
3,Not what i thought it would be......,This game is fun but i thought it would be alot better than this.First off the graphics are okay but not he best.Its fun to break tackles and break bones in this game with big hits!But the loading period is way to long.Its not like Madden or your typical football game in a way its like street.Please RENT THIS GAME before you buy it and waste money on it.Luckily i rented it and saved 40 or 50 dollars.But if you loved the old Blitz games like i did you should love this one as well.
5,Blitz is da best,first off if you actually time the loading your a nerd.blitz is just awesome I mean think about it what other game allows u to beat your opponent sensless with his own helmet.if u dont like this game your crazy.the multiplayer is decent.if u play your friends i suggest you use the NY Nightmare.(for people who want no challenge from opponents.i mean i use either them or the bearcats.the bearcats only have 1 good player9 Bruno Bataglia) use your unleashed w/him. and campaign mode has possibly the richest story mode ever
3,"Good, but needs second edition","I loved the game but when there was no second making (next season) I immediately sold it off. No need to own a game that when you see something cool, it will never be there again."
3,Blitz the League,LOAD TIME...be prepaired to wait! Other then that it's a fun game that keeps you playing.
1,Garbage.,"Can't believe I bought this one because of the hype surrounding it. I was expecting hard hits, and such. But I was also expecting atleast some decent gameplay to go with it. Everytime I see LT in the commercials claiming this is how ""real football is played"", I think sellout. How can a former NFL player say real football is 7 on 7, and most tackles are closelines, and dropkicks? Haven't seen that game on tv yet. Anyways, this is a really bad simulation even for an arcade style game."
4,Fun game; don't have all the time in the world.,"I love this game for what it is. You cannot expect this to be anything like Madden but it is still a fun game. Injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced. Fast Paced: something I cannot say about the loading. This game is the slowest loading game I have ever played. It actually took three minutes for it to load one time. Get this game, provided that you can wait a little bit."
5,What a neat idea...,"My son received the ""M is for Mitten: A Michigan Alphabet"" for his birthday. I thought the book was so neat, so I ordered one for my neice and nephew who live in Illinois. The illustrations are beautiful."
1,untraceable,"unacceptable, the whole last part is messed up and I did not want the trouble of sending it back and paying postage, this was a waste of my money"
3,Taut thriller,"I can understand the mixed reviews for Untraceable. While I found it suspenseful and graphic, it was also difficult to feel cathartic or uplifted by the film, which is generally dark. Sure, there are far darker and heavier movies, but the subject matter here was somewhat realistic in its outlook. We live in a sensationalized world, and that is the premise of the film.Diane Lane brings her overwrought anguished look to the film and for once, she's really put through the wringer in this episode. Well crafted and well made, some tweaks could have made this a better movie. Diane Lane is basically going Jodie Foster in her version of Silence of the Lambs in cyberspace for this..."
2,Only worth watching because of Diane Lane,"Diane Lane is the only reason to watch this movie. As an actor, she knows how to create a meat pie out of potatoes. Unfortunately, she is also the reason why this 'trip down gore lane' can pass itself off as a serious film at first glance. It is, however, just another exercise in how far a filmmaker can push the envelope on the theme of cruelty, mayhem and murder. The only favorable point I can possibly give it is that the producers did not shy away from using an actress who, thankfully, is not trying to hide her age and is accepting the cycle of life with a grace that makes her even lovelier."
4,Untraceable,Untraceable is a must watch for all the tech fans. What happens when the experts start being traced by a tech murderer? Who in the government will protect us? This thriller combines the reality that our use of technology can get out of hand at times. Our freedom of speech while free does come with a price. Is someone watching what you do on your computer? Do you really think you are UNTRACEABLE?!
2,Silence of the Lambs It Ain't!,"Eh. So-so thriller with a really bland perfomance by Diane Lane and probably nobody else you've ever heard of. (MaryBeth Hurt, maybe, but she really just sits around and sighs). The deaths are fairly gruesome if that's what your looking for but the plot is predictable and it lacks any real energy."
1,Horrible,Nothing more than another torture porn movie. It's disgusting to think people actually enjoy watching the suffering of humans and animals as entertainment. I was expecting a good conquers evil thriller and instead I lost an hour and half of my life to trash. I'm disappointed Diane Lane attached herself to this movie; I've enjoyed much of her previous work.
1,Not for Cat or animal people,If you are a cat person to preserve your sanity do not watch this movie. At minimum skip the first 15 to 20 minutes.
2,B Grade Thriller Which Almost Pulls It Off,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie. But with the first scene in which the killer takes the life of a kitten, I figured it would get even more disturbing as the movie progressed. I was correct. Interesting concept nonetheless. The son of a man who commits suicide avenges his father's death which was exploited by the media. He does this by selecting people involved in reporting his father's suicide and proceeding to torture them for all to see via his web site. The more people who watch, the quicker the death. There's social commentary being made but first you need to get through the creative methods of killing people. There is an ironic twist at the end which I'll leave for you to see and ponder. Not a bad movie and certainly not for the squeamish. BnB Beatles Depot"
4,Interesting Cyber-Thriller,"Diane Lane stars as FBI Agent Jennifer Marsh who finds herself dealing with the unthinkable. A sadistic killer is torturing his victims and posting it on the internet. The pace at which his victims die depends on the number of visitors to the site.""Untraceable"" starts off slow and dull, but the movie quickens with the same pace at which the victims meet their demise. As original as a story ""Untraceable"" is, it slightly resembles ""Saw"" and ""Silence of the Lambs."" See if you can piece together the puzzle before it unravels. Great cyber-thriller, its worth a watch. 3.5 out of 5."
3,saw look-a-like does okay,"This movie was suprisingly good. Diane Lane plays a cyber crimes investigator who, along with Colin Hanks, come up against the greatest tech felon that they've ever seen. He's killing people live on the internet, and using the traffic to the site to expedite the murders. The suspense is kept steady through the entire film, and the plot is revealed a piece at a time and will leave you guessing. The story begins to fall apart slightly towards the end, but it's strong until that point. The violence in this film is similar to ""torture flicks"" (like Saw etc.). Definitely not for kids."
2,"Not exactly an ""edge of the seater""","The plot is great.Serial Killer. Not a new theme but always worthy of a look see.He, or she, kidnaps the victim and tortures them on streaming internet whilst the police and FBI watch. The morbidity arises when the victim is hastened to his demise according to the number of viewers clicking on.Diane Lane heads a good cast.It is for the most part predictable. No real thrills or chills. No wows when the killer is identified. Character interaction is blandly held to a minimum. No twists or turns.It's an ok flick up to the finale.The final scene is annoying. Extremely so.The viewer deserved a better wrap-up."
1,Unwatchable,"I love Diane Lane in Hollywoodland and Unfaithful but not in this! What I didn't like about Untraceable was it copied elements of Saw and Seven. It's like, don't screw with good movies, than it cheapens them and you get sick of watching the very movies they tried to copy. I also didn't like how they chose to use a kitten for the seriel killers first victim. What??!! Why couldn't they use a hooker or a bum, why an innocent kitten? This movie repulses me."
2,Where's Hannibal?,"One of the raves of this film was something along the lines of "" 'Silence of the Lambs' for the internet generation"".PUH-LEASE.The villain of this movie doesn't hold a candle to Hannibal. This guy would be an appetizer to him."
2,"Cool concept, poor execution","(No pun intended).The idea was original but that's about as far as it goes. The plot is contrived and the suspense completely forced. Many parts of the movie made no sense and the resolution was predictable and unsatisfying. I thought it especially lame that we are expected to believe that this mentally-ill, 20-something dropout is a computer genius and master-criminal. Good grief...Watch ""Mr. Brooks"" instead; it's 50 times better.So NOT recommended."
3,Neat Crime thriller...,"Many 'reviews' here are very misleading in comparing this to Saw, Silence of the Lambs, Hostel, porn, etc. This is a neat detective thriller about finding and stopping an obviously demented killer. Unsuitable for pre-teens, it's rated R for violence, images of torture and some f-words. There is no nudity and certainly no under the cover action, so why the porn reference? It's not great, but worthy of a rental. I liked it."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Just a couple things that came to mind when I was watching this. First I want to say that the premise was somewhat unique in which the internet users had a hand in the murders and I thought the acting was good.What I couldn't quite comprehend was that an agent would keep all her curtains wide open at nighttime when she knows she's facing the street, and when she's running back to her vehicle with her gun drawn she doesn't look in the back seat. It's these little things that ruin a movie. To me anyway."
3,not impressed but...,"Here's a new crime: kidnap someone, and broadcast that person's killing online; his/her fate is based on the number of visitors the site has. Diane Lane is an FBI agent who tries desperately to catch this vicious killer... Soon it'll become personal.No great acting here. Diane Lane and Colin Hanks are, unlike the rest of the cast, a notch above in their performances.Not too predictable, but something was missing all through the movie.Not a bad viewing though. The worst scenes are when the method of killing the victims is shown, and it's different every time, so that's at least interesting."
2,It is bad...,This movie was bad and the story line was bad. Unfortunately the couple of scene was horrible. Anyway this movie was out of joy. It's complicated.the story was too short. It isn't cool movie.
3,"Untraceable, but not Untraceable enough","This movie is a by-the-numbers thriller that borrows extensively from ""Silence of the Lambs"". Every plot point you can see coming from a mile away, and the film seems almost re-written from ""Slilence's"" original script. The murders are pretty gruesome and the effects are pretty good for these. My wife had to bail out on the film less than a third of the way in. Diane Lane is fine as the sensible FBI person. I don't want to give away any spoilers here, but lets just say you won't be terribly surprised by what happens. Sound is pretty good, and the picture quality is fine, but it was heavily doctored for grain and color for cinematic effect."
4,Engaging Thriller.....,"I enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish.... Nice plot with good acting my cast members. It was a bit slow over all and had three predictable parts at the ending, but otherwise a good thriller."
3,all in the name of voyeurism,"Diane Lane plays an FBI agent, Jennifer Marsh, specializing in cyber crimes. Pretty soon, this FBI division are called to investigate deaths that are broadcasted via the Internet...[...] Site hits increase with each death episode. Someone is kidnapping people and killing them online. And the more site hits, the faster the victims die.You would think that in the name of humanity, people would cease from visiting the site. However, it is our curiosity to check out the site despite what consequences may be.However, this case becomes personal when the killer intrudes Jennifer's personal life. And like a moth to a flame, Jennifer finds herself in a mess without backup.*Untraceable* is like a spawn of *Saw*, *Copycat*, *Silence of the Lamb* and *The Net*. A good thriller worth watching."
2,Weak and predictable plot,"Diane Lane in an uninspiring role as a cyber cop. Like this hasn't been done before on TV by one of the myriad crime shows. Acting was pretty bad. As I watched the movie, I kept saying to myself ""I know what's going to happen next."" It was comical hearing them referring to trojans, netbots, and all the cyber mumbo-jumbo. I was really impressed (he said, tongue in cheek). Because the storyline became so predictable, you don't care for the victims. Just a stupid movie."
4,Untraceable - Movie,"This is a great suspense movie. If you like suspense, drama and action you will enjoy this movie. I shaw the movie in the theater and purchased the Blue Ray addition for my collection."
4,america's critic,"untraceable was execelent great acting story was neat, i really enjoyed this 1, i like the killing scenes they were prettty cool, all in all i reccomand this one rent it or purchase it on sale."
1,Great date movie!,"His dad was murdered by a kitten? I'll just say that this is not my idea of entertainment. But hey, live and let--oh, sorry."
1,3 Words- FIRE YOUR AGENT,"This is a complete fantasy movie. Completely.Where the hell is a 20-year-old kid going to get chemicals like this and then these elaborate get-ups and devices and then set them up rigged to go off based on how many people are hitting his web site? My god, most boys his age can't even perform proper oral sex let alone mastermind this kind of serial killing. It's just complete fantasy.The kid from `Running with Scissors' plays the bad guy and wow; fire your agent, please. Diane Lane has no excuse. This is just bad behavior on her part. Bad behavior.When I die, I will defiantly be talking to Whomever is in charge about getting the time I wasted watching this film added back onto my life as a matter of principle."

4,companion for the sports enthusiast,"I was surprised to learn that women could not compete at all in the ancient Olympics and that married women couldn't even attend as spectators. For some reason, unmarried girls were allowed in to the Stadium, to admire the bods of naked young men! There are lots of other fun facts in this book -- I wish there had been a bit more about the women's competitons in Sparta, but overall a great book for anyone into either sports or history this summer (and personally I think I'll be watching the Olympics on TV rather than braving Athens!) It's a fast, fun read."
4,The Naked Olympics,"It was an interesting read. I like the way the author utilized research to tell a story, while imagining what it would really look like. Also, the occasional connect to modern Olympics made the reader think about today's sport along with the origin of sport. It made history fun!"
4,A Good Read,"The more books I read about ancient history, the more I come to realize that the best ones are NOT written by historians! Archaeologist Tony Perrottet does a great job describing life in Ancient Greece and the evolution of sport in western society.I picked this up right after the '04 games in Athens, still in the grip of Olympics fever. But don't wait until '08 to read this wonderful book."
2,The Prince of Pretentious does his Volume II,"There is something so painfully self-serving about the author and the way that he writes, that it is very difficult to get very far into the book-- it has to do with the style, the way things are worded, then stupid little expressions and most of all, the unbearably pretentious overall feel. Look for shameless self-promotion by the author all summer long."
4,Not enough about the nudity,"I have always been intrigued with the fact that the ancient Greeks competed in athletics without a stitch of clothing on. I was eagerly looking forward to this book, and enjoyed the glimpse into a time gone by. But there was not enough said about the nude aspects of the games. The author offers suggestions as to how the tradition was started, but not enough about what it felt like. What if a man was in less than prime physical condition, or if he was embarrassed about how his nude body compared to others? Even in the locker rooms of today, those who are well-endowed freely walk around in the nude with a swagger that those who are not as gifted do not. I wanted to hear more about the social aspects of the nudity of the games. For a book that is titled ""The Naked Olympics"", it could have explored the ""naked"" bit more."
5,Worth It!,"I bought this plush Pegasus back in '98. Paid way more than I should have, but he's gorgeous! Of my Pegasus collection, he is one of my favorites - mostly b/c he's so darn cute!Soft plush body w/fuzzy faux-fur type hair; wings and horn are irridecent plastic material. Eyes are plastic, non-chip paint and his gem is plastic & the receiver for the IRS.When triggered by IRS or squeezed around the middle, Pegasus will flap his wings and say (x2) ""Yume wo tsukande, Chibimoon"" (""Grasp your dreams, Chibimoon""). The noise from the wings' gears is minimal, but you do still hear them. [Runs on 2 AA batteries, I believe.]The rarity of this toy makes him rather pricey, but that's probably his only drawback. As long as you go in expecting to pay $80-150 for him, you should be ok. ^~^' Any Pegasus collector worth their salt will want to get this guy any way they can!"
5,Battleships,This is an excellent reference book if you're into this subject. Well worth the price since books of this caliber are few and far between.
5,Rockin,"Except for the inane Flaming Lips song, this album is great. Rose Hill Drive's version of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates' ""Shakin' All Over"" is the hardest rocker on there, a definite departure from the original. ""Mr Sandman"" is a must-hear, also harder than the original but totally groovy. The Cake song is also awesome as is the Walkmen cover. You will not regret getting this disc."
5,over all great,"Even though devante isnt a house hold name yet,Devante get 5 stars because he made a very versitile cd.And no he has no relation to devante of jodeci. He has a lil bit of every sound in this cd. Stand out tracks are#2beautiful#4 things you like-great song he sound like montell jordan on that one#5 like I do-nice bump n grind beat#7 7 days-nice dance track8-soul sista -nice neo soul type song9-summer love-nice neo soul type song10-assumtions- reminds me of none of your friends business by ginuwine12-gona be alright-nice neo soul type songANd thats why you should buy this.[...]"
5,Excellent NIC - W2K8 R2 recognized it immediately,"Plug and play - W2K8 already has NIC driver loaded, got it up and running in less than 2 minutes."
5,Works great. Home lab ESX server recognized it.,"I bought it to use in a SUPERMICRO MBD-X9SCM-F-O Micro ATX Intel Xeon E3 Server Motherboard. The machine is set up with ESXi 5.1 and this model of NIC is recognized by the mobo and VMWare.It's fast, you can bond it, and I have not had any issues with it whatsoever. I'm actually running a total of 4 of these NICs on the home lab server."
5,love them,my boots look better them the picture. they wear very well. and look very good on my feet. harly- davidson have good boots if you buy these boots you will be very happy with them.
4,"Very interesting and readable, but more sociology than natural history","This book covers man's relationship with the Timber Rattlesnake in Massachusetts, with strong coverage of the park which is the rattlesnakes one remaining stronghold in the area. It is NOT a natural history book, though oddly it gave the clearest brief exposition of the evolution of rattlesnakes I ever read. I enjoyed reading the book thoroughly, and learned a lot about the historical relations of Boston residents with nature and especially rattlesnakes. Oddly, I didn't learn much about rattlesnakes that was new to me!Mostly worth reading if the history of the Boston area is of interest to you, or if you have a special interest in the natural history of the region. Others can read it for enjoyment, but won't find it astoundingly useful."
3,Fun Online fisrt person shooter,"Fun game, when i played on my friends computer. Sadly it does not work on my newer laptop. Only buy if you have a gaming desktop with brand name graphics card."
4,Really good only with Project Reality!,"The game itself is fun for a couple of weeks. But it looses its glamour after some time.Than it's time for Project Reality!This is a modification and can be downloaded for free. It is a complete transformation of the game - add's realism and teamwork, new factions and game types. And it never gets boring! I play it for almost two years now!"
1,didn't work on my computer,"i couldn't get it to load on my computer, and i don't even know why because my computer is pretty new i've never had a problem with any other game. i called tech support and they were no help. i'm mad that i can't return it either."
4,excellent,"Wow. This game is really something. It isnt really much of a comparison to 1942 since the gameplay action is so much smoother and better. Its not the type of game that you would get sick of either, you can play endlessly online. I really want this!"
1,Don't believe the other reviews,"I purchased this game and excitedly installed it which took nearly 10-20 minutes because of all the addons and next buttons you have push. Then load it up and create my ID, refresh the server list, find a server I wanted to try out and bam ""Invalid CD-Key"".... Why did it let me install it then. 6 reinstalls and many communications with EA games later and nothing has changed except how mad I have become. Also a quick search for Invalid CD-key"" in google reveals that I am not alone. Beware if you buy this game you might just be stuck with it."
1,Piece of crap!!,"This game, will not run on my PC, even through it meets the ""minium"" system requirements. Even after I called to ask for assistance I got a run around from the technical support people... first they blamed my video card, then they blamed the cpu....etc. What was happening simply, the thing would close back to desktop. No freaking fix yet!! Sheesh!!"
1,"Great gameplay, complete ripoff backstage","I like the gameplay, but having to run gamespy, download updates through fileplanet, etc. (Which you really have to do) makes it the best freeware on the planet... but you have to pay for it... get America's Army instead, youll spend like 10 hours finding your friends, like in this game, however AA is free.The disadvantages of setting up, requiring a CD to run the game (bad for laptop users) and online play being run by gamespy instead of through an internal engine, makes you want to throw the game at the developers face."
2,No Co-Op mode - deduct 3 stars,"Battlefield 2 is an excellent game. It has wonderful graphics, plays smoothly, and has great maps and gameplay. However, it is missing the part of the Battlefield series that made it so much fun: Co-op mode. All of the other Battlefield games allowed you to set up a game with 64 players and fill them with Bots. This way you could have a small LAN party, and fill the ""empty seats"" with 60 or so characters. This was a major oversight by EA and they need to come out with an update, or I will not purchase Battlefield 3.Also, the music from Battlefield Vietnam was excellent. I think they should have implemented a way to play music while in vehicles in this version. One last thing: there is no way to play single player mode with more than 16 bots."
1,"Fun when it works, but very buggy.","I waited to buy this game until recently. Now that I have bought it I wish I would not have. Even after the latest patches this game is still not stable. It shouldn't have been released in this condition.Battlefield 2 has all the ingredients for a great FPS. It is a lot of fun to play when it works. Teamwork, different roles as a player, and the ranking system are all great ideas. Unfortunately they are thrown together in an unstable package.Maybe EA will finally get things straightened out in the upcoming 1.3 patch. It will only be the 7th patch released for this game. Who could expect it to work yet?I would suggest buying something else. Why pay the price for what is essentially a Beta game?"
2,much ado about nothing,difficult to load needed a patch from electronic arts that was never mentioned. It only plays from a connected server which can be never ending to connect.Extremely complex and difficult to play... Don't recommend but to the most experienced and dedicated gamer
4,A change of pace.,"After the fast-paced intensity of Call of Duty 2, this game took a little getting used to. he key thng is that this game is geared toward multiplayer mode, and there is no campaign. And because it allows the operation of any vehicle on a map, this means that the maps are generally quite large, and thus getting around on foot can take quite a long time without help. Still, despite the loose feeling and the lack of CoD-like intensity, this game is very fun, I love it. I recommend it for any lover of FPS games.One note, it has VERY high system reqs. Make sure you have a very good computer for playing this on."
1,Crashes windows 7,"This game crashed my PC running Win7 sp1. Unfortunately EA has not updated this game, it seems to be a problem with PunkBuster. Don't buy."
5,Pretty good game,"It's not a bad game, online play isn't quite as fun as BFV but, the rank system makes being dominant in this actually worthwhile.Constant updates make this game better as well, with removal of glitches, new maps, reducing and increasing the effectiveness of weapons, as well as the addition of the Special Forces mod, it never gets boring and no one weapons kit will ever be so dominant that no one plays with anything else."
4,"Pretty good, may need a new computer","I am a big time gamer and when I got this game I realized that my computer could definetly do it, but it required an advanced video card as well as a good RAM. So get this game but make sure you read the system requirements before you buy it, because your computer might not hold it."
4,"Best multiplayer war game ever,","The realism, the squad system, the necesity of teamwork to win, its an excelent game, gut a few bugs, a few glitches that can be anoying from time to time... but if the machine is capable enough (high system requirements...) you should have smooth and VERY FUN gameplay, and the rank system (not a new feature, but good enough), all kind of war vehicles. I cant recommend it more..."
4,WW 2 fps,"Fun Game, new weapons, maps and vehicles. Single player is short. Either that or I can't figure out how to get to maps other than the ones shown. Multiplayer must have more maps. Haven't done that, yet though."
3,I could not play online....,I was exited to buy this game but unfortunately its a used one and the serial key is not included so i have to find a serial key from someone i know and i could not go online to play multiplayer...
1,DO NOT BUY,"I looked at the requirements. All systems are good, all needs are aquired. I got everything and still the stupid game wont start. do not buy this game unless you feel like losing 50 bucks or if you are able to return it when the box is already opened. I have a high tech graphic card and all that crap and yet the game enters a full black screen and returns to the desktop. Far Cry works but BF2 doesnt. EA must be lazy about their customers. Trust Ubi-Soft for the better games. If the same glitch has happened to you and u have fixed it, plz tell me how: AIM-djnumark33Email- smum3316@yahoo.comX box live- LtSmum3316"
1,Better have a good computer,"i gave this game only one star not because it isn't fun, i'm sure it is, i did because i never got a chance to play it. the system requirements are way to high for most peoples computers even mine which i thought was fairly good. probably the biggest thing is the requirement for the graphics card, it says it will run on a 128MB card but it is only compatible with the newest cards almost all of which are 256MB or higher so don't be fooled. If you have a new computer with alot of ram and a good graphics card have fun with it, if your not sure double check that your system meets the requirements so you don't end up wasting your money and getting a game that won't work at all like I did."
1,battlefield 2,The game would not load on my PH MC m470n. I contacted AE and was told it would not work with ATI Radeon 9200MCE card. They also were willing to refund my money thru Amazon.MontiePS. Was unable to send without rating. There is no rating I was not able to enjoy the game.
2,The Servers Suck,"Well, if the official servers ran adequately the game would be nearly as good as others have described.But the reality of the game is that EA has not provided enough support for the game so the game is beset by horrendous lag in the instances you can find a non-full server to play on.The connection front end is something out of the 80's with no BUDDY LISTS, no functioning filters, and crashes half the time you ask it to refresh. It'll take you a half hour of attempts to log into a server that allows you to earn rank, then you'll be sickened by the lag and usually disconnected before the mission plays out.Wait for a patch or for the game to come out on console. Currently the game is more frustrating than fun."
3,Battlefield 2,"Battlefield 2 is a complicated game for a novice, like me. I'm getting more familiar with it each time I play it."
5,5 Stars is For When This Game Actually Runs,"This game is fantastic don't get me wrong. Gameplay-wise, it's not a disappointment on any level. I do have the kind of machine that can run it though, so maybe if I had a less powerful machine I wouldn't think so, I don't know....ANYWAY, my only complaint/warning is that this game at its current build is incredibly BUGGY!!! In terms of it's startup and it's talon-like grip it takes on your computer. So be prepared to spend half the time totally frustrated and the other half playing the best fps yet. Good luck fellow gamers!"
5,Outstanding!!!,"No significant complaints, very fun challenging game. Okay, complaint: single player not very good, but if you're buying this game its for the online multi anyway."
4,It's Well Worth The Price,"This is one of the best FPS games I've played. The graphics are good, and the enviroments are cool. They also provide a good range of weapons and vehicles, some creating very fun possibilities. (As a medic, you can kill enemies by zapping them with your shock paddles)It also provides a good challenge, without being impossible. I've only ever played single player, too, and I here it's much better online.My only complaint is that there isn't a campaign. I understand it isn't that kind of game, but it still would have made it funner."
2,NO Campaign mode,"This is a fun game for online, but there is no campiagn mode so if you want to play single player you just go on a map and free roam"
2,"Battlelfield 2,not bad.Try playing multiplayer","Battlefield 2 by itself is an ok game.The problem with this game is when you start to play the game online.Ughh,it horrible.Singleplayer,almost nill,is limited to 16 player maps,it gets boring quick.The multiplayer acspect of the game is good,when it works.The lag on the ranked servers,is unbearable,sometimes you cannot even get in the game due to the fact that the game takes so long to load,that by the time you do get in the round,its over.I really regret wasting my $50.00 on this game.I cannot recommend this game to even my worst enemy.It was and still is a big let down.If you do not head this warning and do get this game,make sure you have a great PC to run it on.I have a P4 3.6GHz 2Ghz mem and an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 256meg,and the game still studders."
4,Great Game,I had my problems at first. The game was running slow and I new it was because my computer. I didnt have the requirements. Now I am running it with a AMD 3400 3 Gigs of Ram and a x700 PCIE and it runs pretty smooth. It sometimes jumps but its ok.It is a fun game and it I recommend it if you like FPS.
3,machine gun isn't enought,"The others reviewrs almosts pointed everything, fantastic graphics, gameplay and nice maps. But I need to point one very nasting ""BUG"", you need to unload a full machine gun on the enemy to get him killed before he kills you with ONE and ONLY ONE BULLET ????? I was able to test this severall times on-line with multiplayer and it's really there, not a bad finger on my hand. If this game was builded to be the reference, nothing is loosed if we get REAL BULLETS on it."
2,not the original game as described,"Updated version 1.1 is not the 1.0 version, which I already own, I wanted a second copy for my friend, we found that he could not play on the same servers as a result of the version mismatch"
5,Best multiplayer war game ever,"If you like war games and challenges it's a must to have Battlefield 2.Maps are up to 64 players.You can drive a big variety of vehicle like cars,APC,tanks,transport helicopters,attack helicopters,jets and transport boats.The gameplay engine of this game is excellent.There is a system of rank and unlockable weapons for each of the 7 types of soldiers we can select.NEW STUFF:Electronic Arts is now giving the patch 1.50 for free which includes the addons Armor Fury and Euro force.Those contains new maps and a new army which are the European Coalitions.In fact I have this game since the first day it appeared in store in July 2004.I sent a copy of this game from Amazon.He got it in about one week and half.I would rate this game 15 on 10.More than excellent."
5,A bangin cd of jazz and hip hop,"This one gets better every time I listen to it. The majority of the beats are great, the majority of the rhymes are great.While most of the tracks on the album are great, the album is 20 tracks deep, and at least one could be removed. The one that would improve the album if removed is ""Living In This World."" It doesn't fit with the rest of the work. It's too up-tempo, it's too happy and cheesy. With out that one, there are still 15 phenominal songs on the album. Two of the best are ""The Traveler"" and ""Young Ladies"", which features Kool Keith.If you like the Roots ""Do You Want More???!!!"", you may like this one more."
2,I don like it..,"but I don't like super smooth jazz like that. but I respect the fact that alot of people could like this. It's good for what it is, boring guru-type rapping and super smoove jazz. if you like that, get this you shouldn't be disappointed"
4,The Best of Theresa Brewer,If you like the older songs this was a great CD it really brought back some good memories of when I was growing up and the songs my mom use to listen to.
2,Disappointed but it was written over 100 years ago,It was kind of shocking to see something this old being resold after the Military Stopped using it. You might be better off using something more current.
1,This book offers little for the beginner.,"This book was lacking in many areas. The definitions and explanations about franchising were often vague and incomplete. The topic of capital (about the most important part of franchising) was amazingly unclear. It was not ever mentioned exactly how much a person would need of their own funds vs. loans received from a bank. All 4 of the main Franchises I was interested in were not in the book, and the disclaimer in the beginning about why they weren't there justifies any omission. The book was just of no help to me whatsoever. I returned it."
5,Worth every penny,Tennis 2k2 is worth every penny of your money!!!! The graphics are unreal and the form on the players is very close to real life. The stadiums are out of this world. They look great!!!!!!!!! Even the training in the world tour is exiting. Seeing your player get better and better with each match keeps you playing and playing. I can't say enough about this game except that if you are going to get a tennis game this is by far the one to get and if you don't well you have made a huge mistake!
4,Punia and the King of Sharks,"I have been using this book all semester with 4-7 year-olds in creative art and drama classes. My students rated it as the book they most wanted me to bring back for an encore. It is delightful to see kids' gears turning as they comprehend each of Punia's tricks and predict the outcomes. They charged into the related class projects, and discussed the story on their own. It was a teacher's dream come true."
2,Chalky choco,"The product that I received was stale, with white powdery stuff on each individual candy bar. It was not glossy either like chocolate you buy at the local stores. The chocolately taste was also disappearing, appearing not normal. It was flakey but just not as chocolately as I remembered. I love this candy bar. However, even though this product was not expired, I will not buy it from the same seller again."
5,The Perfect Treat,Flake is absolutely my favorite chocolate. It is hard to eat because it falls apart but the taste is worth it and it just melts in your mouth. It is less sweet than American chocolate so if you like dead sweet chocolate don't buy this.
4,Flake Candy,"My Lady likes it alot, its chocolate.....What else you need to know about it? ! ! ! ! ! !"
5,An Expert Opnion,"It honestly is unfortunate Alvin Lee was'nt known for more than the preformance at Woodstock that labled him famous for ""I'm going home"". He was and still is a jazz and blues force that will more than likely never get the recognition he deserves for, not only his super fast guitar licks, but the clean precision in which he plays them. I recently attended a small club preformance by Mr. Lee and most of the younger audience could'nt grasp the more technical scales and leads he shoved at them until he plain rock & rolled them. After that some of the songs from the pre woodstock era, i.e ""I can't keep from cryin"" and ""help me"" sank in a bit deeper. Like many of the great preformers of his era Alvin Lee will more than likely NEVER get the credit he deserves."
1,True Blue,"True to the title this is Alvin's & (&TYA;'s) bluest...excellent,throughout. Tracks chosen from past works as well as newer compositions, I think were/are Great choices. My only beef is that more and more people are not aware of the magnificent musicianship of Ten Years After and,of course, Alvin Lee's genius. ...keep playin' on guys there are some of us who live for and appreciate your efforts...a true masterwork or as the French would say a chef-d'oeuvre... WOAH!!!Peace!!"
5,Cheapest anywhere.,These rings make hanging a shower curtian easy. They roll back and forth great. And they were cheaper than even Walmart.
4,They roll great and don't rust!,I have had them for a little over a month now and they still work great. No sign of rust and they roll great. I realized after the fact that the Crate&Barrel ones are the same price. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I'm not sure if they are they same or not but Crate&Barrel is usually quite a bit more expensive.
3,"Great guitarist, but...","He is an awesome guitarist, but I can't say the same about his songwriting skills. It's nothing really new or original. It's just a lotta balls-out shredding. Which is nice ar first, but then it gets pretty tedious after a while, and yes it does sond amatuerish, but he is an amateur. So what do you expect, and if you listen closely you can tell that he's stolen some riffs. He's plays well, but it's nothing I havn't heard before, and somtimes it's exactly what I've heard before!"
4,Great music.,"Ryan Formato is one of the greatest guitarist in along time. I originally heard him on Soundclick with his songs ""Arpeggio Autposy II"" and ""Eternal Promise"". Excellent pieces, I suggest everyone search for them. I can't wait to get the CD. I would give it 5 stars, but I havent heard the whole CD yet, but from what I have.. This kid is going to be the next guitar god if things keep going his way."
2,It sounded so promising...,"but did not live up to its potential. The acting was stiff and often contrived, or maybe it was just lack of directing. It was like one cliché strung up after another. I'm sorry to say we could not watch any more than the first 40 minutes to get to the 'build-up' of the story."
3,The Definitive Version?,"The limited edition import Who Are You is part of the 12 CD Who series from Polydor in Japan (POCP 9204). It includes a miniture cardboard copy of the original LP cover and the Nov 96 re-mastered CD. This release will be primarily of interest to hard-core collectors who want a complete set of the Japanese series.Only 3 stars for Keith Moon's last official album? That's because, outside of the title track, there is little that compels the listener to focus on the band and shut out the rest of the world. Perhaps it was the time: by Aug 78 rock bands were supposed to have figured out that the old ways were under seige. Who Are You was not a bad effort, but despite the story behind Pete's encounter with a couple of Sex Pistols and titles like Music Must Change, The Who's music no longer seemd to be in the vanguard of rock. Yet younger fans have often written to say this is one of their favorite Who albums. Rock on, dudes!"
1,Got a bad one. Cardone is great though,"Can't always go right with refurb units, I got 2 back ones 1 from Amazon/Cardone and 1 from Napa. Third times a charm I guess. I was happy Napa carried them and I could just return the item for exchange nd not do the whole mailing back and forth, cost more.I have purchased refurb car parts from Cardone previously with success, Refurb is a gamble. Cardone has replaced a defective item for me in the past without hassle."
2,Not nearly as good as the old genesis versions,"This is one of my favorite puzzle games and I wanted a copy of it for my GBA. Unfortunately, this version isn't as good as the genesis versions are.The gems are now different shapes, which is good for color blind people.The game speeds to unplayable levels incredibly quickly if you do not get combos of 3 or more.There is also no ""instant drop"" button so you can't get the rhythm going that one does in tetris of playing as fast as they can."
4,Fun Game,"This game brings me back to the Sega Genesis days. It may be a Tetris [take off], but it's a different concept. Unless you're into classic Sega gaming, this will be a fun you. I recommend this for the the classic gamers."
2,Columns climbs to the top . . . and crashes??!!,"Being a huge Columns fan, I thought this game was going to kick arse!! Unfortunately, this game, even with all its new features, is only worthy of two stars. Then again, maybe it's just the dark GBA screen!!!"
2,short sleeve,"The sleeves were too short. The didn't even get up to his wrist. My husband is 5.9"" and he usually wears sleeve length 34/35. I thought i was sent a wrong size but we checked the size info at the neck, we saw 34/35 was written there as sleeve length. All his long sleeve dress shirts are 34/35 but this 34/35 was short."
2,Horrible Customer Service,"I have never had such horrible customer service in my life. I ordered this through Amazon and they sent it to an outside supplier. The outside supplier screwed up and offered a complete different item and then realized after sending the complete different item that they actually had it in stock. I asked them to cancel my order, which they didn't and as of last Thursday the 17th of February I got it anyway....a month after ordering it.For my wedding.Never again.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H2PMB8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Not quite what I expected.,"It wasn't quite what I expected because it is kinda a pain maintaining it, it didn't stay cool as long as I had hoped, and it was kinda uncomfortable to sleep on. It would help me fall asleep, but was useless by the middle of the night. I have migraines, so it works wonders when I have a migraine, but not on hot nights."
5,These grips work great,This grip adds a thicker feel to the gun and makes it easier to hold tight. They fit the gun pefectly!Thanks Pearce for making such a quality product.
3,highlights of one-sided fights,"With the exception of the four round Moore fight, these are all snippets and highlights of longer bouts. Archie Moore at 48, one of the most brilliant and cunning light-heavies of all time decided to square off with a prime Cassius Clay and the results are sad. It was Archie's last fight. I would have liked to have seen more of the Ali/Floyd Patterson bout. Floyd was a small heavy who was over-matched, but he still had fast hands and skills. Real fight fans would always like to see old fights in their entirety. Perhaps the producers of this DVD think attention spans are short and that's why they cut the fights to pieces?"
4,"Great Historical value Ali,Moore,and Patterson",I was really shocked that i found this dvd. i got it in a Three pack with Ali Rap and Espn 2009 highlights. Didn't even know this dvd existed. I really Enjoyed watching all the fights on this Dvd. Archie Moore was incredible to do as good as he did agaisnt Ali at the age of 48 or 51. Archie's Mother said he is three years older than his stated age and she should have known best. I also love having a Floyd Patterson fight. This man was a class act and i always loved his peekaboo style of fighting. I had never seen the Brian London or Karl Mildenburger fights. This is a great find for any hardcore boxing fan. The Patterson fight is not complete but part of the fight is better than none.
1,Black Bass Fishing is a Boring Game,The game is boring and we would never suggest anyone buying it. It was a waste of money. The bad thing is that it was for a gift.
1,Don't waste your money,"The title of my review says it all. Don't waste your money. I bought this game and after trying it for a dozen or so times, ended up putting it in my case and forgetting about it. Very disappointed in it."
1,Not Happy,"The Cable does not work at all, I was told I was buying new and it came without the package and overall all i'm quite displeased about the whole endeaver."
1,Not a Nintendo product- Does not work.,"Despite the image shown, I was shipped a cable from a company called Myiicco and it did not work. I contacted the company and they quickly and politely shipped another one but again, it did not work. The reason I purchased this cable was because I thought it was a Nintendo product and therefore, would definitely work with another Nintendo product."
1,Don't Do It,If you want to catch them all don't buy it. If you want all of the 150 pokemon this is not your buy.
1,Rip-Off,"I can sum it up in one sentence:It doesn't work.It doesn't work with ""Game Boy Color"", it doesn't work with ""Game Boy Advance"", and it doesn't work with ""Game Boy Advance SP"". My brother and I were trying to trade ""Pok'emon"" and whichever Game Boy had the purple side in it, their game said ""Your friend isn't ready to trade yet"" or something like that. I tried pressing the buttons at the same time on the Game Boys, I tried having my brother hold the pieces in really tight, nothing worked. This link cable is a rip-off, and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Not What It Seems,You will probably recieve a 3rd party cable if you are looking at the picture and thinking that you're getting the nintendo-made cable. Mine wasn't even the right one when I recieved it.
5,Dream Club,"I was at work one day, and this guy drives up to the window. I ask him what he is listening to, and he says its Dream Club Version 4. He says to me that this CD is hard to come by. He was right. When I first ordered this CD, it took me a month to recived it. But it is well worth it. It is a CD with upcoming artists and DJ's, and it has some spectacular songs. It definitly is good to get you prepared to go to a club. It starts of with Science Fiction, and once you hear the song, you'll know you are in for a real treat! I highly recomend this CD, and if you are not sure about it, try listining to some of the songs first."
3,Luvit,"I had not paid attention to this artistin the past.But, after listening to some of the tracks,lemme tell you, I LUVIT!I keep one of his cds nearbly all da time.Yeah, I've bought many of his cds ..."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!,"Everybody's curls are different. Mine love this product! I got it as a sample and fell in love with it instantly! I've never tried the ""Curls Rock"" line so I can't compare. I have below-shoulder length hair that is really curly and for me this stuff works great!"
1,Uninspired,"Curlesque is the improved version of Curls Rock. They have removed the sulfates & changed the formula in other ways. It does NOT lather. I use 3-4 pumps of the 24 oz size & well, maybe it cleans my hair, but I don't like it.The oldCatwalk Curls Rock Shampoo By Tigi For Unisex Shampoo, 12 Ouncetook very little shampoo to work up a great lather & it never bothered my scalp. My hair stylist was very impressed by the health of my hair after waiting a year between cuts. No split ends even.fyi: my hair is thick, graying (not dyed), ringlet type curls that is a mix of coarse to fine; so finding good hair products can be difficult. I useLakme K.Style Rings Style Control Curl Activator Balm 5.1 ozto tame the frizz without adding weight"
1,Alcohol Based!,"Wow, way to budget cut a product Tigi! I have looong curly hair and I've been using your product for 10 years. My hair went to moist and soft with the original ""Curls Rock"" to straw with your so called ""Curl Collection""! Read the label and not the packaging, alcohol is what drys out your hair and they are the top ingredients in their new expensive product. Keep your cucumbers and give me back my Curls Rock.And the bottle! The conditioner doesn't even have a pump I have to squeeze the bottle to get out a huge gob of thick perfumey, non-moisturizing, expensive.... glob! I put water in it today to try and get it out of the bottle! It's almost a full bottle! Seriously!"
1,Junk,I used this device 1 day and found out it would not re-charge. Then I called customer support and the first person I spoke to put me on hold then it hung up. I called back and the automated service picked up... What happened next?The service line kept looping back to the main intro leaving me with no option but to get mad and write this review. The device itself was ok until the battery died. The customer service people should be fired and the on line support is a joke.... Spend the extra cash and buy something else....
1,A Nightmare!,"Yes, please, do not buy this MP3 Player!!First off, I could not put more then 135 songs on it, even though I still had over 1 GB space left on it. Then, for whatever reason, I suddenly could put more songs on it, so, I was exited. Recently I updated my songs on it and since then I cannot turn the player on again. Even when I hook it up to the PC or the charger, it does not turn back on! I researched the net to find out how to restart this player, no such luck! Trouble over trouble..."
2,Battery life a lie...,"On the packaging of this MP3 player it states that it has a 6 - 8 hour MAX battery life. I listened to this (or tried to) at work and it only lasted for 2.5 hours. This was the first time I had used it and I had fully charged it. Also realize that you cannot have this plugged into a power source while you listen to it. It only has one plug that is used for connection to the computer, headphones and power.It was also difficult to setup on the computer, the so-called software that comes with it is useless, does nothing whatsoever to allow you to put music on this player.My boss wanted this because it was so cute, I had to tell her to look for something else, there was no way I would recommend this item to anyone.At this point I have not been able to find any troubleshooting sites with help on how to extend the battery life."
4,No Problemo!,I was very shocked to read the reviews listed here. I have not had any problems with this player yet and I have owned it for about 5 months. I already have a video iPod so I bought this soley for working out. I didnt have to put in software on my computer works great with Windows Media Player and it syncs up pretty fast.
3,China made,Bought 4 of these units from Sam's club clearance shelf for $19 apiece. Made very cheap. 2 units have failed to work and I cannot find support. The phone number has been disconnected. Cannot format 1 unit.
1,Asian Knockoff of an Asian Product,"I can't add too much more to what has been said about this particular mp3 player except that the device that this item (Digi-Cube) is a cheap (chinese) copy of the Mobiblu (Korean) Cube mp3 player, which is more expensive but actually works reliably. I would recommend looking for the Mobiblu product instead of settling for the Digi-Cube. I inadvertently ordered 2 of the items and found that one unit won't turn on at all and the other won't let me remove music files once I've placed them in the memory. Anyway, I see that some people have _not_ had trouble with this device and I have to say that it will be the luck of the draw. I will also agree that the disc you receive with it has no real purpose. The AC recharging unit is the most useful thing in the package as I can use it to recharge my Mobiblu Cube."
4,this stuff works well!!!,"i am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair and this has been a wonderful product for my hair, i wash my hair then i apply a very small amount of this pomade to my hair as my hair dry it shines, and give a wavy effect and my hair stays that way until i style it again, its very light, very good smelling, not greasy at all and a small amount gies a long ways,i just love this stuff!! i make sure i keep some at all times on hand, my co-workers think i have a texturizer in my hair but its not its the ic fantasia ice pomade and not only do my hair looks good it smells good i dont use any oils like i use to this is all i use now!! its simply great!!! i wont ever use anything esle on my hair!!."
3,Doesn't last,"When i apply this on my hair, it looks and feels good for like 20 minutes, then my hair goes back to being dry. It does a good job smoothening my hair (for a while). I guess it doesn't work the way i want it to, because i have very thick african hair. Otherwise, I would buy it again."
3,Shades of Nick and Nora Charles!,"Overlapping dialogue and lots of cocktails ! Emma Marsh and her boyfriend Hank Fairbanks are drawn into another murder connected to her boss and his antique business.The rural cops are only two of the loony eccentric characters in this entertaining mystery. Although not as tightly woven as a preceding title, it is still a fun read. The dialogue is so well done that I'm surprised Hollywood didn't snap up the author as a screenwriter. This book would be a great candidate for a movie. I could just see Jimmy Stewart..no...anyway, don't pass this up!"
2,NBA 2K2,"I was reading some of the reviews for this game and I was shocked at the results. This game does not even compare to NBA Live 02. The gameplay is very poor, as well as the player detail. In live, the players actually look like the players. I do not recommend this over NBA Live 02."
1,"Please, this game is the worst I have ever played.",The players are so unrealistic they remind me of nintendo graphics. The controls are so complecated to that of NBA live 2002. The crossover was expecially hard to control. NBA shootout 2002 is better than this. I advise you to stick with NBA live. This is the ghetto NBA Live.
5,Slam Dunk,This is the hoop game I've been waiting for since early Live 98 and 99. This game has it all. If you just like basketball this game will make you love it. From the graphics to gameplay I cannot put this game down. The low post moves the attacks to the basket the defensive rotations and last but not least the thunderous dunks gives this game hours of enjoyment. Not only can you stay in the areans but you can take it to the park with no refs and play hard. They added more courts like the rec center so you can get the park feeling inside on wood. This is a must have of any PS2 holder. Next Madden the best sports game ever made.
4,NBA2k2 shoots and score,"Sega hit it big this year with it's recent release of NBA2k2. It give amazing graphics and killer game playing. the new A.I is amazing the computer plays just like a real game. The new stealing system for teh game made a diffrence too, is you give off a bad pass teh D is smart and will steal it from the air. The things that Sega still needs to work on for next year will make the game even better. The character creating is to hard, I had a 100 rated player but he had no defence, to solve this they should give you more stat point or give you unlimeted stat points. Another thing is on franchise you can have your created play during it you can only use him for a regular season. And I though the controls were kinda weird too. All in all it is an amazing game a must buy on any ones list even for the non-basketball fans. Even thought they need to work on somthing for next year we have to remeber there is no such thing as the perfect game."
5,MUST GET,"NBA2K2 I HAD PLAYED FOR DREAMCAST IT IS AWESOM I CANT BELIEVE THE GRAPHICS AND THE CONTROL OF THE PLAYERS IT IS SO SMOOTH AND SO REALISTIC, ALSO EMOTIONAL. IN PROBARLY A FEW YEARS EA SPORTS WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS, I WISH THIS GAME FOR PS2 WOULD COME THE SAME DAY AS NBA2K2 FOR DREAMCAST BUT I'VE BEEN PATIENT AND ITS COMING."
2,One of the worst basketball games ive played,"I may be alone in my thinking but this game is worse than NBA 2k for Dreamcast.To start off with the free throw shooting system is very hard to use,ive tried endlessly to line up the two arrows with the basket,having never succeeded.There are other reasons why I don't like this game,but i won't go into all of them.to be fair this game has gorgeous graphics and the player likenesses are the best i have seen."
1,Dont believe the hype !!,"My brother came home from school and rented this game. I was expecting something real good from all of the reviews I have seen. But I was very disappointed. The graphics look just like a dreamcast game, not up the PS2 expectations. The gameplay is really horrible, you can't even make a shot! If you have a Nintendo Gamecube like myself, go out and buy NBA Courtside 2002. it is much better than this game in every way. the only thing that i like in this game is the different street courts. this game is definately only a rent, not even a rent. dont waste your time and money."
5,Great Game...One major flaw,"This is by far the best b-ball game out there. You can't find another game that is more realistic than this one. In the previous versions it seemed way too easy to score and just beat up the AI, but that's been taken care of. You have to actually work to score. The thing that almost renders this game unplayable however is the AI. It's too good and it makes it completely unbelievable. The opposing team never shoots under 50% for the game. You'd swear the hawks were the lakers. Travis Knight becomes a shooting God. If your playing with Jordan, he sucks, but if the AI has him he never misses. I actually saw Charlie Ward out-rebound Shaq and Bryant under the basket. I think Sega did a good job making the defense more intelligent but it seems rather pathetic when the opposing team gets every rebound and makes every shot no matter what team it is or who they're matched up against. If this were more balanced out this game would be absolutely perfect."
2,Not Realistic,"While NBA 2K2 is the best of a marginal lot of Basketball simulators for the PS2, it should not be called a Basketball simulation. The game play is solid and the graphics are good, but the Computer constantly shoots >60%, and players such as Cuttino Mobley, Christian Laettner, and Keon Clark should not be dominating the game. If looking for a basketball video game, I recommend either waiting for NBA 2K3 (hopefully all the glitches will be worked out) or get NBA Street."
3,Dissapointed,"2K2 on PS2 is far worse than on Dreamcast. I think they used up too many resources on the practice and street modes and the actual season game play suffered. Graphics are not as crisp as on Dreamcast, stats are HORRIBLE, and the small details which made this game great on Dreamcast are lacking (i.e. much more crowd and coach movement). It might sound picky but this game went from hands down the best b-ball game ever to NBA Live competition, which doesn't say much."
5,BEST B-BALL GAME SINCE DOUBLE DRIBBLE,"2K2 is straight up the best basketball game ever. I thought this game was great when i played it on DreamCast and now that its on PS2, it blows every other game out of the water. I love playin with my favs from the old school and new school out on the playground or rec centers and watchin em do the illest moves and jams. This game is non-stop fun. BUY IT NOW"
3,NBA 2K2,"The game is pretty fun, the graphics are good, but my one complaint (and this goes for every other basketball game for the PS2)is the fact that there is no Slam Dunk Contest. WHY THE HELL NOT??? I remember playing games for my Sega Genesis that had a slam dunk contest. What gives?"
1,A different version of the item was shipped,"I received a version of the item that was not published by Westview, that had a soft cover, that was missing the front matter, and that was not in as good condition as advertised. I think the version I received was published by the U.S. Army War College, but with the missing front matter, I cannot be sure. As I'm using this publication for a research project, the missing information is important.If you purchase this item, it may be best to double check with the seller so that you don't end up with the wrong item. While Amazon.com's customer service team addressed my concerns, I'm back to square one in my search for the described item."
3,Doesn't stand the test of time,"This was an average game when it came out, nothing groundbreaking. Graphically, even at the time, it was substandard, but it really suffers by comparison now. Gameplay was really the only redeeming thing about the game but there is so much better now. Recommended only for the die-hard fans of the genre."
2,it was ok...,"I'm a big fan of civilization 3 and this was like a slower, easier, and less fun version of that. It seemed like a lot of people liked it but it's basically hit or miss i guess with this game... basically it missed. Kept me entertained for a little while though and for the price probably worth it."
3,galactic civilizatins,"game lacks originality, feels just like the older versions of galactic games. but still fun to play"
3,*shrug*,"This isn't a bad album, it's just that there are so many other bands out there doing the same thing, often better-- The Gathering, Madder Mortem, Sinergy, Lullacry, The Gallery, to name just a few. There is a track or two that does stick in the mind (Kingdom's Legacy, for example), but on the whole it is rather undistinguished."
1,Save your money,"This movie is a sham, a two-bit video shoot that must have cost about [$] to make. I hope I can pursuade at least one person not to buy this movie."
4,The Scot who gave medicine everything,"I'll be brief because what can one really say? ""The Reluctant Surgeon"" is nearly as good a biography as one can get. It tells of Dr. John Hunter, the 18th century Scots doctor who basically invented everything good about medicine and treatment - and who was far ahead of his time as a surgeon. A bit mad, a bit loud and very coarse with people he perceived as ignorant, Dr. Hunter gave the world so much that I can only recommend this nearly flawless biography - find out for yourself what this man did to rocket medicine 150 years into its future.One complaint: This thing delves far too deeply into the life of Dr. Hunter's almost-equally famous physician brother William. While I'm not saying leave William out, I also rather resent the chapter devoted only to him. In them, barely a peep about the biography's subject. That, in my book, is nearly unforgivable and for that I deduct one star.I grew up reading and re-reading this bio. Ignore my sideline-whine and READ IT!!"
4,I'm the first reviewer? No!,This game is truly a classic! But I can't be the first reviewer. That is just ridiculous! Must be a mistake by Amazon.I will give this game high marks. Really hits the nail on the head!Great game!MC White said: Check it out!!!!
