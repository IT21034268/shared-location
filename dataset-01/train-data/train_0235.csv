5,Great toy!,My kids received many things for Christmas but this is the best gift they received! They play with it several times a day. It's a great toy for rainy days as well. The only negative is that is it loud! But otherwise it is highly recommended.
3,okay,"while this toy is cheaply made and can break easily, it still kept my 4 year old entertained as she chased it around the kitchen floor in a circle, and hopped over it. is it too baby-ish for a 4 year old? probably. i would say a good age for this is 2-3 yrs."
2,the fun didn't last long,"I bought this for my sons 3rd bday.he was so excited, it was a fun new game. BUT then it broke after only a day of play. something happened to the motor, it now sounds like the gears are not turning correctly? it is not made to last~ bummer, the concept is great and while it worked he had fun!"
4,Exercise is fun!,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 1/2 year old son. He has enjoyed chasing the bee (rather than jumping over it) with his 5 year old brother! Although, neither boy has gone and got it out to play with on their own, they both really get excited when I pull it out. I am a bit nervous when they accidentally jump on the stick because it does seem like it will break easily but for the price....it's worth it to get your kids up and moving."
4,Hoppin' fun for your toddler!,"This is such a simple, but great toy for toddlers. My 2 and 1/2 year old daughter just loves jumping and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect toy. It's perfect for those cold winter days we can't get outside and she needs to expend some energy - just let them jump away! I love that it has a slow and fast setting, the slow is perfect for kids still learning to jump. The toy is a bit flimsy, but it hasn't been a problem for us, lots of toddler friends carrying it around and it hasn't broken yet! Definitely recommended."
5,A MILLION LAUGHS!!!,"This toy was the hit of the party for my 2 year old grandson. Even though he is too young to hop over it successfully, we all had a blast watching him try. He was tickled pink and even though he stepped on it several times, it just keeps going. Everyone got such a kick out of it. We all laughed and laughed - it was so much fun. I highly recommend this hopover bee toy.Nancy MylesSan Leandro, CA"
1,"""the finest ingredients"" ?!","Since when do ""the finest ingredients"" include corn syrup and gelatin? My kids brought some of this stuff home from Valtentines day at school... Mars wisely decided not to put the ingredients on the packaging, so here I am online to find out what's in it... and I have to say I was very angry when I read the description & ingredients here. This shouldn't be given to children; the only creatures suited to eat this garbage are bottom-feeders and certain types of bacteria. Straight to the garbage with this."
3,Another Fundamental English Lao Tzu,"Blakney's Tao Te Ching is, like that of Paul Carus, interesting as a historical document in the development of an English literature and perspective on Lao Tzu's enduring masterpiece, the Tao Te Ching. Again like Carus, however, Blakney's language is often dated, and the paraphrasing that appears at the bottom of each poem, as if in translation of the translation, is distracting at best. For enthusiasts of Lao Tzu who like to study the development of our understanding of this marvelous view of life in the history of its articulation into English, having a copy of the Blakney is essential. But for those who wish to simply enjoy Lao Tzu's voice in a modern English rendering, the work of Ursula LeGuin, Stephen Mithcell, or Feng/English would be sufficient. ..."
2,"A fun toy, but very flimsy","This is a fun toy for the little ones, but I am disappointed in how flimsy it is. The basket is plastic and just snaps together. It has already come apart several times and I have to snap it back in place. My son loves to wheel it around, but if I had to do it over again, I would buy a more expensive one that is higher quality and will last longer."
2,"Not safe for toddlers, but is toddler sized for Ages 5 & up?","This toy is designed for a toddler due to its small size, but interestly is advertized for ages 5 & up. I now know why. It's a hazard. Pros: toddlers love pushing it & it's realistic looking. Incidents with this toy include: tot's head got stuck between handle bar and main cart, tot's foot got stuck in bottom tray slats, wheels continually got stuck on deck furniture with the gap they have in middle, causing toddler distress. Also, the cart is light weight enough that my boy is compelled to race it along the walls and on top of tables. Finally couldn't take it anymore and threw this toy out today. Get the Little Tikes plastic cart instead (our kids love those at nearby rec center), which I'm going to buy to replace this one. I used to be anti-plastic, but with tots, no more. Steel and wood products and tots don't mix well. Plastic is far more safe, as companies such as Step2, Mattel and Fisher Price know all so well."
5,five stars!!!,"i recieved it quickly, it was two discs in a box ""the definitive Kay Starr on Capitol, Thanks. very good oldies music, Herzel"
4,Ever felt uneasy when relating with people? This book helps!,"There are hundreds of books that talk about self development but this book differes, because, it is based on scientific principles of Transactional Anlysis. A good book for those who want self development and believe in rational & scientific approach than in emotional & impulsive approach."
2,Written for the proffesional. Reads much like a text book.,Written more for the professional than those seeking self understanding. It reads much like a text book and lacks personality.
4,A very good book.,"I read this book, and I would have to say that it is one of the best tools in understanding how and why people act the way that they do. I work with the public every day, and was at my wit's end with my customers and the way that they act. After reading this book I have a deeper understanding of their and my inner workings and have found my work life to be more productive and less confrontational. Great book."
1,Hocus Pocus,"I reread this book after a gap of 10 years. In this time I had done a bit of reading up on philosophy and psychotherapy. Looking at this book again I find that, contrary to claims by Dr Harris, his methods are not scientifically validated and the whole notion of group psychotherapy has been trivialized. Another hidden agenda of the book that Dr Harris slant makes refernce to is the glorification of ""Christian Psychology"". In all this book serves the perfect example of amateurish attempts at pop psychology that has done more harm than anticipated."
4,transactional analysis revealed,"I really enjoyed the illustrations of relationships this book had to offer. Basically, there are different combinations - usually between 2 people but can be more - in which certain mindsets or stages of ego-consciousness (Parent, Child, and Adult or Superego, Id and Ego) engaged in dialogue will result in certain reactions and responses. There are consistent patterns in this, a sort of script if you will. In analyzing one's own scripts, one can break free from them and find a third way, that is, of the Adult, and attract other Adults; or at least, be able to effectively resolve issues that could easily be avoided. This is an attempt to mature one's methods of communication. I wish there were more groups about Transactional Analysis.Also check out ""Games People Play."""
3,Good book,"Is a good read, but it has become boring at some point, also it's a product of its time, some of the comments made look dated at this point"
2,"I'm OK, you're a sociopathic serial killing psychiatrist...","Total let-down. Hannibal Lecter doesn't even appear once. I really expected more from the interim novel between ""Black Sunday"" and ""Red Dragon."" There's none of the thrill or suspense that made Harris famous, instead it reads like a '70s pop psychology manual. Skip this one, read his later novels instead."
3,loops review fyi,"I love the idea of the cotton - VG, however, I am getting a reaction 'I believe' to the dye in the cotton. Every time I pick it up, my sinuses well up inside (throb) and I sneeze. There is something in the dye of this item. I still work with it because I love the loom and the colors, etc. It is to let you know as I have the opportunity to write it to you here. I have made sixteen of these potholders already. I am accumulating them for gifts next year.I am also thinking when I get the next lot of these loops, what I may do is launder them in a mesh bag first and drip dry them. This might get rid of any residual dye from the processing, etc.Thanks for a great product. I truly do love it."
3,"Vibrant color, durable material and easy to use.",Purchased for my seven-year-old grand daughter who is looking forward to making several Christmas presents with the loops. She loves the bright colors. Hope I receive one of the pot holders.
3,Adequate loops with some strings hanging,"These loops are adequate but I cannot give them very high of a rating. They had lots of loose ends which would frequently snag causing some harsh words to be said over them. They seem somewhat expensive (to me) at about $2.50 per potholder (36 loops) for only average quality. The color selection was somewhat limited in the assorted bags. Additional colors are available in one-color-per-bag lots. Also the size and thickness varied from loop to loop. Overall, less quality than what I would like to work with."
5,Terrific activity for kids aged 6 to 8,"Our grandchildren -- boys and girls aged six to eight -- thoroughly enjoyed making the potholders and then using them in the kitchen. We recall their parents having the same reaction 25 years ago. This is a wonderful, constructive activity fit for small fingers."
5,"Small, Digitized, and Accurate Scale for Small Items and Herbs",The nice top protecting the weighing surface is an outstanding feature. You have precision measurement with the convenience of a pocket device with the ability to get a tare weight and use any small container. Have had this item for over a year.
3,Shedding Tool for Cats,"This tool works great for brushing my 6 cats and removing more fur and dander than some of my other grooming brushes; however, my problem with this shedding tool (and the reason for a 3 rating) is that it's open design in the middle causes the fur it has removed to fly all over the place. Some of the fur does get caught up in the ""shedding blade"" (the teeth of the brush), but more seems to fly around than gets caught. You have to brush very slowly and be very careful to try and catch the fur that it is pulling off. If they could somehow perfect this type of brush where it would catch the fur as it is removing it (maybe by somehow removing the hole in the middle), this might work better and receive a 5 rating."
2,Waste of time,"From the title, I thought this was a review of well researched, documented alternate therapies for ADHD, as my son could not tolerate his ritalin therapy. Instead the author would have you believe that almost no child had ADHD and that soaking in an herbal bath is just the ticket. Perpetuates the myth that ADHD is just overdiagnosed and that children are being overly mediacted because of a conspiracy by drug companies, CHADD, and/or physicians. Expected a little more form a health care professional but should have questioned how relevent when saw it was written by an optometrist. Found the book to be a way of grandstanding the new field of behavioral optometry without giving any practical advice."
3,Cheaply made,"My son really loves Spongebob and it's hard to find toys that are Spongebob these days so I bought this. It's a little cheaply made but nevertheless cute. comes with a credit card, some paper and plastic money and a working microphone. I think my son is a little old for this gift, he is 5 and didn't play with it for more than 3 minutes."
4,Received as ordered,"The shoe covers were exactly as ordered. It took a little longer than I anticipated to receive them, but there were no problems at all with the order."
5,Another classic undaground album!,"TRU's 2nd album is off the hook! It's not as hard as Understanding The Criminal Mind but it was pretty close! The best songs are Who's Da Killer?, Neighborhood Dopeman, Talk About It, and Sweated By The Po Po's! If y'all see this anywhere(like in a local record store or something) buy it cuz this album is TIGHT!"
3,mixed review,"I have a real mixed review to report on the DVD. The sound is good and the video is good but they are not in synch which I find annoying. There is no menu for song titles or extras. Also, the DVD will play on one of my players but not the other. This is a shame for us Robert Gordon fans who have been hungry for a good concert video from our main man. This product should have been better than it is presented."
1,Never received the Region 1 DVD,Ordered this item only to receive a DVD not playable on American machines. Informed Amazon of the problem and received the same thing again. Beware. O stars.
2,"Its a PAL disc, I believe","This disc is most likely a PAL disc that will not play in many USA DVD players. The disc would not play in either of my two DVD players.I was forced to return it (kudos to Amazon for accepting the return without a fuss), so I haven't been able to view it."
5,Trofimov's Haj,"This remarkable book is Trofimov's journalistic Haj to almost every Muslim country from Bosnia to Saudi Arabia where he manages to interview every prominent Islamist, evading bullets, as history unfolds around him. Secondly, and perhaps more disturbingly, this is Trofimov's quest to understand the Islamist psyche and his analysis of why Islamists hate the West. The most surprising part of this book was that the rational part of the collective Islamist psyche, the part that the West assumes is simply masked by ""extremists"", is to be found in Mali! I had to check my atlas. Certainly this book will change your perspective of the post 9/11 world with a harsh dose of reality served with ceremonial roast lamb, rice and the smile factor."
3,Love it and Hate it,"I both love and hate this joystick. The feel is great and when it works it works great. The problem is that this is my third joystick in the past two years (of the exact same make and model). I fly a lot on flight sims and, after about 9-10 months use, parts start to break. Worse, it is getting harder and harder to find this joystick (with force feedback and rudder control on the throttle). I did buy another one because I am so used to this stick. If I could find a great deal on three or four of them, I would buy them. If you have never used a stick before, you might be best to steer clear of this one because it is very difficult to re-train yourself to a new stick if you need to (when this one breaks). It's a bummer, because, though I have lots of problems with the hardware, I am addicted!"
4,My lovely Joystick,"It is a good looking joystick that impressing me. After using ,it is working ok . I like it ."
5,five stars,This is a great family game for older kids. Card players enjoy the fast pace. it would be great Christmas gift.
4,My personal Opinion is it is just FUN,"We had only played ""Five Crowns"" once before, but wanted to play it some more, so ordered from Amazon Verified Purchase, got it quickly and have enjoyed playing it again and again. Taught more friends the game as well. One can play the game and visit at the same time."
2,Innocuous game of rummy that's mostly luck,"There are certainly worse games, but there are much better as well. Playing Five Crowns with 2 players didn't seem markedly different than simply playing Gin (actually, it was a little less fun because in Gin there are points on the line for going out first/knocking/undercutting). With 6 players the game took a long time, and there doesn't seem to be much skill in deciding whether or not to pick up the discard, nor in choosing which cards to keep.I imagine kids might like making sets and runs, but for adults there are many other games that are much more entertaining."
4,Great for all ages!,"This is a wonderful card game that is quick, different each time, great for 2-7 players. Each time we play this someone who hasn't played, we give them our set and buy another one!! Wish the quality of the cards was a bit better as they wear ut too quickly. Price on Amazon.com beat our local store by $3.00!"
4,Five Crowns,We had played this card game before with someone else and thought it was fun. It is better with four people than just two.
5,Game for all ages,"Five Crowns is a wonderful card game that is enjoyed by all ages. It's fun for 2 people or a group. It's simple but not so simple that it's mindless. Kids and adults can enjoy playing it together. Great product! I enjoy playing Rook, Spades, Dominoes & Rummy. If you enjoy those games, you might want to try Five Crowns. And remember, the game's not over til the Kings go wild!!!"
5,Huge hit with family and friends!,"My friends and family love to play games, and we are always on the hunt for something new. I came across this game here on amazon, and it had great reviews and sounded fun so I took a shot and bought it for my mother. Everyone we have played the game with loves it. It is easy to learn and play, and can go by quickly. There have been times when we have sat and played over and over again for hours. Most everyone we have played with has bought one for themselves and their family members. After receiving the game herself, my mother has bought 3 more for 2 friends, and an extra one for us to have around the house. I highly recommend this game to those who just love fun card games."
5,Portable family fun,"I love this game -- it is great to toss it in my pocketbook or tote bag and take with us on a trip. It doesn't take up much space, and can entertain us for quite a long period of time. We have played this with my step-son since he was 6 -- for the later rounds it is a little challenging for him to hold all the cards and keep track of what he has, but we just give him plenty of time for his turn and he is able to hold his own against the adults. The rules are simple enough that you can teach the game in just a few minutes -- also because the rounds gradually increase in card number and complexity of options, you get to start out very basic which also helps any noobs.We love the sub-title that the game is not over until the 'Kings go wild' ... it is really true! Even if you are 100 points behind, in the last round if you get lucky and your opponent do not, you could still win. I have bought this for gifts and it is always enjoyed."
5,Great Family Fun,I highly recommend this card game. It's easy to learn and it's portable too. We take it on vacation and it keeps my family together in the evening instead of people drifting off to computers or TV.
5,you must buy Five Crowns card game its so much fun,This is one of the funniest card games I have played in a long time. We play every night three to four times its so much fun. I bought two more game and sent to my sister and my Aunt and they love it as well. I recommend anyone that likes card games to purchase this game.
5,Takes rummy to the next level.,"This is a really great family card game! We love to play card games, and our children even learned to recognize their numbers by playing when they were young. Five Crowns is similar to rummy, but takes it to the next level. We spent hours last winter playing it and our 6 year old was able to join in after observing one game. Each hand, the wild card changes, and there are five suits, (the usual 4 plus stars) so you really have to pay attention. The cards themselves are bright and beautiful. I would recommend this game especially to rummy fans who have mastered the usual version. It is also possible to play crazy eights, go fish, etc. with this deck for an interesting twist."
2,No Skill Involved,"I give this game 2 out of 5 stars. While it could be fun under certain circumstances, there is no skill involved, whatsoever. If you are OK with playing a game for an hour to see who is the luckiest among you, this is the game for you. If instead you are looking for an easy game that still provides some strategic choices... look elsewhere."
5,Shows How Fun Cards Can Be,"A friend visiting from out-of-town introduced me to this game and gave it to me as a gift. It is very easy to learn as it is similar to traditional card games, but adds a new dimension or two. We already owned the game SET, created by the same company, and I highly recommend that one too (though you have to use your noggin a bit more). The great thing about Five Crowns is as other family members watched us play, they wanted a piece of the action as well. Even my five-year-old can play it to an extent.The game takes about 30-40 minutes to play a full game, but you can really stop anytime you want. And unlike some card games, this game is just as fun with two people as it is with six. Highly recommended."
5,Fun and Easy Card Game,This is an easy to learn and fun game to play with all ages. It is similar to rummy but easier.
4,This is it,Just what I was looking for. We play card all the time and this is based on one of the games we play
5,Rating 5 Crowns,This game is interesting and fun to play. The more people around the table. Lots of fun and laughter when we play 5 crowns.
5,5crowns card game,I love the card game. I bought 12 card games of this for Christmas gifts and everyone loved it. It is a game that 2 or up to 7 cam play at a time. My niece in 2nd grade and my mother at age 85 played in the same game. I have requests to get more cards for more people that have played the game!
5,Great family game,"This is a great game for the family, although you can play with two.My eight year old nephew beats me all the time."
5,Best Card Game Ever,"My whole family LOVES this game. At summertime, we play this almost every night. From kids up to grandparents, we all enjoy it. It has become our favorite past time."
5,Great Card game!,"great card game. easy instructions and easy to play. we have added a few house rules to keep the scores closer. and also modified the rounds to shorten the game as well. a full game with your average card players takes 45 min.house rule #1. you cannot 'go out' on the first round. this gives everyone atleast two chances to pick cards.house rules #2. the doubles rule. this goes into effect when scoring after each round. if a player has two of the same card, they only count as one when tallying up the score. for example, if the round you are playing is 5(the number of cards in your hand), and a player has 7H 7S 7S 10D 10H after their last turn, the player only gets 10 points rather than 20 according to the original rules.to shorten the game try playing only odd card rounds, 3, 5, 7, etc.game is well worth it. we buy a new deck every year becuase we outplay the old cards. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME."
4,composition of product,The Five Crowns cards purchased at Amazon.com are very difficult for children to shuffle. It would be nice to have a choice of plastic playing cards available even at a higher price. I have always been satisfied with Amazon's products and service.
4,Great Game for all ages,The first time we played this game we were camping in the hills. We played every day for 6 days. Our group of players ranged from age 12-65 years. What a blast. Easy to learn. Very compact and easy to take places.
5,FIVE CROWN CARD GAME,THIS IS A VERY FUN CARD GAME. EASY TO PLAY AND GREAT FOR GROUPS OF ADULTS OR CHILDREN. VERY FAST DELIVERY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING OUR DAY~~AO~~
4,A very good card game,"A very good card game that my teenagers love to play.It is very similar to rummy and requires player to figure out the different card possibilities and strategies to end the game. The only complaint I get is the large number of cards that need to be shuffled for each round. Overall, it has provided good entertainment as well as a thinking exercise to my teenagers and their group of friends."
5,Game lover,This card game is wonderful for the whole family. It is rummy with a twist. It is wonderful to find a game that I can play with my 9 year old son and I am not bored silly. Also a great game to teach others quickly at a party.
4,staying off computers!,"Very refreshing to be introduced to a fun card game by 20-somethings! Nice that the younger generation is finding ways to socialize other than at bars/parties, and not just zonig out in front of a TV. Thanks to Kelly & Chris in CA!! This is a fun game that requires your attention; similar to gin rummy."
1,Poor quality paper,"The game is fun to play, but the quality of the cards are very poor and not worth the money. The card stock is very thin."
4,Five Crowns Card Game,"Five Crowns card game is a fun game similar to gin rummy. It is a fun game for only 2 people or many. Fast moving, a bit of strategy and just plain fun. Easy to learn."
4,Good one,"I played this at a friend's house before buying it, and really enjoyed it. After I bought it, I enjoyed it a bit less. I think four is the right number of players; any more and it's a bit unwieldy. It's a bit like Phase ten, and sort of in the same family of game concepts as Uno. My wife thinks it is a fantastic game."
5,Great card game,This was given to us as a gift. It is very simple to play & great fun.My husband & I play it every night when we have cocktail hour.
5,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I played this game at a birthday party with someones grandma and loved it. Came right home, got it, and still LOVE it!"
5,Game Players,This is a great card game that takes little instruction and can accomodate up to 7 players. It is fun and doesn't require much concentration. It doesn't take a long time to play.
5,Great card game,"My friends and I play card games on a regular basis. This is one of the best card games that we have tried. Really works your brain! Bought one set and I am back to buy more. We wore the cards out playing so much. My friends liked it so much, they have since purchased the game as well. If you enjoy card games, you have to try this one! Has a different concept."
5,Great writing found in between this collector's guide!,"I picked up this book to learn more about vintage ads and magazines I was interested in. I was pleasantly surprised that not only was the book a complete guide to magazines but had great analgoies and stories the ""editors"" wrote within.Great information on a subject that seems to be little explored."
3,Belt Review,"The belt fit good, however it has caused excessive squealing now versus the old one. The tightness adjuster is fine and we have applied squeal stop with no result. One of our close mechanics has informed us that it is the belt itself. Even thought we are happy with it fitting, we are not happy at all with the performance."
5,Graham 7,"Everything as expected with Lego set. Very well received. Would have wanted to know if any ""Lego people"" were included with set."
2,"Well Researched, Poorly Edited","The author presents a well researched account of (mainly) allied naval camouflage through both world wars. I commend his effort, however I feel he was let down by the publisher in the production department. While the text is informative & near comprehensive, the photos are of very poor quality. They were obviously not retouched with Photoshop which I would consider mandatory in this day & age. If the author is reading, I'd suggest Schiffer or another publisher that knows how to do historical photo books. The price of this Naval Institute Press book is obscene considering the poorly put forth photos, which are far too small & far too dark (and fuzzy). For the modeler, I'd suggest the handbook by Patrick Hreachmack, supplemented by the appropriate Squadron/Signal books, etc."
3,disappointed,The book arrived late even though I ordered it in plenty of time. It was much smaller than an ordinary cookbook which makes it incovenient to store with normal cookbooks.
1,waste of money,what a waste of money. nothing new and exciting in this little mini book..not worth the money or hassle it took to get it.
1,worst peppermill ever,"Half the time when you push on the top, springed part of the mill, the bottom half falls off and all the peppercorns go in your food, No, I did not screw the bottom half on improperly! There simply are not enough threads for the bottom half to stay on. Very disappointing."
5,Crafts,My granddaugther loved these items. She is into crafts and loves making things with her hands. This was a great item for her.
1,The box was empty missing EVERYTHING but the loom,"I got this as a gift for my granddaughter for xmas. She was so exited to try it out, and when she oppened the kit, all the accessories were missing. Very disspointing. I was hoping to be able to contact amazon to see they can just send me the missing parts or a replacement. I am ultimately mailing back and empty box.I know that Amazon is very great about their returns but not very easy to get in touch with for this unique situation. I have decided to just return it all together and NOT try for another.Very dissapointed."
5,"I'm not exactly a kid, but I like it anyway","I'm actually a senior citizen and I really like this little loom. It's well-built (very sturdy) and as long as I use yarn I can see it just fine, although my eyes are not the best these days. Tiny thread and needles are a thing of the past for me.The needle they include is great. Has a great big eye so it's easy to thread, even for me. None of my old ones are quite as good, and I wonder where I could get some more like it because I worry about losing it.The only thing I would find fault with is that to me it needs something under it to keep my knees from going through it. I'm not sure how others mamage, but I cut the box that it came in down some and it is (of course) a perfect fit. Lifts right up and even out to get to the underside if I need to, and no more knees poking through! So my advice is ""Don't throw away the box.""Overall, I think it's a very good hobby for almost anybody."
5,Nicely made loom!,"I have experience using table, laptop, and back-strap looms. When it came time to purchase a starter loom for my 10 year old granddaughter, I chose this one and was not disappointed. It is quite sturdy and well made with smooth wooden surfaces. The plastic parts seem well made and well attached. Directions are easy, straight forward, and well illustrated. The included yarn is of a nice quality. This is a well made entry level loom!"
4,A pulp fiction master at work,"A. A. Merritt was a true master of fantasy pulp fiction. The worlds that he created were in a class of their own, detailed, extravagant, mesmerizing. While some of this may have been due to being paid ""by the word"", the results were gratifying to the reader.This particular story is not a typical fantasy. Rather, it falls somewhat into the genre of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Fu-Manchu. ""Satan"" is a criminal lord, dealing in vice and drugs. His followers are motivated by the chance to gain Satan's power through mounting a staircase leading to his throne. If they choose the correct seven steps, they win.""Satan"" is NOT Satan, but he IS a gloriously evil character and very hard to defeat. The story is told through the eyes of the good guy. Who wins? Read the story! If you like Holmes, you will like this!"
3,Just barely...,"I just barely give this 3 stars. I'll admit ""Slam Harder"" rocked my head about 3 summers ago, and I was DYING to get this album. I bought it and was pissed off. The first 4 or 5 tracks were good, then it goes down hill from there. The best song on there is the ""Hold Up"" song with the production from Havoc of Mobb Deep. No where near Onyx's expectations, and not even close to the previous 3 albums that they've made. I haven't given up on them yet, because I'm going to buy Backdafucup, All We Got Iz Us, and Shut Em Down, to hear how they really sound. This album is just unacceptable for any fan."
2,very dissapointing,"I love every onyx album except this one. The rhymes are still tight, but the beats on this album sound too mainstream, like nelly or jay-z, who I hate. I don't know if they changed DJs or something, but I would buy Shut Em Down or All We Got Iz Us before I bought this one. A waste of money."
3,Not up to par but not all that bad...,"I must say that for only having 12 songs it really does a great job the ratio to songs I like to songs I hate is a very big difference. The only songs I dislike are Gangsta, Big Trucks, & Feel me. The songs that I cant stand but aren't the greatest are Calp and Rob 'Em & Onyx is Back. The rest of the tracks are great. I must say That Sticky Fingaz doesnt do the greatest to live up to his verses on past Onyx albums but Fredro steps up a bit. Overall a great album, could have used some more songs but still good..."
3,Kinda dissapointed on this one guys,"Yea so this cd is nothing like the first Bacdafucup they did back in what, 93? Well I guess that really explains why it isnt so great. As Onyx progresses threw their albums, they seem to get less and less gritty and grimmy. I think their first 2 cds were prolly the best sh** I have ever heard from these guys, which are Bacdafucup and All We Got Iz Us. This cd on the other hand, has a new style of beats and has really weak lyrics. They really took away their whole gritty N grimmy hardcore beats and their lyrics just arent as powerful. The songs worth hearing on this cd are Slam Harder, Bang 2 dis, Hood Beef, Bring em out dead, gangsta, and Hold up is an alright song too. Im not saying that I dont like this cd, its just that ever since JMJ died their music hasnt been at its greatest cuz JMJ really made them who they are today. I reccommend getting Bacdafucup first, then All We Got Iz Us, then either get Shut em Down or this cd."
1,Face scrunchingly bad,"It kind of sounded good in theory, yeah sure ONYX 'returns' back to doing stuff that's worth listening to. This is horrible, horrible, weak hackneyed corny stuff you're in for. The backing tracks are so so childish, it makes me think of kids playing on a Fisher Price keyboard. There are slow ballads. There is none of the wild mob black violence cheerleading angst shouts or the angeldust production of the tracks that made the first classic. If you are bored and have some time to kill, then you'd be hard up to spend that time trying to listen or purchasing this CD , when I will tell you here and now , do not buy this crappy CD"
1,THIS CD [is not good],"I have the fisrt 3 Onxy CD's, and I was going to buy this one. I was so excited untill I heard it, and then I was horrified!!!The first 3 cd's start off with yelling and murder skits. But this one is sotfer that a new born baby's azz. They thought they could go all pop-rap, name their CD after one of their hit CD's, and come up with a new hit..... WRONG!!!! This is one of the worse rap CD's I've ever heard, I can't believe these are the same niggAZ that made ""all we got iZ us""."
2,Really bad,onyx has fallen off more then lou begas mambo # 5 hit get the single slam harder the rest is trash beat wise couple signs of grimy onyx but no6 of 10 lyrics 3.5 of 10 beats
2,WHY!?...I Don't Get It!!,"What happen to the raw/shoot em up/just don't give a [you know what] onyx? I still like them, but every track is soft sounding....why did they name there 4th album after the 1st album?..It doesn't have the same vibe like ""Bacdafucup"" ""Bacdafucup II"" sounds like your everyday stuff you here and see on the radio and tv (sweet & weak) If you have this album already and you feel the same way I do, just take or send back ""Bacdafucup II"" and pop the 1st album back in you audio players if you want to hear some ruff and raw onyx that we all know"
3,Well...,"...this is what supposedly be a return album for them. Since they fell off I expected the album to suckass, although keep in mind they were straight fire their first couple of albums. Actually the cd is not as bad as I thought few tracks got me going so I'll give it 3 stars (worth checking out)."
3,average at best,this cd is pretty bad give it up buy the single slam harder its hard to say that cuz i am such a huge fanFavorite Track:Slam HarderGuests:X-15.5 of 10 lyrics 5 of 10 beats
1,Pretty appalling,"I bought all 3 of onyx's last albums and they are the best hip-hop albums iv'e ever heard. Every one of the albums made me nod my head violently, i bloody loved them! This time around onyx has gone puppy dog! they have totally lost their gangsta sound and instead have gone with the times just like every one else. I was appalled by this disgrace of an album, the rapping is pants, and the beats are dreadful. They aren't the hardcore,punching beats as in the other 3 albums, instead they sound more suited to missy elliot or eve. I don't see how anyone who truly likes onyx can actually say this album is worth even 5 pence! ITS SHOCKINGLY BAD! DONT BUY IT!"
1,Ridiculous,"The price of this dvd movie is ridiculous! I have never seen a dvd movie priced this high. I did not buy, but instead rented the movie!"
1,missing,Wish I had the dvd so I could send you a review - I never received the dvd - I tried to contact the seller and got no response -It's been at least 2 months now -What is going on? Please help!!!- I definetely won't order from this seller again!!!
4,Learning Hebrew,"It's a very easy book to use and to learn from. The only thing that is not clear is the sound the vowels make, so you may need some help from a teacher or a friend."
5,I want to know more about Patrick Henry,"I had not realized how much we owe Patrick Henry for the Bill of Rights. There is just enough in this book to encourage me to read further on the myth and reality of Patrick Henry, the fallout with George Washington, and just exactly what was the problem between James Madison and Patrick Henry. This is all briefly discussed in the book. Of course, the book was about Patrick Henry and could not possibly contain all this information. If you want to know just how important Patrick Henry was, and is, read this book. It will start you on a search separating myth from reality."
1,Not wholesome,"Amazon sent me the wrong thing (separate packages of cranberries, tart cherries, and bing cherries--not a dried fruit mixture as advertised) but seeing the ingredient list on these is enough to have me avoid the Melissa brand altogether. Ingredients include high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, juice concentrate, partially hydrogenated oil. Yuck."
1,blueberry candy,"The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal. The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup. A serving is 1/3 of a cup (2 servings per 3 oz package). Each serving contains 22g of sugar and the total carbs are 34%. That's a lot for 1/3 of a cup of blueberries. They offer 2% vitamin A, no vitamin C or iron, and 6% calcium. I bought them to snack on but will try them in cooking after cutting back on other sugar before I throw them out."
5,A scholarly and timely account of some old terrorists,"And the terrorists are not the Mongols! This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to know the mindset of Al Queda. There is a chapter dealing with the origins of the infamous Assassin sect of Islam and their eventual destruction at the hands of the Mongols. Its all here-suicide killers, twisted sense of honor, et al. Curtin takes you all the way back to the death of Mohammed and chronicles the rift in Islam that continues to this day. Of course, this is only a chapter in the story of Mongol conquest, but its worth the price of admission, by itself. The foreward, by President Theodore Roosevelt, (this book was written in 1908!!) should tell you that this is a work of dedicated sholarship."
2,Don't bother choosing a favorite color!,This cover faded to almost no color after one month on my deck.It went from dark green to mint........and not a color I want!I should have chosen a pale color to begin with.Disappointed.It would be better to select the nylor version.
3,Butterfly chair replacement cover,This product looked fine and fit. The problem is the fabric is way to thin. It will not last as long as my last cover.
4,The Ketogenic Cookbook,"As a dietitian who works with children on the Ketogenic Diet, I was delighted to finally see a cookbook with some imaginative options for meals. Each menu has at least one other option for the picky eater and includes menus for holidays and special occasions. The book also includes traveling tips/checklist, a list of hotel chain phone numbers (to check ahead on refrigerators), contact information for food companies and a seizure chart. I would recommend this book to anyone on the Ketogenic diet, but especially for older children or those on the diet over 6 months just looking for new options."
2,Decent book but poor quality,"The book has a few decent suggestions, but don't expect to learn any techniques here. I found it to be good reading with interesting information, but I was looking for something else, hence only 2 stars."
3,Okay...,"The color is a little darker than it appears in the photo, it is less of a sky blue an more of a dark blue. The light ball however is lighter and more gray than the bottom ball while the bar is another shade of blue. Under a UV light, the color is uniform and the ring is comfortable."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","I love the idea and purpose of this book, however the flaps to lift to peek at the bugs are made of flimsy paper. My son tore this immediately. He loves books that he can manipulate and feel and I thought this book would be great for him. Even though he understands to be gentle there was no way the flaps in the book were going to make it. Eventually he tore too many to be able to use."
3,not as exciting as Carter's other books,"This one is not quite as engaging as Carter's other books. As it turns out, more lift the flaps is not necessarily better. My 17 month old likes to open all the flaps, but doesn't get that interested when I label the pictures. She has not yet figured out the idea of turning the wheel and guessing where the bug is on each page. Perhaps slightly older kids would find this more appealing. It is not a pop-up book, only a lift the flap book."
4,Peekaboo Bugs,It is great for parents of little children but I am a pre-school music teacher and wanted it to use in my classes. Not as practical.
5,Very helpful in identifying buttons in my collection.,"Years ago, I inherited a large collection of antique / vintage buttons, and over the years have picked up buttons that I found interesting, too. But I knew little about their history, and wanted to learn more about what I had.Debra Wisniewski's book has been very helpful in identifying buttons, and learning how they're classified and constructed. The photos are large, and in color. There are many categories presented here, from 200-year old buttons to modern ones, in all descriptions of materials from metal to organic materials, to plastics.It would be impossible to include every type of button ever made, but I found that ""Antique and Collectible Buttons"" contained a very good, and wide representation of buttons.It's been very useful to me, and has helped spur my desire to learn more about - and collect more! - buttons."
3,Fine shape,"The book we received was in fair condition. We saved money on buying it used. It had been from a library, so it was not in perfect condition, rather fair. Thank you."
4,Great introductory book!,"This is an inexpensive introductory book for the button collector or sewing enthusiast. It contains wonderful color photos and more up-to-date pricing than the older classics. I also recommend Peggy Osborne's Button Button book, and more serious enthusiasts should also invest in the bible of all button collectors - The Big Book of Buttons by Hughes and Lester."
2,lacks detail,"This book is mostly comprised of full page pictures of buttons. Many of the pictures are accompanied by a note that gives a range of prices for all the buttons in the picture. I had hoped for some information about what characteristics make a button more or less valuable than another. It mentions that there are different styles of shank and construction, but says nothing about why or when each style was used. I had also hoped for information about estimating the date of manufacture."
3,Synopsis with British market in mind,"A good basic book, mainly for the U.S. market. As a British button collector, I found it of limited use due to most illustrated buttons being manufactured in America. However, the illustrations were clear and information fairly concise though more dates and background information re. manufacture would have been useful. I am based in Yorkshire, England with an interest in all glass, and golden age buttons, but found no mention specifically of the latter. The over-all approach was user-friendly and would be of particular interest to all collectors of American buttons"
3,Useful But A Little Dry,"This book covers everything in detail except what really interests me, plastic buttons that aren't made of the early, valuable plastics like Bakelite and Catalin. However, what she does cover is profusely illustrated and her pictures are clear."
4,Gentle on my Mind/ I Take A Lot of Pride,This is a really nice collection of twenty songs from Dean that is sure to please. I like Dean's version of Honey better than the original. This will be a nice addition to your collection.
5,One of Dino's best at Reprise,"This is an excellent set of 2 Repirse albums, and probablu my ultimate favorite out of those released. Dino is in fine form, his warm, soothing voice caressing the fine tracks!"
4,Dean's CD with some songs that are unavailable elsewhere,"Not his best CD, but worth having because there are some songs that are not available elsewhere."
1,When at the top of ratings you are the target,"Since The Factor (and Fox News) has dominated the cable news ratings (even if you combine CNN, MSN, etc. together) for years, people will always try to make money by targeting the top show. O'Reilly always puts up the ""commentary"" title (unlike the mainstream media and other cable news networks, i.e., 75% of Americans believe the media slanted their coverage of the recent election to support President-Elect Obama) when puting forth his personal opinion, and if you watch the show he takes on both sides of the issue while still advocating the ethics and values that made the United States a good force in the world. I bought this to see if I was missing something; however, it served to just support my analysis that his show, overall, The Factor is outstanding."
2,Cashing in on O'Reilly's name,"Sensationalism sells. No two ways about this. Mr. Hart realized this, and cashed in on Bill O'Reilly's popularity.Apparently, those who hate O'Reilly have neither watched his show, nor read his books, for those paint a very different story than this book.If you want a manual on how to hate Bill O'Reilly, you've got the right book.If you actually want some substantiated arguments without sensationalism, look elsewhere.Only in the far-left's world would a pro-gun control, anti-death penalty, pro-choice, anti-""corporate weasel"", bipartisan basher be considered a ""far-right conservative."""
1,Even 3 paragraphs show the inaccuracy,"Hart disputes O'Reilly's claim that the US ""gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else....."" by countering that per capita the U.S. is near the bottom of the list. O'Reilly wasn't quoted as saying ""more tax money per capita"".More goofy reasoning by someone who ought to know better."
1,I've Read the Book - Hypocrisy at its Core!,"I was unfortunate enough to endure FAIR's ""The Way Things Aren't"", a book of 100 of Rush Limbaugh's mistakes. The fact that ANY radio personality has made a mere 100 notable mistakes should be cause for celebration; most aren't that accurate. Most of these errors, in addition, are tiny mistakes, or mere areas where FAIR disagrees with the commentator.But I'm getting off topic. This new book latches onto a few errors of Bill O'Reilly. For instance, he confused two radio awards for a short period. These awards were about equivalent, but were latched onto by the media as evidence of a lying streak.If you want to read this kind of junk, go right ahead. FAIR.org stands with Al Franken, Ann Coulter, and others as vicious fact-omitting mudslingers with little room for pity."
1,Spinning liberal heat,"This is a fun book, thin, but amusing in its own way. Bill O'Reilly is someone that is easily hated by the left. He is popular, well-educated, well-exposed to the public and lets the clowns out there have it. Are most of the clowns liberal Democrats? Well, ""liberal Democrat"" and ""clown"" is a tautology, and so the answer would be 'yes', but deciding that Bill O'Reilly is in the same camp as Rush Limbaugh is off the mark, as he really doesn't seem to like either Anne Coulter Donald Rumsfeld or several other conservative marks. I would consider him to be strongly conservative, however much Bill denies this. The crux of the book is that conservative-bad, liberal-good and with that in mind, the sky is the limit here.Read it with expectations of hearing what Al Franken has to say, but expect less of it and fewer smiles along the way (but for roughly the same price)."
1,Dissatisfied,"I think the book was a waste of money!!!I don't remember reading sooo much rhetoric in my life.It's like the author just doesn't like O'Reilly so he writes negative and untrue things about the man.Trust me, don't buy the book, you'll ask for your money back!!!!!!"
1,Peter Hart not credible,"""...uh, Bill if you feel so strongly about this, why don't you tell that same retailer to quit selling your book on their site - after all do you want to be associated with such a company?"".Bill O' was right. That WAS a preposterous correlation!Writers such as Peter Hart, lack enough worldly experiences from which to draw any rational, objective opinions."
4,good for the uninformed,This book is terrific for those who have never watched O'Reilly and need to be aware of the dire need for media reform in the United States and for those who have watched O'Reilly as their only source of news and have no idea that he's spouting lies.
1,Save your money,Just didn't work for us. Have loved every other ELMO or SESAME STREET dvd. Not this one!
2,Don't care for it,"My 3 year old loves Elmo and there was barely any Elmo at all. It was not entertaining enough to keep him engaged in it, he asked for a different video."
3,Not a big fan,"My 18 month old loves elmo- got him this video not his favorite there's not enough elmo, he likes bert and ernie but not enough to watch the entire video."
1,Wrong DVD's!!,"When the package came, I myself was excited. My daughter adores Elmo and I knew that this box set would be perfect. That's when everything went horribly wrong. I opened the dvd case and noticed that there were just 2 random episodes of Sesame Street. We were extremely disappointed. Amazon is a great company and I'm sure that this was a mistake, it just sucks to take the time to order something and then not get what you want."
1,Wrong DVD's,Wrong dvd's inside case which was suppose to be brand new! I ordered a new one thinking it was a mistake and the new one came in with different DVDs again!
3,That's not a phoenix,"Anybody familiar with the desert will recognize the road runner in this pendant. I don't know why the description calls it a phoenix. Perhaps the person got confused because they got it from Phoenix, Arizona?"
4,This is a MUST GET cd! Don`t pass this up!,"I`ve reviewed this cd, it`s w.a.s.p. going back to the ""good old days"". I heard the preview, and now I MUST buy it! Can`t wait to hear the rest!DO NOT PASS UP THIS AWESOME CD!It is a w.a.s.p. MUST GET! You`ll be sorry if you don`t get this one. Already a classic, in my book!"
3,"A DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT STILL HAS SOME GOOD MOMENTS","This record is strictly for W.A.S.P. hadcore fans (I'm one of these). Some songs (especially the embarassing and revolting ""Dirty Balls"") take the term ""shock metal"" to an abysmal low. However, there some glimpses of Blackie's past glory in this one (""Damnation Angels"" and the title track, for instance). Oh, gosh, how I miss the old W.A.S.P.!"
2,"Sing Blackie, please sing!","I bought my first wasp lp in 1984, i LOVE them. I LOVE the sound of Blackies voice. But on this album...he just dont sing, all he does is scream, scream, scream. Too bad, i would have liked this cd otherwise."
4,FUN,"The reviews on this are so evenly split it's funny! Granted there is nothing new or original on here but this album is FUN! Don't Cry (Just Suck), Dirty Balls, and Cocaine Cowboys will have you singing along in no time. Damnation Angels is so good it doesn't really even belong on this album. To all the naysayers all I can say is that I bet if this was released before or after Last Command you'd all eat it up. I try to not place a time period on music and just enjoy it for what it is. I think what hurts this album is that Crimson Idol was so damned good and also the production of this album is absolute rubbish. I like how WASP can be serious on one album then just have a party on another, it's what keeps them interesting. This is a total party album."
2,Not even close,"This can't be Wasp can it? What a pathetic excuse for a Wasp album. Nothing on here made me want to turn it up. I love early Wasp and when it's on... it's loud. This disc only annoyed me, I'm sorry but Blackie was Ball Less on this instead of Lawless."
2,Not close to Blackie's best........poor sound etc.,"This album is not what I wanted to hear. Production is poor and the overall content is not worth the [money] that I spent. Great band live, they are excellant. WASP is one of my top 5 bands, but this album is not worth the cashola..........."
1,W.A.S.P. reduced to AC/DC tribute status,"This record is nothing more than Blackie Lawless chickening out. W.A.S.P.'s KFD was and is the best record released in years, but when W.A.S.P.'s single-digit IQ fans couldn't handle its sophistication, Blackie decided that sounding like AC/DC or early KISS was the right career move. Trust the guy who covered ""Somebody to Love"" to pander. This record is so derivative that I'm surprised it didn't come with KISS Army entry forms. There isn't an original thought on the thing. ""Damnation Angels"" is a ""Hell's Bells"" ripoff. ""Dirty Balls"" could have come straight from ""Rock and Roll Over."" Any high school 80s metal cover band could perform this record start to finish (and probably has). Boring. Blackie's excuse for this travesty is that he wanted to sound like the band did in its early days. Excuse me, Mr. Lawless, but Chris Holmes never sounded like Ace Frehley before. Or wrote like him either. What's your next cover, ""Black Diamond?"""
2,Not was I stung by WASP,"Well... It's ok. ""Helldorado"" is incredibly catchy, but the rest of the album fails to deliver. WASP is good, but try another album."
2,10x better than KFD / 1000x worse than Unholy Terror,"Blackie Lawless should be ashamed of this release. I am a huge WASP fan, but like KFD, this cd is total garbage. Two songs are concert worthy, thats it. Save your money and pick it up at used cd warehouse, but do not spend [money] on this crap."
4,Great drinking music,"This is an album with a purpose: you listen to it while getting drunk. Don't try to enjoy this one sober, it ain't ""thinking man's music"" as some previous albums such as Crimson Idol or Headless Children were. The album kicks off with a well paced rocker Helldorado to set you in the good mood for opening the bottle. Then we go through all the stupidities people do when they are partying a tad too drunk. Sex, fighting, obscenities, and so on. The whole idea is that we are all going to h*ll anyway, so why not go in flames and blazing! Finally, the disc ends with a reprise of the starting song Helldorado, this time not so smoothly produced, sounding more rough and tumbly, kept a bit simpler altogether. Just what you need after drinking your booze and it elevates your spirits high enough to bring a big grin on your face. By this time you should be finishing your bottle and getting ready go out for more partying through the night."
5,Great for pattern focused people,"Great both to play competitively as well as cooperatively and for all ages. I have played with my children since they were 5 or 6 and we vary the game by using more or fewer cards at a time to decrease or increase the challenge. While we can play many of the packaged card games with a regular deck of cards, this one definitely needs the Set deck. This has been a very durable game-- we return to replay on a regular basis."
5,SET is an excellent pattern-based game,"I got hooked on SET a year ago or so and have been wanting my own game ever since. SET challenges you to find patterns in both intuitive and somewhat non-intuitive ways, improves your visual skills and your ability to categorize items, is highly transportable, and a lot of fun. It's a game that bridges age and language differences. Everyone can play...and once you get them hooked, they will. Again, and again, and again..."
5,One of the best card games alive!!!,"This is a really great game that requires great concentration and thought. If you want to improve your logic and concentration in real life, playing this game will help you. The whole point of the game is to make sets of three cards by looking at 12 cards and seeing of certain things will work. This is a challenging game that will keep you having fun for hours!!"
5,The best game ever,We had hours of fun playing this game and our age range was 6 to 61. You must buy this game.
4,"Fun, but not suitable for the Red-Green Colorblind","I love this game, but the choice of colors was unfortunate. Many members of my family are Red-Green colorblind.It would be nice if they did like the makers of Uno did and change their dyes to make the red and green more distinct."
5,All ages can play together--great family game!,"This is on my list of must own games. It's a classic game that you'll always want around. I am constantly on the look out for games that will help train my kids' brains to see things in new ways and also provide some good family time. Set works for every age, all reading levels, and breaks language barriers (you can play this in any country). I enjoy playing with my kids or with other adults. Since the game is a deck of cards, it's easy for travel.I watched as a friend of one of my kids made fun of the game. I understood that child ""didn't get it"" so I made the deck easier so she could learn the concept and to get her started. It did not take long for her to understand and grow with it. Every kid deserves the ""leg up"" of using their brains in different ways. Play Mozart, but play Set too.Aunt LayaAuthor of the best loved self help book for teens, ""You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way"""
3,Discouraging for young ones,"I bought this game for my 5.5 year old and it's definitely not a favorite. She has a difficult time identifying the four similiar and dissimiliar patterns on three identical cards, as do I and her dad. There is so much to think about that she gets frustrated, particularly when we have to constantly point out that she didn't make a match. While I think it has wonderful educational value, there is an enormous learning curve to consider when introducing it to kids. This is one game we'll probably put away for a couple of years and try again when she's older."
5,Great for kids of all ages and their parents too!,SET is great fun for the entire family! I played it with a four year old that I was baby-sitting and she almost beat me! Honestly! We really had a lot of fun. SET teachs pattern recognition that is important to the learning process so it makes it ideal for young children. It is also a social game so it is fun (and challenging) for adults. I like the other games offered by Set Enterprises including FIVE CROWN and QUIDDLER. They are a lot of fun and make a great gifts.
4,A fun game of pattern recognition,"Set is a fun game with simple rules that improves your pattern recognition skills. It is easy to carry around, being only slightly larger than a deck of cards.The games can become one-sided though, if one player is significantly better than the others. In this case, a time handicap (eg a 3 second delay) or tweaking the scoring (eg different players need different number of sets to win) can help balance the games."
5,intellectually satisfying,"Set is a fantastic game. My husband and I love to play in the evening. But don't play with people looking over your shoulder because they can't seem to help saying ""I see a set,"" which drives me insane. If you're looking for a good way to pass the time, or to unwind, and you don't like idle behavior, this is the game for you. I do wonder if color blind people can play, though, because two of the colors are green and red. Wouldn't they not be able to tell them apart? Seems like they could have foreseen that and chosen orange or something."
5,SET is great fun for all ages!,"It can take a little while to catch on, but once you do, SET is great fun! It is great for visual learners. I have taught this game to all different ages and everyone enjoys it!"
3,"It's an educational learning tool, not a game","Bought this game based on reviews on this site. We love Euchre and other strategy card games. We played this once and it was so boring....it reminded of me of doing flash cards with my kids. It's educational, yes. Great for helping kids learn patterns and visual discrimination BUT it's not for a group of adults and teens having a fun evening. It sits in a drawer waiting to use with grandchildren when they're about 8."
5,fun for our kids and our friends,"This card game was recomended through my homeschool support group. I started out playing it with my 8-year old son, who got the hang of it quite easily from checking out the website for the Set game (www.setgame.com/set). Then, my 6-year old daughter peeked in on us and started finding sets, so she joined in. When I play with adult friends (who can get a bit argumentative and aggressive, by the way), we can let the game go on for quite a while, with folks coming and going from the game as they please. With the kids, we set a timer for 30 minutes and count up our cards at the end. Since this is a card game, I like to take it in my bag to keep us busy in doctors' offices and on car trips (we need a cookie tray to keep the cards from sliding all over)."
5,Love this game,"I love this game. My husband introduced me to it 15 years ago. It was part of our courtship. Ha ha ha. I'm fascinated by watching children play this game and seeing how they play this game. Once I took it to a holiday celebration with the family of some friends of mine. For years I had watched the dynamics of their family (one branch had two children who were labled as Gifted and Talented, another branch had two children who were labeled as special needs). The fascinating thing is that the ""special needs"" kids beat the pants off their cousins. First time they'd ever been better than their cousins at anything. It was very interesting. They could see the patterns without overthinking it."
3,Challenging,"I find it amazing children could play this. I find this game challenging at times, especially in the beginning. My friends and I were just stared at these cards for minute after minute. It requires a lot of patience, and after a while my brain shuts off. Now, that could be a good thing. Unlike most games it works your brain, eye perception and visualization. Playing it by myself in high school, I did attract attention, but most people gave up before finding a single set. Simple reason: often they are extremely hard to spot. You have to continually go through a metal process of elimination to find sets. You can't just blankly stare until they pop out. Instead, you have to really actively search -which after a long time gets tiring. I did enjoy this game but only when the occasion arises. Unfortunately there isn't much group interaction in the game... you just watch the cards and pick out sets. I think it works better as a solo game for when you're bored."
2,not for the red-green color blind,"The open symbols are drawn with thin lines, and the cards use red and green as two of the colors. Red-green color blindness is fairly common, about 5% of males have it. And those who are red-green color blind can't play this game. I hope the game is reissued someday with a different set of colors."
3,Not Versatile,"This game is definitely not for everyone. Some people do love the game, but others will find it frustrating and not fun. The game takes a lot of concentration, and I'd contest that it's not really ""fun"", it's just slightly addicting. I personally enjoy playing it on occasion, but not when I'm just out for mindless fun. On a final note, when playing games with friends I notice a lot less laughter and more animosity between the group when we play Set than when we play another game such as pictionary, Canasta or Cranium."
5,Game for 8 and up!,"This is a game that is fun for everyone, but probably better suited for people over the age of 8-- or it could be frustrating for them. This was a great game to get high school age kids involved and playing with the rest of the family at a gathering."
5,Great Game,SEt is a great game that is fun for kids and adults alike. I like it because you can play it with turns or you can play it by who sees the set first. I think this is a great educational tool because it uses both sides of the brain. I like to take it when we travel.
4,Have to get the hang of it,"Great game once you get the hang of it; it took my family a little while to pick up on the sets to look for, but once we did, it is a great quick after dinner game. Takes about 10 minutes or so to play a round, and the competition really heats up. My 11 and 15 year old were both equally skilled at it."
5,Engaging,"I have loved this game for years and now I finally have my own. I am currently teaching my five year old how to play by starting out with only one color. Great game, makes you frantically think."
5,Fun game!,So easy to learn but fun to play!! A great game for all ages. We took it to family functions and it was always a hit.
5,"very fun, even my then 4 year old can play competitively","It is a fun game, it is kind of interesting to see even my then 4 year old can play competitively. You can even play on line when you go to their official site."
3,Set Card Game,"This is a game that is more challenging than it first appears. It utilizes matching / grouping and memory skills. It is good to have out when chatting with friends. It's more of a challenge / mind game than fun & exciting type game. If you're playing by yourself, it might be better to play on a computer, so there's no cards to put away & it does take up some space to lay out all the cards."
4,SET game,"This is a really fun game. It's one that is not too hard, but makes you think. I think that the makers of the game even suggested math uses for it. We really like to play this game as a family. It was shipped in good time - but I have some issues with the shipping - they won't ship a game to Hawaii, so I had to have it shipped to family on the mainland, then pay to have it shipped here to HI. What a pain! I would understand the issue if the game was oddly shaped, but it isn't. We live in the US too with the same mail system. Anyway, besides the shipping issues, I'd recommend this game."
3,"I like this game, but my family doesnt...","My child and husband wont play it with me because I see all the sets almost as soon as the cards are turned. It is way too easy for me and my husband and child have a very hard time finding the sets. They are very smart people, but for some reason at this game we are to unevenly matched to play. They can play it just them too, but they don't like the game much."
1,This game is not fun,"Yeah, spending time staring at cards until your brain hurts. It's not fun. I can't imagine making your kids do this. You are terrible parents if you buy this for your children."
5,"Simple concept, Very fun game","This is a pretty fun card game. It's deceptively simple. Each card has a symbol on it. Each symbol has 4 traits: number, pattern, shape, and color. To score points, you just have to find sets of 3 that either match or don't match in these traits.Sounds simple, right? Well, it is. Sort of. But the game is more complex than that, and to try and describe it would just sound confusing. But it requires both a sharp eye and the ability to recognize patterns. The good news is as you play you find yourself getting better at it.It's easy to customize it to a simpler game for beginners, and it doesn't take long to play. Overall, a cool little game."
5,Challenging and Fun,"Unlike so much of what is out there for providing entertainment, the card game SET is not only fun but challenging. It really sharpens your mind. It is a very versatile game, too; as few as one person can play it, yet there is no upper limit on the number of players. It's portable. No turns, either -- whoever sees a SET can call it. All in all a very fun and addictive game."
5,Great,Its a great game. Its a fun way of learning. Easy way of explaining set concepts. My 4 year old loves this game.
5,A great game,"SET is a great card game for all ages. It teaches kids about patterns and it keeps the adult mind sharp. Of course, the adults will be frustrated because the kids will learn it quickly and beat them every time. My eight year old daughter is a wiz. It is a quick game so you can use it as a filler for any down time, at home or on the road."
5,Great Game,"The game was difficult to understand at first. When we finally understood the directions, we had a great time. It takes practice to get good at it."
5,best simple family game ever,"do not pass up this brilliant card game. its simplicity, ingenuity, and eventual competitiveness make it engrossing for hours on end."
5,Stimulating game for thinkers,"This is a terrific game - fun in a group, but also entertaining alone. It exercises the brain and can be addictive! It makes a great gift for children and adults alike."
3,Educational-not fun!!!!!,"This ""game"" is truly only a deck of standard sized cards in a case. It was purchased by a very game playing family of four, and mom is the only one who somewhat likes it. It's not because it's too hard (once you get the hang of it), it's just not very entertaining. I've tried it with both kids and adults, and both groups would rather choose any other game in the house. We love most games and puzzles, and this one just didn't cut it. I'm really surprised with the number of positive reviews."
5,Set game great!!,We thoroughly enjoyed this game. Played by ages 8 to 71 with everyone participating fully. It is a great game for concentration and working the grey matter.
3,So so...,You need the right group of people to play with.Not everyone like this kind of games.I like it but my friends... sigh.
5,Fun brain exercise for all ages - My family loves this game!,"Our family loves this game more than any other game we've played together. Our 4-year-old plays right along with the rest of us. It is an engaging exercise in pattern matching that provides equal footing for players of all ages (ages 4-5 and up).Our seven-year old can win this game against her elders without any ""special rules"" or other such condescensions. Usually games that young children can realistically play and win are based on chance and don't involve much thinking.This game is based on the ability to mentally organize four categories and is quick and easy to learn, without waiting turns and without many rules to learn. These features also make it very easy to play with people who have never played it before. There is not much they need to know before starting the game. (Hint: study the examples on the box to jump-start your understanding.)An excellent game, just excellent!"
3,Its ok,"SO I ordered this for a LARP character that I have, I ordered this because it looked very girly and it would annoy some of the folks I game with.Its not a bad buy, the material is very shiny and its soft and comfortable. It comes to just a bit above my ankles, im 5'10.Overall this item is not bad. Nothing to brag about but the price is right. The seller however was prompt, and delivery was right on time. Professional service."
3,To small,"Cloak is nicely made,but Adult size, ok if your five foot tall and a hundred pounds.I did manage to make it useable by cutting off the button and sewing a small piece of chain with hooksin place of the button and button hole"
5,great cape,This cape is very durable. I wear it often. It is comfortable and I would buy more from the seller.
5,Exodus's Master of Puppets,"Kill 'em All lifted to the next level. This is what this album is in Exodus terms. Killer production, BUY!"
4,Another classic!!,"This cd was the first with Souza on vocals and its not a disappointment. Actually I like his style better than Pauls but this is not better than Bonded by Blood. It has some kick ass songs but it seems like they were trying to hard with this. It is one of my favorite discs with Souza on vocals but I prefer ""Fabulous Disaster"" or ""Impact is Imminent"" to this. If you can find ""Impact is Imminent"" then you should definitely buy it because THAT is a Thrash Masterpiece that kills you from song 1 till the end and never lets up! That is a 5 star cd!!"
5,another great exodus effort :D,"if i didnt say before exodus is one of my fav bands of all time...so every big fan of em should have every one of their albums.this is what ppl say a dissapointment from the classic bonded by blood album...but those ppl who say that this album sucks are firmly addicted to one of the crappiest bands ever called linkin park (no offence).now this in my opnion is an awesome follow up...and i think zetro is as good as baloff.the best songs are brain dead,pleasures of the flesh,deranged,'til death do us part,chemi-kill lots of great classic songs in here.if you dont own this and if you dont like it your no fan of exodus or thrash metal...your just one of those linkin park fans."
2,Talk about a fall from grace!! This album SUCKS!!,"Wow, to go from Bonded by Blood to this!!Trust me, this album sucks. The songs aren't catchy or cool. The lyrics are lame. Souza's voice is crappy. If you want a decent album from this lineup (Souza on vocals) check out Fabulous Disaster. Forget this one."
3,"Will last forever, but...","These guards look nice, come in a great case, and will probably last forever. However, they have broken a couple teeth off of my clipper blades. I'll be switching back to plastic."
2,OK,It is ok but it is not the best thing you can get if you want to find stuff out about Hilary Duff.
5,"Beautifully done Hil, keep up the great work...","Hialry Duff is brilliant, she truly is capitolizing on her popularity, the way the Olsen twins did in the late 90's, with the preteen crowd. Duff is a good influence on girls and is a classy young lady with many talents such as singing, acting, dancing, and modeling. She is a friendly and personable young gal, not to mention beautiful. I think many older teen girls who are jelous of her talent, popularity and beauty are levaing bad reviews, just out of jelousy. Don't listen to them, this dvd is great and shows the real Hilary who is beautiful on the inside and out!"
3,"There's not much in it, prior to what you may think...","If you ask me, they released this DVD at a bad time in Hilary's career. Soon after her fans paid money to get her videos on DVD, her music video ""Come Clean"" came out. Stupid or what? This should have been released at least after her next single, as kind of a memoir to all Hilary's work. The home videos are interesting, but they're too short. The rest is all from TV or movies. A lot of these shorts have played on MTV or Lizzie DVDS, so other than the home videos you won't find much else that you've never seen, provided you're a big fan."
1,Great if you are easily entertained and satisfied,"This DVD is a great example of how Hilary gets by on her looks. Includes making and videos of ""So Yesterday""/""Why Not"", and a short version of the video ""I Can't Wait"". Includes home videos and photos of Hilary when she was younger, and less annoying. As far as Hilary in the studio, it includes performances of ""Little Voice"" and ""So Yesterday"" which are both lip synched, as anyone who has common sense could tell that. They also show bits of performances of some other songs on her album, also lip synched. So you see no live singing here. Just Hilary faking it."
4,This dvd was great but......,This dvd was great but it should be longer and i loved how they put pic of her when she was little.
3,"Good, even if you're not really a fan","i'm not a big fan of Hilary's but i still really enjoyed this DVD. My sister LOVES her and she bought the DVD as soon as it came out! Like I already said, i wasn't a big fan of hers but after seeing the DVD I actually like her a little more. The home videos are a little short but they let you see more of her than you'd see anywhere else."
1,AWFUL!!,"Who buys this garbage?! How this girl was given a record deal is beyond me because she lacks any modicum of talent! She's nothing but a marketing machine like Britney Spears was at one point, however she lacks the talent Britney has. Don't waste your money on this crap, I guarantee you'll regret it!!"
5,Great book and kit,"I just received this and I was very impressed. Along with the book (beautiful designs that can be expanded on), it comes with 20+ sheets of paper, a measuring grid (plastic-type material), a folding tool and several types of templates (for cards, mini envelopes, etc.; durable material). I can't wait to get started making cards."
2,Best For Kids,"I ordered this book used and did not get some of the materials that come with the book. The featured cards are ""cute"" and probably best for young girls. Not a wide variety otherwise but for the right person it could be good."
3,Is it helpful?,"Expected dimensions of book to be bigger - the same size as other craft books I have. Best thing about book is it showed me how to do a 'pop-up' card, 3-d card to name but a few."
4,card making,KLUTZ does it right...and every time does it right. This is a beautifully done book on card making whether a beginner or an experienced crafter. A wonderful addition for that child or grandchild who is beginning to explore his/her creativity.
2,"Very dissappointed - good music, but NO Celine Dion singing","CD is very misleading, since one expects to hear Celine Dion singing most of her hits. The music is OK, but not what I had hoped for or expected. Now I know why there was no audio sound available."
4,Music of Celine Dion,It is wonderful background music for entertaining and listening. Also very enjoyable for relaxing by the fireplace.
3,VERY GOOD !! BUT!!!,"I'VE BEEN A CELINE FANS FOR 9 YEARS AND THIS WOULD BE AGOOD C.D.FOR THE CELINE BEGINNER, THE REASON I SAY BUT IS THEY FORGOT 2 BEAUTIFUL SONGS THAT WERE BOTH HER LAST U.S. # 1""S AND THAT BEING 1.) I'M YOUR ANGEL AND 2.) MY HEART WILL GO ON :-) CAN'T FORGOGET THOSE # 1""S RIGHT FOLKS!!!"
5,Great Book!,This book is well stocked with information! Many sample projects included as well as a separate guide in the back of the book for all kinds of stitches. Very easy to follow. Invaluable.
2,The Kin of Ata are tedious,I thought this book was very clumsily written and I was not impressed with the philosophies it contains. I felt like I had taken a tour through a Californian asylum by the time I was done.This is the sort of book you might enjoy if you enjoyed the Celestine Prophecy and its pop-psychology in a new dress...or the racist fiction Mutant Message Downunder and its belief in the Primal Wisdom Of The Simple-Headed Little Natives.The Kin of Ata bring very little of value.
4,Review of The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You,I had read this book some years back and I liked it then and wanted to re-read it. I don't know what happened to my original copy. My meditation teacher had recommended this book. Very trippy!!
5,Forever changed,"There are no words to describe the immense affect this book can deliver to the reader. The spiritual implications and subtle teachings interlace with this beautiful story that you will never forget. I read this book about 20 years ago or so, and it still remains at the top of my list."
5,Avatar Movie Similar To The Kin of Ata Are Waiting For You,I read this book in 1990 and just loved it. I felt it touched me in a way that only things that offer a profound level of depth can. I recently saw the movie Avatar and could not help but think how similar the messages are and wondered if James Cameron had been influenced by it.
5,"Finished in one sitting, opened to page 1 and read it again!",I loved this book. The peaceful denizens of Ata have much to teach us. I carried the lessons with me for weeks and then reread it again.
5,a blueprint for a new civilization,"For anyone committed to a return to tribal values, to alternative healing modalities, to the power of dreams, this novel is a sourcebook. It shows the way to cure our emotional chaos and our spiritual poverty, and a builds a model for the post-nuclear family age."
3,energyless,"oh what can one say about batteries? Well, I went through the whole pack too quickly cause the juice in them run out too fast. Rayovac needs to improve on their batteries. But the company i bought them from was great... quick delivery, but people please note: shipping was more than the cost of the batteries. Buy bulk or buy at local store."
4,Hard to find movie!,"Over Her Dead Body is a very difficult movie to find. If you look for it on other websites, they bring up a movie with different actors that I am not interested in. This movie from the 80's was a dark comedy about a couple who were having an affair. They think that they accidently killed off the wife. The mayhem escalates from there....lots of fun."
4,"Great acting & interesting story,worthwihile to see!","This film takes place in Africa at the end of the British rule there. It is an interesting film based on the director's childhood there. You'll feel for Ralphie, when he is happy and when he is sad. Without ruining the film for you, at times, there are funny scenes, but most of them are sad. Emily Watson and Gabriel Byrne, as in previous films they've starred in are outstanding in this one. Their performances are outstanding. Miranda Richardson portrays the adulterous s*** you will definitely love to hate. Emily Watson and Gabriel Byrne, as usual in their previous films each give an outstanding performance in this film. It is not a fantastic film, but I'd watch it again and don't hesitate recommending it to others. Overall, a worthy film to watch once or twice, or maybe more."
2,Respectfully disagree with the 5s,The acting in this movie is terrific. In fact I bought it because of Emily Watson and Gabriel Byrne. But the story didn't hang together for me. Sorry ... I can't recommend it.
4,Typical (good) Slednecks video,"Great sled action, high production value, and they have removed all the ramp jump garbage for the other video. This is yet another solid video from the Slednecks franchise. I would recommend it without hesitation to all sledheads out there looking for a fix while waiting for the snow to fall. Man, they should hire me for PR :)"
2,Shipping problems,I purchased these taco shells for a large party. Over half of the shells were damaged in shipping and brooken in half along their spine. I kept the undamaged shells and they tasted fine.
4,DIGGLE JUST KEEPS ON ROCKIN!,"I really like this guy. Both with the Buzzcocks and solo, Steve Diggle has shown a real consistency of songcraft. He's not averse to adding a few new touches here and there (harmonica, electronics, ballads, etc), but with every release, you basically know you're going to hear some good, solid rock `n' roll. This CD is no exception. It's quite strong through all 13 tracks - not a bad one in the bunch. Lots of loud guitars, a little more ""groove"" oriented than previously, where he lays down a verse or two, then goes off into a guitar solo wonderland, at times almost approaching Neil Young/Crazyhorse intensity. The lyrics are ""personal"" (as mentioned in the liner notes by Alan Parker) but vague enough not to be too literal. Rather, they evoke a mood with each song, which you can overlay your own emotional history. Fun stuff, and well worth a listen. Keep it up, Steve!"
3,Eh...not so much...,"The story feels a bit rushed and the characters aren't all that interresting...though I like the mangaka's other works, namely FAKE, this one seemed almost like she didn't write it. It was choppy in places and just an over all boring read. I didn't even keep my copy, I gave it to a used book store."
2,What was the point?,"Probably a good book in the abstract but for those of us in the real world, not very useful.The book is out-of-touch with reality and seems to take on a niave, inexperienced approach that resonates with Ivory Tower insecurities and paternalism.A much better book in this same genre is Steven Casey's ""Set Phasers on Stun.""It gets the point across succinctly in an entertaining manner and without all the patronizing preaching from the podium."
5,Miss Spider's beautiful family,"Miss Spider and her family show us how to have fun together while teaching manners and helping young children to understand their own feelings about adoption. The use of a ""buggy"" family with different bugs to tell an adoption story is less threatening to young children. Specifically, the Family Tree episode deals with the different feelings that children of the same family can face regarding their adoption story. After watching this series my own adoptive and birth children have role played the scenes and in listening to their fantasy role playing I've learned what they themselves are currently struggling with from missing birth families, wondering why we don't all look the same and questions that their friends may be asking that they don't know how to answer. Miss Spider has opened many doors of dialog for us. If you, or a family your are close to, have adopted or are considering adopting young children this would be a great addition to your DVD library."
4,No Limit's last good album.,"This is Master P's best album. Even non No Limit fans could appreciate this CD. It was the last time P put it down over quality beats (produced by Al Eaton and Ken Franklin, NOT the wack, recycling company, Beats By The Pound), with motivating, orignial rhymes (he doesn't sound like a 2pac imatator on this CD). Too bad none of his newer albums sound anything like this."
4,17 Reasons,"Nice cd yo!For those of us who picked it up the first time we know why P is the most powerful man in rap today.He's been askin' ""Ya heard me?"" for years and I thinks it's time you late bloomers paid attention.Pick it up"
2,Ok if someone gave it to you,"This album isn't really worth the money unless you have a lot of extra money to spend. Tracks #3, #4, #5, #9, and #11 are alright but there's too many commercials for an album containing 13 tracks."
3,I give this cd three stars,"The music is good but the cover says featuring the single & VIDEO ""When They Gone"" Where's the video. I put it in the computer nothing happens. It says to call 1-900 Master P in the book and you can talk to Master P and some of the no limit girls like Mercedes and people and it's FAKE. I tried it and it doesn't even work. Without those two problems it would have five stars. The music is da bomb though. It could be the best CD if they wouldn't avertise things that are fake! No video for ""When They Gone"" and No 1-900 Master P. But the songs are really good. If you don't have it you should get it but I just want to tell you there's video and don't dill 1-900 Master P. The songs are really good through. ""When They Gone"", ""99 Ways To Die"", & ""Dead Presidents"" are the best songs on it. The commercial interludes are halarious too."
2,Shows where he started.,"I consider myself the world's most devout P fan, but when I bought this, my heart shattered. There are only 2 good songs on the whole recording, ""When They Gone"" (admittedly a classic. Most haven't heard it, but they should), and ""17 Reasons"". This CD shows how he went from wack musician to great musician and ruler of the rap world."
2,Could have been better,"It was ok, but not as good as his next few albums like Ice Cream Man. 99 Ways to Die had a few songs that dropped, but that's about it."
1,Garbage.....,"This is just another commercial gangsta Rap album. Its sad to see that people actually buy this garbage. Its time to move on and actually listen to artists who have something else to talk about besides 40oz brews, cash, ho's, pimps, and how many blunts they smoke.....peace"
3,99 WAYS TO DIE,"THIS WAS NOT A VERY GOOD LYRICAL CD, P IS NOT A VERY GOOD RAPPER OR BASKETBALL PLAYER , NO LIMIT IS PLAYED OUT BESIDES TWO OF THERE ARTISTS WHICH ARE SNOOP AND MYSTIKEL. HE WAS A FAD CASH MONEY HAS THEM BEAT HANDS DOWN"
5,Great CD! Hip-Hop classic by Master P!,"The CD is off the hook! The songs are tight! You can't get this from nowhere else unless you might be lucky to find it in some old record store! Dirty South to the fullest! With the West Coast connection! This is a back in my high school days! Now the reason why there is no Video on the CD because this was made in 1995 i think. Just in case folks wonder why there is no video to this CD! Then again, great CD! Thanks!Dee SmallsRepresenting:Decatur,GA"
3,Historic fictional story of early Montreal and New Orleans.,"Many historical novels of today seem to fall into a seemy romance, or an action packed documentary. The High Towers was written well before this trend. It uses a real sounding story to bring to the reader a plausable and enjoyable adventure.Costain is known for his Bible related novels and that purity of language and plot content translates to this novel.If you want to learn more about early Montreal and New Orleans in a clean historical novel, then this is what you are looking for."
3,Just okay,I really dont have anything positive or negative to say about this movie. Its just okay. There are others that we like better.
5,My 3 year old cannot get enough of this,"He is absolutely enjoying this. I bought this along with some of the leap frog series, and I must say, it is a very good investment."
2,"just ok, nothing more","I was really excited to receive these dvds in the mail, however i have to say that i was disappointed. The learning about letters dvd is particularly BORING! The 123 Count with me is ok, a bit too much talking to keep my 14 month old's attention. We own other sesame street dvds...the kids favorite song collection and he absolutely loves them. Unfortunately I would not recommend this to anyone!"
4,Great to teach letters and numbers,My son has watched this a couple of times already and has already started counting to 3. I love this more than the newer versions of Sesame Street. My son also loves it too. He absolutely adores Cookie Monster.
2,Mwa,My daughter loves to count but doesnt seem to like this video too much. Ernie is kinda annoying in it.
4,Nice for Learning,This is good for helping to learn letters and numbers. It's really nice that one DVD is letters and one is numbers.
2,"For the alphabet, Letter Factory is better","Unfortunately, my 2 sons didn't take to these 2 dvd's. For letters,LeapFrog: Letter Factoryis simply way better. There is no comparison.I like Sesame Street and wanted my kids to be able to watch some of the stuff that I grew up watching, but for at least my sons, Seasame Street isn't an option.For numbers, I haven't gotten any of the Leapfrog dvd's because the reviews are mixed on them. But I can say my kids did NOT like this Sesame Street #'s dvd either."
3,123 count with me/learning about letters,The DVD was ok...it seem to have been very redundant and does not keep the interest very long.
5,Timeless,"The children haven't opened them yet, since xmas isn't here yet, but the will love it! No doubt!"
3,Pretty good - but there is one thing I hate!,"These dvds are pretty good. Would have given 4 stars, but at the beginning there is a Sesame Street commercial asking for ""your support"" (aka money). That isn't the problem. The problem is that you CAN'T scan past it!! So every morning I have to sit through 30: of Whoopie Goldberg asking for $. It is annoying."
3,So Close...and yet...,One of the best and most underrated bands of the 80's. Why were they a one-hit wonder? Everyone I know remembers them and loved their music. This album is so close to being great... but their two best songs-- Blue Moon and Steamroller Blues are missing. Try and find an old copy of the original release.
5,I have spent years trying to track down this CD!,"Back in 1986 when I was younger, a kid from Wisconsin gave me a tape at summer camp - CD's were not the rage yet. The camp was architecture camp and I was geek. The tape was Out of Mind Out of Sight. Having only listened to Dean and Frank most of my life it was an eye opener. For a sound of what great 80's alternative music sounded like get a hold of this fantastically fresh and hard thumping CD. You will especially like Steam Roller. I am out of mind and Out of Sight gotta keep my body tight.Sincerely, Aud Ible"
4,Good information to build on,"Being the owner of Dickerson Landscaping, I needed to know more about the recent vegitable garden movement. This book has been a great source of information in an easy to understand formate of tried and true methodology. It is not just a front for a chemical company to push their products as the solution to everything. If fact it realy helps to explain why your garden may not be doing so well if you have been using alot of chemicals. If your seriousabout gardening this is a good book to read. it may have more information than your looking for, but it gives you step by step ways to get started, and be successful. If your in a hurry to plant a few seeds and instant veggies you might want to move on to an Ortho book."
2,Not worth the money,"Thought with the Eddie Bauer name this would be a better than average set. Within a week, one of the poles broke in half when our dog tripped on the supporting strings. The corks of both birdies flew out in mid play. Happy thus far with the ball and rackets but returning for a refund."
1,What a nightmare!!!!,"Two people with Master's degrees didn't have a prayer against these instructions. The pieces don't match the pictures in the instructions.The net was 15 feet larger than a regulation badminton court. What were we supposed to do, fold it in half?The scoring numbers were upside down. I kept telling my wife that an Eddie Bauer product wouldn't have mistakes. I kept insisting that WE were the ones making the mistake. After fighting over these instructions, I hope the marriage counseling is successful!!"
4,"Never got it from these guys, but finally go a refund","Amazon and their partner pointing fingers at eachother as to why - but I never got this bag.They did finally stop pointing fingers at each other and give me a refund, but it took a couple of weeks and should never have happened. I got fed up having one say they placed the order and the other saying they had no order - even though they had charged my credit card for it...I ended up ordering the bag through another vendor, got it within 4 days and I'm using it. It's durable, well made and does the job for me."
3,Its A $20 Gig Bag.....,"Its a $20 gig bag so it looks like it should for that kind of money. If you are only worried about marking up your guitar while going to and from your buddies house your good. If you are trying to keep it in good shape going back and forth to school, this is not the gig bag for you. I only need this so that my guitar is safe on car rides from Louisiana and Texas. There is no real support or extra padding at the bottom of the bag as some have, so if you set your guitar down hard on the end you can hear it reverberate through the whole thing when it bangs against the floor. It gives you one of those teeth gritting moments! :)Anyway, if you only need something to make it back and forth on a safe ride, this is the gig bag for you! If you are planning on hitting the road or take a lot of trips, invest in a more pricier bag!"
3,It's good enough,"It's okay. I got it for school. It's light weight but I don't feel like it would really protect the guitar but it's good enough. If you need a guitar bag, then it's a good one but I don't recommend it to professionals, or for really expensive guitars."
2,No protection at all,"Likes: Has a great front pocket for storing extra strings, picks, cords, tuners, etc.Has backpack type straps.Dislikes: Way too soft. Doesn't protect the guitar at all.There is no padding for protection. Guitar flops around so it is way out of tune when you take it out.You should definitely look into a hard case if you want to protect your investment."
5,Great bag!,"I purchased this bag as a gift after looking online at many different options. It is a good sturdy bag with padding all around for extra protection. And if for any reason you are unable to carry your guitar with your hands (on crutches, have other things to carry, etc.), the backpack straps come in very handy! It is pretty comfortable to wear and the guitar feels very light inside."
2,"Not too great, but best of the three","A few minor hits by I Start Counting are on this album. Not bad, considering I enjoyed half this album in contrast to Catalogue and Switch.If you want something quite different from Depeche Mode which you may be more familiar with, try this album.I Start Counting is unique in some ways, but the composition/vocals are too over-blended, overpowering, and may drive you crazy.You can't find their music in any retail stores to my knowledge, and it might be discontinued. Buyer beware."
5,Very handy quick reference,This little pamphlet is great for leaving by a window as a quick reference when you see a bird. The pictures are clear and the pamphlet includes a good representation of birds of each category. We also purchased a larger bird book for detailed information. The two complement each other nicely.
5,Great!,The toy was fantastic! I made two of them. It is very fun. You should try it. Hope you like it if you try it.
2,"It's not the toy, it's the loops!","The loops are of very poor quality. They fray easily, and this is especially frustrating when trying to finish the edges. If I can find a company which supplies better loops, then I can do this craft with my grandchildren. If I can't, then this loom kit was a waste of money."
4,Hook design is good,"I had a plastic loom that the loops kept coming off of. This metal one holds the loops better for sure and is certainly more sturdy for longer lasting life. I'm teaching 4 yr old twin grandkids to make potholders, so while they can attached the first set of loops i still have to do the weaving and casting off and for sure did not have the patience to deal with my old plastic one, so this one allows us to make potholders together, which the twins absolutely love."
4,Potholder Loom,"I'm pleased with this product, it's well made for its purpose, although I think the prongs of the loom may weaken with use over time."
5,Great gift for my niece! Well made and she loves it!,"Well made! My niece loves this! My sister-in-law was pleased because it is well-made and the potholders are made of cotton loops (not cheap, useless plastic).Thanks!"
1,Colors are horrible!!,"When you get this item you will get a bag of off-color cotton loops, no primary colors. I did not receive any real reds, yellows, blues, greens, oranges, violets, whites or blacks. 99% of what I got were ""muddy"" mixtures of real primary colors. I feel there is misrepresentation here about the colors of the loops."
1,Bad quality loops - fray easily,"As another reviewer said, it's not the loom, it's the loops that are bad quality. The loops are not stretchy and fray easily, making it hard for younger kids to use."
3,The Rowans Could Have Been As Big As Poco & The Eagles,"The Rowans are a talented bunch. Having plaid with David Grisman, Vasser Clements, and Bill Monroe Peter had his chops down.His brothers are no slouches either. The Rowans recently released self titled album recorded in 1974 is not imitation Eagles or Poco. It is a unique country rock sound. In fact Peter Rowan is or was a buddhist and the album adds some eastern instruments in the production flourishes. The album was not heavily promoted as Asylum records claimed not to hear a hit. It is a good album and a shame it was not heard by more people. It holds up pretty well in 2002 and was rereleased for this reason. It features Russ Kunkel on drums and Van Morrison bassist David Hayes."
5,A MUST!,An absolute time capsule for that period of time. Amazing performance footage of a variety of incredible artists.A must see!
3,"Decent film, cruddy dvd-r","Enjoyed the film, but the DVD-Rs that Warner Brothers is using are no longer playing very well in my main machine. So much for their initial claim for compatibilty with most players. (Have several that worked without problems early on, but recent ones do not.)"
1,Bad quality lancet,"If you want to buy this set for the lancet, don't bother. I thought it was the same as the other one made in Germany, but it's not. This one is made in Pakistan, the steel quality is very low, and the lancet blade is jagged (!). It's not even worth paying the extra money to return it since the original shipment fee you paid isn't reimbursed. This order was a total waste of money."
3,Doesn't really work (for me),"Please take this review into account only if you're purchasing this to try to extract milia. The product itself seems well made, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well for extracting the milia I have around my eyes. Everyone says the lancet is super-sharp, but in my opinion it could be sharper. The loop end didn't work at all on my milia."
4,Nice!,"I got this in three days the shipping was fast ...But once u get this item ..u have to un-screw it to use the stuff....but i love this.,...Would recommend"
1,Terrible garbage,"This product is not advertised properly. Its states that it is professional quality. its made in Pakistan. Mine has the hole drilled off center, its covered with a gritty grease or lube/dirt. The lancet has a jagged side with a sharp piece of unfinished steel hanging off of it. I cant see much of anyone using it better yet a professional. Ill see if I can find the time to do a video review so I can actully show what I am talking about. Spend another buck or two and get the tweezerman version."
2,maybe good but not for amateur,It must be used by profesional. Too danger use at home if you do not have practice for this
3,Not great for really small blackheads,"I do my own facials at home and I thought that this would be a good addition for myself and for others. I think that it works really great for larger blackheads. It doesn't for those really small ones that annoy you on you nose. It's worth a try, but don't expect miracles."
4,Good product,The lancet is very sharp and easily pierces skin when needed. The hole in the extractor tool is so small it is impossible to see through the hole to place it on the area for extraction. It does work well if one is lucky enough to get it to the right place.The lancet and extractor are safely stored inside the tool barrel. I find it easier to use the lancet without screwing it into the barrel.
4,"Works well, Lancet not very sharp","I was excited about this tool because I have a lot of blackheads on my nose that drive me crazy that I can't get rid of. This tool works well for getting small blackheads out, but when I used the lancet I had to push really hard just to get it to puncture the milia on my face. I was a little dissapointed in the sharpness, but besides that it does pretty well. I like how you can screw and unscrew, but sometimes they rattle when you use them thats a little annoying."
1,Useless too!,This too is a useless tool. It doesn't do the job as it claims to do on the products description.
2,Not sure,"This product did not work the way I thought it should. Either that or I'm just not using it properly. Either way, a waste of money."
2,not too impressed,"Blade is a bit crooked. This tool is hard to use. The tip is not sharp enough to help with much, and is a bit big."
3,The Book Was Alright,"The book had its good points and its bad points. The novel was very informative, however it was depressing. The book told of the true hatred the Nazi party had for the Jews. They were treated as less than animals, beaten, starved, and slaughtered. Unless they were able to work, they were left for dead. The novel, Night expresses the tragedy and real life horror that the Jews experienced."
3,A book for anyone.,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting how he told his story about what he went through. Even though it was about the past, it kept my attention. Reading books about history through someone who lived through it made it more interesting. I would of rather read this book then sat through a history class and not know what these people went through emotionally. I would of gave this book four stars but the ending disapointed me. I felt like there should of been more. The ending of the book should of been the climax. You finally figure out he survives but I wanted to know what happened after he looked in the mirror at himself. I recommend this book to anyone because all types of people I think would enjoy it."
3,Night,"I really liked reading this book. The book was written well. You were always interested in what was going on and wondering what was going to happen next. I didn't like reading in detail about the awfull things that were done to the Jews. However, the book wouldn't be the same without the details that were included.The book is very informative about all of the things the Germans did during the Holocaust. I think that it is important for people to be aware of of botht the good and bad things that happened in history. I can't really think of much that i would change about the book. However, I would have liked for the bool to have some pictures and maybe talk some about what happened when the Holocaust was over."
5,"A ""Night"" To Remember","I really enjoyed reading the book, Night. The book was interesting from beginning to end, and it kept me in suspense. The detail of the book was astounding. There wasn't much about the book that i didn't like about Night. The book was very well written so there is truly nothing I would change about it. Elie wrote this book so he could tell his of his experiences during the Holocaust and to straighten the mindset of those with false stories. The most memorable part of the book for me was when a boy had to push his living father into the furnace where bodies were cremated."
4,"It was ok, better than what I thought it would be.",Night was a good book to understand what someone went though during the Holocaust. It told facts that really happened. I think the people went though lots of pain.
2,A Search for More....,"I have read some preliminary reviews of this book, and I disagree with these reviews. I was not impressed with this book at all. I have read many many books on the subject of the Holocaust, including some by eyewitnesses and survivors, and I have to say that this is the first time I would not recommend a particular book on this subject. The narrator did not hold my attention at all, I found myself skipping pages, looking for more substance. I finished reading it, and frankly, I found it lacking in historic and personal meaning. Excellent authors on the subject of the Holocaust are Simon Wiesenthal and William Styron (Sophie's Choice)."
4,Nicole Bratlie,I thought this book was a very inspiring book. Elie though the whole thing all ways thought positive. His courage really surpised me. Because I don't think I would of been able to be that strong though that horrible experience he went though. Although it was very sad in parts I though it was a VERY GOOD BOOK! I think everyone should read it!
3,Night,"I thought the book was interesting, but they could have done without some of the parts. I thought it was neat how they ended the book. It didn't put to much closure to it, but it put some. I don't like how the book started though it was slow and at the same time boring, however I liked how they explained everything."
3,night,I think that this book was very boring. I think that it had to much gorry illistrations and that it was not approiate for my eyes. The book it's self was a ok book but it rambled on about nothing at times. thankyou
3,my review,"I didn't really like the book too much. One part of the book that I really liked was the way it was written. The way he (Ellie) told the story of his life. The only thing that could have been was the end, I think his dad should have lived or he should have saved him by getting him some water."
4,The boy and his father,"This book was interesting because it had a lot of action and told about what the boy and his father had to go through. It explains how the boy and his father stayed together through thick and thin. It talked about, how strength is what gets you through life."
4,A book of a 100 meanings,"I thought the book was pretty good corcerning all the death and despare. I thought that Elieand his father were going to die in the beggining. I think the Germans should have gave them more than bread, coffee, and soup. Overall the book was pretty good. In the end it all tirned out for Elie except for his father, mother and his siblings died."
5,Review of Night,"Night is a very interesting book. I like how it is a true story told through someone who was actually there and experienced the whole thing. I didn't like the graphic parts, but I feel they were necessary to get the point across. I wish he would have said more about his mother and sisters, because you never find out if he was ever reunited with them or if they didn't make it out. I think Elie wrote this book to prove to people that there really was a Holokaust and that it wasn't just something that was made up. My most memorable moment of the book was when the little boy was hanged. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to have to see that. You would get use to seeing the thousands of deaths, but watching one young child die slowly would just be too much."
3,Night Review,"I liked this book, because it was a true story of one's experience as a Jew during WWII, unlike the other silly books I have read in English during my high school career. Before I read the book I had high expectations, because of what I had heard; it was good, but it didn't meet the expectations I had. That's the only thing I didn't like about it. I wouldn't really change anything since it is a man's real life experiences. Elie's purpose for writing the book, is too inform others of what is was really like in concentration camps, etc. The most memorable part for me was just hearing of all the struggle's Elie made it through. Another memorable part was the part about the young boy that was hanged."
4,My Review On Night,"The book Night was a very good novel. It relly goes into detail about what the Jewish people had to go through during that time period.I would recommend this novel to people beause not only is it a interesting book you also learn about what these people went through to survive. Not only do you learn about their lifestyle , you learn about the pain these people were put through everyday."
3,Time to read,"This was an okay book, and is more interesting than some others,but it can still put a person to sleep. The nice thing about it is that you can learn more about the Holocaust. This is a good NON-FICTION book, but if it was a fiction book, I dont think it would have done very well!"
3,"literary critic book, alot of view points.","alright book, I'm looking for different views on the book for a lit crit paper."
5,Night,Night by Elie Wiesel is an excellent first hand account into the atrocities the Jew endured at the German prisoner and slave labor camps of World War II. This volume gives students additional connections into understanding the situations. Excellent version!!!
3,Night,"I believe that Night is an O.K. book. It is not a good book, and it is not a bad book. The reason why I think the book is bad is because it talks about killing, shooting, hitting, and burning. It is also bad when it talks about people who were burned, and how they stunk in so much detail. It seems like someone was obsessed. I probably wouldn't have lived through the Holocaust. The book Night is good in my opinion because it does not lie about any facts. It talks about how the Jews starved to death, and how they were burned. It also talks about how the babies were thrown up in the air and used for targets by the Germans. The Germans should be put in place of the Jews so that the Germans would figure out that the Jews have feelings just like every other human being. I would recommend this book to people who wonder about the history of the Jews."
3,Good book,"I liked the book. The book gave me a good idea of what happend during the haulacaoust.it also gave me a look into what the Jews were felling about there situation. I did not like all the irony in the book. It got very hard to follow. All the selectons got confusing. The part when the lady yelled about the fire. It told what was going to happen next. I did not like the gruesome facts. like when they threw the babes in the air and used them as mashine gun target practace. I liked most of the forshadowing in the book. Esppesily the part with motie beatle. Iliked the violence and grim truth about the tings the jews went thrue. Like the burning pits, and the hangings. I found it ironic that they turned right before they were going to go into the fire. In conclusion the book gave me a good overveiw of what happend during the halacaust."
5,A touching book,"""Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever...Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust."" (Elie Wiesel, 'Night')There have been more holocausts than one, yet 'the Holocaust' is still the name we use for one of the cruelest massacres of a people ever: the persecution of the Jews in Europe. The Holocaust has long since ended, but still the memories continue in the minds of survivors across the planet. This touching book tells the story of a man who was only a teen when he, and his family, are taken away. The tale is sad but true, and gives an excellent account of this man's life during the Holocaust. Though you know when you are reading it what the fate of millions were, it continues to be eerily intriguing. It is told in such a way that you can almost feel the pain, hear the cries..."
4,Detached account of a horrific event,"Night, by Eli Wiesel, is the story of a fifteen-year old Jew imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Wiesel wrote this book about fifteen years after the event in order to distance himself from it somewhat (obviously, the experience left too much of an impact to ever be forgotten.)Through his direct prose and straight language, Wiesel informs the reader of the horrors of the Holocaust. SS guards, barracks, showers, transportation, death marches, rations ... nothing escapes without Wiesel's observations. However, the book lacked description, perhaps because the experience was still too painful for Wiesel to recall-or perhaps because words do not exist to describe the trial.If only one book is read about the people behind the Holocaust, it should be Anne Frank's Diary. However, if one book is read about the Holocaust itself, Eli Wiesel's Night is compelling, shocking, and enlightening."
3,An Importatnt Story That Could Be Told Better,"Night is not a bad book. It is a good book, but it is not that good. The story or plot of the book is fine. It is a story that needs to be told, but I think it could be told better. Mr. Wiesel takes one idea from the beginning of the book and just uses that up through the entire book. You get his whole idea in the first 50+ pages. That makes the rest of his journey through the concentration camps less intristing and insightful, and it dilutes the power of the story. The problem with the book is that Elie Wiesel doesn't expand the ideas he laid out in the beginning. Yes, this is an important story. But it could be told a lot better."
2,My review of Night,"I read this book because, it was an english assignment and I thought that this book would be boring like all the rest. As I read this book I began to really enjoy this book. I was consumed by the story and there was something that you felt you could connect with. The actual events and that this book deals with is very diturbing and depressing. I believe that this book should be read by all so that mybe this horrible tragedy and terrible injustice agaist a group of people will never happen again. This book brings the evil out of the dark recesses of the human soul and into the light where it can be exposed and seen for what it really is. This book provides just a small glipse to what really happen to the Jews during the Holocaust and should read by all"
2,night,The book was not that good because of the bag langwig. the book had me confued all the time. That is way I read hunting book because of all they do is what I like to do in life. If you like the writer then you will like the book. In conclsing the book was not a book I would recaming to altheres.
2,Poorly writen with little detail,I thought this book was writen poorly. I felt that Elie Wiesel did not give us enough information on the Holocaust. I also thought that the plot was not well thought of. I do not recommend this book to read
1,I think Night is the most god-awful book i've ever read,"Night, while it is a great historical record, comes over to me as grusome, and sadistic as literature gets. This book was like a brain ulcer reading it, and i realy hated every minute of it. After all, if the haulicaust was such a horrible event, which it was, than why make yourself experience it first hand by reading the most realistic and stomach turning books written about that era. If it's WWII books you're reading, go look at The Diary Of Anne Frank. Do NOT read Night, as it will make you want to touch this book only with rubber gloves."
1,Not very good,"I thought that this book was very bad. Even though I felt for everyone that going through that, the awthor didn't really capture it well enough. It was terrible what happened and all, but this book just doesn't capture it well enough for me. - sorry"
5,Excellent factual account,This book is an excellent read for anyone with any interest in the concentration camps of WWI
3,A Night to Remember,"I thought that this novel was brilliantly explicit. Wiesel did not leave out any details from his experience. I loved the fact that this book was done from a child's persective. From cover to cover, it was disturbing throughout. It is very interesting to compare this novel to Roberto Benigni's movie, Life is Beautiful. The excruciating details were possibly too graphic for me. I would prefer a more subdued form of looking at such a serious topic as the Holocaust. Yet, I believe that Wiesel did an extraordinary job of telling it the way it is."
5,we are called to read so we don't repeat the past,"Night by Elie Wiesel is one of the best non-fiction books I've read. The author does not bore you with dates and useless information. He relates to the common reader and either doesn't use terms that the common reader wouldn't know or explains them in a simple manner. It is a story about his life but he doesn't put to much emotion into it, letting the reader have his or her own emotions towards it. It is the type of story that makes you sad but you have to keep reading it.He is a very graphic writer because he wants to make sure something like the holocaust never happens again. He uses images that are not meant to scare the reader, but to give him or her the reality of this horror. He took a ten year vow of silence before writing this book and when you read it, you actually feel like you were there. It is an excellent story and historically accurate for those wanting to learn more about the holocaust."
5,Heart wrenching and well written...,"As a tenth grader, I read many books whether it be for academic reasons or my own pleasure. NIGHT has made a substantial impact on me unlike any other book I have read. Elie Wiesel does a wondeful job of portraying actual events from an adults point of view while sustaining his childlike innocence. This book may also be enjoyable to readers who seek books with historical accuracy and depth. I recommend this book to any reader who is emotionally stable and mature enough to handle the graphic words of Elie Wiesel."
5,"hunger, hunger, hunger","Obviously, I agree with most of the things said by the other reviewers. What grabbed me, though, is this: the importance of hunger. How when you are starved enough, it really stops mattering how many people are being killed around you or even whether people are beating you up. Reading this reminded me that, even in the midst of all the terrorism and other terrible things that are going on in our world, material abundance (or at least a full stomach) is really nothing to sneeze at."
4,Great to read when you lose hope,When I read this book it made to think that how grateful each of us should be for all the blessings that we have.The world is such a better place to live after the end of those brutality and hopefully the world is never going to see those dark days again.
4,night,I enjoyed night. I thought the book described what elie wiesel went through very well. The descriptions of what was happening and where elie was helped me get a feel for what the holocaust was really like. I think a lot of teens should read this book. We should'nt forget the holocaust and how awful it was. This book really made me think about things like genocide and how we should try to stop it completely.
5,This book left me tired and heartbroken.,After I read this story I was astonished and disheartened at the horrid accounts of this young boy's life in a Nazi concentration camp. I am a 25 year old education student and learning about the history of the world has become very fascinating to me. It is unimaginable how the world must have felt after discovering what the German's had been concealing for so long. An entire race of people were being extinguished because of who they were. At times this book caused me to feel great grief and at other times I felt such anger. The retelling of Elie Wiesel's ordeal left me with an unforgettable image of human despair. It will remain with me forever.
2,"""Night""","I believe that this is was a good book for 9th graders to read. It is full of information about Warld War II. Elie Wisel explained in excelent detale about his experence during Nazi camps. The Nazi's put the Jews in gettos with eletric wire fences. The Jews appointed gonvernments and made life easy. The gastapo came in and told the Jews that thay ere going to put them to work in factories. Thay put them in cattle cars, and away thay went to gas chambers, and labor camps. Thay were forced to take all there clothers off, and run. The Nazi's called them cattle and swine. Thay made fun of them and laughed at them. Wemon and children were killed imeadetly. Men 18-40 lived in fear of not making the selection. Thay were alwawys being tested. Thay got numbers put on there arms. Prizon numbers. Thay got heardly any food, and would rather die. Lots of people comited suside. Life for Jews was Hell on earth."
2,Night,I did not like the book because of the bad language and the violence. I also did not like the book because they were always working. I didn't like the because of the beating the people for no reason at all.I also did not like the end because of the way they took his father. It was when they thought that he was dead but he was not dead. He was breathing. Then the boy took him and then that next day they can and got him out and killed him. In conclusion that I would not recommend this to people that done like violence.
2,Not all that and a bag of potato chips,"This book was alright, but i've read better. I think I would have liked the book more had I not heard many people say the book was so great. I thought it was boring at parts, and I couldn't really get into the story. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad book, but compared to what I've read in the last three and half years it was not all that great. It really seemed like a let down considering how many people said it was great."
2,A Poor Book,"Night was a book that I attempted to read quite a few times, but after one or two pages I realized that it was wiitten very poorly and it was very dull. I thought that there are many ways that the book could have been made better. The only good part was when Elie's dad died. He was sent to the crematory. And altough it was a sad moment, it added a little atmosphere to the book."
3,Rainette,"The book was ok, I like the way it was getting into the way things were back then. It made me think about how hard it would have been to live. I don't think I would have been able to do it. I would have had a different but that is about it. The ending was not as realistic as the the first part.I would change the end to make it more heartfelt. The purpose of publishing the book was to inform people how he way life was and the way people was being treated.My most memorable part of the whole book is how mean the people were and the feelings that people had for each other. There was no really big part that I liked liked but I can assure you that I will never forget this book and all the details."
1,The Night,"I did not like the book ""Night"" for example, I did not like it when Elie said ""that he could smell the burning of flesh and hair."" I would not recommend this to any of my frieds because they really do nto like to read about things that have killing of people in them like some people do. I do have lone friend that is would recommend this to because she liek to read about true storys and what has happend in our past history in amarica. The reason i did not like this book was because I am a hores freak. My friends say that I eat, dream, and sleep horses. Which in most cases is true. Most the time when i read a book it has to do somthing with horse or i just not intrested in reading the book. Most my friends say that I will grow out of this thing I have with horses but they told me that four years ago and i still love horses. I will always be a horse freak. Theses are some of the reason why i did not like the book ""Night."""
1,WThis is the worst book i have ever read!,This book was terrible and was horrific when it came to the description.
2,WOW! WHAT A CRAZY BOOK! @amozon .com,"I think this book was alright because it kept dragging on about crazy people saying fire hen there is no fire. If I didnt know this was a true stroy I would say it was fake. I highly recomend that you read it for you slef. Theonly part I liked about the book is when the german officer beat his dads head in. The sickest part about the story is when one of the german officers raped one of the jewish chicks. I have read some of the people rated this book and I think that they sucked up to my teacher, they said that it was an intense book all the time, not it was some of the time but not always."
1,Night,"I liked the book in some spots of the book. But in some of the other psots i didnt like it. I liked it when they were at the camps and the were talking about how the wroked. The things that i didn't like was when the were on the train, and at the first of the book. But i mostly thaought the book was retarted. Like when he meats the girl and then he meats her when they were out of the camps and they talk that part lost me. That was mostly when i didn't like the book. I wouldn't recamend this to any person that likes action or to a person, that likes to be interested in the story the hole time. For people that like to have sirval and naty\ure books, this is not the book. People that dont like violents this is not the book for you. Becuase the parts being shot and shoting babies in the air. Then when the people are being killed."
4,Night,"1. The book did a really nice job of explaining in detail how horrible the torture was for the Jews all throughout the Holocaust. I enjoyed how Elie did not hold anything back in his novel, and was very descriptive.2. I thought at some points he dragged out some ideas that he was trying to get at that never meant anything later on in the novel.3. I doubt I would want to change anything about the book.4. Elie published this book because at the time there were a lot of people who doubted the torture camps and concentration camps, and so he wrote it because he survived the horrible death camps and he wanted everyone to read about them and know the truth.5. The most memorable part was when they were leaving the ghetto and Elie's family was split apart. I can't imagine being split from my family, especially in a time of war and when I wouldn't know what was going to happen to any of us."
4,A spectacular read which feeds my fancy,This book shows the harsh realities of what happened to most of the people involved in the holocaust. From the creation of the first ghettos to the jews being liberated this book gives first hand knowledge and accounts about how the experiences really were. This book has impacted my views on the holocaust and I believe that if you want to learn more about the holocaust and get a first hand experience you should read this book.
5,Amazing,"I'm a 12 year old girl from Ny. I have read lots of books on the Holocast, but not one of them compares to Night. My brother who is 16 had to read it for school. He told me to read it and I'm glad I did. I cryed until there were no more tears. Please read this book, you won't regrett it"
4,Night,"After reading ""Hitler's Willing Executioners,"" I thought I had a feeling for what really happened with the Holocaust. But not until I read ""Night,"" did I really grasp the horror of the pain and suffering that human beings had to endure at the hands of the SS Nazis. It's simply unbelievable what the Nazis did to their fellow human beings. This experience of Elie Wiesel is something you will feel and experience yourself as you read it. Certain places will probably make you cry; it did me."
5,Night,"Night is the best novel I have read in a long time. It gives a play by play of the tragedy of the Holocaust. It begins with Germany taking over and ends with the most tragic loss, the one of a family member."
5,Amazing Book...,"I read this for an english class. The reason I selected it was because I thought that it would just be a breeze and easy to read. Once I got into the book, I didn't want to put it down. It's a very chilling, first hand account about the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp during World War II and it opens your eyes to just what kinds of horrible acts the Germans forced on the Jews.I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about the greusome horrors of the Holocaust..."
4,"Powerful, yet monotonus","While this was an excellent conveyor of the emotion felt by those who suffered in the Holocost, I found that it was slightly repetitive. Of course, I would expect some repetition for effect, but some of the trivial information was too often repeated. Still, a good book. If you liked Fragments of Isabella, then you should enjoy this one."
4,Night,"After reading the novel, Night, I would have to give it four stars. Five being the best. I really enjoyed the book, but it didn't have me interested from the beginning. The book started off pretty slow and I really didn't get into it until after the first chapter. Once the author started to really get into detail of his life in the concentration camps, and being separated from his family is when it really caught my attention. Not a lot of books keep my attention, but this one was different. Maybe it did because this was a true story. The author did such a good job explaining the horrible things he went through as a child. I couldn't imagine going through the things he went throught. It had to be really hard writing this story but he did such a good job and I reccommend this book to everybody."
4,NIGHT,"I liked this book because it kept me interested the whole time. It was very informative, it taught me facts about the haulocausts and about what had happened back then with the Jews. Before reading this book I didn't know anything about this, so this book helped me to understand and be aware of what had happened not so long ago, to the Jews. Also I liked this book because it had a lot of details which helped me to understand it a lot better. One thing that I didn't like about Night is that it had a lot of words that I was not able to pronunciate so I had to skip over them, and keep reading. But other than that I think this book was a pretty good."
3,Night Review,"Night ReviewThis book is entitled ""Night"". The author is Elie Wiesel. This novel is about the Jews and what they went through during the Holocaust. The main character is the author. It was sad.Although it was sad, it was very informative. It gave a lot of information about concetration camps. I can't give away the ending but it was a good book."
3,my opinion,"My opinion on this book is that it did not have enough drama invalved Eli could have put a littel more time in to what she was doing with the book and the drama that she used was not that good ,she could have put a littel more action into the caractters that she used. Eli could have used some pictures in the book to show the fear on the caracters faces and to show what the prisons looked like. The ather things I did not like about this book was that it did not catch my atention hardly at all and what I mean by that is that I couldent raely get into the story the way i was hopeing to."
4,preety good book,"After reading Night by Elie Wiesel, I thought the book was preety good. It taught me about what happened in the concentration camps and how bad life was back then. The book was graphic sometimes but showed the reader how bad it was. The book was interesting throughout and I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good interseting story to read."
5,"Wonderful, Marvelous, and Fantastic","One of the best books I have ever read. Night is an autobiography of Elie Wiesel, telling about his experiences in a concentration camp during WWII"
5,"Powerful, Tragic and Thought Provoking !",That man can stoop to such a level of cruelty is bothsickening and defies comprehension... Hitler and his Nazis werenothing short of pure evil. I'm not surprised that Elie Wiesel lost his faith in God. After reading this account of the holocaust I seriously wonder and ask how a loving God could allow such an atrocity to happen? The Holocaust was the systematic slaughter of innocent humans by the ' inhuman'. I commend Elie Wiesel for having the courage to relive his hell and write 'Night' in order that the rest of us may know the truth. He is an incredibly strong and brave man to have endured such extreme cruelty.
2,Night,I thought that this book was very uncalled for. For example the part where they were talking about the girl that did the nasty with the mean man. That was just inappropriate. It didn't make the book any better. The book itself was very informing to know what it was like during that time. Just some of the parts in there were things I myself didn't need to know about. This is just my opinion on this though!
3,"Night, alot of wondering","I read this book as an assignment in my Junior English Class. It is one of the smaller books on the holocaust, although it is not one of the better books. Smaller is not always better, and this book proved that.Elie Wiesel experienced a lot of heartache, grief, and pain through being in a concentration camp. He lost everything, his family, freedom, life, and faith. He was down and out and was only a 13-year-old kid. He tells about his pain all the way to his triumph and how he became who he is today.That being said, it was not one of the easiest books to read. I had a hard time concentrating and the book could not hold my attention. I was reading it, without understanding what the words really meant. So that being I never got the full concept of what the story was really about."
5,Absolutely Breath Taking!,"The Holocaust is a very touchy subject for ones to talk about, even if they are not a survivor. Elie Wiesel not only talks about his personal struggles while living in a concentration camp, he publishes it for the whole world to read! That is the definition of a hero. To change the world, he opens himself. I was disappointed in seeing that Night did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize until 1986. I guess that's American Society though. The entire book is of course very emotional and drifts you away into a world very few Americans know about."
4,A Touching Story,"The novel ""Night,"" by Elie Weisel is a story of hope and struggle for the survival of a Jewish boy against Germany's ""death camps."" Elie Weisel, a survivor of the holocaust retells his disturbing tale of the terror that was imposed upon the people of concentration camps. Weisel's srtuggle to survive would most definitely touch all people who read his truely devestating story. Weisel tells of the horror of the huge creamatories, where all people who failed the ""selection"" process that was imposed on all prisoners, were sent to be burned alive. He tells of the meager meals and unsanitary conditions that caused the death of millions of innocent people at the hands of the Nazis terror. The book is a touching story that most people will be affected by its form."
5,Night,"I thought night was a wonderful book. The best holocaust book I have ever read. It was not only a book about the holocaust, but if you look further it is in fact a book about humanity. And how when one's humanity it taken from them, hope is lost and you die. It is also about the bond between human's and how when one can rely on the other, they keep each other's humanity intact and are able to survive. This is such a powerful book! I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Night,"Night, a novel by Elie Wiesel, delves into the horror that Jewish people faced during World War II. Although not considered an autobiographical piece of literature, while reading Night, one can actually take an in-depth look at what the author actually went through during his time in the German concentration camps.This book took me on an emotional roller coaster that felt like it would never stop. From the first word I read, I didn't want to put it down. It contained grotesque detail that you can't find anywhere in history books, which up until now, was where I had found all the facts I knew about the concentration camps and the cold hard truth of what happened in them.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the abrupt way that it ended. All in all, even with its abrupt ending, this book was one of my favorites. I have never read a book that has made me feel so much in so litte time."
3,Night,"I thought that this book was a good book. Although, I thought that this book was like all the other Holocaust books. All the Holocaust stories tell the same thing, about the Jews being beaten and treated badly. Even though I think it was like all the others, I think this was the best one I have read. I would definitely recommend Night to anyone who is studing or just want to read something about the Holocaust."
4,In to the Night,The tradgic but true story of Elie Wiesel's experience in the Holocaust is one of the most enlightening stories ever written. I'm not sure if he could have been more honest but he certainly did relay his message. This story awakens you to how the world really is. It pulls the veil out from over your eyes and exposes you to the harsh reality that the world is cruel and can sometimes be unbarable. This story is a documentary on human behavior. It explains how we might react under certain conditions. And how propaganda can change how we might originally react. This book is something that i will remember always. I will carry this information with me from now on.
4,An excellent source of truth&#65533;,"This book was an eye-opener for me. Elie Wiesel had a way of making me feel like I was actually standing next to him while he was going through all of this. He talked about many of the situations with much depth, but not so much that it made me sick. He gave me enough information so I could still understand the troubles that the people of the camps had. It was nice to see how someone who witnessed this felt. After reading this book I want to learn more about the Holocaust and people's emotions towards it. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am positive that if you pick up this book, you will not want to put it down until the very last page."
5,*A Wonderful Book!*,"I thought that the book Night was a very good book. The author didn't give many grusome details, but instead talked about the emotional aspect of it. I have read a lot about the holocaust, but this book is one of the best that I have read. It goes into detail about exactly what happened while they were in the concentration camps. I actually felt like I knew Elie, and his family members, and I felt like I was there. I think that the things that happened to Elie, along with the others in the camps, was awful. The Germans treated them horribly, and I don't understand how anyone could torture innocent people. So overall I thought that the book Night was by far one of the best holocaust books ever!"
4,*A great book*,"I had to read this book for my English class and I enjoyed it very much. I have read many books on the Holocaust and this was by far one of the best. Most books want to include the horror on a physical level but this book took the horror on a moral level. Elie Wiesel did a great job explaining the emotional pain and also the mental abuse that went along with the Holocaust. This is not a long book and would be good for younger kids that are interested in the Holocaust to read. The book is easy, the content isn't very graphic, and there isn't a lot, if any profanity. Overall I thought this was a great book that did a great job at describing things that are so hard to comprehend about the Holocaust."
4,Expansion of knowlegde,"The author of this memoir had no problems teling us what really happened during the rein of the Germans. Many of the things that happened in this book were incredibly gruesome.I would have to recommend this book for a mature audience. there are crucial points in this book where you feel that if that were to happen to you, you would have reacted differently.To give an honest opinion on this book, if i didnt have to read it in class I probabaly wouldn't have picked it up.But once I opened it I couldn't close it. I had to find out what would happen. I had begun to feel if I put the book down before it was finished i would miss something.This book would be great to read if you want to get an eyewitness feel on what took place. Like most peope want to hear the how peoplw were treated and why they were treated this way. If thats not enough you might want to go to BlockBusters and pick up Schindlers List. This way you'll be able to see what happened and not just read it."
4,"The ""night"" sky contains 4 stars","The book Night, by Elie Wiesel is an extremely interesting read. This nonfiction story about Elie Wiesel's childhood is a life-struggling journey through many parts of Germany from the 1930's to the 1940's. This book will draw in the reader on the first page. The descriptions of the concentration camps are uncanny. It's almost as if the reader was really there right next to Wiesel fighting for his life alongside him. The great thing about this book is that it is a short read that can be accomplished within the vicinity of a few days.Elie Wiesel has many people in his story who, for the most part, keep him alive. He meets a young musician his age, and his father who ""saves his life"" on numerous occasions. By this it means that he will not let his son give up on hoping for life. This is a heart warming, yet a tragic, story of Nazi Germany and a young boys struggle. I would easily consider this book for anyone."
4,a review for night,"1. what did i like about the book? the thaing that i like most about this book was that it was a real story not fiction.2. what did you dislike about the book? i did not like how slow if was to get me interested in it.3. what would you change about the book? i would find a better atintion geter for the beging to grab peoples attition better.4. what is elie's purpose for publshing this book? to let people know what realy happend.5. what is your most memorable part? in the train with madom Shackner yelling fire, fire, i realy got the feeling thay ma have felt just from reading elie's words."
4,"I agree with Jeff, the book was alright","""Night"" was an enlighting story about the worlds worst time. There are many books about the holocaust, but this is by far the best of its kind. Its definetly a 5 star book, however, i only gave it 4 stars. I did not like the way the story was ended. I would have liked to know what went on after he got home, how many of his friends and family made it, and other follow up information. Other than that ""Night"" was an excellent book. i read it two times in about a month."
3,Alright Book,"The story Night was a very intersting book; I thought that it was a pretty good book about a boy named Elie who lived in the concentration camp. I liked this book because it is from a person who really had experience the pain of being a camp. There are things that I did not like; some personal reason of mine, when the SSR soliders took babys and used them as target practice. If I can change anything about the book I would add to the end what happen after I was free from the camps. I think Elie purpose for writing the book was to let people know what really happen in the camps and what really went on in some jews head at the time. ..."
3,Remembering....,"Night is a memoir, but the author was not a professional writer. That is why this could not receive five stars. The story was compelling enough, but I found it hard to get into it when the writing wasn't powerfull. It could have been better."
3,"Elie, the beast.",Elie Wiesel is a very lucky man. Although he has lost a great deal fron his ordeal he is fortunate just to have survived and been able to tell his story and win the nobel prize. This book is a real eye opener about the horrors of the Holocaust. Elie must have excellent memory to describe his life so vividly. I wonder if winning the award truly revived his faith or the million dollar prize money.
3,Not what I expected,"The book Night was reccommended to me by a friend who made it seem absolutely intriguing. I started into the book with the expectation that I'd be blown away, but at the end of the book I was slightly dissappointed.The book night is an account of the authors experiences during the Holocaust. I personally found the novel very shallow and not indepth. The characters were just touched upon briefly without enough background or knowledge of their true personalities or identities. For me a video shown in a History class would be the comparison to this book. It told the same tragic stories of Nazi Germany that are easily recognizable by many of us. If you're looking for a quick, easyread book that doesn't create much thought then this would be the book for you. But if you're like me and enjoy books with more of a plot then I reccommend you skip over this peice and move on to a more advanced novel."
3,This book was an ok book,"This book taught me how much kids and adults were going through in the time of the Holocaust. People really didn't have any freedom, they didn't really get to bring any of their belongings with them. Many people had died during that time, especially if they didn't do as they were supposed to. You had to be a certain age or you would be killed, so they, meaning Elie and his father had to lie about their age. The Nazies were really explained in this book. The author explained them as true as they were in life."
3,Night By Elie Wiesel,The Novel Night by Elie Wiesel is a good book. It was interesting as well as confusing. When you read it you have to pay close attention or else you will have no idea what is going on. It is a terrifying story of a Jewish boy and his father as they move from death camp to death camp. As Elizer and his father learn real hardships they also learn to love more and to be dependant.
3,My Thoughts on Night,Night is a descriptive book about Elie Wiesel's Experiences in the holocaust. A short book but very powerful as it burns images in your mind. It takes place in Elie's hometown of Sighet in Transylvania. He shows how his Jewish community of Sighet is heavily mistreated before they were deported from their homes. And the horrible experiences he receives on his way to Auschwitz. Elie also explains how this whole tragedy upon his religion questions his faith toward God and the other believers. He gives horrific descriptions of all the people he meets and the inhumane things they've done. This book is something you'll never forget with the impact it can have on you.
5,A touching story about a boy and his father,I read the book. I can see this in my mind. Such attrosities... It was horrible.. How the jews were killed so greatly. It was horrible. But the boy and his father (Elie) made a bond. That didnt break when he died. They lived through the camps and so fourth until Elies father could go no more. All they could do is pray and hope. It was a touching story... ALL SHOULD READ
4,Night,I thought that the book Night was a very good book in fact it was one of the best books I have ever read. I didn't know much about the Holocaust but after reading the book Night I learned a lot about it. I really like the parts in the book were he is about to give up and die but he says that he would live for his dad. So thats why I rated this book a 4.
4,night,"I liked the book, I thought that it showed very strong purpose. I thought that the book was good. At the beginning of the book it was hard to get into it,but when I started reading for a few 10 pages or so, I got into the book and it became easier to follow, and bloomed into a good book!"
3,A emotional look at the holocost,"Night goes over the same aspects of the Holocost we all have come to know after years of being retaught the information throughout grammar and high school. Perhaps it was the origonator of these cliches but I see it as being a little to ""standard"" and not very full of new information. One new thing that it does bring up and carries throughout, is the subject of god and what changes the Jews' faith goes through as they are exposed to the horrors of the holocost. I think this adds alot to a book full of gruesome discriptions and shocking first hand accounts, that only do that; shock you. Night is writen to appeal to you on an emotional level and gives a superficial overview of the holocost, while leaving much of the hum-drum and polotics of the holocost behind. Weisel's situation in the holocost was typical thus, if you can call it that, so was his story."
5,Tragic but Captivating!,"I'm a senior in high school and have just finished reading Night for our Historical Literature class. This has been the second time that I have read this book however, I feel that reading this book for a second time proved much more valuable. The first time that I read this was in 8th grade. It was the second time through that I was able to realize the capacity of evil and the destruction of lives that occurred during this tragic time in society. The Holocaust was an event in the world that caused great despair but the book allowed me, through Elie's thoughts, to step into his shoes and feel the roller coaster ride of emotions that were experienced. Night was a great book and I would reccommend it to anyone who would like a real life account of what it felt like to be living in a time of extreme hatred."
5,"Dark, gripping, fast paced.","A spartan, gripping account of Wiesel's personal horrifying experiences as a jewish teenage boy taken with his family by the Nazi's and suffering through the work camps. His only mantra becomes "" Stay with my father"".As a mother with two small children at home, I read this book in a day ( I am not sure what my kids were doing whilst I was so engrossed.) but this is simply an unforgettable, haunting book.I have given away my own personal copy of this book and rebought another...several times.If you are interested in personal accounts of the holocaust or tales of extraordinary survival against the odds, I cannot recommend NIGHT enough."
5,Night by Elie Wiesel,"I think Night is a very good book about the Holocaust. It shows what the Jewish went through like being separate from your family and being sent to concreation camps. The part I got really into the book was when the SS order the Jews to march on the frozen snow. I could actually see what was happening, walking on dead frozen bodies. they were starving to death and also freezing. that was sad and horrible to that to happen to anyone. this book gave more of a understanding of the Holocaust and the Death Marches."
4,Night,"I am a high school student in the 10th grade. I don't particularly like to read, but I was assigned the book, and with my average, I had no choice but to read it. At the very beginning, the reading was slow and dull, but as the book went on, it really grabbed my attention. The mental pictures that the author painted were hard to accept as events that some humans actually lived through such torturous times. Anyone who doesn't believe that The Holocaust actually happened, needs to read this book because there is no way that someone could just make all this stuff up. I thourgholy enjoyed this book, and I think that it should be added to the required reading curriculum of most, if not all, schools."
3,The Night,"THis was an editorial review about the book Night, by Elie Wiesel. It is about his own experience in Birkenau, Auschwitz that it's generally and not inaccurately read as an autobiography. The protagonist in the story is a piou teenager racked with guilt at having survived the genocidal that consumed his family. It said that there were no easy answers in this harrowing book. It marks the crucial first steps in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died."
4,Wow!!! A Crowd Pleaser,"I have just got done reading ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel. It was a very good book. I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't put it down. The book gives people a real description of how the Holocaust was, and how the Germans treated the Jews. It is a sad book. The Germans did so many mean things to the Jews. I felt that Elie Weisel did a great job on telling this story and what it was like when the Germans took over; put the Jews on trains, and at the concentration camps. If I was in his position, I don't know if I could let all those people know what happened to him. I would try and forget about it even though you couldn't forget about something like that. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Corey's Night review by Elie Wiesel,In the book Night I learned during that time that Jews had a bad life. In some of the parts I felt really bad for them. Like when some of the people got split up from their families. I could never do that. I would just choose to be killed. In the book people were treated worse than livestock. You could see teir ribs popping out and you could almost see every bone in their bodies. I could never live like that. One piece of bread for twelve people. And the Germans liked to watch it.
3,Night By Elie Wiesel,Night By Elie Wiesel is about Jews in concentration camps. Elie was one of these Jews. He had to deal with many hardships from the start to the end of the Holocaust. Elie had to help his dad survive. He also had to try and help himself stay alive. They had so little food. When they did get food they only had a small piece of bread. Many people fought to get more. Most of the Jews that were in the concentration camp died before they got freedom. Elie was one of the few to survive.
3,Night,The book Night by Elie Wiesel was an ok book. In this book there's a 15 year old boy named Elizer. Him and his family got taken from their home and had to go live in the ghettos.
3,Night by Elie Wiesel,"This book shows how life was hard for the jews and how the holocaust was hard too. Im glad that life is not like today.Im glad that i live in the united states, and not the forneigen countries. This book shows why you are glad your alive, and that we have food, they had to fight for there food."
5,Read this.,"I found this book one evening on the subway as I was going home.I was curious so I opened it up on the train and I couldn't put it down the rest of the night.As I read I was shocked;that I was actually reading a piece of non-fiction work,and at the amount of human suffering and depravity contained within its pages.It made me deeply upset and anguished during the read and afterward.Listen,this is not just some pointless story about suffering but rather a frightening look into how dark,evil,and sadistic man can be towards one another;and at what lengths man will go to survive,even under the most incredible duress.Also the heartbreaking circumstances of each.So I recommend you pick this up.I warn you,it is not an easy read emotionally but it could become an important read in your life."
4,The Holocost Night.,"Night is a horrific book about the holocost. The writer Elie is the main character and uses his own experiences to express his thoughts and feelings. He is a teenager who gets captured along with his father during the holocost and spends most of there time in auschuitz.The stories he tells are sometimes unimaginable, but catching, making you not want to put the book down.I don't want to give some of the stories away because that could ruin the book.I really enjoyed this book and recomend it to everyone. It is one of the first books I have read all the way through. It really grabbed my attention, and most books don't do that. I think that says something about this book. I think everyone should read this book to find out what happened during the holocost, and hear true stories from the man writing the book, Elie Wiesel."
3,Not horrible!,"The book Night, was diffently was not one of my favorite books to read. The book was very repetitive and was not a very exciting book to read. Night was an autobiography which is sometimes hard to write but this book could have done a little better on what they were trying to get across. Most of my classmates I believe feel the same way as I do. I gave this book 3 stars because it was very informative on what went on in the holocaust. I would recommend this book to people who want to know about the holocaust but not for an exciting piece of work."
3,Danielle's Review,"I thought that ""Night"" was a very educated and interesting look at what happened to the Jews during World War II. I think it showed how hard it was for families to survive during hard times. It could be a lesson for alot of families in todays world. I advise anyone to read this book at some point in their lives."
3,Night,"I thought the book was okay, the author talked about the camps, days, and what the Jews had to go through. He expressed a lot of detail in his book which I thought made it a lot more uderstandable. He said that the kids his age had to lie about thier age because if they didn't they would get toasted in the creamatory."
3,short book,"this is a really short book. it puts all the hard-core facts without giving too much explanations. it's straight forward, and i didn't like that. but all in all, it has meaning to it."
5,This is the best book ever made on this earth,Night was very combelling. On the the edge of your deck. it was kool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Second Time Around,"I recently read this book for my Historical Literature class and right of the bat remembered that I had read it before. The book is a elementary to middle school level, and that was about the time I initially read it. The second time around, I was able to grasp the ideas and content of the book I could not catch onto when I was younger. I am now a junior in high school, and have been educated of the holocaust for many years. Night raised my level of awareness for the struggles of the holocaust and helped me to gain an appreciatence for what our elders have endured. The relationship between the father and his son was a pure demonstration of the strength one needed to survive in a concentration camp. If it wasn't for the closeness they held onto, I believe both men would not have survived. I would recommend this book to people who want to be aware of the make-up of our history, told through the struggles of a father and a son's experiences."
4,Night was an excellent read!,This novel really went in depth about the holocaust and the prisoners of the concentration camps. It was a very intersting perspective from teh child's point of view. This book really opened my eyes to the pain and suffering that the holocaust slaves went through. I'm very glad that I read this book and I suggest that everyone who wants to read it should.
4,A good book,I think that this was a pretty good book. It told all the things that had happened while they were there. He used great detail and you could tell that he put a lot of feeling into this book.I now realize how lucky we are to have been born in a differnt time era then that. I feel so bad for everone who had to live through that. They must have been really strong people. This was a really sad book and it really makes you think.
5,Takes the Holocaust to a personal level,I could not put this book down. It took the general story that we all know about the Holocaust and made it extremely individual -- such a horrific yet gripping tale told from the point of view of a young person who was obviously changed by what he lived through. I'd call it a must read.
4,this book is great,i am an 8th grade student in a college level english course. most books we are required to read are terrible. this one was the only good one of the whole year
3,good book to read,"HI my name is Tony Hall from Madison, OHIO. And i read this book about two or three weeks ago. I personaly did not like this book because it didn't have enough action, the only time it had a little bit of action toward the beginning. But I would not recomend this book to any of my friends because they like action books too. I would recomend this book to someone whom might like books about life long stories. A book I would recomend is the diary of Anne Frank I thaught that was a good book and I could read that book over and over again. So I figured I would tell what I felt on the book night."
2,"The ""Night"" Review by me",i thought that this book was very grous and boring. i would not ever sugest this book to anyone. unless u like very bad things. the worst part was when they would take the babies and slam them against the wall then through them in a pile 2 kill them. and they would put 75 people in a cattle car for up to 4 days at a time. this book was discusting but it was full of facts. that is all.
2,night,I relly did not like this book but i had to read it. If you like learnig stuff you should read this book i learned a lot but it is about the jews durring the hollicost. It is baseed on a true story. you also might enjoy this book if you like sad stuff.
2,Summary for NIght,"Personally, i didn't like Night simply because it contained material that was too graphic for a reader such as I. Too many times the book told of people getting burnt to death, hung, shot, or beaten. That kind of stuff makes me think more of people dying then of the message the author was trying to get across to the readers.If the author had based the book more on the whole Holocaust event and not on his personal accounts, i think that i would have enjoyed reading the book more. I thought that the book wouldn't had been a personal story so i when i found out that it was a personal story i wasn't as interested in it. I do think that writing a story like that would take a lot of courage on the authors part but i just don't feel good about reading of babies and women getting killed over another person's prejuduce way of viewing the rest of the world."
2,Elie Wiesel - Night,"I think that this book was disgusting. It was well writin, but very graphic. It told the story the way it really was which was good in a way but bad in others."
2,Makes for an unsophisticated read,"Ellie Wiesel does not know how to write a book!!! He tries to make his novel dramatic by writing one line paragraphs and short, terse phrases. While reading the novel, Wiesel writing style makes him seem more like one who has researched the holocaust endlessly than an actual survivor of the horrific event. Actual first hand accounts of the holocaust by concentration camp survivors are few and far between. That is why I gave this book two stars rather than one. When Wiesel can buffer up his writing, I'm sure his novels will be great and remembered works of literature; for now, they are immature writings by an unknowledgable author."
2,Bethany's review,"""Where is God? Where is He?""That's one of the quotes from the book ""Night"". I thought the book was terrible, becuase the author (Elie Wiesel) went into way to much detail. He talked about babies getting thrown into the air and using them for shooting practice. They killed people for no reason. They threw people into a fire pit and let them die a slow aganising death. Can you imagine? I'd hate to have a slow, painful, and aganising death. That would stink!Anyway, these Germans came and took the Jews to a camp where they would, well, die. The Germans took them to the camp in a train and if the Jews were to jump off the train they would get shot.I just thought it was a really disturbing and sad book."
5,This book is very intereting-Phil,I recomend this book which is about Elie Wiesel during the holocaust. He had suffered so much and faced very hard decisions and I loved it. Everyone should give it a chance because it is a very good book.
4,The journal of Elie Wiesel,"Night is a good book if you want to learn more about the Holocaust. Everything in the book is true because the author, Elie Wiesel, experienced the Holocaust at the age of 15. Night is like a journal of the experience of Elie's time in the concentration camps. Elie's book really shows what it was like to be a Jewish person at the time of the Holocaust. He was faced with lots of problems and sometimes thought about commiting suicide. I greatly recommend this book for people that want to learn about the Holocaust."
4,Great Book!!,"This book is an Autobiography of a man who had many horrific experiences during the Holocaust. This man went through so many pains, including losing his whole family. This book will make you cry. I loved it; it was so well written and inspiring. It inspired me to NEVER give up at anything."
4,Srong Outlook on the Holocaust,This is definately one of the best books that portrays the horror and reality of the Holocaust. The brutal scenes are clearly drawn into your head with the descriptive explanations for what is really going on in WWII. Eli Weisel knows exactly how to get the point across in a way that has deeply touched many throughout the world. This book should be read by everyone to see how cruel people can really be. By letting this information out we can help avoid situations like this in the future. Anyone who can get ahold of this book should definately read it!
5,Simply Amazing,"This novel is one of the few books that is hard to put down. Its about the hardships of a fifteen year old boy during World War II. This book is a perfect example of what our world should not ever do again. No one should have to face what the Jewish people went through in the concentration camps. To think something so horrific would happen in the twentieth century! These are some of the realities we have to face, that such hate was in this world and still i today."
4,Night Review - IV,This book starts with a young Jewish boy being sent with his whole family to a concentration camp. Here his mother and sister were immediately killed. His only friend is his father. Anyone who is not strong enough to work in the concentration camp is sent to the crematory where they are thrown into a fire and burned to death.The child and his father live in the concentration camp for about a year. Then the Russian front gets too close and they are forced to go to another concentration camp. His father barely makes the journey and dies soon after because he is so weak from the trip. Then the child is suck in the concentration camp with no friends hoping the Russians will come and save him and the others.
5,Elie Wiesel's account of being a young man in a concentration camp,"This book arrived promptly and in great condition as promised. It is such a moving and brutal account of the atrocities that went on in Nazi camps, but it's a first hand account that everyone should read. These atrocities should never be forgotten, lest we repeat the past. It's a very well written book."
3,A study of human cruelty and human love.,"It takes a while to get into this book. I had to read it for grade 11 history. It's not that great, but you find yourself empathizing with the characters Lind and Judith. It's a little slow at the beginning, (okay, the first 150 pages, or so), but it picks up near the end. It reminds me of a soap opera, the way the characters have their secrets, and their lives are intertwined"
1,Even a classic on prairie life as a book is monotonous.,"This book may be a classic work, with realistic, down to earth believable characters, but the fact that it is based on monotonous life leads the book the be the same, boring and mostly pointless."
3,Nice ladder but the paint tray fell off,"This ladder is used at our corporate jet hangar. I bought it specifically for the paint tray that could be used to hold the fuel hose during aircraft fueling. This ladder is used almost daily, sometimes multiple times a day. Within a month or two the paint tray fell off. I put it back on and it fell off again. Eventually I just left it off. And so the paint tray, that doubles the price of the ladder, is laying against a storage shed. I could have purchased the same ladder, minus the stupid tray, for almost half the price. The ladder itself is sturdy and very tough, however. Just don't expect the paint tray to stay on long."
5,On Down The Road By Izzy Stradlin,"It starts with a hard hitting rock'n roll tune You Betcha. Sweet Caress is beautiful surprise, when it first started I thought ""What's This!"" It totally captured my attention on the first chord. Coke'n I love it. It's a catchy sing along with song. Izzy sings Got Some News so gently you can tell that whatever the news is its going to be baaad. Lot To Learn another totally rockin' song. It is a totally great mix of tunes. I love this whole cd but alas I am prejudiced. I love everything Izzy does."
5,IZ is THE BEST !!!!!!!,"...This is yet ANOTHER excellent cd from Mr.Isabelle.""On Down the Road"" is wonderful, and ""Coke'n"" is tremendous, but, as usual, he has created a cd that you can just stick on, and play all the way thru, without having to search for tracks that you like.IT'S ALL GOOD - just order it - it's worth it !!..."
2,not as good as previous efforts,"I give this album only two stars because it only has two good songs on it! They are ""Sweet Caress"" and ""Lot To Learn,"" all the other songs are pretty empty and without much feeling that Izzy Stradlin usually carries in his music. I was so disappointed in this album and I have been anticipating it's release for awhile. Hopefully Izzy will redeem himself on the next one. If you're getting into Izzy's work, check out 117 Degreees, River or Ride On, leave this one alone, it's no good!"
2,Spanish Numbers,"I was a bit disappointed when I selected this video. The advertisement at the beginning and/or ending of Sesame Street videos. They were dancing and it seemed very lively.That is not what you GET when you play the dvd. The colors are NOT as vibrant and some of the songs are quite boring. I love learning and only give this a two because it does seem that they are attempting to teach Spanish numbers and some greetings in Spanish, which is suitable. However, I did buy this video for the FUN that doesn't seem to exist very long in this dvd.Unless, your child is being taught Spanish, I say SKIP. FYI."
4,Very entertaining!,"My daughter was 15 months old when I got this and she loved the Fiesta DVD. It was very energetic and keeps her attentive. The songs are catchy not to mention she can learn some Spanish words. It's definitely great for babies that are energetic and likes happy songs. The ""Sing Along"" is more for an older Toddler. I'm hoping when she is older she'll like that one too. But for now she loves the Fiesta and she can watch it over and over again."
4,fun,"I bought this to use in teaching Spanish classes to primary grades, but the middle school kids love one song on it: ""Hace Calor."" The songs are ok (from an educational standpoint), but the story is a bit corny. It's fine though and many kids enjoy it."
1,Absolute dreck!,"No better than a badly written romance novel...I'd give this book a 'minus' rating if I could.A Silly, unbelievable story that is badly written.The religious overtones were like bludgeons to the skull.Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Disappointing,I have loved all of James Scott Bell's book until this one. I found the characters difficult to like. I thought the story drug on and found myself skimming large sections. I was also diappointed in that the Lord was just minimally in this book. This is not the quality work I have come to expect from James Scott Bell and I was very disappointed.
1,Breach of Promise by James Scott Bell,"After having read many books by James Scott Bell, and being extremely pleased with his mysteries, I was surprised to experience a complete ""downer"" in this book. All the way through the book, I felt uncomfortable. The book was told in the first person which made the main character's feelings even more depressing. The ending seemed contrived to bring to an end a horrible situation in only a few pages. I would not recommend this book to anyone as it left me feeling that life was ""ugly"" and hardly worth living."
1,Bait and Switch,"I thought I ordered Original Bazooka as it says on the picture of the gum bucket and the title of the product in Amazon...read way down on the page in the fine print and you get the assorted flavors. I did not see that fine print. I ordered the product and in my order again it listed Original Bazooka. The package arrived and it was assorted. When I contacted Amazon, the rep looked and pointed out the fine print down below. I threw the tub away as even the original does not taste like original because the fruity flavor takes over. I was so disappointed I have not ordered anything from Amazon since---both the vendor and Amazon could have been more clear about what I was purchasing. The picture and title should match the product."
2,Why?,"Bazooka had the best bubble gum ever. So, why mess with it? Don't know, but it's no where near as good as it was. The texture, size and flavor have ALL been altered, for the worse. I won't be buying it again. So disappointed"
1,Not what I expected!!,"This was NOT the bubble gum I remember from my childhood. The color was wrong, way too red and the taste was just WRONG. I was thoroughly disappointed.The claim is that it is the 'original' Bazooka; NOT!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible,"I chewed a lot of Bazooka bubblegum as a kid. This doesn't taste like it, or smell like it. Period!!!Not even in the ballpark, I'm Not happy!"
3,love this gum,I really love this gum I chew it about everyday. And I could not beat the price for how much I get. Also it was really fresh witch was really cool to. I will be ordering it here again. Thanks You.
3,kinda fun,The last cut on this CD is worth the price of admission. Elsewhere the virginal and lute playing is nice and the soprano sounds authentic. The notes are useful. Personally I like vocals a bit ` softer' then this countertenor although that is sometimes deemed less `historically correct'.
4,Drive and You Might Think Are Missing,"The Cars' have a lot of good songs, but my only problem with this CD is that it doesn't have ''Drive'' and ''You Might Think'' on it."
1,Doesn't even toast well!,"I bought this this toaster oven a few weeks ago and am very disappointed. It is impossible to even get a decent piece of toast out this thing. You put in one or two slices of bread (never mind six!) and the bread comes out untoasted in spots and nearly black in other spots. Just heating something up requires you to constantly turn the food to keep it from burning.Also, the door will not close completely. I'm buying another brand (because this one is useless!). I've learned my lesson, though, this time I will carefully read the reviews."
2,Not good,"I've had this toaster for awhile. I did not like that I had to turn three knobs to make a simple toast. As others have mentioned, you have to turn the timer to 10 mins to get the oven hot enough, but in 10 mins your toast will burn, so you have to stop it in 3-5 mins. So what happened to me? I waited and stopped it at 4 min and it was not good enough and turned it back to 10 mins. I went to see what my toddler was doing and sure enough the smoke alarm went off. I had a fire in my toaster and smoke everywhere!! It was a horrible experience. Granted that it was my fault for letting the toast go for 10 mins, but if it did its job as a real toaster, I would not have almost burned my kitchen down.Aesthetically, its nice looking and the crumb tray is the best thing about it. I am now in the market for a toaster oven, hoping to find one with a crumb/catch tray."
3,I agree it stinks,"I agree with the folks who wrote before and add one more complaint.I'm only giving it a ""1"" cuz you won't let me rate it ""0""!!!What brainless engineer decided to make the handle so big you can't see into the unit without bending down two feet AND what dumbo decided that opening the door should NOT shut the heating elements off????If it wasn't such a pain I'd send it back....now some poor SOB is gonna get it for a Christmas gift."
2,Disappointing,Not a great toaster. Really a semiautomatic. Needs attention to avoid burning the toast. Not a great oven either. I was surprised to find that the convection feature I have on another one was missing.
2,Roulette -- Toaster Oven Style,"If you like guessing how your toast comes out, get this toaster oven. It has two settings, ""raw"" and ""burnt"", and the setting seems to be completely random. That is, setting the timer to ""2"" could produce either result, both leading to less than pleasant toast.Also, the outside of the oven gets VERY hot. It's tempting to set things on top of the toaster -- DO NOT DO THIS. It's tempting to place things next to the toaster -- DO NOT DO THIS. It easily gets hot enough to start a fire if there is anything flammable against it. And you will burn yourself if you touch anywhere on the outside except the handles during or after cooking.On the upside, the broil function works very well."
1,Beautiful but pain in the neck toaster,"This toaster looks like a million bucks. But as far as utility, it is horrible. Yes you have to turn 3 knobs to make toast. And you have to estimate how long you think your toast will take - 1 minute, 10 minutes - etc. Just TOAST ALREADY! Then you wait... it takes a lifetime to heat up and then before you know it your toast is burned. I almost burned down our office building today trying to toast a tortilla that went from frozen to flames in about 3 minutes. NOT kidding."
4,Title portion 17 minutes long,"We have used other Vanderlaan studies in our small group and were excited to find this title. However the actual portion of the video for ""The True Christmas Story"" is only 17 minutes long. The rest of the total length advertised is made up of promotional material for other DVDs in the Faith Lesson Series. The series itself is excellent - challenging material that introduces the student to a whole new area of study. This DVD does not come with any kind of study guide. You will need to create one yourself."
1,Very disappointed,"I have seen many Ray Vander Laan videos and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them until this one. To me it was a 17 minute clip talking about King Herod and an advertisement for his other videos. I thought I was getting a 52 minute video of Ray walking and talking as he has done in his other DVD's doing a wonderful job of explaining biblical themes, but I was very disappointed. I will be asking for a refund."
2,Poorly written,"Definitely not the best book I've ever read. Not even mediocre. The plot started out okay, but then went in a completely different direction. The characters were not ""alive"", the description of the ""set"" was...okay...but what really bothered me was the plotline. It was as if the author didn't have a cohesive plan other than the very beginning and the very end, and then shoved in as many disjointed and confusing action scenes he possibly could. After reading it I immediately gave it away. Don't waste your money."
4,Fantastic!,It really made me want to know more about China and it was enthralling. I want to know more about this author who brought me back in time...
2,"BAD, BAD, BAD!","I had to read this book for school and it was so bad that I didn't read the whole thing. The day before the test I had to force myself to TRY to read the book. Luckily, I was spared and did not have to read thanks to my motion sickness on the bus.And anyways, even though our teacher said that he was a good rescearcher, he got some facts wrong. As said in another review, the Ox and Tiger come after one another. It's impossible that Chen was four years older. Also, it's kind of overrated how Hong has about 5 different father-figures."
2,River Pirates!!??,The plot twists were minimal and predictable. China was portrayed poorly and it was not believable. The book was totally unrealistic!! What was with the stupid river pirates?? I hated this book and only read it because I was forced to.
3,LOSES MOST OF THE MAGIC FROM THE ORIGINAL,"After many years of wishing to see this longer version of Cinema Paradiso, I couldn't have been more dissapointed. Whomever it was that edited this film in the first place knew exactly what he was doing as all of the ""new material"" does nothing but hurt the innocence of most of the main characters and ultimately eliminate it's unique magic. My guess is most fans will watch the new version once and return to the original afterwards."
4,Great movie.,"Tender tale about a kid, and the way the local Movie house influences him and people around him in post World War Two. Giuseppe Tornatore creates an atmosphere full of love and nostalgia that fully brings out the way cinema really touches our life. I love the priest who censors the movie a head of time with the sound of his bell when he finds something objectionable in a movie. Reminds me of the people we have in our government today."
5,MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!,"This movie will make you laugh,cry and look back at your own life. You will never forget this movie!!Probably one of the best movies ....ever.BRAVO!!!!BRAVO!!!!"
5,A touching and outstanding movie.,"I've seen this too many times to count. First time, in theater, was the shortened version, but I really like the full version. It's when Toto is reminded of his childhood. There are scenes bringing me to laughter, others to my tears. A great movie!"
1,Could not be viewed,The DVD was not available for use with our DVD player. It was foreign or for other countries usage. Very disappointed that it did not state this when I ordered it.Love the movie and wanted it but was concerned to re order.
4,Cinema Paradiso,"Another three-hour monster covering most of a man's life. Actually, the life of a special friendship between a projector operator in an old theater and a wonderfully naughty ten-year-old boy. It alternates between the amusing and the sad, as life will do, and you'll think about it after it's over.Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore has an excellent visual sense. He must, if I noticed it. Also, he has a very obvious love of old movies, and I wonder just how much of this is autobiographical. The truth doesn't matter. The ability to make me wonder is the point. Character-based stories do that. I've been preaching it to novelists for years."
3,Total Sleeper,"I watched both versions. The new, updated version is much better... still a sad story, but if you are into that.... you'll like this movie about personal loss and lost love."
1,Cinema Paradiso - The New Version,I got screwed and lied to - this was NOT the NEW VERSION or anything else it so claimed to be.
3,"the original is better, & the original isnt as good as we thought it was 20 years ago ...","a tad overpraised when it opened, the directors cut only serves to extend the flaws of this movie. the early scenes with the little boy are what everyone remembers, but it goes on & on & on & on after he grows up. not bad, but not great."
1,Really sad Christmas!,I ordered this movie for a friend of mine who was in the hospital with cancer over Christmas. She never recieved it. I was promised by Amazon that it would be delivered beforee Christmas but it never got there becasue the reseller or vendor that Amazon hired did not deliever it. Empty promises and no gift for my friend.
1,Cinema Paradiso,"The movie is fabulous, however the copy has defects - the DVD slows and stops in some places."
2,the director's cut was a great disappointment,"Most director's cuts of movies have novelty values. Some such as Blade Runner or the Extended Version of The Fellowship of the Ring not only enhance the experience but also made one wonder why the original versions were released at all. Sadly, the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso was a major disappointment. The addional footage in the first half, such as Toto losing his virginity were inconsequential, however the addition of a major sequence in the second half, when after the funeral, Toto met and rekindled his relationship with the now older Elena altered the trajectory of the movie and worst of all, diminished the emotionally charged ending.The original version of Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite films of all time. There is also little doubt that Tornatore is a wonderful film maker, however, in this case, the original editor(s) deserved praise."
3,cinama paradiso,"I bought this video because I expected it to be the original spoken in Italian with subtitles, but it wasn't. It was dubbed in English.It sounded awful and we are very disappointed.If your site described exactly what it was, we wouldn't have made this purchase"
1,"My fault, but still frustrated","In searching for this title, almost all of them were sub-titled in English. I selected, purchased, only to find out that is was all in Italian. So, it's basically useless for me. Ended up renting it from a video store."
1,Weak,"This could have been a heartening, romantic-but-realistic memoir conveying the magic of small town life in the 1940s, growing up, etc. Some of this was achieved. But something rotten in Italian culture insists that men are just boys and must always be forgiven and humoured for their dirty jokes, their ogling, their public masturbation, and their use of prostitutes. The women in this film are largely passive, or at least without function. I switched it off about 2/3 of the way through. It was conveying nothing one might wish the human race to live up to. Despite its popularity and the critical acclaim, I think it's just another easy-sell reassurance that nobody needs to grow up. The worst thing a movie can do is to demand little of the viewer, and Cinema Paradiso demands nothing at all."
4,Skip the 2002 version,"Sometimes, directors should leave well enough alone.Cinema Paradiso in its original version is a lovely, funny movie about a boy growing up. It is one of those movies that can be seen again and again.The director's cut is a mess that clutters up the original story with a totally unnecessary subplot, turns one hero in the movie (Alfredo) into a monster and the other hero (Salvatore) into a stalker. The editing is such a botch that end of the movie becomes meaningless. Had this version been released in 1988, the movie never would have won the Best Foreign Film award.This new version is a textbook case of why directors should not recut their films."
5,Wonderful,"A story about falling in love and meeting people who change our lives forever. It tells the story of growing up and moving away from home, while never forgetting our past and where we are from. The main character (Salvatore) returns to his hometown after 30 years of being away and discovers that he was never really gone. His feelings are unchanged about the people he had affection for while growing up - mainly his first love Elena and Alfredo, the projectionist and his father figure. During his visit, he learns he must let go of some longings and desires that can never be fulfilled. The ending I will not soon forget. I was amazed and felt this is more than just a movie, it is hard to describe in words."
5,"Sweet, touching film","This is one of my favorite movies, it's sweet, sentimental, comical and sad all at the same time. Listening to the language is like listening to someone sing, and the words are just beautiful. I enjoyed it so much when I rented it from the video store, I bought it the next day. It's a good date movie, a good girly movie, and just an all around feel good movie about life, love and happiness."
3,Liked the old version better,This is the No. 1 movie on my all-time favorite list. I finally saw the Director's original version and I know why the scenes it includes were omitted in the U.S. release. The acting (particularly the scene in the car when Salvadore and Elena meet as adults) is down-right clumbsy. The added army scenes added a touch of humor and admittedly explained Salvadore's absence for such a long period but I rather liked the unrequitedness of the shorter version. It left one with a haunted feeling for the main character.
2,"This DVD is formated for Europe, not the U.S>","Beware! This dvd is formated for Europe and will not play on most dvd's in the U.S., but it can be played on a laptop or desktop computer. There is a ""free"" program on the internet to reformat it but I did not feel that skilled. I had it reformated by a professional who made a pricing mistake and it cost me $20; otherwise it would have cost $40 to reformat. ..I was determined to have a copy I could play on my dvd. The film is a classic...a real work of art!"
1,Not the Extended Version !!,There are 2 DVDs in this set and one says Original and the other Director's Cut. But they are EXACTLY the SAME MOVIE !!There was no quality control on this item and now I have to send it back . If you order this you RISK getting ripped off.
5,FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"This movie, a warm and sentimental delight, delivers it viewers many gifts, most of which come as subtle surprises. It features wonderful performances, a spine-tingling soundtrack and a testimony to the power of the movies unlike any MOVIE ever made. Please please please do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch the dubbed version -- it depletes the wondrous acting by eliminating their own voices -- also: stay with the movie through its closing credits. The final shots deliver what might be the sweetest surprise of all. Happy crying!"
1,"5 stars for original version, 1 star for new version","I must add my voice to others who were disappointed by the ""Director's Cut"". Having been so impressed by Tornatore's film the first time, I trusted that he would make it even better. This is not the case. Our favorite little boy, when grown up, is still obsessed with his first love, but so much so that one wishes to slap some sense into him. While trying not to give too much away, watching this middle-aged, grey haired man struggle with purely adolescent issues is nothing short of pathetic. In the case of this movie, less is indeed more. Still buy the DVD if you want -- the original version is there, too, on the flip side. With the original version, you have sweet sentiment and artistic subtlety. With the new version, you have over-the-top sentiment and a tiring soap opera."
5,ENDLESSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"He's waiting for love. Love's waiting for her. She's waiting for ...Endlessly waiting, endlessly movie."
4,Heartwarming...,"Last year, a good friend of mine, her boyfriend, and her best friend were in a terrible car crash. My friend along with her friend were killed and her boyfriend was seriously injured. Since both my friend and her boyfriend were in my film class, my professor showed this film.At the time, I was impressed with it, the pain of what happened was all too real... but looking back, she made a good choice in showing the film. It showed me a little bit about dealing with loss as well as fulfilling your dreams... It's a wonderful movie about life, love, and passion... check it out for yourself!"
5,A true testimony to the beauty in Italian culture!,"We have all loved the cinema and Cinema Paradiso exemplifies the true love and joy that movies bring to people's lives. This is a touching movie about culture, community, dreams, and relationships. If we could all dream like Toto and love like Alfredo, then we would understand the opportunities that await us.One learns that we are all tied to our pasts, our roots. Those relationships make us who we are today and they never leave our hearts. This beautifully cast, directed, and shot movie reminds us that there can and should be a time when we can all return home and find the person who we once were, full of enthusiasm, joy, and wonder."
2,An extended fiasco!!!,"As one of the reviers said, i was completely enticed by this movie when i first saw it. Then, when i bought this DVD, it seemed to me as if i was watching a different, stupid movie. And then i realised that it was the famous ""extended version."" One of the things that i loved about Cinema Paradiso (the original version) was the ending; it was unexpected. The end of the extended version was adapted to Hollywood standards, which in my opinion, are completely predictable, and thereby for dummies. Please, this version is completely insulting!!! By all means, by the original version! I urge you!"
5,Astonishing,"There are few people who will know the depths of the loves portrayed in this movie: the complete, early love of an art; the selfless, stern love of a mentor; the young--in some ways unfilled, incomplete--love of an impassioned couple.Perhaps the film's greatest gift--aside from the wonderful story you will see; the strong emotions which you will feel (tears will drop)--is that you will be shown, almost tangibily, these depths so you may, in your remaining life, attempt to fathom them yourself."
5,"This is a ""MUST SEE""!","I so thorougly enjoyed this film. The acting, story line, cinematography were all excellent.It showed the sadness and joy of life that sometiems occur at the same time. It is told through the eyes of a small boy living in a bombed out European town during the end of WW II. The child actor is perfect. I love movies; and this film is about a young boy, who also loves moveis. The film demonstrates how movies can makes us laugh, cry and perhaps distract us from our presnt sorrows. Great story, great film, I highly recommend it."
5,Past Imperfection,"I rented a copy of ""Cinema Paradiso"" because it was a Foreign-Language Oscar winner and that, to me, is usually recommendation enough. The movie begins in the present with news of a death. Like ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and ""Citizen Kane"", ""Cinema Paradiso"" gives us the story behind the man we don't yet know. In the process there are many heart-warming (and heart-breaking) scenes that give us a glimpse of how a young boy's life is affected by so many different elements. I was struck by how all the characters have flaws of their own. This isn't ""The Wizard of Oz"" where all that is corrected in the end. We come away from ""Cinema Paradiso"" with some degree of disappointment yet very glad that we took the time to give our emotions a good workout.During the closing cast and credits, my teenage son came into the room and asked what kind of foreigh film was I watching now. I said, ""This film is why I watch movies"". I'll leave it at that."
3,Cinema Paradiso,"I was hoping this was in Italian with English subtitles, but it was doubed in English. Otherwise it is a great story."
2,Problem with Buffering,"I enjoyed this movie, however, the quality was only OK and the streaming kept getting interrupted. Several times, the film would stop the note ""Buffering"" would appear. I had to go over and restart to get it to work. Very frustrating trying to watch a movie that way!!!"
5,"Has it all-love, happiness, sadness, laughter & tears.","What a great film. A film that takes you from tears to laughter, from frowns to smiles and from the stress of being an adult to the carefree days of our youth. A must see movie. You won't be disappointed. Bravo!!!P.S. View the subtitled version only!"
3,"Please, please, ignore the new version!","I am among those who succumbed to curiosity and watched the new, extended cut. And I fervently wish I could erase it from memory. Nary a frame of it adds to the original story; in fact, it brazenly and systematically dilutes and sullies all the magic of the original. It trots out worn cliches about recapturing childhood and second chances, and makes out Alfredo to be a bitter back-stabber. Watching older Toto stalk Elena was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. DAMN! HOW can I recapture the original's beauty?There's good reason many of us are championing the original. There's good reason the original was released the way it was. Don't feebly tell me about needing 'closure' or 'more-is-better' garbage. Stay with the original, and use your imagination. Trust me.5 stars for the original, a generous 2 for the new cut, = 3 stars."
1,Cinema Paradisio,"I am very disappointed because there are completely missing segments throughout the film and the ending when the principal character meets his former love is missing. In addition, I was not aware your were sending me a copy of ""dubbed in English"" which is terrible. I expected English sub titles which is the only way I have viewed this film."
1,......,who would want to get poop stains on their ipod? this just turns your ipod into a germ transporter.
4,Affordable Bag!,"Hasn't fallen apart on me yet! Going over a little 2 years now. Decent amount of space for other nick nacks such as your capos, wires, picks, etc. It's simple and practical.There is a plastic logo sown on the front. It doesn't show on the picture supplied and really doesn't effect that look that much. But I don't like that they hid it. :) 4 Stars!"
1,your Axe deserves better,"If your guitar is under $100, then this bag will work.You NEED a case for any decent guitar. Don't mess around."
1,On Top of Spaghetti,"The tiny postcard-size paperback was not at all the same book as I ordered. I had choosen On Top of Spaghetti by Paul Brett Johnson. The book by Johnson is a fantastic book. The paperback version seemed to have a different cover, but when I clicked on it, the pages looked the same as the one by Johnson. When it came in the mail it was a completely differnt book inside. I feel ripped off and am very unhappy with what I got. I would give it zero stars; however, I don't think that is allowed."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"We initially checked this book out from the library after acquiring an appreciation for the author from the Little Bunny Foo Foo book. Like Little Bunny Foo Foo, we ended up checking the book out several times so I decided to buy it. This is a great extension of the song that we've all sung at some point and a great adventure for the meatball! Every child should have this book!! Parent and children will love it!"
4,Shakespeare as a social energy,"Writing today a book that still has something to say about Shakespeare is hard on our days. This is the reason why one can consider this book outstanding. Nonetheless, I have read many recent books about Shakespeare and I consider that behind the interesting concept of social energy lies an excessively skeptic version of Shakespeare. I can agree that Shakespeare's preeminence in the canon is largely due to the circulation of social energy, but I think that many of the richness of Shakespeare is too reduced to this factor. The book is an excellent reading for anybody interested in Shakespeare but requires some balancing. My recommendations would be the heterodox book by Rene Girard and the passionate and excessive approach of Bloom. This triad gives an excellent approach to contemporary theses on Shakespeare with complete counterarguments that neutralize the radical points of view of the three authors."
5,GO RAMMSTEIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The best music I have heard in a long time. Strong, very strong, a lot better lyrics than in Herzeleid. Go get it"
5,TILL HAS A SEXY VOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sehnsucht is awesome! Its the best CD ive ever listened to!! Rammstein kicks ass, and Tills voice sends shivers down my spine! Buy this CD, and by the way, for all you party poopers out there, Rammstein is NOT, I repeat, is NOT neo-nazi or racist in any way!"
5,The Grammy Nomination says it all!,"I'm excited that Rammstein is nominated for a grammy...well deserved. It is amazing to see the same people who made fun of me a year ago for liking Rammstein are the same people buying the cd today. In today's all to often bland music scene, Rammstein gives an edge that we have been dying for!"
5,"More melodic than Herzeleid, brought Rammstein to the world.","This album is more melodic than its predecessor, Herzeleid, yet makes you want to stomp all over and smash things. Very energetic, full of the sterile, abstract, darkly surreal spirit of German electronic music."
1,"Sennsucht, all right","These guys sound like an updated edition of ""Dos Dedos Mis Amigos""-era Pop Will Eat Itself. That said, why are these guys called ""metal?"""
1,THIS CD IS TERRIBLE!!!,"plain and simple: this cd sucks. If you even speak a lick of german you'll understand the idiocy and mediocrity of the lyrics in these terrible songs. In Songs such as sehnsucht, betrafe mich, and the terrible ""buck dich"" (which literally means ""bend over"") there's the added element of electronica techno that's just simply hilarious to listen to in these harder-edged intentioned songs. This cd's a joke lyrically and musically. If you want me to give you a taste of how stupid these songs are, i will translate the first verse to buck dich: ""Bend over, i order to you, turn the sundial away from me, your face is indifferent to me, bend over"". Now anybody who says there's complexity to that song is a bumbling moron. This cd is crap and don't waste your money on this superficial wannabe hardcore image-driven german travesty."
3,Well.. Just look,Let me start buy saying yes i am a fan but i dont why the hype is huge everyone is in love with them but why unless you speak German you really dont understand what their saying but dont get me wrong they have great tunes to all their music this Cd i thought would be better if it had no words that music is just mosh music not really listening music if you get what im saying so leaving you with a 3 star rating i wish they would sing english
1,"A poor, overrated conglomerate.","This album is simple trite, nonsense.Go to the little ""Search"" box on the side of your screen and type in Einsturzende Neubauten. If your wondering how Rammstein came up with their stage show...there's your answer kiddies. Did anyone else notice the stricking similarity between Ministry's ""Just one Fix"" and ""Du hast""?..no it couldn't be"
1,Come on!!,Who would want an German cd. I wouldn't! Du Hast is at the edge of being ok! It is almost a bad song. But I do like the gutair sounds in Du Hast. Gotta be crazy to buy it!
3,Are you sure that you understand what they say ??,"I am German and I don't like Rammstein's music that much, it's not my kind of music - but what is rather weird is that nobody seems to notice that the English translation for the song ""Du hast"" is completely wrong !! ""Du hast""(SINGLE S) means ""You have"" and not ""You hate"". The translation is ""You have, you have, you have asked me and I didn't say anything.."" ""Du hasst"" (DOUBLE S) would be ""You hate""."
3,Hmm.....,"I'm not that a big fan of Rammstein, but a couple of songs ain't bad. I think if more people knew what Rammstein are singing about, less people would buy this CD. But I have to admit, their performances really rock:)"
3,Its ok.,"I thought this piece of work was so-so. definitly something my brother would like but not me. Yes, the guitar chords are very good but not something I would want to wake up to. And the lyrics are terrible."
4,&#65533;ber Sehnsucht,"I am a big Rammstein fan. Although I think Rosenrot is better, this is still a great album. If you like Rammstein check out Oomph!, they are another German band that is simmilar. Also about the Du hast issue, it is ""you have"" or a more accurate translation is ""you've"". If it were ""you hate"" then the line would not make sense as you hate me asked and I did not say anything. Also ""hate"" is pronounced with a long ""a"" where as ""have"" is pronounced with a short ""a"" sound."
4,What an incredibly original and refreshingly wild sound!,"While Herzeleid is probably the better album, Sehnsucht is the CD that started the craze here in America. Besides that, it posseses one of my favorite songs ever, Du Hast. It seems to get better each time. So much music gets old fast, but Rammstein, along with Metallica, White Zombie, even Led Zepplin, and a few other hard rock and metal bands stay with you and remain incredible listening experiences. This album is a great example. Can't wait for that new CD!"
4,Rockin techno mix,If you like techno this is the CD to get.....MAD techno beats.... with the most known song Du Hast This is one you dont want to miss......
4,Awesomely gothic,"This is a terrific album...it's so extremely gothic it's almost funny in places, but the guitars ROCK. Next time you want to be whipped through your exercise workout, put this in your Walkman."
5,Rammstein!,"I think we all know Rammstein epic ""Du Hast"". But that isn't their only good one. This CD is full of great songs and spectacular riffs. Without Rammstein, industial metal would not be anywere or may not ever exist.Yes, you should buy this album and some other Rammstein classics."
3,My least favorite......but that doesn't mean it sucks!,"I own all of their cds(excluding live) and have come to the conclusion that this is their weakest offering. Not to say it is worthless.....there are many awesome tracks through out the cd. But the overall batch of songs that were written,then chosen are just not as great. I don't know what happenend to them after their debut. Sehnsucht feels and sounds like a watered down version Herzeleid. The songs just don't seem to have the bite that they should have. The production is very thin for some reason and the vocal stylings seemed to have taken a step backwards.I certainly do recommend this along with their other albums..............but there is no rush to get this one.............save it for last."
2,Done better everywhere else,"This album, and Rammstein in general, try many different concepts which would be a good thing except you'll find each concept done better everywhere else. If you want some hard rocking industrial then check out another band originally from Germany known as KMFDM. If you want the intensity then go buy an album from Slayer (can you handle that?) and if you want REAL industrial then get a cd from Front Line Assembly. Anyway you look at it, Rammstein just dosn't cut it"
4,I liked it,"Du Hasst is a really awsome song, thats what got me hooked. I don't have the cd and don't know wha the other songs are, but Du Hasst is a catchy song."
2,Neubauten for the Taste Impaired,"I'm not going to be as harsh as my friend from Dresden, Deutchland, but I'm not going to praise Rammstein either. The songs are catchy but lack the sophistication of Einsturzende Neubauten. I would normally be all for any group that can make it big in the US singing in a foreign language, but the average fan of this band probably isn't listening for the lyrical content. They probably just listen to it because it rocks. That's ok, but unfortunately that attitude is the reason so much mediochre music hits big while bands that are so much better will forever languish in the underground. But that's ok. That's the way we'd want it anyway."
3,I Know German!,"Ok, so, I have an Austrian Grandmother and a Hungarian Grandfather. They both speak german.Du Hast DOES NOT mean You Hate, it means You HaveGefragt means ASKEDGesagt means SAIDNein means No, there's a different word for ""Never""Anyone who doesn't believe me go buy a German to English dictionary."
4,"Rammstein, bitte...","Mein entertainment. Rammstein is a GOOD band. My fav songs R Sehnsuct, Bestrafe Mich, Du Hast, Klavier, Alter Mann & Eifersuct. They certainly Rn't Gott's Engels in Himmel playing harps... but if it wasn't fierce, it wouldn't B Rammstein. I think Rammstein's fannin' the coals o' Industry & startin' a real riot 2 spark flames, eh...?"
5,Ich finde die musik sehr prima!!,this is the best german music i've ever heard since i've lived there. You got to buy if you don't then..Du bist varm!
1,NECROPHAGIST crushes rammstein with Technical Mastery,"NECROPHAGIST is the only Real Metal Band from Germany that matters, they are a million times better than that Power Metal Junk and Electronica based mainstream Rammstein.Want proof?, listen to their album ""Epitaph"" and die!"
1,And that's even too much,"I hate every minute of it. Incredibly stupid lyrics, synthesizer tunes which lack even the creativity of a band like Modern Talking (another German quality product) and riffs Kirk Hammett could play. But buy it anyway, get a good laugh and then use it as a frisbee. ..... They should be ashamed to even use this beautiful language. Sing in Swahili for all I care, but please, stop making this ...(stuff)."
5,Unquie band,Rammstein has to be a unquie band for what they do. They dont sing in american when they sing which makes them so unquie. All there albums are very good but this one would have to be the best.
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Not really the album I expected from a highly publicized group of ""firebreathers"".Couple of unlisted tracks show some promise.None of the other tracks besides Du Hast really ropes you in, at all.Try before you buy."
5,RAMMSTEIN has it ALL....,"Industrial Metal's finest has to be Rammstein. P-O-W-E-R-F-U-L. Amazing lyrics, haunting vocals, furious guitars and drums all fuse together to create a legendary album.This album gets your adrenaline flowing and your heart pumping like no other. Hard, Fast, Brilliant. Few can kick it like Rammstein. The sound appeals to many people, not just hardcore industrial fans.Unmatched. Rammstein has no equal- anywhere."
5,The guitar riffs are totally awesome!,"The sounds are totally in-your-face. The entire sound keeps you on the edge of your seat. The guitars come across the most, but the complete sound is fantastic!"
5,Awesome album!,"I had this CD a long time ago and lost it at some point. Finally ordered another one and the price was super and it shipped pretty quick. Perfect condition, no cracks, scratches or skips."
5,Classic Rammstein,"Rammstein has long been my favorite band, and this album is a must have if you're a Rammstein fan. The choppy hard guitars are very unique in this album. Every song on this album is a heavy song that you come to expect from this band.The first thing you notice is the album artwork, featuring the members of the band looking like something out of a horror flick but humorous at the same time, and the back of the album showing a sunny beach, the exact opposite of the front cover ! The music has electronic-techno like sounds that blend in well with the music throughout the album. The album is very upbeat for the most part, a great album."
5,industrial rock fans rejoice,"this is an album of industrial bliss. much better, yet easier to chew on than their first disc, it is a must have for industrial and metal fans alike. hard, yet quite melodic at times, it will keep you interested from start to finish. favorite tracks: 1, 6, 7."
3,Quite good,"Not as good when compared to Herzeleid. But more synths (good for me), and still some very good songs, like Alter Mann and Du Hast (you hate)"
4,Ach du metal!,"I first heard this band's cover of Depeche Mode's ""Stripped"" and thought it was awsome....especially Charlie Clauser's remix. Sehnsucht was their current CD so I bought it. (Since then I have gotten all the others). This is a spectacular metal disc. Every song is great, some virtually perfect. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because Du Hast (their signature song here in the US) is a direct rip of Ministry's ""Just One Fix"" from Psalm 69, and nobody can tell me that Rammstein wasn't familiar with it because Ministry has virtually sired this entire genre.Besides that, anyone who buys this album will love it, even those who normally avoid metal. It's that good."
1,"This tape stinks in my opinion, and they have no experience.","This group has no experience. I say this because they have no real rhythm, and Till Linderman the lead singer, does not sing he talks. I used to like Rammstein but now I hate them, I hate there Du Hast song, and I hate Till's Vocal style of not singing, he talks."
5,Du Hast to buy this CD!,Amazing CD that is a perfect match for any experimental industrial fans or past metal fans. The German lyrics make it even more unique and enjoyable to listen to. I even find myself singing and not knowing what the heck I'm saying...it's quite amusing. I'm seeing them in Philadelphia in June and have heard their concerts are powerful! I can't wait!!! Du Hast to own this CD!
4,Some of Germany's better aggro output,"Rammstein is industrial with a pretty good helping of heavy-metal. They remind me quite a bit of Ministry, but the German lyrics make it even more disturbing than Al Jourgenson's twisted raving. Once translated the lyrics lack subtlety, but the content of their words isn't where Rammstein is strong. Their guitars are phenomenal, their drums gut-shaking, their keyboard work absolutely splendid, their vocals demonic, and their bass truly ear-blasting. All together, Rammstein is a sonic cocktail of raw anger. Their music vibrates every molecule in your body and projects you onto a plane of pure rage, allowing you to vent all that pent-up bile from all the little things in life that really get to you, leaving you feeling cleansed. Truly wonderful for fans of the heavy. Tracks to give a special listen to: Tier, Buck Dich, Alter Mann, Kuss Mich"
3,It just rocks!,"So you live in Alabama and you don't speak german. It's Ok. Rammstein speaks the international language of great music. So the lyrics are supposed to be dark and dirty. What you don't know can't hurt you, right? Anyway, this is a really good metal/industrial album with a few lighter/melodic songs too. It's the perfect disc to put on while having a Heineken and bratwurst with Heidi. And if you don't like it, you can schlobbin ze nobben."
2,"I like it, but I don't love it","The style isn't bad. I just don't think it has enough great songs. Du Hast is the exception. That song will always get you going. It is incredible. The rest of the Cd, is questionable. You might want to give it a try though, if you like White Zombie, Static X, or other hard music."
3,Rammstein bumps into greatness... then keeps walking.,"After being immersed for years in club music, I've been recently wandering around all musical genres to cultivate more original sources of energetic, workout-motivating music. Du Hast seduced me with a rare (at least for the mainstream) mutation of metal and techno that I haven't heard since Scooter's ""Fire"", another song I adore, and so I bought the album. It was quite amusing at first, hearing an entire album in German that reminded me of Mortal Kombat (where Engel resides on a soundtrack) and WWF Raw music. But after that novelty wears off the truth reveals itself. Sensucht and Buck Mich are reasonable runners-up to Du Hast in terms of catchy, energetic tunes, and Stripped is an interesting closer. But when they venture onto power ballads and ""plain German hard rock"" (not that I'm an expert on that), sitting through the entire album becomes a chore. Next time I suggest that they take what they know works best and run with it."
5,In two words -- Hauntingly Beautiful,"This album is so incredible. Although in my opinion, their worst, it still soars so far above American music. So many songs in America have the depth of a rain puddle. The songs on this album...God, the symbolism is incredible. The most stunning song is the shamefully underrated Klavier. When I listened to it, I started the cry. The lyrics are just that....beautiful and sad. Spiel Mit Mir provides a bit of a preview the gothic metal undertones present on their third album, and the way Till sings it is just chilling. Its so hard to classify this band because with almost every song their style changes completely. What's more, is they do the transitions so well. Definitely well worth the cost."
5,refreshingly incredible!,"I was never really an industrial music fan but I was turned to this great band by hearing one of their songs which happened to be off their 1st album. I immediately thought these guys were fantastic. I only judged that by their music, nothing else. Then I came to know that it's Rammstein. From there on, I became huge fan until today. ""Sehnsuht"" has to be their best in my opinion. If you think otherwise, it's because the samples...and you have to get the cd to experience the killer sound of Rammstein. By the way, it's a shame that such a great band like them virtually get no airplay in the U.S nowadays! Yes, sure they made some stir with 'du hast"". After that , they virtually got no exposure. Yet there's countless of worthless, talentless ...out there which isn't worth a penny yet is played daily on Mtv and radio. That just tells you how this country is screwed up."
5,A Very Good CD,"Rammstein is a german band that combines heavy rock with strong lyrics and a bit of techno, thought not to much. This is, in my opinion, their best album. It includes their most popular song Du hast(You Have(and yes, its have, not hate, trust me, I know german)) It includes others of their best music like Engel(Angel) which has a good beat and overall tone. I also like Ich Will(I Will) which starts nice and slow and takes its time to work into a good pace. There are many other good songs on this Album. Its great for techno or metal fans, and becuase its in German you don't need to worry about the lyrics."
5,Get the Sehnsucht cd without the english translations!,If you want to know what Till is singing don't listen to the incorrect translations of Engel and Du Hast! Use your search engine and find the translations. They sound horrible in english! The music and english do not do well together even with Till's sexy voice. So get some other Sehnsucht bonous track and enjoy the power of Rammstein!
4,"Good, clean (only if you don't know German), fun!","There is not much to say about Rammstein except the fact that they are so cool! Even though like 90% of their songs are of a....questionable nature (incest, rape, killing, homosexual practises), it's still cool! Sehnsuct, Du Hast, Speil Mit Mir are some of the best. The way the singer sings is funny and interesting due to all those funky German pronunciations! The guitar is nice and heavy and along with the keyboards, it sounds like it could be heavy techno/dance music but it still boils down to good ol' heavy metal! At certain points, you will just have to smile and chuckle, just because it's all in German."
5,Rammstein Rocks!,"What raw intensity! I never heard the term ""Industrial"" Metal before, however, itdefinitely suits this style of rock. Certainly has an edgey presentation....which I absolutely love.Am not well versed in German rock. I don't understand a word they are saying, which is irrelevent....I feel the music to my core, as the CD is turned up MEGA LOUD!!(The only way to listen to it, truly.)My first exposure to them was while viewing ""The Matrix"" in 1999. Du Hast,#5. From that moment, I was hooked! There is not one song in this selection that I don't like, which is unusual. I do have a favorite, however, #9.This will be my second purchase cos the first CD has a few skips.Long live Rammstein, and their unique, in-your-face style! Keep it coming!"
5,The best cd i have ever listened to!,"This cd is the best cd i have ever heard. I asked this one guy for some German heavy metal in Sam Goody. I was amazed! This is true heavy metal at it's best! Buy this cd, it is way better than any other bands you have heard, trust me. All of my friends like these guys."
5,Lots of Info for Boaters,"We don't have a boat yet, but have a lake nearby so are contemplating it. This book is quite interesting as it describes different types of boats (runabout, bass boat, etc.) and what to consider before purchasing one.Then it has lots of info on handling a boat, like how to run an inlet or docking and anchoring. It's a little scary seeing how much there is to learn about boats and motors. The info is quite practical on the proper load distribution in the boat and motor angle adjustment and how it affects performance. It covers maintaining, repairing and even towing the boat (selecting a trailer and tow vehicle)."
1,magic 8 ball,it broke straight away!!!!!! its stupid coz it kept saying 'dont count on it' ugh i HATED it why did my parents buy it????????????????????????????????????????????
1,Piece of junk,I bought this to give at our family 'white elephant' gift exchange thinking it would be kind of fun. You can't read the answers because the blue juice it's floating around in is too dark. I'd send it back. That's what I'm going to do now...
4,it's a great toy,"I think this toy is a great toy, not only because it's fun and a little educational. but really because it is durable. i had one and it lasted me four years."
5,A very fun toy!,"It is very fun.In my words,I'm meaning to tell you to buy this product!It's just nice."
2,Only one answer,"I was so excited to get this key chain because I've always loved the magic eight ball. Imagine my dismay when I realized my eight ball was stuck. No matter the question, my answer was ""ask again later."" Shortly after receipt, my eight ball leaked blue dye -- just like most of the other reviews."
1,Doesn't show one answer,I dislike this toy because you can view a minimum of 6 answers at a time. The flat side should be facing up but instead the corner is stuck up so you cannot clearly read it. Bad deal.
3,This is not *just* a toy!,"What with the ever increasing popularity of oracles for ducking personal culpability this is a godsend! A true American masterwork of getting answers the way you need them -- quickly.Tough day at the track and you need a long shot to square it all up? Two fiancés and can't make a decision which one to marry? Considering doing a little backstabbing at work to get a promotion but afraid it might backfire? Unsure if the IRS will audit you if you take those extra dependant deductions for the dog, the cat and the pastry iron? Can't decide between laudanum and lithium? In steps the 8 ball. It's magic! You don't have to worry about thinking things through or trouble yourself with endless anxiety that you can't pick a winner to save your life. Just ask this semi-animate object what to do!Just don't leave it in the sunshine or on your dashboard."
4,Looking to write well? Try this one!,"I have taught comp. for several years, and -- through happy and not-so-happy experiences with textbooks -- have come to select this as my all-time favorite. Its 6th edition is familiar to me, and now I'm going on with the 7th. The only thing lacking in this book is a truly thorough introduction to the ins and outs of the persuasive essay."
5,Needed for school,"Wanted it ASAP, told that to the seller and it didn't get shipped until 2 1/2 weeks later! I will never use them again for absolutely anything. Even if it wasn't in a rush!"
3,Needs More,"This looks/smells/tastes like it could be the stuffing or filling for something else. To make this a complete meal, add some refried beans, salsa, and roll up in a tortilla for a very tasty burrito."
3,Good book for the beginner,"The main complaint I had was that I was expecting to see alot more on techniques rather than history. About 1/2 of the book is spent discussing the history of how BJJ began and how it has evolved MMA. The technique section was OK and didn't have anything new. This would be a great book for someone who's just started doing BJJ, or thinking about getting into BJJ"
3,Jiu Jitsu for MMA,"This book contains a lot of verbiage about the history of jujitsu, which unfortunately was not what I was hoping for. It is also entirely no-gi based.The book does a good job of breaking down the most common positions two fighters can get in. For example, winning from the bottom is broken down into attacks from the guard which is further broken down into attacks from the closed guard, and so on.If you are looking for a more in depth technique book, check out Jiu Jitsu University by Saulo Ribero."
5,Great Book!!!,"Includes in depth discussion about all aspects of the game and even incorporates some of the ""Jujitsu"" techniques and tactics used by Sakuraba against the Gracies. The techniques are demonstrated by the actual instructors at the New York school as well as Renzo himself. I tried a number of the techniques against an experience grappling opponent and they worked without a hitch. Great stuff!"
4,Introduction to the Basics of Grappling,"This book outlines the foundation of grappling, with the primary emphasis focused on ground grappling tactics. It serves as a primer to those interested in the basics of mixed martial arts and BJJ.The book is very well written by the coauthor Danaher, who has a graduate school education, in education. The topics are discussed in a short yet, sufficient manner to accurately describe said topic.This book along with the aid of a competent instructor and a hard working training partner, will assist one on their journey to becoming an effective grappler. Just do not forget the other aspects of the martial arts. There are many paths to the top of the mountain, choose wisely. ""To learn about the universe one must study more than one planet,"" Miyamoto Musahsi."
5,"Great, great book!","Renzo and John really did it with this one. This is the best book out there on FIGHTING - whether for sport or self protection. The authors really get into the 3 phases of combat (""free-movement""; ""the clinch""; and ""ground fighting""). There is also some great historical information on the evolution of Jujitsu since the Meiji Restoration, how Judo revolutioned the art, and the innovations since.This book is not full of ""how-to"" photos, but has more than enough photos to get their points across. I also own Renzo's other book ""Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: Theory and Technique"", and it is well laid out with scores of color photos. However, I'd recommend this one, ""Mastering Jujitsu"", over his other book or any other Brazilian Jiu Jitsu text.Buy this book."
3,Renzo Gracies mastering JuJitsu,"I found this book interesting. It covers the history behind the art however it does not illustrate a lot of movements. This book contains only the very basic moves a white belt may learn. Honestly if you are thinking about this book, consider a month of lessons and ""google"" BJJ and you'll know as much as this book will cover."
4,Good Book on Underlying Theory,"This is a great book that explains in detail the underlying theory behind Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and ground combat.This is NOT a technique book. While There are pictures of techniques in the book the main idea behind the text is the underlying theory that Ground Fighters need to engage in while fighting.Renzo does a great job of explaining the phases of combat, and details strategy for each of those phases. He also cites examples of current MMA fighters and shows how they apply the principles that he is explaining.This book requires some knowledge of ground grappling to understand the strategy behind what is going on."
3,"Not bad, won't learn much techniques though.","The book is great for the history of jiujitsu and philosophies of fighting and stuff like that. But if you're hoping to learn a wide range of new techniques, it's not in this book. If you're a blue belt already, or even a white belt like me, you won't learn many new things. Get a better book if you're looking for something that covers moves. This book has very few pictures compared to text."
1,More concerned with MMA; egotistical,"Throughout the book the authors confound Brazilian Jiujitsu with competition mixed martial arts. While the it is often used in this sport I understand the importance of bringing it into context however this is really a book about MMA with full section dedicated to concepts and fighting methods that have nothing to do with BJJ. Furthermore, the book is long on the ""this is why our art is the best"" arguments that are tacky and dead-ended. We already bought your book, we're interested in BJJ, don't be a egotist about it. To accomplish this end the authors often set up paper arguments in favor of other styles/methods so they can knock them down and ""prove"" BJJ's superiority.The one piece I did enjoy was reading about the history and methodological evolution of the art."
4,Another Gracie Contribution,"This is another fine contribution to Jiu-Jitsu from the Gracie Family. Renzo Gracie gives us clear insight into Jiu-Jitsu history, theory, and tactics. Many concepts are made easy to understand. This book is a benefit to beginners and advanced students alike."
2,Outdated by other books,"Its a good book, it provides historical background and facts that state why Jiu Jitsu is better for fighting than other martial arts and combat sports.I just think that the best Jiu Jitsu books have more techniques or are more detailed about specific aspects of fighting.I recomend you get other books that cover the basics with more detail like the Master Text by Helio Gracie or the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Theory and technique by the same Renzo with Royler. Saulo Riveiro has the best of all for sport, covering all aspects."
5,very insightful,"very insightful book on brizilain jiu jitsu and unexpectedly jiu jitsu in general, the history lesson alone (which is the most accurate ive read) is worth the price alone. He dosent show a lof of techniques though there are more then enough considering i could look that up on youtube or learn it in class if needed but he focuses on the underlying principles of his training and explains the distinction between his art and the arts of others. I do not know what his formal education was but he is a very educated writer and renzo gracies critical thinking keeps the book interesting at every part."
2,"not great, not terrible","There wasn't anything new here but if you don't have any other books on jujitsu, it's o.k."
5,Very helpful,This book is a must have for EMT students. The intructor recommended it and for good reason. Very helpful in studying and test preparation.
1,never received,I ordered this book over a month ago and it has not arrived it has been paid in full I have written several emails and phone calls and nothing has happened. I NEED THIS BOOK
2,"Dated, But Kept My Interest","This movie is VERY dated and does not stand the test of time. A mediorce movie in its day, is not even that by today's standards especially by how much we now know about the condition of Titanic. Not a very plausible movie, I mainly just bought because I wanted to see it as a kid and did not. If you see this movie in a $1 rack - buy to satisfy your curiousity, but do not waste a good afternoon with it. Save it for a rainy day when there is nothing else to watch."
4,Raise the Titanic,Man Friday/Raise the Titanic (Red Carpet Double Feature)I bought this DVD for only the one movie (Raise the Titanic). It is one of my favorites. I probably won't even watch the other one.
5,Raise the Titanic,Have this movie on VHS and have been looking for years for a DVD copy. One of my favorite all time movies.
4,Raise the Titanic,"I am guilty of being a Titanic nut...................so I bought this package in spite of all the negative things I have read about Raise the Titanic..............I actually was expecting nothing and was surprised I liked the movie in many ways.............the three best scenes were Alec Guiness as a surviving Titanic officer in a very moving performance, the raising of the ship, and best of all its long delayed arrival in New York with a very very emotional shot of it sailing past the World Trade Center...............an effect obviously the film makers could not envision in 1980.There are negatives................of course the wreck was found five years later and it was confirmed it broke up before sinking, but to me the worst error was the trumpet...............the band on the Titanic was strings only..............oh well, I am glad I bought the dvd for those three scenes I mentioned."
5,Raise the Titanic,Super movie bought for RAISE THE TITANIC NEED MORE LIKE THIS. This is a classic and will be around for a long time.
3,It's time for a restoration and a re-release,"No one will ever accuse ""Raise the Titanic"" of being a great or even good movie, but for those of us who are obsessed by the Titanic, we will always treasure the (very well done) scenes of the film when the great ship is raised and, of course, her poignant long-delayed arrival in New York (with the World Trade Center as a back-drop). I have a copy of the UK release of the film and although its in widescreen, the colors are very washed-out and the undersea photograph to dark to really understand what is going on. With the centenary of the sinking arriving soon, it would be appropriate to restore and re-relese the film - hopefully in blu-ray."
3,Titanic,Not much of a story line but I am a Titanic fan and collect all Titanic movies. Fun to see Obi Wan Kinobi in a different role although the force was not involved in raising the Titanic.
3,Raise the Titanic and Man Friday,"I bought this item, because i love the Film Raise the Titanic, and its hard to find the movie anywhere. I didnt care for Man friday, i found that film ridiculous and hard to followRaise the Titanic has a great score, and wonderful cast, if u are into sunken ship wrecks, then u will like this film, the story itself is a little dull and u dont see the ship raise until towards the end of the film, im not certain as to why the writers felt they could pull this story off as the ship itself broke in two peices when it sank.However early films before james camerons Titanic, such as a Night to Remember always showed the Titanic sinking entirely as one complete vessel. When i saw this film in the 80's i didnt know titanic had broken in two."
4,On 'Man Friday',"""Man Friday"" is a beautiful variation on the Robinson Crusoe Story. It contains unexpectedly fine performances by Peter o'Toole and Richard Roundtree. And the twist it puts on the well-known story has enduring worth for all of us.... For that reason, its curious lapses are forgivable.I'm very glad that I've seen this movie. Frank Braio"
5,Good movie,"Saw ""Raise the Titanic"", great old movie. haven't seen Man Friday yet.So far no problems :)"
1,Raising the Titanic Lousy!,"I'm hooked on Clive Cussler novels and when I saw there was a movie made from the novel ""Raising the Titanic,"" I jumped on it. I got the movie and watched it yesterday. It was lousy! Made in the 70s with an obvious 70s feel to it (which was tolerable), but the actor portraying Dirk Pitt was wrong, his portrayal of Dirk Pitt was wrong, there was very little action although the novel was filled with it, they didn't tie up plot lines, etc. In short, it was terrible. There's another movie on the same disk, ""Man Friday."" I have no idea what it is about, but I'll give it a shot and see if it's worth keeping the disk, although I doubt it. If you're a Cussler fan like I am, keep the novel, but don't, repeat, don't get this movie."
4,nice to see on dvd,"These movies are finaly going to be on dvd, that's good, however since this disk is a budget title don't expect gloryous 5.1 audio and anamorphic widescreen video . I have been waiting to see raise the titanic in widescreen for years and it looks I will have to continue my wait, bummer."
2,If there is no other option,"I would recomend this title if you have to have this movie. I bought it for the Titanic title since there is no other way to have it by its own. The quality of the picture is at most ""fair"", the audio is in the same category. Like I said, I just buoght it because I loved the movie and the score. So there you have it. As soon as there is a remastered version I would buy it in a heartbeat."
4,Raise Titanic good movie,"I bought this for Raise the Titanic, a decent movie 3 star movie, but don't hold your breath for any blockbuster or special effects to compare to today. I like this movie for a simple reason, Alec Guinness (the original Obi-Wan) and his performance. He has a small part and steals the movie completely, in my opinion. I like like to rewatch this just for that reason....great actor."
3,Raise is a good movie/Couldn't finish Man Friday,"RAISE THE TITANIC is a good movie. It stands the test of time pretty well and is worth watching. I watched the first few minutes of MAN FRIDAY and had to stop (nothing against Richard Roundtree, but his singing isn't worth my time)."
2,Raise Titanic,I saw it years and years ago it was much better then but entertaining since I am a diehard Titanic Buff.
1,"Not the ultimate foreign B-movie, but close","The ""Furious"" is among the most hilarious films ever made. It is hilarious because it succeeds in failing every level that could make a dcent film. This is not as bad or as funny as Le's other masterpiece, ""Eye of the Dragon"" (undoubtebly the worst film of all time next to ""Caligula""), which Le directed. The key plot is not even worth being described for, nor are the characters. The action sequences, music, sound editing, are so off-key and pathetically dubbed, you can't help but laugh at it (not to mention a good script, direction, and acting, which this film thoroughly lacked). This is a very bad film, but for the ultimate comedy because of its effortless way to succeed at being a good movie at 1%, rent ""Eye of the Dragon"", which isn't even on sale here (and thank god for it), but it is worth renting. It is impossible to make a film as bad as that. Just impossible."
5,Buy Now,"These guys are a f@$#king unbelievable band. It took one song, i was hooked. They're the kind of band that doesn't have to grow on you.Seriously, if you can find this cd, pick it up, you wont be disappointed. I don't think it's left my cd player in months."
1,Boring screamo...,...Skip this and support alexisonfire and static lullaby for good screamo. Don't waste your money!
3,hmmm,I read someones review saying that this album had the best screaming u have ever heard. I think you are out of your f***ing mind. This guy of Funeral Of A Friend sounds like a whiny little b****. Sounds like a 7 year old girl. This guy cannot scream at all. Well the album sounds nice good guitar riffs. Thats why it gets 3 stars
4,Great Hardcore Music...,"I heard ""The Art Of American Football"" (which in my opinion is the best song on the EP) on a local radio station in L.A and was instantly hooked. Pick it up today, you wont be sorry..."
5,The best thrash metal album of all time?,"There are plenty of reviews here stating how great Darkness Decends by Dark Angel is; They are accurate. This is a thrash metal masterpiece. Fast, furious, intelligent, brilliant musicianship... there is nothing bad that can be said. Every second of every track is simply amazing. This might be the best thrash metal album of all time, the only competition is Slayer's Reign In Blood. Darkness Decends is a MUST HAVE for any metalhead. If you like stuff along the lines of early Metallica, Megadeth, Exodus, Mercyful Fate, or any heavy-fast stuff get this CD right away."
5,"Awesome, but be aware that the 1999 Relativity release is NOT a REMASTER","You can't fault this amazing album on it's musical content, which is ferocious and stands the test of time way better than 90% of old-school thrash albums, BUT the 1999 Relativity Records version of the CD is NOT a remaster as stated on it's packaging and in the title on Amazon. I bought it and checked out the tunes in a WAV file editor as well as using the spectrum analyzer function and there is ZERO difference between this edition and the original cd released earlier."
5,Emotionally powerful,"Because it's so intimate a portrayal of real-life experiences, this book moved me to tears. Each story relates, with differing degrees of depth and breadth, an individual and a family's encounter with the Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency (HANDLE), tracing their stories before, during, and after the unique therapy program. Anyone interested in addressing issues with diagnoses like autism spectrum disorders, stroke, head injury, CHARGE Syndrome, Tourette's Syndrome, Down's Syndrome -- and ""ordinary"" learning disabilities -- ought to read this book."
5,A good product.,"This is a very fine product, excellent quality and content. The nudity was good, although it could've been somewhat more generous. The model was excellent and the yoga was highly impressive. This is a fine addition to any collection."
4,Totally Pure....,"Shelby has a voice much like Alison Krauss in the sense that you will NEVER hear such a smooth voice with such a beautiful sound. While these albums do sound dated compared to the other folk stuff that was being released around the time, they make a great snapshot of a time and place when this music was totally accepted. ""Angel On My Shoulder"", which made the top 30, is about as sweet and mellow as you can ask for, but it has an innocence which you won't find anywhere else.The other highlight for me is the version that Shelby presents of ""Cast Your Fate To The Wind"". It starts out nice and soft, but once the brass kicks in, it soars off the edge and into the horizon. Absolutely fantastic."
3,Brush up on your French!,"I found that this work lacked the gripping characters, suspense and hilarity that characterise the author's other works. The characters were particularly disappointing; the heroine is a work of insipidity and the hero moves from being a stiff, but likeable country bumpkin to an irritatingly controlling male who is invested overnight with incredibly pretentious society manners.Nonetheless, the period detail is fascinating as always and there are moments of fun. I'd also recommend brushing up on your French before reading this book. I don't know any, so perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it much."
4,"Entertaining,",I recently rediscovered this book and was happy to have found it again. I enjoyed it much better the second time around.
2,Did not like this one,"I love Georgette Heyer's style and have read most of her books, but I am having a difficult time getting through this one. My first complaint is that there is too much usage of the French language. For example, there is an entire poem in French. I took three years of French in school, albeit a long time ago, and yet I could not make the translations of the poem or the conversational phrases. The story is filled with useless conversations in English. I am planning on finishing the book, I am halfway through, but it is difficult when I am not particularly enamored with the characters. This is unusual for Heyer's style. I am disappointed because the plot is unique if it could have been delivered by more interesting characters."
3,A Touch of Manners,"Cleone Charteris spuns Philip Jettan because he has no town polish in Georgette Heyer's fun filled POWDER AND PATCH. But Philip wants her and he assumes the frills of a man of fashion to claim his bride.Fun, fun from beginning to end.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and HAINTS."
3,Not Mine,"Never bought this product, so while it might be a nice book, I didn't buy it, so either Amazon screwed up or someone hacked my account."
1,Buyers beware,"I found this DVD during a trip abroad, and - considering the very limited number of music DVDs with 50s rockers such as Gene Vincent - I was more than happy about it. Until I played it, that is. To call the sound & picture quality horrible is an understatement. (Unfortunately, the description of the primitive recording technology used is written on the INSIDE cover, and is thus hidden until you unwrap the DVD, and then it is too late.) Anyway, it has been sitting on my shelf for about a year now, and will probably remain there without ever seeing the inside of my DVD player again. I hope I can save some other would-be buyers from a similar disappointment."
1,"If you're going to write a sequel, read the predecessors","The summary pretty much says it. Aside from the names of the characters, this book had nothing in common with the other two. Characters spoke and acted differently, and all the fun was just sucked out of the experience."
2,Doesn't deserve to be considered part of the series.,"Thepreviously brilliant and flamboyant Captain Jester has been reduced to a slightly unorthodox businessman. The characters, on the whole, are dull, soulless cardboard cutouts of their former selves. Conflicts were resolved too easily, with a minimum of humor. My last thought upon finishing it was, ""That's it! "" I would have preferred to wait for another ""Phule"" book and never get one, rather than seeing the series shamelessly trampled like this. (It was, however, tolerable if you didn't think of it as part of the ""Phule's Company"" series.) I hope Robert Asprin is ashamed of himself for putting his name on this, even with someone else to share the blame."
2,A series with nowhere to go...,"It is unfortunate that this series has fallen into a repetition of the same old gag. The premise, perhaps, was doomed from the start. Wacky bunch of military misfits are foisted off on equally misfit commander(promising, but here's the fatal flaw), wacky misfit commander is rich as Croesus. Therefore, instead of interestingly thinking or fighting its way out of trouble, the unit simply BUYS its way out. Perhaps this is a bit of wish fullfillment on Asprin's part considering his recent financial troubles, but it is a disappointing come-down from the thoroughly charming (if a bit formulaic) ""Myth"" books."
1,For die hard phule fans only,"I similarly found this book to be disappointing, and not up to past standards."
1,"Awful, awful book",All the negative reveiws are correct. The most endearing things about the first two Phule's Company books were that each of the character's had their own Voice and were described in such a way to provide Character. Aspirin's subletly is replaced by a much more heavy handed effort that fails by trying so hard. 'Blah' is the word that describes the book best.
1,Weird little word-choices too,"Dumbed down, maybe deadline pressure. Everything an author or would-be author would read and start to pity the forced action of formerly delightful characters.I don't know who ""contributor"" P.Heck is, and now I really don't care to find out how he may have butchered Mark Twain in a sort of revisionist historic mystery setting.What is it with the bizarre word choices? Is it a cry for help (or hidden excuse) to the Literary Critics? In some rarified language? Even the names chosen for 'new' characters are strange."
1,Very disappointing,"I have looked forward to this sequel ever since reading the first two books. Many of the characters from those books were either greatly ignored or just seen in passing. Also it had Willard Phule worrying about money of all things. This from a man that bought a hotel so he could have the manager help him. A man who bought 2 Port-A-Brains (cost of a small corportion) so he would not have to possibly wait for a pay terminal. I can't believe Asprin wrote this. Makes me think Heck wrote it and Asprin get the credit (read as BLAME). Makes it very doubtful that I would buy a 4th one, especially if anyone's name is on it besides Asprin."
2,Too Bad,"I loved Phule in the early books. Unfortunately, the series has been going downhill ever since Asprin began collaborating, apparently in an effort to increase his productivity. The latest entries in the series just don't have the same sense of fun that the early ones had.Very disappointing."
2,A Phule and His Money,"This book has none of the belly laughs associated with the first two books. It is written in an entirely different style, leading one to wonder if Robert Asprin or Peter Heck wrote it.If this were the first in a series, the series would founder and die at book two."
2,not great for asprin; still better than many others,"upon reading the other reviews, i agree that robert asprin must have left much of the writing to his collaborator. the characters, who seem like old friends after the first two novels, do not act (or even talk!!) as you would expect. however, the story was still entertaining and had some good laughs. nowhere near as bad as ""sweet myth-tery of life"", the worst book i have ever read by asprin."
2,Disappointing,"While I did read reviews before I read the book, I read it with an open mind, determined to make my own decision. Frankly, I had to agree with the negative reviews. This book was a let-down from the other two Phule books. I did not find it nearly as funny, and it was a chore to get through it. The characters were not as interesting, nor was the plot as involving. If you've read the other Phule books and enjoyed them, go ahead and read this, but don't make it a priority. This is something to read on a long plane trip, or something similar."
2,Disappointing,"As a long time fan of Robert Asprin ( going back to Thieves World ) I was very disappointed in this installment of such a fun series. It's pretty obvious right from the start that somebody else basically wrote the book. The character's voices, mannerisms and speech patterns all changed. Sushi no long speaks with an accent in broken english, and the other characters also lose that individualism that the first two books had. You could pull dialog from the first two books and pretty much know who was speaking by the way it was written but that was lost in this book. All in all it read more like an attempt to make money on a hit series than a real effort at continuing, what had been, a great bunch or books."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I loved the first two Phule's books-but this one feels as if it was written by someone else. It had no depth, no flavor, limited humor, and none of the characters rang true--they all seemed flat and expressionless.This one is a waste of money--don't bother."
3,"Not bad, but....","Not the best I've ever read, either....and this is based on getting to page 33. None of the characterizations feel ""right""-from Tusk-anini, to Escrima's speech patterns, to a sudden change in gender for General Blitzkreig's aide. I'm going to finish it, but I can tell that it's not going to be as good as the first two."
1,A great disappointment.,"I've been a fan of RL Asprin ever since I picked up his Myth-Adventures series--I've eagerly read every book he's written, and no few of the anthologies he's edited. That's why A Phule And His Money was such a great disappointment. The plot was all Asprin--clever and full of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was never realized; whoever did the actual writing whether it was Heck or Asprin (the smart money is on Heck) absolutely massacred the storyline. Emphasis was placed on irrelevant and uninteresting points, and the book had none of Asprin's characteristic incisive satire and wise wit. The bottom line--after finishing the book, the reader is left with the nagging feeling that the book was just a first draft."
2,lazy attempt at a sequal,This book lacks any of the traits that I have come to expect from this author. The book has a simplistic plot with little or no humor. It is overall a poor representation of Mr Asprin's work.
1,No one will ever convince me this was written by Mr. Asprin,"This book bears only a superficial resemblance to the first two books. Plot elements are barely strung together at all. No real action is ever taken by Phule than to pull out his credit card and propose business deals. Problems seem to come and magically resolve themselves with no apparent action taken on the part of the principals. This is probably the last in the series because few people that read this book will ever buy another ""Phule"" book. Which is really sad because I loved the first two. I can only guess that the publisher invoked a contract clause allowing the book to be finished by a ghost author. The humor is lame and the plot is almost as bad. I normally see better FanFic published on the Web. With all apologies to Mr. Asprin who has brought me so much enjoyment with his previous works, this one's a dud!"
3,Not his best work.,"I've been a big fan of Robert Asprin for a while now. My former girlfriend started me on the Myth series and I was hooked.I've thoroughly enjoyed the Phule series, until now. I'm not sure what happened between ""Phule's Paradise"" and ""A Phule and His Money"", but Asprin just doesn't seem to do anything special with his characters.One of the things I like about Asprin's writing is his character development. However, the dialogue in ""A Phule and His Money"" is flat and static, lacking the subtle nuances that define each character's personality.The plot was a bit disjointed as well, leaving several gaping holes in the story line (weren't they going to take on the Yakuza? )It is still a worthwhile read. The Asprin wit still shines through in places, it just isn't as bright as we're used to."
2,Dissappointing,"This book was very disappointing. The previous two Phule books were great, but this one was choppy and forced; the plot seemed terribly contrived and the characters uninspired caricatures of what went before. It was a chore to read, but nowhere near as bad as the sequel..."
2,Disappointing,"I've happened across every book in this series completely by accident, and until now it's been a pleasant surprise every single time. This time? Well, it was a pleasant surprise to see a new ""Phule"" book, but until the last few chapters, it just didn't... FEEL right.Not a book I'd recommend (although I would strongly recommend the previous two books in the series)."
1,"The ""Phule and his money"" was me.","One has to wonder if Mr. Asprin wrote this book or did Mr. Heck just get stuck with it. There are way to many inaccuracies with this book to be the supposed writer block and could only come from someone not familiar with the series or from someone who could care less about it. The story line is flat, the humor is non-excitant, and the characters that where so alive the first books are cardboard cut outs now. I am normally a big fan of Mr. Asprin's work, but if there ever is another installment to this series I will read it, but I will not buy it first."
5,Awesome,Just got it and it is just as good as the first time I watched it back when Saturday anime played on SciFi!
4,"Cute Girl, great villian.","Remember the good ol days when a creature could be scary without having to say a word. Zeirem is creepy, intelligent, and visually interesting, all without uttering a word. Oh yeah, Iria's pretty cool too."
5,This is just an amazing anime!,"This video really blew me away..... It's just has a great story, good voice acting, and well, it's just cool. U should buy it!"
2,"Good story, but falls short as an overall production","The concept of ""Iria"" is unique and entertaining as a story, it also does an ok job at engaging the audience. However, you would be mislead if you expect a feature film quality production from this DVD. The music is poor, the action is simple, the look and detail of the backgrounds is a bit shallow and the pasing gets really slow at times.The best context for this DVD is as an ok TV Series, but it is certainly not ""Ghost in the Shell"", it is not ""Princess Mononoke"", it is not ""Ninja Scroll"", and it is certainly not ""Akira"". So don't raise your expectations of ""Iria"" to the level of any of these films."
2,"Good Idea , Poorly Executed","I had very high hopes for this anime, but was sorely dissapointed. The idea and design of Iria and Zeram was great. I had watched the live action version and had expected more from the anime version. The pace was too slow and the soundtrack died in spots essential to making it more exciting. The story itself was very shallow. With plot and pace being so lack luster, it becomes easy to overlook the outstanding job of animation. Artwork is the only reason why I rate this better than a 1. This is , if you watch it objectively, an example of anime failure."
3,interesting storyline,"I found it to be a good start. I hope that more of the storyline comes out on DVD. I liked the premise and thought the first few episodes is a hint of a good elaborate series. However if you are looking for closure from episodes 1-6, wait until more comes out."
4,My first Anime,"I orignally watch Iria on HBO about three years before it was released in the US. I love it. The movie follows Iria, a young female bounty hunter. It is set in a far away galaxy. The problem is this un-killable monster from outer space comes ""Zeiram"". To make a long story short it becomes a fight between Iria and Zeiram, with some strange things a long the way.I gave this a 4 star rating because, the movie feels too long, over 2 and half hour."
5,Iria: Zeiram the Animation,Iria: Zeiram the Animation is a must have! I first saw this on the sci-fi channel years ago (you know when they had anime on Saturday at 1:59). I'm just starting my anime collection but can already tell Iria is one of the best. If you've never bought an anime vidio GET THIS ONE it ROCKS! The animation is not the most beautiful you will ever see but the story and characters will consume you within the first minutes of the movie. MUST HAVE
3,"Good...good, wait, that's it?","The anime is great, with a fairly invigorating storyline, but I found myself staring at a very abrupt ending.The ending left several loose ends and didn't cap the story with Grin, or the death of him, and recovery time to Iria.Not quite the best Anime ever, I'll save that one for Lodoss."
4,Old school Anime,"I remember seeing this on the Sci-fi Channel, or Cartoon Network, or something back in the 90's and thinking I have no idea waht this is but it's cool. I caught it in the middle and since then had seen it from the beginning and even caught the live action films that inspired it.Iria: Zeiram the animation is old school anime but still holds up today. it's futuristic yet retro/eurasian designs are still some of the most inspired I've seen and the action and weapons are top notch. A great little series to pass some time."
2,"overated, unengaging story","I'm really surprised at the high reviews.On the positive side, IRIA has some interesting character design and atypical elements of science fantasy. Plus the DVD is about 180 minutes long.On the negative, IRIA is unengaging and more action than story or character based. I found myself bored, and quickly not caring what was going on.There's nothing particularly special about the animation, though it does feature some nicer background paintings. Hold frames of IRIA are drawn better than most. IRIA pales in comparison to GHOST IN THE SHELL, ARMITAGE III, NINJA SCROLL, GIANT ROBO, and even THE BIG O, in my opinion.A rental, at best."
2,Several pitfalls,"I didn't think this anime came close to the caliber of Ghost In the Shell or other top animes.First, you get a little tired of seeing the good guy constantly shoot at the indestructable monster to no avail.Second, the kids Iria befriends are so obnoxious that they become nothing but an annoyance.Third, the English dubbed voice of Iria is dreadful. Not only does it lack the cuteness of the Japanese voice, but the acting is worse than what you would hear in a cheesey car dealership commercial.I just began watching anime, and after seeing Ghost and Princess Mononoke, this was like watching Scooby Doo."
4,mermaid sans the red hair,"well, my daughter picked this up as she is a big ariel fan. very soon, she realised it was not just the red hair that was amiss but all the characters like- ursula is cassandra , eric is stefan. But nonetheless, she enjoyed it...and likes to watch it on weekends. the animation is good , and dialogues are simple ...so that even a 3 year old can understand. at the price it is being sold, it is a good buy...lena is cute."
3,Little Mermaid,"Product arrived as described. My mistake, I didn't look to see if it was the Disney version. No fault of the seller."
5,Its the best,"This is my favorite re-telling of the Little Mermaid [I've seen 3 diffrent vertions]Leana the little mermaid wants to meet a hansome prince and to the surprise of her talking pet dolphin Binks she does and shes in love prince Stephen so she make a deal with Casandra the sea witch trading her voice for a pair of legs,and meets two birds Cecil and Claudia,then... well see for your self."
1,lame!,"This is not the disney classic. Of course, now I see that I should have noticed the cover was not the Ariel we all know -- but still, false advertising!!! Plus, this company is not subject to Amazon return policies. I had 4 days to return it (rather than the normal 30 days). The movie is crap too."
1,Not what I wanted,"I was expecting the Little Mermaid I watched when I was a child, but when I got it the date showed that it had been produced in the early 90's not the 80's. I tried to watch it anyway, but I did not get past the first 15 minutes."
1,Horrible!,"( I'm 17 but thissite wouldn't let me review unless I'm a member, I'm not a member my mom is, so I had to resort to putting my review in this way!^-^;)Ugh! I really did not enjoy this movie at all. Bad animation, really bad acting, did I mention that I didn't like it? The reason why this even got a star is because it did a better job at sticking to the real story ( a lot was still changed though).Disney's movie is much much better even though it changed the story even more than this movie did and the anime is supposed to be really good too (made in 1979 and is the closest to the original story than the other two are.)My recommendations: Watch Disney's version,then the anime version(if you can find it), and then read the original story. After that, if you're still curious about this one, go ahead and watch it. You may like it, I don't know cause I'm not you, but I know I didn't like it!Thanks for lisening to my little rant, hoped it helped you. ^-^"
5,very cool,its a story about a half human and half fish that lives under the sea. Ariel is a 16 year old mermaid that is in love with a prince. She is a big dreamer and loves humans
5,Exceptional Resource Book,"I bought this for my scholarly son who is studying to be a congregational leader. It's a great resource book that he refers to often for his course work, and that we use in our Sabbath Bible studies. Some really interesting etymologies in the Greek."
4,Dr. Paul makes it easy to figure it out for yourself!,"I was a student of Dr. Paul's and his work on this volume has been faithful. This tool makes it a little easier for Pastors to perform word studies and still have time to be with people. The references to Kittel, Bauer-Arndt & Gingrich and other volumes is helpful. If you want a good and useful tool, order this now."
4,"Great translation, but paper is not the top quality","I like this Bible very much. Everyone made good comment about it. But if I tried to use highlighter to mark certain words, the highlighter mark can be seen from both side of the page clearly.I have other Bible using similar weight paper but not let ink penetrate so much. I wish this publisher using the paper that allowing highlighter marks."
2,I think the author just picked 100 random criminals and terrorists,"Meh. This was kind of dated, especially the bits about Al Quaeda and Osama Bin Laden, and some of the people profiled didn't really seem all that evil to me. With all the billions of people that have come and gone throughout human history, who of us can claim to know who were the very worst? But I suppose it's no better or worse than the many other books with the same theme."
5,"Oh c'mon, give this guy a break!","The book is clearly not the most reliable source, but reliability is hard to come by when authors are dealing with biographies of some lunatics like Gaskins, Dahmer, and so on. In fact, there are so many sources online that will contradict another source three more times.As far as the book, the set up is easy. It is a page turner. I found it to be extremely entertaining. Partially, I am giving this book good review because I was not looking for detailed specifics. You cannot ever do. The Evil 100 is just like some of these books that you read about kids who kill their parents, or kids who kill. Unreliable, but fiction-like entertaining.I recommend it for a good entertaining read and as a good first time reference/direction. It is as addictive as wikipedia despite its unreliable information."
3,Good stuff !,"Tough to fill Riot's Original Vocalist spot. Rhett (R.I.P) has a good voice thou, and Mark's riffs are vintage RIOT. If you like WASP you will enjoy ""Loanshark"". ""Restless Breed"" and ""Showdown"" are good songs on this album."
4,Bluesy Metal!,"Good disc, great vocals and hooks. If you appreciate blues-based metal, then you'll enjoy this disc! Not as heavy as modern day Riot, but it still rocks!"
2,Not Up to Par,"I've become a huge Riot fan over the past couple years and have been slowly collecting their catalog of albums. The first phase of the band with Guy Speranza and the three Tony Moore albums (Thundersteel, PoP, and Immortal Soul) are in my opinion the band(in reality Mark Reale)'s best work.Restless Breed falls short here. The riffs just aren't up to what I would expect from Reale and the vocals really hit me the wrong way. Forrester's voice is hard to listen to for a whole album as he screeches much of the time. The songwriting as well doesn't seem to come together here as maybe only the first track Hard Loving Man would make the cut on any of the first three albums. The rest of the album seems a bit lost and never gets it together.So, while not awful it is one of the weaker Riot albums."
4,A bit bluesier but still killer NWOBHM from America!,"God bless Rhett Forrester - now deceased. He gave this album more of a bluesier, almost Southern quality, but it's still essential steamhammer Riot that fits in much better with British compatriots like Saxon and Def Leppard (!) than with fellow U.S. bands of that time like Van Halen. Excellent songs (if ""Violent Crimes"" doesn't get your blood pumping, you're either an android or dead!), great playing...but cheesy album cover!"
2,Guy Speranza Where Are You?,"I'm a huge fan of Riot WITH their original lead vocalist-Guy Speranza. Without him, Riot is only half as good. Lead guitarist, Mark Reale, is great; but Guy's voice really made the band unique. The songs on this CD are very weak compared to Rock City, Narita, and Fire Down Under."
4,Traditional heavy metal,"""Restless breed"" was released before Riot became high priests of power metal, and it's the strongest effort from the band's earlier career. I think the material is even better on this one, than the highly praised ""Fire down under"".If you decide to give this album a shot, you're in for a good time of traditional heavy metal in form of the rocking ""Hard loving man"" and the speedy ""Loanshark"". Riot have the good taste to include a couple of slower/softer songs as well (no ballads `tho) like ""When I was young"" and ""Showdown"". Every heavy metal fan should own this album alongside with ""Rock city"" and ""Fire down under""."
2,Derrida Tries But Fails To Charm Us,"The problem with this book like Derrida's other books is that it's hard to read. Derrida thinks he is saying something so deep but he can't say it right, he always uses strange words that I don't know the meanings. I can't find them in my dictionary and I even have a French one. If he knew what he was talking about then maybe we could start talking, but he never makes his point. For example a real philosopher like Kahlil Gibran (remember ""The Prophet?) never wastes time but gets to the point. I think Derrida would like to be like Kahlil Gibran but he's going to have to work at it."
5,it is what it is,"This book is not for everyone. Derrida's poststructuralism made several new critical approaches possible, and his contribution to the analysis of language is interesting at least for that. If you are not a fan of Deconstruction, which means looking at the different parts of a text and how they make up the whole (rather than Destruction, which would mean taking apart the house), then this book is obviously not for you. You are looking for Harold Bloom, and you will find him. My suggestion is that you read this book only if you have an open mind and the desire to test your perspective on a number of subjects against that of one of this century's great philosophers."
2,Insipid,"Derrida is deep and profound in his philosophy in linguisitc yet fail to grasp the techniques of using languages himself. HE CAN'T WRITE! This book, like all his other works, is difficult to comprehend!"
3,What does this mean?,"I was unable to figure out what this book meant. I kept reading, hoping things would get clearer, but I got the impression that the language just kept on going round in self referential circles, not actually talking about anything clear that I could grasp. It's like, just when I thought it was about to come out and say something that made sense, it seemed to end up saying something else instead. Infuriating. Can someone please sum up what Derrida was trying to say here?"
2,Mediocre at best,"PROS:1. Nice size handset is easy to hold, and eliminates backgroundnoise amplification of smaller handsets.2. Good size buttons make dialing easy.3. Easy to read display is a help.CONS:1. Panasonic is notorious for short battery charge, and this modelis no exception. Max of 36 hours in standby, and dischargesrapidly when you use it.2. Very short low battery warning. It can go from first warningbeep to dead in under a minute.3. Sound quality is only fair. Picks up lots of interference, butnot as bad as the 2.4 ghz that it replaced.4. Factory set ring which is set so low that the phone can't beheard unless you are near it.5. Durability is not good. Have had it for 10 months, and forover a month the charger has not worked right. Soon to head tothe landfill.If you don't use this phone much, this model may work. If you area heavy user, due to battery problems, it will be useless."
2,Battery Problems,"The reception was great but I had to buy 3 different batteries over the course of a year. It would sit on the base unit all night, I'd make one call and it would be out. I would also have to shake the phone sometimes for it to receive a signal. Not a great phone."
2,"Terrible Battery, OK everything else",Battery quit holding a charge right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. I found the audio quality and reception to be less than average overall. I wish I had done more research before choosing a phone. Gave it two stars because it worked ok for a few months.
2,not built to last,"After a couple years use, the speaker is shot. Phone still dials and receives but I hear only dead silence. Not built to last and cheaper to buy a new - and different - phone than to fix. Also battery sucks."
1,Lousy battery life.,"I have two of these phones. Both started out with decent battery life, but after 6 months of use, the phones can hardly maintain a charge. I did follow their initial battery charge instructions completely, but that certainly does not seem to help.Needless to say, I am looking for alternatives."
1,If it was possible I would have given it 0 stars!!,"This is the worst adaptation of Cinderella that I have ever seen. I am very upset I wasted the money, I spent 9.99 on this (it also came with an awful adaptation of Snow White), the only reason I purchased it is because Cinderella (the Disney one) is not on dvd yet. We got about half way through both dvd's and threw them in the garbage!!!"
3,Not Disney But Entertaining!,"I was thrilled to discover this movie and allow my children (4 and 3 years old) to see an interpretation of a classic other than Disney's interpretation. They really loved it, and it was well worth the [price] I paid. Sure, the animation and the music aren't quite in the league of Disney, but the simplicity is part of the charm. I would certainly recommend it to other parents of small children."
3,super-mediocre,"This was only enjoyable at all because I watched it a lot as a kid, and because it's so bad it's funny."
1,Ick Ick Ick,"This is one movie that isn't worth the price...Animation is HORENDOUS (especially the fat step-sister_The voices are good but not suiting their characters, and the songs are horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Awful - Zero Stars in Reality,"My wife bought this at a store. I noticed that it was not from Walt Disney (not that Cinderella is any high water mark for WD; Pinnocchio is the best feature), and very tacky looking. Don't buy this for your child unless you want her/his eyes and ears to be a garbage can! Shopping for the Disney version now, which I agreed to buy if we tossed this piece of trash."
3,Late and scuffed!,"First the order took 17 days to arrive?!?! Whats with that?Then it comes in NO PACKAGING AT ALL!!!! It could have been wrapped in the cellophane type wrap to protect it from scratching and scuffing!While the ladder looks to be mechanically sound it has more scuffs and scratches than my 8' Werner that I have owned for 5 yrs and has traveled from MN to AZ. We have purchased numerous items thru Amazon, this gives cause to re-evaluate that practice.Not satisfied.....In conclusion: The ladder seems to be mechanically sound but looks like it is lightly used, that does not bode well for Amazon!I have to add the price was very good."
5,werner 6206 300 lb fiberglass 6ft ladder,Really like this ladder it is easy to use light weight and strudy. Shipping was fast and reasonable .give this A++ I bought this from Amazon.
4,Good ladder - poor quality control,"Ladder arrived, but all four rivets were missing that attached the right front rail to the top platform! I ""replaced"" these with machine screws/lockwashers/nuts and notified the Werner company of their quality control problem. Otherwise, excellent ladder."
5,review,I wanted this movie because the art work was featured in a book of mine. I had seen it once on television but could not find it to rent. Good film with nice cast.
4,Different...,Had a problem with the relationships portrayed in this film. Had the same problem back in the 60's when I first saw it. Can't put my finger on it. Strange!
2,MISUNDERSTANDING OF BYZANTIUM,"Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling ""Byzantine"" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman."
4,Pretty Good Floor Mat,"Pros:Stamped as made in USAPainted with true John Deere GreenSeems solid enoughFits pretty well in my Silverado 1500Cons:Slick surfaceGroves to the right are shallowDisclaimer: I am a John Deere guy, I am biased to the company. This floor mat wasn't going to get less then 4 stars based on the fact that my truck now supports John Deere."
5,Great product,"These floor mats are very thick and have the feel of quality about them. The edges are very easy to trim off for an exact fit in my vehicle. I wish I had bought the mats for the back seat, now. That will be my next purchase."
5,Loved It!,I bought these for my uncle who is obsessed with John Deer and he loves them. They were a great fit for his Ford truck and made from a thick rubber. Hopefully they will last a long time.
5,Excellent,"I very much enjoy the product (The Limeliters) and I appreciate how you handled my order. I would be interested to purchase more disks if available.Best wishes,Eytan Bentsur"
2,Disappointment in Chicago,"Let me first say that I have been a Limeliters fan since they first appeared on the scene in the late 50's. I own every recording I can find of these guys. I recently purchased both ""Chicago Tapes"" with great anticipation. I have to say I was very disappointed. The recording quality is dismal. It sounds like the signal on the master tapes bled through to other layers, and we hear a distorted echo all through both CDs, and the vocals are poorly mixed. Lou Gotleib (rest his soul) sounds as if he did not survive his hippy days in the sixties with all his faculties intact. He rehashes the same old gag lines with limited audience response. If you are a diehard fan (like me), then you may still want these CDs, but don't look for the spark that used to make the Limeliters so exciting. The 1973 recording of Glen and the boys in concert contains most of the same material, and sounds much beter."
3,Dated,"This book is a bit too dated, but is a good foundation for studying femenism related to culture."
2,Why oh Why ?,"When I first put this CD on I thought, well, this is going to be OK, but when track number 2 started I couldn't believe what I am hearing. Is this Anthrax, the band which posted landmarks in the Thrash scene. There are maybe 2-3 good songs on the whole CD and don't get me wrong, I am not a Belladona era freak, actually Bush's vocals are quite good. If you want to hear the real stuff go for Among the Living, this one is just too cheesy, too much MTV orientated.Metal on from Slovenia."
5,Lasts for 2 hours of non-continuous shooting,"This battery has good stamina. I use it with my DCR-HC42 camcorder and it lasts upto 2 hours of non-continuous shooting. By the term ""non-continuous"" shooting I mean the way we use it regularly. For example if you go on a sight seeing trip, you will turn the camcorder on and off regularly to capture good moments. For such use it lasts upto 2 hours which is quite good. You can carry just 2 of these batteries and it will last you for a days sight-seeing trip.These are lithium-ion batteries without memory effect. So you can charge them whenever possible instead of waiting for them to drain down.Overall I am very pleased with these batteries and would definitely recommend them"
5,great,"The battery holds the charge. Everytime I use the camcorder, it comes on. I would recomend this product. This is Great"
5,Worked well. Video recorder working fine again.,This battery worked great and I now have lots of recording time. Old battery would not hold a charge very long and had a very short record time.
3,It's ok,"Holds a charge, but not as long as the original battery on the camcorder. Bought this as a backup battery."
4,Finally found one,We purchased this battery used. The battery is hard to find since they discontinued the sony camcorder. Battery works perfectly
2,"Yup its a battery, but not a good one","If you dont use this battery often, it will be junk in about 10-12 months. Charge last half as long as OEM. Unfortunately we use ours on holiday or trips so it might go 3-6 months without use. You can put it away fully charged only to pull it out 2 months later with 10 minutes or less left till dead. For the price its OK as long as you know this. Its just 1 more thing to put on your maintenance list if you want to get some life out of it."
2,Worked great for about three months,I suppose the batteries do develop a memory. I used the batteries for about three months and suddenly found I had to charge them every single time I wanted to use the camera. There are better aftermarket units available. Do the research.
3,good if you like this sort of thing...,"These concertos are both run of the mill neo romantic concertos, with not much new to say. They are however good examples of neo-Romantic music if you like this style. They are not however inspired and contrary to the other reviewer's opinion, are certainly not better than Barber's essays in the genre, which remain two of the greatest string concertos of the last century. Both concertos lack basic inspiration, unlike the Barber concertos, which glitter with brilliance and lyricism.This is not awful music, its just not exceptional. The pieces are well played and the soloists are both clearly comitted; the recordings are first class. If you can get it cheap in the used and new, and like neo-romantic music, go for it."
2,The Blind Leading the Blind,"This is not an awful album, but if i were in the process of whittling down my CD collection again---this would be one of the first to go. I bought this CD on the merit of one of their other albums and was mostly disappointed. Ringo Starr fans may want to pick this up, if for no other reason than to hear Ringo's son drum on this CD. After that, it will most likely become your favorite beer coaster."
5,Dissonant bliss,"I was looking for a variety of atonal miniatures and I found it on this recording. None of the pieces are cheery, all are mysterious and forlorn sounding. Excellent CD to keep you company on a cold, lonely night camping in the middle of nowhere. TT 68:23"
4,You gotta hear this!,"I was so happy when this CD was reissued. Dolphy is such a charm to listen to with his beautiful combinations of tradition, solid structure, and improvisation. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes some good 60s pop. Especially that song ""Love Me."""
4,Good For Gift-Giving,"I had expected a bit more out of this book. But, for the price, and to give as a gift, it's a good choice."
2,Excellent book for starters in high level synthesis,The book covers topics in high level synthesis very clearly and easy to understand form. The book needs a revision as there has been tremendrous development in this field since 1992.
1,Do Not purchase products from KOSS,I purchased a Koss KS2503 and it lasted about a year. It is a lemon and the company appears to be out of business. There is an electrical problem with this home theater system. I do not understand how this product has not been recalled by the consumer product safety commission. I called customer support and I was told that Koss is going through changes and they could not help me. The only customer service and company number available for Koss Electronics no longer helps its customers. I don't know why there hasn't been a recall. Please stay away from Koss products.
5,A great Valentine's Day present from Michael to his fans,This cd is full of classic love songs done Michael style my two favorites so far are can't buy me love and You and I which is the perfect wedding song. Michael's voice is well suited to all these love songs the background instrumentals are also beautiful. Thanks so much for the wonderful cd Michael!
2,Disappointed Buble,"As much as I like Michael Buble I have to admit that this CD is a stinker (no wonder he had to go on tour to sell it). The magic of Michael is not there it's like the CD was produced to make money, fast. I found it dull, I bought Totally Buble at the same time as this one and find Totally Buble far superior to this one. Lyle Lovett does a better version of Mack the Knife (which is more of a transliteration of the original German than we are used to hearing thanks to Bobby D.)than this CD. Frank Sinatra does a better version of I've Got You Under My Skin than the duplicaiton of the Nelson Riddle/Frank Sinatra arrangement version on this CD. A Foggy Day to me is the CD's only saving grace. The CD is gathering dust in my collection. Michael you can and have done better, your other CD's are full of the verve and warmth of your voice, this one is cold and emotionless. I wish you would have thought this one out a little longer. In the words of Gerturde Stein, ""There is no there, there""."
5,A Great PDA,"I don't normally write reviews, but I had to respond to the criticism of the Clie cover. I've owned several PDAs over the years, and this is the best. The hard plastic flip cover is excellent because I don't need a separate case, but the touch screens and buttons are always protected (in my pocket, brief cases, etc.)."
4,Almost as good as the first season,"For those of you who would like to how the US government FBI) uses ""Implants"" or ""Under Cover Agents"" then this is for you. The reality of citations will definitely get you attention! Although for the most part a fictional program the directors brought to life just how grave an actual ""Terrorist"" event can be.Geno"
3,OK Show but could have been a great show,"I just finished watching Sleeper Cell - American terror and it was OK it had the potential to be a great show, but the story with one of the characters changed everything. I will admit the ending was great, it left you to wonder whats going to happen next. I would have gave this show 5 stars and suggest to everyone to buy the dvd, but I would suggest not buying this dvd because they decided to have a gay character on the show and having that character on the show was pointless, and for everyone who saw the first season and enjoyed every moment when you watch the second season, beware your gonna see some scenes that your not gonna like."
5,Just as described,New and sealed as promised. Also was a great series to watch. I also bought the first season here on Amazon.
4,Carries the torch from the first season,FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed is back to hunting down escaped terrorist Saad Bin Safwaan in more action packed drama. The seaon finale is quite a cliffhanger.
5,once a fighter pilot,"best aviation book i have ever read.. not a book full of technical facts , it is written more about the personnal accounts of a jet-jock, yet it is also written in a manner the average man in the street would have no trouble understanding... put's one right in the cockpit,,,, some great stories..... i would have been quite prepared to pay much more than the $6.00 asked for this book !!!!!!"
4,Decent ladder and usually reasonably priced,"I own two of these green fiberglass ladders, and use them regularly on the job. They are good ladders. The difference between these and the blue version are the yellow plastic braces at the bottoms. The blue ladder has aluminum braces.I would own the yellow or orange, but they are expensive (I really do need them though)."
1,This Ladder is Dangerous!,This ladder is too lightweight to be so tall. It is unstable and the piece of metal that forms the locking cross piece is too high to provide support. Mine bent and collapsed with far less than 200 lbs on i!I am still limping 3 months later.
3,And now for something completely different...,"Overall, a decent album, but a totally different sound than the original Asia. The songs are decnet if you're not out to hear Asia songs. The best songs are ""Arena,"" ""Heaven,"" ""2 Sides of the Moon,"" and Geoff's solo ""Bella Nova."" Get the Anthology first to hear 2 of these tracks and see if you like the sound the new album."
5,A Masterpiece!,"A great album from a great band. Following their great album ""Aria"" this is by far their best album. Great vocals, keyboards, guitars,drums everything. A must buy for all Asia fans"
3,Last of A---A Payne albums,"This could be the last of the Alliterated Asia led albums by Payne starting from Aqua, Aria and Aura. Arena do have some nice songs but not as memorable or distinct as the past three albums particularly Aqua and Aria. Some tracks will just pass by unnoticed and many sound the same. I am sure active listening by the headphones or enhancers may help but still a good album will always stand on its own regardless of assistance. 3 and half stars and for those who wish to complete the A--A or four pillars of Asia by Payne."
4,"A ""new"" Asia that should appeal to older fans, too.","Given the bland, soulless ""Aria"" of 1994, I approached ""Arena"" with some trepidation. It signals another change in direction for this chronically metamorphic band and one which, fortunately, I quickly latched onto. ""Arena"" contains some of my favourite tracks of the decade - from *any* band. What I love is the sheer range and mixture of styles, all perfectly melded into some splendid, original, innovative pieces.There aren't really any weak tracks here but there are clearly some standout pieces: ""Heaven"", ""Two Sides of the Moon"", ""The Day Before the War"", ""U Bring Me Down"" and ""Bella Nova"" being my faves.""Arena"" is certainly a lot different from any of the great 1980s stuff they produced but the sheer strength and innovation behind many of the tracks should capture the hearts of Asia ""veterans"" (of which I am one!)"
4,ASIA IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT!,"Asia goes in a different direction and succeeds! This album has it all, and with the extra track 'That Season' makes this one of the best album by this superb group. John Payne's greatest effort yet and Geoff Downes continues to impress. Still going after 15 years and many different incarnations."
4,Best Asia to date,"Asia may have changed a lot since their early-'80's heyday, but for the better. Geoff Downes reminds us why he was the best keyboardist Yes has ever had with his great work here. Payne is the vocalist again, and while some fans can't accept him as a replacement for John Wetton, to my ears he's probably better. The songs are all good prog-rock epics delivered superbly by all concerned. A must- have for fans of progressive rock music."
4,A Better Asia quality album of of the post Wetton era.,"This Album is truly better musically , than the past two Asia albums of Aria , and Aqua . Its a great rock progressive album . Geoff Downes is great as usual on his keyboards . John Payne definetly sounds better than the previous two albums , and the lyrics and music are more serious and thought out than Aqua , and especially Aria . The songs ,Arena , Heaven, and Words, as well as Two sides of the moon sound great . I highly recommend this album ."
3,Asia's Most Different Album,"This is probably the only Asia album I haven't listened to that often. It's not bad, just not real interesting. They decided to go in a more progressive direction on this album compared to ""Aria."" The percussion is interesting on ""Into the Arena."" Overall a great instrumental. ""Turn it Around"" is probably my favorite song. Great intro on that. ""Bella Nova"" is another great instrumental from Geoff Downes. He's the main reason I like Asia. He's the best. Different from the other albums, but still worth a listen."
4,Trigun Messenger Bag,"Not exactly big enough to use as a backpack for high school, but it was in perfect condition. It's something I use regularly. It's durable and unique."
3,Rough Writing About the Wild West,"The two previous reviewers have hit the mark. Myers, way too often, stretches for an archaic or obscure word or phrase that stops the reader and obscures meaning. It's clever but highly mannered writing that goes too far, attracting too much (unfavorable) attention to itself, forcing the reader to become a translator rather than an viewer of a scene or listener to a story. Yet the solid substance here, the product of serious reasearch, makes the pain worthwhile."
3,Try local dollar store first,"I was looking for this item for quite a while and was happy to find it on Amazon. It is the old-fashioned towel rack, and now-a-days, you can only find towel racks that attach over a cabinet door. So I was very happy to pay $4.95 plus $5 shipping--until yesterday! I was at the local dollar store and found the exact same item - for $1. So I am suggesting to future buyers, check local dollar stores first."
2,Doesn't last very long,"Works well, mechanically, but the white coating on the arms of the rack began to crack and fall off within a year."
1,Will the real FiggKidd please stand up?,"Figgkidd is posing as the Australian Eminem. Whether he be ripping the mic up in an un-authentic accent or taking on multiple roles in his videoclips, Figgkidd is always in some shape of form following in Em's footsteps. Your 7 years late mate. Will the real FiggKidd please stand up? One of Figg's songs even mentions the musically artistic Eminem. In the song My Oh My, he is quoted saying ""My Oh My, Figgkidd's gone crazy - No Angel, But No Slim Shady"". This lyric written by Figg himself proves two things. That Figg's grammar isnt top notch and that he plans on following in Eminem's footsteps. So Figginem, or is it Emikidd? Please stand up, lose the accent and show us what OzHipHop is all about. - Your friend, Dee-enay :)"
4,Useful for any author,"I just finished my first novel, but I didn't have a clue on how to get people to buy it. Thank God for Harry! Harry works at my local bookstore and told me about 1001 Ways to Market Your Books. I already had Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, and I was using it create some 'buzz.' Now, I can proceed forward with confidence, thanks both to Harry and Mr. Kremer."
5,Incredible Book,"I purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book. Without Mr. Kremer's Book I would have been clueless, however now I am well informed and continue to sell my book. It has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher, which was my main goal. ( I self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling)I knew the world needed my book and I needed it releasedquick. Mission accomplished. I keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as I continue my publishing journey. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"John Kremer's web site is very informative, so I expected more from this book. (I also purchased a CD containing numerous short articles that was extremely disappointing)The problem with this book is that it tries to tell you so much that it doesn't tell you enough. Kremer seems to want to overwhelm you with ideas, many of which are marginal at best (e.g. skywriting as a marketing tool)and the result is a confusing mishmash of half-baked ideas. Much of the text is regurgitation of very basic marketing principles you can glean from any marketing text. The book seemed poorly organized and fragmented. Kremer apparently sold ""ads"" in his book disguised as short ""informational"" articles by people trying to sell various products and services to book publishers. I found these extremely annoying, especially when found in a book that is priced 50% higher than other (better) books on the same subject."
2,Disappointing,"After reading positive review after positive review of the book, I eagerly anticipated the book's arrival in the mail. As the book was so thick and chock full of information, I knew that I would walk away with many new ideas on how to market my book. After reading the book cover to cover, I can honestly say that I walked away with very little. Perhaps it is because I have a background in marketing and already came up with some of the marketing ideas on my own (get mentioned in newspaper articles, speak in as many places as possible) or perhaps because some of the ideas were just a stretch to 1,001 (Open your own bookstore, use your book content to start a book and get AdSense money."
4,"Getting dated, but still a great resource","A new edition of this book would probably warrant five stars, but the high price tag and outdated information in some sections may put some readers off. This is still a volume that any serious book marketer will want to have and just a few good ideas will make the item pay for itself.On the downside, most of the Internet information is pretty useless at this point (from 1998) and many of the book buying statistics were last true a decade ago.Realize that this does not contain pixie dust that will instantly make your book a best seller. Most of the recommendations require effort, salesmanship, and perserverence. If you're willing to actually implement what he suggests, however, you'll find enough to keep yourself busy for years.Tim Leffelauthor, The World's Cheapest Destinations"
5,"So many ideas, so little time","Jam-packed with ideas to help you market your book. Writing amazon reviews is one of them!Author, ""Trust is Everything: Become the leader others will follow"""
3,it's OK,"This is a very large book with a lot of information. In truth, it seemed that some of the ideas, installing a toll free number, selling to schools and libraries, and selling subsidiary rights, seemed beyond the ability of a single author trying to sell a book. I think the book, though advertised ""for authors and publishers"" has a lot of information for publishers only. And, of course, publishers have their own publicity people. So, I give it a C+ or maybe a B-. Lots of information, not all of it helpful."
3,Honestly...,"I've had this book for nearly a year now, maybe more, and I've honestly got to say that I haven't used it once. It seems like so much work compared to the tactics I found in ""Plug Your Book! Online Book Marketing for Authors, Book Publicity through Social Networking"" by Steve Weber. Why do foot work and reach thousands, when I can do finger work and reach millions?! ...I did spend money to buy this book though... Maybe after I exhause all options in ""Plug Your Book!,"" and I still want to reach a few more people, I try some of 1001's suggestions."
3,[...],There were a lot of ideas in this book. The most important advice that the author gave is to refer me to Dottie for public relations. She's in the process of creating a campaign for me to promote my book. I'm pretty sure you'll find something in his book that you can use.
1,A Farse,"Quick fix marketing tips never last. 10 minute a day marketing is like telling a fat women to workout 10 minutes a day and look like Cheryl Tiegs in the 1980s. It is a farse and you shouldn't buy into such objectivism. The cold reality of the situation is that over 30,000+ books are produced a week in publishing. Of course, only about 5% are actually quality books, but still the numbers are staggering. There are no quick fix lottos. The successful author is realistic and makes contacts, networks, and his tool is the grindstone. Some doors may open, most will close. This is nothing but a car salesman's handbook and I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
1,In depth and very useful,"The book is written from the perspective of the publisher but if you happen to have your books published by a small publishing company (pod, or self-published) you will gobble any amount of help. The other great thing is that you can contact John Kremer in person and he seems to be the expert's expert.You want your book to be a bestseller? You need a little encouraging? From personal experience, pennyless and at the disposition of others, authors get a kick out of any kind of contacts. If you're brave enough and if you want it enough, Kremer says, and spend 10 min a day marketing, you'll get there (eventually).1001 Ways is a very helpful (big) book and there should be something for everybody's who's interested in the ridiculously complicated field of writing."
5,Entertaining read,I enjoyed reading this one. I'm impressed that something written so long ago doesn't seem dated. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
1,Not stainless steel,"As another reviewer has mentioned, these are most definitely not stainless steel. They are a chrome-plated alloy and the plating had already started to chip when delivered. I'm rarely disappointed by well-reviewed products on Amazon, but the strong rating on this is a miss."
2,Magnet sticks to skewers,"The first thing I did when I got the skewers was to see if my small refrigerator magnet sticks to them. It does, quite strongly. Let's just hope that if I wash them and keep them dry they won't rust. Well, at least they are shiny. . . . for now . . ."
5,Good Sturdy SS Skewers,"I was afraid these skewers might be flimsy, or not hold onto meat and veggies well, but there's nothing to worry about... the stainless steel is good quality, I've had not problems with rust or bending. They have a flattened oval shape to hold your food, making rotating easy. Good product, amazing price, a must buy!"
5,what a spike!,"good product, super quick shipping, great price. very pleased with purchase, even though i haven't used them yet! throwing those wooden skewers away"
2,not a good CD to learn spanish,"The item shipped fine and very timely, but the disc itself is not conducive to learning the language. basically it is a guy who says an english word and repeat it in Spanish...not enough to repetition to learn."
1,Learn Spanish in your car: The beginner's spanish course for the car.,This was a terrible CD. Not for anyone close to a beginner. It was spoken too fast to be able to be understood and too fast to repeat. It also contained some of the most inane things one might think of learning as a beginner. I played it once and never again.
5,The kids at school loved this book!,"The combination of adventure and educational material in this book made it a great hit with my daughter and her friends, as well as the moms and teachers. The story follows a boy on an expedition to study the paths of some endangered tigers. We love the photo/drawing combination and the extra tidbits of info on the sidebars. A friend borrowed the book for her 6th grade class, and they loved it, too - I would extend the recommended ages to at least 4-12. (I'd guess it's a 3rd grade reading level). We can't wait for the series to be extended to more adventures of Riley."
5,Delightful reading,"This is one of 3 books written and they are great reading, very informative, and spiritually excellent. You won't be sorry you took the time to read it."
3,Deano Rocks,Did Dean Martin ever make a bad album? This is one of those wonders of the technology revolution in taking two albums originally released on vinyl and transferring them to CD. The production is excellent and the songs will take you back to the fifties and sixties if you can remember that far back. Thanks Dean.
4,YOU'LL BE SURPRISED,"I BOUGHT IT JUST FOR THE SONG WITH TOO SHORT, BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE THIRD OR FOURTH BEST SONG. THIS ALBUM IS DEFINITELY WORTH 12 BUCKS. UNFORTUNATELY, PEOPLE WILL SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM, BUT IT'S TOO BAD, BECAUSE IT'S OFF THE HEEZZEEE"
5,Warrior Within is worth exploring for Martial Arts Mastery!,"I saw ""The Warrior Within"", a tribute to Bruce Lee and other inspired Martial Arts masters, and I enjoyed it. It displays the art of several martial arts talents and their self defense philosophy which helps them to prevent them from becoming victimized in a world where violence must sometimes be diffused by violence; the Art self defense! Practitioners give their own account of how Martial Arts training is important to them, and why it is still a part of their lives. Even Robert Lee, brother of the late Bruce Lee, contributes a smooth song as a theme for this documentary. For Males as well as Females, the Warrior Within is an example of why Self Defense is still an important part of life, and why it's mastery is worth exploring for young, and old alike. A truly memorable film!"
5,An Underrated Classic,"This book was my very first Favourite Book and helped turn me into the voracious reader I am today. I got it when I was 8 and quite literally read the covers off it. It gives the young reader an introduction to several concepts like the tinkering inventor and the secret spy organisation and their foes. It's a real boy's-own adventure, and deserves its audience. A great present for a youngster you want to encourage into the reading habit.Thank you Mr Sobol, we owe you one."
5,art of the groove,I am a high school violinist that got to be part of a master class with this group and they were amazing! I could listen to them for hours.
2,To simple,"To simple, they dont look elegant at all, and to make them a little pretty you really have to have them profesionally printed and there goes your money, I'm really thinking of buying new invitations. the really dont look like the ones in the picture. But hey they could have been worst..."
3,Expensive,these were very elegant although I felt they were a bit over-priced as I found them at Michials for about 20 dollars less
4,SUPER VOICE< GOOD CD,"I am a fan of Steve Tyrell and his stuff is always good. His voice is wonderful. The CD is good, not great, I listen to others more often. I recommend the CD but others by Tyrell are better."
4,Steve Tyrell,I love this man's throaty singing. My first CD of his 'standards' was great.This one - well it's not the CD - it's me - some of the songs weren't to my liking.
2,This Guys In Love,"Well....it's a difference of opinion that makes horse racing. Contrary to the rave reviews this long awaited Steve Tyrell CD is receiving, to this trained ear it falls far short of his earlier works. On some of the tracks, it sounds like he's imitating his earlier self."
5,Great Taste,"I love the choices of tunes. ""Manhattan"",""Nevertheless"" and ""That's All"" are not over exposed standards. Rod Stewart's efforts pale in comparison to all of Steve's albums. I'm happy the Holiday's are here so I can listen to ""New Year's Eve"" on the Christmas album. If you get a chance to see him live...don't miss it."
3,listenable pop,"There's nothing really wrong with this, but don't let these gushing reviews fool you into thinking that Tyrell's music is more than pleasant easy listening fare. Sinatra, he's not."
1,This Guy in my opinion is TERRIBLE in concert,"I have many of Steve Tyrell's CD and have enjoyed them. I jumped at the chance to see him in concert at the Golden Nugget in Vegas this past weekend. We had front row, center stage tickets. And that's when the fantasy ended for me. He reads the lyrics off of a computer screen set in front of him as if we were at some karaoke show!! Then I went to meet him and because I didn't buy his $25 CD he brushed me off and asked if anyone had cd's for him to sign. It was so desperate, I felt sorry for him. In my opinion, I wish I never went because now the songs will never sound the same."
3,Good but not great,I was not impressed with this album. A few songs were good but as a whole it is alot of covers.
4,Very Good of late Mercian History,"I was impressed by this book in its detail regarding the muddy middle history of the kingdom of Mercia as it was eventually joined with the other Heptarchy in forming England. Mr. Walker writes in a style that makes this dim past come alive. I would have rated this book higher had he spent a little more time laying the ground work for the 8th and 9th centuries by discussing the 6th and 7th Centuries. Particularly the contributions of Penda, Peada, Wulfhere etc. to the increasing power of Mercia as an economic and social power. Michael Woods ""In Search of the Dark Ages"" would make a nice companion book to this one."
4,Was really good - glad I read it.,I truly enjoyed this book. I felt that I really got to know and care about the characters. I read it in one afternoon. I will tell you that I started skimming parts towards the end. The dilemmas just kept going on and on and on. She ran away just one time too many for me. But other than that (not a deal breaker as I know when to start skipping sections) I truly enjoyed this book! I would recommend you read it! Now on to the next one. Cheers.
4,"Friendly, fun characters and an interesting plot.","Almost all of the books I've read by Johanna Lindsey I've liked but of course there are exceptions to every rule. This one is on my top ten list though. I liked the characters because both the hero and the heroine were stubburn but they were people I could relate to. I find that a lot in her books. I felt the plot was interesting because it took you to more than one setting and described some of them. This made the book even more special. I rate it an 8 because though it's on my list there were some parts I didn't like. Including how Tanya was treated by her ""father."""
4,Excellent Shelf-Life,"This book is definitely a four star romance...I loved the plot & the characters, and had a marvelous time reading the book. The heroine, Tanya (Tatiana), was found and brought up in a saloon in frontier America that she hopes to one day inherit. Fate, though, has other plans.Stephen, the hero, comes to America looking for the fostered off princess he is supposed to marry. What he finds instead is a skeptical barmaid loathe to leave her station.Typical Lindsey plot insues...heroine dislikes hero and gives good chase. Unfortunately (or fortunately), all ten escape attempts fail. You can't help but wonder why they run at all!No matter, all Linsey fans will get their money's worth as this book has an excellent shelf-life!"
1,Avoid this one!,"An unenjoyable book. The main characters were constantly fighting, arguing, misunderstanding and misinterpreting each other's words and actions. The heroine was particularly annoying, and by the end of the book (if you can make it that far) you feel no empathy or affection towards her. Definitely not a keeper."
2,Not a favourite,"This is not one of Johanna Lindsey's best, in fact it is one of about 3 that I have been disappointed in. I didn't think that there was much of a story to it, and found it very hard to read. I found Tanya to be a bit too obnoxious. The sequel 'You Belong to Me', which is about Stefans'cousin Vasili is much better."
2,A Little Aggravating,"I don't mean to offend anyone who loved this book (a lot of people dislike my Lindsey fave--Prisoner of My Desire), but it annoyed me to no end. The entire time I was reading it I was screaming at Tanya. I kept wondering when she was going to stop being so stubborn and nasty and I kept thinking: ""God, if she runs away AGAIN!..."" I like Stefan though, and how his close friends/cousin were in most of the novel."
5,Once a Princess,Once a Princess . Love this book I am a big Johanna Lindsey fan . I have all her books
3,"It was okay for me. Not her best, not her worst. I will read more from her though. Thank you.","It was okay for me. Not her best, not her worst. I will read more from her though. Thank you."
4,not to be put down even if you're dying to sleep,"one of the best ever written by J.L. It makes you believe in love, fate, and fairy tales complete with a prince and princess over and over again. It transports you to that certain period of time--I wish I was there!"
4,I wish I was a lost princess!,This was a very enjoyable read. But I gave this book a 4 and not a 5 because of a few reasons1. The misunderstandings were a bit much...there were times when I was wondering when it was all over. The characters seem to think that it is best to keep information from each other. The author over did it just a bit. However i was not dissatisfied. I was quite excited when I got to the part where everything is revealed and all the misunderstandings are cleared up.2. The ending was too abrupt. I wanted more of a fight and suspense between the characters. I was expecting Tanya to face more danger and have Stefan fight for her life...like any knight rescuing his princess. Only a few threats and punches were thrown....kind of disappointing.Overall I did enjoy the book and did not want to stop reading. I just wished the author would have written more for the ending.
4,Engaging & fun!,"Although not my MOST favorite of Lindsay's books, it was definitely worth staying up to read. I really enjoyed the characters & found it to be a lot of fun. I enjoyed the chemistry of the characters & would not mind a follow-up novel!"
4,Fairy Tales Do Come True!!!!,"At least for Tatiana Janacek they do. A wonderful book! A beautiful, feisty, and skeptical heroine; A handsome, and frustrated hero; what more could you ask for? This book shows Lindsey at her best, funny, poignant, sexy, romantic, with a dash of adventure thrown in for good measure. After this I reccomend reading Vasili's story ""You Belong To Me"". I also hope that we get Lazar's and Serge's stories too."
1,Stupidity in large doses.,"I have read a lot of Johanna Lindsey and was sorely disappointed with this one. I had no love for the characters, no interest in the story after her second escape attempt, and no respect for the unrealistic self esteem issues of a KING for goodness sake! If the main female could have been honest about ANYTHING even ONCE through the course of this ridiculousness I might have cared even a little if she lived or died, much less got her HEA... which I'm still fairly sure she didn't deserve. The ""twist"" at the end was so stupid I rolled my eyes so hard I HEARD it! I feel it could have been enjoyable if I had a higher tolerance for stupid people, but I do not, so it wasn't."
2,'Overboard',"The basic theme of ""Once a Princess"" is good; but the author ruined it with a heavy emphasis on sex. I quickly lost interest and sent it back. If this is the best that Ms. Lindsey can do, maybe she should try doing something else. I am sure there must be a GOOD book inside her if she will just look for it."
4,a fave of mine from back in the day,"While not as riveting as the first time I read it years ago, Johanna is a classic when it comes to writing historicals."
4,Wishing for sequels!,"I really enjoyed both books and read each several times because it left me wanting more. I wish she will write a sequel for the Great, Handsome King Stefan and the SO Very Handsome Vasili and their wives. All are some of my most favorite charactors she has ever written about and all very strong. Then write about their beautiful Children and don't forget Lazar and Serge. If someone know how to writ to Ms. Lindsey, please ask her to write seques to Cardinia."
5,A World Premire Recording Of A Lost 20th Century Masterpiece,"The Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos was undoubtedly one of the 20th century's greatest composers, and yet even now he is only known internationally for his admittedly excellent ""Bachianas Brasilieras."" Conductor Gisele Ben-Dor and her excellent Santa Barbara Symphony went out of their way expand peoples' knowledge of the composer by making this world-premiere recording of his Symphony No. 10 of 1957, known as the ""Amerindia."" The results are splendid--a work that combines 20th century orchestral color and texts from Latin, Portugese, and South American Indian sources into a memorable collage. Both Ben-Dor and her orchestra are at their top-notch best in this recording, as are vocal soloists Carla Wood, Carlo Sciabelli, and Nmon Ford-Livene, and the choral forces from the Santa Barbara area. Vigorously recommended for contemporary classical fans!"
5,Educational & Enjoyable,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves watching it, and usually requests that I play it over and over until it is his bedtime. This film has quality animation, and offers an excellent learning experience. I think that they took the right approach when they created this film. My wife and I have purchased a lot of Leap Frog products, and I have yet to be disappointed by any of them; and neither has my 2 year old. We've also bought the alphabet version of this series too. I'd recommend this for any young child. Watching this over and over allows them entertainment and a great basic education. They repeat the numbers over and over and give my son a chance to keep up and realize what's going on at all times."
5,Awesome!!,"I have never not liked anything made by leapfrog. My son learned to count, recognize numbers, recognized letters and there sounds by age 2 with leapfrog!!! They are entertaining and educational!!!"
2,Effective but annoying,"My kids LOVE leapfrog videos and we have many of them. Letter Factory, Talking Words, Math Adventure to the Moon, and some othes. They've done a great job teaching phonics and numbers. This one does teach numbers and number counting concepts well. However, the music is grating. I'm surprised only one other reviewer mentioned it. I can't handle hearing it so they don't watch this one anymore."
5,My 15 months old love it,My little one love Violet and when I got her this dvds from leapfrog she was so excited to see violet on TV. I wanted to introduce her to numbers and this dvd do a good job at it for number 1 to 10.
2,Painful on the ears,"Okay, the Leapfrog letter factory was awesome. This one literally hurt my head to listen to - and I was in the kitchen. I guess my 2 year old liked it but it didn't hold his attention as much."
5,Love the leapfrog series!,"I needed something to keep my 22 month old busy while I packed for a move, and after reading so much about how great Letter Factory was for learning letters and sounds, I searched Netflix for any leapfrog videos. Numberland was one of four that were available. Well, like others have said, my son wanted me to play this (and The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park) over and over. Within a couple weeks, my son knew numbers 1-10 (and all his letters from The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park), and was calling them out where ever we were. He still asks to watch it a few times a week, and its one of the very few things that I don't mind him watching. I highly recommend this video."
4,Similar & Comparable to the Pamper Chef shaker,"If you have ever had or used the Pampered Chef shaker you could say this product is very similar but without the added bonus of the clear plastic cover that Pampered Chef includes with their product.This product is a ""Must Have"" for any home baker, decorator or breakfast gadget guru. It's great, easy and convenient for medium and smaller jobs. Great for powder sugar, colored sugar, cinnamon & sugar mixtures. I have used small and large sifters for baking. Hands down, this is my preferred sifter. My kitchen would not be complete with at least three of these shakers.Five stars if it would have came with a clear cover."
3,It's OK,"This is much, much smaller than I expected when I saw that it included ""flour"" shaker in the product name. As a SUGAR shaker, like for sprinkling powdered sugar on French toast or something, it is the perfect size. However, I bought it to use as a FLOUR shaker, and for that it seems on the small side. I am used to the big coffee-can sized flour sifter, and this is more along the lines of a soup can so....just keep that in mind when ordering and you won't be disappointed."
4,Smaller in reality,It looks a lot bigger in the picture than in real life. The plastic is not as well constructed. A little cheap looking plastic. It will serve the purpose for powder sugar shaker. I should check the size instead of judging by the picture.
3,"Really, really small","And looks like it might rust pretty fast. I'm sure it will do the job for more, but on first glance it looks like something worth a couple of dollars"
2,Cheaply made?,It seems pretty cheaply made. It's not much different than my in hand strainer. I wish there was a lid for it too so I could store my powdered sugar in it.
4,Nice item,I put cinnamon and sugar in it. I love it! I want another for salt and pepper. I also gave as a gift and they love it too.
4,Does the trick!,"I bought this for my daughter and it works well, it's a little lighter weight than I was expecting, but I was comparing it to ones I have from Pampered Chef. It would also be nice if it had a cover - but it's a good deal for the price."
1,Flour shaker,"I was very disappointed I thought it should have a covered lid . My other flour shaker had a lid keeps bugs,flies,dust . Off the flour"
2,Yuk!,"If you like really badly acted horror films this one is for you! The film is a curiosity: wonderful crisp, black & white cinematography wasted on a pointless plot, incredibly bad makeup: rubber wigs seams abound, even a misspelled title card, but if you long for the kind of bad movie-making from the Toxic Avenger school of cinema, you came to the right place. Acne makes the original Night of the Living Dead look like a Masterpiece Theater production in comparison."
3,"Alan Quartermain & the Lost City of Gold, Creative Titling?","I am a serious Haggard fan. Of his 50+ novels I own all but 12, including many first editions. Of the ones I do not own, I have read all but two. Sir Henry Rider Haggard wrote Allan Quartermain in 1887 following his successful King Solomon's Mines in 1885, and She in 1886. No one ever heard of Alan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold until that ridiculous Richard Chamberlain movie was released. I personally will not support a publisher that takes liberties with titles of classic lost world fiction, and suggest that if you wish to read Alan Quartermain, check out some of the reputable used book sites."
2,Poorly assembled,"I can't say much about the story - I've only made it to Chapter 4. However, around about Chapter 2, the pages started falling out of the book. Not well assembled."
2,Wrong title,"Haggard's novel is called ""Allan QUATERMAIN"". It even says that on the cover photograph of the book.Not ""Quartermain.""You can't tell a book by its cover? Well..."
5,It does what it is supposed to do.,"Not much to say about this product. It does what it is supposed to do. There are only 12 markers, but I knew that when I bought it so I'm not going to take a star away for that."
1,Only 12 Markers Not 24,"Are you kidding? Only received 12 markers for over $5, and they are quarter sized. that means I paid over 40 cents each, next time I'll use quarters to mark my ball, or better yet dimes, which are thinner and one fourth the price. Worst purchase I have made in years."
2,Noise Maker,"This cheap imitation of an HP power supply functions just fine. Just don't try to watch TV using an indoor antenna within 50' of it while it's plugged in. The adapter is apparently not properly shielded & puts out impressive amounts of RF interference. It doesn't have a right angle plug like the picture shows, either. Spend the extra money & get a real HP."
3,"Item not correct, good service.","This product did not fit into my HP zv5000. However, once I contacted their customer service they did an outstanding job of refunding my purchase. Thanks!"
5,Sizing info explained,"The two multi packs are not clear which size bags you get. The amazon description is the same.The SMALL MULTIPACK has the following sizes. 5x4.75"", 4.4x7.25"", 6.5x6"", and 8.75x6"".The LARGE MULTIPACK is as follows 4.4x7.25"", 6.5x6"", 8.75x6"", and 12x12.5"".These are all outer dimensions. Inner dimensions seem to be 1/4-3/4"" smaller depending on long side versus short side, size accordingly. The First measurement is usually a 1/4"" smaller and the second quoted dimension is usually 3/4"" smaller. For example the 5x4.75"" bag is internally 4.75x4"". Hope this helps."
4,Not for sharp edged batteries inside checked in luggages,"When placing Aloksak inside your checked in luggages (where your luggage get's squeshed pretty hard) avoid putting rectangular metal objects like a spare battery (PDA, Cell Phones) as the edges of these objects would cause pin holes - this happened to me but the seller sent me a replacement. So 4 star for excellent customer service."
2,Not Durable!,I ordered a three pack of the 9X6 and 5X7 in August 2012. One of each in use since August have failed where the fasten strip has separated from the bags (inside). I expect better for the price you pay for these Talked to support and they suggested that they replace on defect and not wear and tear. I used the small one for a phone opening on a regular basis and the larger for a camera used seldom on hikes when raining. I could pursue a replacement for defect. I guess I will write this off as a poor purchase.
3,Worked Great for One Trip,"They work as advertised but are definitely not durable for long term use over for being tossed into a backpack. They bags are easily dammaged handled properly and are not a long term storage solution. For the short term they kept all of out maps, passports, camera, and phones dry for the trip."
4,Seems to do the trick,I just bought these for long term storage so I doubt they will truly be tested. They seal tight I thought the plastic would be a little thicker but its not bad. The only bad thing I could see that the seams could come apart if you mistreat it. Overall I would say it's worth the money. Plus they are made in America so that's a bonus.
2,Not useful at high temps,"Airtight - yes.Durable - yes.Dirt/sand proof - yes.Fuses (i.e., insides stick together and are inseparable at temp 100 F and above and cannot be separated) - yes.Problem is - these bags will fuse at higher (though not uncommon temps). If you're using this for storage of valuables/electronics beware as you may put in luggage, luggage sits on the tarmac (i.e., at over 100 F) and all your stuff will no longer be bagged, but shrink wrapped! You'll have fun peeling / cutting off your stuff.Good news - even though the bags were ruined - all equipment stayed dry."
4,Slightly better than a ziploc bag.,"These bags have the old style ""press and close"" locking system. It is quite easy to make sure they're closed as there are obviously wrinkles in the closure when it's not closed.If it weren't for the material, I would say these weren't any better than ziploc.However, the material on these bags is slicker and less porous than Ziploc so they don't seem to get as dingy. It is not, however, any thicker than ziploc."
4,Great option,These are nice and I ordered a variety pack. I only used the one size so far but if the rest are the same this is a great buy for many uses.
3,Not really waterproof or smell proof but still good product.,"These guys bags are not as waterproof, smell proof or durable as they claim. I would not trust them with anything important ins tide to 10 feet, much less 200. Still a good product though. Basically ZIP LOC bags on steroids. Defiantly not smell proof. I can smell food inside the bag when it is tightly sealed and the dog defiantly can. Have not tried it with bears yet but i have a pretty good idea of the outcome if i did."
2,barely not a ziplock bag,"I ordered these since i wanted various size water tight bags for various gear and come to find that they barley qualify for a little more than ziplock bags from a super market.granted, they are a bit thicker than a super market ziplock bag, but i wouldn't trust them either. i am going to stick to the sealine cases which are not only water tight but also waaaaaay thicker plastic and are far more durable.[...]"
1,Don't use it for your Kindle!,"I bought these bags all excited that I could read my Kindle without having to worry about getting it wet in the Hot Tub or on the beach. No such luck! The bag recommended for the Kindle is the 9""x6"". These are outside measurements as it turns out. You can put the Kindle in, but you will never get it closed. Very disappointing! So for now I am back to using the Ziploc baggies!!!Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
1,Don't buy a 6x9 aLoksak for your Kindle2!,"I bought these directly from the Loksak website where they even have a note saying ""NEW! Recommended on the Amazon blog to protect the Kindle reading device."" Apparently not the 6x9. The INSIDE width of the 6x9 bag is only 5.25 inches; there's a 3/4 inch edge outside the zipper. The 5 3/8 Kindle 2 won't fit. When I emailed the customer service department saying I thought the product is misrepresented I got a rather terse reply saying it was my fault I had ordered the wrong size. I called to speak to the CS supervisor who got quite nasty with me. I paid just under $6.00 for shipping, and unless I pay to ship them back I'm out of luck. Not at all a pleasant company to deal with."
4,can't wait to use them on my next kayaking trip!,i purchased these waterproof bags based on the amazon reviews and also after seeing them at a local sporting goods store. i tested them as advised on the package and they work (in the sink..)! they appear durable and well constructed. the only drawback was that the size of each bag was not listed in the ad. i also am interested in the large collection but would like to know beforehand the dimensions of each.....
4,Does its Job Well,"Does its job. Keeps stuff dry. Little pricey, but worth it, depending on how valuable the item in the bag is. I'll buy more when needed."
4,Really useful,Bought it before my cruise trip and found it really useful throughout the trip. Fully water proof. I highly recommend.
3,"Fine for what it is, but won't hold a Kindle Paperwhite","I got the Multi-pack Small version of this product, hoping that I would get a more durable replacement for the Ziploc sandwich bag I've been keeping my Kindle Paperwhite in (it fits perfectly, but the bag tends to get nicked up). These bags are a bit more durable, but unfortunately there are two which are much too small, one which is just a tiny bit too small, and one which is much too big. The search for a durable, waterproof holder for the Paperwhite continues."
5,Excellent,"Thgse bags are just as great at all the internets say. I've used the big one to cover my kPad while I'm in the POOL, and the smaller ones to keep liquids from escaping during travel."
2,Think Ziplock,"These bags were not what I was hoping for and they have two features you should be aware of:1) They are smaller than you think. I bought the 4x5 thinking I could store my 4.5 inch iPhone in one - it will not fit without bursting the seams.2) They are not ""thick"" plastic. They are one step up from a freezer Ziplock bag.I'm sure they are waterproof but they will not last much more than a Ziplock, maybe one backpacking trip as long as you put soft and rounded and small objects inside them."
1,bad vitamins,"Our son has a metabolic disorder that is helped by taking biotin. These capsules were very small compared to other brands of 5 mg biotin capsules we'd purchased. After a few weeks on these, my son became symptomatic again. We switched him to GNC brand 5 mg capsules and he stabilized. It is my opinion that these capsules did not contain a full 5 mg of biotin or that they did not contain biotin at all. The FDA really doesn't regulate vitamins well, so those of you taking them for medical reasons should find a reliable manufacturer. Country Life is not reliable. I wanted to give this product zero stars, but the application would not let me do that--so consider my rating zero stars."
4,Decent for the price,"I wanted to start taking supplements to help thicken my hair-it's really bad!-and strengthen my nails. For me, this product works. It isn't like magic where the next morning my hair was akin to Rapunzel and my nails were beginning to curl they were so long. It has taken time to get there, and I am much happier waiting for the good results than speedily trying to slap a bandaid on my issues. It's just like losing weight: the faster you lose it, the easier it is for you to gain it back and the slower you take, the less likely you will gain it back. Is it perfect? No, but my nails begin to bend and chip when I stop taking it and my hair falls out much, much more. I am glad the FDA doesn't control yet another thing in my life. Just because the FDA approves something doesn't make it good for you.Also, I am vegetarian. When you have ""dietary issues"" it is sooooo much harder to find something you CAN take. Thank you, Country Life, for making a product that works and is affordable."
1,Breakout,"These were over expensive and broke me out soooo badly omg. took 3 years to clear the spots. If you are looking for vitamnins for hair and skin, I say get Country Life Maxi Hair, they are much better. Not these ACNE pills. Ugh"
5,A verry special book by a very special lady,"Many years ago, I had the good fortune to know Esther Rothman personally. You couldn't ask for a more sensitive and intuitive educational leader and person. As principal of her school, she extended herself to individual students on a regular basis and often broke through proverbial ""brick walls"" in her work--not only administratively but on the student level. One idea in her book served me well throughout my career as a teacher and administrator. The concept was that of giving students choices. By giving two options--both of which are acceptable to you, the teacher--the student exerts his/her own power of decision making. The strategy is so positive and it works! The book is well worth reading. I have my well used copy on my bookshelf where it occupies a position of honor."
5,A book I used for my Introduction to Education class,"Thirty years ago when I was teaching education classes, I required my beginning students to read this book before entering the classroom to observe. They thought it strange at first because it involved stories of so many that had been disruptive in the classroom. But when they came back from observation, the consensus was that all it takes is one student to distract from the educational process. They were extrememly thankful for the skills and insight this book provided.Ann L. Allman, Ed.D."
2,Benny Goodman,"Most of the studio recordings sounded almost like 1970's re-creations, not free, loose sessions. The live concert sessions were much more lively. But the worst thing was that the ""Sing Sing Sing"" track ended before the great strong, loud band and rapid drum ending. It just softly faded out to nothing many bars before the famous ending."
3,it all depends on you,I liked this book and for most authors the advice here is right on the mark but I also know several people who self published and are doing just fine. I know other people who self published and were picked up by big publishers a year or two later. These people all dedicated themselves totally to making their books a success. If you don't have that type of drive then self publishing will not be the answer for you. Your only option is to go for the mainstream.This book should be carefully studied by all new writers. It's honest and may save you money and grief.
1,only one tune worth having,"I bought this CD because I LOVED ""tonight in my dreams""against the advice of a friend of mine I bought the CD.Didn't like ANY of the other tunes."
3,"Too Much Demand, Not Enough Material","By 1966, Dean's TV show was in full swing, and the demand for his albums was H-O-T! To try and meet the demand, Reprise records tried to mix and match new Dean Martin tracks, with tracks from his more obscure country albums, in order to fill out and *sell* more albums. Somewhere there's a Someone.. is pure cashbox. Aside from the title song and That Old Clock On the Wall, there's nothing new here. A Million and One has some new C&W flavored material in a late 60's country vein.. but manages to retread a few earlier tracks as well. Frankly I'd get Happiness Is & Welcome To My World."
4,The Global Warming Emperor Has no Clothes!,"A concise and very readable expose of the most recent scams perpetrated on the public by the professional scaremongers. The graph of the Vostok ice-core derived temperatures is especially revealing. Even more revealing is the cliche-filled review below by the poseur scientist wannabe from the Netherlands. He demonstrates clearly the self-serving condenscension that Mathiesen writes about. No honest scientist would demonstrate such bias. The scientific community is not certain that warming is anthropocentric. I know that for certain from atmospheric scientists with whom I am acquainted.I only give the book four stars because it delves too much into other environmental scams (after all the title is ""Global Warming..."") but the information is interesting and useful. The book is well worth reading even if you have read similar books as this is the most recent."
1,"Long on assertion, short on substantiating proof","I'm not one of the idiotic anti-American leftists several reviewers throw into this discussion (relevance??). I've read most of the lay literature on both sides trying to figure out what is going on. This book provides very little to aid in my efforts. If you read it carefully, the author cherry picks and spins just enough to create what appears to be solid arguments but doesn't have the courage to attach references or sources. Or perhaps he was wise to in that this thesis would not survive a cursory glance at the science. I was particularly offended by his patent distortion of or lack of knowledge of asbestos and its consequences."
2,faulty fact finding,"I am sure the author's views on global warming are influencedby the fact he is an advisor to Exxon/Mobil. Also, his statement that white asbestos is safe is false. The factthat white asbestos can cause disability and death has beenknown in Britain since 1898. The World Health Organizationconsiders white asbestos to be just as deadly as other forms.Sadly, some people put corporate profits above clean air and clean water."
4,Deafness as experienced by a hearing sibling,"I found this book to be very useful in talking about differences and believe that it CAN be a very useful tool in developing curricula around differences and treatment of people who are perceived as ""different."" Perfect? No, but nicely told through the eyes of a child."
2,"An Adequate Account, But Not The Best Example","As I, a Deaf adult, read this book, I found myself a bit irritated at times. It is very generalized and can be stereotypical, which I don't feel is the best example to teach a child about deafness (the whole purpose of the book). The pictures are all right, but not captivating and I'm not confident that they would keep a child's attention. As the title of my review reads, this is an adequate book to add to your library of deafness, but to stand alone as the sole example of a deaf child or deaf person...NOT recommended. :v("
2,Deaf? Different No Way!,"I would not recommend this book. I like one thing out of a lot of things and that is I liked how the sister understood how her sister had a disability and didn't treat her strange. But on the other hand, I didn't like 3 things. I didn't like the pictures. They made no sense. Two, I think the two sisters should have had a name. Three, they should have had ages. I would not recommend this book if you like humor, action, mystery or all of them together. But, for people who like to learn about disabilities, this is a good book for you."
1,Having A Deaf Sister,This book was about two sisters and one is deaf. The other sister tries to help her sister do normal every day things. I really didn't like this book because it was so slow. It was also very serious and it needed a lot more description. But I would recommend this book to kids ages 6-8. There were two main characters in the book. It didn't tell ages but I think one might be five and the other around 10. I think the theme of this book is that people are deaf and no different. These illustrations are kind of boring and they need a lot more color. This book took place at home and their school. This story really didn't remind me of any personal connections.
2,A Serious Story!,"This book was okay. Some parts I liked. For example, I liked that the kids at school were nice to the deaf girl and didn't make fun of her because of the way she talked or the fact that she was deaf. One thing that I didn't like was that the sisters didn't have any names. This book reminds me of how my sister's friend is deaf. My sister treats her no different than how she treats her other friends. The book's illustrations are in black and white, but they are very well drawn. At least I think so. The book is about a girl and her sister that is deaf, and how they care for each other. I think the author wrote the book to teach children and adults how deaf people live their lives. Also, to show us how it feels to have someone close to you who is deaf. Finally, that people are no different."
1,Stay Away From This Book!,"I read the book I Have A Sister, My Sister Is Deaf. I absolutely hated this book. It is about two sisters. The younger sister is deaf. The author shows how being deaf is no different than not being deaf. The older sister, who is not deaf, treats her sister like a regular person who isn't deaf. They play together very well.I didn't like this book because it lacked description and detail. I also didn't like this book because the pictures were dull and they had no color. I also didn't like how the author didn't give the characters names because I thought they should have names.The only thing I liked about the book was how it made me grateful to not have a disability. I would recommend this book for ages 3-6."
4,good stuff,this combo radio and ipod player is great. has decent sound and has a considered design that looks good while working.
4,"Does what it says on the box, mediocre but livable sound quality","I use this product in my bathroom. The master bath has a lot of extra counter-top space, and this sits in the corner and is tuned to the local AM news station in the morning while I shower and brush my teeth, etc. It works well for this purpose, though the AM antenna is actually inside the case (inaccessible), which means to adjust for the best reception, you must adjust the whole thing rather than just moving the antenna. The radio reception isn't stellar, but it's not bad either, just your average radio as far as that's concerned.I like it because I also every once in a while decide I want to listen to some music while I'm in the shower, and I can just drop in my iPod and let it play. Sound quality isn't the best, but it's not bad enough to make me dig into the manual to find out how to set the EQ. This is just a pretty good all-around radio/iPod/clock with a conveniently small and handy little remote."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This ""boom box"" player for iPODs has the worst sound imaginable! Two tin cans with a string attached has higher fidelity. The iPOD doc is flimsy and has no adapter to make the smaller ones not flop around while docked with it. Dont' waste your money on this item. We'll be attempting to dump it on someone else at our next garage sale, but I doubt anyone will spend a buck for it!"
3,tergiam,A little slow in spots. Reads like a fine piece of history. Soundtrack is good. Crowe would not have been my choce for the lead.
2,Ok but not at all great,When I watched the movie I don't even recall remembering much of the music. Maybe I wasn't paying attention or maybe it wasn't so good that my ears even wanted to pick it up. When I watched the movie a second time I payed more attetion to the score and the result was. The score wasn't all that good. An OK but nothing more.
2,SOUNDTRACK VS SCORE,"This is not really the soundtrack or the score. I wanted to hear the songs as they appeared in the movie, but these aren't all the same. Most notably the ending duet in the captain's cabin is not presented as it was scored in the movie. Also the sea chanties are not on the album -- how could they be omitted?IF I wanted classical renditions of the songs that were in the movie, I could get them in a number of different ways. What I wanted was the actual score of the movie, warts and all, not artist's polished RErendering of the songs the captain and doctor had ""played""."
5,Soothing Memorable Music,"I love this movie as an all time favorite and I loved the music, so I was so excited to get the soundtrack. This is very classical and period music, yet you will definitely be able to recognize it as the movie you loved so much. Also, very soothing."
5,One of my favorite fun CD's,"If you loved the movie, you might like to add this CD to your collection. I think it's well done, exciting, and a true companion to the movie. After buying this CD, I found myself wanting more cello and violin music from the 1700's and early 1800's.Too exciting to listen to while reading the novel, unless you turn it down during the drumming bits."
5,Soundtrack,"We love this album! Especially love tracks #3,6,7,9 & 14 and listen to it all day long as background music. The movie is one of our favorites!"
4,In All Fairness - re: Fantasia On A Theme...,"""Fantasia on a Theme..."" is correctly attributed in the film credits."
3,can someone help me with this ?,"hi all..i loved the film Master and Commander and i also loved alot of the music in the film..however, when i bought the cd , my first disappointment are the songs they sang around the dinner table...but more than that...is the musical piece played while they are burying the sailors at sea..and whilst saying ""the our Father"".that music is soooo beautiful..yet its not on the cd..its not listed in the credits..there is no mention of it anywhere..and its my favorite music of the film!can anyone help me with this?it sounds very baroque.thanks alot.carla811@aol.co,much appreciated mates!"
2,No Sea Shanties !,Sure I like the classical music but where are the rollicking sailor's songs ?One of the strongest aspects of the film score was the singing of sea shanties. The rousing sailor's traditional songs brought to life this film and they are not on this CD. Perhaps the studio suits don't like anything that sounds like pirate music ?
2,Not received as described,In the description I was told the item was new and sealed in package. The CD came opened and the case was damaged.
4,Track at the end,"In response to J. Greene, the track at the end is Boccherini's La Musica Nottruna del Strade Di Madrid, fourth movement (Passacalle). Got this from the end credits and searching Amazon and iTunes."
2,"Can't help it, disappointed","I fell in love with the Boccherini piece when I heard it in the movie, and bought the soundtrack mainly for it, but what you get on the CD is a very short arrangement and not very satisfying. It was also a disappointment to find that the soundtrack doesn't include the end titles music from the movie, which I enjoyed. It's still a good CD for listening, just not what I hoped for."
1,"Overpriced, not appealing for children; just plain black and white",I bought this book for my 5 year old and I wish I could return it. This is the type of book you can get at any Dollar Store. The drawings are so basic and there is not even one page in color in the whole book. My daughter flipped through the pages and put it right down and everytime I tried to present it to her she picked another one. Really boring for a child considering that my daughter LOVES everything that has anything to do with drawing and coloring. I wouldn't even buy it from the dollar store to be honest. Too bad my 1 year old torn one the pages off and now I'm stock with it. Sorry Scholastic but for this price you could have done better and added some color to at least some of the pages.
5,Teaches children how to draw,I bought this for my 8 year old who loves art. He is learning to draw very well because of this book.
3,Drawing Faces,My six-year-old grandson didn't like this book quite as much as the other drawing books he received for his birthday. The illustrations were pretty plain and not as exciting to draw.
4,Great start for an inspiring artist!,"My daughter loves drawing and I wanted a book that would help her gain confidence. This book gives simple instructions on how to draw easy pictures. However, I will tell you she said ""some of these are too easy"". She is six and is an average artist at her age. So if you're looking for something really advanced, this isn't the book for you! No regrets though, she's still learning!"
3,Simple,"Very nice book for mom's like me who have no artistic ability at all. Plus my 4 year-old who is somewhat artistically inclined seems to be able to follow the steps pretty easily. It entertained us, and will hopefully do so for awhile yet."
5,Helpful for the not so spritual,"I love Jung & I Love Kundalini yoga, but before I ever stepped foot in a yoga class, I read as much as i could find at the time. This book was very helpful to me. its also been very helpful when I explain the very spiritual, intangible practice of this very specific type of yoga to my atheist / scientifically minded / concrete thinking friends. Even some of my new age-y friends have trouble understanding when I describe sitting in a room full of white people wearing turbans, chanting in Sanskrit and waving their arms around for 90 minutes. But this book really helps bridge the divide of understanding. Jung takes a very scientific approach and breaks it all down. its a great book, even if you're not planning to don a turban and chant Sanskrit for an hour with your finger oddly entwined."
3,An Incredibly Intense Read,"I found this book an incredibly intense book to read. There's nothing simple about it. I had hoped for both clarity and understanding and received neither. I kept reading...hoping upon hope that Shamdasani's words would hold me spellbound and captivated.I seek truth in its simplest form, but did not find it here. While I am certain that Shamdasani's intent was to provide the reader with an intelligent read, his need for intellectual diatribes created, in stead, an emotional abyss; I found that I could not connect with his analysis without great intensity of focus. Frankly, I didn't have either the time or the inclination to work that hard to grasp the connections.Had Shamdasani employed simplicity of thought and content as his guides, the average reader might actually benefit from his wisdom and intellect."
1,book review,Jung was a researcher only.He had no experience with the kundalini.He borrowed ideas from here and there and changed there names.This chakra means this that chakra that.He had no experience himself.Chakras can be compared with nuclear bombs in there power.Kundalini lightning.For genuine seekers on the subject read gopi krishna and muktanandas autobiographies.Life manipulated jung as a seeker.He had a experience where he saw at the end his entire life was a manipulation of a hindu yogi.This was a vision life gave him.To talk on chakras and kundalini he would need to become that yogi.A genuine saint or mystic with genuine experience.He did alot of good in forwarding psychology ideas.However he was a researcher only not a kundalini experiencer
2,hmmmmm,This book is not bad. If you are into old school animation. It is a profesionally leveled book with lots of insight into building armetures and machining. For me it is a bit to precise to the subject area but a perfect one for anyone in stop motion . I would give 5 star
4,it very good.,it is cheap but good.i never thought i can buy a lock so cheap but tough enough.the key is safe.
1,I don't know,"I read this a while back. It was very idealistic, and suited for teenage sensibilities. More anti-intellectual leftist nonsense. Might have value as an historical curiosity."
1,Giant piece of junk,"This bag was way too expensive to be so darn flimsy. It comes with a security cable that is supposed to support the bag on the handle bars. I followed the instructions faithfully and tightened the cable as suggested. I didn't even have much stuff in it and the cable let go about halfway through my ride and the bag drooped. I had to re-do the entire installation and tighten the cable even more. I had to use plastic zip ties to secure it. The bag itself is fine, my issues it with the way it connects to the bike. Very flimsy. Don't expect to put much more than a few pounds in this very large and expensive bag."
4,Archetypel Haresy,"It is very informayive and close to the mark. As I have a large interest in theological readings ,I would read more work by same author."
2,Decal flakes off!,This would be a fantastic comforter except the decal flakes off very easily. We got this at Christmas and by April the decal was peeling off.
2,-every once in awhile you get one not quite up to par.,"After paying a premium for shipping and handling, the shipping was okay, the handling sucked. I had 10 small boxes of staples in a larger shipping box with no filler or even old crumpled newpapers to take up the extra space. Upon opening I found some of the cartons had come open and were all over the inside. They were to be used in a hammer tacker so individual broken ribbons of staples were useless. Poor planning on their part."
1,Horrible!,"I really had a hard time with this book. it was boring, jumbled, dull and I had to struggle to finish it. I have never wanted to throw a book away more. I thought it would be a wonderful futuristic romance but it never lived up to the cover. I found the characters very underdeveloped and the story didn't have a strong plot line. I felt like I had come into the story when it was almost over. I'm sorry but I cound't recommend this book at all."
1,Disappointing,"It's naive to think that 'Symphony of Enchanted Lands' can be topped. Well, now it's not even safe to expect anything close to it from those 'Hollywood Metal' makers.Their conclusion of their saga is simply terrible comparing to anything they had done before. Allright, the first song is not bad, but the rest of the material consists of... harsh vocals, strange narrator's passages and empty melody lines. Instead of developing their sound by exploring untouched melodical territories, these guys decided to ruin it by collecting garbage and mixing it with their music."
4,It's so hard to choose the best Rhapsody album,"Power of the Dragonflame is much alike all the others. It has its strong points and weaknesses. Personally, Dawn of Victory stands out a little better than all the others but right now I'm dealing with Power of the dragonflame. Every song is really a masterpiece combining power metal with sy,mphonic elements and choruses that show a great vocal talent. The only songs I feel would be left out from this description are When demons awake and Steelgods of the last apocalypse. In this last two, the rhythm is kinda messed up and unconsisstent. I really didn't like them. That's why I don't think it as a 5 star album. A 5 star album should have every song causing even a little wish to listen to it many times. Gargoyles, the last track is simply very long and really tires the listener."
4,Lose the Narrator,"This is a very talented band. I liked this from the first song,although they need more variation in their music-most songs sound the same. When they do change the nature of their songs, they are excellent. Their drummer only uses a few different beats(usually the frenzied sixteenth note double bass worn out riff) which really limits the sound of the songs. Listen to Symphony X- V for a much better version for this general music style. The last song is a fantastic epic which is TOTALLY RUINED by the dorky narrator who sounds like a very bad actor with a lisp-I laugh every time I listen to this. The narrative is poor as well. Still-I enjoyed this and will try another."
2,Bombastic & empty.,Good production can't obscure the overall daftness of this stuff. It's a bunch of Dungeons & Dragons gamers given too much time in a studio. In fact this is very similar to the D & D Dragonlance album released a few years ago but not as good! Dreadful narration finish off all hope of having something that can be listened to. Good cover art but don't be tempted. Awful.
1,Didn't like this...AT ALL.,"I said I was going to be honest in all reviews, and yes, I kinda clunkered on this one. I hate this CD. Simply put. They can't sing, and the songs are boring.I'm sorry I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that, but it's my opinion. I listen to power metal extensively and there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish or Sonata Artica.Don't buy this, though, you might like it. I'd definitely listen to it first."
5,Great CD from a Great Band,"For all us metalheads, this is one of the best albums to indulge our need for speed and high intensity riffing. And, the singer sings (how I hate the visceral, snarlingly growled lyrics of ""grindcore"". I can't tell what they're saying). This is what metal was always meant to be."
1,"Inane babble,","Its a shame Howard Zinn is residing in the bosom of Western Society. This tome rambles and rambles with his inane observations. Zinn is in the same vein as Nietzsche, he uses his hammer to destroy, not to build solution."
2,Core concepts obscured by lousy writing.,"Overall the concepts in the book are (1) important to understand and (2) easy to understand. So why is the book so poorly organized, the writing horrible, the examples unhelpful, and the book an overall disappointment? This isn't multi-variable calculus. The only logic I can posit is that the authors were more interested in writing a scholarly text than a readable one. Although many concepts are made unnecessarily complicated, the biggest grip I had is with the writing style. The examples only loosely tie in with concepts, and flowery ""professor-speak"" obfuscates relatively easy concepts pointlessly. And in their effort to be PC, they'll switch pronoun gender from ""he"" to ""she"" or ""him"" to ""her"" multiple times, even in the same example. Just sloppy. But the text covers the basics, so it gets 2 stars."
1,Disappointed with level of text,"This is a new textbook in the crowded field of business strategy texts. I had high hopes for a book authored by three excellent faculty members from Stanford's Graduate School of Business. The topic coverage is well targeted and includes such process issues as managing strategic change, aligning incentives, and the managers' roles in implementation. Unfortunately, most of the concepts derived from economics are illustrated with examples straight from an introductory undergraduate text in microeconomic principles. I would be embarrassed to use this book with my undergraduate strategy students or with my executive education seminars."
4,My kids love it (I think it is a little gross).,"If you like Wallace and Gromit type snimation and do not mind references to horse seagull or hippo dung every so often,this is for you."
3,Not as funny as the US show,If you have watched and enjoyed the US version of this show you are likely to not find the English show to be as funny as I think a lot of the humor in it is culturally related. Cute idea though and certainly entertaining.
2,annoying repetition,"We were eager to see the British version after enjoying the American so much. We found that each segment was quite short; preceded by an long irritating cartoon intro and followed by the complete list of everybody who'd ever worked on it. After eight or nine repetitions of these sets everyone was bored with watching the CD and we turned it off. General consensus was that the segments weren't as funny as the American version, making sitting through the intro/credits simply not worth it."
3,Amusingly depressing,The animation and the transfer of human characteristics to animals is amusing. But the subject matter is somewhat depressing and the pace is oh... so... slow...
5,Creature Comforts - both seasons,"If you love silly and intellectual at the same time, you will love these DVDs! A friend of mine loaned her copy of the 1st season to me and I knew I had to have my own so I ordered both seasons! The hamster is my favorite character."
4,Good so far!,"2,000 seeds seems like a lot until you see how itsy bitsy they are. It was a pretty small packet, but they covered a decent sized area (probably 10 square feet or so). They have sprouted now and seem to be growing well. No blooms yet, but I'm hopeful!"
3,Pretty Good For A first CD,I feel that this was a good cd for a first timer. It's a difficult task to complete. I think the second time around will be much better and with time she should catapult into another level of her young career
5,In Depth and Informative,"This is the definative guide for PDD-NOS, but also extremely helpful for use with our son who has Asperger Syndrome. Waltz covers the issue from every angle, including alternative treatments as well as conventional. Knowledge is power and Waltz gives parents the tools in this book to help our children in a powerful way. My son's pschiatrist borrowed this book from ME and said she learned a lot from it."
1,This book doesn't deliver.,"Pervasive Developmental Disorders : Finding a Diagnosis and Getting Help, is misleading, at best, lacking many multiple issues parent needs to consider. It needs to be revised and expanded with the assistance of knowledgeable professional currently researching the field."
3,Decent for a direct to video horror flick,"I didn't have incredibly high expectations going into this movie, given that it is a direct to video release. It is good for anyone that likes movies with a ""justice"" tilt to them. Think along the lines of ""The Crow"", a dark anti-hero arrives to punish those that do wrong. The movie does have some interesting takes on the convention of Hell that are something that I had not seen or thought of before. The acting is passable for the type of movie that it is."
2,Slow Burn,"I too am experiencing the problems of the original post. I purchased the 48x TDK 50 disc spindle. I was sent a 52x 50-pack spindle. So far, no matter the speed about 5 of 25 have successfully burned. Using Nero. I use the much less lauded Verbatims I have that are over two years old, no problems. I do not know what to make of it. Previous to this purchase, I had nothing but glowing reviews for TDK CD-R media."
1,Very unhappy,Burned Probley thousands of cds. all brands never have a problem. surprisingly enough this pack of tdk has had about 50 junk disk out of 100 so far. Never had problem with TDK Before.
1,prepare to lose your data!,"I have about 200 live concerts that I burned onto TDK discs about 3 years ago. None of them are playable now. Going forward, I will only use Mitsui Gold cds."
2,"good durability, burn errors galore","Blank CD-R companies always seem to be a hit or miss. Some have good durabilty, and some have good burning, some (only a few) have both, and some (once again only a few) neither. TDK is the company that has good durability of their CD-Rs, but almost half are errors.The packaging states ""48x"", so I burned at 48x on a Buslink drive (52x24x52). It choked, and took 10 minutes for Nero to say ""Burn error had failed at 48x"". So, I went lower at 32x. Same thing. Then I went to 24x and the thing finally worked. If a package says ""48x"", I'm expecting 48x, not 24x. Even at times 24x would choke and not burn correctly.Yes, I do have a few TDK CD-Rs that are 2-3 years old and look almost new compared to the 2-3 month old Sony, but with all these errors, will I ever get to experience that? Try looking at Maxell, Philips, and Samsung."
2,Skip it,I have been very disappointed with this product. I have burned CD's for years with great success but have found that this CD is causing imperfection after imperfection. I give it 2 stars for its reasonable price and because they don't all generate problems (about 25-30%).
5,Best ever,This is the best 2' step ladder I have ever used. I would not consider another. I use it every day in my window cleaning business.
5,The Way of the Wolf,"This is my all time favorite. In teaching classes,I have used the stories in this book for both adults and children. Martin Bell is a master storyteller. The stories can be read by anyone, but they are especially good when linked to the Christian faith. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,Surprising depth hiding in metaphors for the Christian life,"I first read this book in the 70's and it certainly reflects the Christianity of the 70's. It is clever but when Bell is on it has a surprising depth. I recommend it because through his stories and poems, Bell will challenge your faith while reassuring you that pain and doubt come with the territory."
4,Great Memory,This book is a great memory. I originally heard the cassette version of this book 30+ years ago. I'm glad to have the original now so I can share it with my children.
5,Top Drawer,"DVD ""A Man Called Peter"" from Amazon.com was, to me, just as advertised. Shipping was prompt and secure. If you're looking for a satisfied customer, you've found one."
5,Wonderful Christian message and entertaining,Wonderful Christian message and entertaining. This is one of my favorite old movies ( Despite the racist portrayal of the maid at the college.
5,"At long last, on DVD","(Review by James's wife Caroline:) This movie influenced me as a child, when I soaked in Catherine's speech about what it means to be a woman. And every time I see it, I learn something else from the lives of Peter and Catherine Marshall. Their story is part of our history as Americans, and as people who want to follow God wherever He leads us. Here's one I would recommend to anyone.I'm so glad it's now on DVD!"
5,A Man Called Peter,"Watched the movie in my youth and remembered it being a wonderfully moving experience so just wanted to see if it had the same effect and it did, again enjoyed it and am pleased to now have it in my DVD collection."
4,Excellent adaptation of biography.,"I dont know how old I was the first time I saw this film,but I was deeply moved by it.(FYI-for information on the filming, find a copy of Catherine Marshall's ""To live again"". Next to ""The Hasty Heart"",probably Richard Todd's best performance. As I understand it, the West Point sermon sequences were filmed on location....were supposed to just film Todd at beginning and end and do the rest in a studio,but the Cadets were so mesmerized that it was all done at West Point. Not as flamboyant as ""Elmer Gantry"" or ""The Apostle"", it is still a truly moving story of one man's faith and the effect it had on all he came in contact with during his relatively short lifetime. FOUR AND A HALF STARS."
1,not my kind of movie,I watched it for about 15 minutes and quit. It is not my kind of movie.I hate the fact that Amazon makes me waste my time with these required fields. This product was not worth my time.
3,Preaching to the Unconverted?,"In this artifcat from a simpler and more dignifed time, Dr. Peter Marshall as portrayed by Richard Todd, is ""a bit of a stiff,"" a WWII Muscular Christian [Jesus was a bronzed man with big carpenter's knuckles, Marshall asserts] whose career from humble Scots immigrant to Chaplain of the Senate is a somewhat bronze-shoed pageant. He could have been Ozzie and Harriet's pastor or stayed in the British Isles and been ""All Creatures Great and Small""'s pastor. He falls in love with his future wife when she harrangues a youth rally to the effect that we have come a long way from The Virgin Mary to smoking and cussing as equals of the men; no one is going to write any poems about such as us. Stirring visuals,economical sermonettes, excellent production values. A guilty pleasure for those who take religion seriously."
4,Very Good Family Move,"Saw movie and read the book (both non-fiction) in my youth, delighted to find it again and to find it as interesting as decades ago."
3,Disappointing,"From the back cover:""Ellen Farrell screamed as she raced her little car down the highway -it felt terrific to let off all that steam! Then she noticed she had company: an utterly gorgeous driver was keeping pace with her, and giving her the most devastating smile she'd ever seen! Conductor Armand Dante was no ordinary pick-up: he was dazzling -and the romantic hero of Ellen's secret dreams. When he sent her flowers on her nightshifts at the hospital and embraced her as the sun rose over the Potomac, she just had to fall in love. But could she cope with society column gossip and the hordes of adoring fans who wanted to share the man she'd chosen for her own?""It had promise, but I didn't much like this one. I thought the conflict was a bit contrived, being mostly that Ellen feared being in the public eye. It was simply not too interesting."
3,Nothing wrong with the item,"Actually, I didn't need this battery now.I had a sony DCR-HC85 handycam which duals as a 2MP digicam. Now, I got a canon digicam & don't the handycam for taking snaps.So, now that I am not taking snaps, the battery supplied with handycam is good enough to go for a day. Then, you can always recharge at night when u r home."
4,a diabetic,"This product Glucerna contains chromium picolinate which gives a slow rise of glucose,perfect to going from 72 to 103 but not higher.It does this within 10 minutes,keeping me from the ER. Free Super Shipping is great to.Tastes delicious."
5,Drink I send to my Mother in Illinois!,"I send this to my 89 yr old mother in Illinois whenever she can't afford the drink. She lives in a Mobile Home & lives on Social Security which isn't a lot. I talk to her quite often & she lets me know when she is low on money & I order from you. I am very happy with the UPS Delivery, as most times they know now that she is older & they will either leave the Box in between her screen & house door if shes not by front door when they come, otherwise if she is nearby & she can get to the door in time, they will bring it inside & put the box on her kitchen table where she can put it directly in her fridge. She is a Diabetic & loves the Glucerna Straberry 8oz Bottles in a 24 Each Box for only $40.00 & no shipping cost thru Amazon.com!"
4,A wonderful way to save the cooking and shopping day!,"I really like this book, it makes my shopping so much easier and the recipies are great too."
2,Not bad but expensive to follow,"Following this system raised my weekly food bill by $50 extra dollars. My teenager didn't take seconds during the month that I used this. The recipes called for more red meat and pork than my family is used to eating.On the plus side, it is nicely organized and gave me tips on creating my own lists better and even she uses more meat than I do normally, she also uses a greater variety than I'm used to. I will incorporate more vegetables because of her plan.It's a shame---I really wanted this to work for me!!"
1,lacking in flavor,I thought the recipes were pretty bland overall. After awhile I just started to add my own herbs and spices. Also she doesn't make much use of my favorite low carb versatile veggie--the tomato---as I would like.
1,Menus for the Rich and Famous,"Ok, maybe that's an exaggeration, but I was very disappointed. The grocery bill was 60. more than I normally spend. Also, the author makes an assumption that people who don't eat her menus must surely all be living on fast food, and says that's why our old grocery bills were lower. I wonder how she knows so much about everyone else. lol. We didn't live on fast food prior to buying this book, but we did have lower grocery bills and I'm going to go back to using common sense when planning my family's meals, which I used to do a week at a time, then keep those, and use them again in a few weeks.Also, her email customer service people were rude, but that's another story."
5,"EASY, Quick, Delicious, good for all in the family","I love to cook, and sometimes I'm too strapped for time. I'm not a big fan of prepackaged stuff, too much sodium or enriched ingredients, etc. I love this cookbook because it uses many whole foods and the amount of salt used is at my desretion. I grab this cookbook often the weeks I have limited time to prep and cook and to help us get out of the 'what do we feel like eating ruts'. Prep to table usually is about 30-35 minutes and not at all complicated.I have a picky eating family, who generally ask for seconds from the recipes here. I like the ability to download a shopping list off of the author's web site, and that author has considered what veggies are in season. All around a family winner and we're healthier eaters now too."
4,Smartest cookbook format EVER,"I purchased this cookbook and it is by far the smartest format that I've ever seen. I find it difficult to find the time to write a weekly menu, shop and cook daily. The book is arranged by season, and broken down into weekly menues AND shopping lists. So far I've completed 2 weeks of menues and they've been delicious. I have shared the meals with 3 other adults and all the recipes have been rated based on whether they'd like to have them again in the future. I am happy to say the recipes got 3 out of 4 thumbs up, and 4 out of 4 thumbs up. I am very pleased with the recipes and the cookbook is making my life easier and providing a lot of variety."
5,low carb cookbook,I really like the way this book gives suggested serving for both low-carb and normal eating... so everyone eats the main entree and side dishes vary.
4,Lovin' Low Carb!,"I've been faithfully using the original Saving Dinner for quite some time and purchased SDLC about 2 months ago. I love the low carb version equally but differently than the original. For starters, I thought going low carb was a fad. Little did I know the nutritional benefits! Second, these menus serve 4 instead of 6. Since it's just me and my 1 year old DD, I use 1 week of menus to last 2 weeks. It's great and I don't have so many leftovers that I feel like I'm eating the same thing all the time! Third, I've discovered I love soup. Who knew?!? I thought I was a soup-hater. Turns out I LOVE homemade soups and have a huge distaste for the canned stuff. Finally, I've learned to embrace new vegetables. This is a big deal for me. I'm 26 and only learned to love vegetables in my 20s. Now I'm expanding my horizons even more.If you haven't checked out Leanne Ely's books, I encourage you to do so. Be adventurous! Try something new! If nothing else, learn how to plan a menu the way she does."
2,disappontment,Too much singing/chanting in a really annoying way detracts from the excellence of Mr. Jones and the other musicians on this disc. Not really listenable.
2,Shadowland is weak!,"I've heard good things about this disc,but it came off weak and uninspired to me. Not too mention I don't care for the vocalist,lack of intersting time changes,and the guitar solos interludes are just too damn short. If you want kick-ass power/prog get Wuthering Heights' To Travel Evermore or Symphony X's The Odyssey. These two bands have REAL metal chops!"
2,My bike was stolen in 16 seconds with this lock,"I have a so-so bike. With rips and scratches in many places. I locked my bike with this cable. It worked for 5 months. Then last Monday 11/10/08, it happened. The thief came over to my bike, bent down and within 16 seconds, rode off my bike. I saw this on the surveillance tape. it would have taken me longer to unlock my own bike knowing the combination. So, in essence, yes, the thief wanted my bike. He was a professional and he has my bike."
1,Bike Stolen after 10 minutes,"This happened the first time I used this lock. I chained the bike in front of a Best Buy and while I was inside (10 min), the bike got stolen. Very disappointed."
1,"please, please, please do not buy",My bicycle was stolen. The thief simply cut through the wire. It was in broad daylight and in a semi-crowded area. The lock's cable was so cheap that the thief was able to easily cut through without anyone noticing. It will not protect your bicycle.
4,Solid product,Bought this to have for my new bike. This is a very solid product and I feel it would do what it is intended to do.
1,Failure,"After just 2 weeks in use, the lock seems to have reset internally and cannot be opened. No amount of jiggling, tugging, respinning the cartridge or trying numbers ""one off"" worked. Fortunately, it was very easy for campus security to cut the cable (as I guess a thief could). Maybe it was too cold--30F tonight.A real waste of $15."
3,Escape From Doing Chores!,"Good flick, entertaining and with acting that makes you feel you watching true life. The action scenes can be exciting but no blood and guts for the gore lovers. As most can tell by the actors list of names this is an older move. I know I saw this move years ago but we enjoyed watching the move again. When I say we enjoyed the move both me and the younger folk in the family. So skip those chores and watch a goody but oldy!"
3,"Abstraction Meets ""Smooth Jazz""","That's really about as best as I can put it. This stuff isn't way out there, but it's definitely got a cerebral quality. On the one hand it is accessible, on the other I guarantee you're not going to be humming any of the tunes later on. This is for thoughtful, private listening. If you put it on at a party, you will immediately annoy everyone. Another description that comes to mind is radio-friendly, contemporary jazz from a parallel universe, where all the rules are a little different. I would be amazed, however, if there is a commercial radio station in our own dimension with a format to accomodate it."
2,Beaten by the real thing,"As a fan of the band, of the songs chosen for this compilation, of live performances, and of rare recordings, I should be delighted with ""Best of the Bootlegs."" Except that the sound quality is awful . . . and I don't mean ""audiophile"" awful. I mean, ""Wha??"" awful. I've heard many a bootleg with far superior sound.I would suggest getting the ""Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends,"" ""Works Live,"" or ""King Biscuit Flower Hour"" sets first. All are from legitimate sources, and the first two together offer a pretty complete portrait of ELP live in the 70s. ""KBFH"" is a two-disc set combining a ""Works Live""-era performance (from the latter part of the tour) on the first disc with a 1974 version of 'Karn Evil 9' (as well as multimedia material) on the second disc. It's a worthwhile addition to the other two live albums because, unlike ""Works Live,"" the first disc is without an orchestra and includes a version of 'Pirates.'"
3,ELP Bootlegs,Well it makes me mad that they came out with this CD after I already bought the other two boxsets but that's the way things go I guess!? Anyway this CD is worth getting if you are a diehard ELP fan. It has some of their best performances from the 70's which was their best years.
1,Not A Null Modem,"I needed a small form factor Null Modem and a Gender Changer, this item promised to be be both in one package. Upon installation in my setup (GPS to position enabled radio) the GPS unit was not communicating with the radio. Checking the GPS, I found it to be functioning fine, checking the cables, I found them to be working. I then checked the individual pin-outs on this device and found all pins to be a straight through. 1->1, 2->2, 3->3, etc. This is NOT a null modem but it makes a fine gender changer if you happen to need one. If you need a Null Modem, buy something else."
1,This is NOT a Null Modem! Don't order!,"I needed a null modem, saw this, and was attracted to the small form-factor.Received the product, and it's clearly labeled ""NULL MODEM"".However, upon a failure to communicate between my two serial devices, I did some research and discovered that this adapter is wired straight through.It's just a plain old gender changer, nothing more.This is a rip-off.*** DO NO ORDER ***"
1,DO NOT ORDER!,"DO NOT ORDER, This is not a null modem the picture and description says it is but they ship you a gender changer in a bag labeled null modem. Didn't take the time to read all the negative reviews before and I paid the price as now I have to return. Save your time and don't order from Cablemass, Inc. Hopefully amazon stops letting them sell on here"
1,not required...,"According to the Uniden web site a whole other cable assy is needed, and NOT this gender changer. The cable is not available on Amazon. I had to go to Uniden's web site and order via Scanner Master"
1,"Mini Null Modem DB9 Male / DB9 Male, Adaptor","BEWARE, MISLEADING!!! This is only a male to male adapter. It is NOT a Null Modem. Only and adapter. I bought this for my HP1 SCANNER and it required a Null modem for Gps hook up. I ended up buying a real Null Modem from Rsdio Shack for 4 bucks and that one works like a charm. The adapter I warn you about is now in the woods behind my house were it will stay till I refind it and pulverise it. This company should be more clear about there crappy useless item."
1,Falsely advertised. This is NOT a null modem.,"This item is a mini gender changer ONLY. it is not cross wired to act as a null modem and does not function for that purpose. The distributor admits this fact, offered to refund my 13 cent purchase but has not removed the item for sale or modified the description, which makes me believe that this was advertised incorrectly on purpose to generate sales.Incidentally, the shipping on a 13 cent item is $2.98."
1,NULL NULL,I should have read the reviews before I ordered.These are NOT null modem.They are wired straight through despite being labeled as NULL MODEM.
3,The large ones look cheap,"The small one looks good but the medium, and especially the large look so cheap! Haven't worn them for that reason. I wish I didn't get them."
3,Not for thin people...,"I have a really flat belly button, so when I put this belly ring in, it stuck out REALLY far...so far that I had to take it out. It doesn't look right, but I'm sure if you have more skin to hide the bar it will look cute."
3,Ok for Tremor Fans,"I happen to like the TREMORS movies so this movie was somewhat interesting to me. However, my wife who is not a Tremors fan, thought it was stupid. My biggest problem is that I'm not a huge fan of the prequel concept. Notwithstanding that, it was fun seeing Michael Gross do what he does best."
3,Big Disappointment,"Only a Tremors die hard would love this. It is way too talky, has little action and sorely misses the charm of Fred Ward to save it. I really like the Bert Gummer character but this wasn't him! I don't think the treatment adds to the Tremors legacy as there is no discussion of their source or anything like that. Guess this is because of the setting and that it depicts ""dumb"" cowboys and settlers. Definately worth a look if you like the series but to me the very least of the Tremor's legacy."
2,For Michael Gross fans only,"OK, I liked all the 3 previous Tremors films. Even when the budget sank lower with each successive sequel, at least the things were funny. Tremors 4, sadly, isn't even all that funny. The film is way too talkly, with very little action to speak of. Yeah, it's cool to see the beginning of the ""graboids,"" and Michael Gross deserves credit for his 180 degree turn from our beloved Bert Gummer. And the film isn't without its minor charms (the town of Perfection--as much a character in this series as Gummer himself--started out with the lamentable name ""Rejection""), and those may be enough to satisfy die-hard fans.In the supplemental materials, the crew (and Gross) liken this film to the original Tremors. I sure hope they go back and watch the first film before making another one."
3,Tremors 4(2004 Horror) PG-13,"1889: Rich guy Hiram Gummer comes to a town called Rejection to see why people stopped mining and making him more money. The cause is those big nasty worms from the other Tremors films. Crazy property wars insure, and so far, the worms are winning. Hiram needs all the help he can get to reclaim the mines, and maybe even save the town of Rejection. The worms look slightly better, even though, the small segment of one being CGI made it look crappy and fake."
1,Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins,"This is one of the worst films that i have ever seen. It does not even come close to the class of the 3rd one, never mind the 1st.The first hour went by and i could have easily been mistaken that this was not a tremors film, with hardly no graboid action at all. Michael Gross, as Hiram, is a total plank, nothing like the Bert we all know and love.I have just thrown this dvd into the bin and good riddens."
1,Quite Expensive Book,The book is really expensive for an international edition. The seller needs to state it clearly on the main advertizing page that it's an intl. edition. The caption it's like new for a price of $95 is very deceptive since the actual intl edition ranges between $55-$70. I bought the book at the advertised price with the thinking that it was the US edition.
2,Dated,"Standard textbook outlining most spectroscopic techniques as taught at undergraduate level. However, contains an embarrassingly dated treatment of mass spectrometry which can not have been rewritten since the 1970s. No mention of the biggest MS techniques in use today (electrospray and MALDI), a glaring oversight especially in light of Fenn & Tanaka winning Nobel Prizes in 2002 for just these developments. And time-of-flight instruments having a mass range of 5000 and resolution of 200? Several years before this book was published, commercial machines were available with mass ranges well over 100,000 Da and resolutions of 10,000+. Not only poor, but misleading. Overall, a rather derivative book that seems to have been written largely by consultation of more authoritative work (probably an early edition of Williams & Fleming)."
5,PRESENTALES A JESUS,"The production is very attractive to children. My 5 and 7 years old have watched the different stories over and over. Before going to school they used to watch useless TV, with this videos, the Bible stories are sinking in and giving us lots of opportunity to talk of the History of the People of God... a great tool for the non-reading ages.The stories stick to the Bible version, not distorted or invented... It's the Bible illustrated... and it shall never pass!"
4,Baseball movie,"This was a good movie, I bought it for my grandson, , he is in college going to be a coach , he loved it"
4,The final season,A good family movie. There is a bit of foul language but for the most part this movie is clean.A small town school is being merged into a bigger district school. The Norway team plays it's last game for their town. Sweet story that I can recommend for the whole family.
4,Feel-good sports story,"This movie is based on the true story of a small town in Iowa which produced a large number of top baseball players and which won the Iowa State 1-A Baseball Championship an amazing 20 times. Things are going well for the small town of Norway, until the state and local school boards decide to consolidate their school with another district's high school. The citizens complain that their baseball heritage is important to the social and economic future of their town, but their pleas fall on deaf ears. The school board removes the popular and successful baseball coach for Norway's final season and replaces him with a man who spent half of a season as Norway's assistant coach and the rest of his career coaching girls' volleyball. The story is enjoyable and inspiring and is well told in this movie."
2,God bless small towns in Iowa,"This movie offers a compassionate insight into the politics and pride of small towns. I was compelled to watch because it's about my mom's hometown, Norway, Iowa. While we can talk about all of us in America having the same core values, it's interesting to see how the values are expressed in small towns versus cities."
3,Hoosiers Lite,"A painted-with-broad-strokes, passable, passionate, predictable baseball movie which is based on a true story. Although it evokes ""Hoosiers"" in many ways, it doesn't come close to that film's charm. Nevertheless, ""The Final Season"" tells a worthwhile story in a briskly paced, pleasant way. My favorite scenes are the ball game scenes with the trains and the scenes with Larry Miller's sportswriter character. Rated PG for some language."
2,Baseball movie,"Thought this would be a good family film, if only the swearing wasn't there, I could agree. Good story line."
3,I think I've seen this movie before,"This is a blatant rip-off of ""Hoosiers"" translated from Indiana high school basketball to Iowa high school baseball. Against all odds the tiny rural school wins the state championship - that's the basic plot. Beyond that, there are so many plot details and visual details that are just plain copied. If you haven't seen ""Hoosiers"" you will probably enjoy this movie because you won't realize how much it lacks originality. If you have seen ""Rudy"" you will be constantly distracted by observing that Sean Astin has gotten so fat that he is barely recognizable. Notwithstanding these gripes, it's fairly entertaining."
5,"If it's not here, you don't need to know it","I have checked out at least 30 books from our city and county library systems on saltwater fishing from all over the country on inter-library loan. None were as good as this one! This is the only book that has the hooks, rigs, lures and knots associated with a particular type of fishing in their own section. This is extremely helpful compared to pages of unassociated graphics. The photographs (and there are plenty of them) are all in color and the paper is a high quality gloss matte. There are pencil graphics of techniques. The sections on cleaning and cooking your fish are outstanding with a few recipes thrown in. Each type of fish is identified with the bait to use, method of catch, where to catch them and what equiipment to use. Good water-resistant cover. Can't go wrong with this one."
1,Useless,This book was a primer for people that have had no exposure to Saltwater fishing. Having had some experience with saltwater fishing I found this book useless. There was no coverage on the proper tackle to be used and the techniques to deploy.
5,Great Mystery Books!,"I discovered Mary C. Jane books at my parent's house. Apparently my older sister was addicted to them as a child (and hid them from me since I didn't know about them.) I love the settings of these books. Just the right blend of ""spooky"" happenings and ""danger."" I read them to my 10 year old son who is a Scooby-Doo fan. Great for introducing kids to mystery books! I wish they would print new editions, but reading a mystery from an old book also ads to the fun."
3,Feels Cheap,"This calculator works as promised, but it is poorly made. Sometimes the buttons stick down, which causes big problems if you don't notice right away. It's a shame because the functions are good. We bought 3 and they are all the same."
3,"Great glasses, but only fits certain faces","I have many pairs of Gargoyles sunglasses. This was a more recent purchase. While I love most of my Gargoyles, this one let me down, as it is shaped and curved in such a way that if you have higher wider cheekbones and a smaller flatter nose, the glasses will rest on your cheeks instead of where they properly should. Alas, these beatiful sharp looking glasses were unwearable for me.These glasses are made to fit classic caucasian face structure with deep-set eyes, high nose, and narrower cheeks. Everyone else (eg, asians) be very careful buying this, as you will likely have to return it, or give it to someone else (as I did)."
5,It Makes You Think...,"And that, to me, is a good book. This was a Kindle freebie and after reading it, I wanted to read more of James Scott Bell's books.The plot was enticing...a Supreme Court Justice whose beliefs were well-formed, a change in her faith and how that impacted her position within the Supreme Court and politics surrounding that...some good twists including an ""untypical"" sub-ending and just a little twist for the real ending.The logic and background were interesting. I started the book and didn't put it down until I finished it. A good read!And now, I have to go read my second James Scott Bell book."
4,A page turner deep into the night,"This is a what if legal thriller that demands you pay attention!This is the nightmare ""what-if"" scenario for the radical left. Suppose a liberal Supreme Court justice had a religous experience (or to put it blunter, she becomes a born-again, Bible-reading believer).Go further and explore the impact her conversion has on her pro-abortion, establishment clause and ""living constitution"" vs. original intent beliefs.Add one last goodie. While she is examining her positions, a liberal president (Al Gore, perhaps) nominates her as Chief Justice.Now you've got the pot boiling.The pro-abortion lobby has built an entire industry atop a fragile, and increasingly frail legal latticework. Should that ever truly be threatened, then are there any limits to politcal attacks or has the division between left and right gone too far?I finished this one around 2:00 AM. You might want to start this on a Friday night so you can sleep in on Saturday."
1,not for the open minded,this poorly veiled right wing lecture portrays all liberals as drunks and athiests and the good guys as model christians.
3,Good sense of adventure and dislocation by star gates,"I've reread this over the years. Although the adventure format is not intellectually challenging, it isn't predictable, and it does give a very good sense of how disjoint civilizations might get when their primary interplanetary travel is disrupted over an entended period. Not reading the 1963 short story it was based on, it's a little difficult to tell whether the confrontation between those who wish to let native civilizations evolve naturally -- or to exploit them -- is from ""Star Trek"", or vice versa. The descriptions of the various native worlds and locations are convincing. A few hours' of pleasant reading."
2,"""Stink"" is ruined on this disc","When I saw ""Get Shorty"" in the theater, one of the best parts was the music. In particular, ""Stink"" plays over the closing credits and is a fantastic song. It's completely ruined on this disc because it includes some obnoxious vocals / yelling. Otherwise, this is a good disc."
1,"Watts is excellent, but they screwed up the cassette","I have read Alan Watts now for many years. I used to listen to him on PBS in Berkeley. Watts has a fantastic and interesting style of speaking. He has absolute authority, is interesting, witty, funny, has a great speaking voice. This I knew. What I didn't know was that they simply have small sections of actual Alan Watts speaking, other than that they have some ""cheesy"" eastern-synth style music ""droplets"", and not meaning to be mean here, a person that is about as interesting as cardboard reading from, presumably Watts book. In other words, instead of spontenaity that Watts always has, this is cement...it is static. It is the anti-zen. Somehow they have made Watts writing (if this IS Watts writing..not quite sure about that) pompous and self important. It really, really, [stinks].I will search and find some tapes OF Alan Watts, and they can keep the extra stuff..."
4,Great translation for Western thinkers.,"I read this book in 1983 and still consider it one of the most important books I've read. Zen is a difficult concept for Western thinkers. I'm not into ritualistic behaviors. I don't sit in certain positions to do my contemplation. I don't feel a need for religious repetition of phrases, sounds, ideas, or postures. This is why I was and still am attracted to the way of zen. If you want to get a grasp on letting go and enjoying the art and possibility of being human, read this book."
4,Very Good book.,I've been studying and practicing Buddism on my own for about five years. Recently a friend of mine said I should read this book. I really enjoyed it my only complaint is that it was a little dty.
5,sparks of dripping water,"well.....I happened to get this book on a dirty shelf placed along a tiny street close to piazza Navona, Rome. A used and pretty ruined copy was just there...among many other sleazy books.....I just saw it and bought it....and guyz.....was that a lucky strike! I read the book over and over....finding it more and more shining.....that was the clearest and more faccinating thing I've ever read about zen....even though zen shouldn't be read, but just experienced. Still, whenever I happen to reach out for it and open it randomly, I always get words of wisdom and shots of pure clear water.....I just gifted it to an old friend.....I mean my own copy.....and now I'm about to get a new one for myself...just read it....read it and go out and run and be and look at the fireworks and the calmness.....just walk and be a bowl of rice and switch off your mind....."
4,Engaging,"Not only is this a great introduction into Zen (and larger philosophical problems), but also a competent critique of contemporary Zen Buddhism in Japan (of course by contemporary, I mean circa 1957). This work presents Zen as a specific historical hybrid of two similar cultural trajectories (Buddhism and Taoism). It is scholarly (including Chinese notes of the specific technical words/ideas and important passages and quotes) which allows Watts to be both an advocate for and a critic of this system of thought - at once shows the usefulness and also the contradictions inherent in Zen as a system or practice. It is never about finding a ""new"" system but about learning how to see one's own system as a construct that smooths over the randomness with the semblance of coherent consistency."
3,Not quite; Nice try though,Essentially this is the tv version without bleeps or blurred out pictures. However there is a scene on the uncensored that still has blurred out picture. DVD #4 is essentially a replay of previous cases presented in the other DVDs. No special director's cut or extra footage. This DVD I consider to be a waste of money has I didnt get any extra pictures or footage . I expected to have a directors cut or something special. Simply a compilation of same tv cases same presentation without bleeps and blurry pictures. If u need to purchase one I'm selling.Final Ratings : not the best buy
2,Go to your local video store not worth the money,"My advice go rent it. I'm very disappointed with this dvd set. Yeah, you get to see full frontal nudity and penetration but then my interest started to go down. The remainder was just the cursing. The last dvd is mostly repeats of Disk 1 and 3. The only thing different is Joey Grieco is hosting them. Cheaters chumped me. I'm so glad I renteD this.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"good concept, but kind of boring","This show has a great concept... outing cheaters and humiliating them, however, the best parts are in the last few minutes of the segments. The set up is quite slow and boring, and I found myself fast forwarding qute a bit to the end. Also, the ""jerry springer"" type endings can be monotonous."
3,Very weird,"Wow, this is insane! Review after review imploring you to buy the DVD.The show itself isn't that bad actually, however, whenever transfering tv shows that are based upon surprise and shock to dvd, the whole essence of the show is lost.After all, how exiting is it watching the same partner get 'surprised' at being caught for the umpteenth time?Anyway - for a change - don't bother buying the dvd - its a waste of cash.Seriously."
5,The best episodes of Cheaters on one disk!,"Since I have such a busy schedule I occasionally miss some of the new episodes of Cheaters, so now that I have the dvd set I was able to catch up on some of my favorite episodes and some new ones that I didn't catch earlier. Since buying the set I haven't been able to stop playing those ugly and gruesome confrontations, I even got my sister into Cheaters, now we can both watch all of the episodes together!"
5,Cheaters,"I'm a big fan of reality television and I got hooked on this show when I saw it on television. The endings are always the best. The show gets so intense, I mean remember the episode where the host got stabbed!? I wonder what else this ""Best of Cheaters"" DVD will be filled it! Can't wait to get myself a copy of it."
5,One of the best organized interests books out there.,"from the back ""the first title in the New Diretions in Political Behavior series, provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of interest group politics in the United States. The book examines how organized interests are born, how they survive, how they operate, and how they influence public policy.""As former student of the author, I can say that Dr. Nownes knows his stuff. His classes were always fun, but I left knowing a lot more than I went in with. His book, ""Pressure and Power"" is an excellent source for info on organized interests. Nownes has written extensive amounts on this subject in the past, and continues to be an expert in the field."
1,"Pitiful, obvious writing and predictable plot","I tried, really tried, to like this book, but no matter how many badly written, cheesy parts I skipped, there was always another on the next page. It is clear as day that the author makes Isobel dislike Morgan in the beginning to supply the generic Romance-Novel Conflict, making the conflict, and the plot in general, uninteresting and unbelievable. These characters never feel real, they lay flat on the page, and the reader never really cares whether they get together in the end."
5,YUMMY !!!,"This book was a fantastic and delicious treat. I often read many books at one time but when I started this book I put all the others on the back burner! Lady Isolbel and the Dragon Knight are spellbinding as they traverse through various life-threatening experiences. There is someone within their midst that cannot be trusted..a terrible evil spreads and wipes out whole villages. Lady Isolbel and Morgan of Nels (AKA Dragon Knight) are hot, hot, HOT! The descriptions of the land and the castles of the time are unbelievable. Be prepared to be transported across the seas through mist and fading light into a brilliant action-thriller with lots of action or EVERY kind. This is an awesome read and I assure you that you won't be disappointed. This is my first Patricia Phillipis book and I'm searching for more!"
1,poor charleton heston!!,Take a vhs copy of this movie and letterbox it. Then run it off on a dvd-r and sell it to some poor slob for $15.00 and sit and laugh yourself sick because some fool bought it at that price.you will be sea sick from the jerking images burned on this dvd-r disc!!
4,Canadian Dance/Hi-NRG,"Joee DiSimone sings on this track, don't confuse it with Intonation, which is the producer of the track. It's got a positive vibe to it and is still really big in clubs up here in Canada (Joee is from Toronto...well Maple...)but this is a really good song."
5,Great Blanket!,"I wouldn't even call it a blanket, it's more of an all purpose matt. It is so silky soft and durable. My 14 month old son tries hard to dirty it at times, but it's really easy to wipe off, and it's easy to tote around b/c it folds nice and is so compact. We use it everywhere(grass, sand, on concrete @ Disney), it's nice that it's waterproof and I think it's thicker than a traditional blanket. I also love the chocolate/pink stripes, the picture doesn't do it justice; it's really beautiful. This blanket is awsome!!!"
1,horrible smell,This blanket has the most toxic smell ever! I am returning it immediately! I am trying to research if it's made of pvc but that information is not readily available.
4,Love it!,I bought this blanket for my 5 month year old son to play on and do tummy time. It's so soft and easy to fold up to store away. Great for traveling also! The only thing is that the velcro catches a ton of debris and it's hard to remove it. Minor thing but annoying.
1,Beyond Disappointed with this Blanket!,"I had very high hopes for this blanket, despite the negative reviews about the awful toxic odor, because there were still so many other positive reviews here on Amazon and on other merchants' sites, and I also really like the other JJ Cole Collections products. I thought perhaps I would have better luck, or that the odor would not be as bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be. But it was WORSE! After opening the package, I immediately smelled the horrible toxic-plastic smell. It was completely overwhelming to the point that after I put the blanket back in its packaging and shipment box to return it, I still had the smell in my nose and throat! Terrible! I wish there were a way to give it just a half of a star for this so you could see that it's been reviewed, but it does not even rate a full star. 0.5/5 = 10% = very low F."
2,"rubber smell too strong to use indoors, even after washing twice","This is more of a rubber mat with a fabric cover. I would not have called it a ""blanket"" if I'd seen it in person first. I bought this to use both indoors and outdoors, but the rubber chemical smell is too strong to have inside the house or in my car. So it lives in the garage now, and I have yet to find anything to use it for. I did wash it twice, and the smell is reduced but still pretty strong. I don't think it would bother me for a picnic on the grass outdoors, but it's not acceptable otherwise.Would not buy this if I could do it over again."
5,Great Blanket,"I bought this item for use at the beach. I lay it down first and then put my towels over it. It is a great item and I'm glad I have it. Easy to carry and fold up after use, and the sand seems to fall right off when I shake it."
2,Polyurethane Exterior and Polyester Fill,"I just called the company to find out what the blanket is made of, and was told that it is 100% Polyurethane exterior, and 100% Polyester Fill.Polyurethane is a form of flexible plastic, which is a turn-off for me. I think I will go with the similar (slightly longer at 7ft. - 84""X54"") TUFFOblanket instead, which is 100% Cotton on top and Nylon on the back, also water resistant. The fabric make-up may not bother somepeople, but one of the reviews said that the blanket off-gassed an icky smell, which prompted me to find out what it is made from.I gave it two stars because I was forced to give it something, and others seem pleased with it. I'll take cotton/nylon though. :)"
3,poor quality or perhaps a dud...,"I am quite impressed with the size and quality of the blanket itself, but both snaps on the strap broke the first few times I used the blanket. With broken snaps, there's no easy way to carry the blanket, so I had to duct tape the snaps closed, so I could use the strap to carry the blanket. It works, but I was disappointed that BOTH snaps broke so quickly. Nobody else seems to have had this problem, so maybe mine was just a dud. I do love the blanket though and use it all the time."
5,Good product,"This was extremely useful when I first had my son. It lived in the car and went to the park, the beach, as well as the garden. Easy to roll and unroll with one hand if you have to hold the baby too. Colours aren't too bright nor yucky and it looks like it will last many more years."
4,it's new,"i haven't played a whole lot with it,but i have seen it like the color. material. made for outdoor picnics."
5,Good picnic blanket,This is perfect for a day at the park or a day at the beach. It cleans up nicely and I love how it folds into a bag. It doesn't take up very much space at all. I keep it in my trunk all the time; you never know when it will come in handy.
4,Wrong Pattern,"I had purchased this item perviously for a gift and planned on purchasing one for myself to keep in the car. I had to wait as it wasn't available only to be sent the item in a different pattern. The pattern (stripes) I received is fine, but definitely not the cocoa bubble pattern that I waited for. As it isn't imperative that I have the cocoa bubble pattern, I am keeping the item I received, but it was a disappointment after having to wait."
5,Great value!,"I bought this after seeing a friend's, and I love it! We use it for our 6 month old baby- we have hard wood floors and I've been looking for something that he can lay on and roll on, but that I can put away when done so we can have our living room back. We use it daily; I only wish it were a bit thicker because now that he's rolling over and lifting his head, when he gets tired, he kind of hits his head on the floor. I've taken it outside, to friends' houses- you name it. Easy to carry, transport, clean, etc."
4,A good ground cover for babies.,"It's big (for an infant), it cleans up easy, and it's relatively cheap. Not unattractive, either. If it just folded up a bit more easily, I'd give it five stars. As it is, we haven't found a better ground blanket for our babies."
4,Great Blanket,"This is a great blanket. Perfect for the beach, park or backyard. It is very easy to fold. The Velcro is on the bottom so it picks up grass and dirt but overall it is a wonderful blanket. The top fabric is very soft and easy to clean."
4,"Not a blanket, but good waterproof mat","This is by no means a blanket, but it is a nice waterproof mat. I like the large size. I bought it to take my baby to the park and have a blanket for the grass at different events. We plan on using it at the beach this summer, I think it would be perfect for the sand. I am afraid the white stripes are going to get dirty. Best feature: It folds up so you can carry it on your shoulder and leaves your hands free."
5,Awesome blanket!,"This is an awesome must have! I got this a gift while expecting, and it's on of my favorite things.. Fits perfect under the stroller, or I use the carry strap when we are stroller free. Easy to keep clean and comforatable for the park, outdoor concerts, soccer games, everything! This is a must have for anoyone that enjoys relaxing out doors!"
4,Great kids blanket!,"We received the blanket just in time for the beach- and it is wonderful! No sand, no stains, no fuss. Highly recommend for parents of little ones."
4,So far so good!,"I go to the beach a lot with my kids and this is great! It is waterproof! It feels very soft also, and is a perfect size"
4,JJ Cole Blanket,"Love this blanket. It is great to have when going out to parks or the beach. There is just enough room for him to crawl around a little. He does seem to want to explore what is just off the blanket, but I didn't figure it would be a way to gate him in while outdoors. The only change to the blanket I would make would be to make a protectve sleeve for the velcro when it is unfolded as it tends to have grass and other debris stick to the exposed velcro."
5,"Loved it so much, I ordered 2!","This is a superb blanket, it should be part of your ""essentials."" It is high quality, durable, and stylish. I ordered the Cocoa with Bubbles (for my mom) and the Gray/Red for myself. The colors were true to what I saw on my monitor. It wipes clean; spills and spit ups from my baby are not a problem! I've owned a similar type blanket before (don't remember the brand) but it wasn't as easy to fold as this one nor was it waterproof. Aside from using this blanket outdoors on the damp grass, I also use it indoors for baby's tummytime. I can't wait to head out to the beach soon! Finally a blanket heavy enough that the ocean breeze won't blow away! (By the way, it's not that heavy that it's cumbersome as others may claim, it weighs less than 5 lbs.)"
5,Great Blanket,"Folds down easily, can be wiped down after heavy use. Can even go in the washing machine. I use it for exercise, picnics, the beach, etc. Love it!"
3,disappointed,I love the function of the blamket but on my second use the strap broke! I had it in the closet for months before using and was so excited to take it out for the summer months. It is now difficult to carry around but it is great once we take it to our destination.
4,spendy - but worth it,got this for my wife when we managed to leave our previous zip up picnic blanket at a soccer game ;-) so far she loves it the insert guide that helps with folding makes life easier and it's heavy enough that light winds and little feet don't move it around/create wrinkles/ and flip parts over.
2,Blanket dissolving after 1 use,"Delivery of the blanket was fast, I also liked the look of it. However the striped fabric started coming apart at the edge, where it is sewn to the grey border. The stitches are intact, but since the striped fabric has no firm edge, it is dissolving into single fibres. The padding is visible now. I will try to fix it using textile glue, but it is only a question of time, until the fabric will come off all around the border. Quite disappointing! (I tried to upload a picture, but this did not work)."
4,Really good item,"easy to carry, sand shakes out easily. A little hard to fold back up, but overall a really good item."
4,Just what I needed,"I ordered this blanket because I wanted something that sand wouldn't cling to easily on the beach. This blanket was perfect. We used it on grassy areas on the way down to give my 10 month grandson a crawling respite from his car seat. Then we used it every day at the beach. I loved the large size and the fact that sand would shake off of it. I was concerned about washing it since the company recommended a commercial washer but decided to go ahead and wash in my home washer. It came out perfectly. I love the way it folds up easily and to a carriable size. This was just what my family needed on our trip! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because some debris does stick to the velcro as some other reviewers have mentioned, but it is not much and it washed off great. It never interfered with the folding of the blanket."
5,Very nice,"I found this blanket on a babycenter store and decided to purchase it from here because of the free shipping. I got it fast and I loved it! It looks like an expensive bag and when you open it , it is a big blanket which is very soft inside and waterproof outside. it is easy to wash and carry around! It is a very nice blanket and we love to go for a pick nick or just relax on teh nature with our baby."
4,Great waterproof blanket!,"This blanket was larger than I thought and very sturdy. It is waterproof, so even though my 3 month old and I were on damp grass, it didn't soak through at all! It isn't a soft 'blanket' but more like a flexible and comfortable mat. I am glad I bought it and use it often."
5,Best picnic blanket ever!,"I absolutely love this blanket! Here are some of the reasons why. It is:- Large enough to fit my 6'2'' husband, 3 year old son, and me.- Waterproof, sandproof and stainproof. Perfect for a picnic, at the beach or with kids who tend to spill stuff.- Comfortable because there is a cushion pad which makes it bearable to sit on the ground for long periods of time.- Portable since it folds up and you can carry it around with the shoulder strap. There is also a little pocket to store slim items in.- Works very well as a play mat for babies and toddlers.- Beautiful. I love the patterns and the colors. It isn't frumpy looking like other picnic blankets I've seen.I highly recommend this blanket over all others!"
2,"Good quality, but...way too small","I bought this blanket based on other customer reviews, after a summer-long search for the perfect picnic blanket. While it is well made, reasonably priced, and much nicer looking than other blankets out there - it's WAY too small. I take up the entire thing if I'm lying down on it in the park. If another person is there, forget about it - half of our bodies are on the grass. I'll probably use it at the beach if anything, and will keep it on hand as a spare blanket, but plan on looking for a larger one for next summer."
2,"Like it, but the smell is very strong.","The blanket has very strong plastic smell. I've left it out on the balcony for 4 days, but I can still smell it. Hopefully the smell will eventually go away."
1,Not waterproof,"This mat is just ok. Yes it folds nicely but I learned the hard way that this is NOT waterproof in any way. We went to the park and the grass was a little damp, after a few minutes I realized that my pants were all wet!!! I cant return it now so it will have to do for the beach or wherever its completely dry."
2,Gray/Green Color Option Does Not Have Gray Colors,"If the colors are important to you, note that the Gray/Green color blanket, contrary to the zoom image, does not actually have any true gray fabric colors in it. The photos are so off it's perplexing, let alone misleading. The solid outer fabric color is practically army green. For the inside lining, the darker stripes aren't dark gray in color, but chocolate brown and the lighter gray stripes are actually olive green. The orange is however orange."
5,4 years of using it and still love it,"I bought this blanket when my first baby was born - 4 years ago. I used it for my baby's tummy time, took it to the beach numerous times, then I used to protect my bed from my daughters night time accident. Now I have my second baby, it is again used as a play time mat-tummy time mat. I guess I am supposed to wipe clean, but every time it needs to be cleaned, I just throw it in the washer and hang dry. I washed it countless times and it still looks good. Color has not faded, no ripping, it might have lost a little bit of shape, but it looks like I can use this for couple more years. I love this blanket. I would highly recommend it and I would buy it again when I need a replacement."
1,Stinky chemicals!,"Not sure why this has gotten so many positive reviews. I can't imagine anyone would miss the horrible smell coming off this product. I have been trying to air mine out for a few weeks now and it still fills our entire spare room with a kerosene smell, this is after leaving it outside for a few days. I'm afraid to put my baby on it. After all, her nose will be only a few inches above the gasses that are coming out of this thing. Very cheaply made, and another reviewer said it's not even water proof. Don't buy the hype- looks good in the pics but not in real life."
3,"good, but too small","the quality is very good, so i give 5 starts for quality. but, i have to give 3 stars for the size.now that i'm really thinking about it, a picnic blanket must be minimum of 6 ft so you can lie down without your feet going over. (assuming you are not taller than 6 ft)having said that, they clearly say it's 5x5 ft so it's my fault for not thinking this through. maybe they can make a 6 x 6 size?"
4,Blanket,Hard for me to give a review because I haven't used it yet. Delivery was fast and I do look forward to using it and not having grass and dirt stick to it. Love the pattern.
1,Gray/green blanket,"This ""blanket"" was not a blanket at all. It is definitely waterproof, but I would have liked to see that top of it be more comfortable. Also the gray/green blanket l"
3,Costly postage,"This item was ordered in early Nov. It did not arrive until Dec. 5.The postage due was $21.95. I did not expect to have an extra postage charge, esp. such a large one"
5,AWESOME!,This blanket is amazing!!!! It's way bigger than it looks in the photo. I got the brown with blue bubbles and it is so pretty! The top is so silky and smooth. And the bottom is totally like a thick mat. I can see why people would say they could use it on concrete.I used it in the backyard today for my 10 month old and he loved it. I felt better about sitting on this with him than a different blanket or a large towel that could soak through or feel the grass pokies.It is AWESOME and such a great great deal!! I'm sooo glad I got this rather than the tuffo one.
5,"so easy to carry, clean, fold!","I purchased this blanket when I took a cross country trip with my 8 month old baby. It was the perfect thing to spread out on our rest breaks and let my daughter crawl around. It is thick and durable, and brushes off perfectly. When we got home I used it to bring my not-walking-yet daughter outside to the lawn, and even by myself I could hold my baby with one arm and unfold/refold this blanket with my free hand without any trouble. Now it is the only blanket we take to the beach, and the sand just rolls right off when we're done. My husband, my baby and I can all sprawl out on it without feeling crowded. I love this blanket. It folds up to a purse-sized object that just slings over my shoulder for easy carrying. I have the brown and pink one, which is gorgeous. I highly recommend this product."
4,Good quality but a little too heavy,"I like this blanket so far, the quality is good only it is a little too heavy."
5,great blanket,it's not giant but for my 2 and 4 year old it is just right as a play mat on a tile floor. it's easy to spot clean. it's easy to fold up and nice looking.
3,Nice product,"I wouldn't exactly call this a ""blanket;"" it's more of a pretty tarp. It is somewhat stiff and slippery. I needed to wash mine on ""sanitary"" due to an accident, and it's water repellancy wore off. It is likely good for picnics, but just don't expect something that you can snuggle up with or that can withstand a tough washing. I am sure I didn't follow manufacturer's washing instructions, but I mention just in case someone else needs to put it through a tough washing."
5,"if you have kids, you must get","Greatest invention, if you go to the park, have picnics or just need a blanket for your lawn - get this. We love ours, have 2 when going on vacation - so handy with the shoulder strap."
5,Perfect size & function!,"I love this. It folds up very well into itself into a carrier pack, has convenient pocket for extra items (I toss a book, my phone and keys in), looks good, is a great size and adds just enough cushion while providing a waterproof area to sit on. I keep it in our car and have found opportunities to use it I otherwise would not have noticed w/o having a blanket to use. I often grab it for little walks to the park with my 18 month old (I wear her in my Ergobaby carrier & am 8 months pregnant - so obviously it is an easy size to manage!) to sit on - plenty big enough for us to both hang out on and keeps us both dry (it seems to rain overnight here often). I wish I had purchased it sooner!"
3,Ehh.,Nice and thick for a beach but honestly save you money and just use a big blanket you already own.
1,Size description is not accurate,"This blanket is not 5' by 5'. Maybe diagonally, but I believe that type of measurement is reserved for televisions. This was a gift and I was going to buy another one for myself. I'll keep looking."
4,Great outdoor blanket,I love this blanket! It's easy to tote around and folds up easily! Great for outdoors because of the water resistance and material they use. The only thing that was just ok was the color but it was cheaper than the others so I didn't mind
4,Great blanket - but a little small,"Awesome blanket - everything everyone has said about how easy it is to clean, easy to fold up, how it's a little heavy and well padded is true. I bought the grey/green one - colors look great - the picture doesn't give it justice! The only down side is that it is a little small. My husbands feet dangle off the end of the blanket...we can't all (2 adults and baby) lie on it and relax...wish they made it bigger."
3,Not great,"It is a nice sturdy blanket, but unfortunately it is way to heavy to carry around or to strap to the stroller. Also after using it 3 times the strap broke. Very disappointed!"
3,Not as water resistant as you might think,"This does not hold up to a very damp ground. Not sopping wet, very damp andthe moisture came through to soak me where I was trying to avoidgetting wet, hence, by using the blanket. So I was disappointed andcalled JJ Cole because I thought I might have gotten a ""bad"" one..They told me it was true, it won't hold up to those conditions becausthey use a breathable fabric... But I kept it anyways!"
3,"Blanket is great, but I had to air it out for days",I love the blanket... but... it had this very strong scent of petroleum or something? Smelled like gasoline. I believe it was the waterproofing that made this smell. I am airing it out on the deck... it's been out there 3 days and the stink seems to be gone =) Phew!
4,a stylish tarp,"this is pretty much a padded tarp with its own carrying case. it's convenient to use. it can fit in a standard washer, but only air dry it. out-of-the-box it did have a strong chemical scent to it, thus the need to launder it."
4,Good blanket to have available,"I haven't had this blanket long, but have already used it a couple of times. The size is nice for 2 adults and 1 little one to use. It folds up and packs very nicely. I wouldn't pay a lot for it (since my closet is full of other blankets), but think it is worth the price that I paid."
5,Great blanket!,"I absolutely love this blanket! It's great for sitting out on the grass because no dampness ever seeps through the bottom. Also, the top is soft and easy to clean. This product is exactly what I expected, and I couldn't be more pleased."
5,Very cool setup!,"Purchased this for my Europe trip... it looks cool, is compact, unfolds and folds nicely! It'll even work great for the beach (I live in Florida). For around twenty bucks, it's a steal."
4,"good blanket, smell fades","I purchased this blanket to use with my 6 month old outside in the grass and as a travel blanket for the beach. The blanket did have a strong smell when we got it and I had to leave it out and open for about a week but the smell faded and now there is no smell at all (about 3 months later with moderate use). It is very handy, a decent size and easy to clean minor spills and messes by wiping the surface. The only downfall was that we needed to wait a while to use it until the smell faded. It reminded me of a new plastic shower curtain smell only not as stong. Now we love the blanket and use it in our yard almost every day. It provides a great place to put the baby so she is not directly on the grass (although now she often crawls off the blanket but thats not the blankets fault)."
5,Picnics,"Well I don't think they have used it yet, but they sure loved it! The quality is top notch and I am sure they will love it for their picnics, little bike trips and park outings. Gave these to many families - a great gift that will add to their outdoor fun."
2,"Cute,but way too small","I really wanted to like this blanket, but it's just too small. It's 5'x5' which barely fits one adult and 1 child. I need something a little bigger so that 2 adults and a child/baby can fit comfortably. It's a great color and the quality is good."
4,Nice blanket,"One of my friends had it, and she talked about it very highly. And when I looked, it was on sale so I bought it. This is a very nice blanket. We keep it in the trunk of our car, so we can use it when we go to a park. The great part of this blanket is you can wash it in the washer.Unfortunate part is the durable outer fabric is not waterproof."
5,Best baby item I bought!,"This blanket works great on wet grass or damp beach and is so so convenient. It's one of the best baby items I bought! Folds super easy, cleans up wonderfully -- highly recommend it for moms on the go! I keep this in my car and am always picnic-ready :)"
4,Love It!,I use this blanket about three times a week and it has been ideal. I used to have a similar picnic blanket that I got years ago from Crate & Barrel (which I lost) but it didn't fold up as easily into a messenger bag. I love that feature. My only concern: How to clean it. It only mentions wiping clean. That may not be enough and I don't think you can just toss it in a cold wash. That's my reason for rating it four stars instead of five.
4,the ultimate al martino -,'just what the doctor ordered.' ordered specifically for 'close to you.' lived up to expectations. 24 songs! ;-)
1,Disappointing,I was in Jamaica while reading this book. It was so disappointing to read when it was much more about the author than Bob Marley. I would give this book a half star.
4,A Great Story,Being a fan of Marley i found this book hard to put down. It tells the exciting story from Bob's managers point of view and shows insight to some of the songs giving you a new understanding of the King of Reggae. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to see Bob in a new way as it follows him from his early days until his death in 1981.
1,Bob Marley's Own Albert Goldman,"Man, this is the unreal story. This is a nasty thing done by a guy who lived off Bob, and then he tried to take bad advantage after Bob was gone. He's just like the writer Albert Goldman was with John Lennon, acting like a backstabber, trying to bury somebody he was jealousy of after he had passed. Nobody needs to bother with this thing, it's evil to the core."
