4,Great book!,"This is a good book for parents that like to do research on their own. I especially like that this book give you the standard treatment the doctor will recommened, vitamins and minerals to help certain conditions and herbs you can give. You can choose what you think is best for your little one."
3,"OK, but no real insight.","After I bought my ""coon"" I bought this book in hopesof finding out about this great and mysterious breed. The book reallydid not tell me anything that I didn't already know by researchingarticles on-line before I bought her. It did show pictures of alltypes of MC's that I never knew existed, but not what I wanted toknow. I wanted to know more about their quirkiness, etc. that makesthem so unique and fascinating. I actually find more info from otherowners on-line! But, for people who are just learning about MC's, thisbook is probably a good start."
2,Not worth the price,"As seems to be the problem with all books about specific breeds, this one also fails miserably. The first half is about the history of the breed. But the second half is very generic about cats in general. Pretty pictures. Don't waste the money on this book."
3,Good beginner book.,"Decent reference book, but as others have pointed out it is somewhat basic and definitely dated. If you were looking for a basic reference and find a used copy cheap, go for it! If you want an up to date definitive reference keep looking. We had our cats picked out when this arrived, and I found more recent breed info and photos online than this book provided. I still have the book and enjoyed the read."
5,excellent book,"It has been a while since the last time I read this book. I can't remember most of the content now. But how can I forget the joyness this book brought to me. The author really knew his stuff, and organized it very well from a view of history of this area."
4,Much Better Than Volume 1,"Don't be fooled by the mediocrity of the first volume ofPickin' on the Beatles; this volume is far more appealing and skillful (in my opinion) than the first.The classics are covered very accurately but with enough quality free form Bluegrass than it makes them new and interesting. If you are a fan of Bluegrass, it's very good. But if you are also a fan of the Beatles, it is great! I listen to it whenever I'm driving up on vacation to the Adirondacks, and it sets the simple-life, worry-free attitude perfectly!"
3,The Last Honest Woman,This was the first of the O Hurley novels I have read. Not sure I began with the best one.Probably need to begin with the first of them. Dont know which one it is.
3,The Last Honest Women,"The Last Honest Woman by Nora Roberts -- Nora never lets her readers down. Books are full of interesting people, great story lines, and some very interesting facts. Ms Roberts writes more than a romance book."
4,THE LAST HONEST WOMAN,"The Last Honest Woman was honestly one of Nora Roberts better plots. I love Nora don't get me wrong but there is a sameness to many of her plots. This TLHW was new and innocent. Elizabeth was a breath of fresh air and not like so many ""heroines"" for ever the same, gutsy but pliant, beautiful but never seem to know it.Yes it is a good read and although it is not new |I look forward to the trilogy."
2,"E-book equivalent to a ""chick flick"" movie!","I think the book is very well written, but I found it to be the e-book equivalent of a ""chick flick"" movie. Women readers will probably really like it, but the more I read the more I could feel the testosterone draining out of my body. Will leave Nora Roberts to my wife in the future."
3,A typical Nora Roberts,"I chose this rating because from the beginning it was evident that the ending was very predictable. I read Nora Roberts because of her interesting style and plots. What I liked was the addition of Lizzy the Ghost and the search for her Billy. It was enough of a good distraction to know how the end of the story would develop. That was the reasons for my reading the whole series. I would recommend this book to those who like a little romance, history and intrigue."
4,Very good,I enjoyed this book very much. Good story enjoyable to read would read more of this author and I have
3,New to Nora Roberts,"This is the first novel I have read by Nora Roberts. The storyline is good, but I cannot feel why these two characters are attracted to each other. Dylan is rude, angry, and possibly abusive since he grabs her, shakes her, and is just plain rude at times. I don't see where the attraction started for her. But the story is ok and I made it through the story."
1,Save Your Money,"As a major Ann-Margret fan always on the lookout for videos of her earlier work, this video was a tremendous disappointment. Her role is small, with perhaps 20 minutes of screen time, and her acting is at its histrionic worst! The story itself is all over the place, with strange incestuous/homosexual overtones that are heavily implied but never explored. The frigid school marm who is afraid of Bus' boxer shorts is the smartest one in town--she left the movie early on! Wish I did!"
4,Great EDC knife,"This is my 1st Benchmade. It is just the right size, quality construction, comes very sharp from the factory, opens so smooth and fast, quick release is awesome. Only issue I have is the paint on the pocket clip wears off easily but it's not a big deal. Buy one you 'll love it."
3,Good account of Baltic trouble,This is the only book about covert ops in the former yugoslavia that I have read. It is fast paced and very descriptive. For other great reads on the SAS try Andy McNab and Chris Ryan.
3,"Totally entry level, but not totally bad","I couldn't fit my whole review in this small space so here are the highlights. Keep in mind that I had the A1 system and not the A3. The components were definitely an upgrade from the cheap, lightweight home theater systems now selling under names like ""Koss"" at Target. Good Picture and sound. Good channel separation thanks to discrete 5.1 style set up (6 seperate plugs go to amp) Downside, no tuner, two remotes (one for dvd player, one for subwoofer/amp), no display to tweak audio volumes, cd's don't play in 5.1, no component video only S-video or RCA, speakers rates at 80 watts (460) but amp only powers 35 watts (235). Hopefully, SDAT has improved their product in later models."
5,One of Christian Rap's Golden Moments,"This album is easily worthy, personally it's the best rap cd I've yet heard to come out of the South."
5,Perfect pocket bible,"Even though this thing is tiny, I use it as my main bible. It fits snugly in my back pocket, and the wear that has formed on the leather gives it a sweet beat-up look (just discolorations, no tears or anything after 6 months of me beating on this poor thing). As with most ESV's, the text is too small, but I can forgive this one since the whole bible is small (unlike that journaling bible I wasted my money on!)"
3,Too small of font,"This is a very nice little Bible. However, the Amazon write-up did not say that the font size is only 6 pt. My aging eyes could not read it so I returned it."
3,"Great bible, weird color","This bible is a great compact reader. The size is wonderful, and the translation is lovely.The problem I have with this bible is the cover. In the pictures, it looks like a brownish red... almost a cognac. When I received the bible, it just looked red. While I know it's vain to care what color my bible is, if I read from it every day, I want it to be pretty. When buying, know that the color is more red than picture."
1,ESV thinline Bible,"This was a good quality Bible, but the print was so small I could not read it without a magnifying glass. I thought it would be a readable Bible. It was not."
4,Convient Size,"It is a nice bible. It is fairly inexpensive and I love the ESV translation. Its font is small but easy enough to read.Heads up if you by it, the photo looks like real leather but its not. My friend has a leather one like this and I thought I was buying that one but it isn't. It feels slightly cheaper in your hand. Not a huge deal but a little disappointing when I opened the box."
4,Pleased.,"I was looking for a small ESV Bible, and this certainly fits the bill. The imprinted cover design is beautiful, but the color is more of a deep burgandy than a deep brown. Just to warn any shoppers with bad eyesight, the ESV Compact Bible has extremely small print. Overall, I definitely recommend the product. It is an attractive Bible in a convenient size, with flexible binding and printed in the excellent English Standard Version."
3,Beautiful-but not readable!,"This Bible is absolutely beautiful!!However, The print is extremely tiny and hardly readable. I looked up a few of my favorite scriptures the day I received it and I my eyes hurt from just skimming. I should add that I do not wear glasses and have great vision.This Bible is great if you are looking for one that can fit in your diaper bag, purse or pocket and use only on Sunday. But for personal study I would recommend another ESV with larger print.To Him be all the glory forever and ever AMEN!!"
5,Wonderful Bible,"This Bible was a gift for my college age son. We both like the ESV version and the Bible is just the right size for him to bring to church on Sunday. I would love this size for myself to carry in my purse. The cover is soft and bendable and all in all, is a great Bible."
4,Baja,"Takes you back to the basics of Baja. If your into amatuer racing this would be the video for you! Only 48 minutes long, though."
5,great workout,"I think this is a great workout. If you stick with it, you will definitely see gym quality results"
4,"Some good, some mediocre","He's got a lot of talent, and this album has a very nice, mellow feel, even if a few of the tracks are a bit dull. Many of them, particularly ""She Rules the School"", ""Roadtrippin"", and ""Castle of Sand"" I think are actually really well done. I don't normally review music, but I feel like the other reviewer's bias might turn off potential listeners to an up and coming artist with a lot of potential."
1,This is a workbook,"This book is a workbook, not the Azar grammar reference book that used to be the same blue. The question is what happened to excellent grammar reference book? Is it the maroon book which also has a workbook with it? There are now so many Azar titles it's become quite confusing, and way too expensive to just take a shot in the dark and purchase a $45 book."
1,Returns,"El probema no es el libro, es la compania que lo distribuye. Yo lo devolvi y JAMAS me devolvieron el dinero. Les escribi y me contestaron una vez, he insistido y ya no me contestan. Para mi, son IRRESPONSABLES y poco serios, no recomiendo comprar .Kevin Tracy ,smalltownbooks,Esta es la persona que contacte y esta la empresa que distribuye el libro"
1,"love this product, but the selling info is misleading!","This item typically retails for $15-18, and this was listed as an 8 count - a $190 VALUE, on sale. What I got was not the usual larger pouch, but a sealed box containing 8 little tiny packets - single servings. Either they forgot the other 7 boxes, or they're misleading customers.I like this product, but not for this price."
1,BEWARE - THIS IS NOT FOR 2 PACKS ONLY 1 ~!!!,"The description says this is for 2 packages of Rainbow light protein powder. I only received one package. This is the response I was given....Dear Customer,Thank You for ordering with us.We are writing to let you know that there was a image discrepancy and amazon some times maps the product info with other sellers. The actual product is a single pack. But because of the discrepancy the image is shown as 2 pack. We shall update the amazon stores to correct this. The price which we have charged you is only for one pack. Please understand the present issue.We apologize for the inconvenience.Please let us know if you need any further assistance from us on anything.Thanking You,Herb Pro"
5,taste,Interesting that I must have very different taste than the other reviewer here. I love this stuff - tastes good - I usually drink it with rice milk and some ground flax seed. I like that it is made of real foods and has rice protein instead of soy which I do not digest well and is still non-dairy.
1,Not a good taste,"The product has good ingredients. Good range of vitamins, minerals, and fiber but the taste is not one I would recommend. I mixed it with 8oz of vanilla soy milk, it has a greenish tint, probably because of the spirulina in it. I wrote this review because as soon as I tasted it I thought I needed to let others know it is not palatable. Taste is subjective but I don't like it much."
5,Pretty good for allergen-free rice protein,"I cannot use protein shakes with dairy nor soy, and I don't like the ones made with hemp nor pea...so that leaves me with pretty much one choice: Rainbow Light Protein Energizer in vanilla.OK, the taste is not ""vanilla."" I can't describe what it is exactly, but it's pretty okay. They recently did an overhaul of the formula so that now it is creamier, sweeter and less grainy. I would say that it is better now.I like the greens in it and appreciate the protein and other stuff. I wish it had more calories per serving, but they've probably done the best they could for an allergen-free product. I am grateful Rainbow Light makes it for people like me with multiple food intolerances. Thanks Rainbow Light."
3,suddenly smaller space,"preparing to drastically downsize, i bought this book to assist in the process...didn't quite do it for me ,some of these spaces are actually rather extravagant in area, i suppose small spaces are relative to ones own living space at the time of putting together a book on the subject. i had in mind REALLY small spaces,still... in viewing what i couldn't consider in this book i have put together in my mind what i would embrace when the time comes to actually live in 'suddenly small surroundings' hmm! could be a title for my own book!..."
3,Metal fo sho,"I didn't realize this album was so heavily metal influenced. However, as I am usually not a fan of metal I take it as a new genre of music to experience. It's not the metal where you hear the lead singer screaming and such, it's Archer with his gorgeous voice surrounded by heavy guitars and drums. If I can handle it I think other people can too. It's perfect angry music. I totally listened to this album with an open mind....because I started out with Neon Golden and went in reverse with their albums."
3,Game rule interpreter needed,"My wife and I are fans of GWTW. We were on our honeymoon when the movie was first aired on TV. I saw this vintage game and bought it for her at Christmas. The product was very interesting but the game rules are NOT very user friendly. All in all, it will be a keepsake and add to our ""Windie"" collection."
4,Game Strategy guide,"Item in excellent condition. Came within estimated time, but longer than other items ordered the same day."
3,Nothing extraordinary,"Nice, but nothing to write home about. Good quality, but you could probably find something better for the money."
1,Swivel Bushing,"Purchased this product to replace my wore out seat bushing, looked well made, but I found the thickness was different and the seat wouldn't go back on. I'm glad it doesn't cost much."
3,3.5 stars Love and Hate It,"Chansons pour le corps is an invigorating piece in 4 movements. It is experimental and diverse enough (instrumental, singing, speech) that you find yourself engaged at every turn. My French is spotty, but I was drawn in all the way, alternately looking up some words on the internet and just letting the music wash over me when I got lost. When the piece ended, I wanted to listen again. That's the love it part. Et Si Tout is perhaps just too personal to the composer and experimental a piece for me to connect with. Again, if one is fluent in French, it might be better, but after loving Chansons, I didn't have the patience to endure this 35 min let down. Would I still buy the disc, given what I know now? Yes. Chanson and track 5 run a solid 40 min; I don't feel cheated. I just ripped the first 5 tracks to my computer and put the disc away. The limitations here are likely mine vs the composer's, yet I think most listeners would share those limitations."
3,no Jan Morris,"It is hard to top Bill Marsano's devastating review. I didn't find the writing that bad, but it certainly wasn't compelling. There is a certain laziness here. But I enjoyed the book anyway, because I was on vacation when I read it, and I love Italy. Two and a half stars to three stars is about right. So if you're in the mood for light fare, sort of like cold pizza, read Sicilian Odyssey. And Bill Marsano's comments about travel writing are dead on."
5,Partial Review,"I first heard selection #3 on a movie I watched called, Rowing with the Wind, starring Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley. The music was beautiful and haunting, and I couldn't forget it. When I looked for the soundtrack to the movie, I couldn't find one. This composer was mentioned, though, and his work. I can't wait to hear it again, and those of you who like this music should see the movie mentioned above. I am planning to rent it again."
5,"Beautiful, intelligent music","These guys are a great gem waiting to be discovered. I'm convinced it's only a matter of time before they hit it big.As musicians, these guys are extremely talented, showing mastery as multi-instrumentalists and writing beautiful songs the way it seems like no one writes them any more: songs in 3/4, songs with bridges, etc. (Great live shows, too.) Top that with some beautiful lyrics courtesy of lead singer Kevin May.""Told You So"" is a perfectly crafted pop song. ""Portmarnock Beach Boy Blue"" is a boogie-fest that ends before you want it to. ""I Think I Love You"" is a cute country-tinged song about the excitement of new love. ""Cold Truth"" has to be one of the most beautiful break-up songs ever written. And ""Tromboner"" sees Mick Lynch, usually the back-up vocal, singing the lyric exactly as a trombonist might play it.Pure genius, in a beautiful faux-leather cover. Don't wait, buy it today."
1,damage nails,"I bought this product (pink color) to make my nails strong. Well, after two weeks of use my nails did start peeling...not the polish...layers of the nail itself!!!! This is Sally Hansen and is the first product of this brand I have problems with...I strongly do not recommend... I'm using nailtiques now to recover my nails."
3,The Picture Is Incorrect...,"I was trying to order a micro hdmi to hdmi like the one that is pictured, but received a M/M hdmi, granted the description does not say it's micro hdmi, but now I have to order an adapter. Just beware, that you will not get whats in the picture."
5,Brazilian Portuguese. Use of Brazilain Portuguese in everyday context.,"This book is great and current! According to Brazilians it is very accurate and COMPLETE. For an intermediate/advanced student, ""Dicionario de Usos Do Portugues Do Brasil"", is a wonderful investment. Highly recommended!! (Note: there is NO English in the dictionary. ONLY PORTUGUESE.)"
3,A Tough Subject,"I bought this book because I was having such a difficult time with a similar book by Serge Lang, Undergraduate Algebra, and I needed to pass the course I was taking. This book did help. It was more understandable. Lang's book has no answers to exercises and this book has ""selected odd-numbered"" answers which, while better than nothing, was still not enough. This book sometimes omitted proofs by leaving them to the reader, but not nearly as much as Lang's book. It would also be better if this book followed the normal convention of presenting Groups then Rings instead of the other way around."
2,"Decent exposition, poor examples and problems","Most problems (especially those problems whose difficulty is classified as B or C) are not do-able and the examples are highly inadequate. I am getting by in my class by finding examples online.Also some parts assume previous knowledge. For example the textbook defines isomorphism as:(1) f is surjective(2) f in injective(3) f is a homomorphismThe US education system is totally abysmal. Most students in my class don't know what is surjective and injective, but the textbook assumes that you know them."
1,Not the best book for undergrads....,"This was the text used in both semesters of my undergrad algebra and I was really disappointed in it. The sequence we used was to start with rings and then into fields. During the first semester the instructor did an excellent job in making up for shortcomings in the text. The second semester (group theory) was a complete loss as I had both a bad text and a bad instructor. Joseph Rotman writes a FAR better algebra text, especially on the topic of group theory. I study algebraic topology and thank GOD everyday for Rotman!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I am studying certification examination and I bought this book for studying 4th examination. I have 3 books on Performance Tuning subject and this one is total disapointment. In the book you can only see many repetitions (I think writers put these in order to increase page count) and useless commends. I could not find any detailed information on subjects, only well known regular information on Oracle database. If you do not want to waste your money, DO NOT BUT THIS BOOK."
4,Good,I can tell you right now this is alot better then Lil Flip. I don't really know these guys but they do a good job holdin down on the mic.The Beats are above average and plus they dont talk as much about the rap cliches of today they just rap it sounds like Early Outkast and early B.G. There were a number of good songs off this album-watch for more from these guysLyrics-10/10 Production-8/10 X Factor-9/10 Classic-7/10 Replay-9Total=9 out of 10 Fingers-Nice
2,Not for me,"As part of the adoption triad, I was hoping for a book with 'meat', and instead found a very predictable book with foul language that had no reason to be in it. Prude? Maybe, but I do not enjoy it when it is there solely for 'show'....and it certainly had nothing to add to the story. I HAD been going to gift my adult daughters with the book, as one has searched and met her bmother and family, and the other has met a bsister...but, I can tell you that it is NOT worth buying more IMHO."
2,Disturbing Piece,"When I read the summary on the back cover I though this may make a good read, but I really had a hard time getting to enjoy the main character Sarah.I almost put this boring drivel down a quarter through, but I wanted to see what happened with Sarah's search for her birth mother; which ends up being very uneventful. I hate Sarah's cold personality and found the dialog between characters to be very calculated and unnatural. Newman tries to create a somewhat hip character but fails miserably, perhaps because Newman herself isn't hip? Anyway, this book is not worth buying at all and was a disappointment considering Newman's credentials."
4,"I'm not a speed reader, but I blew through this!","I haven't completed this book yet, but i have to say, WOW! something about the voice of the main character drew me in. I love this book. I couldn't put it down. I was thinking about it at work, before i went to bed, During Church, LOL. If I hate the ending, I'll change the star rating, promise!Great read!"
4,Hope it works,"Bought this for my sisters car but haven't installed it yet. I hope it works. It was a good price and as usual with Amazon Prime, it arrived very quickly. It looks pretty small and not like the picture but if it works, I'll be happy."
5,Kean - A piece of my past,"My dad was a huge music lover. He instilled this in me. Kean was the only Broadway cast album he ever bought.I heard it alot in my home and fell in the love with it, epecially the lush musical arrangements and Alfred Drake's amazing vocals.I lost my dad in 1985. I have the vinyl and I always considerate it a wonderful reminder of him. I was so thrilled to get the CD. The music sounds as fresh and beautiful as ever. A great CD and a great reminder of my Dad."
4,Funny and interactive,"My 18 month old recieved this book for her first birthday. At first she wasn't interested in it, but now she can't put it down. She can tell me before lifting the flap that the horse wears boxers and the turtle's underwear is purple. It is so much fun for her to read with someone, but she also sits alone and reads it to herself. She calls it her ""cow book"". The only downfall is that the flaps are somewhat flimsy (although, she is 18 mos and would probably tear anything!)and she has torn many of the flaps. I am sure an older child could take better care of the book."
5,So cute and educational!,"This book is adorable. It teaches children rhyming words along with poking fun at different styles, color and texture of underwear. It really keeps the kids giggling...and the suprise ending is a laugh out loud experience for both children and adults!"
4,Better Sound Than Live Album but The Concert is Not Quite as Good,"""Live - The 1971 Tour"" has much better sound than Live Album and a terrific rockin version of Footstompin Music but the concert isn't as good as Live Album and not quite as much energy - was never a big fan of Hooked On Love and Get It Together and Live 1971 really could use ""In Need."" Note: the live version of ""In Need"" on the new Closer to Home album is awesome and much better than the one on Live Album. Still recommend Live 1971 slightly over Live Album due to the better sound quality here."
3,Takes you back to when guitars ruled the Earth.,A good record of a band firing on all cylinders.I must admit that I could have done without the lengthy drum solo though.Buy the Red Album first then this one.
4,Live and LOUD,"This captures Grand Funk at their primative beginnings...just before they began to noticibly polish their individual musical abilities. The energy, honesty, and intensity of their performance cannot be denied...unless you are comatose and on a ventilator. The performances on this CD are an interesting comparison to the BOSNIA CD which captures the energy of the live performance...with much more polish....30 years after The 1971 Tour."
3,Where is Time Machine??,Good CD but why repeat most of the tracks from Live Album??? Where is Time Machine??????
2,Okay after Inside Looking Out,"I liked everything starting with ""Inside Looking Out"" (song 8) to the end of the CD.But the ""I'm your captain"" medley everyone else raves about is the worst version of this great classic to ever see the light of the laser! They sound completely burned out on playing this medley. ALL songs from hea Staadium ""suffer"" - surely there are some better renditions out there _somewhere_...... The 1975 Live CD or the 1999 ""Bosnia"" CD are MUCH more listenable."
3,Wait a Minute Guys,"It may have to do with memory , sequence , songs , details in the recording , etc ... but this has nothing to do with Their Live Album of the same time and space , which is just Fantastic ... The sound is just okey , the ... it`s not the same ... Just gave it away and ordered the Real Thing ... Not worth It ..."
4,4 1/2 stars ADVENTURE RACING IS NEAR PERFECT!,"THERE ARE SIX LONG TRACKS TO RACE ON. I'VE ONLY SEEN FOUR.. COVENTRY COVE, MOUNT MAYHEM, INFERNO ISLE & SUNSET SANDS. THE TRACKS I HAVE YET TO PLAY ARE.. METRO MADNESS & WICKED WOODS. MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS RACING GAME. IT IS WELL MADE, NICE LOOKING & EASY TO CONTROL. YOU MUST BEAT THE INDIVIDUAL TRACKS ON CHAMPIONSHIP MODE FOR THEM TO APPEAR ON SINGLE RACE & TWO PLAYER MODES. I LOVE THE BOOST BOXES, THE SHORT CUTS, THE CAMERA OPTIONS & BEETLE BATTLE MODE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A QUAILITY RACING GAME AT A NOW AFFORDABLE PRICE.. ""BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING"" FOR YOUR N64 IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE."
5,Way overlooked,"This game was my favorite game for maybe a year when I was younger. The graphics are about average for a n64, but it is way more fun than the average n64 game.You have about 5 or 6 different fun/funny levels, and you can unlock different beetle's(including the tye dye alien bug).I spent more hours on this than I would normally admit to, and would recomend it to any racing genre fan."
5,Best even for novices...,"I am not a nintendo player, but when my little brother got a N64 system earlier this year, i insisted on getting this game. it is easy ehough even for unskiled players, and yet fun and involving for advanced users. I love it!"
4,one of the best 64 games made,"I recently picked this game up used, and I am glad I did. Despite the fact that the Nintendo 64 seems like an antique system, this is one of those well-done games that stands the test of time.Basically the only 2 games I have been playing are the PS2 titles Hawk 4 and Vice City. But since I picked up Beetle Racing, that one has racked up quite a bit of playing time as well. For Beetle to be compared with those 2 games must tell you something.Despite the gimmicky-appeal of the new Beetle being the centerpiece for a video game, make no mistake, Beetle Racing succeeds in every way possible. The graphics, play control, fun factor, sound, and replay value all measure up, even against the newer products on the market.You may have a difficult time finding this game since the 64 is an obsolete system, but if you do, pick it up."
1,Beetle Adventure Racing,"This is the worst game I have ever played. it is so boring. My son got it on his ninth birthday party and his friends hate it too. Please I would like a refund for this game. I can't even believ that you would actually sell a game like that. I am just ready to scream, that game ruined my sons birthday party, now he has no friends. I can't believe you. Whoever sold my that game should be fired."
4,Great fun!,"This game is a blast. If you race someone who is at the same level as you, then you really have a challenge. You can race alone with the machine and it is alot of fun.It has great graphics and the scenery is beautiful. It has short cuts and different weather conditions and tracks. Place 3rd or better and move to the next track, eventually you will get to do space trucking and earn cars as you win races. Our family really enjoys it. We range from 8 years old to 49! This game is ageless."
4,good book for younger children,"My daughter of 7 enjoyed my wife's anatomy books and this book was a nice, at her level, book that complimented the college level books."
5,Wonderful storytelling,I bought this disc directly from Paul at a showand thoroughly enjoyed it on the trip home. Paul has a wonderful way with words and makes you feel like the events in the songs happened to you. I plan on giving a few copies as gifts this year.
4,Great,I know these guys are popular somewhat- but im amazed that they are not REALLY popular- why the hell do bands like slayer and cannibal corpse get so popular? No clue- This is some great Death/prog Metal- OPeth freakin rocks hard
4,An anthem of Metal,"This album is quite good, not one of my favorites, but has 2 songs that are an anthem for metal music, one is the record selftitle Blackwater Park, and the other is Patterns in the ivy part II"
3,wtf?!?!?!?!?!,"dude- i love opeth, and i love blackwater park- why do freakin bands have to reissue cds with extra tracks??? i swear- this is starting to piss me off. MONEY MAKING MACHINE!!!! GA!"
5,"Contrast, Balance, Variety","I'm new to Opeth, this is the first cd of theirs that i've picked up, and i'm extremely impressed. Opeth has demonstrated the perfect balance between heavy, dirty riffs, and a soft, clean arpeggio styled riffs. As well, they've found an amazing middle ground between death metal screaming and actual singing. It's tough to explain, but this album was 100% not what I expected, but also 100% great. The songs are LONG, which is refreshing and appreciated considering too many songs now average less than 3 and half minutes. You get your moneys worth with this album if not more. It bridges the gap between excrutiatingly heavy and clean all too well, in guitars and vocals without the songs blending into eachother. A must have."
5,Another Great Opeth Album!,"I have Ghost Reveries, Still Life, Deliverance, and My Arms, Your Hearse in addition to Blackwater Park. Every single Opeth album I have is excellent and well worth it. Opeth is downright mesmerizing, and Mikael Akerfeldt has the best death metal growl in the business. The highly skilled band members can be brutal, but they also take you on a journey. If you are into this style of music, Opeth is VERY fulfilling."
4,Good stuff - extra tracks worth it,"These Swedish prog-metal masters/closet folkies are a breed apart and a cut above just about any band that might get mentioned in the same breath. The two extra tracks on the deluxe edition -- ""Still Day Beneath the Sun"" and ""Patterns in the Ivy II"" are good examples of the band's alter ego: acoustic guitars, pastoral themes and quiet vocals. Mikael Akerfeldt can sing sweetly and growl nastily with equal effect. Tunes such as ""Harvest"" and ""The Drapery Falls"" betray the South American roots of Opeth's rhythm section, which can swing in 6/8 time as adeptly as it can rock out in the more traditional 4/4."
5,MaCally External Battery,I left the country on vacation and I was able to keep both of my I-pods fully charged the entire time. This product far exceeded my expectations. I do recommend that additional cables be included with the initial purchase.
1,sucked,Suked it was the woorst thing i have bot oon amazon and it doesnt workDont by it it is really bad and suky
2,I have two; both dead after 2 years,"I've used them off and on for 2 years, they worked well although the interface was sometimes annoying: it has an on-off switch that you need to remember to turn off or else it won't charge, and there's no indication that you've accidentally left it on. Meanwhile it has a ""check the charge"" button that only works if it's on. Etc. Nothing major but frustrating given how simple it *should* be.Now the real problem is that neither of mine will charge any more. They were both bought in 2008 and have been ""abused"" since then, charging multiple phones and occasionally overdrawing the USB power (at which point it shuts down until you plug it back into a wall) but this seems much too short of a lifetime."
2,Good while it lasted,"We initially thought this was a good product. It provided enough power to keep two iPods going through coast to coast flights and back, with connections and a long weekend thrown in. Great. We've used it fewer than 10 times. Now it won't take a charge at all. Very disappointing reliability. We are switching back to a much cheaper product that uses regular or rechargeable AA batteries."
3,short and techie,"All of 502 words! Very techie and will not be of much use to the foodie out there. Good information of fact, but would more useful if it had more real kitchen advise."
4,Surprised me--I never knew about this Navy!,"I purchased the book as a gift for my father. Before I saw him, I picked it up, and read it in a very short time. Frankly, I was completely unaware of this aspect of the war. It almost seems as though the Confederate Navy was successfully battling the mighty Union Navy with only chewing gum, shoe strings, and cast-off wood. This was a very interesting book. The chapters are well written and easy to follow, and are written in an exciting and reader engrossing style. No technical language is necessary to understand or follow the descriptions in this book. It includes both interesting background information about key officers, and descriptions of the battles themselves. My father also liked it!"
3,"Great Nipple, but I Switched Bottles","If you like Dr. Brown's bottles, these are great nipples. My baby had an easy transition from level 1 to these level 2 nipples. However, I eventually went back to using Playtex drop-ins and then the Nuk bottles---because I could not tell a difference in his gas/fussiness with the Dr. Brown's. I know people who swear by them, but they didn't make a difference for us, and they are such a pain to clean.These nipples are probably the softest silicone ones you can find, so that's a plus. But my baby loves the Nuk nipples, and he does just as well or even better with those bottles as he does with Dr. Brown's (and Avent made him super gassy)."
3,you know ...,"While the title sounded promissing ... the characters are just not as developed as in such superior films of the nude genre as 1997's ""Nude Cigar Smoking"" or 1996's ""Nude Fighting Girls.""Overall it is a let down ... but the food did look good enough that it might inspire a barbeque purchase."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Vantage Point doesn't have much going for it aside from the fact that it's not actually that bad; it's very forgettable and certainly doesn't offer any deep political insights, but it's a watchable thriller with a neat gimmick so you could do worse."
1,My Goodness,"What a god-awful movie. I thought I would love it from the opening 15 minutes, but at the end I was incredulous. How did the director not understand that even the most of optimistic of bad guys would have to laugh at the devilish plan. Although I would like the mastermind's cell phone. Operating a sniper rifle from your cell phone? A major dream of mine... Good grief."
3,Did NOT happen this way.,"Nah...Spanish cars don't have airbags, bullets don't kill people except when they do, getting smashed between a truck and a brick wall only makes you limp a little, terrorists who kill without qualm have a qualm, older heavy guys can run long distances without lactic acid buildup or breathlessness, terrorists with a vast network and apparently limitless technology rely on a suicide bomber rather than a placed bomb at the same location, and on and on. We don't know WHY certain people act as they do--for instance, why do the terrorists want to kidnap rather than kill the President, why does a certain person switch sides--but apparently that's not the point.And speaking of points, does it bother anyone else that ""Vantage Point"" means a particular place something is viewed, and not a character's point of view? Surely the movie should have been called ""View Point"" but that doesn't sound as cool...which is exactly the problem with this movie."
3,Not great...but not bad either,"You have seen this story a hundred times. One event told from several viewpoints until a cohesive story takes shape. The only problem with this one is that by the time that happens, you don't really care anymore. It has some okay action scenes including a pretty cool car chase at the end but other than that it is predictable and features viewpoints from a couple of characters that we couldn't care less about."
4,Good But Is As Expected,This is what was expected of this kind of movie. I hate to use the word typical.
3,BLUE RAY - VANTAGE POINT,"Although it says that this blue ray is region free, it does not open easily on both my Sony Playstation-3 my Sony Region 2 Blue Ray Player, Model #BDP-S1E .Vantage Point [Blu-ray]"
2,stop remaking the classics!,"A mediocre drama that does yet another spin of Akira Kurosawa'sRashomonidea. Vantage Point not only fails miserably, but it becomes melodramatic, formulaic, with a traditional Hollywood happy ending. What a strong political statement this movie could've made; what a bore it was instead!"
2,dragging movie,"i bought the movie because my friend said he really liked it at the theater. I'm guessing he fell asleep through half of it. Its extremely dragging, they tried to put a lot of twists, but they just turned out to be really lame. Watching the same video eight different times (except for a little difference at the end) has never been a style in playing movies, simply because its annoying and it sucks."
4,Groundhog Day on Steroids!!!!,"Vantage Point is an ingenious action thriller surrounding the attempted assasination of the U.S. President attending an international conference in Spain. The movie is actually 'about"" 15 minutes but is seen from the ""vantage point' (sorry) of about six different people. Each perspective presents a tad more about the swirling espionage associated with the conference until you realize that nothing is what you thought it was (AT ALL) in the beginning.Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to dwell on the supposed GLARING shortcomings of the film. I suspect some ""critics"" are conditioned/programmed to be oh so discerning that they can't see the forest for the trees - this was a thrilling, action-packed, and rather clever way of looking at an intense incident and is an excellent example of the age-old adage that truth is relative. Six people can look at exactly the same thing and see six different things.Fun movie. Great action flick. I indeed recommend."
4,A good fast moving action flick,"I wanted to see Vantage Point since it came out in theaters, but I never got the chance. Maybe that was a good thing because while this movie has its points I don't feel that it is as a complete story line as it is made out to be. The best way that I can describe this movie is when you are unwrapping a present in a big box, and then you find a smaller box inside of the larger box and so on. That is how this movie is, times 6, because of the 6 different vantage points that the film is based on. Not until you get to the last box that you are unwrapping do you see how all of the parts fit together, and that is really what spins this movie. There is plenty of action which keeps this films constantly moving, and one thing that I did like is when each vantage point is rolled back and the time starts over. I felt that when I was watching it the replays told the viewer that the vantage point was starting over which made the movie easier to follow."
4,Not for the single sighted...,"Great movie all about how things really are and how they can be percieved by the Vantage Point of those involved, those who are dragged unknowingly into, and those surrounding a situation or series of situations. Really keeps you on your toes. It's like a ""find the differences between the photos"" only on film. Loved it"
3,Improves as it goes along,"The plot thickens in this action thriller. The gimmick is we see the same 15 minute sequence about 7-8 times, each time through the eyes of a different character in a Spanish city where the US president comes under a terrorist attack. The terror plot is all too plausible. Let's hope no one gets any ideas from this. Most of the actors are fine and the dialogue is ok. Only Forest Whitaker is a bit too hapless as the American tourist who accidentally films everything on his video cam. A normal person would be cowering under a bush after shots were fired and a huge bomb goes off. But hey, it's Hollywood.."
3,"ENTERTAINING, BUT OH SO CONTRIVED","This is perhaps the most contrived film in history. It's a thriller along the lines of Crash, but more disjointed, and not nearly as satisfying. Dennis Quaid plays a Secret Service agent responsible for helping to protect the President during a War on Terror summit in Salamanca, Spain. But things go wrong: the President is shot, a nearby hotel is bombed, and finally the podium area of the summit is bombed. By replaying the final 25 minutes leading up to these events, numerous times, the filmmakers piece together the various people involved from different vantage points. It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes. Only Forest Whitaker's performance raises this film above the average - that and a very good chase scene with Quaid. Waitsel Smith"
2,Ground Hog Day meets The French Connection,"This film recycles the same event over and over, each time adding a tiny plot twist burried in repetitive material. Each recycle starts with a clock dispay a la Ground Hog Day - all that's missing is the radio playing ""I've Got You, Babe"" and a little entertainment value. After they have recycled the same event to death and you are ready to hit the stop button if they show that darned clock one more time, they move on to a car chase that just goes on, and on, and on, as the excitement gradually fades into fatigued boredom. Do yourself a favor and skp this one."
5,What's happening now!,"Great movie! Dennis Quaid is super. This movie shows how many people see different things from their vantage point. It also gives you an inside look as to how terrorists or any terror group works to get their job done, even to die to get their job done. Although this is fiction, there are many possiblities that could be true. The movie gives you something to think about and to be alert and aware of your surroundings."
2,Cute idea gone wrong,"This really should have been a 45 minute movie. The constant rewinding was annoying and then toward the end there were scene where you're wondering who Point of view you're looking at, because the one is should be isn't in the scene. Then one guy took that many secret service men out at the hotel? Yeah, right. The high speed car chase was most exciting part of the film. Watch at your own risk."
1,"awful, horrible and waste of money",Horrible movie and acting. Horrible story line and worse its political message makes me puke every time I hear about this sorry movie. Forest Whitaker is so bad in this movie I can't believe it. Anti-American BS is all over this movie. Outrageously cheap and bad. Zero Star!
1,Couldn't wait for end.,Not so good. Film shows same event over and over for different points of view. By the end I did not care what happened and was just glad for it to end. It was a lot of waiting for nothing (or not much). Didn't care about characters and just not that interesting. No meat. I would recommend renting/buying another film. BP
2,A movie of circles,"I was disappointed in this movie. If I had known that it was an event as seen over and over by different characters, I would NOT have bought it. When I saw Dennis Quaid I immediately sent for the movie because I had never seen a ""BAD"" movie with him in it. Well, I have now !"
3,definitely OK,"This is about a terrorist plot carried out in Spain. We get to see only a little bit of the truth at a time to help determine what happened and who was responsible.While it is slightly frustrating to see some of the same scenes over and over from different ""vantage points"" it also keeps you involved until the final reveal.The last 20 minutes or so is an all out chase scene through the streets.Definitely worth watching on a quiet afternoon at home."
2,Jumping and skipping!,"We were hoping to find this movie to rent in our small town, but no luck. I searched on Amazon and was excited to see we could rent it through the site. We opted to watch it online rather than downloading it to our computer. We have high-speed internet, but there was nothing high-speed about our viewing experience. While the sound was smooth and continuous, the movie jumped, skipped, stopped, got all pixelated, etc, through the ENTIRE movie. We stopped and backed up a few times in case there were any buffering issues - not too techno savvy myself, but that didn't work anyway. We'll think twice about renting another Amazon movie. Maybe we should have done something differently, but there wasn't much help during the ""rental process"" or ""check-out"" to give us any advice."
3,"PETE TRAVIS, OPUS 1","*** 2008. Directed by Pete Travis. Salamanca, Spain. The American president has invited his Arab and Western colleagues to sign a much advertised anti-terrorism treaty. During the final ceremonial, the president is shot and a bomb explodes in the crowd. If the multiple points of view form of the movie pleases at first because it requires from the viewer an active involvement and provides some intellectual satisfaction, the device reaches soon its limits because it leads to the discovery of a plot seen a hundred times on our TV sets. So, if you're simply looking for a 90 minutes thriller, VANTAGE POINT could satisfy you but for those who'd like more meat around the bone, skip it. Already forgotten."
2,It's a test.,"If you watch this and get to the 30 minute mark, and don't know who the traitor is, you fail. Or you are young. You need to watch more movies. Clue, a big red flag waving= a big star small role. You ask ""What's he/she doing here? Probably being bad. What a waste of a lot of talent. Bad car chase. Doesn't traffic exist?"
4,"Not bad, if you can tolerate the ""groundhog day""-like scenes","Dennis Quaid did a great job!! The only issue I had with this movie was the ground-hog day like repeats of each scene (the movie shows the perspective of all the major players, so you get to watch it up until the explosion each time, then it rewinds, starts at the pre-explosion scene, and moves forward from the next person's perspective). Overall, this was an action-packed movie with never a dull moment."
4,Haters Gonna Hate,"This movie was great, why is the guy reviewing this film from amazon so hateful??? Come on man this film is awesome..."
3,Vantage Point review,"Despite the fact that I just gave this movie 3 starts, I actually was a little bit disappointed after seeing it. I guess that I just honestly thought that it was going to be just a little bit better. But still, overall it was a pretty good movie, and I really enjoyed watching it, and even bought it! I would definately have to say that the best part of the movie was the incredible choices of actors they used, this was the whole reason that I watched it in the beginning. So as stated above, I would give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars."
2,i am glad i rented this first,another great cast with a terrible storyi am so glad i rented this movie and didnt buy iti dit not like this film and had such high hopesvery dissapointedthis may have been the worst action movie that i have seeni will def be not getting this movie on blu rayits def not any of the bourne moviesor even shooterthose are action moviesagain loved the casthated the movie
4,Good for 1 or 2 viewings,"In Spain, the President of the United States is assassinated. This movie replays the story several times from the vantage point of different people. A tourist, a secret service agent, and the terrorist, are all followed through the events and we see how the story unfolds from the pieces of the puzzle they give us. This is a pretty good movie. I don't think it's one you want to take up space at your house, but it's definitely worth renting. It's suspenseful and entertaining. This movie makes me think. Why is it that most of the President's that have been assassinated didn't deserve it? Why are the one's that deserve it left untouched and loved by so many? Anyway, this is an action packed thriller that is worth watching once or twice."
2,FLASHBACK OVERDRIVE,"The flashback redo from another point of view sometimes works good, if it is not overdone, like it was in this movie. Sigourney Weaver gives a very convincing performance as a news producer. When the reporter was knocked to the ground and appeared to maybe be dead, who was filming her for the news? Isn't there some point where the camera man must put the camera down and help out?This would have been a great movie had they simply did the thing with a plot and subplot in a chronological sequence, focusing on the character of the secret service agent, rather than play ""Groundhog's Day"" with it. Dennis Quaid? That was the best they could get? The flashback redo sequence served no real purpose. This would have been an even better film if a rouge Jason Bourne was the guy who came in and saved the President and then slipped out.PARENTAL GUIDE: No sex or nudity. 1 F-bomb."
4,Coign of Vantage,"Fete of DeathI rather liked the thriller ""Vantage Point."" The repetition of the movie's story from the different points of view of the main characters affords the movie a nightmarish quality. It's like you have to keep reliving a nightmare over and over making it that much more hellish, the tension mounting with each reliving. You feel trapped with no escape. You know what's going to happen and there's nothing you can do about it. The strands of the plot come together plausibly when the ambulance careens toward the little girl on the street, and in the ensuing violence and car crashes the story is resolved satisfactorily."
3,VANTAGE POINT,"The item was received in good condition. Delivery took an average delivery time frame. Packages well wrapped and packaged. Now a very brief, non-spoiling review of the movie. This is a pretty good movie. If you like the whole Secret Service type of genre; you will like this movie. Beware, the movie does the whole jumping back and forth thing during certain scenes; in an attempt to apply dramatization. Although this tends to bother me personally, it is still a pretty decent plot. I think they could have done slightly better with the movie if they didn't jump so much. All in all, it was pretty good. The Cast is great. A lot of familiar and favorite actors/actresses in this one. If you want to keep up with similar movies within the same genre; try out Shooter, or The Sentinel, both are pretty good too. Enjoy!"
5,Spectacular Film From Finish to Start,"This film is pure adrenaline from the moment it opens. I will not rehash the plot of the film, as some other reviews have revealed too much in the way of spoilers already. Solid and enjoyable. Quaid makes his mark and shows that he still has what it takes to be an action/drama hero. I can only guess that the negative reviews came from the pro-war crowd who were expecting the type of ""bang-em-up-shoot-em-up-kill-fest"" that Hollywood excels at stuffing down the gullet of the ignorant masses. If that is what you are looking for, Vantage Point is NOT your film. This is an EXCITING, thought-provoking, thrill-ride without the typical dumbed-down delivery. The film flows smoothly and is not forced in any fashion. The flashbacks add to the intensity and anticipation. The movie's message is clear in the final minutes, as all the pieces fall into place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,"Unlikely events, over and over","If the behaviors had been reasonable, I might have been able to put up with seeing them again and again. But they were not, and I sent it back to Netflix after about 20 minutes."
5,An Underrated Classic,"This recording, which once appeared on DG, is one of the underrated gems in the history of Lieder. Peter Schreier is at once delicate and forceful, his diction perfectly clear, his subtle phrasing supremely musical, and his deceptively simple interpretation perfectly suited to these wistful romantic songs. No one else comes close in this lovely material. Fischer-Dieskau and other baritones tend to crush them; female singers like Schumann and Bonney , while often lovely, sound insubstantial. This CD, at a bargain price, is something every lover of Lieder should own. I would take it to a desert island."
4,Great lounge trance CD,"I really like this compilation. Very professionally done, the music is smooth and sexy. Makes great background music. The two CD's are divided into ""bar"" and ""resturante"" with the bar CD being the more mellow of the two. Tracks combine both Spanish guitar rythems with French and North African electronica."
3,A Hint of Seduction,"After taking a spill from her horse on a dawn ride in the park, Catherine absconds with the horse that caused that spill. Although the horse's owner was less than copacetic regarding her version of borrowing, John, the Earl of Chatwin and one of the ton's most notorious bachleor's, is intrigued with the mystery lady. Soon, the gossip column is hinting at there being something more to the affair than it is, since the horse in question is John's most prized stallion. Though the earl never really wanted to marry, he begins to rethink things thanks to Catherine. There is just one tiny problem- he might be her brother.*** Fans of Regency romance will find this a comfortable read with most conventions of the genre observed. For a light and pleasant read, this will not lead you wrong. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"
3,A Nice Read!,"This was the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Grey and I found this read to be enjoyable but it did lack some charm revolving around various plot engines that had potential but fell short on delivery. The idea of using a ""gossip column"" to further a storyline is not a new one and Ms. Grey had fun with this aspect of the story. The problem that I had with the story was the storyline regarding Catherine (our heroine) and her search for her father. This story had great potential and did bring Catherine and John together but then fell flat and the outcome was less then satisfactory. This was truly the only part of the story that was a let down and the characters and the chemistry between the two was nice.Secondary characters add to the telling of the story and I look forward to reading Lord Dugdale's story and recommend this one as a nice way to spend an evening.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
2,Very small and not well made,"While the cross itself looks good, the size and craftsmanship are both poor. The size given by this retailer are with the bale (this should be made clear). I probably should have queried this fact.However, the Jesus on the cross is actually starting to fall off (one arm is coming off now) and I've had this approximately one month.I would not purchase this item or recommend at all.Cheers,R"
2,Not so great,"I have a 1 month old little girl who has colic, my 2nd child to have this awful trait. I couldn't find a bottle that fit her needs so I looked up these bottles and read all the reviews. They were so great I decided I would try them out. But what I found is that they are no different than any other bottle, at least for my little one. In fact, she never spit up until she started using these bottles. And the colic didn't disappear like some people say. No one knows what colic really is and what causes it, so maybe there are different factors to it and some babies did actually get better with this bottle. I just know mine didn't. I would try anything to stop her from crying, but these didn't work."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"After trying almost every bottle, I tried these and waht a nightmare! There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back@"
4,Better than the other bottles,I have tried the Avent and Playtex Natural Flow and this is the only bottle that has helped my over gassey and colicky son. He was less gassey immediately. The only annoying thing is cleaning all of the accessories every time you wash the bottle.
4,Using these bottles with rice formula,"My daughter has really bad acid reflux and someone recommended these bottles. They are great for formula. But due to the acid reflux her doctor started her on 1 tbsp of rice per oz of formula. She was having has a hard time sucking out the formula. It wouldn't go through the insert and it would get clogged up. So I tried to use the bottles without the insert but that caused the nipple to move and become loose and it would constantly leak. Removing the insert takes away the reason for the bottle, to help lessen colic and air bubbles. So if you are going to use this for plain formula I say go for it! Using rice, try another bottle."
2,not for every baby,"I had a terrible time finding bottles that had a TRULY slow flow nipple, and that would reduce baby's gas. These bottles may very well reduce gas, but the flow on the level 1 nipple is too fast for my baby and she gags! After much trial and error, we went with the Playtex VentAire instead and are VERY happy with them."
5,Start with the best!,These bottles are great!! My daycare center recommended them. I had about 30 Avent bottles. After trying Dr. Browns I replaced them immediately. My baby rarely spits up now and no more screaming with pain. A true lifesaver. Here is a cleaning tip: Buy the dishwashing baskets and place the tubes through the holes in the basket so they hang down in the dishwasher. It works like a charm!
5,a must for any baby with colic,"when my son went to the bottle and even before than he was soooooo colicky. i mean he literally cried all day and all night. i never slept. i was getting so depressed from not being able to help him and not sleeping. it was a nightmare for both of us. i literally tried every bottle in walmart. i tried every formula from generic to the most expensive alimentum which actually helped a little bit. my mother in law just so happened to give me a pack of these after finding out how much he was hurting and pulling his stomach in all the time and WHAT A MIRACLE!!! it was literally like a wonder bottle. i mean it. i wanted to kiss the man or woman who made these. i was so relieved to finally be able to get some rest and my little one was FINALLY able to drink his milk without crying immediatly afterwards. the thought of me not having to burst into tears every time he ate was worth it. they are expensive, but please please please. they are soooo worth it!!!"
2,leaks when warmed,I put warm breastmilk in and for some reason it leaks all the time or leaks when you warm up bottle. to get around this I have to open up the top and let air in before I can feed the baby and sometimes it still leaks...toss and buy different brand playtex
3,Aidan's Mom,"I mostly breastfed my baby until he was 8 months old. We did use bottles once a day as a supplement. I got these bottles because a friend highly recommended them. Here's the pros and cons as I see it:Pros- My son never had issues with spit up or gas while using the bottles.Cons- The bottles leaked easily when shaking up the formula - even with all the inserts in the bottle.- There is writing on the bottle that says ""To prevent leaks do not fill above this line."" The line was even with the capacity of the bottle. I found this odd because once you add formula to a 4 or 8 oz bottle size, the liquid would go over that line. Maybe that's why it leaked, but then how would you feed your child an 8 oz bottle?- Many more parts to clean - not fun to do if you need a bottle in the middle of the night!- They are a little pricey.Bottom line - I would recommend them for using with breast milk or if you have a very gassy baby. If not, use the Avent bottles - much easier to clean and mix formula in."
1,Big Disappointment,"I couldn't wait to try these bottles, my son had very bad colic and trouble with choking and gagging on all types of bottles. I thought these bottles would help since the formula had to go through the ""tube"" and such but after I got these bottles and after spending a fortune for them all they did was leak. I tried all the troubleshooting remedies the website suggests but no results. I contacted handi-craft and they didn't even respond. I would never recommend these bottles to anyone."
2,Dr. Brown Letdown,"I heard so many good things about these bottles, and after no success with the also praised Avent system, I switched to Dr. Brown's. I had no luck with this product, either, and there were more parts to clean with this feeding system. My 2-month-old son spits up even more after feeding (sometimes twice) with the Dr. Brown bottles. I have not noticed any less gas, either, and the nipples flow way too fast for him, even though I purchased the smallest size. I'm glad this product has worked for others, but for me, it was an expensive and failed experiment."
2,It worked for the first week then not really,"At first, these bottles seemed to help my son's spitting up but after about a week of use, he went right back to spitting up volumes."
5,Best Bottles Out There!,"My babies are happiest with these and so am I!Tried Johnson's Evenflo and Playtex Ventaire, but my babies prefer Dr. Brown's!"
5,A Must Have!,"My husband and I saw these bottles reviewed in a parenting magizine and I must say, they are better than we hoped. Our son is only 2 weeks old and I have notice a huge difference in the amount of gas compared to the hospital pre-filled formula we got. They are extremely easy to use, clean and read. I would highly recommend this item to any one using bottles. GREAT INVENTION!"
5,Great Bottles but not good for flying,"I was given both the Avent bottles and the Dr. Browns bottles as a gift for my baby. A friend of mine recommended I use the Dr. Browns bottles because she found them to be so much better. I tried them and fell in love. Now that my daughter is six months, she can handle the bottle herself. I was so pleased with the Dr. Brown,s bottles that I returned the Avent bottles.Important note: Make sure bottles are empty when traveling by plane. If not, milk tends to explode out of the top."
5,these worked for me,My newborn had problems with throwing up and gas when we used the bottles with disposable liners. I had bought one of these bottles to try and we noticed a big improvement. We are not having problems with throwing up and she has much less gas. They do take a little more time to clean but it is worth it to have a happier baby. We will stick with these!
3,"Good for colic, bad for washing","I found that these bottles, although they are good for helping with gas, they are a pain to wash. The little ""plug"" gets black mold inside if you don't wash them correctly and the little brush that they send gets worn out quickly. I'm pregnant with my second and switched to another bottle company that has less time consuming parts to wash and still has been proven to help with colic."
5,Best bottles on the market!!,"I got every kind of bottle that is sold and tried them all out. Basically, I bagged up all the others and bought more of these. They work the best. Everyone that I have talked to says the same thing! Don't spend the money on any other ones, just purchase these. The baby will still get some air in them and need to burp but these seem to work the best!"
5,Great bottles,"I had planned on getting these bottles b/c my sister-in-law used and liked them for preventing gas. The reviews supported her claims so i bought 12. I have twins. The only negative is the cleaning aspect. We live in an old house with no dishwasher so cleaning all the parts is a hassle. My children have had no major incidences with gas pains and did not suffer from colic. Maybe I was lucky or maybe the bottles helped. Either way, i am very satisfied with this purchase."
1,Terrible Bottles,I tried these bottles for my 1 month old daughter because they are supossed to help with gas. We tried both the long neck bottles and the fat bottles and both were terrible. She had worse gas than with the Avent bottles and the nipples are two soft. We have switched back to the Avent bottles that we used with my older daughter and she seems to be much more happy. Don't buy these bottles.
1,These are horrible,At first this bottle was great. Then after about one month the bottles started leaking and the rubber piece that goes on the top part started to get mold on it. I was so dissapointed so I e-mailed doctor brown and they never responded. So I would never buy this bottle again
1,Don't waste your money...,"I purchased Dr. Brown's bottles for my daughter. The idea behind the vent is great but what a pain to put together! With a very fussy newborn, I did not have time to waste assembling the bottle. We discovered that Evenflo and Avent bottles work just as well and are cheaper."
3,Dr. Brown Nursing Bottles,"I bought the Dr. Brown bottles for my grandson, he had a x-ray when he was three weeks old and showed no blockage and had his formula changed three times. I heard of the Dr. Brown bottles and bought them for him and the doctor recommended putting a tablespoon of cereal to each ounce of milk. He still brings some up but not all the time but usually when he does it is quite a bit. Does any one have any more suggestions on this problem. The doctor don't seem concerned but the parents are young and really don't know much about babies and gets scared when this happens. Sometimes he brings some up a half hour to an hour after eating"
5,Best bottles,I love these bottles. I have been using them now for 10 months and I have never had a problem with them. They do take time to clean but it is well worth it to stop my child's gas problem she had with other bottles.
3,They're ok,"I went from Advent to Playtex to Dr. Brown's. Although the seal is good for feeding, My daughter is still gassy. I do not see any air going back into the nipple. Most infants are gassy no matter what bottle you use, their digestive tracks take a full year to develop. I recommend Mylacon drops instead."
3,Not sure it made any difference,"My baby is 6 months old and she keeps spitting up. We, however, still use the Dr Brown bottles... Not sure we would like to risk it with other bottles and make it even worse! I wanted to tell you that the cleaning is not that bad and that it's worth trying. Don't get small bottles, though, unless it is for something different tha formula feeding; 4 oz is nothing!"
4,PAIN TO CLEAN but otherwise GREAT,"I'd say these were the best thing I tried with my collicky baby. Those whining mothers that expect to NEVER have spit-up are not living in the real world, but this definitely was a huge improvement - and she seemed to be more comfortable.HOWEVER, they really don't get clean enough in the dishwasher - I handwash all the pieces with satisfactory results (even tho' its one more detail for me to manage as a full time working mother). I find anything is worth having a happy, healthy baby.My big complaint is that now she's 6 months old and I had a very hard time finding the #3 nipples. Found them at the factory website, though."
5,satisfied customer,The Dr.Brown bottles have really helped my daughter with gas and an upset stomach. She doesn't have as much spit up with Dr.Brown bottles like she did with regular bottles. With these bottles her stomach isn't as upset so she cries less and sleeps longer.
5,are the best,"Dr Brown's bottles are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. for the 1st 2 week I used other brands, but the bottles leaks, my baby had a lot of gas, and my baby was crying almost all the time because of the stomach aches (colico,) once my baby used Dr Brown's everything was perfect, now he only use Dr. Brown because he loves it and I love it! some reviews talk about the small parts being difficult to wash that's not true, it is just and extra work that you have to do but after a while you get used to it (and it's the best for the bb). Just don't be lazy!"
4,Have a New Born? Buy this bottle!,"We were at first dubious about this bottle, especially since our son was very finnicky with it when we first started to use it. However, after a few attempts it worked great. Much easier to burp the baby."
3,Bad markings!,"I had heard great things about Dr Brown's bottles so used them from the start for my baby. She has not had any colic at all and I really don't mind washing these bottles like a lot of people do. But I was very disappointed when I started using the 8oz bottles. After about a month of use, the markings on the bottle started coming off and now I can't even measure the milk properly. I have switched to playtex ventair now and because the nipples on both these bottles are similar my baby has had no problems adapting to the new bottles."
2,Dr. Browns 3 Pack 8oz. Bottles,"I bought these bottles because my newborn had gas after feedings which made her have colic. The five star reviews is what sold me. When I received the bottles, I was so excited to try them. To my disappointment, there was no change with her gas. In fact, I thought she was even more cranky at times. I find the Playtex Ventaire to be more effective than these bottles."
2,Daughter didnt like them.,I bought these because my daughter was a spitter. She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate. So I bought these to try and she hated them. I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too. The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers. You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it. plus she was easier to burb. I wouldnt recommend these or avent.
4,"Great bottles, not so great nipples","I noticed an improvement immediately after using these bottles. My baby sleeps better and is more content day and night. She has much less gas, although she still spits up quite a bit. I am not happy with the nipples - the stage 1 is much too fast for her. The formula flows out without her sucking at all so when she starts to fall asleep her mouth fills up with formula and runs out. It is also confusing for her as she sucks with the pacifier but not with the bottle. I am now using the Playtex Ventaire stage 1 nipple with Dr. Brown's bottles and it seems to work much better."
1,Unsatified - oh yes!,"Hello, I bought the Dr. Brown's bottles because everybody recommended them, for possible colic or gas. . . they're just great! EVERYBODY SAID. But nobody comments on the constant spilling (I actually have to make the formula with a cloth or bib around the neck of the bottle) because when you open the cap I have to be ready of a lot of milk coming out and you can NEVER leave the bottles upside down or sideways = SPILLING FOR SURE!! Also these bottles are hard to clean and maintain, if you don't dry well the inside parts by the second day they get mold!!!! And also the caps don't fit well in every bottle as the Avent bottles. So I only recommend these bottles if your baby has colic problem, otherwise use AVENT PLEASE!!!"
5,Love It!,"I breastfed my son until he was 4 months old and during the transition from breast to bottle is took us nearly 2 months to find a bottle he would eat from - he would just chew the nipples on the others. Once we tried the Dr. Brown's he took to it right away. Now, this is the only bottle my son will eat from! I love that they have so many options of replacement nipples. My son is almost 6 months old now, and he's on a stage 2 nipple, but I think that they go up to a stage 4 or 5, so we have more for him to grow in to!"
1,I HOPE YOU LIKE MOLD!!!!,"These bottles are horrible!! My son had bad gas so we tried these. They did work great for the gas, but one of the bottles in the 3-pack did not assemble correctly and leaked terribly. They also took FOREVER to clean and assemble.. not fun when you have a hungry infant crying for his food!Here's the kicker.. I boiled all the parts every day, and cleaned them thoroughly every time with the enclosed brush, but two weeks later I noticed some MOLD growing on all 3 of the beige peices. I cut open one of them and was disgusted to find a layer of brownish green mold coating the inside! No wonder he'd been having screaming episodes and started spitting up!!I felt like a horrible mother for using these bottles!If you want to prevent GAS, use Playtex nursers with Drop-in liners. They're SO much more sanitary, easy to clean, portable, CHEAPER, and prevent gas better than those bottles ever did for my son.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,just ok,i don't think they are any better then platex drop in's. just they have more parts to clean.
2,not worth all the hype,"Unfortunately, I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown's bottles. I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles. The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out. I never filled them past the line, but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold. They leaked standing upright or laying down. I'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time. It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck. Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain. I really do not reccomend these bottles. I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out. I'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins. They have never leaked and I'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out!!"
1,Extra Work and Inconvenient,"I am sorry I chose to use the Doctor Brown bottles. The inserts are a lot of extra work. You can't heat the bottles up or mix the formula with the inserts in. Without the inserts they leek so I have to premake all of my formula and then pour it into the bottle. Traveling with them is inconvenient because the inserts need to go into the bottle after heating, so I have to pack them separately. They also leak on an airplane, which I found out the hard way. The inserts consist of two pieces, which make for more washing. This takes more of my time which is already stretched. My baby still spits up a lot. The bottles are very expensive. Had I not invested so much money in them already, I would start anew."
2,Not too impressed..,My Daughter didn't have less gass with this bottle at all.I know it isn't her formula because she does better with playtex nursers than Dr. Brown's. I was just looking for a bottle with more space for formula. I hated the extra parts to this bottle..just more to clean and hassle with. I also did not like the fact that you can't shake it b/c it leaks everywhere and when you go to heat it up you have to take the nipple and all off or the formula leaks everywhere. Not very convenient when you are holding your fussy baby at 2:30am.
3,Try Playtex Nurser,"Like most moms I wanted the best for my baby. I thought the best ment expensive so I checked out the Dr.Browns bottles. The reviews sounded great, so I got them. At first I loved them, and would recomend them to anyone. A month down the road I got tired of spending a half hour washing 6 bottles a day(15 min. twice a day.) I went to the store and got the Playtex Nurser with the new nipple. At first I was doubtfull, then I tried it! Now not only do I save time washing bottles, my son is getting less air in his tummy. I spent 10 min. trying to burp him every way when I realized he didn't have to burp! So moms do yourself a favor even if you like Dr.Browns bottles and give the Playtex Nurser a try. They only cost a few bucks so your not out much if you don't like them."
1,Tried it numerous times.....,"Our daughter has no colicky problems nor any other related bottle problems. However, we originally used Avent bottles but wanted to try something sleeker and compact. After reviewing the minimal selection of thinner bottles at Babies r us, we decided on Dr. Brown's based upon the postive reviews read. Unfortunately, I can't give a positive review as the others have. We gave this product a fair try for two and a half months with no success at all. When it is time for feeding, it is too much work to just warm it up. In order to warm the liquid up without spillage, one must remove the nipple and other parts. When we shake the bottle to dissolve the formula clumps, it leaks and squirts all over. I really would like to continue using the bottles if I was able to solve these issues. But because my daughter doesn't have any bottle issues, it isn't quite neccessary to use complicated bottles. These must be only useful for troubled eaters....."
2,Challenge(d) of Flight,"I have the VHS tapes from years ago when this series was first released. This was good as far as this disk. BUT there were MANY other episodes, and ALL of them needs to be put on disc and sold. Many were BETTER episodes."
5,From an A. Co. 1/8 Marine,"I was there with Alpha Co. 1/8 Weapons Plt. Attached to 1st Plt.I pre-ordered this book, hoping for the best. What I got was just amazing. I read it from cover to cover in a day. All the stories, atleast the ones from Alpha Company brought back memories.This book was written well, and is nothing but factual. Some of the names/ranks are wrong but that can be forgiven. It gave the average person insight into what we went through in that city. And brought back alot of memories of the things we did.After I was done reading it I passed it along to my family to take a gander at. They were all pleased with it also.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little knowledge on what really went down in the streets of Fallujah."
4,I can't wait for the 2nd edition,"I bought this book because my brother, the Battalion Chaplain, was there in Fallujah and I wanted to learn more about what happened there. Mr. Livingston did meticulous research and presented an excellent account.However, it was a little difficult reading, because it seemed pieced together at times. But overall a fine account of the fine and honorable actions of those brave men."
5,unspoken words,"I purchased this book our son was also there with the 1/8th and his name is mentioned in the book, Gary THANK YOU for the book our son doesnt talk much about this and it gave us a inside view of what wasnt said without all the politics. You did a great job on the book and would like to THANK ALL the 1/8th and their famlies for what they did. TO ALL our service members STAY SAFE and STAND PROUD for what you doBoo's MOM from MI"
2,Good but Dispassionate,"This is a well written and enjoyable book. However, I had just read a few days before, We Were One: Shoulder to Shoulder With the Marines Who Took Fallujah and what a difference. You could tell that this book was primarily written from reading mission reports and letters. Those segments just didn't have any color to them and were not material to suck you into the book. There were definitely some segments that appear to have come from personal interviews and they were definitely more colorful and interesting.This book is a worthwhile read if you're going to read a few books on Fallujah, but if you had to chose one, pick We Were One. The guy was there and the writing is just much more passionate and engaging."
2,a great story / a disappointing book,"Why can't the author get it right ?The Marines of 1/8 fought with bravery, skill, and courage. Why can't the author take the time and effort to get his facts right, or get the names right ? Surely in his effort to quickly get a book on Fallujah on the market, he can take the extra time to do as good a job in his writing as did the Marines in their fighting. There are some excellent books coming out now about Fallujah; this is not one of them."
3,Not the greatest...,The author seems to have done alot of research into the details and facts but the story didn't seem to flow very well. It was interesting to read about how a modern day infantry battalion moves and operates in an urban battlefield though. Heroic deeds described for sure but the writing style made me sleepy. If you want to read about the Battle of Fallujah you're better off to pick up No True Glory.
5,An informative introduction and illuminating commentaries,"Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the great and enduringly popular writers in the history of English literature. While most readers will be familiar with his major novels, literary commentator and scholar Roger Robinson (Senior Professor of English, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand) has selected and compiled Stevenson's best ""Pacific Writings"" and enhanced them for contemporary readers with an informative introduction and illuminating commentaries. A welcome and enthusiastically recommended compendium, especially for students, scholars, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the life and work of Robert Louis Stevenson!"
3,Nice story but no meat,"Alf claims to be the first rock n' roll bodyguard and it's interesting to read how he fell into the job. A nice guy and a nice read but if you are buying this to read controversial info on celebrities, you will disappointed.Alf describes his early life, history in the service and boxing followed by his foray into the life of a bodyguard. Alf has great history with the Beatles particularly, but also the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cher and Frank Sinatra as well as many others. While he talks about the good traits, there is no dirt or secrets about these people.Probably the most interesting relationship he has is with Mike Nesmith of the Monkees. Mike comes across as an interesting guy stuck in a bubble gum band that wants to evolve on a higher level musically.While this is an enjoyable read, there is no real meat to the book that would need to be there to sell in large numbers."
3,for the money awesome,"These beauties sound good. They really do. The bass is good, and the highs are high. It has a handy volume knob on the right speaker, along with on/off button and LED. There is no better sounding speaker for the money. With that said, there are some quirks to these babies. 1) they are not shielded, and you must find some signal 'sweet spot' to get that annoying low buzzing to subside 2) too many cords! it's cord crazy with power, plug in, and cord going everywhich way.Buy these for solid, good sounding PC speakers that won't even break the budget. $20 bucks come on!!"
2,Definitely a compromise,"At 14 watts I didn't expect much power, which is fine. At $15 I didn't expect great quality, I didn't realize how important that aspect would be to me. I cannot bear to listen to these speakers, their response is so lifeless, the middles are dull and there is no crispness to the highs. Vibrant bass notes are betrayed by the tiny, tinny, woofer.Do you miss the mushy sound of a live concert while wearing sponge earplugs? Then these speakers are for YOU!I should have known better..."
1,Poor Service,"Bought this item with the store pickup option. Was to be ready for pickup in 1 to 4 hours, in stock (store is 10 minutes from my house), now I receive an email stating it will be 1 to 3 weeks for delivery. Forgot why I stopped shopping at Amazon.con, I won't forget again."
5,I got the same feeling watching this movie that I got with Rocky!,"I had heard some good things about this movie, and now I can consent with the majority. This was just a really fun movie! Is it realistic? No, not really, but that doesn't mean it's not capable of giving you joy from watching it. Just like in Rocky, you have an underdog that comes from humble beginnings to rise to a place of prominence, success, and fame. I really didn't expect to get so excited cheering for the heroes of this movie, but more than once I found myself throwing a couple of fist pumps! When a movie gets you to do that, it has clearly succeeded in engaging its audience! Lots of fun, and relatively clean for a PG-13 movie. You've got a couple swear words thrown in here and there, but no blood, no sex, and most of the violence consists of CGI-animated robots beating the snot out of one another. I'd definitely recommend this movie!"
4,Very good movie,"Think Rocky. Not as stellar, but VERY well executed, acted and done. I expected a bad script kids flick. However, I have to hand it to the script writer and Hugh Jackman to take Rockem Sockem Robots and a father son kid stereo type arc that has been done a thousand times, and yet deliver a feel good Rocky film. Real kudos to the kid who plays Jackman's son. He stands up well against Jackman, which is hard to do when Jackman is a fantastic talent. Guys like Stallone, Clooney, Jackman 'steal' every scene they are in - that is why they are stars. In the scenes with Jackman, the kid was very talented considering who he was acting alongside. That was no mean feat. I'd definitely recommend this as a good movie for anyone, despite the marketing as a kid flick. There is enough Rocky in it to make it an adult flick that most will like."
5,Real Steel,"Great movie, one to watch again and again. A movie the family can watch. I loved then relationship that developed between father and son"
5,Just what I wanted,"Now this is what I call incredible, Lively full of suspense wonderful ideas for the storyline with great talent from Hugh Jackman and the performers, I can say that it was terrific and what more than to have robots bash the living daylights out of each other,I wont say too much the entertainment is full on with mind filling enjoyment plenty of action thrills and spills just a little touch of comedy. I rated this show an A plus, a must for your private dvd collection. Relax enjoy worth viewing with the drinks and calories. Judge for yourself its for everyone in the family, a pleasure to watch."
4,Better than I expected,"I didn't care much for what I saw in the trailers for this film, and let's be honest that it's kind of a weak title. That being said, I really enjoyed the movie. The special effects were impressive without being overdone and in your face, and the story line worked very well. I found myself caring about the characters a lot more than I initially thought I would. Jackman was excellent as always, and Evangeline Lilly...well, she was nice to look at anyway."
3,A popular premise done once again,"This movie was like pouring ""Rocky"" and ""Over the Top"" into a blender and pressing liquify on the panel.... a popular premise that has worked very well in the past, and don't get me wrong, I liked it, but the acting was very emotionless and wooden which killed any emotional investment in it for me. I found it odd that Max never even tried to call Charlie ""Dad"" and Charlie never really tried to connect with his son. That made his ""one last chance"" at the end ring false to me and then to have all the characters at ringside at the end was just too cheesy.All in all, I could see most kids really liking this flick and it does have some mediocre entertainment value so I will call this movie ""OK""..."
3,Real Steel Review,"If you combine two of Sylvester Stallone's movies, ""Over the Top"" and ""Rocky 1"", and make robots the subject matter, you'll get ""Real Steel"". During the last fight scene I was tempted to shout out, ""Rocky! Rocky!"""
5,Good family movie,"This movie surprised me, and in a good way. Action, heart, and more family values than I expected. Not high art, but an enjoyable movie nevertheless."
3,"Its really a kids movie, but still enjoyable","The robot fights and their associated sound tracks is pretty good, especially if you have home theater system. But as other reviewers mentionned, its really a moviemade for kids as the young lad in this movie is pretty smart...talks a lot and likesto give orders, that 's pretty good for a 11 year old kid.... So once you have thatout of the way, you have the story.If i was a under 16, i would love this movie...but for a adult, the movie is notbad, but could have been better.I liked it,but its not a keeper,thats enough teary google eyes for one session."
4,THE BEST UNDERDOG ROBOT MOVIE EVER!,"This is the best of the recent robot movies. Far, far better than the TRANSORMER films. And it's hands down the best underdog robot movie ever.Hugh Jackman is Charlie Kenton, a boxer past his prime who lost a shot at the title when the fad for bigger, badder, robot fighters took over the ring. Now, reduced to a backwater promoter pasting busted bot parts into fighting machines for low-end fights, he must reluctantly deal up with his estranged son (Dakota Goyo) and try building a champion robot.Wonderful effects and beautiful cinematography underscore the intense action of this sometimes poignant but satisfying story of redemption in and out of the ring. Not smarmy or overly sentimental. It worked for me and my family."
4,A lot better than expected,"My first impression of Real Steel wasn't that good. It looked kinda fun, but kinda not that great. After watching it however, I have to say I enjoyed it tremendously. It actually has a story. It isn't just a bunch of cool action scenes mixed in with a threadbare plot and cardboard characters. This is a boxing movie with robots though and when the action comes, it works great and yes its big and loud, but not unnecessary.Real Steel is almost nothing like the Matheson short story. The characters, the plot, the time period are all changed, but thats not a bad thing. They're just separate stories. To be honest I liked the movie better, but I recomend the short story as well.Real Steel is a popcorn movie through and through and its got a lot of heart to go with it."
2,Massive second hand embarrassment while watching this,"Hugh Jackman was paid $9million to act in this movie: maybe he should take that money and hire a better manager that can get him decent scripts. This was just sad to watch - Jackman, usually a pleasure to watch, decided that his character should be shouting out his every line. Probably to distract the audience from just how bad this movie is. Zero character development, thinnest plotline ever, stereotypes vs. actual characters, and a truly, horrendously painful russian accent.The robot, Atom, is very cool though. I would have been happy to watch more of it. They should have just cut out the ""estranged father/son bonding"" stuff, and just put in more robots. At least THEY could act; which is more than you can say about the actual human actors in this movie.Please don't spend your $4 on renting this: just wait till it comes out on tv."
3,"Nice looking, but...","Had all the elements of a great movie,but it still came across as mostly surface acting to me.Maybe on a different day with less expectation it might seem better.Did not buy this movie, watched it on my Blu-Ray player over Amazon Instant Video.Should have given this review under the HD version."
3,Decent Movie With Your Son,"Your 10 year old will probably like this a lot, and you will be reasonably annoyed by the cliche's, and unimaginative story, but at least you'll enjoy some decent robot FX."
4,Kids movie,"While watching it, I recognized the story from an episode from the twilight zone. This was a remake for kids unfortunately I am not into such movies.It is a father and son story more then a science fiction story.The acting overall was a bit wooden. I thought that Evangeline Lilly could have done much better, she is a good actress as could just about everyone else except Hugh Jackman, who acted well.The filming was very good, the special effects are very good and for this reason I gave it four stars.Would I recommend it, only to people that are into father and son type movies, would I see it again NO!"
4,Not bad,"Didn't know if I was going to like it, but it was an enjoyable movie. Wish Atom would have knocked off Zeus's head."
2,Way worse than I expected - bad writing,"I have not seen such a forced, predictable, and poorly directed film in a long time. Total Hollywood schlopp. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one was the animatronics."
2,Poor HD quality video,"Could not appreciate the whole movie due to HD quality resolution, I pay for HD and got less than regular DVD quality, very, very poor quality."
3,Intriguing... but wrong,"You can have a movie whose nature echoes its own motif. A black-and-white movie about years gone by; a movie in three parts about three-ness; a movie told in reverse about retrospection. Even an awesome movie about awesomeness.What you *can't* do is have a movie that is abysmal-for-the-first-half-then-makes-a-great-comeback about being abysmal but then making a great comeback. It doesn't work. People will lose interest during the first half and quite possibly quit watching. It's a really stupid thing to do, intentional or not. I would bet unintentional in this case.If you want to know how bad the first half is, read the 1-star reviews. If you want to know how good the second half is, read the 3 and 4 star reviews. No-one with any discernment wrote a 5-star review for this movie. And anyone criticizing it for being derivative ought to know that while fine taste is an asset to enjoying art, a fine memory is not."
5,Brilliant film!,Great disney feel good film and Hugh Jackman is great. Defo one to watch! I've kept my review short as people have seemed to write essays's about it!
4,Rockin Sockin Robots :),"I took my son, that is 12, to see the movie while my wife and daughters saw Paranormal Activity 3. We both had a blast watching the story unfold about the bonding of a father and son with their boxing robot Atom. The boxing robots looked really cool and the fighting scenes were a enjoy to watch. We will buy this movie for sure to add to our DVD library."
4,Inspirational and gripping.,"A former boxer takes the young son he abandoned long ago as he becomes involved in the shadowy world of underground robot boxing. They find an old sparring robot and they are able to get an opportunity to put him in a professional match. The film climaxes with a fight against the mightiest boxing robot in the world. During this adventure, the boxer develops a relationship with the boy that he never knew. This is a delightful film about an underdog trying to achieve the unexpected, and also about a man becoming a father to his growing son. The way the film was scored really adds to the inspirational theme and the characters are more than just backdrops for the fighting. It contains elements that appeal to all demographics. This is a terrific movie that the whole family will enjoy."
1,movie,When we received it and put it in the player it would not play the movie was in Italian so we could not even watch it.
4,Rocky Meets Transformers,"Ex-Boxer traveling through town to town using robots to compete in boxing matches, down on his luck & short on cash, he discovers he has a son and doesn't know if can handle the responsibility of being a father. he brings him along and they find a robot that was the underdog in its day can handle taking the hits in the ring and come out winning. Between all of this its a story about a father & son becomeing closer. Well written, good special effects and has a Rocky message."
4,"""Real Steel""","Sylvester Stallone's movie ""Over the Top"" meets ""Rocky."" Throw in robots and you got ""Real Steel"" I still enjoyed the movie even though it was very predictable. Kids will love it."
1,Not a single likeable character,"Wish I hadn't trusted these reviews when picking a movie to watch. Only 3 1-star reviews. Wow. Seriously people? The movie was predictable, and the fighting was nothing cool, just boxing. Transformers had better robot fighting. But mainly, the kid is absolutely annoying and you hope the robot punches him in the face at some point. And Jackman's character is equally unlikeable. A POS father figure who has a half-assed turn around. Wish I had spent my 2 hours and $4 on something better, like anything other than REAL STEEL."
1,not worth watching,This movie could have been even better if it was written intirly differint. It not just the main charter who is dumb as a door nail but the little brat kid who should be a poster child for birth control. I wanted turn off the movie two times but I figured I pay to rent it so I saw the whole movie with the discusing little brat. The guy in it seemed cool as the movie went on but the kid is another story.
1,predictable,"so predictable it is not even worth watching, it starts out his robot kicks butt then gets creamed and the same with the 2nd robot, then he gets his kid for the summer and the kids robot takes a beating but always ends up winning until the final event is the judges decision. Of course as predictable as ever the kids robot won but the decision is for the bad robot, lol"
1,Animal cruelty. Don't watch.,I aint like no hick story about hurtin a bull. My hick radar aint likin dat sit. Seriously. Animal cruelty. Don't watch.
2,"Nothing special, just the usual shortlife popcorn cinema","I just went to the cinema and wanted to watch a movie, and this one was the only new available one.There are some senseless moments in the movie, example the kid slides down into the gap at the scrap yard where he finds Atom the Robot and manages to dig him out and carry him up on the surface on his own ....yeah sure...and then these stupid dancing scenes the kid makes with the robot....worst to come after the finale the declare Atom the peole's real hero.Sometimes when watching such movies I get the feeling, they start making the movies without a real script...they just do time to time a brainstorming which ends more in a braindead."
3,JUST OK,"This movie was just ok.Every other word in this movie was I CAN,T , I CAN,T.... almost turned it off. I gave it three stars because the robots were cool. The cast over acted a bit."
5,Rocky!,"If you have seen Any of the Rocky 1-5 movies you have already seen this movie, or at least the plot. Regardless, I love Rocky and another version is always welcome."
3,no so bad!,"This movie got terrible reviews, but as a parent I've sat thru way worse! I enjoyed this movie with my boys who REALLY enjoyed it. Plus Hugh Jackman isn't hard on the eyes."
5,Unexpected,"When we purchased this movie we were amazed at how endearing this little vignette was, at surface it looked to be a sci-fi beat em up with robots, a great way to spend an evening, but the warming little story of father and child left us with tears and joy, not that it was a happy ending.Hugh Jackman is an actor with hidden depths and played his part par excellence'. An excellent, and surprisingly good, movie I have no problem recommending to friends!"
4,great movie nice story.,"Nice family movie good Rocky type theme , it moved along at a good pace some nice action cool premise."
4,"An ""Action"" film which is surprisingly heartwarming!","[THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE]I never caught this film at the theatre because I thought that it would be just some mindless ""smash and bash"" (i.e. HULK SMASH) type of action film.Well, I was glad to be proven wrong! :)My family and I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning all the way to the end.YES, it is an ""action"" film with plenty of Robot smashing and bashing.However, the screen writers have managed to weave a very plausible tale of lost love (and family), betrayal and final redemption into this movie.The plot and movie lines were really engaging and filled with irony.For example, there was this scene whereby the protagonist's 11 year old son ticks off his old man for acting like a child! :)This movie deserves 4.5 stars for the superb original storyline, fine acting and heartfelt dialogue. At the end of the film, this movie will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside ala ""As Good As It Gets"".This film is therefore highly recommended."
5,Rocky with Transformers,"Classic feel good movie, you really become attached to the story's characters and find yourself cheering for the robot underdog. It ends so well that you almost wish for a sequel until you realize a sequel would only take away from how the movie ended."
4,Better than expected,"I was not expecting much when I first watched this movie but was pleasantly surprised. The kid is a bit annoying at times, but Hugh and the robots make up for it"
4,Very Good Movie,I like Huge Jackman as an actor and the movie was very good but not one that I would watch over and over. I would rather have just rented it.
2,Different?,"""Rocky"" with robots. This film wasn't very well thought out. You could almost put Stallone in this movie as ""Rocky"". It totally lacks in imagination. If it weren't for Jackman and Dakota Goyo I wouldn't even have finished it. The two of them work well together, just not this film."
4,REAL STEEL,GREAT MOVIEI pretty much love anything with Hugh Jackman (EYE CANDY) but this one especially touched me. Wonderful and entertaining!
4,Surprised me - in a good way.,This movie was better than expected. It's not just a geek robot movie. If you don't like the beginning - be patient. The writers are just doing a good job making you feel the way you're supposed to about the main character. It gets better... a lot better!
4,Good movie,"Its a good movie to watch, very entertaining. If your into sci fi this is a good one for you because its not so futuristic but it does have robots."
3,well...so so,"I have seen better and I have seen worse, it is a old theme really just copied and updated a bit to fit the times. It did not captivate my attention at all and at times just seemed like it was being ""filled in"" to stretch the film out. It is probably a great movie to some, it is just not my cup-o-tea so to speak."
5,Awesome moive,"I totally thought this looked cheesy, but I'm so glad I watched it, it was a great pick. Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed it"
3,Real cheese,"3.3 starsI normally love Jackman, but this is his worst movie, due mainly to truly weak direction by Shawn Levy. That and a hackneyed Disneyesque script make this potentially fine idea limp and boring. I know a lot of folks love this flick, and more power to them, but while watching it with a fellow lover of action films we kept grimacing at how predictable it all was.The robots are fun, no doubt, but Real Steel feels for the most part like an ABC Afterschool Special. So many cheesy and hamhanded moments and so few truly funny lines. Jackman does his best but clearly Levy isn't very good at drawing our truly fine performances, and the seen-it-all-before script does no one any favors.We were really psyched to see this after all the hype, but in the end were mostly bored by a film that looks pretty good but never really got us excited."
4,Solid action movie.,"Real Steel has something for everyone. My wife doesn't typically like action movies but she loved this movie. It has great special effects, a solid cast, excellent script, and is appropriate for children IMO."
3,Real Steel,"The film that many dubbed Rock'em Sock'em Robots: The Movie initially surprised quite a few folks by being much better than a movie with that premise had any right to be. Set in 2020, when giant robots have overtaken the boxing circuit, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlien Kenton, a former boxer-turned-robot trainer who is saddled with caring for his estranged young son Max when Max's mother dies. When the pair discover an obsolete sparring bot called Atom in a junkyard, they decide to rebuild him together, and an unlikely bond develops. I concede that the premise is silly, the dialogue a little cheesy, the plot -- like its mechanical protagonist -- a bit recycled, but if you're looking for a relatively straightforward underdog story with a smattering of father-son bonding, you could certainly do worse."
5,Rock 'em Sock 'em,Ever play with Rock'em Sock'em robots as a kid? Looks like Hugh Jackman got the life size version! Excellent movie.
1,Defective DVD...:-(,"I received my DVD on time, but at the end the DVD freezes and it's at the most crucial part of the movie! I checked for scratches and smudges, but there were none, so I am assuming that the DVD is defective. I have contacted the seller, but am waiting for a response to see if they can resolve the issue."
1,Paid for HD,"I was just getting into this movie when it paused and reloaded in SD with only one dot. It was very fuzzy. I went to another channel and watched something else for a while. But the HD was still out an hour later. I'm going to try again tonight.I don't think it was my connection. I got HD quality on Netflix streaming. I have a nine foot (110"") screen. HD works for me.Amazon HD streaming is charged at the highest rates. I typically rent one or two movies from Amazon each month. I'm rethinking that."
1,Not what they say,"I perchest this movie thinking it was a 2 disk movie. It came in a cheese case with one disk . When I received disk it had a big scratch and cant watch it , not happy with this"
2,BLURRYNGRETNA,"When I first saw the movie I loved it. So that is why I ordered it and I can't stand watching a bad copy of a movie. It was kind of blurry and I did not enjoy watching. Will never order a used movie again.""You get what you pay for""!!!!"
4,An indirect Rocky.,Jackman has never been better in this role of a deadbeat dad and former boxer who now mooches a living off of fighting robots that have replaced human boxers. The kid in this film is also very good and the love interest is a beautiful woman whose father managed Jackman years ago.The movie was sent very quickly and was in very good condition. Thanks.
3,Rocky with Robots,"It is really just that simple. An entertaining enough movie. No surprises, good action, same basic story line of an absentee father. It is Rocky with robots and a back story of how a kid grows on his own father. It's worth a watch, but rent it, don't own it."
5,Best Movie,"I had to watch this over again, it is so entertaining. Hugh Jack is a superb actor in this exciting movie."
5,Excellent Movie,Wonderful movie to watch as a family. Action is terrific and its a feel-good movie people of all ages can enjoy!
4,Great for Family Night,I thought this movie was great for family night at my home. My kids really got into the movie and I thought the movie was fun. I waited for a while to get this movie at the great price I brought it for. It was worth it to me and my family.
2,Culturally biased; rhythmically flawed,"While this version may prove useful for comparative study, the so-called ""translation"" represents a diminished version of the text, both in rhythm and texture, despite claims to the contrary.Furthermore, a number of word substitutions reflect unacknowledged biases. How could they not? This is an interpretation, not a translation. The original is written in perfectly good English, however much some of it may be considered archaic. But the appreciating the aesthetic qualities of older works of art is a distinct part of the pleasure and educational value of reading them."
5,As described and more,Bought these based on Amazon reviews and I am extremely happy with them. Quality appears to be very high. I feel like for the size this is an extremely good value.
4,Son Like it,"I bought these for my son and he like them, they played very well (GREAT SOUND BASE AND ALL) for the price , the only thing that did not fit was the black covers and my son wanted them on in place of the ones he have, also the mount for the front speakers I had to frabricate Honda different shape of the mounts. I have a Honda Accord and the shape of the cove were different. I think that if the were to add a universial mount kit they would get the five stars."
5,Great speakers...Great price,I installed these speakers on the back seat shelf of a restored 57 chevy. They fit perfectly! They sound like a Doo Wop group is riding in the back seat singing to me........does not get better than that!
3,Good but not,"So I just wanted to inform everyone that these do not fit like they should. I have a ""97 Dodge Ram 1500 SS/T. The information block for vehicles told me that these speakers would fit. However they did not work without heavy modification as they are far to thick to fit in the door correctly. If you don't want to cut the vinyl on your door or ruin your speakers covers then DO NOT purchase them. I waited for quite a while and had purchased a lot of equipment. I was already hours into the install before realizing the fault. I will post pictures of the damage soon. I own my truck, and already had plans to customize lots of areas however, this was not part of my plan. I gave a rating of three stars because they sound good, but I believe that Amazon should check into this."
4,Solid review of main issues.,"This is a solid review of the main issues and challenges to effectively teaching Spanish. It has provided me with a good launching pad to deeper investigation of some key concerns such as how to best teach adults, what are some limitations and best uses of online instruction and what are some considerations to take into account when trying to infuse training and education with culture when there is so much richness and variation in the Spanish-speaking world. I particularly liked the consideration of teaching ""heritage learners,"" those folks for whom Spanish is the first language and are learning literacy skills while living in the U.S.. This is a thought provoking collection of research reviews."
5,This CD ROCKS,"This CD simply Rocks. With a mixture of raunchy guitar riffs and a touch of reggae, this band just blows your mind. This is the type of music that you don't get sick of listening, it just gets better and better. Their previous CD Hemi Vision is a must for any music fan. These guys have a style of their own. Both CDs are a must."
5,A fun way to learn to read,"With this book my mother taught me to read. The language patterns - cat, hat, fish, dish - naturally guide the interested young reader in the process of learning how letters form words. This book also helps a child learn the other equally important aspects of reading; connecting with stories and ideas. Unlike some Dr. Seuss books that are no more than appealing nonsense, this book presents a cohesive story that provokes thought and discussion along with its appealing nonsense. If you are choosing between Dr.Suess books, I recommend this one."
4,Overpriced,"Amazon's price right now (6/2/07) is 200% higher than T-Mobile's. That's not double the price, but the price plus double the price... so you pay four hundred dollars more than if you bought it from T-Mobile.Lately, I'm finding it cheaper to buy the high-end phones from the carriers because Amazon's prices are consistently outrageous."
1,It's a Shame,"Well i can't recomend this album, it's poor. This guy desn't have any creativity or talent, He is just a Thief that stole music from Musicians, Don't buy it."
5,A story that stays with you,"Remember Wake tells the story of a man who works on a construction crew on Wake island shortly before WWII. When the Japanese attack the island he is taken prisoner. The book tells the story of how he survives horrific conditions in a POW camp, while his fiance' is at home in Boise, Idaho. Not only was this a wonderful story, I learned so much about WWII and what the POWs had to endure. I highly recommend it."
1,Falls short of expectations,"While the author should be commended for her research and her effort, the prose is painful, the dialogue sounds fake, and the narrative is cluttered with useless minutiae. While the historical events are certainly of interest, I would not recommend this book."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book. The story hits very close to home. To her credit, the author does a great job of presenting the conditions and stories of the POW's from Wake and their long and painful journey. But - she fell short developing compelling fictional characters. She has a good foundation for the story, but the characters were very simple. Seems like a fair attempt at a first novel. She studied her material well - I'd prefer to have read about the actual experiences of the men and their families instead of the anemic composite characters presented."
5,Wonderful Historical Fiction,"I thoroughly enjoyed Teresa R. Funke's Remember Wake. It was a part of WWII (or any war for the matter) that I have not read/researched much about. The story revolves around Colin and Maggie, a young couple engaged to be married. Just before the war, Colin decides to take a short term job on Wake Island in the pacific to save money for their new life together. Based on a true story, Colin's story takes us to Wake Island during Pearl Harbor and the taking of the island by Japanese forces. We see life through his eyes as a Japanese POW. Maggie's story takes us through life back home, not knowing what has become of her beloved. Great insight into little known parts of the war and a great romance to boot."
5,Useful,"I love this cookbook. I've never made anything from it that I thought was terrible. I've learned how to make pies, crust and all, from scratch! This was a very useful wedding present."
1,These Speakers Are JUNK !!!,"The name ""Pyle"" used to mean something back in the 80's but now it seems to mean just what it sounds like.......First off, these speakers are larger than standard 6 x 9 openings (but they DON'T tell you this anywhere) so I had to cut out my rear deck about a 1/4 inch. After doing that, just to get them mounted, I found out one of the speakers was defective! It sounded just like a blown speaker (buzzing & weird distorted noises) and the other speaker didn't impress me at all! Stock speakers sounded better than these ""Pile"" speakers! I was really expecting a good sound from these speakers as they have HUGE magnets on them & they appeared to look like quality speakers. VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!"
1,Don't waste the time nor money,"Got them in the mail and couldn't wait to put them in. once i got them and put them in they were ok for the time being. after about 2-3 weeks they started buzzing at low volumes and just wastn't what i expected. i then went out and bought some Kicker KS69.3 on e-bay for $80 and LOVE them, they sound soo much better and definatley worth the price. In all, you get what you pay for so don't spend the whopping $33. buy a brand you can trust."
3,OK for the money,"Didn't expect much for the price. Sounded great for a couple of months. Now they are fuzzy when turned down, but goes away when turned up."
1,Not as good as expected,"I installed them in my Honda accord 2006, in substitution of the OEM rear speakers, and they performed barely the same as the OEM. I suggest if you really want to improove the sound quality and a reasonable bass punch , please expend some extra bucks."
4,Great Age Appropriate Story of Hendrix,"With the popularity of Guitar Hero, my 9 yr. old has become interested in guitar legends like Hendrix. The book is perfect for kids in that age group. It's not very long, but it is very thorough. The author does talk about his substance problems, so parents should be aware."
4,Good Radio,"This is a decent radio made by GE. After reading the other reviews from other manufacturers, I was worried about buying a cheaper model that would fall apart. This model does have a real LCD screen and digital tuner. This model is well made, the buttons, screen and remote feel solid. It was worth spending a little extra money to get something better quality."
3,Its OK,"I use this is my kitchen. It looks nice. And works OK. Unfortunately the reception isn't great when the cord isn't completely exposed. My hope was to hide as much of the cord as possible behind a fridge. So make sure that you don't care about the cord showing if you want good reception. There was also a problem with the display screen, the radio station numbers are cut off. Didn't seem significant enough to return especially considering I had already screwed it into cabinet."
4,Spacemaker Review,All's well with this unit. Good reception and adds a nice touch the the kitchen. The remote gives you control from across the room. Still however trying to get the weather station to report the correct in-coming weather being sunny or rainy but did not but it for that bonus.
1,I would never buy another GE radio,Radio dosen't work. I've tried it at every window in our house. Everything else works except we can not get AM or FM stations.
4,like what i got,So far so good. I enjoy the product and it looks good. (Eight more words required Eight more words required)
3,Blind Fury is a good movie But Omega Doom left me bored.,"Blind Fury is a very good if simple movie. I just could not get into Omega Doom. It had some promise, But never followed through on it.At this price Omega Doom is a throw in anyway, so if you likeBlind Fury go ahead and buy this."
4,Blind Fury,"I will always watch most of Rutger Hauer's movies -- I admire his acting ability and presence, according his roles. He is capable of much more than the story lines he is given -- Blind Fury is my second pick to Ladyhawke and am looking forward to seeing Split Second [kind of far out]. Love his sword work - his acting ability -- Blind Fury is well worth seeing for the action, most of the story and entertainment value."
4,Blind Fury and Omega Dung,"Blind Fury is still one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid. Rutger Hauer is a great actor, but I hate to see him in (...) like Omega Doom. I was also disappointed that I had to buy Omega with Blind Fury, hence the one star deduction. But I am still glad I know own one of my favorite light hearted action/comedies of all time, Blind Fury. I think anyone who likes humor mixed with good fighting should give it a try."
2,The music and compilation were not as good as the review . . .,"from a major men's magazine.I love the quirky, offbeat blues/Zydeco/Southern rock/swamp music which is prevalent along the Gulf coast, but this was a disappointment, considering the glowing review which my husband and I had read prior to buying it.But, as with all our music, we'll shelve it for about a year and then revisit when we've been drinking heavily with friends -- and see if that makes it more palatable.Perhaps we'll re-review then."
1,so let down,I loved their first record. Incredible! Very refreshing and original so of course I expected this record to be great. I listened to it once.... and haven't since picked it up. I was that turned off! This is an extremly rare reaction for me. The record simply let me down. Nothing to hook me or even let me grasp on to.
1,"I tried to like this flavoring, actually I bought several LOL",I have to say I tried to like this flavoring. I have gotten 7 different flavors. I tried them in baking mostly. I found that you needed a lot to even make it taste like anything (I found an unpleasant aftertaste).I honestly can not recommend this brand of flavoring. Amazon customerservice is great but this company Capella has not responded to my emails. Their customer service is terrible if you have problems. Maybe someone else would think these are great but I am not one of them.Thank you and God bless you.
1,Through the Fire,I never received the book - got an email yesterday (22 June) that they have refunded my money $4.95 to my credit card.
5,a definate buy for spoof fans,"OK, first you have to have to watch Tom Gun then Robin Hood with Kevin Costner. Because this movie combo picks on these two movies. In order to get some of the jokes, you need to see them. There are other, political satires or making fun of some of the famous commercials in the DVD as well. With all that said, this is a movie that you will be laughing from beginning to end, yes end. Please do read the end credits. Jokes are in there too. This is a must spoof/satire movie for your DVD library."
4,Great song,Good News:I like the song and everything on the albumBut the bad news is Strictly rhythm is not letting Kreo create the full album. Sorry for the report.
4,A true love story,"The authors provde insight into how much love can spring forth from the simple act of sharing life with a pet. So much love, in fact, that one Golden Retriever was not enough."
3,Typical Gang Style Movie,This is sort of the type of movie people expect about gang war. Andy Lau star as a semi-retired gang leader who's good friend Anthony Wong (also a clan of the gang) was injuried during a brawl. Anthony's Son star by Patrick Tam wasn't satisfy with Andy being the gang leader and taking all the credits for his father's work. He decided to take revenge on Andy Lau. Andy Lau's left hand assistance starred by Louis Koo plays as an under cover cop trying to nail Andy Lau's crime. The story basically talks about Patrick's revenge and how Andy try to rescue his family and not get caught by Louis at the same time
5,Different,"I found my copy in the free box at the library. I only picked it up because I found all three books. It is now one of my favorites. I found that is is very different from book one. It is similar to the second book, which is a bit like a transition between book one and book three. It is very original fantasy. The ending was a bit unsatisfactory. You never learn what happened to everyone other than who's King of Lyonya and that Paks defeats Liart, at least temporarily. What happens to the Duke's sense of taige? A follow-up would be welcomed. All together though, it was a very good book. :)"
5,Great book,"Highly suggest reading this book, the best in the series by far (and that is saying a lot) this book is very good, and leaves the reader feeling all warm and fuzzy when done."
4,Paksenarrion Achieves Her Quest,"The final book in The Sheepfarmer's Daughter: The Deed of Paksenarrion trilogy is not my favorite book of the three, but an excellent fantasy novel nevertheless. Author Elizabeth Moon's writing is faultless. Dialouge and descriptions both flow so naturally that the book comes alive. The books starts out great. Paks is despondent, almost suicidal. She turns to the Kuakkgan, a mysterious Druid-like figure for help. The Kuakkgan is one of the most intriguing and original characters in this fantasy series or any other.My main beef with Oath of Gold is that as the book progresses, Paks becomes less human and more of a legendary hero in a painting. Her relationships with the Duke, other soldiers and commanders become more stiff. One things I am upset with is that the trilogy has NO sex or romance. There is not even a kiss. So many promising mates for Paks just end up admiring her and calling her ""Lady."" The most passionate relationship she has is with her horse."
1,The book displayed is not the one I received,I received a different Richard Simmons cookbook that did not have the recipes that I wanted. I was very disappointed.
1,Disappointed,"A grand total of 23 pages.The price guide part of the book was 6 pages. Some nice pictures of linen postcards but overall, a bad value. I expected much more."
2,Bummed.,"I had to come back and change my review. After only 3 hours of wearing this ring, I noticed tarnishing on the inside. So due to that discovery, I searched for a 925 stamp to find that THERE ISNT ONE. I decided to keep wearing the ring and see if it got any worse and an hour later I noticed my finger was starting to green! Such a shame because it is a beautiful ring but I cannot recommend this ring. Its is NOT sterling silver. I will continue to wear this ring for the time being, but if it gets any worse I will be making a return. I'm very disappointed because I love the ring, but its COSTUME JEWELRY.UPDATE:I was in contact with the seller and was told that my finger is greening due to the paint that colors the ring which is green and that i should wash the ring with soap and water. Also that the ring is in fact sterling silver.But still no explanation as to the missing 925 stamp.."
1,If you like throwing away money . . .,Then you'll love these speakers that have about as much audio resonance as a Kazoo.Spend fifty bucks more and get something decent.
2,Background hiss with headphones,"When using headphones, these speakers are plagued by annoying white noise (hissing) in the background. The hissing sound is not a function of volume (turn the volume completely off and the noise is still there), but goes away only when the speakers are shut off. My officemate's Harmon Kardon speaker system does not have this problem.Just now, I bought the Creative Labs SBS270, and I'm sending the Accent system back."
1,do you hear that buzzing?,What? I am sorry I can't hear you over the buzzing and crakeling of my speakers. This is the perfect example of you get what you pay for. What a waste of money. I had them for 6 months then couldn't take it anymore and bought nicer ones.
1,"Snap, Crackle, Pop!",I pretty much hate these and I hate that I'm stuck with them. The sound quality is bad and they hiss even when music isn't playing. I wish I would have forked over the extra $20 and gotten something nicer.
1,channelling the lord!,"all of a sudden, these speakers started to pick up a gospel station. almost as loud as the media i was playing through the speakers...annoying.useless"
5,"Excellent photographs, details, text, and drawings","I have been to Katsura several times, and have several books on Katsura villa, and this new book is the best.This is how architectural books should be produced and photographed so other architects and people interested in architecture can actually learn and use the book not only as a beautiful catalog but as a tool.The beautiful photographs are architecturally photograhed in 1 point perspective except for details, gardens, and exterior. This is helpful as you can deduct the proportion and scale of the rooms. Most of the drawings have measurements, and are very well drawn.The introduction and text by Isozaki is excellent for understanding Katsura and Japanese architectural idealogy. Additionally, there are several past texts by Tange, Taut, Gropius, and etc. to get different perspectives.Katsura, along with several temples and villas have been meticulously maintained for the last 400 years."
2,Don't buy this,You may have a much better version on Symposium 1239. This CD has less songs and is more or less the same. The sound is worse.Martin
4,The Bedroom Tapes is a must have for any folk lover.,"For those who are already fans of Cory Sipper and don't have this album, GO OUT AND GET IT. This is a personal favorite for me, and is stronger (in my mind) than both Orbiter and Swimology, though those are both wonderful albums as well. Other than one or two songs on the album, this is one of those that you can put in the CD player and just listen to all the way through. For anyone who likes acoustic, female singer/songwriters, Cory is a must have for your collection. If you like Joni Mitchell, you'll love this."
3,Starfire - self-titled (Radioactive),"Originally released in 1974, as I believe this to be the obscure psych / progressive band's sole lp - however I saw other CD reissues available on the Internet, but I'm almost sure they're not from the same band - most likely from another group with the same name. Didn't get as much out of this title as I had expected. Tunes I thought were so-so include ""Comfort Me"", ""My Love Is Gone"", the seven-minute (sort of) jamming ""Birth Of The Sun"" and maybe ""Merry Crises"". I mean the music here is okay - but after the second spin, I'm honestly ready to put it up for the time being. Line-up: Chris Muis - vocals, Robert Mitchell - guitar & vocals, Rob Sephton - bass & vocals, Randy Kelley - keyboards and Dennis Hovenden - drums. Might appeal to fans of Jeronimo, Fields and possibly Sameti."
4,A decent book,"This is a good offering for all Linux fans out there.I have been running Linux under Windows 3.1 on my Mac for a long time now, and I recently upgraded the BIOS of my audio card to version 3.0413.This book provided me with some knowledge which was extremely useful given my system. With its help, I am planning to upgrade to Linux XP in the near future, provided I can find a compatible I/O driver."
4,Linux Server Hacks,"This well written guidebook covers a hundred real-life time saving scripts and command-line magic.Everything your local *nix guru knows that you don't; narrow the gap!Highlights include CVS commands, creating unchangeable files (even by root!), filteringand organizing apache log files (for example, listing the top 20 broken links, sortedand numbered by frequency of occurrence), modifying the titlebar to display load average,host, current directory, etc., ntop and httptop and much more.I've been using *nix for 6 years now, and I found this book both a refreshing review ofpreviously known concepts as well as a great introduction to some new utilities and tools."
5,Poor Man's VPN,The challenge: Accessing my Linux workstation at work from my Linux workstation at home.A colleage suggested I take a look at SSH port forwarding. I did a quick read through the man page and tried a few things to no avail. As I say back in frustration I noticed a book on my shelf that had say unread for several months. A quick scan of Linux Server Hack and I had a solution that allowed me to create a sort of poor man's VPN.Buy this book. Read it. It will pay for itself in increased productivity.
5,"Linux ""Must Have"" book for servers or desktop client","First, I write software professionally. I write software, I am not a Sys Admin (which is hard work I might add; System Administration is for hardcore people.) This book saved me money by giving me answers to problems that would have taken me days to find the answers to by searching the internet.Hack #17 includes ""pgrep""Before I was doing ""ps -elf | grep something"" to find a process I wanted to kill. Hack #17 explains a better way to do that with pgrep and things like ""skill""Simple enough but time is money in this business and this book save both time and money.Also the book is a ""good"" read. The author writes well and keeps you reading. Not a dry manual.If you are doing Linux for fun or work you need will need to buy this book. It allows you more time to sleep at night."
4,Quick and Handy Linux Admin's Guide,Gives clear and succint solutions to a set of common problems that Linux admins or users may run into. I like the cookbook style approach and the concise format.
4,A Time Saver,"Linux Server Hacks puts on paper a toolbox that can save any administrator time and headaches on their next project. Over the past 6 years, I have worked on many projects and have had to custom craft the solutions to all sorts of situations. On my first read of Linux Server Hacks, I found myself saying over and over again: ""I've done that,"" or ""That's a neat way of doing it,"" or ""Oh, that's what I should have done."" Now, after several times through, what I have learned is that this book saves me time--and should be kept close by."
4,Good Bang for your buck,"This series is a great place to start learning the some of the most useful aspects of linux in a networked environment. The examples used in the book are very well laid out and documented. My only gripe is that the subject is a little dated but overall it is still a very good book.This is a great reference book, power users will find this book helpful as well as the second edition. One can expect to learn some of the fundamentals of linux with this book; backup, network shares, hostkeys, centralizing, and some other nifty one off mini-programs. This won't replace a lot of hard work, but it will make you think how you can work smarter."
3,Disappointingly short book,"After living in Singapore and traveling in the region (including Indonesia) I purchased this book enthusiastically and believed it would contain much more. The book comprises a series of emails that the author sent to family members and friends overseas during her time in Indonesia. There is much to be told about Indonesia, and with a title like ""Adventures in Indonesia"" I really expected to find some adventure stories. There was little in the book that I could classify as adventures. Moreover, the book was very brief (perhaps 50 pages of content) so it only stratched the surface of a really interesting country. The author failed to tell much about things happening outside Jakarta, and left me with a big disappointment by the time I finished reading. I would not really recommend this book if you are looking for captivating stories taking place in Indonesia."
5,???????,"What's up with WCW after this PPV. The rest of the PPV before it went out of business were not released on VHS home video. I don't get how WCW went out of business. The rest of the PPV I believe is great even though I havent seen it.I'm talking about Halloween Havoc 2000, Mayhem 2000, Starrcade 2000, Sin 2001, Superbrawl Revenge 2001 & Greed 2001.I know It's all about Scott Steiner. Cause he beat Goldberg, Booker T, Sting, Sid Vicious, Kevin Nash & DDP throughout. Til Booker T beat him again at the final Nitro on 3.26.01. What I'm saying is that WCW should not be out of business. Cause I believe if they still alive, they might have a chance to beat the WWF from the ratings."
1,This video SUCKS,"This was the HORRIBLE period for WCW, not even Flair or Sting could save it. Skip over this video cause you will be completely bored..if you do happen to get it, however, just fast forward to War Games, the only watchable match on the tape. I'm out.."
2,IT WAS A JOLLY FINE PPV,UDALAY!!! YO YO YO... LET ME SPEAK ON DIS... UDALAY! THIS PPV WAS A LIL CHEASY BUT IT WAS BOW WOW WOW SO ITS GETS A 3 STAR RATING.
3,Fall Brawl,"I'm not a big wcw fan but I did like this event. The Goldberg and Steiner match was the best match on this tape. The Pittsburgh Plunge Match wasn't good at all! The falls were so fake with mudusa landing on some kind of cushon, I know it is all fake but that is the worst fall I have seen. Other then this one match this is event is worth watching."
3,Fall Brawl,"I saw this one on Pay Per View and this is what i thought... The cruiserweight match, the six man tag match and the goldberg/scott steiner match were good. The scaffold match, the 3-way dance, and the first blood chain match were crap. I thought the swereve in the US Title match was funny. The bunkhouse brawl was a great match, with appearances by the buffalo bills and Gary Coleman(yes Gary Coleman), the elimination tag match was good but stopped unfortunately to an injury, otherwise was a good match. In the main event Kevin Nash does a good job putting Booker T over in the steel cage. Overall this is a decent Pay Per View."
2,Pretty Lame,"An O.K. event. Dusty Rhodes, Hacksaw Duggan and The gaurdian Angel wrestling in this one kills the matches. War Games was good, but not a classic. The best thing about this PPV was that Hogan didn't wrestle in it."
1,No Warranty Coverage!!,"I purchased this battery back in April 2012. Trusting that Duracell would provide me a higher quality than the generics, I paid a premium price for the brand-name.Unfortunately, the battery died completely after only 6 months of use. Now I learn the battery is distributed by a company named BatteryBiz that is giving me the runaround for the warranty claim. Spending uncounted amount of time on the phone and e-mails, BatteryBiz is now blaming Amazon for not resolving the issue!! As of today, still no resolution. Ridiculous!!"
1,Not what you see,"Instead of sending the ""Duracell"" battery that was pictured they sent some cheap battery that others are selling for $1.55. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Strong effort,Never understood why Kevin Mahogany isn't any bigger. The man can sing. The WDR big band continues to be the best band out there. I can't find much wrong with this one. A fine swinging effort of standards that's sure to please. Worth the 5 bucks for the mp3. An hour of music you will certainly enjoy
5,Must Have,"What a great addition to the Blue Prints series. This tiny book teaches you step by step how to ""play the game"" of the Sim section of Step 3. If you can master this, the sim section will be a breeze...I had no surprises the day of the exam, and I thank this book for giving me the tools to crush it."
2,Cant say Im hugely impressed,I bought this book hoping that it would give me some advantage but it really wasnt that helpful in my opinion.
1,worthless purchase,"This book did not help with any preparation to attempting the CCS cases, your best option would be to print out the read out material provided by [...] and follow each each thoroughly in order to grasp the general gist and order of managment. I didn't find this book helpful at all. It was overpriced where I could have used that money to just extend the bank for the CCS cases."
5,Beautiful Sounds,"I love the music on this CD - especially the title hymn ""Seek Ye First"". I hope to hear more of this type."
1,Horrible tv,"Since we bought this tv, we have had nothing but problems with it and with Sharp. During the first month, we returned it to the store due to a banding issue. During the second month, we called the company to use the warranty to return it again due to the same banding issue. They sent us a new tv which came with yet another banding issue and dark vertical lines that looked like a burn in. We called the company to use the warranty again and they decided to send us the new model(64U), which we just received. This is our 4th tv which is not a new one, but a refurbished one, that came without the correct mounting screws and without a power cord. The only thing Sharp said they could do for us was send us the cord & screws, so in the meantime we are left without a tv."
5,Better than I thought.,I'm impressed. I watched Patton on it first and was blown away. Maybe I'll get to watch something in HD on it one day if I save my nickels.
1,poor quality,The book I purchased fell apart from the bing=ding the first time I opened it...very dissapointing!
4,Heavy and ahead of its time,"Finished With The Dogs is a great heavy metal album with excellent, suprising vocals. When I learned this album came out in the late 80s I was shocked, because it sounds like some of the ""extreme metal"" of 2008. A lot of it is fast and thrashy, and it's ultra poundingly heavy. If you're into metal, I highly recommend checking out Holy Moses on this CD."
3,"Good ideas, good heroine and a good story.","Why only three stars. Weeellll. At times I found the story was a little drawn out in places and was retelling what I alread knew. But what do you expect in a first novel? Perfection???So, this is a story of an earth that is dying of pollution (hey, that's us!) The population is doing nothing because the government and large corporations have it all under control. But they don't. They just don't want to panic the population.So, can a group of pilots ""Dive"" back to a fertile planet and bring back plants that can survive polluted earth, or are we going to fizzle out of existence?For the answer to that one you will just have to read the book."
2,A disappointment,"I found this book rambling and rather incoherent, and although there were a few clever plot ideas it wasn't all that engaging. Besides, the main character was for most of the book very unlikable, and the background was totally negative and depressing (Earth's environment ruined, government evil and corrupt, etc)."
4,Interesting. Good read if you like sci-fi/time travel.,The Seeds Of Time is set in the future when our planet Earth is on the verge of dying from lack of plant and animal life due to environmental abuse.Talanted people are sought to 'Dive' into the past to travel to distant planets and retrieve plant life & seeds that may be viable/fruitful here on Earth.Book is filled with many plot twists and action as the heroine attempts to alter time to save Earth.
1,Bleah.,"Reading the other reviews before paning this book, I realize I just must be getting jaded.Clio - the main character - didn't impress me as a strong character.The weird plot twists were just over the top. Everyone was so busy advancing their own agenda and lying to everyone else you just had no idea what was really going on. Except for the fact that there were good guys and bad guys. The good guys were on the side of right, and always lied for good purposes. The bad guys lied to advance their nefarious agendas.And this whole environmental apocalypse thing. Ho hum. _Sheep Look Up_ was sorta fun in that hysterical environmental sort of way. Having read that, _Seeds of Time_ fails to impress.And there are some fairly irrational plot twists to make the story - um - interesting (I found the whole bit rather annoying actually).Give this book a miss."
4,"fine british ""modern""","This, like many of the BBC recordings which I know of, is excellent. The cello soloist gives a lovely, human performance, the orchestra is exquisitely balanced. The Hindemith Variations are fantastic - a revelation to me, who of all of Walton's music I have heard - which is not much - have only ever liked the cello concerto. What's additionally great about this recording is there is a live feel to it. The sound does not feel doctored up, or augmented by any studio tricks. I only give it four stars because I don't like the sound of ""bel canto""- ie legitimate operatic singing tones in 20th century music. It doesn't work for me. You may love it."
1,Outrageous and shameful,"Matthew Rothschild has something to say about Israel's attempts to defend itself against Arab aggression in 2006.He says that he feels outrage and shame.Well, I feel outrage and shame too.I am outraged that people who could do something positive choose to participate in gratuitous attacks against their neighbors, in this case against Israel. And I feel shame that some of my fellow human beings could be proud of doing that. I also am outraged that people would side with the felons who perpetrate such violence.I am in favor of truth, justice, peace, and human rights for everyone. All of these are threatened if we praise aggression.I'm willing to discuss questions about the best way to fight back against aggression. But this article leaves me with nothing to discuss: there is no hint of the author allowing Israel to defend itself at all. He fails to indicate that the aggression against Israel so much as exists."

3,Superbrawl- A PPV that was all mixed up!,"I was at superbrawl this year and found it to just be a average PPV. Flair vs. Funk in a death match was the highlight of the night. Matches like Demon vs. Wall , 3 count vs. Smiley were filler and little else. THe order of matches was weird with the Sid vs jarrett vs Hall not having that main event feel. If you are a flair or funk fan then I say get it, they make you feel like your watching there feud from 89 all over again. If not take a chance on it you might be suprised."
2,SuperBrawl = Super Boring,"This event was good, for WCW, but that isn't saying a whole lot. The main event was cut way too short and all of the interference and the 6 referees that came in ruined it. Hogan vs. Luger adn Flair vs. Funk wre both the same thing to WCW. You whould never have old guys wretlign other old guys in matches that have already hapened 30 times before. There were some highspots in the Death Match, but not enough to cover up for the slow pace and weak action in the rest of it. THe one match I did enjoy was the Stretcher Match. THis match had four men putting on a great show using tables stretchers, and other various weapons in unique adn amazing ways. Crowbar put on a great show, doing just about anything ot entertain the fans. There were soem high spots at this event, but don't waste your time or money on it."
2,"Works OK, but doesn't compare to FLIP","I purchased the Small Wonder and the higher resolution version of the FLIP camera to evaluate for an educational video project. I read other reviews rating the FLIP much higher, but I wanted to see for myself. The other reviews were correct. The Small Wonder can't complete in either picture quality (it is especially weak in low light) or sound quality. The sound quality was surprisingly bad. I videotaped my son play the piano, and the distortion at playback made it difficult to listen to."
4,perfect for what I need,"I bought another Small Wonder about a year ago and it could only take 30 minutes of video with no memory card slot. I liked it but needed more time, so I returned it and got another camcorder. I did not like the other and missed the Small Wonder. I was very happy when I found this model becuase it does have a memory card. I think I've added 2 GB to this camera so I'll be set for Europe! I love the size, picture quality, and extra storage. I am not a professional nor do I use this all the time. It is perfect for the times I do use it. Not into high tech, so don't use this review to buy if you want something more complicated."
4,Good camera,"I bought this camera for my daughter's 16th birthday. It's a great deal for what you get. Uploads were easy, didn't take much to figure out how to use it and the quality isn't terrible. I wish it had a mute button for when people start asking questions while you are filming!"
5,It's Wonderful!!,"I love the Small Wonder - it's lightweight and takes very good videos. No more carrying around some heavy machinery to videotape your adventures. And the price was just right! The only small downside is you can't really zoom up on items, but you can get around that by walking up closer to whatever you're taping. Great for parties and saving memorable family moments."
5,Definitely a Small Wonder,"After showing it at work, at least 2 coworkers went out and got one. It doesn't replace a full featured movie camera, but it's really convenient. It fits in a pocket, uses easily replaceable AA batteries, and can take a memory card.It takes pretty good video in the normal mode but if you zoom in, the resolution is seriously compromised.All in all, for the convenience and price, I recommend it."
4,Great little camcorder,"I think this little gadget is great for everyday camcording. The picture is good in good lighting but a little grainy in low light. I considered the ""flip"" but for the same price the RCA has a flippable screen and an expansion slot, which I recommend purchasing with the camera, you will need it. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 for its size and ease of use."
1,Cannot edit videos! Corrupt files!,"I spent the summer taking videos with this camera, and then saving them on my WindowsXP machine. I've spent a week trying to get the stored .avi files from my Small Wonder to work with Windows Movie Maker and Auto Movie Creator. I'm unable to do this because of Critcal Failure, Runtime Errors. After days of correspondence with RCA, and researching the web, the conclusion is that you can ONLY edit your .avi RCA files with the RCA Memory Maker.........which is extremely limited to the point of being worthless. Don't buy this camera!"
3,Disappointed,"With great anticipation I bought the EZ 201 Small Wonder Camcorder. My main disappointment is that the colors are washed out and the images are not at all sharp. I happen to have an older model from Pure Digital, and its colors and sharpness are somewhat better than the newer model from RCA. Nevertheless, I will use it, but with less enthusiasm."
3,No Date/Time Stamp!,"This product doesn't have a date/time stamp. I thought they all did, so I wasn't even looking for that as I made my decision to purchase. Also, it doesn't pick up audio very well. I have to be within a couple feet of the camera to be heard. It doesn't work well in low light, even when there's still a bit of light out it records blackness.Other than that, this is an easy camera to use and is the right size to be portable."
3,It's nice,"This is a very good camera but in the days of HD you should not buy it unless it's for a child or an older person,that being said this is a solid camera and handles poor lit conditions better than alot of HD pocket camcorders"
3,negative points,The EZ201 is really an easy camera for us techno challenged people. But my soft ware had to be reloaded because I could not get the video portion on screen. People I send video to do not get them sometimes but that could be my fault. For the price it is great.
3,"Easy to use, but some problems.","We purchased this item because it was light weight, relatively inexpensive and with the 2 gig memory card could shoot 4 hours of video.Biggest problem was daytime shooting. With the sun at your back (as most shots are taken)it is virtually impossible to see the screen. This product could use a hood or mask to solve the problem.Also, the product does not come with a lot of information on how to use it with the 2 Gig card attached.But the video results we got were pretty good considering its size and simplicity."
4,RCA Small Wonder vs. Flip Ultra,"I recently purchased both cameras in November. I tried them both indoors and out. Here is my experience. Both cameras are extremely easy to use and upload videos to web sites like Youtube. The Flip Ultra seemed to take better indoor videos due to lower light settings. They are still grainy like the RCA just a tad better. Outdoors both seemed to do fine. After taking about 10 different videos, in different settings with both cameras, I found the Ultra to make a tiny bit better quality video. However, I ended up keeping the RCA because it was ALOT cheaper (Flip was $149 on sale and the RCA was $89 on sale), has the upgradable SD card slot and flip out screen. Keep in mind though that these are not camcorder quality cameras. These are meant to take close distance, well lit subject videos to easily email or upload to Youtube using the built in software."
3,"Easy to use, OK video","The ergonomics of this device are pretty good. Simple buttons to do all common operations, no complex setup menus. The power switch does tend to get pushed by accident if you put it in your pocket though.Video quality is OK, and works well for small size playback, but is not good for larger screen viewing. The MPEG4 compression makes things reasonably small, but given the mediocre quality, I would have expected the movies to take less memory than they do. The colors are somewhat washed out, compared to the movies my old Canon digital camera took. The low cost makes this a good camera to let my kids use. I wouldn't use itfor anything I really wanted to treasure though."
4,"Very cool, just add an SD card & rechargable batteries","We need to record 2hr meetings - this is small, cheap, easy to use, decent quality picture in HQ, OK quality in LP. The built-in 512MB memory is limiting, we got a 2GB SD card for under thirty that adds space for recording more. It uses up a pair of AA batteries in one hour. We got four rechargables so we can record for two hours. There's no mic jack but the built-in mic is very good, it's sensitive enough to pick up speech at 12ft. The built-in USB jack and six inch USB extension cable make it easy to connect to the computer to copy the AVI movie files. The software included in the camera is not required if you know how to copy a file from one drive to another. We think the EZ201 can replace our old VHS camcorders."
4,Cool camera,"This cool little camera won me over when I learned it had a slot for SD cards. Video quality is good when used in well-lit places. Video taken in low light gets blocky. Bottom line: this ""2001: A Space Odyssey""-looking camera is priced right. You won't stop using your main video camera, but for the price, you get a fun camera that you can always have with you."
2,Turns off when bumped.,"Buddy & I mounted this to a hang glider to film his flight. His landing was a bit of an event and we were eager to see the playback. However, we received a ""File error"" message & no video. Subsequent experimentation yielded the discovery that the camera would turn off when in the ""record"" mode if bumped by a rap of the knuckles. If you plan to mount this cam as a ""sport camera"" (on a bike or motorcycle, e.g.) you may want to test it first. Striking the bottom portion of the camera (as in knocking on a door) was more likely to cause a power off situation."
1,RCA Small Wonder Poor Quality Video,"The Video quality of this camera is definitely sub-standard. No detail, fuzzy outlines, pinkish tints to whites and other light colors. RCA/Thomson refused to do anything for us but a direct exchange. Not a viable solution for us.Others have encountered the same Video problems....see the Consumer Reports comments below.""Poor video quality. While recordings looked passable when viewed on the Small Wonder's tiny display, they deteriorated when viewed on any TV screen. Given the very low bit rates of these digital recordings, that's not surprising. The stair-step-edged video looked much like clips from video-capable cell phones. Even recordings shot in the high-quality mode in good lighting looked very soft, without much detail. Dim lighting, zoom, and the LP mode made things look worse."""
1,poor customer service,"Please be warned. The website for RCA does not provide a contact phone #.When you make a request by email, it is an automated response. You are then given a contact#, but it is difficult to navigate automated system. I was disconnected on several ocassions. I was able to speak to an accociate eventually. They were unable to offer service repair in our area.Very dissapointed with procuct that broke after 3 months use but even more dissapointed with customer service."
4,Worth it for off-road fans,"When my roommate moved out and took his PS2, the series of ATV: Off Road Fury games were the only games I really missed that X-Box didn't have. MXvATV:U more than fills the void.The race stategy is much more than ""mash-the-gas"" and go. On the hard or 100% difficulty settings you have to really work the track to get a win. Nothing like losing that 3 second lead you worked on for the last 10 laps because you got greedy and over-jumped the last berm. Maybe not for all gamers but if you like off-road rhythm racing and getting sweet air, this game is for you. The other machines (like planes) are fun for a short time but are mostly an amusing gimmick. The MX bikes and ATVs are the real show."
2,Its ok,"I got it because it was cheap, it was alright. I would recommend a different game,its one on the 360 i would recommend"
4,Fun! Fun!,This is a fun game. Even my 3 1/2 year old has fun driving the trucks and planes around. Great for rainy days.
3,Not bad,"After playing it a few days, I think the game is ok. I was expecting the game to be as good as ATV off road fury 2 but the game seems simplier and not as much fun. It's not bad, but its just not great....in my opinion."
5,MX vs. ATV unleashed,"This game is amazing! I bought it 2 days ago and have been playing it ever since. The MX races are cool but I haven't tried the ATV races yet. The amount of extras like gear and vehicles is amazing. You can race in helicopters, planes, dune buggies, sand rails, monster trucks, trophy trucks, and golf carts, as well as bikes and ATV's. The graphics are pretty good and the free ride is awesome. Overall the game gets a 5 out of 5. You need to get up and buy this game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't waste you money,I bought this product excited to begin preparing purees for my infant..I tossed in some sliced apples which it barely was able to process. I was also surprised it didn't come with instructions or quick meal plans. I think the product isn't worth it..you're better off investing in a regular food processor all together. Thank goodness I was able to return it.
4,Baby food made easy!,"I really like this product. I have 3 children and never used a food processor until now (my 3rd baby). I realize I spent so much money on jarred foods that I didn't need to.It was simple, put the food in (you can add a little liquid if you want it smoother - but i found it wasn't absolutely neccessary). Push the top down and presto - in about 10 seconds you have baby food.easy to clean, comes apart very easily and goes back together easily.There are only 4 parts- the container the food goes in, the blade, the cover and the motor. Nothing to lose.I reccomend this product to anyone who is short on time (3 kids (12, 3, 8mos), my husband and I both work full time +, swimmng lessons, 2 pets, needless to say we got alot going on and making the food actually makes life easier w/ this product!"
4,great so far,"I used this in combination with a baby food cookbook, I steam everything first, and then just run it thru the processor. I have made fruit and veggies so far, and they all turn out great. The only downfall is that the directions that come with it are very basic. They do not mention steaming anything first, and this step is necessary for your babys tummy and for it to ""mush"" up. It really makes the entire process very easy."
4,It's easy but not great for batches,It is a good processor but it's just too small to really be able to do much more than nightly food processing. It's impossible for big batches and I think most of us moms who are making our own baby food are making it in big batches. I got a large food processor for Christmas last year and I'll be making this little one's baby food from that one. It's just too small!
4,Good Processor,"We are cooks who like to prepare meals made from the freshest ingredients; we figured that we should do no less for our son. This blender does an OK job. It purees the food well, although sometimes we also have to scrape the food back into the center to puree it further."
4,Baby Food Processor,This processor is very convenient. It's compact too so it's easy clean up. I really like it. It will be even better when my baby is able to handle #2 foods with some chuncks.
2,It smokes,"Every time I've used it, it smokes and makes the food taste a little burned. I've tried only pulsing it for short periods, to see if that keeps it from over heating, but to no avail. If I could choose all over again, I'd spend a little more and get a small Cuisinart processor."
2,Does the job...but has a critical design flaw,"This blender does a great job blending the food but the design is flawed. I can only assume that they intended to simplify use by skipping a button or switch. What you do instead is push-down the top part (motor) into the base where the blade is balanced on a metal tip. The problem is that the motor starts before the top and blade are secure. The result is two plastic pieces that aren't moving in harmony; and the gears grind down .... game over.You can make this work without the grinding of the gears only if a. you always combine the two parts perfectly or b. unplug before snapping together.In our case, my wife wasn't properly licensed and she seems to grind the gears every time :) The unit lasted about two weeks. We use an immersion blender now."
2,not so pleased,"I was looking forward to using this product along with my baby food making kit but this food processor seems to only be able to handle very small quantities of food. By small quantities I mean maybe 2-4 ounces at a time to be able to puree the food. I was quite disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan on only making small quantities of food or food on a daily basis for your little one. Otherwise, it does it work."
1,"Weak, dangerous, and poorly designed","My mother purchased this for me from TJmaxx or Ross or something. I've learned to be very suspicious of baby products from those places- seems like they've usually had some sort of issue and no one will buy them any more and sometimes those issues are dangerous like with this product.I think this blender is pointless. One could do much better buying a small food processor from Target or something. This Dex one is also cheaper at walmart online. This blender is weak, doesn't blend very quickly or efficiently. I'm horrified to read the reviews and learn about the plastic ring which I cannot find in mine! I guess I fed my baby plastic! Mine's been sitting in a plastic bag ready to go to Goodwill. Maybe I should just throw it away.It's a piece of junk that ends up in Ross because it's a poorly designed product. Do your baby a favor and buy a BPA free one somewhere else, and freeze your baby food in tiny Pyrex."
1,Plastic ring blended into food with 1st use!,"I bought this little machine with the idea of making healthy baby food. The first time I used it resulted in potential disaster! The plastic ring fell of and blended into the baby food! My husband, not wanting to waste our first efforts with organic pears, decided to eat it and found that nearly every bite contained at least one piece of plastic! I am amazed that this product exists!"
1,Warning choking,This is a great processor for baby food!!! The warning is that there is a plastic seal in the lid that contains the blade that is removable. Beware that it can slip out and become part of the baby's food with out notice. This did occur and plastic had to pass through my daughter.Buyer Beware.The company had little response.Dee
3,Written too quickly,"I hope there are better books on this topic somewhere out there. Yes, I passed the exam using this book plus practice exams from Boson. Yet I found that there was too much repitition, the use of terms was inconsistent and confusing, and the very poor coverage of commands is (IMHO) appalling. The ""case studies"" at the end of the chapters were fine, but the lack of detailed command information that should have been there, wasn't. If you are a Cisco Press or Cisco diehard (and there are a lot of them out there), you'll be happy with this book. But, from an objective standpoint, this book isn't a very good one."
2,Push it out the door.....,"My impression is that it was quickly written and not very well thought out. The flow of the information is poorly organized, and the examples, diagrams, and terms are buggy. I haven't taken the CCNP test yet, but this book scares me. I've been networking since the early days of ""thin-net"" and perhaps I am thinking beyond the scope of the book... All in all not a very scientific endeavor."
5,Great Book,"I just cleared the BCMSN test today, nov 27, 2000. The test was very fair, certainly not the hardest I have taken. The book does a great job at explaining all the concepts needed to pass the exam, AND apply some hands on knowledge for the ""real world"" . The chapter on multicast was especially useful. I would definately reccomend this book. Also, I bought the Boson self test from Boson.com, not very useful, alot of ambigious stuff in them, save your money, this book is all you will need."
4,NOT A BAD BOOK,"Used this book to study for and pass BCMSN. It covered about 70% of the exam, more or less. It is well worth the money. Don't use it as the sole study guide for the exam. I used some CD training also to study."
3,well? ..,"there is no under current of continutity for the most part . Be prepared to read and reread certain sentences. The excercises at the end of the chapters are unrealistic for the guy who can't get access to a half dozen high end switches by the end of chapter four...fortunately for moi, i have a gifted imagination. Still luv you though karen, you know that."
4,Passd the 640-604 with a 900 with this book,"I used this book along with one Boson practice test and passed with a score of 900 on the first sitting. It tracks very well with the contents of the exam.The chapters are fairly easy to follow having to go back and re-read only a couple of them. There are some terms that are used inconsistently but they would not prevent anyone from passing the test. The case studies at the end of each chapter seem pointless except for those that have several Catalyst 6500s lying around.I found the information in Appendix B to be very useful, although it is not covered in the exam. It explains some of the terms that Cisco's web site often uses but never defines.Overall, this book is well worth the money spent. There is no need to spend the cash for a second book when studying for the 640-604. It has all the information needed for this exam but you will need to have a solid understanding of it to do well. Good luck!"
4,"Easy to understand, but inconsistently edited","This is one of the better-written Cisco Press books I've read. I read the book over an otherwise quiet weekend, and passed the CCNP Switching test _easily_ the following Tuesday. The material is presented pretty well, and it covered all the key content.The book does suffer from some errors missed (or introduced?) in the editing process; this is a typical Cisco Press issue. If you've read many CP books, you know what to expect (i.e. frequent errors in examples and figures.) Maybe they consider it a learning tool (e.g. find the mistakes...) It's annoying, but not overly problematic, in this particular book."
3,adequate to pass,"After reading the Cisco Press BSCN, this book was a little disappointing. I felt that it needed more explanations and examples. Some examples made no sense. Chapter reviews are good. You may need supplemental material for this one."
4,Get on the CCNP 2.0 track!,"The tests are now updated. This book will get you up to speed! It is also a great at-hand reference for multi-later switching, vlans, spanning tree, and multicasting."
4,A good study guide,"If you are preparing yourself for Cisco's Switching exam (640-504), or you just want to know more about Cisco's switches, this is a very good book. It has helped me towards my CCNP 2.0 certification. However, at this price, it should at least have a CDROM with sample questions."
4,Building CISCO Multilayer Switched Networks,"The book is generally very good. There is a wealth of detailed information presented in an understandable manner. Providing you have some knowledge of networking you shouldn't have to many problems.My one gripe about this book is the amount of mistakes, There everywhere, from wrong IP addresses in diagrams, bad descriptions to plain wrong content. I know this because I've read the book five times along with many many documents available on the CISCO web site. So if you doubt what you read check it.At the end of the day there are very few good books around that cover the BCSN exam in detail. This one does"
5,Test Passed!,I purchased this book because I had taken the BCMSN course but the course material content was full of errors. I had taken the Beta exam and missed passing by only a few points so I had an idea of what to study. This book is easy to read. Not as dry as a lot of other material and had pertinent information. I recommend this book as well as some lab time/hands on switch time and review for passing Cisco 640-504 switching test.
2,Not what I expected,"Another review said big thump, well the mid's and highs sound great, but no thump, i'm very disappointed. I'll be looking into a Amped sub, guess thats the only way to good Bass sounds"
5,great sounding speakers,"didn't expect much from these speakers, man was wrong! hooked them(4) up to a 800 watt amp in my buggy in a sealed box and they are almost to loud.i haven't regretted purchasing them yet. base is crisp and tight, highs are loud and piercing! perfect for my 63 VW street buggy with open exhaust.never thought i would hear music over those pipes!"
4,"catchy, classic for the very young","My boys love this book (and the video). Leans toword Arminianism and pre-millennialism, but otherwise complete sound. Christian world view was never this fun and simple!"
2,Needs color,Not happy with the black and white pages. Wish it was in color like the actual book. My daughter lost interest in the Kindle version.
3,A is for Adam,"I am not crazy about this book. The message is fine. I didn't like that a cute little ""pet-type"" lamb was shown with blood around it. The message is accurate - but distressful for little ones."
5,very interesting,"I was unsure on how to make a profit in the market while protecting my investment, until I read this book. Sy Harding explains (in terms that I can understand) the ins and outs of investing. Anyone interested in the markets should definitely read this book."
2,"Should have been titled ""Dodging the Bear""","This book is all about avoiding bearish turns in bull markets, and not, as the title claims, about profiting from bear markets.While the first half of the book is full of substantial and enlightening advice about reducing risk in bull markets, Harding offers only a meager 10 pages or so of light commentary on tools for profiting in down markets, namely short-selling and put options.Having introduced short-selling and put options, he quickly abandons the subject, with barely a word of advice on how long to hold a short position, and not one word of guidance on executing an options trade.If you want to learn how to avoid bear turns in bull markets, this book is worth the price.But if you want to learn how to execute profitable options trades and short sales in a bear market, you won't find this book helpful."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK,NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK - COMPLAINTS DID NOTHING BUT WAISTE MY TIME AND MY TIME IS WORTH MORE THAN A $10 BOOK
3,Hire a professional,I wish someone would realize that we all don't want our entire yard taken up with an outdoor kitchen. The directions were okay but save your money. Go buy a decent grill and have fun!
2,less then expected,"i bought this charger to be able to charge my tablet in my truck. knowing that many usb/car chargers won't work with tablets, I hoped this one actually would. It does not. Information implies it should, but it does not charge my asus tablet in the car. a bit bulky to be a great travel charger."
3,"Really bulky, works ok","I didn't realize quite how bulky these items would be - they both take up more space in a glove box or whatnot than expected. They work ok, but we have already replaced them with something that has a slimmer profile. Still have these as a fall back, because it wasn't worth sending them back."
4,good quality,"This is a good quality jelly although I found it at one of those dollars stores for, of course, much less."
5,"""Reconstruction"" is a powerful read.",Everything you could possibly want to know about reconstruction -- a powerful narrative leaving you hoping for book two. The absolute best source on this topic.
3,Everything you wanted to know about Reconstruction,"Eric Foner is a marvelous scholar. Unfortunately, as a writer, he is still a marvelous scholar. Like so many academics, he has failed to learn a crisp, clear writing style that ""popular"" historical writers like Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough learned early in their careers. The sheer amount of data in Foner's book is like wanting a bath but getting a tidal wave (although I have read even more brutal academic writing than Foner's). I believe Dr. Foner would have gotten the point across much better with more focused information and clearer writing. His book on the rise of the Republican Party, by the way, is as just thorough and just as hard to read. Buy all Foner books and keep them handy for reference, but do not expect them to offer you an enjoyable reading experience unless you are steeped in the rhetoric of academia."
4,"Heavy, dense reading, but worth it","If you read Battle Cry of Freedom and want to read the sequel, here it is. The book is every bit as detailed and scholarly, and presents the era extremely well. The problem is that where Battle Cry covered the Civil period chock full of intriguing characters, major events, and familiar territory, Foner must work with a very muddled and confusing time in American history. The test of a good writer is whether s/he can make sense of a difficult topic, and Foner does an excellent job. A recommended read for serious students of American history."
4,Great indepth book on a very confusing period!,This book sums up the post Civil War period. The South and how it dealt with the Reconstruction Army and the Freedmen's Bureau. Very well researched!
1,An example of what is wrong with academic history today,"Eric Foner's Reconstruction is an example of what is wrong with academic historical writing today. It is overwritten, under-edited, and it in no way provides an adequate synthesis of the period. It, therefore, fails to promote a better understanding of the period for anyone without a fair amount of previous knowledge of this era."
1,Corruption was good for the American soul?,"Eric Foner once again displays his bias in yet another revision of history, this time the Reconstruction Era. Foner ignores the abuses wrought by corrupt politicians and a military regime determined to wreak vengeance on former Confederate States, and the many violations against ordinary southern citizens.In Foner's mind, Reconstruction was a benevolent institution that did everything possible to advance race relations and institute equality (then why did black women not get the vote along with black men?) in the racist south. Never mind that slavery had also existed in the north, and that racism was just as prevalent in the Union States.Whatever your view of history, one cannot argue that this work breaks no new ground and doesn't tell even the pro-Reconstruction camp anything that they didn't know before. Unfortunately it will likely prove popular in today's oh-so-politically-correct history classrooms."
5,excellent product,"Solid, well-designed, heavy-gauge stainless steel, a lid that fits any (8-10-12"") pan. This is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations. Not only for Faberware pans. I bought 8"" and 10"" lids for a Circulon non-stick skillet and a Macys stainless steel skillet, and both fit perfectly. Use them for my 2 cast iron skillets also. My only wish is that they'd make a 6"" lid in this line too!"
4,Know the time while you sleep,"The whole idea of a projection clock seemed a bit silly to me. After using this clock, I am hooked. It is easy to tell the time on the cieling. It also helps me sleep better, because I don't have to turn over to look at a clock on my nightstand. I also like the fact that this clock tells me the temperature and humidity outside.It just works great! In fact, when I travel, I miss having it!The only change I wish they made to it is giving more adjustments on the projection pivot. Sometimes people will straighten my night stand and change the location of the projected image without knowing it.Also, I wish the clock had a superbright mode to adjust the projected image with the lights on. Those are just wishes though. It is a great product."
3,Least exciting of this authors three books,Delirium of the Brave and Wassaw were great books especially if you are from that part of the country while No enemy but time was quite slow when compared with the other two
3,"Great Framework,but needed more flesh on the bones","No one doubts this gentleman knows his territory.I've walked the streets,squares and forts of Savannah.He does fine with that part.I think the book needed to be much longer.Maybe then he could have explained the combination of monster,hero and civic dynamo that the main actor is.People were too black and white,pardon the pun.Too one dimensional.I kept wanting more.Some plot lines just petered out,some people just fell off the map,so to speak.I wanted more CHARACTER in my charactors.I enjoyed the book,glad I read it."
1,Pretty Bad,"If you frequent the local shops of Tybee Island and Savannah, you find a plethora of self-published novels by local writers all trying in their own small way to hatch the next MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL,That is what NO ENEMY BUT TIME reads like. How a major publisher ever put its imprint to anything this poorly written is beyond me."
2,interesting but overworked/contrived,"Wm. Harris picks up with characters from his last novel Delirium of The Brave. His writing isn't bad, but at times he over works his characters. In addition, Harris walks a thin line between reality, fact and fiction. Having grown up just outside of Savannah in the late 40s and practicing law there in the early 1970s, I've heard some of his story before. Aside from a few editing and plot problems, the book is ok. However, I'd rather spend my money and time elsewhere."
2,"I wouldn't call it ""garbage,""","but it ain't no great shakes either. OK, Homes doesn't like LA, and for the same reasons many don't. But she's the novelist, and she's the one who got asked to write the book, OK? That's no reason not to like it. What's far more revealing, though, is that Homes apparently had no idea of where to go in this book or how to organize it, so she just kind of jumps all over the place, even going to a first-person interview format in places, which is pretty disjointing to the reader. The other thing is that, upon reading this, you understand that Homes is nearly as neurotic (some would merely say nuts) as a lot of the characters in her books. Her abberations and just plain weirdness are right out there, and, unfortunately, they're nothing to be boastful of.She talks about the hotel as if it's a sacred place, when all it is is another exorbitantly overpriced LA hotel that has a tad more charm than some others.AM, stick to fiction. And maybe some therapy?"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE.,"Don't waste your time and money on this piece of excrement. Ms. Homes HATES L.A. and lets the reader know it all the time. She knows nothing of the history of Chateau Marmont. She also has an ego so huge it wouldn't fit into Arrowhead Pond. No dear, it's not REALLY a pond! The writer refers to herself more than once as an ""intellectual from the East."" Usually when someone speaks so highly of themselves it's frequently because no one else does. Ms. Homes is like the one irritating girl in class that knows EVERYTHING and lets you know she knows everything all the time. If you want to read a truly splendid book about the Chateau Marmont pick up ""Life at the Marmont"" and don't waste any time and money on this one. My copy will be on the garbage truck in the morning. If I could have chosen NO STARS I would. A.M. Homes you are a disgrace."
5,Tremendo Disco,"Celebrando cuatro decadas. esta agrupacion lo celebro en grande con dos conciertos masivos en el pasado 27 y 28 de abril en Puerto Rico. Cantaron casi todas se sus mejores canciones, porque son tantas. Algunos temas fueron agrupadas en medleys. Uno de esos medleys fueron interpretado por Gilberto Santa Rosa, otra pro Andy Montanez, y las demas entre Charlie Aponte y Jerry Rivas, los cantantes presentes. El sonido fue bastante bien por un disco en vivo. Si eres fanatico de El Gran Combo o de salsa de la buena, este disco es digno de comprar."
4,Good Intro / Overview of Hebrews,"Hagner does a decent job of digging deeper into the book of Hebrews. This book is a great way to step into the vast array of literature on the book of Hebrews that is out there. The major issues in Hebrew's are covered from a fairly conservative angle. Hagner does not hide what he believes, but does point out what many sides to the different issues in Hebrews are.The side conversation windows are helpful in going farther on certain points such as perfection and others. This book is going to get you a lot farther in your study of Hebrews than a bible dictionary or some crackpot online commentary. Well worth your time, if you are interested. JVD"
4,Movie for nephews and nice,I have not seen this item purchased as I sent it as a gift. My sister said that it looked good and they kids liked it. Delivery was timely.
4,Geoff Wilson's Complete book of Fishing Knots & Rigs,"Este es un libro internacional, especial para aquellas personas que están interesadas en mejorar sus tecnicas de armado de equipos de pesca. Aunque es un libro en inglés, para los guías de pesca de habla hispana les será de mucha utilidad. Con lo que respecta a los dibujos de pesca son extremadamente detallistas y faciles de seguir. Considero que es uno de los mejores libros, su costo, la calidad del papel y el trabajo en dibujos y la forma sencilla de escribir permite es un libro obligado de trabajo de todos los guias de pesca y de los pescadores deportivos."
4,worthwhile addition,"I was tired of pouring pasta into a strainer...this makethings much easier...The first few times I used it, I had the problem others mentioned of the cover not locking into place and falling off. After a little experienc, its not problem. You have to:1) apply a little force to the handles2) make sure the hole line up to spill out the waterUsed it for almost a year -- no problems with it."
1,Not for glass top burners,I received one of these (or at least I think is the same one). It has a ridged bottom (non-flat). When I started to boil the water is shook back and forth!
5,satisfied,great pricing & item arrived before estimated due date which is amazing at christmas time. would definitely shop with seller in the future.
1,Refused claim - would not cover wear and tear,"This is a complete rip-off.I ordered it for some nice headphones I bought. 10 months later, one of the ear-pieces stopped working. Even though the description claims it will handle ""failures caused by normal wear and tear"", the person I spoke with said that since the manufacturer's warranty was still in place they would not cover it. I spent an hour calling the manufacturer and they wouldn't cover it as it was caused by normal wear and tear and not a defect (which is all they cover).I called the warranty provider back and they refused to take my claim, saying that they were only an extension of the manufacturer's warranty. I read them the description from the product page saying it covered failures for normal wear and tear, but they still refused to do anything. I did the standard ""can I talk to your manager ?"" and she also said they would not cover it."
1,no show !!!,I paid good money for the replacement plan which should have been delivered around 26-29 June. It is now July 19th & I still have not received it !!!!
1,Location,"I recently purchased an Ipod Shuffle, and decided that it'd be nice to have a replacement plan on such an expensive device. This was suggested to me, but I was never linked to this page at the time of the purchase. I didn't see until finally having problems with the device four months later that I was unavailable for service because of my location; I'm a resident of Maine. Sure, I should have read the details and its partly my fault, but I don't feel enough was done to notify people of restricted areas."
1,a rip off company,i bought the extended warranty but never received anything in writing. i was told on two separate occasions it had been sent. i finally filed a complaint with amazon and got a refund. two weeks went by and the company emailed me again telling me the warranty had been sent. i never received anything at all. to tell me it had been sent after i got my money back proved what a very poor lack of communication they have there.
4,ratings,"i received papers in a quick time, did not have to uae it yet, but i good to have a good piece of mind."
1,When will I see it?,I have yet to see the plan come in the mail. I hope that wasn't $10 thrown away.
3,Feminism in Higher Education,"Without a doubt, this book offers some helpful and provocative thoughts about feminism in higher education. Although the title leads one to believe that the book will cover many disciplines, it primarily focuses on feminism in literature courses. Nonetheless, the book is still valuable both as a pedagogical and feminist reference source. This book is a compilation of essays by many authors so the reader can pick and choose whichever ones interest her. Many pertinent topics are discussed in these essays including the nature of personal writing, how submissions to feminist journals can possibly derail one's career, and how one can be a catalyst for change in the classroom and out."
4,A historical look at chick sexing in Australia,"This book doesn't claim to teach chick sexing, although it does have a section at the back showing ""eminences"" (the distinguishing features between cockerels and pullets). It shows the history of chick sexing in Australia (with less emphasis on the rest of the world), from the development of chick sexing in Japan to the end of the 20th century. It also describes the difference between the classical cloacal sexing and the later ""machine"" sexing, and a slight nod to feather-sexing and sex-linked colors.I particularly enjoyed the interviews with the pros in the field. Things have changed greatly from the early days of hatching, when there was no way to distinguish cockerels from pullets until they started growing their adult plumage."
1,So bad its good,"When my brother bought this compilation ~10 years ago he was dazzled by the games the package in office depo displayed.In short, there was a good game or two out of the 300. I used the worst games to find ways to annoy my brother and he eventually was driven to destroy the disc completely or face complete insanity... These ""worst"" types of games were in no short supply.Overall even though I didn't buy it the entertainment value was definitely worth it. If you like things that are so bad they are good you may find something here.Otherwise, stay away. Far, far away."
3,Some nostalgic games for me but probably complete crap for others,"Well, back when stores were bold enough to put this on a shelf (although being Office Depot they never really had good taste in games anyhow) I begged my parents to get this for me. When you put the disk into the computer it brings up a giant scrolling list of a bunch of game names, being mostly compiled of shareware games, so not all of them are full. The games range from crappy internet flash games to full 3D not so popular games.To actually enjoy these games you have to pretend your back in that time where you couldn't afford anything and each game you got was a blessing. for me? sure $3 used is good enough for some nostalgia"
4,Educational and fun.,"Although you can see this on PBS, it's great to have Super Why viewing at our convenience. Alpha Pig is the best."
5,Super!,My daughter LOVES Super Whyy and she liked this Christmas edition. It is in the same format as the regular shows.
3,so-so,"It is a good DVD, but not easy use it in DVD player and my 4ys boy doesn't like it. I think that is so-so one."
4,Perfect WITHOUT subtitles,My boys love Super Why! I purchased this DVD so they could start to understand the upcoming holiday season. So far so good. I would have given the DVD a perfect score if the subtitles wouldn't automatically turn on after every episode. You have to go back to the settings before each episode and turn the subtitles off. I can only hope it's my DVD and not the way they put it on the market?
5,"A must have book - for school, professional and life","This book has a great deal of information that is well laid out and easy to understand. Of course, like all learning it is only as valuable as the learner makes it. The information and strategies must be accepted, internalized and PUT INTO PRACTICE in order to be of any real value, so that is all in the ""eye of the beholder."" For me, I found it was one of the better textbooks for my graduate courses (if not the BEST) and ironically, I experienced a LIFE CHANGING upheaval during the course and this book proved an invaluable resource in handling the most difficult situations of my lifetime. I am not sure where I would have been without the learning it had afforded me prior to these events. BUY IT! If you do the work, you will not be sorry."
2,out of stock,I never received it they told me they was out of stock so I had to go else where and rent a book:(
5,AND WHAT A RUSSIAN SOUL!,"One of the first recordings by this absolutely dynamic young baritone. 'For the Shores of Your Distant Homeland' and 'The Love of a Dead Man' are enough to send shivers up one's spine, and the more delicate songs come across with appropriate tone and control. The Hvorostovsky disc I would recommend for someone listening for the first time."
2,Not the first book to buy. Better for professional than parents...,"If you are new in the topic, this is not one of the first books you should buy, there are other books more complete, you can search inside the books. This is a book for professional not for parents."
3,"for the coffee table, not the library","A book of beautifully-presented photography by a pair of the regions foremost botanical photographers, this is a great coffee-table book and a basis for conversations and discussion, but does not present an in-depth description and discussion of the subject. However, from the title, the casual shopper wouldn't know this isn't intended as a field-guide."
5,Sting Vs Vampiro in match from hell.,"This is a five star PPV because of two matches. The first is a best of 5 table contest, in which one of the contestants (The Franchise or The Wall) loses if they are put though 3 tables, it ends with the two on the top of a 25 feet ladder with one of them falling though 2 tables on the floor below. The other match is one i belive should be crowned as the best match in wrestling history. It is Sting Vs Vampiro in a blow torch match, in which one of the contestants loses if they are set on fire, ok the WWF has already done an inferno match but this is so much better because the blow torch can be carried around the arena. This match ends with Sting getting covered in gas, set on fire and falling 75 feet off the scaffolding to the stage below. The other matches seal the fact that this is a great PPV."
3,A good pay per view,"I'm not a big WCW fan but this tape does have a few good matches. The main event was a good match if it wasn't for all the interfences it had. Nash and Jerrett did a good job, but Jerrett was never a good wrestler I cat't believe Wcw would make a champion, I guess that's why WCW went out of bussiness. The best match was Sting vs. Vampiro in the Human Torch Match. I would suggest you rent this first, or find a cheaper copy."
2,RENT IT FIRST Then Buy It,This Pay-per-view is probably one of the lamest and lousiest ppv wcw ever booked and no wonder WCW went out of business. From the Chavo/Disco opening upto Flair/David Match. Out of the ten matched booked only the human torch match and the world title match surpising ending. Well I must admitt the ambulance match was okay. If you're a die-hard wcw fan you'd probably get disappointed since the Bischoff/Russo era was supposed to turn things around so if you want my advice...RENT IT FIRST then make the desicion.
3,ok...,"not what i expected , its , big. maneul sucks. really its a big piece of plastic with a speaker in it. worth it? as long as the speaker holds out meybe but you prity much just paid for just the pritty looks. it sounds good no lie , but we'll see how long that last. becarful on which one you buy theres one that comes with an amp and one that dosent. this one ... hollow as a dead tree. the hold down straps kinda suck , they 'er hard to pull tight but if you loop it once through the buckle , unlike the book says , its stays pritty secure. ill probly linex the tank later and put a marine subwoofer in it.good luck"
2,Bottom of the Line Quality,"This turkey is going BACK! The hydraulic pistons were leaking right out of the box and still leaking after a few uses. Beyond this failure, I still am wanting for anything good to say about this jack besides it's moderately light weight. Compared to my old Craftsman 3.5 ton jack, it is inferior several ways (a lot of loose tolerances and play, for starters). Waste of my time."
3,Mediocre,"No problem with the pardue design, but the production quality is lacking here. Blade came way off centered. Probably will not buy from Benchmade again."
3,Posey Personal Pager Review,The pager is as described in the promotion being easy to use. The belt pager is bulky when you have to carry around with you. There are other pager receivers much smaller and in a wrist watch format which would be more desirable to have to carry around. Battery life is unknown at this stage. Item ok but could be improved.
4,Hopeful,Easy to operate. Seems like it will do the job of communicating a need for help as long as the receiver is turned on. Probably will have a learning-to-use-it curve. Bought this for elderly parents. Now they have to remember to use it.
5,THE POWERPUFF GIRLS ARE READY TO COME OUT OF YOUR VIDEO!,This video is EXCELLENT! It's the BEST VIDEO I EVER BOUGHT! My favourite episode is Uh-Oh...Dynamo and the others are the BEST! You should buy this video.
3,Powerpuff Bluff,This particular segment powerpuff bluff stunk. Who would ever believe this premise? I surely didn't and it wasn't funny either. I seriously had to consider whether I would let my son watch this because of the level of nasty humor in it. But I did think the other short toons were funny.
1,Dragon Ball Z with girls,"I totaly hate this show it's so stupid all that happens is these girls must go fight some $#@!ing villan whos power is incredbily stupid. The crator created this show after Dragon Ball Z came on and copyed it with girls shooting blast at stupid villans monkeys, lobsters, dolls, squids etc. The show has no value to it and is 30 minuits in a world of nothing but dumb and stupid pointless andevntures. Lucly the show only had like 35 epsoides while Dragon Ball Z had 276 in your face Power puff poops!!! The movies is 100 time worse then this. And why did the pafussors elbow hit that cemical x which is so stupid is he like drinking beer every hour or what? This show is just stupid and don't buy it and also stay atleast 50 feet away from it."
1,a guy who knows how bad this is,"what is with you people, I mean this show has a lot really stupid parodies of other shows which is so boring. they keep using shapes for the people heads in this show like the professor. he always has a square head and square ears which is mess up just like the powerpuffs. why do the girl always win so stupidly, they have no weakness which so off!!and what is with that monkey, why don't they just shoot down the that monkey, and how does he get out of jail all the time... that just dum.what the hell is monster island, what they just appear there...give me a reason for all these dum...stuff.CHEMICAL X... IF THE KIDS IN THAT ONE EPISODE THEY GET SUPER POWERS FROM CHEMICAL X ISN'T THERE A SIDE-EFFECT TO USING THE STUFF BESIDE BECOMEING LOYAL, I MEAN IF CHEMICAL X WERE REAL THE GOVERMENT WOULD BE USING IT, NOT NO HOME LAB PROFESSOR. I SUGGEST YOU PEOPLE LOOK IN TO THIS AND NOW!!!!"
4,actually 4 1/2,"I thought this book was much better than the last few book as far as the character feeling in chraracter. Maybe Mrs. braun was just in a slump. There isn't much mystery to this one. Unfortunately the killer is pretty obivious from the get go and Mrs. Braun never even puts suspicion on anyone else. This would have lost the book 2 stars in my review, but a pleasant twist at the end added one star back. Also, with the return of Celia Robinson, my favorite Moose County resident next to Qwill and the Kitties, I was able to add the 1/2 star. It could have been a perfect five it Polly had decided to move away, but I have resigned myself to the fact that that is never gonna happen. I really enjoyed this book and I am sure most Cat Who fans will too."
1,Pathetic,"I got this book thinking it was a mystery. The only mystery was how the author has gotten 25 books published! It seems like a Yuppie's dream come true - a detailed account of everything the protagonist eats in snooty restaurants.Except for a few minimal attempts at hinting that something is amiss, there is no plot that I can find (another mystery!). The crimes are basically described and solved by someone else in the last forty pages of the book.Don't waste your money!"
3,not one her best books.,was a little diapponted in this book. it reminded me of so much of her others. its a nice light book but it didn't take long to read.
3,The Cat Who Always Carries a Tape Recorder,"LJB's love of the pocket tape recorder just cracks me up. Quill has long been whipping his recorder out right and left (to capture stories for Long and Short Tales of course). Now the leading lady in the latest Cat Who novel is getting in on the recording action, because as an important personage, her longtime advisor insists upon it. Say what? When was the last time you saw a limo pull in the Radio Shack parking lot, and a uniformed valet hop out and order up a pocket tape recorder for The Boss? It does make things especially convenient though, when murders are caught on tape, then left helpfully behind."
1,Disappointed in Colorado,"I really enjoyed the early ""The Cat Who..."" books. They involved the characters in the plot, they had more than ""Hi, how are you"" conversations and were more than cardboard cutouts. As a fledgling mystery writer it is very disheartening to see such ""slock"" sold to the public. If this is a ghost writer maybe I should apply for the job. I know I could write a better mystery. ""The Cat Who.."" books are thin anyway, but this book was made up of excerpts from Qwill's book which had little to do with the so called murder mystery plot. Believe me I will never spend hard earned money for another in the series. I won't even let it take up room on my library shelf. This book goes to the used book store in trade for something worth reading."
2,The rumor of a ghost writer will persist with this one!,"I'm afraid the ""Cat Who..."" series is on a downhill slide. Although a quick read, this 25th title was flat & unmysterious. We know the villain practically from the get-go, and the story lacks the usual subtle clues building up to the ultimate solving of the crime. Come to think of it, there wasn't even much of a story! Major events like the fund-raiser are given short shrift, & important details such as Polly's leaving the library are glossed over. The characters, whom we know so well from the previous books, are one-dimensional. For that matter, where ARE they all? Chief Brodie barely makes an appearance, & then only as a bagpiper, and his classy daughter, Fran, has suddenly become a snobby lush we don't recognize. This can no longer be considered a mystery series which leads me to ask ""Who wrote this book?"""
2,bland at best,"While I love the early ""Cat Who"" books, I'm not sure why I continue to read the series. In the past few books, the mysteries have been transparent and character development slow. This is no exception. Nothing really happens. The new characters aren't interesting or personable enough to make an impact on Pickax or the reader. There's no real mystery--a couple of yowls from Koko and a dead body thrown in at the end. The liberal use of exclamation points in the prose doesn't make up for the lack of action in the story. If you need a Qwill fix, borrow this one from the library. Better yet, go back and read one of the first ten books in the series."
3,Ready to put it to rest,"After 25 years of reading ""The Cat Who"" books, I'm ready to put Qwill out to pasture. While this book has a much better plot than the other latest 3 or 4, the writer or ghostwriter, seems to have just gotten tired and leaves out the details or entire convesations that made the early books such treasures. For instance, Koko does his death cry only once out of 3 deaths; his death cry signals the first murder but then apparently Koko sleeps through the last, most important two deaths. This book has sparks of the old Lilian and sets up some interesting things that could happen in the next book, but in response to her asking whether or not to make it 26 mysteries, ""No"". I'll miss Qwill but I want to remember him as he was and not the shadow he and Koko are becoming."
5,The Cat Who Brought Down The House,"I absolutely enjoyed this book. This series is a delight, the stories are a pleasant visit to a charming community. These books always end far to soon, I cannot put them down."
1,Stupid,"This is a sickingly incipid ""book,"" a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print."
2,The Cat who brought down the House,"Having been a fan of Lillian Jackson Braun for as long as the ""Cat Who"" series have been out, I am disappointed with this latest book. The whole book seems to be about accumulating material for Qwilleran's Short and Long Tails. Koko and Yum Yum no longer play important roles and have been banished to acting like cats instead of the intelligent cat Koko used to be. I am beginning to wonder if someone other than Lillian Jackson Braun is writing these books. Please, more Koko, less Qwilleran and Polly."
3,The house fell flat,"The latest book in the Cat Who... series left me flat. It was definitely not up to the standard of the other books in the series. There was very little mystery in the whole thing- the reader knows who done it, the cat knows who done it, even Mr. Q knows who done it, but is made to stumble (or rather eat) his way through the book as if there is a mystery to solve. I kept hoping for something interesting to happen, but nothing ever did. A snoozer."
2,Sweet but dull,"If you are looking for a mystery this is not the book you want to read. This is more of a soothing story to put one in a comatose state of sorts. In a weird way it was relaxing to read but there is not much plot, no action, no investigation as such and, 2 days after you read it, Koko's persuits will fade from your memory. Go back to the older books -- they are much more lively."
2,An era has ended,"While I deeply respect Ms. Braun and have so greatly enjoyed the wonderful characters she brought to life in the Cat Who series, it now seems painfully obvious that she now has little if anything to do with the actual story developments in the newest entries in this series. And what is worse is that apparently no editors are available to clean up the writing, punctuation, and grammar in what is being published. Even when past plot lines were easily deciphered, the dialog among the many characters and the antics of Koko and Yum Yum were more than sufficient to make the read very enjoyable. Alas that is not true in this entry and the rapid attempt to close out the last chapter is the most disappointing of all. Perhaps it is time to allow the era of entertaining mysteries in Moose County to end and not drag the memory down with inferior editions."
4,"Still fun, but not really a mystery.","If you love Qwill and Pickax, it's a wonderfully fun story, but not much of a mystery."
2,No mystery to this mystery,"Same lovable characters. But poor story line. No twist in the plot, no long list of possible bad guys. You know from the beginning ""who done it"". The only mystery to this book is what happened to the author? Bring back the success of the original cat who stories."
4,good quality,"Good quality universal cover, also a little height to it for a fuller pan. If it could clean itself, I would give it five stars."
5,Good product,"A very well-made product. I've had it for about six months; it has a nice old-fashioned heft to it, and it was cheaper than I could have bought locally. No complaints."
5,Three Godfathers,I have a collection of 75 of John Wayne's movies. This is one of his best & perhaps because it was directed by John Ford. It is hard to find this movie. It is the story of 3 bank robbers who while being harried by the law find a woman having a baby. As she is dying in childbirth she makes these scoundrels promise to be the baby's godfathers. John Wayne's character ends up as the only survivor as the godfathers try to get the baby safely across the desert.
3,too brief for too big,"Edwards tryed to cover the arena size dimension of (not just male homosexuality) but masculinity and feminism to boot- in a micro court of 172 pages! the paragraphs are stuffy, the chapters are inconsistent. keep looking."
1,choking hazard,"This toy is only about 4 inches tall total, and the stacking pieces do not stay together if you even blow on them! The top red piece is only about 1 inch in diameter with makes it a choking hazard for small children. I fail to see how this can pass safety checks in the USA.Horrible purchase!!!"
2,paint rubbed off,"I was shocked when we recieved this toy. Everyone gives it great reviews; however, as the pieces rub together the paint was rubbed down- NOT flaking- but it gave the toy the appearance of being used. For $20, I expect a brand new looking toy. I haven't decided after returning this if we will reorder."
5,Great book,"A very telling tale of the cruel treatment of the Lakota by the American Government. Sitting Bull's story is truly inspirational, and it really makes you wonder what America would've really been like if Native Americans and the government could've coexisted. The injustices in this book speak volumes, and has really sparked a strong interest in Native American history.Great book, I strongly recommend it."

4,flair hogan there last one on one classic,this is a very good pay per view. The wall chokes slams crowbar of a 20 foot scafoled to the floor. Great hardcore tittle match with Brian Nobs beating all three members of three count. The falls count any where match between fit finly and vampiro ruled. The bull rope match with rodes and funk was pretty good. lumber jackmatch was alright. Sid and jarret in a good match. Flair and hogan in war with Hogan coming out on top. I would give this tape a 5/5 but there was about 2 weak matches which hurt this pay per view.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Between Russo and the New Blood, the WCW has turned into a real soap opera! I thought the nwo was stupid but they have gone far beyond that now! They have also edited out even the mildest of language from the video making it a blip....blip....blip.... The announcers do not even bother to cover the match anymore. They are too busy following the story line in the script written for them. Whatever happened to wrestling matches anyway? On top of all of this they have the nerve to charge nearly twice as much as the WWF for their videos, never really understood this one????Should they ever decide to dump Russo and get back to reality I may try WCW again. I am afraid of the next story line as it would probably be even worse than this one. This video does not deserve the 1 star I gave it but you cannot rate it a ""0""."
4,THE LAST WCW PPV,"This was really the last WCW PPV before Ted Turner finally had enough and sold WCW to business enemy Vince McMahon. Up to this point of time in 2000, WCW had had much better wrestlers and storylines than the WWE. Maybe thats why they grumbled; too many great wrestlers, too many matches and wrestlers that had control over their storylines like Hogan and Bret Hart. Some miss the ""sport"" factor that WCW had, nowadays the WWE is more ""entertainment"" with famous celebrities, long climaxing matches and heaps of advertising."
4,Quick and tasty,You can make these in the microwave and they still taste good... though maybe a little salty
4,A Classic western!,"When Dave Cameron bought the Running W he did not realize the deeds to his ranch included the rights to a range war. But trouble came fast. For months the land-hungry Rock Chair outfit had been moving in on small ranchers, and now, with the firing of a neighboring rancher's barn, tempers exploded. Reluctantly, Dave buckled on his guns and set out to make a lone-hand play against the lawless knowing his own ranch and the woman he loved were at stake, and that if he failed the whole range would become a bloody battleground."
5,In a word .... fabulous,"For a first time novellist, Donna has it down pat. This was referred to me by a friend, and as a compulsive devourer of books I took it with good grace. I read it while holidaying in South East Asia and loved every bit, as did my husband. You will not be disappointed"
5,"Beautiful, exciting, haunting - it will stay with you.","I began to read this book about 5 years ago and could not get past page 50. I picked it up again, on a whim, and could not put it down. Tartt does what no other mystery author I have read does - she examines not just the bloody, gory aspects of murder but the psychological ramifications of the act, the crumbling foundation of ego and the uncontrollable bonds of friendship. It is beautifully written, with well-drawn charaters and a lovely setting."
5,Ditto Head,"I know that I am saying the same thing as most people, when will Ms. Tartt write another! I've just finished reading it for the third time in about six years. It gets better with each read. The characters are so well developed, it leaves you wanting to know more."
4,Very good entertainment.,"This book has flaws but they're not nearly as significant as the reviews would have you believe. This book was overhyped and the author overpaid, particularly because there are questions about how much of it she even wrote. The critics were justifiably sick of hearing about it before it was published and their annoyance affected the reviews more than it probably should have. The Secret History drops too many allusions and foreign language phrases and doesn't wait for appropriate opportunities to lay them on. The characters are snotty and shallow. The story is implausible. The author comes off as very proud of how smart she (or he)has decided she is. None of this means it's not a very entertaining book worthy of being about as long as it is (rare these days) and a brilliant solution for a long plane ride with layovers. Get yourself into a slightly forgiving mood and don't miss this chance."
5,A Real Page-Turner,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. It was amazing how Tartt could reveal the turning point before the story began and still keep my interest because I wanted to find out how. I gave this book to my male friend for his 20th birthday and he read it in less than 24 hours (which is saying quite a bit considering he doesn't like to read and he had a paper due the next day on an unrelated subject). This book is also very well-written. I've also read The Little Friend, which is good, but this is better."
4,"Emotioanl, dramatic novel of friendship, love and murder","An intriguing first novel about a group of college friends whose love of Greek classicism (and a greatteacher) leads to murder. While many critics have found this book pretentious, I found the charactersinteresting and well drawn. In fact, the charcters are the most interesting part of the book. The murderthat occurs and what leads up to it is less interesting than getting inside these characters heads. Readthis for a well-written look at five people and a look inside their heads as they go through a terrible yearin college. If you're looking for a good mystery however, look elsewhere. This is a character study."
5,Wouldn't change a thing,"I first heard about this novel from an obscure reference on the dust jacket of Alex Garland's ""The Beach"". I decided to check it out, and found myself continually and consistantly impressed by both the story AND the writing. Tartt displays her talent without flaunting it.Going by the numbers, the novel is quite long, but I hung on every word and was even disappointed when I turned onto the last page. I was actually sad that the story had come to an end. I hear that a movie is in the works. As long as the filmmakers stick to the text, they will have a surefire success on their hands."
5,This is an unforgettable story!,"I choose my books carefully -- my general rule is not to read something I don't think will be in print five years from now! ""The Secret History"" is a book I've recommended for years without hesitation. I own two copies: one to keep and one to lend to those I think will appreciate this beautifully written, impressive novel. The writing is muscular, graceful, very assured. The characters are compelling, and the story is riveting. I recommend it without reservation. Once you begin, be ready to turn down invitations so you can stay home to read! Those who think this is nothing more than a murder mystery are missing the point: this book is in a category by itself."
2,who cares?,"I spent several nights reading this novel, which has been touted as being brilliant...... And now that I've finished it, I consider those nights wasted. Who cares about any of these characters? They are the epitome of spoiled college kids who spend most of their time drinking and using drugs and the rest of their time thinking how intelligent they are. The main character hates his parents, hates his hometown, hates everything about his life until he gets to college and then he finds a group of people he can spar with intellectually. In the end they are all insane or dead and Richard lives on, still hating everything. The references to classical lit were great, if a little too, too....."
2,Insufferable bores,"I kept waiting for a real plot to emerge. Spoiled, self involved, drunken college kids accidentally kill someone and then spend the next 300 pages simpering about being found out. I don't care how smart they're supposed to be, I found them all to be insufferable bores."
3,Much ado about nothing,"This is a silly, pretentious book about characters for whom you have no sympathy. It is the typical product of creative writing classes with high level language about nothing worthy of the language. The author needs to get some soul into her writing. The narrator's voice is strangely dead and decidedly not masculine. Write about what you know. Perhaps Ms Tartt should follow Arthur Rimbaud's advice: whatis needed is a derangement of the senses. This is the literary version of a coffee table art book. Attractive but without fire. Perhaps your time could have been spent more profitably reading something else. Three stars instead of less because it is a first novel, the author tried hard, and hopefully she will get the stick out from where it is and write something with sincerity instead of self-indulgence."
2,"A slow, tedious read","A friend recommended this book. I do not know why. My opinion: I found it to be a slow, tedious read, mainly because it contains many detailed descriptions about people, settings and situations irrelevant to the story - what I consider ""filler"" and a waste of the reader's time. I think the book could have been much shorter. Furthermore, the characters and plot were never believable. A college student helps new friends hide a murder with which he had no involvement, and then helps those friends commit another murder to help ensure the first murder - again, one in which he had no involvement - is not revealed. The author uses her characters to display her knowledge of language and literature. I guess she had to use it for something.No, I've never written a book and I probably never will. And, yes, it's easy to criticize someone else's work. Still, I did not enjoy reading this story."
4,Alot of fun and I felt like I was there.,"This book really took me in. I felt like I was the new student on campus and I was put in all the situations going on in the book...that is a sign of a fun, entertaining book for me! It's not a super great book so I'm not going to give it 5 stars but it had most everything I was looking for in it and kept me engaged, thinking and wondering what was going to happen next.All in all a fun read and one I will likely read again."
2,Disappointed,"While this book at first seemed to have promise, I was increasingly disappointed and felt, near the end, that I had to finish it because I already had invested considerable time, not because I was enjoying it. In the end you really don't care for any of the characters and some even seem unnatural as do some of the situations."
2,Disappointing...,"I kept waiting for this book to get better. Though it is easy-to-read, it never did get better, not in all the 524 pages. I spent a majority of the book waiting to find out why the murder happened. And then the reason, when we finally got to it, was unbelievable. I get tired of authors trying to get us to sympathize with immoral behavior. And to expect us to believe that out of a group of such educated kids no one would do ""the right thing"" is tiresome. These were college kids who got sauced and pilled up hoping for some fantastic experience and then killed someone. Studying the Classics certainly didn't enhance their moral reasoning. There were interesting tidbits (disconnection from families, sibling incestual relationahips) which could have been explored to help us understand the characters more, but I guess she just couldn't find the space in this tome. When I finished this book, my last reaction was ""Huh? That's it? Well, I'm glad this is over."""
2,Really not that good,"Boy, was it hard labor getting through this book. First off, there is a lot of fluff in the book. Nothing seems to happen for the most part. To be honest, I really don't often read books of this ilk. However, I had thought that this would be a good page-turner, but it wasn't. After about six pages of reading I would stare down at my fingernails to see if they needed trimming or stare aimlessly out the window.Secondly, I really just didn't like the characters in the book. They all seemed to be just pompous ingrates who thought they were a lot smarter than they were. If I saw them at a party I would be forced to throttle each and ever one. In the end, there just seemed to be nothing redeeming about those people.All in all, pretty crummy."
2,Oh grow up!,"I was more than a little annoyed with this book. I have spent a lot of time on campuses and among academics and Donna Tartt confirms what I've come to believe about that environment: it's unhealthy, ingrown, and it breeds narcicissism like nobody's business. The main character is about as unsympathetic as they come, rejecting parents notwithstanding (maybe they had their reasons now that I've gotten to know him.) The characters that flutter around him are even less appealing. I wanted to reach into the pages of the book and snap my fingers in their pinched little faces. ""Wake up!"" I would have said. ""You are not the center of the universe."" I've read other books by Tartt and found them to be engaging and meaningful. This one asks the reader to bear with the characters' self-obsession for hundreds of pages. I quit about two-thirds of them."
2,One of the most over-rated books ever,"Not suspenseful, not involving, and definitely not interesting. Basically, not any of the million things that its slobbering fans describe it as."
2,An amateur effort,"I read this book because I had enjoyed her second book, ""Little Friend,"" despite its clumsy ending. I found this book to be amateurish, e.g., using an ""Epilogue"" at the end of the book to wrap up story lines involving minor characters...even though these characters were unnecessary to resolution of the main plot. Her characterizations were more like caricatures, describing (endlessly) the smoking and drinking habits of her characters, giving the rich protagonists excessively foppish ways. Annoyingly, there wasn't a single character I actually LIKED. All were venal, shallow, nitwits with no moral character whatsoever. Not even flickers of conscience for some very bad conduct. Finally, the plot was ludicrous in that (no spoilers here) the police were incapable of discovering who committed the crimes, even though there were clues everywhere. Like, ""Little Friend,"" there is a simplistic ending that does not coincide with the internal logic of the story."
4,"Great beginning, great story, weak ending.","This book begins like a question already anwsered, which could be a very bad idea. Yet the reader's interest is held by the narrator's rationalization and explanation for why he and this intellectual group of new friends kill one of their own. A literary risk that is truely interesting. However, the story ends about 10 pages before the book ends. The wrap up of what happens the to the characters, even some insignificant characters, after graduation is unnecessary and boring. Nonetheless, The Secret History is still worth the 500 page read."
2,First book I never finished,"This book was the first that once I started it I failed to finish reading it. The plot intrigued me at first. What could have been a good book made up of interesting characters and unpredictable plot twists, became a chore to read because the author was too verbose. At first her description of everything made for an interesting and highly developed story. However, when she continually described the most mundane acts in no less than ten lines a piece I was no longer interested. I found myself trying to skip the verbiage and find the meat of the book. In the end I put the book down and never returned."
4,"Excellent, stimulating book!",Fascinating and a creative morality tale on every level! Great analysis of the light and dark present in every human being. Claire Stanard
5,Best book I've read,Without going into detail about the story (lots of others have done that already) I'd like to just comment on the perfection of this book. Its one of the few that I've read and wished it would not end. Donna Tartt keeps the story going and going. I am very impressed with her writing style and I can't wait to read The Little Friend. If I could give this book 10 stars I would do it in a heartbeat. This book is satisfying to the end. Thank you Donna Tartt....Give us another one!
1,A complete waste of time,"Pretentious and boring, the author seems to be trying to impress the reader with her pseudo-intellectual nonsense. Didn't care about the characters and was bored by the plot. A great book for intellectuasl wannnabees."
1,Boring + Pretentious = Waste of Time!,"This book was loathesome. I haven't hated characters this much since suffering through a Whit Stillman movie. I was begging and pleading for some calamity to befall the entire cast. Hey Donna, did they teach you how to write an ending in Creative Writing 101?"
1,"author's crime, readers' punishment","I was attracted to Donna Tartt's novel ""The Secret History"" by the prologue's punchline: ""This is the only story I will ever be able to tell."" Now I wish that were strictly true.Ms. Tartt attempted to write a modern version of Dostoevsky's classic in the style of Richard Farina. It's an interesting premise that fails entirely because she can't construct a vaguely convincing facimile of the male persona.The major characters (six stupid and corrupt rich-kids and their equally shallow professor) are uniformly effeminate and unimaginative. They are contrasted with various stereotyped fools and establishment stooges. If you stick with the book, you will find yourself hoping for a proper punishment for each of the characters. But no, they all achieve a proper post-modern salvation in the warm afterglow of their burned out brain cells."
1,too long and boring,"This book is way too long. It just drags on and on and on about uninteresting annoying characters. The narrator, Richard, is a dork. How is it that he comes off as such a dork and yet makes friends with this so-called elitist group? Throughout the book Richard brings up little tid bits that are unnecessary to the storyline. He gives about a paragraph of insight but then just drops it and there is no relation to the story. So what is the ""secret"" of this book? There is none. In the opening pages we find out a murder has occurred and the rest is just boring details."
2,"Erudite, stylistic, but in the end not credible and boring.","Agree with earlier reviews that said characters are one-dimensional and 'cartoon-y'. No emotional investment created in the narrator. I'm generally dubious of female authors writing male main characters and vice versa, and the reason for that is born out here - the main character comes off, if not feminine, a bit asexual, further damaging his believability. Too much style, not enough substance."
3,Could be stronger...,"I think the book has good elements to tell us a good story, however it loses its virtual qualitative narrative in somewhat emptiness dialogues. Its characters go no longer, in a VICIOUS CIRCLE. Neverthless, the idea is preety good."
2,Reasonably well-crafted juvenilia,"This book must be placed in the bin reserved for the highly over-rated. The writing itself is well done, especially at the beginning, but the characters are so shallow and repulsive that one loses interest by the end of the first half. The dominant theme of mannered pretension becomes tiresome very quickly, and the plot itself unravels a bit toward the end. This is the kind of story written by a somewhat precocious child, which perhaps is what Tartt was when she wrote it. In the last couple pages there is a horrific plot twist of the kind which truly marks the immature writer. I won't tell what it is, but the event underlines the aptness of labeling this as juvenilia."
4,"Disturbing, enjoyable, thought provoking, but not a classic","A Brief Review: I gave this book four stars, rather than three, because it affected me; although I don't think it is an overly amazing book, I really liked it. There are far too many bad books out there, and for the characters, scenes, and ""bigger questions"" to linger in my mind days after finishing the book, it deserves something above average. I don't think this book will be a classic, there are parts that are unrealistic, and the writing is not over-the-top amazing. This said, I enjoyed the writing, found the book very readable, became attached to and involved with the characters, and found that the book prodded me to ask questions of myself. The book is a good read, and will suffice for that if that is what you are looking for, but it also goes beyond a good read into the realm of a well-written book that raises important questions about life and death, friendships, relationships, and love."
2,"Good character development, poor structure","This book is ultimately disappointing due to the author's failure to maintain dramatic tension. Tartt gives away the main climax in the Preface. The reader immediately knows what will happen, and knows before long why it happens, then has to watch it slowly unfold. A later dramatic moment is unsuprising despite being (it seemed to me) incongruous with the character, and it comes largely out of the blue - nothing leads up to or follows from it.Some other reviewers' comments that I agree with: easily 200 pages overlength, feels like the 1950's, while it purports to be in the 1980's (I think), and the ease with which the students slip into their murderous behavior is simply not believable. The characters are quirky enough to be interesting, yet still believable and sympathetic, but the plot line is not credible."
5,"My favorite book, bar none","I would be suprised if I have read this book, in its entirety, less than 50 times."
4,Movie in the Works?,"I read this book a few years ago and am going to re-read it soon. My friend, from whom I borrowed the book, and I are shocked and amazed that it has not yet been optioned for a motion picture. Such a film would be an excellent vehicle for the latest Brat Pack (Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Robert Sean Leonard, Moira Kelly, et.al.). I can't wait for another book by Donna Tartt and I'm still watching those ""Coming Attractions"" at the theater!"
5,"Eerie, suspenseful, and wonderfully written","I read Donna Tartt's ""Little Friend"" three years ago and was spellbound; last week I came across a mention of The Secret History and wondered why I never read it.The Secret History is a modern twist on the gothic.Tartt masterfully weaves together idyllic imagery with just enough foreshadow and haunt to keep the reader gripped at all times. I was taken a little aback when I first picked up the book- it's 560 pp in paperback!- but I could barely put it down.The story does not unfold so much as it's like a monsoon... just when you think you have a grasp on the characters and the story, new details emerge, with vague hints that make you wonder why you never noticed it before. Other reviewers complain about this style, but I find it's precisely the point. The reader, like the narrator, finds herself exposed to more mystery and complexities than seemed possible."
5,A History of Secrets,"I was so surprised to see that the first review of this excellent book was that terrible Kirkus one that I just had to write my own review as a rebuttal. On the contrary, The Secret History is a very rich, paradoxical, and incisive book that most intelligent people should enjoy. Tartt's style is very interesting- lyrical, chilling, and scholarly; yet also hysterically funny in places you least expect it. The storyline, extremely unpredictable and constantly surprising, is filled with sly symbolism and clever foreshadowing. It is a very page-turning, satisfying, challenging read which I highly recommend."
2,Didn't Live Up To The Hype,"I picked up this book with great expectations after all the glowing reviews and personal recs from many of my friends. I do not know if I expected too much, or if this book is simply not what it is advertised to be. The premise I found fascinating, and yet I feel that Donna Tartt did not do as much with this novel as she could have. She relied too much on detailing the immoral lifestyles the core characters led, and shied away from delving more deeply into a psychological analysis of how each of the main characters changed after Bunny's murder. Parts were also somewhat unrealistic, as I did not buy how easily Richard Papen was manipulated by Henry et al, and the ridiculous amount of alcohol and drugs that the students consumed would have made it difficult to ever think straight, much less thrive in their studies. Overall it was mildly entertaining, but I found myself struggling to finish the last third of the book."
1,Pretentious tripe. Good for kindling though.,"It's a while since I read this book but the disappointment stays with me still.I read Tana French's 'The Likeness' and, putting ridiculous plot aside, quite enjoyed it. Some reviewers said it was a direct copy of The Secret History and that this was much the better novel.I did at least like some of the characters in The Likeness; to me, the first rule of writing a novel is MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS LIKEABLE. I detested all of them in The Secret History. I didn't care that one of them was murdered; I hated him as well. I hated the professor and I hated the references to Greek; it didn't make it more high-brow, just more boring. I have never felt so much like I wasted a day of my life than when I'd finished this. I thought it would be beautiful but it was b******s.Her other novel was b******s too. I didn't even finish that one. Please, read 'The Likeness' is you are into strange, antisocial groups of students; it does at least chug along at a fair pace."
3,Still Not Finished... Groan!,"Now maybe this book isn't geared for light bedtime readers who can only get through 10 pages a night, because I am barely half way through after many nights of reading. I get the gist of this book, the writing style is enjoyable, the characters quirky and eerily calm for murderers. I agree with the criticism that the timeframe for this book is lost somewhere. Did it take place in the 60's, 70's or 80's? There are hippies and at one point the characters are watching ""Petticoat Junction"". Is that on eternal cable or regular TV? I am enjoying plugging away at this book, but maybe I'd be much happier reading something else. This is a used paperback, so the only investment is my time. I tried reading Tartt's ""The Little Friend"" and couldn't make it through and neither could several friends of mine. Maybe Ms. Tartt would be best served by taking a course in brevity...."
2,Bit pompous,"A friend who usually makes excellent referrals suggested this book to me. I found that while the writer was able to create some suspense and had a good plot, the writing was stuffy and pompous. The characters were all unrealistic and one-dimensional -- they were very sterotypical ""wealthy elitists"" with no depth of character or intrigue. References to culture were confusing, often leading one to believe that the story was set in the late 60's, then refering to CDs. After a while, the story seemed to ramble on, going nowhere for far too long. At the end, I was left with a feeling of ""Oh, what was the fuss about?"""
4,Enjoyable and FUN but unresolved...,I enjoyed this book very much....it had a great feel to it...i loved the story....there are some parts of it left unexplained....espcially the KEY TURNING point in the story isnt even disccussed thoroughly....anyways its a simple story....nothing extraordinary here...but still its the writing tht makes it more than wht it really is....Recommended!!!
4,Well-written character study of college kids & murder,"An intriguing first novel about a group of college friends whose love of Greek classicism (and a great teacher) leads to murder.While many critics have found this book pretentious, I found the characters interesting and well drawn. In fact, the charcters are the most interesting part of the book. The murder that occurs and what leads up to it is less interesting than getting inside these characters heads.Read this for a well-written look at five people and a look inside their heads as they go through a terrible year in college.If you're looking for a good mystery however, look elsewhere. This is a character study."
3,Not bad. Not great. Just Good.,"If you can manage to overlook the pretentious, pseudo-intellectual nature of this book and disregard the stereotypical stock characters it is a very entertaining novel. When I first began reading it I could not help but groan at the ridiculously over-the-top personalities and the stilted dialogue. After making a concious effort to just read and enjoy I found myself wrapped up in the story and titillated by the supremely phony world that these ""collegiate"" characters inhabit. I could not put it down. It stuck with me. It has been weeks since I read it and here I am reveiwing it on Wednesday at midnight. Not bad. Not great. Just good."
2,Hell burped up a book,"I just read 579 pages of this aimless prose. Where do I go to get my time back?Peopled by six amoral, half-drunk fools, this trendy cocktail tells of two incoherent murders (motivated by what again?) and the circumstances surrounding them. No feeling, no pace, little dramatic tension, this is modern fiction at its self-conscious, flaccid worst. So far from real life it isn't funny."
1,POMPOUS JUNK,"Need I say more.This is not even worth 1 star, but I could not find a -10!!.....And where did this author(??)do her research? There is so much mis-information pertaining to literature, history etc...it's laughable."
1,just couldn't do it,"As an avid book reader, I was disappointed in myself that I couldn't even see this book to the end. This is the first book that I've ever thrown away because I just couldn't stand the fact that it was taking up space.Please don't waste your money on this book. Life it too short, move onto another one you'll like better."
1,Rubbish book-don't buy it!,"I just bought ""The secret history"" to read on holiday.It must be the worst bookI have EVER read.Sooo disappointing!Do I care about the characters? NO! Does anything happen in the 630 pages? NO!Don't waste your money...read a telephone directory instead."
1,Not worth the money.,"This book is absolutely horrible. Donna Tartt is so blanantly obvious in all of her literary techniques that one can not help but feel insulted in her obviously low opinion of all of society. Perhaps this is just her writing style; however, it is still present and extremely annoying, taking away from the rest of the book. I wish that I could give this book no stars at all because, essentially there is no enthralling plot whatsoever. The main characters drink, sleep, and drink some more and then they murder somebody. I recieved this book for free and I still feel ripped-off. If you truly want to read this book, I would suggest checking a copy out from the library first."
5,a modern classic,"The Secret History is in every sense of the term - a Classic. A truely satisfying reading experience, it is set in a modern world that we can all relate to, and yet there is an overall sense of something just beyond our grasp. If you're looking for a captivating page turner with substance, this is the perfect read."
2,Not recommended. Book dragged.,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I know it is supposed to be a similar style as Carol Goodman's books, but it defiantly is not. The story dragged until the point I finally gave up reading it. As a person who reads several books a week, this book took me almost 2 months to get through and I never finished. I would not recommend this book."
1,Boooooring,"After reading the delightful ""The Little Friend,"" I couldn't wait to start this one. The book is a mish mash of drunken party scenes and hangovers. The characters are stiff and speak in ways peculiar for college students---how many times have you heard someone say, ""goodness?"" The descriptive scenes are full on dishes crashing in the cafeteria, which tires after a while. There's a lot of talking and very little action, with people reacting strangely to situations. When have you ever heard of someone being ""stunned"" when hearing that a friend was seen standing in front of a bank? Save your money!!!!"
2,Unlikeable Characters,"I did not care for this book, because I did not care what happened to the characters. Richard Papen was one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read about it and considering he is the story teller, you should be able to identify with him on some level. Wonderful sentences and structure, but I just plain ol' didn't care about any of it."
5,The Heart of the History,"What to say about this book..I've started this review more than five times. It's an elusive thing. Tartt can create images like the most detailed, beautiful Carleton Watkins photograph you've ever seen...convincing dialogue as well. The test is to bundle all these images into a cohesive story that hangs together. Along the way I had my doubts, but in the end it worked. The book has stayed with me and I keep asking myself questions about duty and character and people/things appearing one way, but being another. These are worth continuing to ponder."
4,Better with age,"Books, experience, love affairs... Like fine wine, the true value of a book is in the aftertaste, the impession it leaves for you to mull over, the sense of summers past and summers to come. This book does not dissapoint, it comes at you with a lot of action, interesting characters and a cunning plotline. I enjoyed it immensely, but two thirds of the way through I began to duck and cover waiting for the ending. A bit like Beethovens ninth, you wonder just how it can all be brought together at the end. I'm happy to say there's a nice concluding enigmatic note. Read with confidence dear reader! The aftertase of this book has lingered on my palate to the extent that I am considering going back for a second read."
3,Far Too Long!,"Although this book is beautifully written and the author obviously has a marvellous grasp of the English language, I found this book far too long and drawn out. I got half way through and found to my surprise that everything (and by everything I mean the two murders) had happened and I was left thinking 'what else is she going to write about'. I unfortunately also predicted the ending but nevertheless I had to read until I'd finished it as I don't like to give up on a book. Not bad but not the best book I've ever read."
2,Machines Making Machines,"The main flaw I found in this novel is that I found the protagonist, Richard, to be unconvincing. There is something odd with the way Tartt chose to make him a man, his voice is more the voice of the author's and it doesn't quite succeed.Novelists such as Donna Tartt, like many others, have a very common problem. Yes, they are well-educated, well-read, and intelligent, but they lack true grit. Perhaps it is a lack of life experience and because they gain much inspiration from other literature i.e. second-hand knowledge. This gives an air of falsehood to the work and never really hits on an instinctive, gut level.This novel will appeal to those similar to Tartt and be the book ""I wish I wrote"" since it shows off so much education and knowledge. But this novel ultimately comes across as a potboiler, despite all its literary pretensions."
4,Donna Tartt illustrates the complexities of college life,"Donna Tartt vividly captures the dynamics of college life in her debut novel. Having attended a small liberal arts college (though in New York City) I could identify with the way the small group of students revered Julian. I understood why they grasped onto each other in an almost incestuous way, finally feeling a common thread after the vacuous teenage years. Yet I was disturbed with their inability to draw the line at some point and take control of their own actions, independent of one another. And though I enjoyed the book, there was not one character I came to like or respect. I felt however, that Donna Tartt illustrated life in a small New England college beautifully and poetically."
5,Unforgettable!,"This book was amazing. It reminded me a lot of the Dead Poet's Society, but even better. I had read ""The Little Friend"" first and wanted more by this author and picked up this book. It's one of those books that stays with you for weeks or months after you are done reading it. I loved this book and can't wait until Ms. Tartt writes another one. Although I suspect I will be waiting a long time because her second book didn't come out until 10 years after the first."
3,Appealing combination of high and low...,"The Secret History is a novel about the kind of people who still see themselves,in their early twenties, as highly romantic, mysterious individuals. They area secrective group of intellectually gifted students, taking a walk on their ownwild sides. What makes the book engaging is that the author buys wholly into themystique of her characters; her zealous belief in the tragic stature of thesepeople and events almost convinces the reader, as well. But in proslytizingfor her faith, Tartt pushes the novel too close to pretentiousnessand, ultimately, melodrama. Of course, that's what makes it sucha page turner."
4,"Pretentious, but interesting","This is a chilling story about murder, supposed friendship and how small groups of people can become cultish under certain influences.The story does drag at times as it follows some of the most pretentious college students ever created in fiction. The group is extremely bright, but not as bright as they think they are. The reader's awareness of the group's intellect and flaws follows the same arc as that of the narrator who realizes too late that maybe following the group wasn't such a good idea after all.Despite being more than 500 pages, not a single one of those pages contains a character you'd want to know personally. I'm not a proponent of authors only writing about likable people by any means, but it can be a challenge to read 500 pages straight about people who vary from despicable to the bad side of neutral."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,Definately one of my favorite novels. Not only was I sad to finish this but I've not found anything I like as well since I read this book. I'd welcome email suggestions from anyone who might offer reading recommendations for simular reads. I'd sure enjoy another Donna Tartt novel.
5,This book has stuck with me,"i read this book one weekend when it first came out. i had just returned from an extended trip to Guatemala and was sick with the flu. It was a wet, cold rainy LA weekend - i had a fire going, layed down on the sofa and got lost in this book. I have referred it to a number of people who i knew would just get it like i did. it wasn't anything in particular it's just a great read. i can tell you every detail of my experience while reading it for the first time - from the music i had playing to the food i ate. i think about this alot. i read widely with diversity - this was a find and it remains very close to me. Where is Donna Tartts next effort?"
4,Wonderfully written! I don't remember ever putting it down.,"If you are not literate in Greek there may be a few trouble reading spots, but when you get passed that, it is a wonderful read. The characters are developed nicely and the story line is well thought out. I would definetly reccomend this book to a in coming college students or anyone else who wants to see how good books are written."
4,"An erudite, ironic, stylish debut novel without much soul","About three-quarters of the way through The Secret History, I was dazzled--16 years after it was written, this is still such a mature, complete novel, written in careful, lovingly detailed prose, about the relationship of character and aesthetics to murder and death.Then, in the last 100 pages, my reservations about the book from its first 100 pages resurfaced: Tartt's baroque and wooden characters and dialogue and bleak and humorless vision of humanity (although this stretch of the book is also paradoxically peppered with most of the book's laugh-out-loud deadpan moments) make (to use a mixed-metaphor I read online once) ""awfully weak tea to hang your hat on."" The tense and punishing final series of turns is all very Greek and gothic (and not in that cuddly Eugenides way) but at the end of it all I found myself wanting wisdom a little friendlier, more familiar, and fresh."
4,I Know What You Did Last Semester,"I haven't laughed so hard in years. Is there anyone more pretentious than a liberal arts freshman college student who thinks he belongs inThe Great GatsbyorBrideshead Revisited? This would be a great selection for book club, there are plenty of topics for discussion (for example: is Richard a reliable narrator?), but, alas, at 500+ pages, my book club would kill me.I ended up thinking the author 1) could have used a good editor to carve 200-300 pages out of this beast and 2) is a GENIUS - the way she precisely paints the characters and all their faults and foibles, you could see and feel them.Was this book intended to be dark comedy? I have no idea. It reminded me a bit of that movieThe Last Supper. (I don't like to post spoilers, but people who have never watched television trying to plot a murder with things they learned out of Greek classics made me laugh so hard I almost cried.)"
3,"Occasionally pleasing, but essentially disappointing","Interminably bored in the insignificant town of Plano, Richard Papen applies to Hampden College in Vermont, an area of the country completely foreign to him, on a whim. Upon arrival, his involvement with an ominous group of variably erudite students irrevocably leads him down a road of deception and, eventually, great misfortune.Though gloriously detailed and occasionally oddly comical, the story is unwittingly exhausting in its attempts at suspense. I found nothing suspenseful or thrilling about this novel, and I became irked with my great distaste for each and every character. Teeming with immoral and idiotic characters and fundamentally just a ridiculously lengthy tale of depression, I found it hard to enjoy it as much as most reviewers apparently did. I preferred 'The Little Friend'."
5,Everyone I recommended it to seemed to really enjoy it.,"I really enjoyed this novel. My brother recommended it to me but the first time I read it I was in the middle of a rather hectic semester. I remember wishing I'd had more time to devote to it. So, I read it again during Christmas break. The second read was even more enjoyable. I have recommended this book to several people including three English professors. After they returned the novel, two of them implied that my ethical sensibilities may be a bit warped for having found the tale so delightful. But, I gotta tell you, they never pass up an opportunity to discuss the story with me. I personally haven't met anyone who read it who didn't like it."
5,"A stunning, gut-wrenching mystery!","Good God! This is, and has been my favorite novel since I first read it years ago. It has become the touchstone by which I rate all contemporary novels, be they in the suspense genre or otherwise. It is by turns, bleak, paranoid, lush, claustrophobic, sublime, gothic, hyper-intellectual, and finely wrought. The Greek passages (which some have found dry) were intriguing and utterly engaging. How well Ms. Tartt captures the ethos of a select group of misanthropes and intellectual snobs in a a contemporary university setting! This story has insinuated itself into my pysche and her characters live and breathe with such honest clarity...I have heard that Donna Tartt has almost completed her second novel, which should be out sometime in 1999."
2,There was book in there somewhere....,"This book reminded me of a Burt Lancaster movie I saw a long time ago called ""The Swimmer."" Burt swims across Connecticut through his neighbors' pools. The unrelenting emptiness of the suburban lives he encounters forces him to face his own directionless, purposeless existence. Tartt shares the conceit of whomever was behind that film: I am good, not because I am moral or even because I have escaped the hellish treadmill of modern life, but because I am fully aware of our tragic situation and can stand slightly apart, observing from a partially detached and sardonic perspective. I'm not free but I at least know I'm in prison.I kept hoping for hope, expecting a glimmer, seeking a ray of redemption. I rode all half a thousand pages right to the end and was rewarded with ashes and despair. For me, the hopelessness of this tragi-Greek drama made it an unpleasant read. Good writing can only carry a book so far; there has got to be a destination."
1,"Puffery, triteness, tedium","Don't believe people who tell you this book is 'spellbinding' or 'beautifully written'. Indeed, it opens with the end then spends 400 odd pages on puffery, triteness, tedium and pathetic endeavours at high-brow, literary credence in a meak attempt to make that 'end' interesting. Ms. Tartt has floundered, badly, where the likes of Patrick Suskind flourish."
1,How 'bout some coherent development?,"Donna Tartt has a solid grasp of the English language, but she doesn't have the faintest clue as to what she should do with it. Certainly not waste any of it on developing trifles such as relationships, characters, pacing or plot. A 280-page (AT MOST) book was thrown on her personal rack and revamped as a weighty tome guaranteed to cure insomnia. It had absolutley nothing to do over the course of the last third before she wraps up the project in an utterly absurd ""climax."" The icing on the cake, however, comes in the epilogue: Tartt cobbles together a wrap-up that seems to have roots in the ""crawls"" that appear at the end of an awful TV movie of the week. There is probably a very good reason that she hasn't done anything since: she is completely inept when it comes to storytelling."
5,The book that changed how I look at the world.,"I have read ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt more times than I can remember; but one thing I do remember is that no matter how many times I have read it, I still can never put it down! Reading this book makes one look differently at the world around them; casting a irresistable spell that lures the reader into Tartt's complex world of intelligence, betrayal, and the strength of the human spirit. This book is first rate genious that deserves to be read by everyone"
1,SKIP THIS MESS,"If you enjoy this book then you do not have the slightest idea of what a good story is. With so many wonderful books to read I recommend skipping this one and getting on with your life.Is the author serious with her character names: A big, strong athlete named ""Bunny,"" twins ""Charles and Camellia"" and one character who is too similar to a high-level soccer player - continually takes my mind away from the story and brings it somewhere else.There are too many plot deficiencies and if I had not been reading it for a book club reading I would have thrown the book into oncoming traffic & left it there."
3,Good story but too long.,"I give Secret History three stars because the story is original and the writing is often inspired, and that is the only reason I trudged through its 502 pages (paperback). There are far too many insignificant details that do not advance the story. 34 pages to cover poor Bunny's funeral, WOW. I was in more pain than the bereaved. The story would have been a winner at 250 pages and Donna could have saved a trainload of booze and cigarettes. On the plus side the characters are all well described, complex, flawed, and dysfunctional. Aren't those are the ingredients of most good stories."
1,Ugh ......... It was torture!,"I had HIGH HIGH hopes for ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. But, I was completely let down. I think I should have read the Amazon Reader Review's before I dove in head first. This book is probably the most unreadable thing I have ever encountered. I rarely and I mean RARELY give up on a book, but this one went straight back and was never finished. It's not worth the time!"
3,Over-wrought,"Begins with great promise. Falls apart in the field. A ""Who really cares?"" story about shallow pseudo-intellectuals that could only be lauded by the same. Lacks wisdom and depth of insight."
2,"pretentious, formulaic, and highly over-rated","Tossing in phrases in Latin and Ancient Greek does not make a novel good. Shallow, self-involved, and depressing characters does nothing to improve it, either. The author tries to fool her audience into believing that this brush with ""High Culture"" makes her book noteworthy. If anything, referencing the greats only highlights her own work's shortcomings."
4,Gently used,"The book was gently used, with underlining and writing in the margins of several pages. This is how it was advertised, and was very acceptable."
2,"Wordy, wordy, wordy","This book should have been shortened by at least 250 pages. The author droned on and on seemingly trying to amaze the reader with her knowledge of Greek. All characters but for the main six were barely fleshed out making the epilog at the end detailing their updated histories confusing at best. I found it hard to understand how six college students could be so ""brilliant"" when they spent their days drinking, drugging, smoking, taking uppers, taking downers, dancing in the woods, murdering a man, planning and carrying out another murder and still have time to make it to class. In the end, it was sad most all got away with their silly, pathetic lives."
5,Great Romantic Suspense Read.,"Anna Dunning is being stalked. She doesn't have a clue why or who would want to hurt her, but after several months of tortureing phone calls and messages she finally has a close encounter with her stalker. She doesn't see his face but she recognizes his husky whispers.Mark Righter is a former police detective, who has quit the force under a cloud. He is proud and stubborn. He is hired by Anna's brother to protect her and find out who is stalking her.Anna is not willing at first to admit that she needs a protector. But after a frightening incident when her stalker almost gets her, she is left with no choice.Two strong, stubborn people have to learn to trust each other. Anna has to learn that she needs Mark for her own protection. When they start to fall for each other it's hard to concentrate on one thing at a time, but if they don't Anna will be dead.Good book, good plot and good reading."
3,"Good, but...","It was a good story, but the Anna and Mark just didn't have what it takes to make a good story. I thought Anna was a whiner and of course Mark is just such a macho man. Pretty boring story."
5,Excellent Ford Ranger Product,"The paint quality is perfect. Product fits well with no modifications. Spare tire is unaffected, although you may want to lower it slightly when installing the hitch to provide access. Loosening all the bumper bolts slightly will provide some slight adjustment and allow the OEM clip nuts to rotate slightly and clear the provided spacers better. Reciever hole fits draw bar nicely without any excess play. Easy to attach saftey chains. About a 15 minute job even unassisted on the floor without a jack. Only ratchet, socket and extension needed to install as the spacer plates hold the ""carriage"" style bolts from turning in the frame rail."
5,Great Hitch,"This is the 2nd Curt hitch I have installed. The 1st was a class III on a 2005 Crown Vic. The 1 was on my sons 1997 Ford Ranger. Easy install, 2 bolts on each side and your done. Oh ya only 2 holes to drill."
4,Fun and Different,Most of the programs in this series are fun and interesting. The stories are more original and it's nice to see women in the lead.
4,This Series is great!,This series is great for mystery lovers! The two main characters are funny and work well together. The series show how their characters develop and grow during the different mysteries they encounter.
3,Felicity forever! But---,"I could happily watch Felicity Kendal knit mittens. Her face and manner win me entirely. Give her a good role, like Viola in ""Twelfth Night,"" and she delights beyond compare. But here she is let down by mediocre writing. Come on, writers! Watch ""As Time Goes By,"" and get with it!"
3,Ho hum and not for little kids,"I purchased this partly because Felicity Kendal was in it and it sounded fun and interesting. We don't watch much television and when we watched it with our 5 and 7 yr old, it was a bit too intense. And some language as well. The acting seemed a bit stilted too. Sometimes you just don't know til you watch."
2,Poor Editing,"This series has some decent plot ideas and good acting by the cast. The director and especially the editor is the problem. There's non-stop background music, which is okay at the start of a scene, but the darn stuff never stops. After a while you want to yell ""Cut that darn stuff out. For pete's sake.""The feeling I got is that the writer, the director, and the editor, all, don't trust the viewers' intelligence and in addition don't have confidence in their story line. Why else would they supply continuous distraction? The experience was so frustrating that I couldn't stand watching more than one episode, and a half of a second episode. What a pity that such an excellent cast and production values have had to go to waste."
2,I've never felt so alone...,"Am I (a transplanted Brit in America) the only person in the world who has not been beguiled by this series, hard as I have tried? Am I the only one who would appreciate rather more plausible circumstances? It takes me a whole afternoon (not counting the trip to the nursery) to replant a tiny garden bed, and I come in looking like I've been dragged through a hedge backward. They achieve astonishing feats of horticulture without breaking a sweat and never race home, screaming ""I must have a shower this very minute!"" In a recent episode (I don't know which series it comes from, sorry), they redesigned a ginormous walk in Regent's Park, solved a rather silly pair of murders on no reliable evidence, figured out who was stealing their plants, took in a three-legged dog, reunited two (count 'em) sets of long-lost lovers, and redecorated Laura's daughter's flat, all without much visible effort. What??? Petty as this quibble may be, I find this show virtually unwatchable."
4,Squimin Upstream,"We were not familiar with Rosemary and Thyme, but enjoyed British mysteries and took a chance on this series. It is better than we had hoped providing a pleasing mixure of comedy and mystery. The stars of the program are an unlikely couple whose personal lives and quirks add considerable interest. The storylines sometimes stretch the imagination, but that only adds to the fun,. It is probable we will purchase the next season once we have finsihed viewing what we have. It is highly recommended."
3,Ok - but not great,"Ordered this series for my wife, and I actually enjoyed them more than she did. That's not saying much because I will watch anything. The program is entertaining but a little contrived and predictable. Probably will not order additional releases."
2,no closed captioning,"the show is done well, the characters are fun but if you need the closed captioning there is none... even though the site says that it is included... i hope they remedy this fault..."
2,wouldn't recommend it,"Love Felcity Kendal in Good Neighbors, but this mystery stuff doesn't cut it plot wise"
5,Rosemary and Thyme,"I love this mystery series. The distinct personalities of the two ""detectives"" are as complimentary to each other as are the herbs that are their namesakes. There is always plenty of mystery and suspense as well as a little humor."
3,Not a definitive resource,"This book has had praise heaped upon it by previous reviewers. I'd like to put that in perspective. As an undergraduate text or a general encyclopedic reference for the unitiated, this book is reasonably comprehensive and contains substantial high-quality illustrations. However as a reference for more advanced students, there is insufficient detail to motivate serious discussion. I find ""Principles of Neural Science"" by Kandel, Schwartz, and Jessell far more useful despite being a year older than Bear, et al. If the goal is to lift artwork for a pleasingly graphical PowerPoint presentation, this book is a fantastic resource, but if you want more than jargon and an introduction to the topic (albeit comprehensive), I'd look elsewhere."
2,Neuro book,"It only includes very basic neuroscience, and did not help me with my college level introductory class for rehab science majors."
5,This Really is a Great Deal,"When the price of the leather case was less than the shipping I had two thoughts: 1) This has to be junk, its way too cheap to have any quality, 2) Hey, for the price, what the heck. What I received was a pleasant surprise: a good quality product for an unbelievable price. The case is far better than the original with a 2-magnet positive closure (no more playing games with the latch to get it to close). The stitching is good and the leather looks like it should hold up well. The belt clasp has a pretty strong spring that takes a little work to get over the belt but is less incline to come off. I expect the leather on the belt side of the clasp will wear off eventually, but that's where number 2 kicks in above. I recommend the case as a great value."
4,Something New Under the Sun,"I like the book because of the historical perspective on the detrimental effects of the environment with selected topics, although I am preferring my other book which tells the stories of different places on the what the effects of the environment has had over the years of human civilization. Still, both are quite good..."
2,So it's not a dry history...,"It's ideas are sound, but it's all stats. This year there was this much and hey look now it's tripled, quadrupled, whatever... Just reading the conclusions of each chapter will give you everything that you need to know."

2,Slipped through quality control,"As the cable arrived, the DVI connector didn't fit. The connectors are always at the back of the TV, in the dark, without any lamp light, so it took a while to find out that the connector itself was not formed well. By looking at it carefully, the shield around the pins was too narrow. But, no dents: uniformly disformed. Funny enough one pin was smashed against the other in another direction than the damage to the shield. As far as I can see this is production damage that slipped through quality control. I took out the jewelry tool box and straightened everything out. Now the cable connects and happily functions between my blu-ray and TV.As for the attributes of the cable, the cable is not of sound quality, I don't blame the supplier but the manufacturer. Or maybe I should blame the supplier for accepting bad quality from its suppliers."
2,"Occasionally ""Freaks Out""","This cable looks nice, when you don't linger on a digital channel. What happens to me is that if I leave the TV on a digital channel overnight, the next day it will be a split screen mode, showing double image of the broadcast. To fix it, I have to change it to a non-digital channel and switch it back. I guess it is possible that it is the cable box, but nothing happens like that on the Component outputs."
1,Spiderman Water Shooter,Never would buy or recommend this! It looks like a fun toy but didn't last but an hour with my 4 yr old son. I couldn't even position properly so it would look like it did in the picture. Waste of money!!!
5,Great to See Pittsburgh,I bought this while working on a genealogy search. Since I grew up in Pittsburgh I wanted to see some familiar areas during a time prior to my birth. The book brought back fond memories and arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
5,Great CD,"While I wasn't a big fan of the Experiencing God study, I really like this CD. It has some great songs like The River, All Your Works are Wonderful, The Day I lay My Isaac Down, and the song I bought it for Unrelenting Love. And it has some of my favorite artists: Point of Grace, Greg Long, The Martins, and Susan Ashton.My only complaint is I wish they had used more popular artists on three of the songs on the album. I have never heard of Rob Mathes, Kyle Matthews, or Brenda Schulte."
2,"Cheesy, cliché but sooooo funny. I laughed so much until I almost cried!","It's the most hyped, fake, and silly spy story I have ever seen in my life: cheesy, cliché but sooooo funny.I enjoyed it. I laughed a lot until I almost cried!The tragedy is on the producer/actors's side.They were and still are convinced that they made a...serious masterpiece instead of a laughing-out-loud piece of entertainment.Now that they know, hopefully they will change genre in the future and make a comedy, in order that we may be moved to tears this time.That would be nice!Interesting to see the reviews on this one all over the place! I could not recommend highly enough this one to any of my friends or family, and their children as well! Ugh!"
2,bad movie,this movie was awful. the action scenes were not related and at times used for shock value only. this is a below average bollywood movie. spare yourself the pain
3,"Popa Chubby - some good, some bad, some ugly","I bought this CD based on hearing one song and still like the one song. His schtick if you will is that he fits neatly in no mold - not blues, not rock, and certainly not hip-hop (though there are some aspirations). The recordings are a bit harsh and I suppose you can blame that on the production. The songs are mostly mediocre. Where he does best is when is stays in the blues-rock idiom and plays accordingly...these leads are where he can shine.A great singer? No, but he can hold his own.The right set of songs and the right production crew and I think I would like him better. This album isn't it."
1,Take a pass on this one....,"Disapointing. Crude lyrics, little thought or effort shown here. Had heard good things and expected more. Guitar work above average,lyrics disturb the flow. Sept 2, 2003 - After listening to several other CDs by Popa Chubby, this review can used for all his work."
2,This film is expired and it shows,Film is expired by 3.5 years and only performs marginally. Nowhere in the product description does it state the fact that this is expired film. Colors are washed out and this product is not worth the money at all. On the other hand shipping was extremely fast. This technology is a dinosaur and this transaction proves it.
2,Spectra Film,"This is an old film. I have opened the pack so I am keeping it. The colors are all brownish hue after curing. First I thought maybe the light or exposure, but its on all pictures taken any time."
1,Expired Film!!,I ordered 2 - 10 packs of this film and they were expired. Each exposure came out brown and yellow.Check before you buy!
1,unsatisfied,Film expired but not mentioned in the ad. Payed 48.00 for it and it was not good.Very disapointing. I would have payed more for film that wasn't expired.
1,No Stars,"Film received in such poor quality, sent back to supplier for replacement or refund. If not resolved properly, shall back up charge through Amazon."
1,polaroid spectra film,"i have a macro 7 polaroid for my dental office. film's no longer made so buying some dated or expired film is a bit of a gamble. most of the time it works, but i've had a few defective packages of this film."
4,Spectra and ny Colorshot printer,"Provides very nice results with my Polaroid Colorshot printer which I'm still able to use under Windows XP even though there is no driver...The trick is to download and install Microsoft's FREE (yes FREE!) Virtual PC Software and install Windows '98 on this virtual PC. You can then install Polaroid's 98 driver on it as well and continue to make ""real"" photos until the film supply runs out..."
1,Terrible customer service and product description,"For someone who was buying polaroid film for the first time, the description was awful. No where did it say it did not fit a 600 camera. When the film arrived and it didn't fit I called Ace right away and they refused to give me a refund and told me I should have known the film wouldn't fit. I was put on hold numerous times, not alowed to speak to a supervisor and utimately hung up on. I will NEVER shop from them again."
1,Challenge: Bet you can't read this one,"I picked this up at a booksale for $1.00. Too much. I don't think I have ever seen so many meaningless sentences in a single place. Try this one: ""Romantic literary forms have an instinct for turning into their opposites, attaining freedom by self-contradiction."" Or this: ""While Les Troyens is exotically asymmetrical, Wagner's forms have a fearful symmetry, forbiddingly self-sufficient."" It is like that throughout. I returned it to the book sale and snuck it back onto the table."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I could not get into this book at all. Slow, slow starter and I could not even finish it. I gave up at page 123. This is the first I have read in her series and will not read another.Disappointed."
1,Avoid This 'One Step Beyond',"This is the only t.v. series that ever impressed me; yes, I liked other series, but this was the one for me. I was very disapppointed with this version for the low quality transfer. Avoid this version of the series at all costs, unless you are a true devotee of 'One Step Beyond.' This DVD transfer is abysmal at best. Some of the introductions and exits of the episodes, and even some of the episodes, are cut short. The images are dark to very dark at times and are not very clear with unwanted sounds in the background that occur every once in a while. This is a very inexpensive transfer to DVD and leaves a lot to want. I decided to purchase the Paramount DVD, which, from what I read, is superior."
1,What a waste!,Save your money. Horrible picture & sound quality. I'm returning the set. Much smarter to wait for CBS to release improved versions.
2,not such a great deal,"I bought the 5 DVD set of ""The Best 50 Episodes"" and the picture quality is the best I've seen of reissues.....BUT the biggest benefit was the price...I only paid $14.99 for it"
3,TV series on DVD,"Quality could have been better, many of the episodes had obvious dust in the gate, should have been prescreened before the transfer."
3,Allis Chalmers NOPARKING SIGN,"a little disappointed - the letters are more redish instead of allis chalmer orange, and they are stuck on letters instead of painted on---I hope they stay stuck!"
3,"don't get swept up in the ""sensor"" - it's a crappy monitor","While the sensor is a great feature and certainly offers peace of mind (which is why we got it), the actual monitoring leaves much to be desired. The monitor is very prone to interference, has terrible range and constantly ""hisses"".. there is no sound-activated feature where it's muted while there is no or almost no noise. This is particularly annoying at night. The build quality is also pretty bad. One of our transmitters fell about 3 feet and broke immediately."
1,Won't work if baby moves a lot,"Do not waste your money on this product if you have a baby that moves a lot in the crib!!!We used it for a week until we just got tired of the 10 false alarms we had every night, because my daughter moves a lot in her crib, and often ends up against the rail (and never the same one). It was very stressful for us, and for her, so we just stopped using it.Now, I would have given it 3 stars, because it does work for a lot of people, but I called their customer service and they said it's pretty much normal for it to beep a lot if you have a baby that moves a lot. I just wish they mentioned this in their product description, because now I'm out $70.So this really deserves one star for me. If your baby doesn't move too much, it should work though."
2,a little disappointed,I thought that this was a great product but when I went to get the last pack of the three pack it was busted. The outside package looked fine but when I opened it the container was busted and the film was not any good. I just thought that I would give my review.
1,Doesn't fit 1995 Altima,"Just as an FYI, although Amazon's Part Finder says that it should fit a 1995 Nissan Altima, it didn't. The valve cover gasket does not fit my valve cover. It's mostly my fault, I would usually get more images of a part for my car to make sure it would actually fit, but I've had previous success with Amazon's Part Finder so I bought it sight unseen. Won't be doing that again. Again just an FYI."
5,"PRAISE GOD, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH","I received my copy of the Sacred Love Songs CD today. My husband and I listened to it together. It was awesome. Every song was right on time. You know, it feels good to be able to set the mood for intimacy with songs that lift up the name of the Lord. This piece of work was well worth the wait. I HOPE THIS WON'T BE THE LAST ONE. God gave us music and anointed musicians. He gave us love and intimacy. Let's stop acting like it's a ""dirty"" thing to get close and be real in all of our God inspired relationships. Then and only then will we be able to tell a darkened world that we really do have the ""real thing"".Love you Bishop T. D. Jakes for keepin' it real."
5,Spiritual Blessing,"This is a blessing from the Lord. I enjoy lovemaking music and since my husband and I are both Christians now, there was nothing for us to listen to until Bishop Jakes came out with this soul-stirring CD. We can now enjoy love songs and there's no guilt and no second guessing if it is right or wrong. I feel more close to my husband when I listen to this and it makes me realize that God was in the midst of our joining together."
5,A TRUE BLESSING,WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOME CHRISTIAN SONGS FOR OUR UP COMING WEDDING AND THIS ALBUM REALLY EXPRESSED A LOT OF THE FEELINGS MY FIANCE AND I FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER . THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH FOR LETTING GOD LEAD YOU IN THIS! ! ! HOPE YOU MAKE SOME MORE SONGS AND OTHER LOVE ABLUMS !
5,AWSOME!!,My husband bought this home and I am buying it for friends. You have never heard love songs like this. It will take Christian music to another level!! It has something for everyone. Barry White get back 'cause TD Jakes is smokin'!
3,Is it just me or......,"....am I the only one who sees the hypocracy of this? A love song is a love song is a love song. So many times Christians want ot talk about people ""out in the world"" making music just like this. Don't get me wrong, I liked the C.D, but I didn't see the difference in listening to this or listening to Brian McKnight's song 'Back at One'. If two people are married, it makes no difference WHO put out the love song, whether it be Jakes or McKnight. The only difference is if the church folks(some) see Brian's CD they'll make it like you backsliding, but if Jakes' name is on it, it MUST be ok. Like I said before: a love song is a love song is a love song. And this CD has some nice ones on it."
1,Poor quality,I had no problem with the seller or delivery but the motion sensor on the floodlight was defective.The Cds photocell would allow the light to be activated when it was hours before dusk. The photocell was angled and improperly positioned in the clear sleeve. Even after correcting the sensor placement it barely helped. Letting the photocell protrude from the bottom of sensor unit did not work. Poor circuit design or defective components.
5,sharam dubai,if you are a fan you wont be surprised if you arent well if you dont get this you dont get dance music technically brilliant & its moves you to that deep dish place buy it now & play it loud
3,OK.,"It is ok, but not what I expected from Sharam (this is the same comment I wrote in GU 31 - Dubfire). I think I liked this one a little bit more.It looks like this two borthers work better together (as Deep Dish)."
5,Sharam killing it in Dubai,ok so yes gu kills it and we all know deep dish are gods in ther own right but Sharam sets it off on these diskssteady groves seamless mixes another gu classic
4,ok,"I heard both CDs. I actually like the 2nd CD better; it sounds more like what he plays in the late hours/afterhours. My favorite Deep Dish CD is GU Moscow. However, I like this one better than GU Toronto.CD 2 is five starsCD 1 is 3 1/2 stars"
4,delicious,This is way better than the george album and just as good if not better than GU toronto or moscow.
5,Wicked!,Both discs are very enjoyable. no matter what mood you are in there is a track for that mood on this cd. defiently my fav cd of 2006.Go buy this CDev
3,I hate to be the bearer of bad news but...,"It's been a while since GU released something worth purchasing. This release happens to go along with this trend. Sharam seems to follow the same pattern as with the recent Deep Dish releases. Brilliant at times, but awefully commercial and downright cheezy at other times. It's very sad to see the rise and fall of the legendary duo. I have even noticed their live sets also on the downturn. If the live performance of a DJ ever turns for the worst...it is usually a sign that the end of near.There are several points during the set that you think ""hey, this could be good!"" Then some tacky vocal track (and I like vocals) comes on to ruin the mood."
3,would be good if.....,incorrect edition. didn't have the date of publication listed so I took a chance and got it wrong.
4,Energetic & beautiful,"I'm so glad I accidentally stumbled across this album. Top songs for me -""Restless State"" & ""Seven Miles"". Smooth, memorable lyrics. Musicians are incredible - wonderful sound and Carrie's voice sets a beautiful tone - a bit of Alison Krauss with a kick.This album is a good reminder of why I love folk and country so much. It gets you back to the roots. Love it! Good luck Carrie and band!"
5,"Carrie Hassler, New Rising Star","Carrie Hassler is a new rising star in bluegrass music. Carrie Hassler and Hard Rain is ""hard driving bluegrass"" in one song and soulful bluegrass with the next. Definitely worth the listen."
2,A little disappointed,"After getting to see Carrie in person, I purchased CHHR2 (the second cd) - it is awesome. Then I purchased this one. The first 2 songs would not play on any of my players and the entire cd was lack-lustre compared to #2. She has a great vopice and I would certainly recommend CHHR2 - skip this cd."
1,Fungible,"The Problem with this book is that it does not consider the fact that money is fungible, and as such has been used not only for graft, but to purchase weapons that defeat the very peace it it supposed to build. With Arab Palestinians now armed to the teeth, with rockets that can reach the heart of Israel, we can and should start to take off our blinders about the harm that has been done by the international welfare system created to support this people. For it is not supporting the people, it is not bettering their lives. Rather, the money has been used to line the pockets of corrupt fasict leaders, whose sole purpose remains the complete cultural, economic and military destruction of the Jewish state. Would it were not so, but those are the facts that this author and too many press pundits ignore."
3,Leaving Fishers,"The book 'Leaving Fishers' by Margaret Peterson Haddix is an okay book by my standards. It had a good plot and fully-developed characters but somehow it didn't keep my attention for very long like some of her other books. My favorite of hers is 'Running Out of Time'. Overall, 'Leaving Fishers' was a good book. I would recommend it to people who like sort of mystery books because it is very ominous and spooky."
2,Disapointed reader,"I read the book ""Leaving Fishers"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix. I thought that the book was very different and odd. I didn't like the book all that much. But I did like how the book got you curious and it made you keep reading. This book shows a good example of how some people do anything just to fit in and make people like them."
1,yuck,"now i'm not much of a critic but the book ""leaving Fishers"" is one that i found to lose my attention very often, but in some cases it would make me want to realy see what is going on in the Dorry's life, but still i still will find the book quite bad and if or boring, under my standards the book was completly boring and find no interest in wanting to rea it. now the book ""Running out of time"" wasn't that bad but compared to ""Leaving Fishers"" it was great. that just comes to show that the book Leaving Fishers wa completly boring and unnecessary."
4,Interesting Book,"I thought that this book as very good, but at times boring. The story was very creative and it showed something that could happen to anyone who just happens to be the right type of person and in the right place at the right time. I hadn't heard very much about religous cults until i read this. Margaret Haddix is one of the best authors out their for teens. She comes up with the greatest storylines. If you like this book I strongly recommend you read ""running out of time"" which is also by Haddix. Bye BYe Bye"
3,Well written but falls short,Haddix is a talented writer who portrays realistic characters. However the book doesn't explore the thoughts that drive people to such actions deeply enough. I put this one down feeling like more could have been said.
3,Leaving Fishers,Hello my name is Nicole. The book Leaving Fishers was an okay book. I was waiting for an exciting ending but it just ended. Overall the plot was well written. To me I think the best part of a book is the begining and the ending so that is why I only give this book 3 stars. Thank you for reading my book review. Bye
4,Read it until dawn..,"Once I had started, I didn't want to stop. It was a very captivating book.The only complaint I have is that the way Dorry talked in the book at times wore a little on my nerves, but overall it is an excellent book."
5,A fresh outlook on faith v. fanatic,"""Leaving Fishers"" is about a 15 or 16 year old girl named Dorry who moves from Indianapolis from small-town Ohio. She's all alone in school, until this great group of kids ask her to eat with them. They're all beautiful, smart, and confident, and they quickly accept her. Soon, she finds out that they're part of a religious group called ""Fishers of Men"", and they want her to join. Against her better judgement, she does, and feels enlightened, happy, and fufilled--at first. Soon, the group's expectations of her rise. She finds herself turning away everything in her old life to please the Fishers. But one day, their expectations get so high, and she's forced to step back and asess the situation. It's a great story with developed characters and real conflict. I recommend it to anyone."
3,Prevention against cults.,"Daring to say, this is a story fit for a theme ""Family Dealing with Change"". This made me recollect a recent(?) terrorism by a cult in Japan. I think this is a chilling portrait of an insecure teenager gradually being mind-controlled by a cult. This may be useful as prevention against recruitment by cults."
4,This is an awesome book!,"Margret Peterson Haddix's Leaving Fishers is a great story about Dorry, a girl that gets caught up in a cult. Dorry moves to a new town and soon becomes friends with a religious group called Fishers. At first Dorry's friends are so kind she can't believe it, but later on they make her make huge sacrifices. These sacrifices make her parents and boss angry. Because of Fishers her grades, which were once honor roll, go down to failing. I recommend this book to anyone ages 13 and up. This novel is definitely one of my favorites."
3,"(Vol. 2) -Theoretically challenging, but not very practical","This book is much better than volume 1, in that it gets to the subject implied in the title. However, instead of what I think of as practical knowledge, it spoke primarily in the realm of the metaphysical and theoretical. I can't dispute the author's claims on a theoretical basis, but I really doubt people are going to regenerate their missing limbs like a salamander anytime soon. The piece about miracles I think is attainable, but with much difficulty. The most practical method exposed, relatively speaking of course, is the notion of at least two possibilities for each situation. According to Kabbalah, seeing is not necessarily believing, but I would say that my apparent lack of faith dictates that I am skeptical about some of the things in this book. Examples and actions will always speak louder than words. If you want something similar, but more worldly, try Gregg Braden's writings."
4,"A good introduction to skepticism, but not quite perfect","As a skeptic myself, I thought this would be the right book to illustrate my viewpoint. The book did that, but my biggest concern is that Alexander Fox questioned the ""psychic's"" abilities, but never really exposed the wizard behind the curtain. I'm still sure the Bloodhound Gang (the 3-2-1 segment, not the ""Bad Touch"" band) would have did a better job, and in fact they did (in one of their installments, they figured an alleged ""psychic"" who correctly predicted the return of a lost pet, as Arkady Mystikos had done, had been behind the pet's disappearance in the first place). But I do enjoy the idea of a skeptical investigator, and I would like to see more of Alexander Fox in other cases in the future."
5,Another Excellent CD,"If you are a fan of gospel music, whether traditional or comtemporary, you owe it to yourself to check out the Canton Spirituals. To me, they are the best gospel group out there. Their music is fresh, uplifting and never boring. This CD continues a line of truly excellent albums by the group. The Live Experience, Live in Memphis, Live in DC, and this CD are my favorite and I've been listening to them over and over again for he last 3 years (when I first started listening to Gospel). Also, the videos are really good and allow you to get even more feeling from the music and a deeper appreciation for the group's talent. I do not think any gospel fan will be disappointed with this CD. I also recommend The Christianaires ""Thank You"" and Rance Allen's ""Miracle Worker"" cds. Willie Neal Johnson's ""The Country boy goes home"" is also good."
1,Not great at all.,"Kids didn't even realize that this was the rabbit from the book or movie. Within the first day, the ear was tattered. Overall, not a smart purchase."
2,Missing excitement,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I didn't think this album had that many good songs on it. It's more like an album of leftovers."
4,"""Mr. James""",This CD has some of the best songs from Rick James when his God given gift of song was intact! R.I.P. Mr. James.
3,"Useful, if tedious","Gathorne Hardy was one of the most prominent politicians of his time, serving in every Conservative government from 1866 to 1892. Though an obscure figure today, he was an asset in mid-ranking Cabinet offices and nearly succeeded Disraeli as the leader in the House of Commons in 1876. Throughout his career he also kept a diary of the events of his life, from which Nancy Johnson extracted the politically relevant sections presented in this volume.Though a monumental edition, the passages here hardly make for pleasure reading. Most of it is tedious and discreet; there is none of the gossip or the nuances of politics that make other published editions of personal writings from the period (such as the Trelawny diaries or Disraeli's letters) interesting reading. Nevertheless, there is much of use here for the student of Victorian politics, as the entries give us a view into the life of a political leader of the era."
4,Betula Boogie - Sandals,"This is a good sandal, has good arch support ( a Birkenstock bed), however I should have listened to the information about the bed of the sandal being narrower than the original birkinstock. I am learning to really like these, and they feel good on my feet. The suede feels, but it can stretch so do watch for that. A size 38 in Birkenstocks is a size 8 Women't shoe, It is about a 7.5 in Betula. Please be aware of that. Otherwise the sandal is a very good one, well worth the money, and it feels nice on my feet."
1,not available,"I tried to order these but despite saying they were available from the main page, I had to go through entire order process to find they were not available."
3,Betula sandals,"Betula sandals are affordable and comfortable. I own Birkenstock sandals also and the Betulas come very close to the Birkenstocks. I haven't had them very long yet, so I can't comment on how long they will last."
2,Betula Birkenstock,"I do believe that this product is a type of Birkenstock, or maybe they have a license to sell as a Birkenstock, but they are not the Original Birkenstock as they claim to be.I did not appreciate the service I received from Midwest Sports. Choosing the size by the sizing chart and comparing it to my shoe size, I thought I chose the correct size; but it was not, it was a size larger. So I had to exchange them. Not only did I have to pay for the postage to return the item, I was also charged to have the correct size mailed back to me. In my past experiences, the dealer has always been the one to pay for the postage.Will I purchase from Midwest Sports again? No."
3,Only good for narrow feet,"The description on these shoes says ""narrow, equivalent to US medium"". Don't believe this. Narrow on the box means narrow in the US too. I ordered a pair for my medium-sized feet after my Medium width birks wore out. The pair came and they were waaayy too narrow. Returned them and bought real birks in Med. width which do fit my feet."
2,Men's sizes only come in narrow,"I was disappointed, as they neglect to tell you that the men's sizes are narrow. I had to call and request a return slip. At first, customer service tried to convince me that a European narrow was the same as a standard US size; however, my husband has owned several pairs of these sandals before, and these were the only ones that did not fit. So, I think the standard available here is not necessarily a European narrow. After some persuasion, they did agree to send me a return slip. I mailed it back and was credited the full amount on my Visa promptly."
1,Unsatisfied,These sandals did not hold up even for a couple months. The leather ripped halfway up. No help at all from the company. The washed their hands of it. Would not buy this brand again and would not buy from this company again.
3,You get what you pay for (barely),"First off, the footbeds seem fine though not quite as sculptured as real Birks - that's the good news. The bad news is that if you're uncool like me and wear these with socks, the straps will turn them grey (I have the black sandals). Also, the straps have no rigidity like my authentic Birks. They are made of cheap, floppy, faux-leather material that you can't easily slip your feet into, i.e. you have to bend over and raise the straps with your hand to get your feet into place, so don't expect slipper-like ease of use. The pictures make the straps look much more substantial than they really are. I wish I had paid for the real deal. Rating: 2 1/2 stars - I rounded up to 3 because they are relatively inexpensive and do cushion my feet adequately."
4,Betula,Comfortable once worn in. I had my last pair for 4 years so they fit me perfectly so it was kinda dissapointing to go through the process again
3,Sandals,The size chart wasn't right.They were a little to long.the worst part is the strips were to short.
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I WOULD NOT BUY BIRKENSTOCK AGAIN. IT IS EXPENSIVE AND WORKMANSHIP IS MEDIOCRE. ONLY AFTER A FEW MONTHS, THE STRAP BECAME UNGLUED. WHEN I CONTACTED BIRKENSTOCK, THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING, EVEN THOUGH I SENT THEM PICTURES OF THE SHOE."
2,Don't get it,"I don't understand what people see in these sandals. I ordered a pair and they were so big I couldn't keep them on. However, I kept them, and recently I have gained some weight - even in my feet. Also, I broke my toe a few days ago, so I thought I would try these sandals again. Well, they did feel good for the toe, but my right foot made such a sucking noise when I walked that I changed to another shoe. I didn't want everyone in the store looking at me because of the sucking noise. I just don't get it."
2,Don't buy these unless you have narrow feet,"Hidden in the fine print when ordering Betula sandals from Midwest Sports is the fact that these are sized ""narrow"", which Midwest claims is the same as normal width in the United States. I've been wearing these for a couple of weeks now and realize they are too narrow for me -- my feet hurt! I always wear normal width shoes which I believe is a ""D"" width. So, unless you know that you have narrow feet, I would not buy these."
1,betula...,The shoes are great but the price is not good... i bought the same shoes at payless shoe source for $14.99...they are licenced by birkenstock but they arent infact actual birkenstocks. i dont know why they are so cheep there but i advise you to go there and save yourself some extra cash...(exscuse my spelling errors)
4,parradise,"Dont let the appearance fool you,There is no compaisson Birckenstock obviouslly makes a better sandal. Although for the bargain Betula comes in @ a distance 2Nd.If you,ve worn Berks before don't compromise quality for quantity."
2,Fulci-lite,"This is one of Fulci's weaker films. Alas, by the late 1980's Lucio was relegated to making Italian tv movies and those so-called production values show."
4,MUNGO JERRY DID RELEASE 'PUSHBIKE SONG',"I've got it on another CD (not listed here on Amazon). The Push Bike Song was originally an Australian Top 40 song by The Mixtures. It was intentionally an imitative salute to Mungo Jerry's ""In The Summertime"" that Mungo Jerry later honored with his own cover of ""The Push Bike Song"", which recieved limited airplay in the U.S. around 1974-75.Most people in the U.S. are unaware that there was a Jugband revival of sorts in Australia in the early 70's."
1,What adult is this tiny?,"Bought one of these shirts for a group photo, and as a gift to my sister- also bought two for my husband and I, and my daughter. Those ones were the right size. This one...good lord. One of their workers must be losing his vision. It looks like a youth size Medium, not an Adult medium. I don't know what to do with this stupid shirt, it's too big for my daughter, too small for even my small husband and I. So dissapointed. I sent them a picture of the label, which clearly says Adult medium, and then a picture for reference to it's size. That's an Adult size medium, Fruit of the Loom next to it. You can see that the kitten shirt is only half the size, tops. How did nobody notice this? Especially for a package as important as two-day shipping?I want a new shirt. I shouldn't have to pay return shipping, and now have to ship it overnight, because my sister is here tomorrow. This is ridiculous."
1,Beautiful. Granddaughter loved it.,20 more words required. 20 more words required. 20 more words required. 20 more words required. 20 more words required.You/ve got to be kidding! 4 words above should have been enough.
3,What is a tee t-shirt? Shouldn't it be Kit-tee shirt?,"I love the shirt, although I'm sure my cats would be very angry if I wore one. I don't know what a tee t-shirt is, however. Until I do, I don't want to take any chances and buy one."
4,"Nice shirt, fun shirt","The sizes tend to run a little small,but other than that,they're pretty nice shirts.That's really all I've got."
5,Good practical book to learn SQL on iSeries,This book was just what I needed. I'm an RPG programmer who has to learn SQL for a new application we're developing. Found most of what I needed here.
5,Impressive technical depth,"I'm an AS/400 programmer with over ten years experience with RPG, DDS, and DB2/400. I've been working with SQL/400 for a little over a year. I wish I'd had this book when I started learning SQL! It has very thorough introductions to all the essential DDL and DML statements. Although I'm somewhat beyond the ""basics"" level now, I've also found lots of help with more advanced issues.The explanation of transaction isolation levels and record locking is better than I've found anywhere. Also, the complex rules for ""system"" vs. ""SQL"" naming are finally comprehensible. The authors seem to know SQL/400 very well, judging from the numerous ""nitty-gritty"" technical fine points that are provided in footnotes.This is really the kind of book that an AS/400 developer needs to become a good SQL programmer, too."

5,Farberware 15 piece cookware set,I really wanted All-Clad but there's no way I can justify spending that much for pots and pans. Besides they are heavy and I have carpal tunnel syndrome. I have had Farberware for the past 27 years and they served me well but were finally showing their wear. I decided to get Farberware again figuring another 27 years would be great. I like the new Farberware. They have a nice thick bottom and just look great. They are also not too heavy. I have not regretted the purchase one bit. In fact I love them. the only thing is that you cannot use any of the lids from the old set.
2,Things just aren't what they used to be,"My family has used Farberware pots for generations - my grandmother would purchase a set for every bride to be. My mother's 30 year old set still looks great. However, the new Farberware no longer has the quality of days gone by. I followed directions exactly and still, from the 1st use of each pot, the (inside) bottoms discolored & have tiny pit marks. The outside of the pots gleam providing you dry them well immediately after washing. I'm sorry to say I won't be buying or recommending Farberware Classic again."
5,Farberware Pots and Pans Rock,"Farberware is always great! We are very happy with it. This is our second set (We got a similar set 10 years ago, which is still in great condition, but this one came with pieces the other doesn't have, so we got it!) They last, the handles don't get hot, they are easy to clean, and not too heavy. An awesome buy!"
1,FARBERWARE STOCK POT,"I'M NOT TO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT SOMEONE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. THE STANLESS STEEL IS ERODING IN THE POT ON THE BOLTS HOLDING THE HANDLES. I DON'T WANT TO USE IT, BECAUSE I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING TO GO IN MY FOOD"
4,Good pans,"I have most of these pans and would not consider giving them up for any other I have seen to date. I do not, however, trust the handles to oven use and I like to have a stock pot that I can use as a dutch oven in a pinch. If the handles were stated to be made of Bakelite material I would add these to my current set in a heartbeat."
4,Good Value,"good price for good set, about $50.00 less than in store. I would buy again, for the average household use"
4,Farberware cookware,"The cookware is as described, however it was delivered in its original packaging and so the surprise Christmas gift was not a surprise. It was so disappointing."
2,"Discoloring, dusting, sticking, definitely disappointing. Sept. 2012","I bought Farberware 50049 Classic Stainless Steel 15-Piece Cookware Set September 2012. Within 2 times in the dishwasher (description says the set is dishwasher safe!) the exterior of the skillets became discolored and are ""dusting"". That is, there is a dark gray powder like residue on the outsides of the pans each time I wash. I don't know if this is oxidization but it's a problem. It's filthy and I have completely lost confidence in the skillets. Also I have noticed a discoloration in the form of spotting or mottling inside at the bottoms of the sauce pans and they are not nearly as nonstick as my original set of Farberware Cookware I bought some 20 years ago. In fact food sticks to them almost as much as it does my 20yr old set. I have had them just short of 30 days so will be returning the entire set."
5,One of the best,The game has great gameplay and I just loved it.( even better when you get a code to play the with the boss). Great Game. and easy combo's to make! You have all the good Characters from bith street fighter and marvel comics. about 3 hyper combos for each person too. I loved this game.
5,At least it's not as painfull to watch such as Hangover 2,The movie was not as bad as I thought it would be. The part where he auditioned for the mac & cheese commercial was hilarious.
2,What?,"How is this getting decent reviews? I like dumb comedies including most of Adam Sandler's movies, but this one was dumb without being funny. Nick Swardson is a regular in Adam's movies and he is a funny guy. Aside from Kevin Nealon(another Sandler regular) who was funny as hell, this movie just didn't work for me."
2,Wasn't a trainwreck but lame.,"I had been interested in seeing this from hearing all the bad reviews. I'm pretty open to comedy so going in I got past the buck teeth and hair. It's part of the joke, I get it. The problem was the story, it was just flat. I honestly was able to tell what was going to happen five minutes before it happened as it became cliched. The loser becomes a hero. There was no real original level of comedy here. I don't give it a 0 star like many had. But I can't give it a positive as the writers didn't come up with anything fresh as far as the jokes go. You pretty much see the movie in the trailer."
3,If you are a Don Johnson fan,"This was a weird movie and the production cost 10 million.It was also from Adam Sandler's production.So for those who are tired of his ridiculous films like Jack and Jill,I completely understand.The lead actor is Bucky who is played by Sandler's protege Nick Swardson.He really is unfunny and cannot carry a movie even if his life depended on it.His best role was probably in Don't Mess with the Zohan.This movie is kinda like Joe Dirt but with an R rating.The best roles come from washed up actors like Don Johnson,Stephen Dorf,Kevin Nealon,Nicholas Turturro.They carry the movie with their lines.Christina Ricci is the lead actress and she plays a happy low self esteem girl.Worth watching if you watch movies with Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.There is nudity from female adult pornstars as well.Ido Mosseri from You don't mess with the Zohan stars as well as a producer.Very funny performance from himThe movie bombed at the box office and has an extremely low rating at IMDB."
1,Cooking in plastic!,"I bought one of these a few months back (though mine has the all metal lid (preferable). It is well designed and attractive. But it has a MAJOR flaw: the egg cups are black plastic with a thermo-conductivity that must be close to zero. Aside from the totally unacceptable aspect of cooking in plastic (!), it took me 9 minutes (elevation 7300 ft.) to poach an egg to medium yolk and firm white, when an all-metal poacher would take maybe 5 or 6 minutes max. Avoid this one!"
4,Simple to use. Clunky software,"The cable does what it is supposed to do. It is easy to attach to the dive computer. The software itself, which you download from the Oceanic site or install from the DC's supplied cd, is very clunky and not intuitive but eventually one gets the grip of it."
1,omg!,"why on earth is this so expensive. i've had my i-Zone camera since it first came out and the film never was this expensive back in the day. wow. i wanted to buy the film so my daughter can play with it, but forget it now. not worth the money. :("
1,The product is expired and isn't any good.,I can't believe they would even sell something that is expired and isn't any good. Please do not purchase this film.
2,Great idea if done correctly,"Apparently there is i-Zone sticky film and there is i-Zone 200 sticky film - and the two cameras are TOTALLY different and don't work together - even though the film fits the camera. And, even after you trim the picture, there is still a border of gold colored paper that looks wrong. But cute little pictures."
4,The Non-Sticky Film is Better,"I'm an i-Zone addict. I own three different i-Zone cameras and have taken literally hundreds of i-Zone pictures. But while I'm a big fan of the convenience, size and fun associated with them, I'm not thrilled with the price of the sticky film.The average price for a 3-pack (which is more economical than the 12-exposure single pack), depends on where you purchase your film and if it's on sale. Typically, the 3-pack will run more. But this price tends to go higher for the sticky film, which I don't think is worth the extra cost. And if you use your i-Zone camera as much as me, then the added cost will really multiply quickly.The main difference between the two kinds of films is that the sticky film displays a tacky-colored border around it and includes an adhesive-backing, which isn't all that strong. I agree with one of the previous reviewers to save the extra money and manually use tape with the regular 3-pack film."
2,Not for young children,"Each of my three children have a different version of the I-Zone Camera (Barbie, Radio and regular). On top of the film being very, very expensive, hard to find in discount stores or electronic stores and if dropped the film pops out...almost half of the film cartridage gets wasted. With on pull of a picture, multiple exposures will get pulled out. Or several pics turn out black. I don't recommed these cameras for young children as it takes an older person, 12+, to operate successfully."
5,Love this book!,"I read Jim Peyton's book, because my friend, Irene Corey was his friend. She highly recommended it to me and her quality sense is impeccable.I didn't expect, however, to love it as much as she did. I could not put this book down.It is beautifully written..sometimes 'hold yourself' funny.....sometimes the tears just surprise you.Peyton is a Kentucky guy who is down-home enough to write true; and brilliant enough to see a Universal picture. I was sad to finish it.But it stays in the easy to find shelf for another read."
2,She sounds like she's trying hard to imitate Mariah CArey.,I saw her perform live in a concert and she really has no talent. It shows on her album. Her weak voice was masked by a lot of background instrumentation. Please don't buy this.
1,there is an earlier book,"I see this book won an award in the 1970s and assume it was printed then.I was born in 1940 and had a book on the rainbow serpent when a child - and it was not a new book; all my siblings were born before me.It was hard backed - from memory and in old measurements, it was about 15 inches or more high and about 7 or 8 or more inches wide. It had the most stunning illustrations, particularly the end pages. I can still see the serpent in my minds eye.The story was aboriginal and I assume the one which is repeated in the book listed on amazon.Does anyone know if the book I remember exists today?CarbenThe Rainbow Serpent"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"An illustrated retelling of the aboriginal myth of the Rainbow Serpent. A very nice, suitable style and palette of color is used, as well. A very interesting story and an easy introduction to some aboriginal mythology, especially for younger readers. Quite well done, indeed."
2,Awful stats textbook,"I hated this book, and I only bought it because it was required for my homework assignments. If you choose not to go to class or need the text for extra help with concepts and equations, well, you're in trouble. There are a lot of Greek symbols and theoretical equations, but few practical examples that would help you learn to solve problems. I had the author for my professor, and his lectures were totally different from how things are presented in the text (and much more informative and useful). If you don't absolutely NEED the book for homework problems, I would recommend not buying it and simply attending lecture."
1,Horrible!,I never got my book. I need it for school and I haven't heard back from the seller yet. It is ridiculous the amount of shipping time needed for this book and the fact that it didn't come on time is even more ridiculous.
1,horrible to use,I bought this item to make baby food. I had recalled the old fashoned ones we used when i was a kid to make apple sauce. Well this is a poor design to say the least. it assembles verry easily but it is not stable at all on the pan.from the pint of the handle crank to where it sits on the bowl/pan is to far and when you crank it it tends to wobble and is not steady at all.
5,Terrific Update!,"The writer and artist made a super update on the character and origin. The streamined art was perfect for the story... capturing a bit of old-fashionedness and nostalgia without looking campy and/or dated. Excellent correographed action, the storyline got confusing visually rarely. Barbara Gordan has spunk and in the would of Powerpuff Girls and realistic female heroes they showed her strong, compassionate, smart, and funny without dumbing her down. Brought some of the ""modern sensibilities"" of the current female characters to an origin story. Best mini-series of 2003."
5,Lives up to the hype!,"This story is every bit as good as you have heard. Barbara/Batgirl has a very unique ""voice"" and the art has a beautiful, cinematic quality.The villains are also very well crafted in that we see the real conflict and motivation behind their actions, which makes them both humorous and scary at the same time.It would be great to see a follow-up series as long as they were able to re-assemble the same creative team from this book."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A look at Batgirl's early screwups, and her motivations, well before the Joker blew out her spine. Barbara Bordon is a fun loving, bad guy arse kicking, black leather clad redhead brilliant bombshell. She revels in the fact, and has a lot of fun in the process, as you can see in this book."
1,How Sad,"If you think you can learn anything valuable from a person who believes they were once a Yetti (Big Foot) in a previous life, who communicates with faeires, and can control the elements, then spend your money. You won't be disappointed. This woman is totally off her rocker. She believes she communicated with a horse with an evil spirit, the spirit left the horse after she spoke with it, and then caused planetary changes and the demise of Communism. HUH? The woman is totally out of touch with nature, her spiritual side, and most importantly herself. Go back to the basics Penelope. Learn to love the animals again for who they are. Do not impose on them your own distorted beliefs."
2,Big and clunky,This was heavy on my wrist and just too clunky. If you like chunky clunky (and many do) this would be a nice choice for you.
3,order of tracks,"My only complaint about downloading this product versus ordering the cd by mail is the order of the music. When it is downloaded to the computer, each track comes in in order of number. When it is a two disc set, the order becomes 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc... This is not the order of the opera!! In order to fix this, when listening, I have to then make a new playlist for each cd as it is intended. This has happened with other cd sets I have purchased it this way on Amazon. I will likely not do it again."
2,They don't make 'em like they used to.,"I bought this guitar to replace one of the same make & model that was stolen from me. The initial one I owned was really nice--high-quality, tight craftsmanship. I considered myself a fan of this brand.But the one I just got in the mail was a bit of a rattle-trap. The bolts around the tuning keys were loose, and some screws were loose, and it buzzed a lot when the strings were plucked. I spent a lot of time unscrewing things, and sealing the gaps in the hardware, and re-stringing and testing, before I got the guitar playing well.I think Luna must have changed some of their parts, or some of their factory processes, in the time they've been manufacturing this guitar. That's the only way I can account for the newer one being lower quality."
3,Unamused,I ordered this but the one I received was black. I should have known you can't find a good-looking white HDMI cable these days.
5,Belken hdmi cable,It's a very heavy duty cable seems to do what it's suppose to. I have a very good HD picture.
1,"Appears to be good quality, but doesn't work.","I recently bought a Blu-Ray player and needed an HDMI cable for it. I got this in today, and the TV couldn't pick up the signal. I tried different ports, same problem. So, I switched the HDMI cable from my DVR/TV box to the Blu-Ray player to make sure it wasn't the player - nope, that works fine. The cable is defective and 100% doesn't work at all. It appears to have solid build quality and doesn't appear to have any damage; but that doesn't matter if it doesn't even work."
1,Awful Film,"""Impact Point"" features bad acting, bad direction and has only one redeeming quality: Melissa Keller. She is gorgeous, nude and clothed."
1,Low Impact point.,"The cover of the film says it all. Whereas most semi-decent movies have covers which facus on the faces of the stars involved, this one has a different anatomical feature front and centre.And what a load of twaddle the content is. An asinine plot with more holes than swiss cheese, clearly where dialogue plays second fiddle to body language, heavy going to set up the plot, it is almost painful to endure.If one defines escapist as being able to escape reality then this plot is fantastic. No, seriously, this movie has no credibility whatsoever.By the end, I was laughing hysterically.Not for serious consideration."
2,eye candy,"sort of like Into the Blue. Basically, visual eye candy, the promotion of volleyball, and the beach. Plot is cheesy, motive is not strong, and bad chemistry. Watching without sound would make no difference."
2,yikes,"i actually got this dvd because ive been a brian austin green fan since i was a kid - unfortunately, i was not a fan of this movie...i did like the plot twist near the end though"
3,"A reasonable, but not outstanding, 2 CD set of Bach","This is a good, but certainly not great, set of performances of two of Bach's contrapunctal works. Why only three stars? Well, it is a bargin, and there is nothing glaringly wrong, but there are just better recordings of both of these works available. If you are really on a very tight budget, you might buy it, but if you are really into Bach or want to learn, skip this and spend a bit more money.In fact, if you look around you can get better recordings on the cheap. For the Musical Offering try Leonhardt and for the Art of the Fugue there are numerous better sets, for instance the Gould keyboard recording, or the Jordi Savall peformance that includes both of the works."
2,Made Where,"Cute mugs. Nice size. Not made in England as Royal Worcester is made.Had several stickers on it saying, ""Made in China"". FYI"
2,Worst PPV of 2000,"Except for the main event this is just an all around crappy PPV. The Sting vs. Demon match is terrible as are the tag matches. The ladder match is great. The 3 way to be #1 contender is boring and has a dumb ending. The US title match would have been great if Mike Awesome would have gotten the win, but Vince Russo decided to make it a comedy match. Jarrett's match is great as always, but he should've won. Vince Russo's worst PPV EVER!!"
2,Trust me on this one...,"When the WCW came to town,I thought that it was going to be a good show...I was wrong.This ppv is probably the worst ppv you will ever see in your life. The only acceptable matches was the triple threat ladder match and the Lance Storm/Mike Awesome match...although awesome's character was embarassing.The worst thing about this ppv? Goldberg refusing to job his match and seeing a ref shoving a couple of packets of green mist into the Great Muta's mouth. Save your money and buy some ECW tapes or Wrestlemania X-7."
4,like it,"i like the look, but close up it does appear to be exactly what you paid for. Mine is high on a wall surrounded by other items- so it is fine. The pendulum look is supported by a couple of plastic supports, mine was broken, but with some good ole Yankee ingenuity...it's working fine."
4,Farberware Classic 4-Quart Double Deep Frypan,"Unbelievable low price for Farberware! As with all Farberware solid construction, easy to clean and a joy to cook with. This is a great addition to my kitchen."
4,Worth the price,I've only had this skillet about a week but I love it.It is heavy and durable and clean up is a breeze.I plan to order one for my daughter.
2,I'm too experienced for this book.,"I am 41 years old and have read many books like this one before. I found that it said little while being very erudite. If I was younger I would probably be a bit wowed and perhaps confused by it. Maybe if I was in my 20s I would have found it a better read. At my level of development, I learned little I didn't already know and found little content."
5,Gift idea Galore...,"I have a couple of the single sets, but gave several of these to office personnel at Christmas and I am the savior of my department. So many of us have stress issues and sleep problems as a result. I have used these for years and my eyes look so much brighter from the sounder sleep."
4,Fun for all,We are not seasoned play station junkies..yet. But the kids are having lots of fun in competition and/or playing solo.
4,Great Price and a lot of fun!,My son wanted this for his birthday. We looked at all the local retail stores and it was $40.00 or more. He found in on amazon for less than $10.00. He and his 2 brothers play it all the time. I will look at amazon before buying anywhere else.
4,Too much hype!,"This game routinely gets the highest ranking possible for PS2 games...and I have no idea why. You drive courses, do some tricks, and get into a career mode of racing. Big deal? I guess I should try some crappy games to compare, but this game is just OK with me."
4,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,This is the best game ever...Except for using the Motobikes.You can't land just about anything when your it. But everything else is awsome.Price is also fantastic for a kinda new game.
2,From Back Cover,"Jeeves Never Looked This Good...Freddi Elliot needs a job, fast. And she's willing to take anything - even a job as some old coot's butler. Only, little does Freddi know that this assignment will test not only her domestic skills, but also her libido. Because her new boss is stubborn, obnoxious... and utterly irresistable.Jack Carlisle has only a few weeks to learn some manners. Otherwise, he can kiss the cash from his uncle for a new business venture goodbye. Jack doesn't have a clue how to begin, but hopes his new butler can offer a few suggestions. What he doesn't expect is to be the one doing all the suggesting. And his first recommendation is to get Freddi out of those stuffy clothes and into his bed..."
2,Don't buy this one,"We thought we were ordering a clear flashlight but ended up getting yellow ones. I ordered several, and the first one I unpacked we could not get to work at all. Even though they are advertised as lasting forever and never having a problem. They did send more than we ordered, maybe because they knew some of them wouldn't work?"
2,not impressed,the product doesn't hold it's flash too long. and would need a constant at least one minute prep before finally obtaining light. in order to get maximum light one must shake for almost 2 minutes constantly. that is a little too much of a hassle for the mediocre light produced by this product. i would not recommend this product based on my experience
2,A disappointment,"When I found out that this book won the Christy Award, I couldn't wait to read it. What a disappointment! There was so much symbolism that it was a hard book to read. It started off sloooow and didn't pick up pace as the book went on. For days on end I didn't pick up the book, and I didn't miss it."
2,A Snoozer,"This is one tedious read. The pace is slow, and I care nothing at all about these characters or what happens to them. I'm about two-thirds the way through with no desire to keep going."
1,Too sloooow!,"I've been looking for good suspenseful Christian fiction to devour recently, having completed Joel Rosenburg's thrillers, and many Whitlow and Peretti books. I usually jump into a book, and before long, am unable to put it down - most last 2-5 days before I complete them. When I picked up this book, it looked quite interesting, so I decided to read it. While on vacation, I read 100 pages (over a couple of weeks), and never had any difficulty putting it down, except finding a logical stopping point. I had more difficulty getting myself to pick it up and read it. There was nothing to ""hook"" me. Finally, I decided to cut my losses at 100 pages and find another book."
4,easy to use,"Got this book for a class. It's easy to use, includes different variations of signs that might be used. As with any sign book though, you have to try to figure out what the sign will look like in action from a drawing."
5,the best,"This is the most inpired, deepest, and most beautiful playing of the Beethoven cello/piano sonatas I have been able to find. A review below mine states that Rostropovich and Richter's interpretations are too ""static and humourless""; this review is wrong. Very few musicians have poured as much feeling into their work as did Richter and Rostropovich. Rostropovich once explained: ""We were left with nothing but music [in Communist Russia]. It was a bright spot, a ray of life. It was our air to breathe."" As a result, nothing on the Richter/Rostropovich tracks of these disks has even a hint of the mechanical and the intensity of these performances is unparalleled. I believe quite strongly that in these recordings is exactly what Beethoven had wanted."
5,Sublime,"There is really not much I can add to the reviews below, but I wanted to put in my two cents anyway, if only to increase the count of 5-star reviews for this work. Whenever my wife and I listen to these CDs, we ask ourselves how these sonatas for cello can be so overlooked by supposed Beethoven experts. Definitely among the most underrated pieces by Beethoven. The scherzo from the A Major sonata is something words cannot really describe (and so is the entire sonata). But then I realize it is probably 50% Beethoven + 50% Rostropovich and Richter. We have watched Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline Du Pre play this same sonata on a tape from the old Granada TV series and, even though they are absolutely great, their performance does not touch this one. I think this is a can't-miss buy for any lover of classical music."
1,HISSING SOUND,"To The Amazon Team:When I ordered the label was Philips (as on the Amazon website)The CD received was from DECCA Label (Please update the images atleast, ""Any label can be good"")THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK TO CONTACT AMAZON (no toll-free numbers on the screen, no e-mail tabs!!!!!!!)HoweverThere is significant Hissing Noise (That means I have opened the packet)Like always, Music is Great, please preserve it4 Blank Stars for free Hissing Noise and parameters supporting the same, 1 Star for the fact that it was atleast the same CD""Music cannot be rated"""
2,Richter is a genius; Rostropovich not in the same league,"I bought this CD on the strength my opinion of Richter's collection of Bach piano music, and was not disappointed upon hearing his playing here either. However, as my wife said when I first played it, ""Who's the cellist? It sounds like my brother learning to play the violin."" Her brother, by the way, became a drummer and then an economist. I don't know enough to tell if this is typical Rostropovich, but his sound on this CD is scraping and harsh. I ended up giving it to a reseller. I recommend Fournier as a greater XX century cellist."
2,Rubbish,Waste of time 1940's war film that should be rate PG-13 only reason I give it a two star is quality of the print.
1,"true garbage, unplayable disk, freeze,freeze,freeze","terrible, never would play, just 2 or 3 seconds and freeze. unwatchable. watch out for go hastings in texas."
4,Good read,"This was my first Chyittenden novel.If you haven't already read the summary, Snap Shot is about Diana Gordon, who gets injured one too many times on the job as PI and decides to make her photography hobby full-time. She meets handsome chiropracter Conner Callahan - a widow at 40 - in her new town, small Port Findlay, Washington.A murder shakes up the town and, in true romantic suspense style, throws a reluctant Diana and Connor together.I liked this book overall. There were times when I felt Diana's character - particularly her background - needed more development. There were also times when the authors summed up emotions or dialogue too quickly and I found myself wanting more. The axiom ""show don't tell"" comes to mind.Still, Snap Shot was well-written and worth the read. I plan to follow up on this author to see her evolution as a writer."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"Bobby Brown has always seemed a bit poppy for my liking but this cd is a compilation of his best stuff and it goes off! It's not too heavy but still rocks with solid beats like Don't Be Cruel and My Prerogative. It has too its playful songs like Every Little Step. A good mix of pop and rnb, I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to just have a good groove with a good vibe."
1,bobby just left the hospital the end is coming,the long drug addicted saga of bobby brown is finally coming to the end we all crave anyway if you're his fans you can cop this and reminisce about how good he was back in 88-89 only liked about 2 of his songs in his cracked out career well anyway farewell bobby we'll rememberr the drug busts and the arrests and the long rehab stints burn in hell and don't worry whit will be right behind you and I pray bobbi christina never gets hooked on crack me and ny crew will serve her right.
5,Alfred Brendel playing Mozart...,Like anything that I have to say is going to clarify the obvious. Brendel is one of the best when it comes to Mozart so there is no fear in purchasing this collection because his performances are guaranteed to be perfect. And it's a great price too.
4,Almost Perfect,If you love Mozart you will really enjoy this CD. In my opinion Sir Neville Marriner & the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields performs Mozart better than any other. The only problem I have with this CD is some tracks on the first CD are recorded live. I have never been a big fan of live recordings. An occasional cough is heard on track 4 which makes me cringe. If only they passed out cough drops that evening I would have awarded this CD five stars. Otherwise the music is simply sublime. Robitussin anyone?
5,"Accurate, factual, easy to read","Since I was born a muslim myself and am very familiar with the teachings and I have read most of the Quran, I found this book to be a very factual and easy to read. Anyone who wants to learn about Islam with an accurate and unbiased view and easy to read I highly recommend this book"
4,An essential guide to Islam in these troubled times,"This is an essential guide to what Muslims REALLY believe, which we all ought to read in these troubled times. So why 4 stars? Well, I think Esposito is a little too rosy about what Thomas Friedmann, in his brilliant NY Times columns, calls the ""Arab basement"". Most Muslims are sane, normal, good neighbours - our kind of people! But, alas, there are some real crazies out there who believe they are truly Muslims - and have lots of Saudi money to back their vile version of the Islamic faith. May the moderates prosper! I hope Esposito is right - I fear he may not be. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
2,"Not good enough, or objective for that matter","This book is one of the most patronising books I've ever read. If you want a quick, easy to read and extremely basic introduction to Islam this is the book for you. But if you want in depth information, analysis and objectivity you should not buy this book. For example, L'Eposito goes writes that the Six Day War was more like a 6 hour war, the man may know about religion but he sure doesn't know about Middle East history.If you really want to learn about Islam, Karen Armstrong and Bernard Lewis are far better authors than this man, and have more objective books."
1,Unbelieveable,"Rarely do I ever give any book less then 5 stars because I think it such a waste of time. The exception here is that I have been there, I have seen the way women are treated, the hate, the murder, honor killing of teenages, beating a wife for not wanting sex. As a woman I was shocked by the stoneage methods women are treated, Islam for me is nothing more then a religion of hate, murder, crimes against women, what every woman needs to know about Islam is that you have no rights, there is no sugar coating here. I have seen this religion in play first hand, since 1991 to 2010, themurder continue, the hate crimes continue, for western women it is a step back in time. For me, what you need to know is that unless the book tells you about the murder and hate crimes then its not telling the whole truth."
1,Scholarly Credibility in Question,"John Esposito is a life-long ""scholar"" of Islam and he was totally surprised by September 11, 2003. The man had no clue that militant Islamic terrorists would do exactly what the same militant Islamic terrorists had publicly announced they would do: kill. Prior to September 11, 2003 Esposito argued that those who were alarmed by acts of Islamic terror were ""ill-informed"" ""over-reacting"" and responding to a ""culturally limited definition of democracy."" How does this guy keep his job?In any event, he fails to mention in this book. as he always fails to mention, a passage in the Hadith known to every Muslim on the planet which states that ""women are deficient in intellect."" This is supposed to be a quote from Mohammed contained in what is regarded as the most reliable compendium of sayings of Mohammed, the Bukhari Hadith. Islam ""honors"" women by declaring them stupid, make no mistake about it.Esposito is at best deluded and at worst, disingenuous."
1,Waste of Money,"Wow, what a disappointment! We got this because my 6 year old is a zoo nut. We have many other animal/zoo videos and all are VASTLY superior. This dvd looks like some pilot intros to segments of Zoo videos that were never completed. I think there are four, that last about 2 minutes a piece and that's it. We're sending it back, I wouldn't have the heart to sell it on Ebay! Don't waste your money!"
2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah...","World Book 11 is very good if you are interested in new equipment. If you are looking for some fleshing out of the North American environment, it's not bad. If you want to know about the details of the ""Campaign for Unity"", you'll be disappointed.Asides from a short rundown of those potentially involved, there just isn't much about this long awaited war. No estimate of the total number of units involved, their composition or their locations are given, no dates are provided. No real idea of the paths that the Coalition will use to advance are mapped out. None of the ""special defences"" that we've heard about, prepared by those in the Coalition's path, are discussed.Palladium took the approach with this book that the GM will detail everything but the new equipment, OCC's, etc..."
4,The darker side of magic realism.,"I would not know where to begin to try to summarize this book. There are several story arcs, and several narrative voices which are actually all one voice-- different guises of Humberto Peñaloza. He is an unborn fetus (miracle baby), a frustrated nun, an improbable mute, and the secretary to a rich man who may or may not have fathered the rich man's deformed baby.The Obscene Bird of Night is justly considered one of the best books in Chilean literature. Richly and skilfully written, its myth and metaphor wraps around itself to be moving, horrifying, mystifying and satisfying.This is a book that needs some time. It is very far from an easy read. If I have not given it five stars, it is not a comment on the genius of the book. Rather, it is simply that it is more grotesque than I really have the stomach to enjoy in an unqualified way. I admire it immensely, and recommend it unhesitatingly."
5,Beyond times,"This is one of the best latinamerican books, further than magic realismus (realismo mágico) this novel traspasses all the borders beyond time, gender, reality and absurd. Dark novel that takes you into your own clue du sac. This wonderful story narrated by a mute man, who becomes all the voices in the novel, is like a monad of humanity, himself represents all the human disgraces, inherited from generation to generation and unable to scape fate. Must not be missed if you want to take a deep immersion into human condition."
4,The Road to Recovery,"This show was certainly better than most of the WCW PPV's.Kanyon and Mike Awesome had the best match of the night.Coming in second would be the Three Tier cage match with Jarrett and DDP(Kanyon does a Mick Foley bump off the top).Even Hogan had a better than average match and worked pretty well with Kidman.Douglas and Flair wasn't exactly a classic but it did give all the ""smart"" fans a long awaited match.Overall a definate improvement in the quality of the matches and I'd recommend it if it wasn't for that ridiculous price."
4,WCW Slamboree 2000 Review,The only thing I didn't like about the video is the lame david guy. He should have never been in that 3 way cage match with DDP & Jeff Jarrett at all. Eventhoght I like his theme song. The match itself and the rest were ok. I give PPV a 8 out of 10.
5,lots of photos!,"This book has the most complete collection of photos by and about L.M. Montgomery. It also contains text that explains each photo and has many interesting articles about Maud through the various stages of her life from beginning to end. There are also sections dedicated to film and other renderings of Anne, Emily, etc. This is a must-have for those interested in Anne of Green Gables or her creator.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
2,no delivery,"I did not recieve this item, although i bought and paid for it, but i am still waiting for the logical explanation or refund."
5,A real page turner!,"I did not want this book to end. I love the way this book was written from Sarah's point of view. Sarah was depicted so vividly - a great character any woman could relate to. Sarah's situation although unique was very enticing and fun to read about. The author kept me wanting to know what she was going to do next. The love scenes were hot, hot, hot! I liked it because it had a surprise ending - not the traditional happily ever after. This is a book you would be foolish to miss!"
2,Not a great read,"I don't usually give less than 3 stars to a book, but this novel was poorly written, the characters weren't well developed, there were too many unnecessary sex scenes (if I wanted a romance novel I'd get one) and finally the main character is not likeable. I could not muster any sympathy for the protagonist because she made poor choices for herself time and time again throughout the book. BYPASS this chick lit read and buy something like the book 'You Have to Kiss a lot of Frogs' or 'Slightly Single'. Those novels will quench your thirst for a good read. 'Last Year of Being Single' will not."
2,"couldnt get into it, nothing was happening, got through 1/2 of the book","Nothing was going on. It was just a girl rambling on about how she did but didnt want to be with her boyfriend and wanting to be with another man. Nothing was going on, and I got half through the book."
1,Mindless Drivel,"I don't know how this book ended up being published... I dislike this book to such an extent that I am writing a review, warning anyone thinking about buying this book to step away from the ""add to cart"" button. A three year old could write something more coherent and interesting... The sentences travel in more circles than the vultures over this authors career..."
2,I hate rating so low as I love marineland eclipes systems but ...,"I bought this corner to go with my hex and 12 by marineland but am going to try to get in touch with marineland as petsmart won't even let me return it after being used??? First .. you have to open the entire top to feed, clean, etc and it really needs a feed door like the hex so you can leave it open some to let the stinky gases out. There is no ventalation .. but filtration is great .. looks are great .. but I would say a design flaw as I tried to keep my Betta in it and had to keep something jammed in the lid area so he could get air!! Then I have only had one guppie in it for 1 day and it stinks in there when you open the top... great looking .. could use a little feed door for gases to excape."
1,Brand new and didn't work,"I bought this last evening (purchased and set up on Sunday, April 31) Set it up and transferred water from another tank. The filter assembly module started to work but then konked out. It's now dead. So I had to transfer water, plants, and shrimp back to the original tank. I've not even had the time to register the warranty. My first impression is not positive. I'll see how the company backs their products today.Addendum: I tried reaching the tech desk for help with the filter module. I have sent 2 messages; neither have been returned. So you can decide if there is good customer service or nor (My vote is NO!) Also having the same scratch problem as the other poster.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one!"
3,Stand Case,"The TSA locks on this case are super cheap and I already broke two keys, but luckily the manufacturer sent me a bunch of copies after I contacted them. I fill this bad boy up and it is pretty much too heavy to carry and push the wheels around from gig to gig for video production and photography shoots, so I highly recommend that you use a cart to transport this around."
1,Not a good product,"This product is very expensive for what it is, but if it would that would be fine - I guess. But it did not work. It did not stay stuck to the refrigerator once it was holding the light switch down."
3,review,"Unfortunately this won't sit on my gas burners. Not a big deal though as I'll just use it in/as a double boiler. Still, something to consider..."
5,Petite Perfection,"I love this little butter warmer. Of course, it also warms milk, sauce, syrups, etc. quite nicely. It sits on the burner very firmly, and this little pan feels substantial for being a little over 1/2 quart in size. The bottom of the pan is solid and transmits heat quickly and evenly. Also, the lip on the rim spills not one unintended drop! I am very pleased with the quality and design of this cute little baby."
5,Great product!,"Thrilled with this product. It is so hard to find a sauce pan in these dimensions- perfect for heating your coffee's milk on the stove or melting butter. I bought a similar one years ago and have been looking for another, - the other one I have is a little taller and smaller at the base- which is better for frothing milk- but I haven't found another stovetop model. This is classic Farberware with a solid, heavy bottom, a really lovely little saucepan- I""m considering getting another. Great little pan."
5,"Inexpensive, yet high quality","This little butter warmer is GREAT for melting not only butter, but cheese or chocolate as well. Its small size makes it perfect for heating up single servings."
4,Butter warmer,This was just what I wanted. I needed a small saucepan for heating up leftover veggies or just small portions of a larger casserole. Very pleased with my purchase.
2,Burns,"The pot is adorable, but burns easily. I should have bought a shorter wider butter warmer with a thicker base."
4,"Looks great, but...","I have many pieces of Farberware cookware that have served me long and well and still look and work great. I have wanted one of these for a long time. This one fills the parameters I want very well...except for the fact that the pour spout is on the wrong side. I am left-handed, and it is very awkward for me to use one designed like this. I have seen some with spouts on both sides, but they are not as nice as this one. I guess I will have to keep waiting and looking, unless Farberware changes their design soon."
4,Must Have if you are looking for used parts,Easy to use guide. Lots of parts listed though a lot of the interchangable items are common knowledge for people who are familiar with Chevys.
1,Offensive and insulting,"It is hard to tell what is truth and what is fiction in this book. In its attempt to be lighthearted and amusing, more often the tone appeared to be mocking the Catholic Church. If I were trying to learn about the lives of those holy men and women whose examples we try to copy in our walk with Jesus - well, I most definitely would not use this book or let anyone I knew read it."
2,Book is Not for me,"There are many interesting facts in this book but you might not want your children reading it because it tries to be entertaining by taking numerous negative jabs at the saints. This book frequently ridicules some small components of a saint's life. The book frequently uses sexual humor. Virgin martyrs are slightly mocked for being virgins. Page 171 introduces a chapter about the Blessed Virgin Mary with the title ""You've Tried the Rest, Now Here's the Best"". Page 174 treats the Immaculate Conception as only a legend and suggests this is how his own daughter came to be (see inside back cover)."
4,Better than others of its type,"I liked this book better than The Everything Lives of the Saints. The ""Everything"" series contained a lot of fabrication presented as fact.This book includes a lot of legend, that's true, but the acknowledges in the book that there's no real way to separate what is fact and what is fiction. Even though a lot is mired in legend of a millenia or more, I found this book very accessible and enjoyable to read."
4,"Okay, with a Couple Gems","For Rimsky-Korsakov suites, I think there's no better place to go than the Chandos set featuring Neeme Jarvi and the Scottish National Orchestra. That album has four of the five selections on this release conducted by David Zinman. That leaves Sadko, Antar, Capriccio espagnol and the Russian Easter Festrival Overture. The first two of those are performed here in a reasonably fine manner. At least one reviewer has severely criticized the performance of Antar in this set, and while it isn't the best available -- I agree with another reviewer that the one conducted by Kees Bakels has that honor -- I really don't think it's that bad. The real standouts here, as others have pointed out, are the Capriccio and Russian Festival. Simply gorgeous performances, and I think they justify purchase of this release by themselves. Between this set and Jarvi's, you'll have Rimsky covered within reason."
4,good!,I wasn't sure about purchasing this one since I'm not a huge fan of electro-fischerspooneresque music BUT it would've been a big mistake if I haven't bought it!This is what Fischerspooner lacks.......substance!
4,Smaller than I thought,"It is extremely cute but I had the impression it would be larger than it actually was. That's not necessarily something bad, but for me, I would've preferred it to be larger- ESPECIALLY for that price."
2,Does not fit tramontina ware,"Greetings, (For future customers)This lid is actually 9 3/8"" from inside to inside. Fits well inside a 10"" skillet. Is usable, but not satisfactory.Farberware should be notified."
2,NOT For the Deep Skillet,"I purchased the Farberware 12-Inch Glass Lid thinking it would fit my Farberware 12-Inch Deep Skillet. Silly me. It didn't fit. Not even close. It seems that while the curved side of the skillet arcs down to the base directly from the edge, the lid has a lip that is more or less perpendicular to its edge - an incompatible state of affairs. After spending a little time audibly pondering the mental capacity and pedigree of whoever at Farberware was responsible for this SNAFU, I ""fine-tuned"" the lip of the lid with a pair of blunt nose pliers and thumb/forefinger pressure to achieve an acceptable fit. My wife is satisfied so all is well.Realizing that a lot of Amazon shoppers probably would not take this course of action, I am submitting this review to advise fellow deep skillet lid seekers to look elsewhere for a lid that fits ""out of the box"" and to remind everyone that sometimes the 12 inches you're looking for is not the 12 inches you get. So be careful out there."
5,Skillet Review,It is so nice to have a lid that will fit the 12 inch Tfal skillet. Other brands of lids do not fit the 12 inch Tfal. Another plus is being able to see what is cooking without lifting the lid.
1,Not the Size Advertised,"The description for the 8"" lid implied that the diameter was 8"" and would fit most 8"" pans. However, the lid I received was only 7 3/4"" in diameter and doesn't fit any of my 8"" pots or pans."
4,Fits OK,This fits ok on the Farberware pot. It has a small lip so you might have issues if you are doing something like popping corn. I think the interior metal should be a little longer so the lid feels more secure.
2,It sended with big dent,"It sended with big dent.Fortunately, Glass is not broken.I think you should pay careful attention to manage items."
1,Farberware 8-Inch Glass Lid,did not fit the pot I needed it for. too much money for shipping on small item to justify sending back.
1,"12"" Glass Cover for frying pan","This cover works very well. Seals in moisture, but allows you to see what's cooking, and fits my 12"" Farberware perfectly."
5,It's a lid; it's OK,"It's a glass lid that fits my fry pan OK. What more is there to say. If you have an 8 inch fry pan and no lid, then buy this lid!"
1,Regarding the quality of product,"I'm highly disappointed in the glass lid and the company overall. The first shipment was lost in the mail. The second shipment was put on back-order and didn't arrive until 2 months later.Additionally...... It was supposed to fit a 10"" frying pan, but it doesn't. The lid diameter turned out to be a 9"" lid instead and sits too far into the pan to be of any use.On the contrary, the lid appears to be a very sturdy one and would probably serve well in the kitchen if it had been the appropriate size. Secondly, the company was very professional and apologetic about the delay in shipment and agreed to send a second lid as soon as possible, free of charge."
5,Quality product; good value for the money,"I just received the Faberware 12"" lid which I needed for a 12"" Cuisinart eco-skillet purchased at Ross. The lid fits perfectly, is of substantial quality and worked great last night. I really enjoy being able to watch the level of activity in the skillet after the lid goes on because it helps me adjust a burner that tends to burn a little hotter than it should. I will likely be replacing a few other old lids with comparable Faberware lids soon!"
4,"See-Through Lid, Not So Much","A glass frying-pan lid sounded great because it would allow me to see what I was cooking without lifting the lid. Well, not so much. As soon as the lid is placed over the cooking food, the inside steams-up so you can't see through it. I still have to lift the lid to check on the food. The lid fits my 10-inch Farberware frying pan perfectly, but the glass provides no advantage at all."
2,did not fit my 10-in farberware skillet,I am sure this would have made a fine lid... if it fit. I have a 10-inch farberware skillet and it is quite annoying that the lid did not fit it. I ended up just buying a skillet/lid set at a store.
4,Great Replacement Lid For Bialetti Leonardo 12-inch Skillet,"I purchased the Farberware 12-inch glass lid after I broke the original lid from my Bialetti Leonardo Genius ""Jumbo-Size"" 12-inch Deep Sauté skillet. It fits quite nicely. No complaints here.The only downside to this lid is that I think the handle is slightly small for my full-size male hands, and the rubberized grip material feels a little bit cheap.Overall, it's still a solid product and it does the job."
3,Replacement Glass LId,"Farberware 8-Inch Glass LidI purchased this lid hoping to replace a crock pot lid that was accidently dropped and broke. Unfortunately the metal ring around the outside will not let it to set down on the crock pot to form a seal. Right size but the ring holds it up. It is good quality and came quickly, it just won't work for me."
1,Farberware 10-inch Glass Lid is not 10-inches!,"Wish I had read ALL of the reviews BEFORE buying the ""Farberware 10-Inch Glass Lid"".Amazon's ""Product Features"" stating ""Fits most 10-inch pans"" is NOT useful or helpful.The specific, actual, lid dimensions should be stated.The ENTIRE lid ""falls into"" my 9-7/8-inch (actual I.D. dimension) pan.I had previously purchased a Farberware 12-inch Glass Lid, from Amazon, and IT DID measure 12-inches in diameter.So WHY DOESN'T the Farberware 10-Inch Glass Lid, in a similar way, measure 10-inches in diameter, AS LABELED?This same REVIEW comment has been reported in several listed Amazon Reviews, but, sadly, I never looked at them.This same WRONG dimension (""10"" inches) is still shown in today's Amazon website.Guess I learned my lesson (the hard way) to ""Read All the Reviews"". And that important lesson cost me only $20 !"
4,Great top,It works well so far. The sizeof the lid fits my pan perfectly. The quality looks good and I have no complaint.
5,Love the lid!!,"Fits my frying pan perfectly. Would recommend to everyone. May be a little bit pricey, but worth it anyway. Thanks."
4,"12"" works fine","I ordered the 12"" version of this lid for a Calphalon Home Essentials 12"" 'Deep' Skillet. I was wary given the reviews here saying that the 10"" size is a good 1/2th"" short or more, but thats not the case here.There is a *tiny* bit of slack when used on my skillet, so it wiggles a little. Maybe 1/8th-1/4th"" space.. enough to shake a little if you move it by hand but *not* enough to leave a gap for steam to escape, and certainly no where near enough for the lid to tip into the skillet. Its a 96% fit, it only moves if I mess with it, otherwise the inner lip of this lid fits fine inside the rim of the skillet.Very happy with this solution given the price and that I was taking a chance. If you are looking for a 100% seal with a 12"" pan then be wary I guess, as this one is only 11"" 3/4ths-7/8ths or so."
1,Handle falls off,"Bought this lid a little over a year ago and it worked fine up until a few days ago. The screw started coming loose on the handle to the lid. I was able to screw it back in, but it got worse and worse. Now the screw doesn't work at all and the handle won't stay on any more. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this lid as I was expecting it to last far longer. Cheapo no name pots and lids from the local 'mart' store have lasted over 3 years and are still going strong. Won't be buying another Farberware product ever again."
4,good lid,I bought this pan for my new skillet and use it a lot. I like being able to watch my food cooking. My only complaint is that the lid does not have a steam hole like my Lodge lid does.
5,Fits Farberware 10-inch frying pan & 8 qt. pot,Very pleased with this product. Perfect fit for the Farberware 10-inch frying pan & 8 qt. pot.
5,Fits better than the lid my pot came with,"This lid is simply a good product. Kinda pricey for just the lid. But it's not easy finding replacement lids, so worth it."
4,Works like a charm,"As another reviewer, mine also came with a dent in the inner lip of the lid. It's really no big deal. I just corrected it accordingly and it works perfectly. I use this on a 12inch Denmark saute' pan. Would have been 5 stars if not for the bent lid."
5,An excellent recording.,"Antal Dorati's recording of ""The Nutcracker"" with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra is a wonderful treat for ""Nutcracker"" fans. This performance boasts considerably more polish than ""The Nutcracker"" often gets, making it an excellent choice for Tchaikovsky fans with discriminating standards. Certain portions of the score may be played too often, but a recording of the full ballet reminds us of the totality of Tchaikovsky's achievement with this score, as well as the underheard beauties that still lurk within it. The ""Sleeping Beauty"" highlights on this two-disc set, performed by Anatole Fistoulari and the London Symphony, are a nice lagniappe, but it's Dorati's ""Nutcracker"" that makes it worth the purchase price."
3,"good, but missing pages","I liked that this book doesn't waste ink on real photos. The diagrams are clean and easy to follow. The concise descriptions of each knot are interresting and the rating system gives a quick summary. It's a great quick reference guide for the camper trailer, or glove box. However, I found my copy of this book to be missing pages 277-284, even though there are knots listed in the index for those pages. Also, it would have been nice if the authors had included some braids, mats, harnesses, etc."
2,Soothing is not how I would describe this.,"I have this CD, and the other three in the series, Natural, Classical and Ambient. This one is the exact opposite of soothing to me. The constant plunking sound reminds me of a kid's toy piano...and I have tried to like it. I decided to rotate the four CDs each night. This one irritates me so much that I have yet to get to sleep without changing to something else.This is probably a personal thing, but I suggest you listen to the clip available on Amazon before you buy."
3,nice,"Not the best basketball movie. Not the worst. Some wooden acting, some very good talent wasted on the plotline. Interesting that Tyler Henderson got NO ROYALTIES from it, though."
2,Not what I expected,"Not that good. I expected this to be as good as all the rest of Donna Jo Napoli's books (Sirena!!) but I was extremely disappointed. Hardly any thing happened, it seemed like, because every thing was so dullly written. The idea and some of the events that happened in the book could have made a good story, but instead, it was extremely dull and boring. I expected this book to be as good as every one had made it out to be.Dull and boring. Not worth reading. Find some thing else."
4,A 14 year old book critic.,"I loved the book...His culture is partiallaly Islam and in the culture women have to keep their faces covered. There is avery good chance that that was the only woman he had seen before he was transformed. Second, when he was with the lionesses he had just turned into the lion and wasn't prepared to deal with the impulses he would experience. Lastly there is no proof that the beast was from france. It is the authors interpretation of the story of the beast. All in all I enjoyed the book. It was very good. If you like the concept I recommend The raging quiet..."
1,Beastly Mess,"I did not care for this at ALL. First of all he is transformed into a lion, not a wildebeast/bear/bison/thing. That for me lowered the interest factor. And the banging the lionesses scene was well..disturbing. I'll stick with my french speaking candles and uptight clocks anyday."
4,Beauty and the beast,This is the Persian version of Beauty and the Beast. A bad sacrifice angers a fairy who curses the Persian Prince Orasmyn. He becomes a lion. The curse will only be broken if a human woman falls in love with him.I gave this 4 stars in stead of 5 because Napoli went on way too much about the beast's eating habits. She described just about every meal he ate and how he caught it. It went on for many chapters. Also the end happened so quickly it was like she just grew tired of writing.This book has a lot of sexual content that I dont think would be appropriate for teens under age 15.If you like this book I recommend Bound by Donna Jo Napoli.
3,Different take on Beauty and the Beast,"I was really looking forward to this book. I love all the fairy tales and thought a different take on Beauty and the Beast would be refreshing. While this book was not bad, it was not that great either. It seemed to stretch on forever. There were a few good parts which got me going but for most part, I just didn't feel compelled to read it. It was more of a struggle for me. I would have to admit the last part of the book was probably best. Once I got to that part I didn't want to put it down. I'm not really sure if I would recommend this book or not. I know that I didn't find it compelling but I think that some might."
4,Wow!,"This is the tale of The Beast -- that is, his life, adventures and experiences before he met Beauty. The world is so vividly depicted I could amost see and taste the world Donna Jo Napoli describes. I wish there had been such great Teen Fiction being published when I was a teenager!"
3,WCW Bash at the Beach 2000 review,"The Lt.Loco-Juventu Guerrera-Cruiserweight title match was a basic,solid,high-flying match. The Big Vito-Norman Smiley & Ralphus Handicap match for the Hardcore title was ok for a hardcore title match. The Daffney-Ms.Hancock-Wedding Gown match was a dumb mindless filler. The Kronik-Perfect Event-World Tag Team title match was a basic,solid tag team bout. The Kanyon-Booker T match was not great but pretty good. The Scott Steiner-Mike Awesome-U.S title match was a good match ruined by a lousy DQ ending. The Vampiro-KISS Demon-Graveyard match was a down & dirty but somewhat boring brawl. The Shane Douglas-Buff Bagwell match was a pretty solid brawl. The Hulk Hogan-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was nothing more then a lazy,dumb,BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT. The Goldberg-Kevin Nash match was slow but still pretty good in some ways. The Booker T-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,smash-mouth brawl. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10."
4,"Entertaining, But Dated Look at Chicago Sports","Bob Logan takes an interesting look at Chicago's pro sports history (White Sox, Cubs, Bears, Bulls, Black Hawks, etc.) and the then-current scene from the late 1980's. The book is readable, informative, and entertaining. Logan examines several controversies surrounding Chicago sports, but he never gets too serious. The book mixes contemporary with historical, and makes for a fun read."
3,broke after 2 uses,i really was looking forward to making my spritz cookies for christmas so order the cookie press. my grandkids and i was making our cookies when the piece that press the dough down broke that was a real mess. so i was unable to enjoy the press with the kids. iwas very disappointed to the fact that it broke so easliy on such a soft dough. so i return it and i have to say the return was as easily as could be. the web site walk me through the whole thing and give me the right paper work to return my item. and my account was refunded. thank you for that part of it. in the future i will buy another one this time just not plasticed
1,Broke on its first use!,"So I'm all ready to make Christmas cookies, I buy this cookie press, and it breaks before I get cookie one on the cookie sheet. The manufacturer will hear from me! Do not buy. This is a flimsy excuse for a cookie press."
4,they work,"These things get the job done pretty well, but they are on the shorter side. Otherwise they can take my 200 lbs pretty well."
2,Serious design flaw,"I wanted a wall phone, and that's why I purchased this model. I thought it was the sleekest looking wall-phone I'd seen. There were a couple flaws... the first was that it won't mount to a standard jack. You'll have to modify your jack to one that plugs directly into the phone (no cord). They tell you what to have done, but that was aggravating.But the more serious issue is that when the phone is mounted on the wall (finally) the phone loses touch with the contact points, so it can't charge. I put the required part in place to support the phone to be mounted in a vertical position (it's a plastic piece at that base of the phone). But the piece is about 1/8"" off of putting the handset in full contact.I'm sure it would be a fine phone, provided you didn't want to wall mount it. If you want to wall-mount, this phone is completely unusable since you can't charge it."
5,Desert Roses,I just started this book but I am sure it will be another good book all the ones by Tracie Peterson that I have read have been very good.
4,Works good for flies on the face.,"I use this as a fly repellant on my horses face. I put on a line about a inch under each eye. ( like a football player).. It works for days to keep the flies down on the face , some still come but the horses arent covered in them. This is the best repellant I have tried that will last a few days. The bad is that it is goopy and sticky and after using it all summer long the hair around the area I put it on will start to fall out(it regrows when discontinued). This product is not cheap but it last me the whole summer for the two horses so with that , the price isnt bad. Its also hard to find, as I have to buy it off the internet. Over all the product is great if you dont like to go out and spray down your horses everyday."
2,Yep...,"The Michael Halasz versions of Schubert's 1st and 2nd symphonies on Naxos are definately lighter and sunnier that the Blomstedt versions, and are therefore recommended over this particular disc."
2,A Surprising Disappointment,"Despite a love of Shubert's symphonies and Hurwitz's praise, I find myself disappointed with this disc. To be honest, I do not know if it is Blomstedt's performances or the symphonies themselves, as these are the only recordings of 1 & 2 I have heard. Given that, it just doesn't seem that the music of these early symphonies takes off the way it does in Beecham's 3, 5 & 6 disc or Gunzenhauser's 4 & Symphony in C disc...I end up drifting elsewhere rather than listening, which is something I do NOT normally do with Shubert, early or otherwise. I suspect that these symphonies are inferior to the rest, but I also have a feeling Blomstedt is a bit stolid here...I may have to get Halasz's 1 & 2 (Naxos) to be sure."
3,TOUGH TENORS,"Featuring the Tenor Saxes of Pat LaBarbera and Frank Foster and somtimes they are indistinguishable. Pat is featured on the opening track then Foster joins the group. No soprano sax playing but with the tenors sounding so much alike the acoustic pianist Fumio Karashima winds up soloing inbetween them. 66 min capped of by a 19:19 version of A Love Supreme but only the melodies of the first 2 movements, Acknowledgement and Resolution are played."
4,"Another Excellent Item from Amazon, Just dont Order the Envelopes!","Great business paper at a great price! Just dont order the matching envelopes, ours were all stuck together! The paper is fine however. Shipped quick and secure and does what paper does."
3,A bit roughed up,There was wrings on on almost every page!!! But it is readable and was worth the small price I paid.
5,"A must have item for anyone working in Theater, Film & T V","This book is a must have item for anyone working in the entertainment biz ,Film ,Theater,T V ,Concert .My crew calls it the bible.This is My third copy in the past four years (first two where stolen)and if I had to I'd buy one a year or more if need be,I'll never not have it in My tool box."
5,backstage handbook,"Great book, has everything you need to know and more about the backstage theatre just a useful book to have handy"
2,Backstage Handbook,"This product did help me slightly for my backstage, but not as much as i thought it would. I feel it could have helped more. I was told to get it for class, but we hardly used it. It was pointless buying the book. Wouldn't advise buying it"
4,An excellent reference to keep close at hand.,"A wonderful compilation of knowlege and ""other stuff you need to know"" when on set or backstage.As an overall theatrical/stage manual, this is a superior manual. As for the feature film world: it is an indespensible reference for Leadpersons and Art Directors. It is almost a MUST for Grips. Electrics will benefit more from Harry Box's ""The Set Lighting Technician's Handbook""."
3,Well....,"It is exactly as advertised, a handbook. It's chocked full of drawings of simple tools, diagrams, knot tying examples, stage layouts and such. This would benefit a stage hand starting out in the field and helps with terminology but provides no ideas or helpful hints on how to improve your career field. Still if you want a straightforward answer to a ""What is THAT?"" question then this is your book."
2,looks good -- works poor,"If you barely use a tea kettle and want one for a good price then maybe this is a good buy. Yes, it does look very nice and yes it is a very good price BUT.. the handle (like others have said) gets VERY hot and you can not pick it up without a potholder. The bell piece isn't attached to the kettle itself, so you need to take it off to pour - very likely to get misplaced too. But really though, the bell does not work and the there is absolutely no whisle at all. I went to answer the phone one day and the thing nearly evaporated all the water in it without a sound. I rather have something that is better made."
1,I shouldn't have ignored the bad review...,"I ignored the negative reviews, and ordered this item anyway, because I really liked the ""style"" of it, and badly needed a new kettle. When it arrived, I was pleased at the style, the balance, and performance... until water started leaking out from the bottom every time I filled it up. Not just from one weak area, but from the entire bottom portion, it would drip discolored, rusty looking water after boiling, if left standing with water in the kettle.Very disappointed, and worse, now I have to try and find yet another kettle that I like. It isn't worth the shipping cost to return this item, but I'm definately unhappy with the performance and would never recommend this item."
5,Lucky find,"I purchased this tea kettle as a gift so I haven't used it myself, but I have been the recipient of many cups of tea made with it. Though a bit small, it's quite attractive and sophisticated looking, and doesn't take a lot of space on the stovetop. It arrived unblemished and has remained so after much use. And the whistle doesn't break your eardrum! A very nice kettle."
3,Not the best,"I haven't had the rusting issues some have had nor have I gotten burnt or been unable to hear the whistle as others have mentioned, but it frankly just doesn't do a good job heating up (especially on a smooth top electric range). It needs a heavier weight base (preferably a flatter one too). I'm not gonna bother to replace it, as it's not that bad, but I'd look for a better one."
1,millenium,"I recently came in a time machine from the year 1826. There I was searching this thing called th'interrrnet and low and behold, there was my kettle from my previous life!!!I did some research and discovered that kettles (we actually called them 'The Pot' back in 1800's) in this present day of 2005 actually have slots in the back that connect to a long wire wrapped in 'plastic' that have a thing on the end called a 'plug' which goes into the wall and you get an 'electric' current. This powers the kettle, thus heating the water.I was so happy to find one like they have back in my day. Its nice to see some companies dont go with the technology and force their consumers to also buy a stove to heat their water on.Tatty Bye now..."
1,Mine ended up in the trash.,"I purchased mine about 18 months ago, but finally threw it out because of safety concerns. As others have indicated the handle gets way too hot. If this is same exact kettle, I'm really surprised it's still being sold."
5,Gets the job done!!!,"I really like this teakettle. It's great. It's pretty, so I don't mind leaving it on my stove all the time and it's easy to fill and clean. I really can't see spending more then $8.00 for something that's sole purpose is to boil water. I am very happy I bought this!"
1,A Real Junk,This kettle is single layer from bottom and the outlet cap is loose. This is a faberware product which is sold in walmart in less than five dollars. Don't put much hope with it. Will be returning it soon.
4,Teakettle,"Good size, not too big. Fits on 6"" stove burner. Nice looking, good price.Extremely loud whistle, at least for a small house. The whistle end must be taken off and replaced manually for pouring. I'm good with not losing stuff like that, but I suppose it could be a problem for some."
1,French Interactive Flashcard book (don't bother),"For some reason it didn't occur to me that this would be a BOOK, not a book with flash cards in it.This is an expensive book with simple words/phrases printed in it and surronded by a border simulating a flashcard.Information density is low, price high and flashcards non-existant.In summary if you are looking for flash cards skip this."
5,"yummy , yummy in my bunny's tummy",She loves em !!!!! my three year old does! very chocolaty taste & not overly sweet ! Soo hopping goood !
3,Not as good as cinnamon flavor,Okay but chocolate Teddy Grahams or the cinnamon flavor Bunny Grahams have far superior flavor. My preschooler will eat one or two but mostly leaves the bowl if I give them to her for a snack.
5,Yummy Little Bunnies!,"I expected these cookies to taste like animal crackers, but they are so much better. Real chocolate flavor and very crunchy. Best of all, low in calories and all natural. Love them!"
1,Severely overpriced at $5.99,"Let me be clear here: I did not have high expectations for a mandoline priced at about six bucks. Having said that, I did expect to be able to create reasonably simple cuts like french fries (if not superfine juliennes). But alas, it was not to happen: the blades and supports are so thin and flexible that getting even semi-even cuts is nearly impossible. Slices are noticably thicker on one end than the other, but the blade won't cut through a vegetable without a little pressure (which is what's warping the cuts).The hand-guard at least is better designed.In short, save your six bucks and either cut by hand or buy a real mandoline. This one will only frustrate you."
2,Unclear,"I thought it would be a good idea to cover the camera I bought, but this ""product"" didn't make much sense. I couldn't really understand the ""contract"" that arrived. Never used it, of course."
2,REPLACEMENT PLAN FOR ION TURNTABLE,"I PURCHASED THE ION USB TURNTABLE BUT IT IS BACKORDERED. AT THE TIME OF THE ORDER, I PURCHASED THE 1 YEAR REPLACEMENT PLAN. HOWEVER, THE REPLACEMENT PLAN AT THIS POINT DOES NO GOOD WITHOUT THE PRODUCT. I FEEL IT UNFAIR THAT MY TIME FOR THIS REPLACMENT PLAN WILL BE USED UP WAITING FOR THE PRODUCT TO ARRIVE. I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE GIVEN AN EXTENSION OF TIME FOR THE COVERAGE ON THIS PLAN AND THE COVERAGE SHOULD NOT START UNTIL I RECEIVE THE PRODUCT IT IS GOING TO PROTECT."
3,have not had a need to use this protection yet,"it is a good offer as protection, the price is right and on an item like the gps I bought it is always a good idea to have extra coverage"
5,Very Satisfied,After reviewing all of the imformation the plan is a very reasonable one.I am satisfied with its coverage. Thank you.
4,1-year replacement plan for voice recorder,"Though I hope I don't have to use it, this plan, for the money, seems like a good deal."
5,McGard Lug Nuts,"Great lugs, McGard has always made great quality lug nuts. I remove my wheels frequently and the factory stainless capped nuts can't take the extra abuse."
4,"The most ""complete"" book on the subject yet","Simple, precise, easy to read and understand, methodical, plenty of explanation - the INDISPENSABLE HANDBOOK for patch clamp/single channel recording. It's one of the books that's a ""must have"" for all grads, post docs and scientists working on electrophysiology and am sure that everyone will have something to gain from it.Only complaint - since single channel analysis so heavily relies on building on models, there needs to be more description on it. There are only a couple of chapters with very elementary model building stuff which isn't going to be of much help to people, except to the ones who are just starting out. (But that's just a personal opinion)"
3,"Good story, but.....","I give this book 5 stars for content but only 1 star for length. I'v read chapters in books longer than this entire ""booklet"". As for the ending, I must have missed something in the reading because it did not make sense to me. Maybe one has to read the previous books by Ms. Sanra to understand the ending."
1,Don't buy it!,"I've gone through a lot of gates, this one is the worst. Its difficult to set up and not very sturdy. The ""secure"" arm that holds it in place is hard to get positioned into place and it pops out very easy!! We threw this thing away. . its terrible!"
1,"dangerou for a ""safety"" product",first moments after i put this gate up to keep my 9 month old daughter out of the kitchen it took all of the paint right off the walls down to the frame! 4 big patches....then my daughter tried to pull up on it and it slides around on the wall...its a good thing i was right there to get her..and then from the design w/all the little holes my dearest baby did a pull up and lodged her toes in it ( ya know like climbing a chainlink fence when you were a kid) and tried to climb over it!!! i took it back the next day!!!
1,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,"I think it is important to read reviews first before you buy any product especially this one.CONS: Heavy, hard to adjust, no swing (meaning you need to lift your legs to go through - incovenient espcially if you are not tall), pressure mount did not work, bulkyI believe Safety 1st shoudl discontinue this.I suggest go for the metal gates with swing. Cost more but why pay for something that does not work and will frustrate you - it'll just be a waste of time andmoney."
4,Child Safety Gate,"Good and sturdy, better than the other I had as far as quality made, but a bit tough to open and close. Overall a nice gate though."
1,Worthless,This gate was a baby shower gift which I used as a spare. After just a few months of using it only a couple handfuls of times the handle broke leaving the gate worthless. I used it from the time my baby was 6 - 9 months in age.
1,DONT GET IT!,"This gate has ruined my wall, you have to fight with it for 20 minutes to even get it up, and then it still wont stay. its not safe at all!"
3,not worth your money,It seems like the more you take it down the harder it is to put it back up. It would probably work very nice if you put it up the first time and never touched it again or only needed it to get you by until you purchased something else. Its definately not worth the money
5,Great gate for the price,Got this gate to keep my son in his room when he wakes up in the morning and gets out of his bed. The gate is very easy to use and does the intended job of keeping our 1 1/2 year old safe from the rest of the house.
4,"Does the job, but you have to keep an eye on it","It was easy for my children to push it down after they reached a certain age (maybe 16+ months - can't quite remember), but it served its purpose up until that point."
5,Good one,"I have tried all kinds of gates and my two oldest were able to take it down, but this one sometimes I even have hard time to open it. Overall it's a great investment to keep my kiddos safe."
4,Great dog gates,"We bought this same gate a few years ago (earlier version) for our small dog, to keep her contained in the downstairs area while we're at work. Just ordered another one to keep her gated on our deck (since she's injured her leg). They've been great gates for this purpose."
1,Terrible,"The directions say to expand it to the size of the space between the walls and then turn the lock. The plastic isn't sturdy enough to stay together when you turn the lock so by the time the lock is turned all the way, the hole it's supposed to lock into can't fit the handle. I tried a few different configurations and the ones that I was able to make the lock work weren't tight enough to support a light breeze.Don't buy."
3,BIBLICAL MESSAGES,this is like christian rock with a mix of goth.read the lyrics on www.a-zlyrics.com and find out how him preaches the word!
5,Outstanding!,"This book prepares you mentally and physically for a violent confrontation. It covers human physiology, biology, aerobic and anaerobic training, strength training, stress work, aggression drills, hill work, and motivation. The proper use of equipment, partner, and solo drills are described as well. The author offers practical, street-worthy advice to get yourself into shape for combat. Well written and highly recommended!Lawrence KaneAuthor of Blinded by the Night, among other titles"
2,Very Disappointing,"While there should be no doubt that Dr. Davis knows this material well and clearly has a point in mind, his writing skills are insufficient to lucidly express that point. With an unclear time line, grammatical errors, word omissions and typing errors, this book is very hard to follow. In addition to an extreme lack of organization, this work consistently makes statements which are unsupported by documented fact, ambiguous and generalized. Without a bibliography, it is impossible to tell whether the author is reciting fact or merely dictating opinion at any given point.I would very much like to see these ideas written in a more lucid and timelined manner. Perhaps Dr. Davis should enlist the help of an established writer and a more diligent editor for his next publication."
2,Magnavox makes crappy products.,"I purchased the MRD200 a year ago. After 10 months the audio would cut out when watching television, listening to radio, or playing a CD. No audio through the speakers or through the earphone jack. After a while it would return. The problem got worse and worse so I called Magnavox support and they said I would get a replacement if I shipped the unit to their exchange center in Tennessee. It cost me $61.00 via UPS, no RMA, no refund for shipping. Two weeks later I received a replacement, an upgrade actually, to the MRD210. I set it up and it works fine EXCEPT when watching a television program. With both the MRD's audio and the TV's audio on there is a delay that causes an echo. It doesn't happen all the time, it drifts in and out. After 15 minutes on-line with Magnavox's support I learn THIS IS NORMAL! The MRD200 didn't do it. I can't imagine this is normal, let alone acceptable. I won't be buying Magnavox products in the future."
4,best system for your buck,PROS:: POWERFUL ENOUGH SOUNDEASY TO INSTALLEXCELLENT VALUECONS:: REMOTE NOT UNIVERSALDVD SLOW WHEN LAODINGNO S-VIDEO CABLE
4,No dts Decoder,"This unit does not have a dts decoder and cannot play dts DVDs. Even though the Amazon tech details listings said it did when I looked and the editorial review said it did, the MRD210 does not. I put in a dts disc and the player said it couldn't play it. Also note that this unit has only 2 audio inputs, one for TV and one for AUX. In my case I found I wanted a third set since I have a TV, a TiVo, and a VCR. Also note there is no video selection capability in this unit so your TV needs multiple inputs and the remote is not universal."
3,To Clarify James O'Rear (Black & White Picture) Review,"This DVD player can send video output for both NTSC and PAL(European/Asian) TVs. If your DVD System Setup is set to AUTO or PAL and you hook up your DVD player to NTSC you will get Black and White Picture. Change your DVD System to NTSC by using menu ""Picture Setup"" and then Choosing Option ""TV System"" and you'll get color picture. I hope this helps."
1,Absolutely lousy,"I purchased this item in July. I hooked it up and it did not work. I called customer service twice and was put on hold both times. The second time the customer service fellow was pleasant but not helpful. I rewired the surround system while he waited(seemed like it took forever). In the end, it did not work at all. So it sits here as a $200 paperweight that my wife teases me about."
4,muy buena sorpresa,"No conocía mucho a Pizzarelli, compré el DVD algo inseguro, y les aseguro que no me arrepentí. Es un recital entretenido donde suena una muy buena banda, y donde los músicos de Pizzarelli, conjugan una muy buena relación en cuanto a respetar los estilos Swimg y Hot Club de Francia que Pizzarelli impone. No hay geniales o impresionantes perfomances individuales, pero reconozco que todo suena bien. Resalto la estética del show y la calidad del sonido y video. Es una buena opión para aquellos que quieren revivir classicos del Jazz."
1,cheap junk,"Fell of the counter and the plastic bit holder shattered. The bit holder is made of cheap thin plastic. Once that breaks, its completely useless. Also it is cumbersome in the hand. Also, bits fall out of the holder (unless your working upside down) which means you have to hold the bit with one hand while twisting with the other. There is a magnet in the plastic holder to hold a bit, however, nothing to hold the plastic holder in the handle so it falls out. Threw it in the trash"
2,Plastic handle breaks easily,"As you can see in the pictures someone else posted, the plastic handle breaks very easily. The problem is that the metal bits (which are fine) are held by a plastic handle, so when you turn with any force the metal bit just turns inside the plastic handle and breaks it apart.I had mine break while trying to unscrew small screws from the bottom of a laptop. Not very high-torque work, but enough to break the handle and render the tool useless.I salvaged it for a little while by wrapping the split handle with wire and gaffer tape, and then babying the tool thereafter.Someone else mentioned Husky, and I have a Husky tool that is much stronger: metal holding metal. Unfortunately it doesn't have the choice bits that this one had. (The bits are not interchangeable.)"
1,"Good concept, but low quality materials","Like another reviewer, I bought this at a local hardware store. Although it is a good concept, and convenient to have multiple bits that store inside the handle, the quality of the materials is very poor.I have not had problems with the plastic, like others, but with the metal bits themselves. The metal is VERY soft, and the bit will become deformed after only a few uses (Imagine when a the head of a screw becomes stripped, but this time it's happening to the screwdriver).I do not recommend this product, and strongly urge the manufacturer to make the interchangeable bits out of a harder metal with a higher yield strength."
1,"Cheap tool, handle broke after first use!","I went to my local hardware store looking for a screwdriver to open up my Macbook Pro and found this one with the correct bit. When I inspected it, I had my reservation as the bit holder was made out of plastic, but I had no choice as I needed it that day. Sure enough it broke after I unscrewed 6 screws. I jury-rigged it with tape and finished the job.Pros: good design because it has hard to find bits and everything stores in a compact handle, I really like the bits as they are tough and precise.Cons: the handle is the weakest point as it needs to be made with metal and not plastic. It WILL BREAK, so until they improve the handle DO NOT BUY IT unless all you need are the bits.VERDICT: DO NOT BUY!!!(I'll be posting pictures too...)"
3,Item title wrong,"The title of this item says ""Serewdriver"", not ""Screwdriver"", so it is hard to find when searching for previous orders or looking through your email confirmations for the item. Amazon should fix the spelling."
5,Review of A Gypsy Lady to Die For,"Zane M. Smith has created a book that the reader cannot put down until the last page has been devoured. I picked the book up to read on a plane trip and after I started reading, I never looked up to eat, drink or use the restroom. I felt like I would miss something if I stopped . The story is an intense detective fiction, and Smith has created some memorable characters with his vivid and witty descriptions. The plot is twisted and keeps you guessing until the last page. This is one book that ended too soon!!! I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action, humor, suspense and mystery. This book has it all and then some."
5,Love It,I bought this toy for a screaming deal on amazon and then the price dropped so I got it for $6. Also when I received it there was a bonus pack attach. Thank you amazon. My children play with it for hours on end. There are so many different creatures they can create.
1,Lacks substance,"This Clan-book completely misses the point, we already know the Ventrue are the money-makers of the Camarilla. What we wanted from a Clan-book was what was not obvious, the secrets of the Clan, the Outcasts, etc. What we got was useless drivel and quite frankly a waste of money and time."
2,Lots of background little content,This sourcebook provides more background material than any of the others in the series but very little in the way of substantial material. You will find useful information on Ventrue attitudes and history. However unlike other installments of the Clanbook series this book offers no special advantage to the Ventrue. Also missing is any useful guidelines on handling a Ventrue's power structure.
5,Wanna play a Ventrue? Get this!,"I had previously only played a Malky, so when a friend gave me this book, I was intrigued. Lots of history, ideas for how to play, and other goodies make this a real treat. If you wanna have lots of fun in this game, be a Ventrue. Allow the snob out!"
5,A Blessing to Young and Old Alike,"I first encountered The Clown of God in college, during a course on spirituality and developmental psychology. It tells the story of a poor beggar boy who finds joy and fame in his juggling -- and surprising blessings as well.dePaola does an excellent job adapting this ""old story"" to medieval Italy; the setting fits the story like a glove. The delightful illustrations bring the story to life. My children love pouring over the rich images.A great story for kids and adults alike, The Clown of God gets my highest recommendation."
5,Beautiful,"I am no expert in children's literature. I have a four year old and a two year old, both boys, and by and large I evaluate a children's book based on how it captivates them. My children love this book.It is a beautiful story, both in illustration and in message. While I acknowledge that I can be sentimental at times, I still have to smile when I think of this story. The end of the story was so compelling to me, that I cried the first time I read it."
5,just MY opinion,"A masterpiece in both story and pictures. It should have received Caldecott honors when it was eligible. DePaola will be remembered for several achievements in books...the 26 FAIRMOUNT AVENUE series, the BARKERS series, STREGA NONA, NANA UPSTAIRS & NANA DOWNSTAIRS, and others, and THIS extraordinary book."
2,Cree-pee,"I read this book as a child, and it completely creeped me out. If you are not a fan of clowns and death, stay away from this book!"
3,"Very good, but.....","At a bargain price, this is a very good version of this spectacular score for beginners. Nobody mentioned this in their reviews, so I would like to pose this question: why do the cellos play IN THE WRONG CLEF during the march!? Listen to any other recording and you know something is dreadfully wrong here.Thankfully -- or not -- the torture lasts for only 16 bars, and the rest of the recording is fine. But in the words of the late Yul Brynner: ""Is a puzzlement!"""
3,"Good, but not great","This is a lovely recording for those who just wish to enjoy the music, but the tempi are much to fast to make it a practicle recording for dancers to use. For a more danceable recording, I recommend the one on the Naxos label, conducted by Andrew Mogrelia, who is a principal conductor for the San Francisco Ballet."
3,"Great woodwinds, very good strings, strident brass","There are several existing reviews for this recording, so my additions will be quick. I bought this recording because I have been happy with several other RCO recordings, and Dorati's Tchaikovsky Nutcracker on Mercury with the London Symphony is a classic.I have no objections concerning tempos or interpretation, and the woodwinds are incredibly good. My concern is with the strident tone and intonation troubles in the brass instruments. So many RCO recordings capture excellent performance in all sections including the brass, but this one is the exception. I don't understand how such a wonderful conductor and ensemble could publish a such troubled recording."
5,"Very informative, useful and helpful!","This book helped me a great deal with my French studies. Everytime I find a French word I don't understand, I never worry because I always know it's in this dictionary. I've never found such a helpful dictionary before!"
5,The best paperback French dictionary,"This is the most complete and useful French dictionary available in paperback. Oxford has done us a huge service by introducing the ""Compact"" size. The dictionary is manageable and uses extraordinarily clear typeface and layout, while covering more words than its competitors--in greater depth, too! I only wish Oxford would introduce ""Compact"" versions of its other dictionaries--since its most thorough paperback dictionaries for other languages (the ""pocket"" series = h/c ""desk"") are wimpy and fall short of such competition as the Webster's New World series. But not in French. This is the best paperback dictionary available, extremely modern and up-to-date...and, yes, I *have* looked at them all!P.S. The reviewer who writes, ""it doesn't tell the correct usage"" is not right. The use of illustrative phrases and the thorough listing of distinct meanings are exemplary for a dictionary of this size."
4,Hard sided Gun Case,For an inexpensive case this case works well and looks great. Its a great product
2,That One Song... Buy it single,"Annabelle, you are the only song that will ever want, tricked by a colorful and interesting font,thinking back I cant believe, I shelled out the cash for the whole cd,and now its lost, with only one good song.Sorry, I am not hating on the band or music but the only song I enjoy is Annabelle. I took the chance an got the whole thing, as previously mentioned. I cant identify or stomach any of the other music/ lyrics. I have replayed it several times, but its the most expensive single song I ever paid for. Everyone has different taste, but be warned, this is a very unique sound. Sorry Hail Social, I love ""Annabelle"" both the sounds and lyrics, the whole thing gets the excitement going. Just not sure what happened after that. This song alone is worth 7 out of 5 possible stars!"
1,OUCH!,"What is this Im listening to? It's like an ABBA cover album. Very soft, very lame. Keyboards where guitars should be. Cheezy choruses!! Several good songs, many that are just laughable. 1st album rocked and this one is a joke. Why didn't someone step up and say ""hey, we can't put this tripe out there!"". ???"
1,Avoid!,"Have to agree with the majority of other reviewers on here. I pre-ordered this album on the strength of their first. It was on ebay within a week. All the originality and great tunes of the first album have vanished to be replaced with dodgy disco cheese. Don't be tempted, this really is terrible."
1,What happened?,"When I read the first review of this album equating it with ABBA I was sure the reviewer was just being a jerk. Well, they were actually being kind. I really liked much of Hail Social's first release, nothing spectacular but some really nice tunes. I can't even imagine the circumstances that took place for the band to produce Modern Love & Death. From start to finish it is nothing but sappy cheese laden nonsense. The sound is so much different from their first release which isn't always a bad thing but in this case the new direction is so far from anything cool not even crappy radio stations should be playing this stuff. I am so disheartened by this album because Hail Social is one of those bands that I was expecting to see evolve and create some really interesting music. What a let down."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for Beach Boys fans!","Wow! is all I can say about this DVD! Even a casual BB fan will love this. The documentary footage is superb and the video clips of the boys really make this a great reason to make yourself comfortable on the sofa for the evening and enjoy. The sound quality is great throughout but the bonus surround sound remixes will blow you away, especially ""Sail On Sailor"" and ""God Only Knows"". This DVD really makes you appreciate how much hard work and care went into their songs."
4,An excellent documentary,Don't look to this DVD for the best of the Beach Boys music. Endless Harmony covers all the bases as a career highlights documentary. I would have been willing to pay extra to have Dolby 5.1 mixes of every song on the DVD. There are six good songs on the DVD with Dolby 5.1 mixes but they are accessed separately from the documentary. A must have DVD for fans and a great intro if you don't know much about them.
1,Sucks,"I'm sorry I wasted money on this dud. If I had known the thing wouldn't have a complete song on it, I would have saved my money. Guess I had better look for that key word ""concert"" to get the real deal."
2,"TOO MUCH TALK, TOO LITTLE MUSIC","BEING AN OLD BEACH BOY FAN, I WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS DVD. THE MAIN DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT IT IS A DOCUMENTARY AND NOT A MUSIC DVD. YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR BACKGROUND MUSIC. DOCUMENTARY DVD'S HAVE THE LIFE SPAN OF DEAD FISH."
3,The Beach Boys Story - The Mike Love Version,"This documentary will appeal to Beach Boys Fans. The not so well informed must be warned that this sad tale is very much the way that Mike Love sees it. He is always eager to claim credit for the Brian Wilson, is totally dismissive of the most interesting period of Beach Boys history, (Smile), and is unwilling to acknowledge other collaborators such as Van Dyke Parks, Tony Asher, and Gary Usher.I'm not quite sure what the contribution of Sean Lennon achieves, other than to say he is a fan. Having said all that, this is an excellent documentary, with excellent rare footage, which proves just what a talent Brian Wilson was/is and what a contribution the Beach Boys sound made to popular music. Worth Seeing"
3,"The Good, the Bad, the OOGLY..","The Good - made in USA, good fit/finish, quality materials. Overall, better materials than my Jet jointer.The Bad - table was not flat (off by about 1/16th). I called Delta, the lady was clueless, thought I was talking about the width measurements... She did, however send me a new table.The OOGLY - replacement table arrived, it is more warped than the original! Also in this category, the saw vibrates more than I would like. And the dust collector is useless; I replaced it with a flat, 6x6 adapter (4"") by cutting two slots in the top of the adapter and adding a screw to hold the bottom. Works great with an 1100 cfm collection system.Also, I installed the riser, but had some difficulty with the alignment pins - they are very soft, and don't fit that well. I finally had to file them down to get the riser installed.Overall, not terribly impressed with this product."
4,Fantastic machine--except...,"The saw itself is nothing less than I expected from Delta. I received my 28-299A in 4 days; it went together well and runs flawlessly. My only complaint is with the unbelieveably cheap, plastic dust connector. It is thin and held in place with a spring clip which falls open in use because of the weight of the 4 inch adapter and collector hose. What on earth were the Delta design engineers thinking when they decided this was an acceptable feature for this saw? I have used the saw extensively and found guide blocks and thrust bearings very easy to adjust without tools. The blade tracks perfectly even after hours of continuous use. Come on Delta...improve the dust collection and make it equal in quality to the rest of the machine!"
4,An outstanding package.,"I recently bought this package ... and was delighted with nearly everything. It shipped quickly, came packaged well and was very easy to put together using Delta's instructions. Except for being fairly heavy and hard to lift (ask a friend to help set the saw on the stand) everything went smoothly and was operable in less than 2 hours. This was my first mobile base, but certainly not my last. How wonderful! The included blade is not great but a good spare to have around for tighter curves in thinner material. The only drawback was that the included fence was about 1/32"" out of plumb with the table. The rails are perfectly level with my top, but the fence tilts slightly toward the blade. I'm sure this will only affect very tall stock and I can add an auxilliary fence if needed, but thought that was a little disappointing. Otherwise a very nice package."
5,EXCELLENT MACHINE,"DELTA HAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST BANDSAW OUT THERE FOR THE PRICE. THE 1-1/2 HP MOTOR HAS PLENTY OF POWER FOR EVEN THE MOST DENSE HARD WOODS. THE MACHINE RUNS SMOOTH AND STEADY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE MACHINE IN A SHOW SO I CANNOT COMMENT ON EASE OF ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER, I HAVE FOUND DELTA'S MANUELS TO BE VERY COMPREHENSIVE IN THE PAST. THE MOBILE BASE IS GREAT FOR WOODWORKERS WITH LIMITED SHOP SPACE OR FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK OUT OF OUR GARAGE. I ONLY WISH THAT DELTA WOULD MAKE A PACKAGE DEAL WITH A MOBILE BASE,FENCE, AND RISER BLOCK."
4,mindreader needed,"this is my first band saw. i put it together in a couple of hours, without assistance. i suggest help, parts of it are quite heavy. hooking up the belt drive was a little bit of trial and error, the instructions were okay, but not great. i've been using the machine quite alot and it seems fine so far. i plan to add the neck extension when i get up the courage. fit and finish were fine. delta blue grey contrasts nicely with the fine ground cast iron table. demetrious"
1,item not received even after 1.5 month,"Even after placing the order on 31st August,2012, the item has not been shipped yet. I am not even getting reason what is holding it up?"
5,Favorite book,This is one of our very favorite books. All of my kids love to repeat the words. We never get tired of it!
1,The Item pictured is not the item that showed up.,"The item pictured is slightly different than what showed up. The diaphragm that I received had a piece of plastic in the diaphragm that kept the valve open and the sprinklers continued to run while ""off""."
5,Orbit Valve Diaphram,"When my inground sprinkler valve broke,my sprinkler guy from ""Nassua/Suffolk Irrigation""told me they no longer made the parts to repair them. He wanted to charge me over $500. to change the six zones over to another brand.I did a little research and found all I needed to make the repair myself. Found the parts and fired the Nassua/Suffolk Irrigation guy.The parts are perfect they shipped fast and I am happy with this purchase."
4,Manxli,"Okay, so you may be familiar with the sounds of traditional Scottish and Irish folk music mixed with rock 'n roll or blues but ... the Isle of Man has something special up it's sleeve!""Playing traditional folk along with jazz, rock `n roll, and blues, peppered with some James Taylor and Paul Simon numbers, the Stationary Willberries do more than their fair share to keep Manx music alive on the Island and across Europe."
1,"Boring at best, annoying at worst","Microsoft JScript.NET Programming left me disappointed. The book reads like a tiresome rehash of too many JavaScript programming tutorials. Rogers frequently includes coding style tips that programmers are probably already quite familiar with. These distract from the JScript.NET content. The book contains information about some .NET core library classes, including networking and XML. A separate reference on the .NET core library is more useful than this half-hearted coverage.You may like Microsoft JScript.NET Programming if you only have a very basic grasp of JavaScript/JScript and you don't want to have to learn very much about the .NET core libraries or CLR."
2,Not what I thought,"I was looking for a book about client side scripting. This book is about using JScript with the .NET framework to create server side scripts.Sorry, but with the invent of C# and VB.NET, I already know how to write server side code. In my opinion, this is just another language to work with the .NET framework, and it is not as good as either C# or VB.NET.Personally, I wouldn't waste my time learning this language, but the book covers it fairly well."
1,"Made in Mexico, could have guessed, I didn't work.","I have used Intermatic timers for decades. I never had a problem with one. The one I received today was unusable. The contacts for one pole were welded together. Maybe it was returned by someone else and it didn't get into the scrap pile. It should have. I compared this one to an older model and found that there were several areas that had changed notably the quality of the wave strips that make the contact arms. These were weak and could barely break the contact on the pole that was still working. Just another bad idea, sending our manufacturing to another third world economy."
4,Birdsong,"A very enjoyable heartwrenching tale. Well acted, beautiful scenery, and realistic re-enactment of the British World war 1 fighting against the Germans in France. But not for the faint hearted. Yes, I would recommend it to someone."
5,An epic love story!,"I just finished this movie and all I can say is WOW! Easily the best love story I've seen in a long time. The performance that Eddie Redmayne gives is amazing and heartbreaking. I love period movies and this is also a very well done. The locations, art direction and costume design had me feeling as if I was getting a glimpse of the period of the 1910's into World War I. The misery those brave men experienced in the trenches in palpable through this story. Highly recommended!!."
5,Captivating,Captivating from beginning to end. I was so glad this was the equivalent of two movies so I can relish every moment. Eddie is a fabulous actor.
4,Romance,I so enjoyed this movie. The characters completely moved me. I recommend to anyone. It is worth the time. I want to read the book to have a better understanding of the characters.
5,TV access,We enjoyed this first episode of Birdsong that we had somehow missed. We were happy that we could get it through Amazon.
4,Can't go wrong with Masterpiece,"You can't go wrong with any production by Masterpiece on PBS. It's better than watching the mind -numbing television offered by network tv. This production is well done - with wonderful acting by some great young actors - especially Eddie Redmayne and Joseph Mawle. And of course, Marie Josee Croze. You may remember her from ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."" If you enjoy period pieces, costume drama and a love story set against the backdrop of the First World War, then this movie is a must see.But be aware, there are some difficult war scenes. I enjoyed it enough to buy it."
4,lovely story,"Really liked this movie, great acting. I read the book a long time ago and loved to see it come to life."
4,Birdsong series,"I love war movie's and I love a good Love story. This was both and I enjoyed watching. Can't wait for the next season, so I can continue to watch."
3,"Boring, slow, confusing...","I couldn't wait for this DVD to end. It was confusing and slow. I almost went to sleep. Whoever wrote this needs to ""keep it simple""."
1,Rating inaccurate,The film itself is fine but I looked at the rating Amazon had listed as TV-PG and assumed that meant it was farely innocent in terms of what you see BUT about an hour in it has very explicit content. I'll be double-checking from now on
1,Love these shows,"Crappy crappy, crappy.......I love period pieces but hate this one. I was bored the entire time!! And i never get bored!!"
1,birdsong,The movie was very very slow. They wasted too much time just looking at each other. The first half was so slow that we do not plan to see it again.
5,rexroth,"this book has made me stop wasting my time with secondary new things and try to focus onthe top books. i thank rexroth for getting me to read f m ford's ""some do not..."" , a really great novel. his remarks on homer are great,and his comments make wonderful reading."
4,Bible Holiness,I pefer the King James version of the Bible but I am enjoying the scripture readings in this Bible. The wording is made plain.
5,Metal excellence yet again!,"Rob Halford and the boys return in a phenominal album that is the triumphant continuation of the Metal God's 30 year history. This album spans every style of music I have ever heard from Rob, with tracks reflective of ""Painkiller"" or Fight to songs almost as mellow as ""Last Rose of Summer."" This is a must for any metal fan. If you have ever liked anything Rob Halford has done in the past--buy this album!You also might want to check out the band's official website for incredible, rare music content not found anywhere else!"
4,Judas Who,I drive alot on the job.....and I have listened to this cd over and over again....sober and drunk.....this is a hardcore soundtrack of Life.Vocals scream and the music tears the night....buy it...
4,"Amazing, but with some reservations.....","Oh well, Halford show the new guys how metal is done. He's getting better and better with time. Also, his supporting band is owner of great technique, power and agression, all of this honed by Roy Z superb production skills.So, CRUCIBLE is really a great album. I just think it's so silly to see Halford dressed in leather in the booklet, as if to prove something, that he is the God of Metal. Well, we cannot forget how he turned his back to metal when made the horrible project TWO...Also, there's something in his new outfit that does not please me. The sound is always flat, straight-ahead, no-holds-barred metal, in the PAINKILLER vein, while Halford shwoed, in his work with Priest, that he can also be a little more subtle in his vocals approach, when he wants to,. In Halford, he pratically only uses his screaming part of his vocals. I think this is a waste of his proven potential."
4,metal god returns,the new cd crucible is a good metal cd with two bonus tracks she and fugutive and there are straight metal songs like the title track crucible to speed metal like the first video betrayal. my first listen is that nothing really jumps out at you like resurrection and the one you love to hate but after a couple of listen the cd rocks and you will not be disappointed.
2,Judas Who?,"I sometimes feel that all the Light of God is shining on one person....Halford.....Let me tell you this is the cd that breaks the mold...if you are a Priest fan ok....this cd...rules////I listened to the old live cd Unleashed In the east...then this one...His vocals are better...damn,"
4,"Resurrection Was Better, But Crucible Still Rocks Hard.","After the success of Rob Halford's 2000 masterpiece Resurrection, Rob Halford decided he would make another album with his new band. So he did. In 2002, Crucible was released. Although the songs are not as good as they were on Resurrection, they still are great. While on Resurrection sometimes the lyrics got a little corny, Crucible showcases a much heavier edge. I rated this only four stars instead of five because I think Rob should have just made another album like Resurrection, instead of going off into different musical styles. But this is by no means a bad album. In fact, I listen to it quite often. Best songs are the title track, Golgotha, She, One Will, etc. Little fact: Pat Lachman, the giutarist heard on both Halford albums, is now the singer for Damageplan. Go figure."
2,What Happened?,"Rob Halford's latest CD here is a little too dark and chuggy. The music sounds sort of like what Sevendust is doing and not on the Priest side. Each song is very different, but in a bad way. The band is trying too hard to achieve different sounds and is lacking in overall feel, making each song sound basically the same.Also, what happened to Rob's vocals?? There are barely any high notes and the production is also lacking. Rob sounds like he is singing out of a closet. I have listened to this disc quite a few times and I cannot get into it. If your going to get Halford, I recommend his first 2 discs which kick..."
2,Sacrafices Melody and good hooks for Heaviness(Big Mistake!),What it is about working with producer Roy Z.??This is the second time a great artist who has worked with him has released a very disappointing follow up to a excellent debut!It happened with Bruce Dickinson and now with Rob Halford..I realize an artist doesn't want to make the same cd over and over again but to do a complete 180 and go in the exact opposite direction from brillant to mediocre blows my mind!!I can only guess that they(the artist) are listening to Roy Z. too much.Both follow up CD's by Dickinson and Halford try to be TOO HEAVY and to me totally miss the mark because of it.
2,The Metal God is too metallic,"""Crucible"" isn't by far as good as the previous album ""Resurrection"". On ""Resurrection"" Halford got back to the same kind of heavy metal that he was making with Judas Priest on excellent albums as ""British steel"" and ""Screaming for vengeance"". This latest efford is more metallic and I miss the melodies I know Halford is capable of. And although the album contains some real fast tracks like ""Betrayal"" and ""Wrath of God"" the overall impression is that it's a slow heavy album with simularities to Dio's ""Strange highways"". I'm not impressed by the guitar work, and I was hoping for a different approach from the Metal God. The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is that you can find some tendency to more classic heavy metal on ""One will""."
4,"Halford, halford, halford....","Il metal god è tornato, dopo il buonissimo ""Resurrection"", con un album pronto a frantumarvi le orecchie. Chi si aspettava un ridimensionamento del suono di Halford in seguito ad alcuni episodi più introspettivi di Resurrection come ""Silent Scream"" rimarrà deluso, Crucible è un album molto forte, potente, dotato di un'ottima produzione, di un lavoro magistrale dietro le pelli, e di un netto miglioramento tecnico dei due axe-man. Il songwriting è adesso più maturo, anche se il lavoro per essere apprezzato a pieno necessita di svariati ascolti. Trovereti alcuni pezzi che attingono a piene mani dal classico metal americano, altre che riporteranno alla mente suoni tipicamente nu-metal. Il grande Halfors dopo 30 anni di attività dimostra di non aver ancora perso un colpo, e sfoggia un prova di altissimo livello! Che dire... Compratelo, non ne rimarrete delusi!"
3,halford is awsome,the songs on this cd are great. the sound is not perfect but i still recommend buying this cd. unfortunately the copy i received the last 3 songs will not play. i plan on buying the remastered version.
2,Definitely inferior to Ressurection,"CRUCIBLE, altough a strong heavy metal album, is definitely inferior to Ressurection and the great Live Insurrection.The trouble here is that's all about the same tá'ta'ta, héhéhé, cliched heavy metal, devoid of the pure energy of the first release by this line-up.Well, maybe I'm just in a bad mood."
5,There is Only One Metal God!!!!,"This Cd plain and simple, Kicks Butt!!!! If you liked Resurrection, you will definately love this latest offering from the Metal God. The CD has a great sound to it and the band is in absolute top notch form. Songs Like Crucible, Betrayal, Golgotha,Hearts of Darkness,She and Weaving Sorrow just come right out at you. I have been a Priest/Halford fan for over 20 years and I must say that the MeTal God certainly has given his legion of fans something really good. Rob Halford has been and always will be the BEST MeTal vocalist, PERIOD!!!! His range can still break windows and he has been doing it for 30 years now.I cant wait to see HALFORD and his Mighty Crew live when they hit New York!!!"
4,"A Decent CD, But Most Of It Isn't That Great","I recently purchased Crucible and found that it did not live up to my expectations. First of all, the only good songs are really ""One Will"", ""Betrayal"", ""Handing Out Bullets"" and ""Wrath Of God"". The other songs just aren't thrash. Second, the whole CD has a lack of rhyming in the lyrics. This CD may have songs that quailify as thrash, but the lyrics barely ever rhyme. Its an okay CD, good if you're into Priest or Halford, but otherwise go for something more consitently thrash like Metallica."
3,"I can hear music, but I can also hear gears...","We bought one of those FM transmitters for our iPod. The transmit power was quite weak, so we thought we'd give the tape solution a shot. This one is definitely better than the FM transmitter. With the cassette adapter, we don't have to put the volume on the iPod or the stereo as loud as we would with the transmitter.The gears on the cassette adapter are pretty loud. When the iPod is at a reasonable volume, the adapter noise is very noticeable."
1,"Wait, I take it all back -- it stinks!","I wrote a positive review (under the name ""Skeptic"") of the Phillips Cassette Adapter in early February 2007, shortly after trying it out. ""So far, so good,"" I said cautiously. Well, cancel that recommendation. Within a couple of weeks the item began to malfunction -- what I can only describe as toggling back and forth, from tape-forward to tape-backward, repeated several times -- so that music or talk from my iPod would be interrupted every few minutes by a series of clicks and silences. Then, less than a month later, the thing failed entirely; each time I insert it into my car's cassette player, the player simply ejects it. // Okay, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to buy so cheap a model. I'm now going to try something a little more up-market."
1,Cheap Product!,"This adapter seems pretty cheaply made. No matter which stereo I use it with, the music only comes out of the right speaker, so music with a lot of panning sounds pretty bad. I'd go with a pricier model next time."
2,Disappointed,The zoom lens was useless - too much chromatic aberration.The wide angle lens didn't widen my scope by much but I liked being able to focus on things that were closer than what the S3 IS normally allowed. (In regular or normal macro modes).The macro lens feature was reasonable but distortion and again - chromatic aberration were noticeable and thus a problem.Don't buy.
2,Not so good a deal,I returned the Telephoto lens because it did not give me any extra power than my Canon 1.5X Telephoto lens. The worst thing is that it is very bad at night. Moon close ups were very shady and unclear whereas I am used to taking crystal clear pics of the moon without the lens. The Wide-angle lens shows dark sides when zoomed till the end unfortunatley.I kept the remaining of the set becaue I needed a cleaning kit and because their Macro lens is good.
2,Bad Decision,"I wanted to try out some lenses to try to expand the capabilities of my S3 camera and thought this might be a good deal. Well, I was wrong! The telephoto lenses was next to useless. The whole thing was cumbersome to use and I doubt if I'll ever use it."
3,Grainy,"The wide angle served its purpose, but the telephoto increased distortion by leaps and bounds. I don't recommend the 2x, go with a true Canon product. If quality of the photo isn't that great of importance to you, then it is a good deal."
4,YOUR DUTY AS A POET,"It's your duty as a poet to speak the world into a new existence! Hurray! This anthology is packed with inspiring essays and fueled with Ms. Waldmans passion for ""keeping the world safe for poetry"". Be inspired!"
2,Half of Book lacks DIRECTION and INTEREST!!!!,"In the first half of this documentary of a family's trip to India, Blaise paints an anti-feminist and harsh perpective of his wife's Indian heritage. At first compassionate, Blaise soon loses his readers with his inattention to plot and chronology. His story jumps from his time with his family in Bombay to Calcutta and the present with almost no transitioning explanation while his use of Indian words unknown to his reader are not clarified.If Mukherjee had written this book entirely, readers' interest may not have wandered as far. Bharati's interpretation of their journey is nostalgic and whimsical at the same time, telling of her return to India after a fourteen-year absence. She often visites the idea of what if; for example, what if she'd stayed behind in India and married an Indian? What if she'd led the traditional Indian life?I feel a bit sorry for her story being the secondary plot in this otherwise difficult book."
2,Disappointed,We already owned this series and we were looking to expand our set. They have really reduced the quality of the silverware. Very thin and cheap. Sad to see the quality diminish. Maybe it wouldn't seem so bad if I hadnt ever used the original quality silverware.
1,Emotionally draining,"This is the first book of A. S. Byatt that I have read. I have only read half-way through, and was so frustrated that I wanted to read some other people's thoughts on this book. The book could be very interesting if it were not for SO MANY philisopical, and religious arguments the characters have between eachother and themselves, in much too much detail. Additionally, it is a very bleak book thus far, and I am not interested enough to continue. I have purchased POSSESION, and honestly do not look forward to reading it, if this book is any indication of what I have to look forward to."
4,An engaging read,"Although it's some years since I read this excellent book, the reviews thus far in my view, do not do it justice. Many people know of Byatt's writing through her book ""Possession"" but although this is a fine example of her work, all her writing demonstrates a wonderful story-telling ability, embroidered throughout by her extensive literary and historic knowledge. ""The Game"" is a very ""readable"" novel, drawing the reader in as the tale evolves. To over analyze ""The Game"" is to miss the beauty of the mystery and intrigue; to miss the interplay between the main characters and the complexities of family emotions. ""The Game"" is a wonderful book for any mystery-loving reader and for anyone who has not already been drawn in by Byatt's writing is an excellent place to begin a reading relationship with her work."
3,"Definitely Not ""Possession...""","Like [others], I, too was disappointed somewhat with The Game. In Byatt's other work, her characters seem more fully developed and their problems seem more real. In this work, Julia and Cassandra are superficial actors of a cerebral plot, and because of this I found it difficult to care about what happened to either of them. I thought Byatt's plot had the potential to be quite intriguing; however, it was difficult to understand at times the interplay between what was actually happening in the lives of Julia and Cassandra and how they made those occurrences ""real"" for one another. I rate this book a 3 because it fades considerably when compared to Byatt's other work, most notably Possession. This is not to say that it is poorly written -- Byatt has a familiar style that carries the reader along quite nicely. The flaws here are a plot that fails to truly engage the reader and characters who do not demand the reader's sympathy."
3,Not my favorite,"A S Byatt is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not her best. Book about sisters Cassandra and Julia, and their relationship with the enigmatic Simon. Very strange characters, extremely complex, but engrossing narrative."
5,As good as it gets,I had not come across the Quartetto Italiano before which is not so surprising as these recordings were made 30 - 40 years ago. However it is a great delight to find them as their playing delightfully taut and energetic. Maybe the tempo is a little slower than expected in the Andante of the G major quartet but it still brings out some wonderful highlights.It would be surprising to find a btter recording anywhere.Phil Rowe
3,"Flawed ""Death and the Maiden""","I am surprised that Alan Lekan (""Legendary Italians"" 5/31/05) is the only reviewer to comment on the ""booming"" or thumping sound that appears throughout quartet number 14 regardless of the quality of playback equipment. Although the performances are outstanding Philips should never have released this recording, or at least not without a warning. Recommended purchase only to those who have other versions of #14."
1,LAME LAME LAME,"This video doesn't really give much instruction. I got annoyed listening to the ""luthier"" guy who wasn't exactly well spoken. Save your $, bail on this one!"
4,A long time music listner of the Moffats.,"I have been listening to this group since their cd called just ""the Moffats"". I think for a young group they have more talent than a lot of other young brother groups, like the Hansons."
4,moffats are the best!!!!,"this album is good but the best song of all is MOFFATS ""i miss you like crazy"" i love this song it's so beautiful keep on the good working guys!!!!"
2,STICK TO WHAT WORKS!!!,"I have been a Queensryche fan from the early years. I knew this album would be different, and I purchased it with an open mind to expect something else, and believe me it was! Sadly to say, I wasn't impressed. Geoff seems to be trying to reinvent himself on this cd. It doesn't work, stick with what does, PLEASE!"
4,In one word: refreshing,"I bought this CD solely based on the Amazon reviews from other customers and now that I have it I must say I agree with them on most parts.This is no Queensryche and Thank god it aint because since Empire I havent cared much for their work. I dont even compare it with Silent Lucidity for that matter. It is just a creative experience as described by Geoff in the liner notes.It gets four stars because it does not have, in my opinion that killer track that would make a great single. It is very consistent though in all its pieces. Then again, this album probably, in Geoff's mind was never intended to have that catchy single kind of song.This is Geoff Tate's personal treasure made not for hard rock fans, not for heavy metal fans, but for Geoff Tate fans. If you qualify, then BUY IT."
2,Why???,"I really don't know what to think of this album. I listended to it about 6 or 7 times already, but never get thru the entire track list and...sorry, up until tody never bought it.I'm a huge Queensrche fan and was waiting for a solo outcome after I saw the unplugged sessions. Geoff's vocals can do so much more than what he let's us hear with Q. Therefore I expected so much more I guess. Instead I get a 'flat' Tate, not using his potential. It's not that the songs are too soft or not Q-like enough (actually good, or he wouldn't have to go solo), but to me there is really not much there. Maybe somewhat more variety next time, a little more experimenting with different styles, a little 'risk' now and then, ...??"
2,"A Weak Album Saved Only By Tate's Vocal Gifts,","First, what this album IS NOT: It IS NOT metal, and it barely falls into the category of hard rock. I almost want to classify it as R&B;/New Age, but it doesn't really work there, either.As to the music itself: the instrumentals are weak in the ""traditional rock"" sense, so don't expect the old Queensryche guitar solos on this album. The instruments work to emphasize Tate's voice, and are pretty simplistic in their play styles. Most of the songs themselves seem to lack spirit, but are rendered decently by Tate's melodic voice.I probably wouldn't have purchased this album if I wasn't a QR fan, and I'd recommend ""new"" fans pick up Queensryche's _Empire_ or _Live Evolution_ rather than this album. Still, track three (""Helpless"") and track eight (""A Passenger"") are pretty good, and track five (""Every Move We Make"") is solid once you get over that annoying beep."
2,You've must be joking........,"As a diehard QR fan, I was elated to see this solo effort from Geoff Tate. With trembling hands, I opened the CD, placed it in the player, and prepared to be rocked. After the first track, I checked the CD to make sure that this really was Geoff Tate. What a disappointment! I have tried to listen to the entire CD, but it is just too painful. This is ""Queensryche Lite"" at it's worst!! Unfortunately, this same musical style has spread to the latest QR album ""Tribe"". The disco/techno-dance/ethnic rythmn sound just doesn't work! This CD leaves you with the same uncomfortable feeling you would get if you listened to Bing Crosby singing Metallica! I was really hoping for something akin to the old QR, but it was not to be. Sometimes evolution produces some weird mutations that really must be weeded out of the gene pool. This CD is one of those mutations!!!! Come on Geoff, ROCK ME!!!!!"
1,sorry Geoff,"I love Geoff Tate and the boys of Queensryche......been following their career since there're very first concert, but in all honesty i cant give this album a good review. I know that Geoff is probalby trying a whole new thing from what the band has done in the past.I guess what i am trying to say is if you are hardcore into queensryche you might not like this album."
5,Different is good!,"Geoff Tate has the best set of pipes in the business. QR happens to be my favorite band, but I also like to listen to more adult contemporary stuff while working in my home office, etc.I bought this CD with an open mind, and with the exception of the instant hit ""Helpless"", I didn't care for it at first. I have had the disc since 6/25, and now you will have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands to get it away from me. After 4 or 5 rotations of the complete disc, the nuances and beauty of this compilation have come to life.Get it for yourself, get it for your mom, your spouse or significant other, get it it for your younger brother...there is something here for everyone. It is definitely different, but like the commercial says ""Different is good"". In this case, it's great.~The eEditor~"

2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD hoping that it would be a resurrection of the sound that the old Geoff Tate/Queensryche used to produce say about 4 albums ago, and was dissapointed.I figured that the effort wouldn't be as hard or metal as the old Queensryche, but even the vocal range that GT used to demonstrate in the past wasn't there. As a result, I felt the album was slow and boring for the most part. It's as if Geoff Tate has redefined himself......as a lounge singer.Don't get me wrong - there's probably one or two salvageable songs (namely Passenger), and I think there are moments where he still sounds pretty darn good. It's just that I think he has (or had) the best voice in the business, and I don't feel that it's showcased at all on this cd."
4,Correction,"Sorry, in my previous review I said Queensryche's Rage against the Machine when I meant to reference Rage for Order.S."
1,Is not compatible with the CD-RW format!,"I purchased this item for Amazon's description included """"Audio CD-R/CD-RW playback compatibility"". That is simply not true! I recorded CD-RW's using various techniques and this unit did not recognize any of them. This is clearly ""misleading"" advertising in my opinion."
2,Good but noisy!,"It's a very good boombox for a small party or work place, but if you use it with headphone or put it at your nightstand, you will hear noise that I personally can't accept. I bought it twice but had to return it after I heard the noise. You don't have to believe me but try it with your headphone when you go buy it in the store. I compared it with many other boomboxes or mini-systems and didn't hear the noise."
5,Honestly... 5 stars,"Though very large and somewhat heavy, it plays with power and accuracy. The remote is a godsend. I originally was shopping for one athts plays MP3's and got confused with about 10 webpages open and I ordered this by mistake. I'm not happy with my shopping skills, but the music ROCKS! All that space and no nook for the remote or even a second CD It's Huge Heavy and POWERFUL!"
2,"It worked ok, but","The eye is only on one side, I expected it to be on both, I would not have bought if I'd known this."
2,One-sided and flips around in the wind,"I have a problem with turkey vultures perching on my deck. I put a diverter about every 10 feet on my deck rails. The eye pattern is on only one side, so when the wind blows it can turn it around and it no longer faces out and is useless. I guess I will try drilling a hole in the bottom and secure it on both top and bottom so it won't flip. But I think you still want it to move some to flash the sun. In any case, the turkey vultures are back about as often as before so I don't think this is working well. I'm going to try the reflective tape next."
3,it's ok,"These reflectors scared away birds from my balcony for a week or two, but the birds got used to them and returned. The only thing I found that could keep them away was an ultrasonic bird repellent device."
2,Birds land right next to the hanging eyes!,"Have hundreds of swallows at my lake house so hung these on railings where birds roost and poop! The birdsland right next to the ""eyes"" and are not bothered by them at all!"
1,weak design,"Ran 10 of the Bird-B-Gone diverters from the top of the mast of my sailboat, 5 forward and 5 aft, and after one week returned to find 7 had fallen off, 3 due to the undersized swivel breaking, and 4 because the swivels had worked their way off of the cotter ring. I'd recommend they increase the size of the swivel and that's what I'll do as a retrofit on the 5 remaining diverters ( 2 of the 7 that came off managed to land on the boat not the water)"
1,Didn't Work For Me!,Product is supposed to scare birds away. There is a bird that tries to fly into one particular window (see his reflection?) and wakes my son up every morning. The first day this was up....the bird knocked it down! He flew into it the second day (and knocked it down) too. Maybe it wasn't swiveling enough in the wind.....but it didn't work for me!
2,Finicky,"It's tough to position. The wind easily moves it out of axis. In bright sunlight the reflection probably works a little, but in general use it didn't work for us at all."
1,Didn't work for House Sparrows,"We tried this product along with the flash tape however it did not scare the House Sparrows. We wanted to keep them away from our chicken coop and patio, but it did not work. Maybe other breeds of wild birds would be scared, but not the sparrows."
3,worked great for a couple weeks...,"and then, well... the birds were unconcerned with this one time intimidating eyeball, and went back about the business of pooping on my deck furniture."
1,Humans are dumber than birds,"Even though these scarers are specifically mentioned in Cornell University's publication ""Bye Bye Birdie -Bird Management Strategies for Small Fruit"" they do not work. Birds do not seem to be bothered at all by them. Buy them only if you have nothing else to do with your money."
1,Don't Work,Hung them outside our open-front business to keep the birds out. Birds fly right by and inside w/o hesitation.
3,Works for Palm Tungsten T3,"No surprises here. Only issue I have is how loose the connection is, as it often takes some wrangling to connect properly, a problem that seems inherent to the design of this type of charger. I have two car chargers and a usb dock that all suffer from a loose connection. I've spent some time cleaning and tweaking the bend of the connectors with little success. This specific product is of decent quality and is still very much worth purchasing."
4,One of My Favorite Chantelle Bras!,"Back when I was 36DD (36E in French sizing), this was one of my favorite bras because it's practical and sexy. One advantage to this bra, if one is a larger size, is that it's molded, but it doesn't have any type of padding, so one doesn't have to look like a larger size than one already is. Recommended to anyone that wants shape without adding size, though if one is on the smaller side, since it would give good support, it would make one look larger than with an average bra. (Note that the bra is French sized, so the bra band is a lot shorter and the cups are larger/fuller than with average American bras.)"
2,Just isn't the right mix for me,"have used other yohimbe products, for some reason this one makes my heart go crazy and gives me the chills like I've got the flu. Might work for someone else but I can't really use it."
2,"Effective, but...","You can definitely feel an effect from this stuff... but for me, it was not desirable. I felt jumpy and anxious, with a knot in my stomach; it makes me feel hot, then cold... like I'm having menopause or something. Made it hard for my eyes to focus, and sometimes the things I would look at would ""crawl"". Didn't really give me ""energy"" to work out or get chores done, but it did prevent me from sleeping. Often touted as increasing sex drive, I noticed no increase in sexual function. Maybe it affects different people in different ways, but it definitely does something."
4,Great Stuff,"Great Stuff, but should only be taken in short durations or your body will get used to the dose. Once in a while for me."
2,Makes me Sick,Good energy boost but man does it make me sick.. vomitted 3 times on this stuff.. quite disappointed but it does at least give you a better boner
2,nope,"please stop saying fuel suggesting it will go somewhere .no change in libido or appetite nor energy level.just sweat and jitters,also dangerous change in blood pressure which you warn of."
4,Great stuff to learn in here!,This book is so helpful and wonderful. I bought two and gave one to my daughter who has just gotten married and she loved it too. A must-read for people to need to get straight with their financial planning!
1,Disappointing,Franco Corelli is a much better singer and his cd is so much better than this one. I own both of them. Skip this one. Jose Carreras doesn't have the power needed for this role.
4,"A Great, yet slow movie","All in all I think this movie was good. The plot was interesting, the dubbing was good. The animation was outstanding. My only problem was, it was slow at some parts, and some times left me tapping my foot waiting for the story to hurry along."
4,Excellent movie,"Of course, it is a great movie. I received it on time as expected, and in great condition. Unexpectedly, this is now the second bluray I have which is in a thin box... Just looks odd on the shelf now"
4,"Pleased, indeed!","Arrived quickly, and other than the packaging being being cracked (it's plastic, so it's bound to happen from time to time) the Blu-Ray disc is perfect! And Cowboy Bebop still stands as one of the most entertaining and spellbinding anime's of all time!Good deal. Great service, too!"
5,"Cowboy Bebop, Best Movie ever","just like the title of this letter says, this movie, Cowboy Bebop the movie, is the best movie ever. I have never seen a better anime or manga alike. This serries is so unique that nothing will ever be able to compare to it. The story and plot line is unbeatable and the characters are so real. If youv'e seen the series, you know what i mean. So if you love anime BUY THIS ONE. You'll love it.Charles BleischP.S. only one movie that comes close, Princess Mononoke."
2,"I love Cowboy Bebop, I hate this movie","I really love Cowboy Bebop, it's in like my top 10 favorite animes and I've watched a lot of animes. But I really don't like this movie, it doesn't fit the feel of Cowboy Bebop, the new characters are uninteresting, and really they just didn't take advantage of the full movie format. The UMD itself is fine, menus are nice, etc, but I just don't like this movie, sorry."
4,An Anime Worth A Buy,"Now im a big fan of anime. as a wishful otaku, i wanted to see this movie, because its on (a certain channel) all the freakin time, so i watched it, and despite a minor audio problem it was an overall good movie. i watch animes for their intriuging and deep plots, along with detailed backrounds, and charecter design. though sometimes they lose there glamour when translated to english, i really dont care. this is a good anime for all those who like movies( not specificly anime), it is a lot better than some other animes( hint, hint nija scroll), but is a definete must see, especially to those looking forward to the new cowboy bebop video game"
5,Great movie!!!,"Yes, finally new bebop material after all these years. Basically this is just like a long bebop episode with a few exceptions. Now when I say Long episode, I say it out of respect and not in any sort of deragotory way. The show itself is probably my favorite example of anime and this movie just reminds me why. Very stylistic and very ""bebop"", the movie has more action than any of the bebop episodes and plenty of romp for your pomp (...). The only part I found a bit iffy was the opening scene and early parts of the movie felt a bit gimmcky but I got over it and felt the movie was great. So if you like bebop then this is an essential exprience."
5,bebop is back; until the revamp manga makes it to television,I still dont know about CB: Stardust other then the story begins all over again with new twists. But until that great release get the series 7-disc collection not the 3 disc horrid import and see this film and buy the probably lacking dvd that will still be sharp and cool as... bebop.
5,Awsomness Immeasurable!,"Before I begin this review I must say how perfect Shinichiro Watanabe and all the folks at Studio Bones for all there hard work. I would also like to thank whoever brought this fine movie to the states to be more appreciated. This movie like many Anime movies has no real importance to the storyline of Cowboy Bebop so you can pretty much watch this without spoiling the bebop plot. This movie was very well made and the fights scenes (particullarily between Spike and Vincent and Spike and Electra) are very good, perhaps as good as The Matrix or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. All in all the movie kicks but.""It's just... a dream."""
1,Underwhelming Blu ray for a great movie,"I do not recommend getting this movie on Blu ray. I love this movie, and the video transfer is not that bad. However, the audio tracks are 2.0 PCM stereo. In other words, the DVD has better audio tracks than the Blu ray release. There are also no bonus features at all. You'd be better off sticking with the DVD. At the price I got it for, it's not worth returning, but this is a warning to all Cowboy Bebop fans. Hopefully, this movie will get a proper release sometime in the near future."
4,"Pretty good movie for a non-cbbb fan, Great movie for a fan!","Personally, I liked the movie. But I've also seen all of the episodes, which helps you understand a lot. The movie Doesn't introduce the charaters, so if you've never seen the show before you'll kind of be like, ""Who are these people? Why is the dog smarter then all of them, why does the chic in yellow look like a [prostitute], why is the little girl look and act like she stuck her finger in a light shock-it?, etc. etc."" All in all it was a pretty good movie. I rated it with a 4 for two reasons. 1) Im a huge fan, the music rocked, and cool special features. 2) LIke I said, it was a pretty good movie, but really didn't feel like a movie, just like a long episode of the show or something.Another really cool thing about this movie is that you can find it at almost every Wal*Mart. So if your not big on ordering off the internet, or just can't wait that long, its a plus."
4,bebop: the movie,"the year is 2071 and takes place on the redplanet mars.the crew of the bebop are broke anddesperate like always. the movie starts offwith spike and the bebops owner jet collecting a bountyon some small time crooks. then the movie actually starts.after the intro faye valentine is on her way back fromthe horse races when she is assigned the task of roundingup some hacker named lee samson. she finds his truck he isdriving only to discover that he isnt driving the truck!the driver exits and then the truck explodes, thus releasing adeadly virus and a 300,000,000 woolong reward for the onesresponsible. all in all this is a great movie and anyonewho is a fan of the tv serious will appreciate this flick."
4,mkay,good asdf dfei didms sjd jllk kkja ajf sjw ajak aakdjddh dhdjjDAfadfsdf dasfan J jags akwf askj jn jn s
5,kicked major butt!!!,"Cowboybebop os at it again, spike,jet,faye, and my 2 favorites, ed and ein, when a bad ass terroists threatens to kill everyone it is up the bounty hunters to save the day! don't want to tell all, cuz i would be telling everything, you have to watch it!!!"
5,THE Best,"why i think its the best is because of the fight sceen at the end between spike an vincent. that was my favorite part because you could tell they put a lot of hard work into that one scene.if you are a big cowbody bebop fan i would not stop and think before i buy this movie, it's worth every cent."
5,"Surprisingly, it's just as good as the series.","If you haven't seen the series yet, shame on you. I feel pretty confident when I say that the original series was one of the greatest artistic accomplishments of the last decade."
4,The Real Folk Anime,"If all you've seen of ""anime"" so far is Miyazaki stuff like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, then please *rent Cowboy Bebop""!Because until you've BeBoped, you haven't seen anime.Cowboy Bebop is the *real folk anime*. Dark, mysterious, adult-oriented. Full of hip references, angst, alienation, action, and wit. Bebop is what ""Minority Opinion"" or ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" would be if we weren't dependent on over-rated twits like Tom Cruise or Geena Davis.*Of course* Bebop is escapism, but it's flawless-diamond-sharp escapism that satisfies the Spiderman fan in all of us.Put down that overpriced ""director's cut"" of the Matrix and pick up this film! See how Mars, the Eiffel Tower, Morocco, nanotechnology, ramen noodles, John Wayne, kung fu, WWII torpedo bombers, and a girl named Ed fit into an interplanetary future.Nits: Me Cowboy Bebop junkie. Me expect ""Tank"" at beginning and ""The Real Folk Blues"" at the end. Wat hoppen?"
3,A must-have for fans of noir anime; worth a look for others,"The world of Cowboy Beebop is characterized by dark and gritty stories with the occasional comedic beat, and this movie is no exception. Expect the usual dose of noir and jazz with the guns n' knuckles action that are the series' hallmark. For those who like jazz and noir (and judging by the solid Cowboy Beebop fan base, there are plenty for whom this is a key selling point), this movie easily climbs into 5 star territory.At the risk of ticking off the Cowboy Beebob fan base, I frankly didn't like the music, and noir films are the cure for insomnia when it comes to dialogue sequences. The story is of fairly average quality, but it's the aforementioned action that pulls this movie into solid 3 star territory despite my own personal dislike of its other elements."
4,Newcomer likes this one,"I'm a relative newcomer to the world of Japanese animation. Cowboy Bebop was on my list and I was not dissapointed. I have never seen the series so I cannot judge on the differences or likenesses.The story is as often ten times better than American animations. This time it's a bounty hunt for a man who wants to destroy the world, which in this case is Mars.The choise of music is fun, some country/western and other English language pop songs (I always watch the anime movies in Japanese with subtitles and the animations of course perfect. Sometimes it reminded me of The Matrix because of the fighting scenes and camera angles. The young hacker Ed is the funniest character because of her speech and movement.Worthwile!"
4,"Must for CB fans, but is a disappointing movie on its own.","Well, what can i say, this movie is probably a huge hit with CB fans, being a big fan of CB myself, i probably liked it more so because of the fact. But as a stand alone movie by itself, it was quite disappointing.The good:- EXCELLENT ANIMATION- cool new characters electra and vincent- awesome music (buy the soundtrack!!)The bad:- the plotline has an unfinished feel to it- dosn't have much development to vincent or electra- didn't have enough content"
5,Wow. This is GOOD.,"Having never seen the TV show, we picked this movie up on the recommendation of folks who thought we'd like it. Boy, were they right! The characters are engaging, the voice dubbing is excellent (unlike so much anime), the animation is beautiful, and the music is stunning! I was especially impressed with how well plotted the story was and how emotional the ending made me. An absolute must-see."
3,I like.. but it did need to move faster.,"Frankly, I'm dissapointed with the movie. I LOVE Cowboy Bebop. I have the whole series on DVD. I felt the action scenes were superb- as usual. I also like the overall story. BUT... I felt the story could've been sped up a little bit more. For the first 45 mins of the movie, it could've been compressed into a 5 minute overview instead of having it drag. I know it creates drama with anticipation but honestly, if you watched the 2nd hour of the movie you would still understand what's going on."
