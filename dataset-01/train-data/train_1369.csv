2,Far from the Best,I got this book when i got into drawing and was disgusted to find it did'nt really help me at all. I only gave it two stars because it gives you a few examples to look at if you really need them. and if your gonna draw something more for an ADULT kind of cartoon. There was more on how to draw breasts in diffrent postions and how it'd look with diffrent hands holding it then how to draw legs and arms. combined. it's alright if your deperate. but don't waiste your money otherwise.
5,Magnifique'!,"It's a great book on drawing the female anime physique and all! Number 1! Great instructions, great illustrations!"
2,slighlty disapointing,"Some of the drawings in this book were disapointing because they look like they were made by someone who doesn't know how to draw manga. Some are sloppy, in some it is evident that they were made in less than 10 seconds. Those are mostly in the first chapter, so from the 2nd chapter until the end, the book gets much betterI would recommend it to people who are not beginners and who don't mind using liquid corrector to get rid of the less-than-satisfying drawings"
3,It's good for those that know how to draw.,"I give this book 4 stars because the tutorials are good,but they arent really the best for beginners. I recommend this book to any manga artist. This book has some nudity in it,but it's censored to keep it appropriate for teen artists."
4,SOLID!!,"Very well built machine with heavy steel stand. Much better than the comparable models on the market today. Easy to set up and adjust. The only reason I gave it four stars is it comes with a poor assembly manual, but assembly is so straightforward this is not a big problem. I have only had the machine a short time but sanding results so far have been good. Exceptionally fast stock removal. Highly recommended for the pro shop or the part time woodworker."
4,good sander,Manual is not complete. Items included were not in manual but were in the cover picture.The table tilt/ height adjustment should utilize more of the belt.The machine sands nicely.
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!,This book has tons of recipes for everyday fare that is easy to follow and very well presented. I have tons of cookbooks and rarely make more than a few of the recipes because of difficult to find ingredients or that are too exotic for my taste and I have already tried two of the recipes after only 4 days.
1,Lean for Life - Phase II,"I never received this. I ordered two of the sets of Phase I and Phase II, but I only received Phase I."
1,Should be called Pro Recording Studio design for drooling,"I bought this book for advice about improving my already successful boutique recording studio.Almost none of this book is about ""home"" studios. All the examples are of professional studios costing huge amounts of money to build. The first picture in the book even has a full-sized grand piano in it, for God's sake. And the author goes on about the lack of maths needed ... and then fills the book with a huge amount of maths data tables and formulae.It seems to me like the author was just wanting to tell all budding studio builders how wonderful he is rather than giving real, sensible, affordable advice.Sorry, but don't waste your money on this book."
4,I want to rate 4.5 stars--why can't I?,"Generally this is an informative book, I've found it very valuable and am glad I purchased it...but it does deserve a few dings. Rod assumes at least some familiarity with construction jargon. For construction illiterates like me, some of his explanations leave me wondering what he is saying and it is at least in part due to terminology I'm not familiar with. A glossary would help. I also wish he'd deal a little more with how to work around, or options for improving, existing construction, like an existing window or door you might want to keep.Overall, this book is well worth the price for the wealth of detail about materials and construction techniques alone. It will be a great reference book."
5,Essential Reading.,"I wish I had known about this book when I had my last home studio built for me! It certainly would have saved me a lot of time and money - not to mention the fact that I would have ended up with a much better studio. Don't even think about building, or getting a contractor to build something for you, without reading this book from cover to cover. It's very clearly written in non technical jargon and highlights all the major pitfalls to look out for along the way. For my new studio I'm going make sure my contractor has his own copy of this book! I'm also going to make sure my new studio is well ventilated - the guy who ""designed"" my old studio didn't think it was all that important!!??"
4,Recording Studio for the pros,As a General Contractor in the building industry it was very helpful for putting in a recording studio for a client
2,Post Modernism at its best!,"While this book did provide sufficient information on the history of Africans living in Brazil, the author fails to intelligently argue his points. This book was nothing more than a Pan-African manual that is probably passed out in meetings. Chances are, if the book is published by a dodgy publisher, it wasn't approved by credible academics. Nascimento creates his own definition of genocide. Not to say that Africans never endured hardship and atrocity in Brazil, but it is not genocide. Works like this one are dangerous because it is written to serve a political agenda instead of providing an objective truth."
3,A promising first novel from a new author,"""Tengue"" is an involving and well-plotted story. The characters are rich and well-defined and help move the brisk pace along. There's equal amounts of intrigue and action as things happen that maybe shouldn't be happening. But happen they do and if you like your stories with twists and turns, then ""Tengue"" is for you."
3,Good background; little advice for parents,Good statistical presentation of the motivation of colleges/universities in provided financial aid over the past few decades and how it is changing. Little to help parents to how to deal with a financial aid office.
1,Work ok for a short while...,"... if they were 1/3 the price of other similar bits they may be worth it to some. I run a laminate shop and we go through bunches of bits, and some didn't last 100' of countertop before scorching and losing metal. Amana and Freud are much better..."
3,A good ol' movie :),"A really cute Disney movie with the kids from Mary Poppins coming to visit their grandfather in Califonia. during their picnic in the woods they find a gnome who is in trouble. All sorts of trouble ensues as they try to help the gnome, including kidnappings and car chases!"
1,"Me Johnson Car = Good, Pan-n-Scan = BAD!","If I could stop singing ""Me Johnson Car"" for one moment, I would complain about the horrid pan-and-scan look of this movie...but I can't! ""Me Johnson Car"" is among the top Disney songs ever written, sung or produced and I'm very disappointed that a) no one in the Disney stores knows it when I sing it and b) it's not on ANY of the Disney song compilations.Long Live Me Johnson Car!"
4,better then i expected,My wife wanted to purchase this movie for our child since she had watched it over and over again when she was a kid. Much to my suprise it was actually an entertaining movie. Obviously since its so old it did give us a few laughs at what they considered special effects. the little gnomes didn't always look so little.
4,"Fun and light-hearted, full of memories!","This is a family favorite and one I owned on VHS (home-recorded) but wanted to update to a DVD version. A look back to those innocent days of childhood when magic and mythology were able to merge more easily in our lives. The story is fun, has some scenes of suspense from a child perspective (for the time it was made) and a happy ending, to boot!"
3,Silly but Fun,"While DJ Mulrooney is picnicking in the woods with his grandchildren, his granddaughter discovers a couple of gnomes living there, who think they are the only gnomes left in the world. JC agrees to help them find other gnomes and all kinds of complications ensue, including stolen gnomes, a stay in and escape from an insane asylum, car chases and a race to catch a ""greased"" gnome.The Gnome-Mobile is a typical Disney Film from the `60's - silly but lots of fun to watch. Walter Brennan is great as both DJ and one of the gnomes, while Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (listed in the credits as the kids from Mary Poppins) are okay as his grandchildren. It's fun spotting the character actors who seem to appear in just about every comedy made in the 60's including Richard Deacon, Frank Cady, Ellen Corby and Charles Lane. Ed Wynn appears all to briefly as a gnome.The Gnome-Mobile is a good, fun family film."
5,Ageless entertainment for all ages,"This is a wonderful movie from long ago as my granddaughter said. I do not know who enjoyed the movie more, my granddaughter or myself. It is excellent entertainment for the entire family. I recommend this movie for everyone. It was truly amazing, no violence, no killing and it can still hold your attention through the entire movie. Call me old fashion, but more children need to see the movies we saw as children.The quality was excellent and Walter Brennan actually looked ""younger"".Aspasia"
1,5 stars for the Movie 1 Star for No Widecreen DVD!,"I love the Gnome Mobile which stars the Mary Poppins kids, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber and as much as I like Mary Poppins I have to admit that I actually like The Gnome Mobile better! But why is the Disney company only making fullscreen DVDs and refusing to put out a widescreen DVD? Don't they care about their fans and customers anymore? Or have they just become a bunch of greedy meanies who put profit over quality!"
1,Disney is disapointing,"I will pass on this one and all the other Disney DVDs until they do it right, not until I get the full aspect ratios of their films on WIDESCREEN will I purchase any."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, fun, with a moral to it!! Looked for this movie for 10 years and I finally found it here!!"
1,"I love old Disney movies, but...","I do enjoy the old Disney classics I remember as a kid. I've been trying to indoctrinate my children with these classics too. ""The Gnome Mobile"" was frankly one of those stories that just disappoints. I couldn't remember it from my youth, so it was a gamble. My kids yawned all the way through it - there's really not much of a story line to it. Thank goodness for Amazon Instant Video though - makes these bummer movies not so bad - cheap price and convenience makes everything go down a bit easier."
5,"Explosive movie, Special Features are a Dud!!","I am partial to this movie and that is why I'm giving it five stars. If you like Darby O'Gill and the Little People as I do, you'll love this film. The falure of this DVD lies in it's lack of Special Features, and I would be living in a dream world if I ever thought disney would give us a better release of this movie, because the simple fact of the matter is that it's not going to happen, but hey at least we got it on DVD."
1,Pan & Scan blues,"I love this movie and would rate it 4 stars, except that this DVD is yet another example Disney's lamentable tradition of releasing most of its live action films in pan and scan instead of in the original widescreen format.Since I don't really want to buy the film twice, I will pass on this edition and patiently wait until Disney sees fit to do a proper release of this great family film."
3,This Is A Cute Movie But The DVD Lacks A Widescreen Edition!,"The Gnome Mobile is a cute movie and stars Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber the children who played Jane and Michael Banks in Mary Poppins. They are again playing a sister and brother but this time they are named Elizabeth and Rodney who go to California to visit their wealthy grandfather D.B. Mulrooney who is played by Walter Brennen who also plays one of the gnomes who Elizabeth and Rodney discover in a forest. The Great cast also includes Ed Wynn, Richard Deacon, Ellen Corby and Tom Lowell and I highly recommend this movie! This is a 5 star movie but I'm very disappointed that it's a pan and scan DVD and not widescreen!"
5,kerrilee hall,My mother was looking for this movie around St Pattys day she watched it when she was younger and wanted to see it again and Amazozn had it. It arrived in great time and she said it was in mint condition
5,memories,I remember this movie from my childhood and was very happy when I found it here. It arived in perfect condition and played just as I rememberd. My grandkids even like it. The nothern Ca. redwoods are my favorite place (that is where it was filmed)and old Rolls Royse cars are my favorite old car (that is what the gnome moblie is).
4,The Gnome Mobile.,My Husband saw this movie when he was younger and we had the VHS Movie and I was looking for the DVD and found iton your site after looking all over for it. This will be a keep sake for years.
2,Like a million little gnats buzzing around your head,"I saw Billy Corgan performing one of his songs on a talk show and couldn't wait to order this CD. Once I got it, I quickly became annoyed with his music.All of the music on the CD is performed with too much reverb. The songs would be great if they were done in a clearer format. You know how the radio sounds when the tuning button is a few pushes from getting the station in clearly? Or stuck between two stations?Half-way through the CD my brain began to feel numb and my head hurt. All the songs began to sound like an annoying bzzzzzzz bzzzzzzzzzzz bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.Distortion effects can be terrific when used with more discretion. Billy, put the pedals away and just play the music."
2,weak - 2.5 stars,"as someone else mentioned, this also reminds me of the new NIN album. two albums by great musicians putting out mediocre stuff. i'm a huge pumpkins fan and thought this would be better. i'd rather listen to this than horrible zwan, but machina was a much better album, or anything else done by the pumpkins. apparently corgan realized the weakness of this album too, because after it was released he decided he wanted to reform the pumpkins!"
4,Hey I saw you in concert.,"Billy Corgan kicks ass, pumkins or not (altho i prefer the pumkins). I really hope he will reunite the pumpkins like he said he mite do. Seeing Jimmy Chamberlin at the concert gave me high hopes."
2,The Pumpkin's Musical Mastermind Slips into Mediocrity,"The Smashing Pumpkins were one the greatest alt-rock bands of the 1990's, entwining the angry energy of grunge with the melodrama and ""listenablility"" if you will, of alternative, boosted by Coran's underrated Hendrix-influenced guitar and Chamberlain's masterful drumming. When Corgan formed Zwan, he lost that Nirvanaeque edge that had the power behind the music. Stil left was the good music with good musicians to back it up, making them a mild success until group dissent and band politics broke them apart. But with Corgan embarking on a highly predicted/expected solo career, he lost the alt-rock edge in deference to an equivocal, electronic sound, and with half of the great musical talent gone (Chamberlain), the album is but a stale ghost of the powerful synergy Corgan had created with the Pumpkins. All in all an disappointment, though a forseeable and expected dissapointment."
2,What a surprise!,It is no wonder that Billy has announced the pumpkins will return. This album is a flop. One bright spot - the cover tune with Robert Smith.Most other tracks grate against the nerves like a really bad dentist.I was crushed by how much I dislike this album because I think Corgan is one of the best.
4,"Corgan, alone and in charge...","On the verge of hearing that Billy Corgan, and seemingly the rest of the bunch, are planning on re-grouping the Smashing Pumpkins we have Corgan's solo debut, a nice work considering Corgan's really never seemed happy as an ex-pumpkin.Yet, even with the fear of sounding too old/bald/40's/techno Corgan still shows himself to be quite skilled, even if he's got to be `solo'. Albeit some are a bit on the loopy repeating side, such as the initial song ""All Things Change"", but Corgan re-imburses himself with an excellent cover of the Bee Gee's ""To Love Somebody"", his own A100, and just many other good to quite good songs.So will the Smashing Pumpkins get together? I couldn't say, but until they do (or don't) this album should keep the music soul busy, and happy."
5,Never selling out to POP culture,This album is yet again a step in the right dirtection for an artist who is always pushing himself to be better and better...This album is by far one of Billy's best works since Mellon Collie!Go out and BUY IT! You wont be disapointed (Pumpkin fan or not)
3,Ok album,"This album is better then the last Smashing Pumpkins record, but thats not saying much. This isn't a bad album, but it's not great. I would take Zwan over this anyday. Zwan is better then this and the last Smashing Pumpkins album. I really don't think the Pumpkins should re-unite without the original lineup that made them famous."
1,I thought it sounded familiar...,Billy Corgan moving in new innovative directions? No. It sounds like an Orgy album. And that's bad.Stick with the Pumpkins.
5,Beautiful and Gentle,A beautiful work of art...not apparent on the first listen...listen to it start to finish a few times...let it get under your skin and breathe...it's not the Pumpkins...but it wasn't meant to be...it lives on its own as a solo work from the man himself.
3,First Solo Effort--Lacks Addictive Quality of Pumpkins,"As an ardent Billy Corgan fan, I found myself really wanting to love TheFutureEmbrace. Not instantly gratifying, I hoped that it would grow on me, and it really hasn't. The disk lacks the screeching guitar riffs and explosive drumming of Jimmy Chamberlaine characteristic of early Pumpkin classics like Gish and Siamese Dream. In that respect, it is more in the vein of the less critically acclaimed Adore album.Cut number 2 [Mina Loy (M.O.H.] is the one song that captures some of the magic of The Smashing Pumpkins. On its own, however, it isn't enough to carry what is otherwise a pretty forgettable listening experience."
3,Soothing Yet Familiar,"As a fan of the the Smashing Pumpkins, I feel that Billy Corgan simply cannot make it with the full band. While this album reminds me of Adore, it is lacking a quality and uniqueness that comes with the band. This album is relaxing and good for driving, I suppose, but nevermind just sitting down to listen. It's merely mediocre."
4,"Don't own the album yet, but...","For anyone interested in buying the album, go to BillyCorgan.com and click the Multimedia button. There, you can hear four complete songs at a reasonable bitrate. I've listened to all four, and it seems like a reasonable album, but certainly more techno than the Smashing Pumpkins. It's not bad though... so enjoy! Hear for yourself if you're interested in the disc.Whoever reviewed it and compared this disc to NIN's new disc, With Teeth, is on to something! This sounds like a cross between 'Adore' and 'With Teeth'.Dave"
2,colder than a witch's youknowwhat,"this album sucks...im a huge pumpkins fan, heck i can even handle 90 percent of their bsides without wanting to jump out a window, but this album is rubbish. there are exactly three good songs on here, which happens quite a bit on albums these days, but the others are almost unbearable. if u buy this cd, but it used for gods sakes...and also, i suggest taking the shoestrings from your shoes and putting away any blunt sharp objects...this album will make you want to use them by song 8."
1,Are you kidding me?!,"To be blunt, if you love Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan, you will most likely not enjoy this album. What is with all of the crappy techno melodies!? I mean, c'mon, Billy could have at least rocked it out a bit with his uniquely sounding guitar playing. What the crap! Man, I was really looking forward to this cd, what a dissapointment. *sigh"
1,Behind the music that sucks,"Billy Pumpkinhead has finally gone and done what any self-congratulatory '90s has-been does; released a solo album of more whiny, self-indulgent noise. It was bad enough when ol' baldy wouldn't go away and join a Buddist temple or something, but the pompous pumpkin insists on annoying anyone within earshot with his shrill so-called ""singing"". See Billy shave his head so he can be ""trendy"". See Billy pose stupidly for cover picture. Hear Bald Billy Pumpkin destroy a perfectly good Bee Gees song ""To Love Somebody"". See reviewer reach for barf bag."
2,it sucks,"I wasn't trying to compare it to the pumpkins but man this sucks. Even his lyrics aren't as good as everyone says they are. Get real people, all I hear is ""the cure"" rip off here."
2,Track list is not correct.,The tracks listed on the picture of the disk do not match the track list at the bottom of the ad. Some of the songs are the same but not all. Make sure you confirm the actual songs.
1,A dry and uncritical introduction,"Zahlan covers the history of the Gulf states with special emphasis on the history of the various monarchical families. Sadly, her attitude is unflinchingly fawning; she seems afraid to say one negative thing about these countries and their economic and political challenges. As well, the writing style is very dry and wooden. Her bias is symbolized by one of the maps showing the UAE as extending westward all the way to Dawhat as Salwa, at the southwest base of Qatar. This reflects absurdly ambitious territorial claims of the UAE at a time when the Saudis have claimed the coast in the vicinity of Khawr Duwayhin, southeast of Qatar. This map is emblematic of the book's flaws. A much better book despite its age (1980) is 'Arabia, the Gulf, & the West' by J.B. Kelly."
3,Easy and neutral,"I purchased this book for a graduate course on the Arab gulf states. It was used as an introductory book to read. I enjoined it because it was an easy read. However I was a little bit frustrated because I felt the author was trying too hard to remain objective on certain subjects like colonialism and rentierism, etc. This seemed to cause the author to gloss over certain subjects. Where rather than being objective she could have provided a bit more detail from one angle to help understand the region."
4,"Perfect music, but absolutely poor packaging.","I love music from Savoy and Dial labels.Sound on this box is for me very good, but session with Dizzy Gillespie (February 28,1945)has more worse sound as Definitive box set.Packaging on this set is worst I ever seen.I have problems with defective disc 4 too, but Savoyjazz send me correct version (on savoyjazz is address) without problems."
3,Looks nice but did not fit !,"I had to return it. It did not fit the drain, the screw holes did not lign up for some reason !"
5,Very Beautiful,"First rate cast, all singing supurbly. Beautiful production. Kiri is spectacular, Brendel is fine as a romantic lead. McIntyre is particularly fine as the father."
4,Warning: no subtitles,If you love opera DVDs bez you can learn the opera -- music and words -- this DVD may not be for you.
2,"Sorry, wrong singer...","I was avidly browsing through the recorded evidence of *Natalie Dessay's* brilliant vocal performances --having recently heard her on a free TV arts network music CD extract. Not realizing that into Ms. Dessay's amazing recordings would be inserted [mirabile dictu] items featuring OTHER operatic personalities such as Bev Sills and Te Kanawa. So... without reading carefully, I mistakenly bought THIS version of Richard Strauss's ""Arabella."" Let this be a warning to all semi-conscious shoppers. Dessay sings Strauss inimitably.And I WILL succeed in finding the ""holy grail"" of her performance. But, woe is me! Until then, I shall haveto be content with Kanawa. Sorry, wrong singer.... And I can't blame Amazon for misleading me (I think)."
4,original score,"I got this score because the orchestra I belong to was going to play this piece and thought it'd give me a better understanding of it. This score has a clear description of each tableau and detailed stage directions whenever the mood or musical theme changes, and has been a great help for me to understand what's happening in this ballet. However, this is an original score and while very helpful as a whole, since my orchestra was playing the revised edidtion, there were many differences between them in instrumentation, sometimes in a number of measures and even time signatures, and sometimes it was very confusing. Although I was glad that I had this score while practicing this piece, I did wish if I'd gotten the revised version. Beware of the type of edition you want to read!"
3,Very good content .. very overpriced,I finished this beautiful book in about 6 hours easy reading. The info was helpful .. lots of examples of PS plugins and what they did. HOWEVER I was not thrilled to pay the money for a once read book. The content could have been put in several .PDF files and folks allowed to view or download the content for much less money.
1,desk looks great but shakey,"Nice looking desk, but not quality. The desk is not stable enough to hold the hutch. Recommend using some type of reinforcements or the desk will wobble and can even come apart. Hardware could be more durable. Takes awhile to put together. Great size for small spaces. All particle board, no real wood."
1,Broken and awful colored 'Blue Goblin',"This thing was received broken and is not the classic comic goblin. I is 'wearing' a blue and silver suit which makes the name 'green goblin' a wrong name for it. Maybe 'blue goblin' would be more appropriate. It was not worth returning so it had to be glued back together. No pumpkin bombs or loose accessories for a child of any age to play with. Can a glider or accessories be purchased separately? Who knows. As with most of these figures which break all too easily and have nothing available to make it playable, this one will be wind up posed on a desk or display to just be looked at. With that awful blue suit on, it isn't even worth the view."
5,Funny as can be,This DVD set is very funny. The writers poke fun at the many gay and lesbian stereotypes. If you need some light hearted fun this is indeed the DVD collection to watch.
4,O-M-G!,"This tv show is a riot!Nice to see that the ""community"" funny in some of the jokes!Can't wait for another season to be released!"
3,Review of Innspectors sample testing booklet,"The booklet provides a good basis for someone who is intending to become a Certified Elevator Inspector to determine areas of weakness in their knowlege and familarty with elevator related terms as well as the technical aspects of the the codes, and practices common to the everyday application of them through out the elevator industry."
4,Excellent Tape....period.,"I am a huge fan of the Twilight Zone. ""The Trade Ins"" is a mildly disturbing tale, yet good. But ""Third from the Sun is one of the series's best. Good overall episodes."
5,"If You Like The 70s,Buy This One!!","A GREAT piece of work-all 3 of the main ttle songs from the Shaft trilogy,Superfly,Three The Hard Way and more.....if you liked the blaxploitation movies of the 70s this one is a must own.I ahd much of this on vinyl when it first came out but to have it here on one pristine digital recording is wonderful.This puppy begs for a followup or two!"
4,Can you dig it?,"This is a compilation album featuring songs from '70s blaxploitation movies. It feature ten funky songs from such cinematic ""masterpieces"" asTrouble Man,The MackandFoxy Brown. The songs are performed by soul legends like The Impressions, The Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Issac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield. (There are also two songs by the obscure Willie Hutch.) This is a fun compilation, and fans of '70s soul should dig it."
2,70's memories,"I brought this cd for the price and my favorite song on the cd ""I Choose You"" played it a few times,however it started skipping on a couple of the other songs which was dissapointing because I purchased it for my family reunion that was a 70's theme.I thought it was my player but it kept skipping on other cd players as well."
4,Great Compilation,"I haven't been excited over a compilation in a while, not since the ""Babies Makin Babies"" by ?estlove. Anyway, good compilation with great songs, you can even feel the groove on ""Make a Resolution."""
5,Onyx strikes for a final time,"The third and final albulm from Onyx the kings of NY. This albulm is the best one with guest apperances by DMX, Big, Pun and Noreaga this albulm is a good way to go out."
1,I listened to it two or three times then never again,"It just didnt do it for me. I thought it was pretty weak. There's no way you can compare this album with DMX, and JayZ."
4,The album is all that and then some.,"I heard the album and thought that Onyx has made such an outstanding comeback after their first album went into sale. I hope that those n****s keep bringing it down 'cause, we, the public, is ready for them. YO, Onyx, shut 'em down, baby."
2,Three Years Use,"I've been using this planer for over three years now. The machine was an easy set-up. It's a must to have a dust collecter attached to it. After set-up I can plane lumber for about 2 hours, then it's time to ajust it again. I plane heavy oak boards that are close to 100 years old from old barns. The height ajustment will not stay locked, and the bottom rolls don't either. First time using this machine the lock screws for the bottom rollers fell out. I am not pleased with this machine at all."
1,lemon?,"I purchased this planer to be my primary planer, counting on my already owned Dewalt portable to be a back-up tool. Upon arrival, I was duly impressed by the beautiful finish and the seemingly high quality which one should expect from Powermatic. After 8 hours of running fir through the planer,I had almost the same number of hours invested in trying to tweak this thing to make it run like a $1k+ machine. In short, I am now using my little Dewalt while this potentialy great machine sits idle (the wheels in the base are great for pushing it into the corner!). I suspect that I have a lemon, but the weight of this thing makes returning it a MAJOR hassle, and packaging the machine would be a huge ordeal."
1,Plan for ADJUSTMENTS,"I would expect more from Powermatic, but what can you expect when its coming from Taiwan. After using this several times, the 3 V belts were always getting hot and smelled like burning rubber. After 3 phone calls to Powermatic and NO answers on how to solve the problem. I finally checked the motor allignment and the pulley alignment, only to find out it was off by 1"" or more, causing the belts to bind when running a long time. Also, my brother owns this same planer and he has had to replace the upper gears up/down crank handle 3 times because the castings are so bad that the gears don't mesh well and eventually wear out.My only suggestion: BUY an older planer made in the USA. We have an old Rockwell 18"" that is built like a tank and has never failed us."
3,So-so listening,"I bought this album on a whim after this artist was featured in the ""Justify Your Existence"" section of The Onion's AV Club. I wasn't sure what to expect, really.The music seems to me like the result of someone throwing lounge music and ambient techno in a blender and setting it to puree. It's pleasant enough most of the time, but it doesn't really engage my brain and it lacks the texture and substance that I like. Plus which, some of the vocal samples are downright annoying at times."
2,Not as shown in picture,"The dress is super short, it didn't even cover my butt cheecks. No exageration. Also I wear a 14-16 but bought the 1xl that states it is an 18-20, it wouldn't even zip. Yikes it's a total bust, Im sending it backh"
2,Very short!!,"They might have made this dress longer last year (as pictured) but the 2009 version is very, very short. I'm only 5'1"" and it hits about 5"" above the knees. I also had to order 4 sizes bigger than I normally wear just to get the thing zipped. I probably won't ever order another outfit from this manufacturer again."
1,watch out you don't lose your eye,"I bought this toy and used it maybe 20 times. On the last time, as I was pulling back on the band it snapped and ricocheted back hitting me in the mouth. OUCH!!!Not only should the ""go-frr fetch it ball"" have lasted longer.......it's a good thing it didn't take out my eye when it did break!Face it...it's a bad design."
2,not durable,"my lab loved it, but the sling shot thing doesnt go very farit only lasted a day with my dog until it was in shredsjust use a tennis ball"
5,Family in crisis,Great insight into a long and sometimes difficult relatonship by someone with intimate knowledge.
3,Worth getting through Season 1 for Season 2,"Season 1 of Without Motive was decent. I appreciated the portrayal of the officers as regular human beings and felt that this may be closer to what a true-life situation might be in an investigation. However, the interactions between the main character and his wife and subsequently some of the other officers seemed off and out of left field. It was so distracting that I considered dropping the show. However, as the season progressed it became more engaging and I was ready to devour Season 2."
3,Too Negative,"Too much like some of the lame police series we get on network television. If one likes adultery, back stabbing your co-workers etc they will love this show."
2,Poor water flow,"The water flow is very soft. I like a stronger stream. Other then than works well, easy to install."
2,Happy Now,"Bright brass coating is starting to discolor after only about 8 months. Spray patterns are good, but the head keeps dripping for a long time after the water is shut off. Hose twists / untwists under any amount of pressure.Additional Note. I recently contacted Alson's about the brass discoloration. They promptly sent a new hand held showerhead. None of the other parts show any discoloration. The new head drips less after turning the water off, so I'm very pleased. Excellent customer service."
5,Excellent war memoirs,I've now read all of Spike Milligan's war memoirs and think they're excellent (I'm also not a big fan of the Goons). While generally very funny you can really sense his depressive moods even at times when he's not explicit about them.
4,Whole Green Chilies,These green chilies are nice and made a great green chili dish. I only wish they would have been hot instead of mild.
3,Smallville poster...,"I bought this for a friend who is absolutely in love with Smallville/ All things Tom Welling. Overall I think she will love it, but it is a little misleading. For example the poster has a white border which it doesnt show in the picture. You can tell its a reproduction poster, but it says that. However I think any smallville fan would love this. Not a bad product for a good price!"
3,a bit dreary,"Although I enjoy technical metal, this album was just too grey and cold for me. The album seems to focus on technicality (though it is not hypertechnical, along Watchtower lines or anything) to the exclusion of engaging the listener. It was very hard to tell the songs apart. I highly recommend the followup album, however, ""Screams and Whispers,"" which was undoubtedly Anacrusis' masterpiece."
4,Nostalgic,"This picks up where the Immigrants leaves off. It continues the saga seamlessly. The audio production is unique with different actors voicing different characters, in addition to a narrator. It is a pleasant and engaging experience.Second Generation"
3,Second Generation,This book is second of a series. The first book (The Immigrants) was not available for the Kindle so you will have to find it in paper. i enjoyed this book mmore than the first because it helped the reader to better understand and care about the characters. It was an easy read.
1,Not what I expected,"These are not houses that people would build. I was very disappointed in this book. The houses pictured were only the weird modern type that most people wouldn't build. We don't want to build a standard boring ""production"" home but these were just too far out there."
4,Pretty Good,I bought a karaoke machine for my daughter and this was the first CD-G I got. It was a pretty good one. I'm not disappointed at all. I just ordered a few more CD-G's. I can't wait to get them.
3,Great idea......,"The sounds of the bugs can only be heard if the insect is on the green platform. Unfortunately, it's difficult to get the bug to cooperate, they seem to want to go anywhere but there. You must also keep the observation station completely still to hear anything. And no one else can say anything. Getting five kids to be quiet, keep the thing still, and get our detainee to comply........was a little frustrating for all the excited little people, as you can imagine. Great concept, but could be a lot better executed. The legs broke trying to put it together, and the earphones broke the first day, too. However, the kids loved it; and the potential for study and imagination is fantastic."
3,"We like it, but it can break easily","We love this device, but I wouldn't call it a toy. It really is best used under adult supervision. It is fun to listen to the bugs, but the legs that come with it snap off WAY too easily. This can mean that if you are a five year old carrying this around the house, you can easily lose your grip and the whole thing drops on the floor. Many tears as we try to collect the broken pieces of the toy and the half smashed bug which was killed during the drop.If you buy this, plan to keep it someplace special and take it down to use with your kids. Also, don't bother attaching the legs. They just come off five minutes later.That said, I plan to get it as a gift for friends. You can really hear the bugs and the magnification is some of the best I've seen in a kid's product.I'll just warn our friends about the legs and tell them not to let their kids carry it around too much."
4,big bad booming bugs station,8 Year old and 4 Year old like this item. One likes it because it keeps the bugs contained and the other because she can see the bugs. The pincher cup shaped gripper that comes with this is useless. We just trap the bugs with the container itself. Using the ear plugs and hearing the bug is fun. The downside as with many child magnifiers is that they don't magnify to the degree I would like them to. And the magnifier is only on top. It would be nice to have it on two sides as well. I didn't know the clear plastic can twist away from the base. We almost had a bug disaster (at least for the 8 year old. I have no complaints about the legs. We don't use them.
5,The end of the peace process that never really existed...,"...These essays are all excellent, and Said is one of the few people addressing the problems of the Israel/Palestine issue ... The essay about Said's visit with his son in Palestine I found particularly good. It is quite different in tone from the rest of the essays. However, it gives a very real and vivid picture ofwhat daily life is like in Palestine, and thus, why adressing the 'real' issues is so imperative."
1,Product never worked from the beginning and seller never answered emails.,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would!This product has NEVER worked in any of the 3 new computers I own, and when I emailed the seller MULTIPLE times, I never received an email back.I wouldn't refer this to anyone!"
3,"Helpful, but BE CAREFUL...","The way you enter equations and such is not really intuitive and takes some getting used to, but I finally got the hang of it. I would not use this software as my only source of information, but as an additional source to confirm and check answers or to help clarify concepts. At times, it has produced radically different answers than my textbook and MyMathLab have provided on the exact same problem. The software is a decent 3rd or 4th opinion, but I would not want my entire grade resting on the answers provided by Algebra Solved."
5,"Very helpful, Great product",Great product. I am so happy with this product. I know it will help me through my math courses. I played with it for sometime and found it to be exactly what I was looking for to help me. I would recommend this for anyone who has been out of math for sometime or needs some assistance with their homework.
1,not what I expected,"It states quick and easy too use NOT TRUE. Very time consuming and nerve wrecking to enter problems, unless you are needing help with BASIC algebra only! What's the point? I have both CD & both basically does the same. Not helpful for college math."
2,Not Seb's best effort,"Let's start out by saying that I am a HUGE Seb Fontaine fan....however, this 2 disc release left me cold. It did not have the intensity or dark feel that I have come to expect from Seb. The tracks blend monotonously into one another and not one really jumps out at you, except for ""La La Land"" (for obvious reasons). If you are new to the progressive house sounds of Seb Fontaine, just don't buy this album as your first."
5,perfecto indeed,"I have yet to listen to more than the first 5 songs, but as of yet, this is enough for me to give this a definite 2 thumbs up. It's really hard to find ""non-overdone,"" over-funked, overly-pretty house and trance, but this seems a perfect blend. A definite buy if you loved the pre-mainstream live oakenfold mixes from a few years ago."
5,"Mutual Funds: Your Money, Your Choice...","This book is fabulous! Clear and precise, it answered all my questions. Since I am just getting in the investment game, I was pleasantly surprised to find a book so easy to follow for the novice. Kudos to the author! I am really looking forward to Dr. Jones's next book!"
5,A hidden gem,"OK, I've changed my mind, and this is fully deserving of all five stars. I previously thought it was a bit too predictable, but after listening to it a few more times, this becomes irrelevant. This is a super album of catchy tunes and good songwriting/arrangement. It is a 'big' album i.e. lots of guest musicians, including a string and horn section. The lyrics are more on the observational side, and full of contrast.There is also musical range, from the quirky, roller-coaster style ""House of Love"" and the excellent ""Crying in my Sleep"", to the simple, mid-tempo ""The Truth"", the centerpiece of the album. For all Squeeze fans, this is a must-have"
4,still smooth,"Johnny Mathis is still One of those voices that hasn't been given His Due as one of the most known Voices in Music. this set shows His depth&Range. Johnny Mathis ain't lost a thing. still has One of the Smoothest Voices to Ever Hit the Airwaves.good arrangements,Musicianship&Smooth flow."
4,Mathis ages well,"I've only heard a couple of tracks from this album (that's why I can't give it five stars - yet), but I can tell you this: Johnny's still got it. Time has cost his voice some of its light, floating quality, but though the voice is deeper and heavier, it's still Mathis all the way."
3,Dosen't Fit The 60B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am not much for writing these reviews...After having this base for 4 days waiting for the jointer to come in, I finally picked up the jointer from the freight company!!! I am really ticked off at amazon and one other reviewer for saying this base fits the 60B...I can promise you it is too small....I dont know the base size of the 6 inch Powermatic but I measured the 8 inch base on my jointer and it's right under 24 inches X 18 inches...I rounded it up to the next inch, it's only a quarter inch smaller each way...The base is built nice and I am really disappointed that it doesn't fit!!! Amazon, wake up and stock the powermatic mobile bases on your site!!!!!! I'm sure that this base would probably fit the 6 inch powermatic, but don't order it for the 8 inch or you will be in the same boat I'm in...I now have a 400lb machine and no way to move it untill I get the right mobile base!!! I hope this helps someone out!!!"
3,Ditto the above reviews,"One thing to add is be careful trying to tighten the carriage bolts that hold the front swivel in place. They are cheap, soft metal and I broke two of them trying to tighten them into the round holes they go in. Carriage bolts in round holes is a poor design. Front wheel/brake is kinda Mickey Mouse also, but is does work."
4,Great price and prompt delivery of quality item,Amazon had the best price for this item by far. HTC makes a very good product. You can't go wrong here.
4,Excellent value for the pirce,Before I purchased the HTC base I went to the tool store where I bought the jointer and the price was in the $150.00 bracket which I thought was a little high.I read the reviews on Amazon and there were some concerns about having to shim the sides to adapt the Powermatic to the base. With the price being acceptable I bought assuming I would have some tweeking to do.It turned out that the only issue was that I had to drill a bolt hole on the front and rear mounting tab of the jointer (they both aligned perfectly with the base cross members) and installed a couple of beefy bolts that hold the jointer exactly centered on the base.It was a snap and I hightly recommend the HTC base for my new extended bed Powermatic jointer. Its a great value for the money./
3,Not quite excellent.,"Fabrication of frame and finish is excellent. Easy to assemble. Could have been a tad smaller for custom fit of 54A Jointer stand. What really disappoints me is the pivoting castor. It has one of those swivel locks on the axel of the wheel (can you say CHEAP)which is UNDER the frame. My big feet can't fit under the frame to lock the swivel and its a bit difficult by hand. Would have been EXCELLENT if equipted with the kickdown style castor on the Delta mobile bases. I love the one I have for my band saw. If anyone knows how to retro fit HTC HPJ-6, let me know."
3,It's only ok,"Disappointing buy after reading all the positive reviews. Adjustable grapple has to be just in the right place or the trash will fall on the floor, not in the truck. The augers and the lever that moves them are on opposite sides of the trucks, so it's hard to watch the augers move without leaning on the truck (and eventually breaking it). Feels sturdy but rather overpriced for what it does. Returned it."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased for my 4 year old grandson who is fascinated by garbage trucks. He was so proud of his garbage truck with a ""side claw"". He took special care of this truck. Within approximately 6 weeks of receipt, the claw broke and can not be fixed. He was not mishandling the truck and is very sad that we can not fix it. For the money spent, the product should be more durable."
5,Every little boy should have this truck!,"This has been a favorite of my ""almost"" 4 year old for about a year. It's fun, durable and is played with on a regular basis. When friends come over, everyone goes for this garbage truck.I like that Bruder doesn't use screws or glue. No breaks or problems. Just a great BIG, fun truck."
2,Broke within 5 minutes,"My 5 year old son is a truck fanatic and has a few different Bruder vehicles. He was over the moon to see that Santa had put this truck under the tree this past Christmas. Not 5 minutes had passed when the side loading mechanism snapped off. My husband was able to glue it back together, and it has since held up, but for the price... uh, I mean, for the amount of time the elves put in to make this truck, I was expecting better quality. I will still buy Bruder products, but next time I might go for a truck with less moving parts."
2,Misleading!,Although my son is having fun with this toy I am confused on why the doors don't open...it should really say that when you are reading the details of the product. I assumed because it was a Bruder product and had working parts that the doors would open. Unsure on why they don't? My son doesn't seem to mind but as the customer I am unhappy with this. Well I'm even more disappointed with this product because the side claw broke! So irritated and very upset about the money wasted on this bruder truck.
2,Terrible quality,"My son was ecstatic when he received this from Santa this morning. Within an hour of use parts were falling off. Just now, while he was ""dumping"" garbage the plastic arm snapped. It can't be repaired. He is in tears and I am so disappointed that a toy that cost so much money is already broken. Please don't make the same mistake I did."
2,What a massive disappointment!,"How can I expect my toddler to use this truck when it's difficult for ME to use the arm to pick up the garbage can and dump the contents into the truck? Don't even get me started on the price, which is at least three to four times more than it should be. I assumed by the reviews here, and by the high price tag, that it would be a fantastic present. So disappointed!"
2,"Works, but not cool enough for the price","Got this for my garbage truck-loving 2 year old, and he does like it. However, I don't think it is nearly cool enough or automated enough for the price. 1. No instructions came with it. 2. You have to hold the trash can just right over the hopper, or the trash spills out onto the floor or truck. 3. Kid hasn't figured out how to put the trash can on himself. 4. Not very many things open (as on a real trash truck) - only the back and a sun roof, and the sun roof is a pain in the neck, because it's the only hole in the cab. We bought a WOW toys recycle truck which looks more ""baby-ish,"" but I wish we'd just gotten him another one of those because it is MUCH tougher and has more to do on it."
1,poorly bulit toy,My son has Autism and has very limited interests. The one thing that he wants for Christmas is a garbage truck. This truck has flimsy plastic parts that can easily be broken off. I have either one of two choices: not give him the truck or give him the truck and risk a meltdown when it breaks. I expected so much more from a Bruder toy. I am from Canada and it costs so much to pay for shipping and I wouldn't mind if it was of a better quality than this truck was.
5,great toy,It seems quite durable. Our grandson has played with this truck for hours while spending far less time with his other gifts
2,Hebrew vowels missing - worthless if you know a little Hebrew,"For each English phrase, this book presents the transliteration along with the Hebrew text, BUT the Hebrew text is missing vowels. If you have no intention of learning any Hebrew letters and plan to get by on the transliteration alone, you may find this book acceptable. However, if you already know how to read Hebrew -- or hope to be able to learn -- you'll wind up thwarted. People who are completely literate in Hebrew don't need the vowels -- but they won't be buying a Hebrew phrasebook either. Shame on Lonely Planet for making an otherwise decent book unusable to many of us."
3,Hebrew: Lonely Planet Phrasebook,Took forever to arrive. Got it one or two days before I left for Israel...
5,Perfect!,This case was perfect. The price was right and all the accessories fit perfectly. Plenty of room.
5,Did we read the same book?,"This book was a fascinating read that really opened my eyes to what happened in 1989 during the Tianamen square massacre. I'm not sure the reader from new york and myself read the same book. Salsibury was in his hotel room during some of the events, but I don't blame him. With a totalitarian government's army on the loose against its citizenry, I'm not sure I could call his actions cowardly. This book is a must read for those of you uninformed on the horrific events that occured in this country that we Americans give ""Most favored Nation"" status. Happy hunting to find it, since its out of print."
5,Don Walser's Best,"I admit, I'm biased. I don't think Don Walser can do anything wrong. I met him at a show in San Francisco and he is the sweetest, most unassuming guy in the world. I'm so glad I went to see him, because I hear he's not performing any more - our loss.This is a richly textured, heartfelt CD. From the funny and rockin' Hot Rod Mercury, to the lovely, quirky Rose Marie (with the Kronos Quartet - go figure) every song is a gem. His voice is big and joyful and he's got some great western talent accompanying him. This CD gets better with each listening."
3,Silk Micro G-String,Well - a little brief even by thong standards. Make sure you have a good ....ummmh.... manicurist before you wear out! My husband likes - I wonder where it all goes.
3,Picture is deceitful,"Yes, the picture is super sexy! But the actual product . . well, the design of the panties is the same as the picture. Only that in the picture the actual slit is small (the front of the panties), whereas in the real product the slit is huge - looks like a giant tear drop instead of a slit really. Also, I'm sure that the product is made out of silk as advertised, but it doesn't have that soft silky delicate feel to it - it feels just like cotton. I'm not sure if I would have bought the proudct had I seen a true picture of how it really looks like. The underwear is still sexy, just not as sexy as advertised by the picture."
4,Sexy,"I got this for my girl and she loved it.I got it because I knew it was going to look very sexy on her and I was right it does.The only thing is that it's not that strong,but it's not like it rips from noting,unless you have jewelry or you like to play too rough."
4,whistling good time,"I bought two pair of these, and they're great! they look sexy, they feel sexy, and as an added bonus, when my g/f has to omit some air from her vaginal opening in the form of a queef, the string will often vibrate, producing an attractive high-pitched twanging that really puts the heat in my loins. Sometimes, if I am truly lucky, she also farts, which produces a lower-pitched bass strum in harmony with the queef twang. It is the music of the body, a joy to hear, and I only wish I had a CD filled entirely with twanging fart-queefs. Purchase these and see for yourself!!"
2,One size fits all??? No chance if your girl wears XS / S,"I think I could have actually fit it lol (no I didn't try). If your girl wears XS or sometimes S don't get this. For it to look right we are going to have to cut like an inch off each side and the back and sew it back together. Otherwise, the thing goes half way up her stomach. And she's 5'6"""
1,Do not buy this book!,"This book is the biggest waste of time ever. It is written by a lawyer, whose sole purpose appears to be to get you to use lawyers for everything in life. Forget paraphrasing, I can tell you in depth everything this book taught me in its 209 pages about cleaning up your credit. SUE SUE SUE! In my opinion, Stanley G. Hilton is what's wrong with America today. Nothing is your fault, everything can be blamed on someone else, and you can do that through lawsuits. Unfortunately, there is no zero stars rating, because 1 is about 10 stars too many for this book."
1,THIS AUTHOR WAS DISBARRED,"Stanley Hilton has been suspended from the practice of law by the California State Bar pending full disbarment proceedings. Initiating documents relative to charges that involve moral turpitude are posted on the State Bar website.[...]""Not Eligible To Practice Law"""
4,"Blues, Rock, Pop fusion","David Mullen is better known these days as Nicole C. Mullen's husband. Back in the day, he had his own career. His music could not be different from his wife's.His gritty vocals, in the vein of The Boss, Bryan Adams and John Mellencamp, stand out especially on this album. On After The Hurricane and To Be With You, he shows a softer, melodic side. On Under The Same Sun and Libby he showcases his power and ability to growl on tune.This album is great for someone who, like me, doesn't like to hear song after song that sounds exactly the same. The songs range from soft ballads, to the 70s retro sounding Papa, to the strait up rock-n-roll of Faded Blues all infused with a lot of blues influence.This is one you can listen to again and again without tiring of it."
4,Great Road Music,"Believe it or not, I had never heard of this band until a friend of mine popped this CD into the player on a road trip. I loved it and bought my own copy, and it didn't take many trips before I knew it by heart. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the incredibly schmaltzy, dragging ""Trails of Tears."" Kill that one off and it's one collection you'll be singing along to down many highways for years to come."
3,You HAVE heard of them!!!!!,"Yeah, you have heard this bands songs before.I wouldn't say this is earthshaking stuff, but most of it is quite suprising. I'd say they were a step or two below the Desert Rost Band.They went through a lot of changes, and it shows as you go through the songs and there are several different lead vocalists and styles.You won't really be disapointed with this cd, loyal fans should go for the original albums.But if you are serious about your collections, you do need something from this band in it, and this cd will do nicely."
4,Corporate intrigue and assassination,"A campaign/adventure that throws a team of cyberpunk 2020 characters up against a euro-corp. Business suits meet silenced SMGs in an international struggle for control of a multi-million dollar trade. The campaign is non-linear, with a lot of player freedom of action. There's also a lot of useful information for running takeover bids, and some fun locations."
3,Steppin Out: Anthology,I was surprised that I was not familiar with most of the songs on the CD. The cost of the CD was reasonable & I did receive it quickly.
3,They had the potential to be much bigger.,"It's sad to think that these guys certainly had the potential to become true superstars of 1990s R&B but this album was poorly promoted and got almost no exposure. While the slow-tempo, Quiet Storm-flavored ballads are truly enjoyable, the club-friendly New Jack Swing dance tracks lack distinction and are terribly overproduced. Yes, the voices are there but much of the material LE Gent got was mundane or mediocre."
2,Belfast II,"Belfast II is very nice, however, it's difficult to follow a ""truly anointed-great"" cd...Belfast. I listen to Belfast even to this day. I've owned it for years and have recommended it to everyone. The words are truly inspiring and the melodies are awesome. Belfast is the type of praise and worship cd that drives you to stand to your feet and praise and worship the Lord even if you never have gotten up and moved before...a cd for the ages."
2,Blah,"After a hit comes the sequel, which is usually quite bland. Same with this CD. Revival In Belfast was outstanding, but Revival In Belfast II is quite different. Gone is the Celtic beat. Even Robin Mark seems to have lost his Irish brogue. This CD sounds like a million other Christian CCM CD's. Sorry, but if you want a Celtic Christian music CD, this one is not it."
2,Not so great for watercolor.....,"After getting excited about a new watercolor video by a so called expert, I was really disappointed. He knows his art history, but he paints with watercolor as if it were oil or acrylic. Most of his methods would make a true watercolor artist cringe. It's also a little slow listening to him and he seems a bit full of himself. There are some really great watercolor DVDs out there, this is not one of them."
5,Go Buy it NOW!,"I loved The Distillers s/t album, and I adore Sing Sing Death House. To me, the music has matured and exceeded my expectations. There's not much else to say-except I love this album!P.S. If you are a Rancid fan, do not overlook or discredit The Distillers. Brody rocks harder than any of you ever will."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good album. The music oscillates between old school punk and hardcore, but stays pretty melodic and anthemic throughout most of the album. I tend to really like anthemic punk songs, and they definitely have that going for them.However, none of the songs really grabbed me. My favorite songs on the album are ""The Bullet and the Bullseye,"" ""Sing Sing Death House"" and ""Desperate."" These are fun songs but by no means punk rock masterpieces. All in all, the album is ""good.""Some of the negative things are that is seems a bit too derivative, and a little bit ""put on."" The singer is good overall, but sometimes strikes me like she's trying to sound like Courtney Love sometimes... which is OK, but kinda bugs me a bit. In other words, it doesn't really sound like her singing is really emotionally charged but rather like she's ""trying"" to make it sound that way.As another reviewer said, if you like Rancid you should love this."
4,HOLY (BLEEP)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an awesome cd to say the least.With its punk/metal guitar riffs and raspy vocals,it is sure to be a classic in any punk rock fan's book.This cd reminds me of the 1st HOLE cd.This isnt their 1st album,this is the follow up to their self-titled disc.The 1st one was good but this is great.The lyrics lead vocalist/guitarist Brody Armstrong (a girl for those of you who dont know) spits out range from politics to why they use punk rock`n'roll instead of violence to solve their problems.The only flaw that this cd has is that it is a short 28 minutes long,but thats because the songs are so fast and in my opinion thats how good punk should be,short and fast.So if you like punk rock this is a must have."
5,Distillers...,"We love this CD. There are several favorites on the album, not just one, like many other CD's. My punk rock boyfriend and even I, the part time prep, part time punker loves it too!"
5,BRODY HAS DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE,"I never thought it would happen, but in Sing Sing Death House Brody has recorded a hardcore song that is as hard and real as any recorded by the guys. At times I can hear a bit of Exene Cervenka in Brody's voice... but a lot harder, the way I had always wished it had been. City of angels is the song that I had always wished X would have recorded. The only thing I regret is that she wasn't around in the early eighties to give the girls a voice. No offense to anyone, just my opinion. This is an amazing album!"
4,A great modern punk album!,"I'm not usually the biggest fan of modern punk -- most of the punk cds in my collection are from the late 70's and early 80's -- but I absolutely love this album. The Distillers are loud and angry, but are very capable of writing catchy songs. Brody's a fantastic frontwoman for this band, with her gritty voice and really solid lyricism. I saw the Distillers play a few years ago at Lollapalooza, and they play hard, too! Every song is good on the CD, but my favorites are ""That Crazed Young Peeling"" and ""City of Angels""."
1,Haven't heard the CD but.......,saw them live and they were the worst band I have ever seen or heard. That's saying something after listening to and seeing punk bands for the last 12 years. I usually am pretty patient with unknown bands and at least give them a try but this band was so awful I actually clapped when they announced their last song. I want those lousy 30 minutes of my life back.
2,British Number 1's Hits,From England and they might be all hits there but not here in the USA.From 1960 to 1989 with just 18 songs to cover the period....can't be done and they didn't. No songs from 1960 or 1989 either. They had some songs and they simply used them.Save your money.
5,Priceless -- Precisely!,"I think Heinzerling and Ackerman show within their very first chapter that they are totally ""on"" to the tricks of the ""C/B/A"" Dick Graham policynakers of our day, that they have a powerful critique of and rebuttal to that technique, and a talent for putting forth some very good, easily-understood examples that enable anyone with interest in the subject and a decent amount of common sense to figure out the great (hmm) game being played ""out there.""I hate economics jargon, but i really liked this book."
3,Not as good as Give em the boot 2....,"I was excited when I saw that their was a new Give em the boot compilation out, as Give em the boot 2, is one of my favorite cd's ever. Although when I played this cd I was sad to hear that the reggae and ska sounds that where on Give em the boot 2 have been substituted for a straight ahead punk compilation. Not to mention that the quality of songs on this album, are nowhere as good as the tracks selected for the two previous Give em the boot cd's. If you are going to get a Give em the Boot cd, buy the second installment, it is much better..."
2,Save your [money],"Okay, Give Em The Boot I & II were rad, but this pulls up far short of those comps. The best bands - Rancid, DKM, LFB, US BOMBS - all have songs on here that have been previously released, so there's nothing value-added from them. Yeah, Cupid's Victim is a really good song and the videos aren't bad, but they're readily available on the net, so, again, nothing new. I'm down with different types of music but the ska on here is weak and the pyscobilly stuff is unlistenable. Devils Brigade is a disappointment. The only bright spots are the good effort by Duane Peters & the Hunns and the rad track ""Give Em The Boot""Originally I'd heard this disc was going to include a previously unreleased song by LFB and a new video by Rancid, which would have made it much better. Even if the bands on this record had rerecorded different versions of released material, there would be something new for fans. There wasn't even a sticker included like with the last comp.Save your [money]."
2,In a word: Disappointing.,"Give 'Em The Boots I and II are punk-rock neccessities. Sprinkled with ska, reggae and rocksteady, they were truly palatable for those of us with eclectic tastes. Sadly, Give 'Em The Boot III purifies itself of most of the reggae and ska from it's two previous outings, leaving us with a punk rock wasteland. The songs here just simply aren't up to Hellcat's high standars. There are a few good moments (The Slackers' BRILLIANT ""Information Error"", the Tiger Army video) but that is outweighed by a parade of messy and talentless punk rock. Even the Rancid track is anemic.Although, for [the money], ""Give 'Em The Boot III"" isn't much of a gamble. Still, it's been three years since Vol. II, and III frankly falls flat on it's body-pierced face."
4,goner is a winner,"it rocks. i found that i could identify with every song, every lyric; like someone singing out words i couldn't come up with for the thoughts in my head."
4,Begin here....,"If you are a Goner fan, this was their first release and where you ought to start. If you've gone in the wrong order are you doomed? No sir! All Goner is good Goner and this album doesn't disappoint. The band is tight, the songs have stories and if you enjoy that kind of schtick, you will enjoy this music.Start you Goner adventure here! The gentlemen of Goner will thank you by raising a pint."
4,"Yes, This album really is good.","All those Eric Benet fans wondering if this album is worth the $15 or so bucks, yes it is. Eric's last album ""A Day In The Life"" you may know was a rich mixture of R&B;, Smooth Jazz and Pop. This album is a little more adult contemporary. Without a doubt Eric uses this album to do some soul searching and uses his music as therapy to deal with the events of the past 6 years.The one thing you can count on is that all the songs here are written beautifully. Beautiful poetic lyrics and melodies, some with full orchestra arrangements. This album is definately bluer than his last album, but you would expect that after hearing about his love life in the news in recent years. I believe Eric is using this album ""Hurricane"" to purge himself of his pain and regrets among other things, and move forward. Hopefully the next album will be more upbeat, but more importantly be JUST AS consistant as this one is."
4,"Bravery, Honesty and the Gift to Communicate Both","The words are so open, and simple, and honest. Eric didn't clutter the lyrics of his life with whining (ex: ""too complicated for this simple man""). He just got it out on the table for us, the listeners, to absorb in whatever way we choose. The style is different from his previous CD's...more mature. But then, Eric is different, isn't he?"
3,Eric Benet's Still Got It,"Amazingly, I'm not gonna hate on the brotha because of the Halle thing; that's a whole 'notha' matter. But this CD is quite beautiful. His pipes are still strong, and the music is decent. My favorite is Pretty Baby because I tend to love upbeat music more than ballads. A pretty good compilation, and one I DO NOT consider a waste of money."
5,Hurricane's a comin'!,"wow.....all I can say is wow.....I think I speak for all the Eric Benet fanatics here that this cd was a loooong time coming....From my perspective, when great singers that go through controversy/drama in their life usually put out awesome cds. and this cd is no exception.Personal favorites include:Pretty Baby- soft sexuality about this song, in the same vein as ""Femininity""Hurricane- FEEL HIS PAIN.....this to me is his cleansing song, about picking up the pieces and moving on with his life.My Prayer and Man Enough To Cry- two of the most heartfelt songs on the cd. Damn near started the waterworks for me!!!His most reflective, most down to earth cd yet and cannot wait to see him in concert.Lastly, if you love this cd as much as I do.....try George Michael's Older which was released in '96. He was going through alot of pain during that time and that is his best work. Forget the Wham days, this cd will change your whole outlook on him."
2,yawn,"I guess Eric has lots of friends making these reviews because the cd is not at all that good. It is depressing and melancholy. Too many songs about lost love, being sorry, etc. It's a great remedy if you're having trouble sleeping, but don't listen to it if you're depressed, as it will send you over the edge :-)I am a true Eric Benet fan, but this cd just didn't do it for me. Maybe the next one will meet my expectations."
2,Hurricane Eric crashed,"Eric Benet is a Talented Cat,but even in his Peak he was at best a 2nd tier type of Cat. He never had His own Musical Idenity.this album should have dropped a year ago,2 years ago,3 years ago,4 years ago,5 Years ago. Eric Benet ain't the kind of Artist that can take no 6 years between Album breaks.His vocals are cool,but the Musical Arrangements don't do much for me.at One time it seemed like Eric might have a Decent Run at a Music Career,but now He is just trying to hang in there&going by this Album the Local Lounge or Holiday Inn ain't that far away."
1,"OK, OK, you messed up !!","Halle ain't coming back, so stop the whining. I bought this as a sympathy purchase and was quite disappointed. Did expect the sad, pittying and apologizing, but where is that funky soul? Come back when you've gotten past all the drama and give us the Eric of Old."
4,A Soulful Balladeer!,"Not only is this man sexy, but his voice is beautiful! Some albums are for juking, this one is for reflection and relaxing. His version of ""Pretty baby"" is smokin'. If you are deeply in love, just made up, or going through a break-up, this album definitely evokes emotions. I am curious about the last song ""Still with you"", I have to listen to it again, but I don't know if he's talking about a physical or emotional death of the relationship. In any case, it's a nice song. Anyone who's been in love will appreciate ""The last time"" which is a great wedding song. I would say there's a good five songs I keep on repeat. Let's support good artists like Eric...If anyone knows Mr. Benet, ask him if he's really ready to be loved. That should have been the title for this album. That song is GREAT.Good artist, good music, good buy."
5,Feel Good Music,"I'm a new Eric Benet fan. I heard some of this music during his 20/20 interview last fall which peaked my interest in him as a artist.Eric, you put heart, soul & spirit in this project and indeed you have come thru the journey with a HIT.Every track is masterfully done. Eric Benet has outdone himself on this project.You will not be disappointed, this CD is a WINNER!!"
3,Too sad for me,"I'm a huge fan but just like Eva, listening to this CD makes me feel so sad and I don't enjoy that. I guess what he was feeling came across on the CD. I love to hear this man sing but the sadness makes this CD hard to listen to."
5,awesome!,"I recieved this album from a friend and had never really listened to him before....I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it! Being a song writer myself, I can truly feel the essence of himself in this CD...I wore it out...I think that I am going to have to buy another one! I was very impressed and disappointed that more people don't have this CD. Everyone makes mistakes and no one is perfect so they need to look past what happened and enjoy his music...I am so happy to listen to an artist who is not a carbon copy of everyone else out there...he is truly a songwriter and an artist that will stay on my list....I can't wait until the next CD!!"
3,I Like It!,"Eric Benet is so grossly underrated - it's really sad he doesn't get the airplay he deserves. I bought this disc solely because of the song ""Pretty Baby."" That is the hottest song on the disc!! The rest of the disc isn't bad at all. ""I Wanna Be Loved"" and ""Making Love"" are nice as well."
4,EB...Excited Buyer!,"This CD is very underated! If you are a ""true"" Eric Benet fan, this is one to buy and keep. I look forward to #4!"
3,Dam Good Singer,"Eric Benet,This brother can sing and the music is good.I appreciate artist out there that have the courage to createsomething new every time out.When it's like that, there are bound to be one or two on the albumthat makes you want to skip over them.That's how this album is. Some of the songs make me say, let medo something else while that's playing.I have to wait awhile before I can play this album again.The mood kinda goes down hill after awhile.As far as Halle Berry, she fine that's no doubt.Maybe it was her fault, nobody knows.She could've not been taking care of home.All the traveling and she's real friendly.Maybe that was hard for a brother to handle allthe time.Not saying he was the jealous type at all.But everybody has a little bit hidden somewhere.I think that would bring it out.It's like, baby let this dude get his ownwomen to talk too, you know.J-Lo, had to stop that once she got married.Her husband came on TV and said,""a... it's like that... ""."
3,I love some Eric Benet...,"What a great voice, you can deny him that. Silky, sharp and strong. Just like I like my men... With this CD he was definitely in a dark place and still in love with H. Berry but I'll forgive him for that one. Overall a solid CD and worth the money. This is a good CD to listen to if you're running on the treadmill or jogging outdoors. All the songs are bearable and have a nice melody. I will NEVER stop supporting E. Benet."
5,Very relaxing,If you are looking for something to relax you and enjoy all at the same time this CD is the one. I'm very pleased with my decision to purchase the CD. It comes highly recommended.
3,booooring,"I know this CD has received a lot of positive reviews and I really don't know why. In my opinion it was rather boring. There were only six songs I liked that helped bring life to this CD:Pretty Baby-7/10Where Does the Love Go-7/10My Prayer-10/10 (the best song on the album, very lovely melody and beautiful lyrics)I Know-9/10Making Love-8/10I Wanna Be Loved-9/10I really never listened to Eric Benet's music. But when I heard ""I Wanna Be Loved"" on the radio I decided to give him a try. I was rather disappointed because half of this CD is truly boring. I had to keep skipping over some tracks to listen to songs that were more upbeat. The majority of the songs were just too slow. The reason why I gave it three stars because the above mentioned songs really stood out and are some of the best songs I heard. ""My Prayer"" is so beautiful, I listen to it over and over again.Overall this is an average CD. Thank God for the six songs that brought this boring CD to life."
3,"MORE LIKE A ""TROPICAL STORM""","No Halle, no problem, right? You would think he'd drop his best emotional material to date but it just didn't quite get there. I liked the kinda stripped down accoustic feel to it for the most part but the verve wasn't there. Some tracks he made me go ""Yeah, I feels ya, brotha"" and other cuts I went ""Blah. Well, whatever"". ""I Wanna Be Loved"" is a nice cut and ""Be Myself Again"" has that George Michael ""Faith"" feel to it. ""Making Love"" is a cool vibe. ""The Last Time"" is a great ballroom-style cut and ""Still With You"" is a cool ballad as well. A nice, solid effort by Eric."
2,Its Got Some Ok Stuff,"This album is not bad, but its definitely not as good as an album with a 6 year waiting period should be. Actually, its not that much different than the last album...6 years ago. Musically, his sound hasn't changed or grown much, but there are some moments in some of the songs that really catch you and make you smile. All in all, there is just enough good stuff on this album to make you not regret buying it, but I recommend not worrying too much if you haven't bought it yet.-Peace-"
2,Average at best,I wanted to like this cd but I couldn't find a reason to even give it a second listen.
2,GOOD BUT IT TOOK LONG TO FALL IN LOVE,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK HOWEVER IT TOOK A LONG TIME, FOR THE PASSION TO COME I MEAN THE MAN WAS BLIND BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS IN ORDER. THE BOOKED JUST DRAGED OUT PLUS IT HAS LOTS GOING ON WITH HIS MOTHER. LILLY WAS A FIGHTER SHE JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT I DID LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE GOT THE RING AND THE EDUCATION.!I WISH THE END OF THE BOOK HAD BEEN THE MIDDLE I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SEE WHAT HAPPEN WITH THEM LATER ON. I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST AUTHORS DON'T WANT TO ADD TO MUCH SEX IN THE BOOKS BUT WHEN IT'S BETWEEN TO PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER IT'S WORTH READING ABOUT."
5,Love it!!,I have been looking for a tow hitch plug for my SUV for sometime and have only seen those cheep plastic ones. Could not find one that I liked and stumbled on this one while surf shopping. It is so nice all aluminum. I did buy a hitch lock so it did not turn up missing.
1,"too large for 1.25"" receiver","The Tigger hitch cover looks great, it's made of metal, and looks like it would last through a lot of punishment. It does not fit into a 1.25"" receiver though."
5,This rocks!,"This is just a great album!Great vocals, guitars and melodies. Rockers and Ballads the way we like it!This just delivers and will blow anyone away who is into Whitesnake, Blue Murder, TNT, Dokken, quality hard rock from the 80ies.Try their other albums, especially 'Trust' and IV"
3,You need fingernails,"I bought this for my six year old son Christmas 2010 hoping it was like my daughter's Read-And-Play Horse Farm book with plastic stickers that are very easy to peel off, but no. These do peel off and are reusable, but my son always needs me to do it for him. You have to get your nail under a corner, with some effort, and peel gently and in the right direction or you will rip the sticker. He likes to play with it though if I am able to help him. This is the only construction equipment subject book that has ""reusable"" stickers that I could find so that the two children can be side by side playing with their books."
3,"Fun Cd, BUT......","It is hard for me not to give this cd 5 stars, since I am a BIG fan of all Buffett music. I have found, however, after repeated listening, that the sound quality (especially the frequent drop-outs of Jimmy's voice) is quite distracting and keeps me from really enjoying the CD. NOW, the sound quality IS A pretty true representation of a live Buffett concert..but it still is distracting. If you like Buffett's live stuff I would be quicker to recommend the new MiniMatinee DVD or the TUESDAYS, THURSDAYS, SATURDAYS CD. I planned on buying the Auburn Cd, but will pass after hearing Vegas."
4,Be your own judge....,"When I went to this concert, I thought it was one of his best (and I've been to plenty!). Then when I found out it was recorded and would be out on CD, I was excited to say the least and couldn't wait. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed but bought the CD anyway. I am a little miffed about the delay between songs, but I can get over that. This CD is great and brings back all the awesome memories of that concert. If you are reading this and went to that concert - it is a must buy. And even if you didn't go to the concert and are a true fan, add this one to you collection. Hope this helps... Phan in Phoenix"
1,An amateur could have edited this CD!,"The song selection and sound quality on this CD are fine. The unbelievable thing is that there's a 2 second gap between songs. This really disrupts the flow of this CD. I can't believe they would release this CD this way! It's just like those cheap bootlegs that people create from MP3's, and then burn them to CD using ""track at once"" instead of ""disc at once"".Stay away from this show. Buy the Auburn show instead. They got it right on that one.The only thing I can think happened with the Vegas show is that there was a goof up in the manufaturing process and they dubbed these discs using track at once instead of disc at once (which would have left no gaps between songs).I'm returning the Vegas show for a refund."
1,Wrong Disc,"Man was I suprised when I put in Disc 1 and dicovered it was not Jimmy Buffett, but Nancy Sinatra's Greatest hits. I can only review Disc 2. Hopefully I can return it for a refund."
1,WHY THE GAPS?,"Let me start by saying that I would have given this cd four stars for the sound and performance. However, what I find unforgivable in this day and age of technology is to leave 2 second edit cuts on every index marker. It gives what should have been a fantastic show the feeling of an amateur bootleg. Next time give the job to someone who knows what they are doing! If you can't find anyone, I'll do the job properly!"
1,3 sheets to the wind,"By the last third of this concert Jimmy is loaded with 3 sheets to the wind.The songs are in slow motion by then.His greatest live album is tuesdays,thursdays,saturday"
4,good show,"great show.. great quality.. great grateful dead ""franklins tower"""" on one particular harbor.. great heady show"
2,Hamburger,"It's the difference between prime aged steak and hamburger. This CD is just hamburger, not even a cheeseburger. I'm disappointed that Jimmy would allow distribution of a recording of this poor quality. His name is on it, I expected more. Jimmy, what do you want to be known for?"
5,The Wolf's Hour,"This was the first book I had read written by Robert R. McCammon and it was fantastic throughout the whole book.Here's the back coverHe is Michael Gallatin,master spy,lover-and werewolf.Able to change shape with the lighting speed,to kill silently or with savage,snarling fury,he proved his talents against Rommel in Africa.Now he faces his most delicate,dangerous mission to unravel the secret Nazi plan known as Iron Fist.From a parachute jump into occupied France to the lush corruption of Berlin,from the arms of a beautiful spy to the cold embrace of a madman's death machine,Gallatin draws ever closer to the ghastly truth about Iron Fist.But with only hours from D-Day,he is trapped in the Nazis's web of destruction."
5,TRULY UNIQUE!!,"How many times can you say you've read a truly unique book. Because there are so many writers, especially in the horror genre, ideas seem to run out pretty quick, only to be repeated a few years later by another author. Well, at first sight, it might appear that Robert McCammon has just written about the same old idea of the Werewolf, that was created in the beginning of the last century. Thinking this, I was not prepared for such a unique story. I am awe struck even now. I dont believe that I have EVER read a book with such detailed action, and suspense. This is the perfect book for those boring, rainy, depressing days, when you need a little exitement in your life. My applause, once again, to Robert McCammon, for such a wonderful book."
4,Making this subject matter work is pure genius.,"If anyone had told me that a good book could be written about a Nazi werewolf, I would have told them that they were crazy. Then I read ""The Wolf's Hour"". Exceptional!"
4,Great were book,McCammon has written one of the better werewolf books I have read. While the story line bounces back and forth between two time settings its an enjoyable read. If you like werewolfs this one should be on your list.
4,If only James Bond could grow hair and fangs ...,"One man stands between a terrible Nazi plot to use poison bombs. That man is a secret spy with a very unique background. Raised in the Russian wilds, he was bit as a boy by strange creatures and now whenver there's trouble he can let the animal whithin loose, literaly.This is an exteremly good book, exciting and thrilling. Combining Nazi agents and plots, spying and a werewolf creates a story that is quite unique. Seeing the way the hero uses the wolf to pursue his goals was also very intersting.The only thing that bothered me some when reading the book was the nature of the Werewolf curse itself. In the book, it was created by a virus and was not supernatural, hence no immunity to bullets and no attraction to the moon. It is a legitimate choise for the author but it did bother me some ... If you're going to bring in a werewolf, why not one who has all of its powers?"
5,Werewolves and War! Can it get any better?,"It was a pefect book for me since it merged the two genres that I love. The departure from the traditional Lon Chaney style of lycanthropy was also very refereshing. I read this book about 8 years ago but I still reread it once in while (at least until my copy holds up, then I'm buying another). Even though there are some holes in the historical background of the main story it was pleasure to read, even for a strickler for military history as myself."
3,"An ""A List"" character trapped in a ""B Movie"" book","Michael Gallatin, the lycanthrope of the title, is a wonderfully tragic hero, and I was transfixed by the backstory of his transformation from nobleman's son to werewolf in revolutionary Russia. His strength and determination to survive slowly win him a place among a werewolf pack in the hidden castle of the forest. His pack-mates are vividly original characters whom we learn to care about as much as Michael does.The story, however, disintegrates into ridiculous cliche once the World War II adventure begins. The Nazi villains are evil stereotypes straight out of a B movie melodrama, and die in nauseating ways. The heroines are lovely, courageous and fall into Michael's arms for passionate love-making. Even the British, American and Russian allies are stereotypes of their nationalities. I was severely disappointed to wade through a action-packed, yet ultimately frustrating plot that lacked any original ideas or characters."
5,Excellent Reading!,I could not put this book down. After reading Swan Song I immediately began to read Wolf's Hour. Robert McCammon is truly a gifted and imaginative writer. His stories are so detailed that you feel as though you can picture everything. I am going to purchase any other of his books that are available.
3,A werewolf 'James Bond',"As other reviewers have mentioned, this almost seems like two books. I enjoyed the parts about Michael's earlier history (his time with the pack) but found the WWII portion completely ridiculous. In fact, the 'train ride' section left me just shaking my head at how over-the-top it was."
5,A Howling Good Time...,"Wolfs Hour tells two fantastic intertwined tales. Mikail Gallintov watched his parents get murdered as a small boy. And, like many myths, he was raised by wolves. These however, are no ordinary wolves - they are lycanthropes and Mikail learns the way of the werewolf. The skills he learns in his youth aid him in his impossible mission to stop the Nazi's from unleashing a deadly attack that will prevent the D-Day invasion.There are ""bad guys"" at every turn, some in the form of SS officers, some are deranged chemical weapons scientists, and one is a hunter that is hunting for a very rare prey.Buy this book if you love adventure and impossible odds - read it late at night when the moon is full.It will leave you howling.Relic113"
5,Great read!!,"I remember reading this book for the first time in 1993 or so, when I was deemed old enough for it. I loved the whole werewolf spy in WWII setting. Some might have found it a stretch, but then, they should probably have picked up another book. The story was exciting from the first page until the last with plenty of action while giving us glimpses of what made the protagonist into what he is. I always thought that there should have been a follow up to this book as there were a few unanswered questions at the end of Wolf's Hour. I read this book at least twice a year for about five years, and only stopped doing that when my copy was lost with some personal effects while on deployment. Really glad it's available on Kindle now!"
4,Exciting read,"Loved the story, of course it's unbelievable but the author draws you in and that next page must be turned!"
4,Great story,"I originally owned the paper back of this book but couldn't put my hands on it. I ordered this hard copy of it, knowing it was a used book, but I didn't realize how ""used"" it was. If I had known the condition of it better I would have just ordered another paperback copy. The story itself reads as well as when I read it years ago in high school. It was the first book that got me turned onto Robert R. McCammon. Definitely worth a read and a purchase. Just don't get that ""used"" hard back. I plan on unloading this puppy first chance I get."
2,Werewolfs Galore,"I am always looking for a good book on WWII. This unfortunately wasn't one of my favorites. As many readers have alluded to, this is a great book if you want to understand the mind and the changes a lyncathrope goes through. His description of the change in the early parts of the book are fascinating and realistic. The plot is okay for the WWII buffs in the begining. North Africa and the spy intrigue are good. But from the time he parachutes into France there were just too many flashbacks for me and in the end, it appeared he almost forgot that ""Operation Iron Fist"" must be stopped. Sorry, just not my favorite read."
2,Wolf's Hour is McCammon's weakest hour.,"The Wolf's Hour reads like two different novels grafted together. One is the tale of the origins of a unique werewolf, the other is that now adult werewolf working as a spy for England in WW2. Neither plays well with the other. The book also suffers from an 11th hour back to his roots subplot that just makes the story drag on even longer, mainly due to its needlessly repeating events already explored in the character's childhood. This is one 'epic' that is far too padded to do its stories justice."
2,Lame,"This book is pretty weak. It reads like a list of cliches taken from James Bond and every other cheapo action book you could imagine. The women are all beautiful and mainly interested in sex with the hero; the Nazis (of course) wear big boots and are psychotic; the head of the secret government agency has to come to beg the hero to come out of retirement for one more job; there are shoot-outs and fist fights galore..... I think you get the point. The language is at its worst during the romantic scenes, which are barely one step above Romance novel cliches. I will give the book the following. There is a ton of action from stop to start. But generally, this is a weak thriller."
5,Utterly enjoyable...a must read,"Enjoyed the book thoroughly, this was my first experience with Robert McCammon, will be heading for Stinger and then swan song,,, hoping I'll enjoy them as much......"
5,The Wolf's Hour - McCammon does it again.,Robert McCammon does it again with The Wolf's Hour. Proving himself to be one of North America's leading writers again and again. The Wolf's Hour defies genres - its in a class all of its own. Michael Gallatin aka Mikhail Gallantinov a gutsy Russian werewolf who has taken up residence in London England. He is a british spy who just happens to have an edge over the enemy. a great werewolf story and a great war story. This one will satisfy every need. Don't miss it.

2,Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese,"I like organic. We do organic milk and meat, and vegetables when we can afford the latter. My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole, of course (lol), but out of a box. (Reasons for this preference are unknown.)In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.Perhaps it is because of the lack of chemicals that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.Two Stars. Maybe I just had a bad box. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case."
1,Product mislabeled as organic,"Nutrition facts posted by Amazon list product as organic but it is not USDA organic certified and nowhere on the box is the word ""organic"" listed."
1,Organic Buyers Beware,"Don't buy this if you think you're buying organic macaroni and cheese. I guess I'm more than shocked about how this is fraudulently advertised on Amazon.com. In its product features, it says: ""Made with organic cheddar cheese."" This is blatantly false. When you receive the Mac and Cheese, it's packaged in a neat little ""Back to Nature"" box announcing its support of the Nature Conservancy on the back of the box giving it the veneer of being ""natural."" However, if you read the ingredients, not even the cheddar cheese is organic. There is no organic certifier to be found, either.Now, this actually breaks the National Organic Program standards and should be investigated by the Agriculture Department. This changes my whole view of Kraft -- not that it was especially good before. But apparently, this company buys into the ""greenwashing"" effort to try to cash in on the good organic name without actually supporting the type of food system we expect when we buy organic."
4,Wonderful 50s Music,This cd contains the major hits of Hugo and several other songs made popular by other artists. There are some fun tunes and some beautifulpieces. A slice of 1950s instrumental pop.
2,Pretty awful.,"There's a reason great actors get paid the big bucks: their voices have a quality that makes anything they read interesting and thought-provoking. Not so with these amateurs. They all sound like my past English teachers who made me hate poetry. Having no inate vocal qualities, they over emphasize every word and emotion, like someone reading a poem to young children. There is no subtlety or sub-text. If you just want to hear some famous poetry, maybe you'll like this. But if you're looking for something that will actually move you as you listen, this ain't it."
4,Australian culture shock,I'm not done reading this purchase but the table of contents indicates that it will provide interesting coverage of the Australian culture. The parts I have read are informative.
2,Amusing but not much else,"I read this only to find myself laughing at the content. The author seems to have completely missed out on the variety of people living in Australia. The kind of 'Customs and Etiquette' mentioned would leave most Australians quite unsure of how to deal with the one using them.Also, the author failed to mention the contributions of the ANZAC soldiers during both World Wars as well as peacekeeping missions throughout the world, instead belittling their involvement.Overall far too generalised."
1,Hopelessley outdated and exaggerated.,"The author begs forgiveness in the beginning of the book for any slight she may cause to Australians as her information is drawn from Perth. I find it telling that the publishers would pay an author money to write a book about Australia when she has only experienced one small part of it.Much of the ""information"" in this book was outdated by at least forty to fifty years. I'm so tired of reading that we speak in rhyming slang, as an Aussie the only time I've ever heard or seen it is from books like these or one or two very old movies.Much of the book is wildly exaggerated, and contains factual errors ie Paul Keating was not a Premier, he was our Prime Minister. I found the book extremely patronising in places, ""Australians are a child- like people...""If you wish to mock Australians get this book, If you want an accurate guide to Australia try ""How Australia Compares"" by Rodney Tiffen & Ross Gittins."
4,Don't call them funk....,"Mr Bungle's first release on Warner Bros. could arguably be their most accessible album to the average listener. Not to say that I think that this is their best. No, that would have to be ""Disco Volante"", but this album is still loads of fun. The album's music goes from ska, to swing, to funk, to metal, circus music, and even porno music! A definite must-have for any fans of Mike Patton and FNM, who is looking for an introduction to the world of Mr. Bungle."
4,Mr. Bungle,"This Is the first official album of Mr. bungle, the highly inventive and on this album, slightly misguided, musical geniuses. This album is good, but doesn't bring the same punch that, disco volante, and california brings, it does however, go into the music more than both disco volante, and california do.1.

3,Meh...,"It's really not that great. When you listen to all the hype that surrounds this from all over, it seems like an avant-garde classic or some piece of absolute genius, but in reality it's just ok. It's not terrible, especially if you like crazy circus music or whatever, but it's just nothing special. And I'm not saying it's bad because it's wierd or out there because I listen to much wierder and crazier music than this (Buckethead, Eric Dolphy, Ornette Coleman, etc.) and part of the reason I got this was because it was produced by John Zorn, whose album, Naked City, I highly recomend instead of this, because this is similar to it in a trying-to-be-but-not-quite-as-good sort of way. Give it a listen and get it if you like it, but don't get due to the hype, it's overated."
1,Pales in comparison...,While I believe this is a fantastic album (for its time)......it certainly pales in comparison to Disco Volante and California which are the bands 'masterpieces'...So I'm giving it one star as to not mislead people to think that this is the better album for its higher rating...
1,critical note,"I don't really like the CD, because I don't like funk-metal and I think the music contains far too much of it, which I think is not good. What should be so avantgardistic about funk-metal? It's all too chart-friendly. Especially this one Song, dead goon sounds like a very cheap Bon-Jovi-remake. And the vocals are really detestable, this guy sings like madonna on prozac or at least pretends to. And I wonder if it was for these reasons that he didn't want to put his real name on the sleeve. But anyway, one little star for the lyrics, they're good, at least, and sometimes they remind me of my English textbooks at school. Except for girls of porn, I think it's not funny to make fun of people who need buying adult magazines to satisfy their sexual needs."
1,Lame Zappa!,"See above...the music ideas were weak. There's nothing really original here to my ears...Just a weak and derivative mix in which the ingredients never really gave themselves the opportunity to break new ground and foster organic ideas to take the world that Lawrence Welk created to new heights. Instead it's ""this goes here, that goes there""...too much of the same material (and each piece was 4-7 minutes in length) it was hard to keep up the patience to appreciate it as a whole....the recording was so boomy (like all recordings today) I couldn't understand what the guy was saying, printed lyrics or not...sounded like a hip-hop record. This is the second time I tried to get into these guys but once again, dissapointed...even Zappa himself bored me a lot...give me Dead Kennedys or the Bonzo Dog Band any day, now THEY were original...this is just a failed attempt at evil circus/clown music (an old stereotype in itself)"
5,CRAZY GENIUS,This Album is crazy.You must listen to it.Lyrical and musical Genius.Lyrical and musical Crazyness.YOU MUST LISTEN TO IT!!!
5,Very Nice,"This is my favorite Mr.Bungle CD. When I first got it, I had never heard Mr.Bungle before so it took a few listenings before the music really grew on me. By the third time through, I really appreciated how good this album is. I especially like tracks 1-5 & track 8. The rest of them aren't bad but I don't feel that they are particularly powerfully moving songs. If you really like Primus, then I would imagine that you will really like this CD. It's pretty good. For this CD, you really have to take the good with the bad. The highpoints are appreciated when you add them together with the not-especially-fantastic songs. You hafta hear the CD as a whole before it can be enjoyed to its Fullest. Buy this CD and I think you might very well like it."
2,"Incredible musicianship, terrible songwriting","I gave this album a chance because it was recommended to me by a couple hipsters. I appreciate artists like Primus and Frank Zappa for their musical talent and avant garde style. Mr. Bungle seems to fit these two catagories, so I thought I'd dig them.The musicianship is incredible, arrangements are highly complicated, the lyrics are really out there. However, it's hard to appreciate it all when the songs simply aren't enjoyable to me. Many people listen to music for different reasons. Perhaps for shock value or brain exercise. For me, I simply listen to enjoy.The technical prowess of all the instruments are highly advanced (especially for when this was released). But in the end, this collective musical effort is not pleasing and lacks soul."
3,"Mr. Bungle likes you, but only if you rape it","This is for people who like music that could be called bizarre depending on who you are. Don't get me wrong by the rating, I really like a lot of Mike Patton's music and think this album is extremely enjoyable but only when the right mood strikes. If this was an album to be highly enjoyed equally at any time it would for sure get 5 stars from me. But I only love the shit out of it if I am feeling funky which happens to be quite often but whatever. This is one of the most eclectic and diverse albums possibly ever and is only for strange little minds like myself and quite a few others. There is an extremely high chance that any random person will hate it so only listen if you are totally willing to try something different. Anyway, it's odd and it's wild and it's fun and it's grand. Bye now."
4,Clowning Around with Mr Bungle,"This is one of the few albums where I almost agree with the ""Parental Warning"" i.e. ""Tipper Sticker"" on the front cover. This is music that you in no way want your child to listen to.Mr. Bungle is nasty, crazy, off the wall and frantic. It would be almost pointless if it weren't for the fact that Mike Patton is a nearly genius level artist. His palette is the strange, insane landscape of the human psychological ID. This album is the sonic landscape of what the world would be like if there were no counterbalancing ego or superego. It is a full steam ahead loco train into the depths of craziness.Such as it is, I find it interesting in that it serves as a great vehicle for exercising the human ID via a musical recording. Beyond that, the musical time changes and artistry are, like I said, mind blowing and almost genius level in their terrible antics. Once again, I advise caution with this one, as it is for mature audiences. Well, sort of mature. Thanks!"
4,Travolta,"I've yet to meet anyone who is ambivalent regarding Mr. Bungle. I've known many who hated them, and many who felt quite the oppposite. However, everyone has some reaction.Zorn has done many beautiful horrible things to what humankind calls music. This is one of them."
1,Another Plain Record : Piece of crap,"Lp defective pressing. Another. Plain Records, avoid this label. Is a lack of respect selling these products. Never buy any LP of PLAIN."
2,"this album is a ""great southern trend kill""","well this album isnt all that bad its no msi though they think that they are insane because they have circus music in there songs but bands like tubring and dog fashion disco do that too and theyre better at it if u ask me. frankly just go buy the left rights or or not mr. bungle. it just reminds me of how horrible 90's music was (pantera).AND ANOTHER THING PPL AT MY SCHOOL LOVE MR. BUNGLE AND MIKE PATTON ARGHHHHH. AND IVE ASKED THEM ""ever heard of MSI and they say no"" and that makes this album bad somehow. if u want weird acute music instead of this mainstream industrial bland vocals music go buy franken girls or tight. and mike patton's vocals. hes just ripping off anthony keidis (RHCP 4 EVER!!!!!!) AND KORN. theyre just a horrible band, and i only like the bands that came from them because they had no clue what they were doing. but dog fashion disco and tubring snd screaming boner just own mr. bungle BTW AFI sux"
1,You've got to be kidding me.,"Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call ""creatively aggresive"" music. Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.) Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.Anyway, Mr. Bungle.... tepid. Uninteresting. Bland. Stupid. Gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over. Let them. Someone's got the fuel the economy."
2,Don't buy the VINYL format. **I'M SERIOUS**,"Very poorly remastering.I can't believe such a great album got so screwed in vinyl format.You have to turn the volume to the maximum from the start, otherwise you will hear whispers and grass like that. Very low volume.You will hear kinda scratchy sounds in the quiet parts.No compre la versión en vinilo, no vale la pena. Suena muy bajo, hay que subir el volumen al máximo para escuchar bien. Puta vida con esta remasterización."
5,Awesome,"Buy this Mr.bungle Cd! Its my favorite bungle CD and his best in my opinion. Mr.Bungle Rocks, Also try faith no more."
5,Too wierd NOT to like,"Yeah, the title pretty much sums it up. Mr Bungle are one of those genuinely unique bands that is capable of doing something totally different (and pretty bizarre) without turning it into an incomprehensible mash of noise. Transitions between musical styles are frequent, interesting, and well executed. Amazingly, this band seems to be able to play jazz, swing, rock, pop, and a variety of other musical styles with equally admirable proficiency.I I considered giving this album a 4/5 because some listeners will find the blend of styles rather hard to digest. For my own tastes, though, I cannot in good conscience give Mr Bungle anything lower than a 5.If you are a music fan with eclectic tastes and the desire for something new, I'd highly recommend this, and, for a somewhat more polished Bungle sound, their album California as well."
1,Stay away from the vinyl reissue!,"A label that's got the nerve of pressing over 70 minutes of music onto one plate shouldn't get to release such titles.Stay away from all Mr. Bungle's Plain recordings 180 gram vinyls! Unfortunately they're all treated the same way...Needless to say, the CD is great."
5,"By Far, The Best Album I Have Ever Heard In My Life","If you are a musician yourself, then this is the album to listen to for inspiration. From the Les Claypool smoothness of the bass in DEADGOON to the amazing change between thrash and Beachboys like music in SLOWLY GOING DEAF, this CD never stops amazing me. Just listening to CAROUSEL inspired me to buy the movie FREAKS and watch it with the volume down and this track in the background. Absolutely amazing."
4,Touching,"Craig Armstrong's music has the tendency to set your mind drift and to think vast cinematic thoughts. which is probably why he does so many film scores. this album contains some renditions of his movie music along with some other pieces. the mood here is somber and reflective with quiet tones and some downtempo electronics added for effect. the vocal contributers are excellent (esp. Elizabeth Fraser's vocals on ""This Love""...which is the main reason why i bought this cd). one of the things i like about his music is that it comes close to being overtly emotional...but retains the distance so that the listener can sort of fill in the blanks. does that make sense?"
4,Moving music...,"Its great mood music... its not music I'd listen to whenever I'm driving, for example, but this is really dreamy, cinematic music with a contemporary sound. A great addition to my CD collection, I've never bought anything that sounded like this."
5,masterpiece,have about one thousand cds in my collection and this album is probably one of my best. Deep ambiance. very very good.
4,Nice......,"Very NICE music. I like calm and gentle music for work because I work in a place that is dangerous. I must have what few ""wits"" remain with me there or I could get hurt. So, I listen mostly to instrumental classical.I did catch ""Laura's Theme"" which is the theme from the US soap opera ""General Hospital."" I haven't watched it in about 30 years, but that was the theme written for a main character way back then. I don't even know if it is still on the air...I don't watch television or even have one plugged in. This is new music for me, and I will explore it a bit more. I like this kind of music."
4,Buchanan masterpiece revamped by Armstrong.,"Beautiful. Lush sounds, timbres that just make you want to go back to this again and again. Quite simply one the greatest musicians thats ever recorded. Buy this."
4,The best with your multicode opener,"This key-chain size remote is the best you can get for your multicode garage door. Configured and working in less than a minute. The only thing that it could have been a little more sturdy, but we'll see about that in the long run. Very good choice so far."
4,The New York Times liked this book,"On March 13, 2001 the Science section of the New York Times published a short review of this book. It describes how the entries for the various medical specialties were selected. ""For those willing to travel to find the best physician for everything, this guide serves well."" Not many of this can afford this, but the book should have a small but grateful audience."
3,Super Robot Red Baron,The red baron should move like normal robot those in others series ex: power rangers. But overall it a good series.
4,Great show!,This is one of the coolest shows that I remember when I was younger. Great action and story for the series.
1,"Great show, terrible package - subtitles go out of sync.","The show itself is great, but it's made largely unwatchable thanks to the subtitles going out of sync as each episode progresses.I've had the same problem with Mill Creek's Ultraman set and their Gamera 3 Blu-ray. Guess I'll be steering clear in the future."
5,Wendy Web Wocks!,"Wendy is one of the most versatile writers around, and I love her style and sense of humor. You can't go wrong with anything she writes, especially these innovative and unique humor-mysteries."
5,Best Concert Ever!!,Love this!!! Had it in VHS but watched it so much the video broke. Now I no longer have a VCR anyway....please make this available on DVD!!! If it was on DVD I would be first to get it!! Best show ever!!!
5,Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Manuel Guajiro Mirabal CD,I bought this CD for my son who loves it. He's very much into this music. So I was glad to add it to his collection.
2,Disappointing,Guajiro Mirabal is possibly the best of the Cubano band trumpet players. His background licks on the Buena Vista and Afro-Cuban All stars records are wonderful.This album doesn't do his talents justice.
5,Indie smartasses rule!,There aren't many people writing songs these days that will make you actually want to understand the lyrics. Catchy songs too. Slick production be damned!
5,SURPRISING!,"When I saw this band in the epitaph catalog, I was wondering what was that group. So I listened some samples of this album on cdnow and I found that looked good. Then, I decided to place an order on the album. Since I received the album, I listened to it only 2 times (I received this one only 2 days ago, December 12) but, I was amazed that I don't knew that band and nevertheless, that was as good as the most popular punk bands. If you wanna know to what their music looks like, I'd tell you they sounds like Rancid and Bombshell Rocks, and a bit like NOFX. If you like all of these or simply are a punk lover, you'll surely like this album."
4,The life and times of John F Kennedy,"Through this book, there is a better understanding of the struggles and the hardtimes that JFK was presented with. The struggle with personal life and the issues that surrounded his presidency. It was an overall nice approach to portray his life and develop a better picture and understanding in what was going on in his life."
3,Cute design but cheaply made.,"I love the design on this purse. I've had many compliments on my ""Brighton"" look purse. However, within a week of using it one of the straps came off at the stitching. It also slumps over instead of standing up straight. You get what you pay for."
3,uneven quality,"Like almost all multi-author speculative fiction story collections, this one has stories that run from the mediocre to the compelling. The best one by a long shot (but at some 35 pages more a ""novelette"" than a short story) is Tom Dupree's ""Bread Storm Rising,"" a variation on the sorcerer's apprentice motif."
3,PORNO LITE,"Was not overly enthusiastic about the film tho it had its moments. Basically it is low grade porno with all kinds of trysts including at least one girl on girl. Once again, remember the rules: Girls who have sex meet bloody demises. It is good for one viewing but that is about it."
3,Disappointing but not Surprising,"I'm a huge Donovan fan. I own all the vinyl. I still find relevance in his music. But this DVD was so disappointing. Donovan is unnatural in his narrative posture, boastful and ultimately insecure, leading me to feel queezy and embarrassed for him. He is long winded in his awkward self servitude. I'll buy a new album if it comes out, and probably give this embarrassing dvd to a fan who adores him above and beyond his legitmate musical contributions. I have seen Donovan in concert a couple of times in the last few years and sadly, his pomposity too often eminates from the stage as well."
5,Exquisite,"This is a remarkable documentary. If you've ever been a fan of Donovan, you will enjoy his thoughtful reflection on his career. This is probably one of the best documentaries on a pop star that I've ever seen. It is so thoughtfully and beautifully put together that is difficult with which to find fault. The presentation is as easy going and insightful as Donovan's music. If I have a complaint, it would be that few of the songs are presented in their entirety. It would have been grand to have been given at least one complete video of each of his songs, but that isn't how Sunshine Superman plays out, and I'm okay with that. As it is, it is a remarkable treat, and I am thoroughly satisfied with having had an opportunity to see the entire three hour production. Simply wonderful. What great insight into a creative mind, as well as the 60s."
2,DONOVAN,"EXCELLENT VINTAGE LIVE MUSIC,UNFORTUNATLY DONOVAN TALKS OVER SONGS SO YOU CANT ENJOY THEIR INTIREITY AND DOES A SING ALONG,DUH WHATEVER,WE KNOW YOU CAN SING,WOULD BE MORE LIKE 4 STAR WITHOUT THE BLAH BLAH BLAH."
5,Neo-prog at its best,"If you are a neo-progressive fan, then Jadis is a band you MUST own. The focal point of this band is Gary Chandler (vocals & guitar). Emotion, passion and heart-felt harmonies are at there best here. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Amazing to say the least! Talent beyond the punk/wave days!,"I had a cassette version of this cd and witnessed David perform this it in its entirety with the Seattle Symphony when it was released. It was probably one of the most amazing concerts I have ever seen. Watching tux stuffed, season ticket holder patrons, jaws dropping as David Byrne barked like a hyena on ""Teotihuacan"" (I think that was the cut). If only every day could be so sweet."
2,Good intentions- bad orchestration,"Great composers aren't always good orchestrators. Prokofiev often needed help. Here, David Byrne hired someone to help with the orchestration, and, to be honest, it's a horrible job. There's a lot of good music here, and some of the musical choices- such as a duet between a violin and an accordion- are very good. But this needs to be rewritten and rethought."
2,Does not perform as expected,Cable was bought mainly to use to power the IQUE M3 from my car cigaret lighter power outlet.The cable connects the power but mutes the Garmin GPS direction voice commands.Only disconnecting the cable from power brings the voice back.I find myself buying another type of cable that actually dose work properly
1,I agree with the panel,"I had to buy this book for class, but held off judgement until I had finished, however now I must agree with everyone else. There are no examples for most of the problems and as you go further in the book the authors solve more and more things exclusively with MatLab so that you have no idea how to do it alone. And since I plan to solve a lot of linear algebras problems whilst stuck on a desert island, it was very frustrating. It definately helps to have an alternate source of information when using this text in your course."
2,Already Confused?....This book won't help.,"I used the text in a Calculus 3 course for intro to DiffEq and LinAlg. While taking the class and using this text, I ended up more confused than I started. Being new to the material, the text uses to much mathematical notation for someone not acustomed to theory or different mathematical notation. In addition, the text does not provide enough examples to help digest the material. On the plus side, the book does do a good job of incorporating basic MATLAB skills, but lacks in giving any direction on how to use MATLAB. I noticed in someone else's review they suggested Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra book...I would also; the book is much more clear on the linear algebra side and is very easy to understand and interpret. For the differential equation side, I would highly recommend Boyce/DiPrima."
2,a completely useless book,"this book is confusing, the chapters are not well explained.I don't advise to buy this book to study linear algebra or differential equations. The matlab examples are not self explanatory. It lacks of good examples and does not follow an order easy to follow for the reader.I give it the 2 stars because it was very cheap. it worths what it costed (2 dollars)"
5,Popularized account of Napoleon's undoing and defeat,"Using scholarship from previous monographs, E. E. Y. Hale presents a popularized account of Napoleon's bid for power over the West in his attempt to dominate the pope and the Catholic Church. How a valiant general was essentially defeated by a modest and sickly monk-become-pope makes for a fascinating account. The book does not have a critical apparatus, but in the preface the Author refers the reader to his other works where every account in this book has been detailed and documented. Given the imprimatur (24 June 1961 +Francis Cardinal Spellman), it would seem that this small volume was put together for the general Catholic reading public."
4,Love It,"One listen & I liked it, more and I loved it. Great mixture of different types of music... Funny thing about Morcheeba is that they have a eclectic sound and every album sounds like a compilation, but with solid sounds all through. Like there is some kind of internal band conflict where there isn't a clear direction on where to go, but the distinct impression everyone has a valid opinion!"
4,an album you won't get tired of listening to.,"I actually heard this album for the first time on a beach in Goa and on first listen realized that this was a ""must buy"" ..... haven't been disappointed !"
3,PART OF THE PROCESS,I bought it on iTunes and liked it -so I wanted the complete album.Very good - I play it almost every day!Recommended. Peter
3,NOT trip hop,"After listening to this album a couple of times I thought it was ok. The track ""Friction"" justified the buy ass it is one of the best tunes I have heard this year"
1,Morcheeba Big Calm,"I was very disappointed with this cd. It was like the smooth jazz equivalent of trip hop. Very cheesy and nothing like Portishead, Povi or Lamb, which it had been compared to. If you like your electronica with a easy listening twist, then you might like this album. Otherwise, listen to Asian Dub Foundation."
5,"Massive Attack, Wax Poetic",Classic albums of this genreCopenhagen Wax PoeticBlue Lines Massive AttackOur Theory Erik Truffaz/Ilhan Ersahin
2,Big Snooze,"I was one of those people that fell into the trap of ""if you like..., then maybe you'll like Morcheeba"".WRONG. This stuff is just boring. The slow soulful stuff would work good for tv commercials but it's nowhere near as creative as Massive Attack or Lamb. The more upbeat stuff is uncomfortably cheesy. Sometimes I wonder if the Brits are making this kind of music as sort of a joke because it's too corny to be taken seriously."
4,Great Stuff,"Wow, I just love this CD. Sound blends are my new favorite thing with these types of bands. And, they give me all that I want. Great grooves and a great vocalist. Good relaxing, chill music and oh, those sound blends."
3,Nothing but short of extraordinary,I've been listening to massive attack and portishead along with Big Calm by morcheeba and i am truthfully disappointed by how much this album didnt live up to what it was said to be. Portishead's Dummy album was way better as a kind of chill and lounge music compared to Big Calm. Only buy this album if your a true Morcheeba fan and if you wont mind a little boring music.
2,not worth it,"I bought this album because i read that morcheeba was good. but after listening to the first 3 songs or so, i got irritated by the vocals. The singer's voice doesn't change and transcend through the album like Beth gibbons does in the most excellent and unnerving of ways. Spend your cash on Portishead and Massive attack, not this."
2,It just doesn't compare to other downtempo music,"There is so much downtempo available today (...). If you haven't rounded out your Massive Attack, or Portishead collections, then do that before you start on Morcheeba. If you have, then find something else to buy. This is an album that I would not play, but would not complain about if someone else did (though it may cause me to question their taste in music) (...) mine got itself sold within a month. I mean, really, buy something else... please."
1,let down,"i bought this album when the name kept popping up around portishead, and i was seriously dissaponted. Very chliché, very sappy, and they take themselves to seriously. Uninteresting, poppy sound. Pick up Mezzanine, Dummy, Love Box, or Homogenic if youre looking for intellegent trip hop. The first track isnt bad at all, but it goes downhill from there."
3,"Good, but not quite great.","I wanted something along the lines of Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead, etc., and granted this CD would fall into the same category, but it does not have the dark substance that makes Massive Attack, Tricky, and Portishead great. Good CD, a little on the lighter side."
3,Uninspiring,"This is a perfectly pleasant album, which holds the interest for only a few listens though. Music like this in my opinion is essentially easy listening which has a trendy edge to it, which gives it commercial viabilty. This is no no more than a collection of inoffensive melodies which would hardly inspire or excite many people, but would similarly not offend too many folk."
2,Weak... pod people ?,"All I have to say is, this album sounds like a bunch of Morcheeba impersonators stepped in to copy the songs off of the original album. Given many critics' criticism that even the original album sounds like a copy of the work of more seminal trip-hop artists, this is not a compliment. The rapping is okay, because it is not pervasive. But if you are really interested, eschew this poppy reinterpretation in favor of the more careful, studied original release, ""Who Can You Trust?"" ... the first has much more replay value."
4,Big Calm - Morcheeba,Morcheeba's 2nd great album....Better than the first! This album follows closely to the range of styles as the first. Its a great album and true morcheeba fans and followers will definitely need this album.
5,Smooth and hypnotic,"Rarely, very rarely, do you come across music this well rounded. The gorgeous, vibrant voice of Sky Edwards (my girlfriend says is somewhat reminiscent of Macy Gray) will captivate you from the very first track. The music is absolutely hypnotic and smooth, you will find yourself moved by the rich layers and textures which have been blended into each track. Not only this, but each track is unique, each track is recognizable and has it's own flavor; even Edwards' range of voice and emotion is different in each track (beautiful!). To top it all off is the top notch lyrics which will have you hooked. This is one of those rare CD's whose lyrics are really poetic in a sense.Compared to their first album, this one has a bit more energy, espcially on the first few tracks which, after one listen, will have you melting in your seat wanting more! Get this CD, it'll make your day."
3,Refreshing and likeable,"If you thought Sade was cool, smooth and sensous then take a listen to Sky Edwards and Morcheeba on this album. What a befitting and lovely name for a band with a kind of music as this. Not all but the few gems from this album are refreshingly soothing to your ears. The best qualities of the band can be summed up in one song, the opener ""Sea"", with excellent arrangements and beautiful singing this is the song you'll want to listen to over and over agian. ""Big Calm"" is a great concert opener. ""Let me see"" is another lovely smoothie. ""Blindfold"" is a slight digression but still manages to be in the list of good songs. Other songs can wear you down but they and the best songs on this album can give you good company on a long ride."
4,Get touchy and feely,Morcheeba is the ultimate cool pad music when you're with a loved one late at night. Slip this album on and light a few candles and let it work it's magic. Fantastic...
3,Good chill music,"Good eclectic chill lounge music. Amazing vocals!! Half the songs are excellent, the other half so so. Would definitely buy more of their albums."
5,The Word and the Image,"In lucid prose, Heffernan explores the literary trope of ekphrasis (representation of visual art in verbal art) and shows how notions of ekphrasis have changed from Homer's day to our own. This book is an absorbing investigation of the complex and often competitive relationship between visual and verbal art. An excellent and readable study of a fascinating topic, Musuem of Words is sure to be informative for both the scholar and the general reader."
2,Get the MP3 of Flower Girl and skip the rest,"Only ""Flower Girl"" holds up to repeat listening. ""Come Inside"" starts well but goes nowhere. The rest are, umm, boring. It got 2 stars only because I really like 'Flower Girl'.I have most all the TT and consider myself a fan. This release was disappointing."
1,Booooooooooooooring !,"Even ONE STAR IS TOO MUCHThe Thompson Twins WERE an interesting band.In the earlier albums, their search for musical identity and independancewas interesting and creativeand the 80s albums were certainly their best and remain the best ones to date.Especially QUICK STEP, GAP, and FUTURE DAYS.The reissues are the TT Treat to all fans.Edsel hit it right every time by the way...TT were orignal a seven set trimmed down to a trio after two endeavoursand it sounds clear that with the departure of Joe Leeway the inspiration departed alongside...Was Joe Leeway THE creative element in the set ?Queer is a very poor parent of poor and rock.The feeling is the drum machine was set from the beginning of the album ad liband the musical and singing performance do nothing for the albumbut add to the boredo(o)m !This certainly accounts for the flop.if you like or want to know about the Twins go for QUICK STEP, GAP, and FUTURE DAYS.They are great disco, pop, and dance albums you will love."
3,obliterated by the brilliance of Lost and Gone Forever,"I have to admit that my review is biased, since I believe thatLost and Gone Forever is one of the best CDs produced by any band ever.That being said, I had to destroy this CD out of my collection, because itis too similar in musical tonal qualities to The Great CD.It's like this: If you had the Mona Lisa hanging in your living room,would you hang another painting by Da Vinci right next to it? I think not.Of note, I have kept Keep It Together because that one sounds quite different thanLost and Gone Forever."
5,Guster Rocks,These guy's have played at my school (Pingry) for two years now and they are awesome and so is the CD!
5,Guster....oooh yeah,"If you haven't ever heard guster before, go run, walk drag yourself to a concert. You will not be dissapointed. The boys rock, every time, and they always have at least as much fun as the audience doing it. Both of their albums, Goldfly and Parachute are excellent, good all the way through. You won't find yourself reaching for the ""skip track"" button. Ever."
5,Fabulous sound bytes!,"""Goldfly"" is one of my very favourite cds! Every song has its own sound, it's so unique. Ryan, Adam, and Brian mesh really well together. My favourite song on the cd has to be a tie between 'Medicine', 'Demons', and 'Airport Song'.. what am I saying.. they all rock! Goldfly seems to always sneak into my discman. If you get one cd ever in your life, get this one. You won't be sorry! The harmony of their voices and their smashing lyrics will have you singing along in no time. :)"
5,One CD where I can listen to each and every song,I hate when I buy a CD and only like 2 or 3 songs on the whole thing. This is one of very few I can say I like each and every song...Its got everything from upbeat to mellow and everything in between...
3,CD's don't cut it,"Guster rocks and I've seen them perform for many years, but their CD's have yet to capture the raw power for their live performances. I'd much rather listen to a bootleg concert than the disc. I can't wait for the new disc after reading the studio journals of Brian."
2,My least favorite Guster album,"I, like many people, discovered Guster in concert. It's a good thing I did not purchase Goldfly first or I might not have bought any other of their CDs. Musically, it's a bit heavier than their other albums and I don't care for it. And the lyrics...they remind me of some of the teenage angst-ridden poetry that I wrote in high school. When I finished my first listen, I was so depressed I felt like heading to my nearest bar. If you are trying to choose your first Guster album, please pick anything else except this one. This one should best be reserved for the ""hard-core"" fans who feel they must own all of Guster's albums."
2,boring music for boring people,"i got this for free, promo, and it still is not worth the bother! the used record stores would not even buy it! not terrible, just no sign of creativity, unless you consider Dave Matthews and Jewel to be gods of the musical muse, then buy it! or go to a used store and get a copy for three bucks!"
4,german madness against a widespread clean german system,"Take a bunch of crazy German guys unsatisfied with the system, give them some clothes, a bass, a guitar, drums and some every-day life tools... Years before the Berlin wall fell, Germany already had its alternative capital junkies as we know them nowadays. This record is intelligent, hard but not difficult to listen to, absolutely exploded, serious paradoxical ironical violent and friendly at the same time. Bric-a-brac rock in its best meaning. From an Italian point of view, only Germans can be so oddily Germans in being anti-Germans. Moreover, once in a while the cunny and exilarating record covers are useful to have an idea of what's inside. A great band, unfortunately forgotten too fast."
1,I hate to be the heavy but it made my HAIR FALL OUT!,"I don't mean to be the only bad review on here, but I had to quit using this product. It was recommended to me by several people and I tried it for about 3 weeks. Yes, you don't have to use much. Yes, it lathers easily. Yes, it smells divine. But other than those 3 things, I didn't see any change in my hair other than IT STARTED FALLING OUT! Huge bald spots in my hairline so it was visible! OMG. As soon as I realized that the only change I had made recently was this shampoo and conditioner, I stopped using it immediatly and my hair stopped falling out. I just hope it grows back in sooner rather than later."
5,Good Conditioner,"I am fan.Never been disappointed with this product.I've always had stringy, dry, brittle hair and sometimes I get knots from hell. When I moved to southern California, my hair dresser recommended Enjoy to me. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner combo and was instantly impressed. I noticed a difference immediately.It smells wonderful and makes my hair feel wonderful!(My boyfriend tells me how good I smell and how mice my hair looks every time I get out of the shower...he used to never do this until i started using Enjoy.)"
5,Love it!,"My stylist used this line of products on my hair and suggested I continue to use them. For years, I've put my hair through all the usual abuse, still expecting it to look and feel healthy. I was using Dove shampoo and conditioner, as well as a leave-in conditioner. It left residue build-up, which the Enjoy line eliminates. So I'm biting the bullet and switching to a far more expensive, yet much better, line of hair products. I'm worth it!!"
2,sent wrong conditioner,Unfortunately I was sent the wrong conditioner-was in a white bottle instead of the pick one-too much trouble to return
4,Another Great LOT Album,"After the fantastic A Crimson Cosmos I did not know what to expect when I got this cd. At first I did not think it was that great but then it started to grow on me. So Fell Autumn Rain (great cello and piano) and Pagan Wish (bitchin groove & lyrics) are simply awesome songs. Forever Autumn, Homecoming, and Otherwheres are perfect for the fall season. Listening to Lake Of Tears truly takes me away to another world. It's time to light some Cosmic Weed. I give this album 4.5 stars!"
5,I love with these chaps,These are great chaps. I like that they are easy to clean and easy to put in and take off. nice and tight! These are just great to everyday use in english riding. These are one of those products that needs to be a part of your attire. New to english riding buy these there not expensive and look great. They are just Great and I love these chaps!
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE - BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered half chaps for my daughter for Easter 2010. Placed the order within 3 weeks of Easter. Never recieved item and after 7 weeks of them lying and telling me that the item was shipped and shipped, they cancelled the order and told me to go write my bad review! TERRIBLE is all I can say and my daughter still does not have her Easter present. BUYER BEWARE"
5,"Great Chaps, Great Price!","I just got these chaps last week(excellent shipping, they were three days ahead of the expected delivery!) and was impressed from the moment I got them. The suede is not cheap, like the kind you find on ankle boots at Wal-Mart. The sides are elastic and fit my calf perfectly! They fit perfect over my new boots. When I first rode with them, I was in the field and they got caked with mud. I'm talking an inch-and-a-half-coating. But, with a hose and a towel, I got almost ALL of it off! These chaps are great quality for their price, and are so worth it."
5,Horse Lovers delight,My daughter has been riding for years and she actually gave me a few comments on how comfortable this set was.
1,"Not a SACD, but a Super Saver promo c.d.! Surprise!","I really didn't expect that Bob Ludwig or Steve Hoffman or some other talented SACD engineer went back and re-mastered the master tapes from 10 different artists. So, I wasn't really surprised that this was a run of the mill red-book C.D. and it was nice to hear some songs I haven't heard in years, but...what about TRUTH IN ADVERTISING???"
1,Product NOT a kit - two heavy books!,"Thoroughly disgusted with this order. Thought I was ordering a kit to make some robots, but received two huge books for my grandson's birthday present. When I sent them back, I was charged $11.00 in postage and then did not receive my full refund because I did not fill out the correct papers which I never did see. Not happy at all with this! Did not get what I wanted and did not get my money back!"
5,"Great toy, lots of fun!",I never have seen a toy that is so entertaining for both the cat and the owner! Kinda reminds me of a fly fishing pole when you throw it...motion is a snap and then wait. Watch the cats head go back and forth as you flip it back and forth. Great toy and seems to be quality made too.
2,Cat Dancer 301,"My Georgie, wasn't interested in this toy. She spends her days begging me to throw a soft sponge ball for her, (which she retrieves like a dog), until MY arm is aching."
5,Best cat toy I ever bought,My cat loves this toy. We have a laser pointer which is fun but this is more interactive. He will jump and twirl until I put it away. It definitely will make your cat dance!
3,Cute cat toy,My cats still prefer little mice or balls/bells on the end of their cat charmers. But they are easy enough to sew on.
5,Well worth the money,I reviewed this item before...my older cat who does'nt play went wild with this teaser. She carries it around the house and loves to play with it. I bought more of this cat toy so they didn't run out of stock. I will probably buy several more!!
4,Great interactive toy.,"My cats enjoy chasing, pulling and catching the soft cloth string. But it's not something to occupy themselves with alone. Needs someone to wave it around. Good interactive toy."
3,cool looking but my cat doesn't like it,"If you have a kitten who's desperate to play with anything that moves, this might be a hit. But if your cat is older and pickier, it might like it or it might not. Mine does not. She'll take a couple of swipes at it if I dangle it around her, but after that she refuses to even look at it. Not sure if she's scared of it, just thinks it's beneath her, or what. Normally she likes a new toy and when in the mood will throw herself bodily into chasing things around. But this toy... not so much."
5,CATS GONE CRAZY,MY CATS REALLY LOVE THIS TOY. ONE OF MY CATS IS VERY OLD. SHE ACTUALLY GETS OFF HER ASS AND CHASES THIS THING.
3,It is what it is.,"Purchased as presents. Cats, kittens and kids (waving them around for the pets) like them. Well made. Nothing much else to say about the product."
5,great product,"Seems like any toy in this style would make no difference, but this toy in particular is great. I think the stripes give it visual appear and the movement possible really interests my cat."
2,A good concept but...,"I've purchased four Charmers now and we love them, but our kitty Beans might like them too much. He eats them when we leave him alone with the Charmer for too long, so a word of caution. I've even heard of certain SCPCA locations putting this toy on their black list. It's a fun toy, but kitten owners who aren't available to supervise playtime and/or remember to put the Charmer away - I would advise steering clear of this one. As much as we all love it, this is just a dangerous toy."
3,"My Cats' review: Sorta OK, but kinda HoHum...","My cats can get going with this toy, but not too hard and really kind of lose interest after only a short while. I am kind of disappointed about that because, after reading all the glowing reviews on here, I thought for sure this would be a big hit. Unfortunately, not so... My kitten chases it around a bit, then just lays down and gets tangled in it, mostly due to my efforts to revive her interest. My other cats sometimes will perk up to it for a minute or two, then just lose interest and walk away. Bummer!"
1,Danger,"My new baby kitten was choking last night - luckily I woke up and pulled a 6 inch piece of this out of her mouth and stomach! not sure how she chewed a piece off or how long it was inside of her (it was soaking wet), but good thing she was in my bedroom or she might not have made it! My cats do love this toy - about 6 months ago I found a two inch piece inside some of my older cat's poop....guess I should have thrown it away then!!"
2,"Product is good quality, but cat doesn't like it","Everyone's cat is different -- my cat happens to go crazy with feather toys and other things he can chomp on (rather than laser pointers). For some reason, he doesn't like this toy at all. He just stares at it without interest. The product is OK quality and the shipping was efficient -- but just keep in mind that not ALL cats love this thing. I've had better luck with Da Bird."
4,My Cats Love It,"I bought this after adopting a couple feral cats. It is cute, in expensive and is easy to use. It arrived quickly but there was way more packaging that this little toy needed. I came in a box that was at least 20x the size of the toy - kind of wasteful. Otherwise great."
4,4 Stars,Cats love it! Certain cats may not like this type of toy as they like to have the small ones to kick and scratch around with.
5,Loads of Kitty Fun!,"Though cats are usually very easy to entertain, this product was so nicely priced, I couldn't resist buying it for my little furry children. I would like to point out that the fabric is durable enough to withstand three cats that still have their claws, and a dog that thinks he's a cat. It's easy to hand wash and there's absolutely nothing to complain about."
5,Effective cat toy,"I've bought many toys that go neglected, but this one gets cats to play. My elderly cat loves it and we now have several play sessions a day. The exercise is good for her."
1,Very disappointing cat toy,"This cat toy is very disappointing. My grandson was playing with it and his cat and it wrapped itself around the cat and wouldn't let go. His mother finally had to cut the ""cat dancer"" off of the cat!!! It was like a strong adhesive grabbing on to the pet. We threw this cat toy away. Don't waste your money."
1,Cat Afraid,My 3-month-olds cat doesn't intrest. She is totally afraid with this. She is running and hiding in the corner when she saw this.
5,DEAD OR ALIVE STILL ROCKIN'!,"AWESOME 80's classic that will take you right back to the dance floor! Immediately, before even listening to it, I loaded into my itunes library. Can't wait to take a nice, long walk with this nostalgic music!"
1,My cat didn't like it at all,"I bought this because it was reviewed so highly but my cat didn't like it at all. She examined it, poked at it, laid on it but refused to play with it. When I picked it up and tried to coax her she ran.To be fair she is a timid kitty from a shelter-I think she was abused so the rod the charmer is attatched to may scare her."
1,Supervised Playtime Only,"In fairness, this is a great interactive toy. Unfortunately, I didn't think to put it away. While I was at work my cat chewed the string off and swallowed it. I assumed the kids broke it, and kitty died about a month later at the end of a long and expensive surgery."
2,Too short for serious ribbon routines,"I was first drawn to the charming dancer ribbon 301 because of the coloration. Many have noticed a lack of flair in my usual dance ribbon (transitioning from jet black to charcoal grey as you move along its length). While flair was no longer an issue (Thanks Cat Dancer!) the weight of the ribbon felt frivolous and the length insufficient. Using this product during my patented ""Rain Dance"" routine did not allow me to ""drizzle"" along the floor and ""soak"" the audience as I can with my longer ribbons. All in all, fun for a while, but not for any serious Ribbon Dance Routines, unless you are a junior dancer or have short arms."
1,If you're crafty don't waste your money,"What you see is exactly what you are getting. This is an 18"" flexible plastic wand with a long strip of colorful fleece attached to it. The fleece is slightly wider where it attaches to the wand and narrows down at the end to something resembling a tail. It will keep a cat entertained no doubt about it. But if you have the time, go down to the dollar store buy a kids cheap plastic wand, attach about 50 cents worth of fleece (approximately 2.5 feet) with electrical tape and you will have the exact same thing. My cat loves it and I am not going to waste my time shipping the stupid thing back.But I am willing to warn others about what a waste the thing is. Perhaps I will go into business selling these things myself, even at half the price I would still make a profit."
5,Everything I ask for in a cat toy.,"My 15-pound cat goes nuts for it, it's held up really well for months, and it doesn't shed little feather bits on the rug. So it's pretty much all I wanted in a cat toy."
4,Lots of interaction,"Both my cats love chasing this ""fleece"" string-toy. Keeps them interested for a long time, and they haven't destroyed it yet."
4,"first time playing they love it, slowly lose interest","the first time i used this they went insane over it, it was very powerful and made one of them very aggressive with the other cats. now that it's been a week or so they are slowly starting to lose interest in it but they still play with it, but they won't chase after it like before, that's why it gets a 4 star rating instead of 5! otherwise it's great"
2,This thing sucks,"I cannot get much play time with this toy at all because every time my cat tries to bat at it, he gets his claw stuck in the stupid flannel material and I have to unhook him. It makes it no fun and my cat agrees."
2,Not as interesting to my older cat,"My cat is a bit old, she's over ten years old as of this writing. I mention this because I think it might be her age as to why she's not interested in this very much. She will play with it a little bit, but she loses interest pretty quick. Still, it's a pretty cheap toy and it does get some use."
2,not thrilled,"My kitten is not as interested in chasing this as in eating it. Even while we are holding the stick she has managed to get some good bites of it. The stick has been useful, though, for retrieving her furry mice and little plastic balls from under the radiators. Otherwise, the toy came as advertised."
2,There are better toys,I purchased this on-line along with the Cat Dancer. My cat is not really wild about this toy. He will play with it for about two minutes with me but he would rather us be playing with his Cat Dancer.
1,Don't buy you will never get it,It's been 3 months and I haven'tEven got it don't buy this waste of money and when I trak it says they can't trak it
5,Cats love it (the active ones anyway),"I've been buying these for a long time, but then the local pet stores started carrying the cheaper brands that just do not have the same quality as the Cat Charmer, so I quit buying them. Then, I found 'em on Amazon and ka-pow, the active kitties are a jumpin' and huntin' and chasin' this thing all over the place. Super product and ""debnroo, inc."" packed it WELL! Super A+"
3,Don't leave cats alone with it,"I've had this toy for about 7 months and the cats love it, but they definitely CAN chew it up if given the chance! The thick, stretchy fleece does hold up against claws and teeth for awhile. Then I discovered one of them after he'd eaten about a foot of it, and realized they've been gnawing off the end for a few weeks or months. Almost four days out and he seems to be fine (eating and eliminating normally) but this has been stressful and I'll probably take him to the vet if he doesn't pass it soon. I was aware that cats and thread did not mix, but I kept this toy around because I never thought it was stringy enough to end up inside of them. I was wrong! Don't leave them alone with it."
4,Cat Loves it Too Much,"Both my cats love playing with the toy. The younger one has an obsession with string and if given the opportunity will eat it. Several times I have turned my back for a second and found a chunk chewed off the end. Then the next day she throws up brightly colored fabric. She loves playing with it too much to take away completely. If your cat has this quirk be warned that this toy is very appealing. My other cat does not have this issue. The toy does not seem breakable, just edible. Be warned that the fabric does stretch a good deal if the cat likes to tug on it. Until you know how your cat reacts, I would recommend very close supervision as suggested by the instructions."
4,Cats Love it,"It was a great deal for the price and my cats love it (although my finicky male cat got bored of it quickly, my playful female kitty can't get enough)I only wish it were a little longer so that I could get them running all over the house (when I run around too much it freaks them out)."
4,Cat Charmer Review,Neat toy to play with your cats. Soft yet strong. Your cat can hang or pull on it without it breaking. You will get your cats attention immediately upon shaking it on the floor.
5,Unique toy -,"My cats love it too much. I save it to use especially when I need to distract them from mischief - nothing works as good as this. The only problem they want to chew on it so have to limit their play time with it. It looks simple but there seems to be something magical in the tapered, exact length, and strecty fabric that they can't resist."
4,Good toy at a great price.,"As many have stated before, the simplest toys are usually the best when it comes to our furry friends. My parents own a cat that loves the charmer, though she does get tired of playing with it by herself, so if your cat is anything like ours be ready to spend some time ""charming"" your feline to get the most out of the toy.The actual product is well made and hasn't suffered any damage despite some rather hard pawing, tugging, and biting. Solid."
5,Cat dancer,"My cats love this toy, especially my female. She flies through the air to catch it and enjoys playing so much. My 17 lb. male will lay on the floor and wait until it gets close to him before he tries to catch it."
5,Interactive,"I haven't met a cat yet that doesn't like this toy. Depending on how you play with it, your cat can be a gymnast or a hunter. It's soft and has great movement."
4,My cat loves this toy!,"Received this very fast & was a great deal from Amazon. My cat loved it immediately! Like all Cat Dancer products...it is well made & this one is especially safe. The wand is strong & the ""snake"" portion seems to be attached very well & covered with a rubber tip. The fabric material stretches & seems impossible to get torn. I wanted to order a bunch of these for friends with cats, but when I went back to the site on Amazon, the price had increased, so I did not get any more. I'll look around other sites for a better price. The product deserves 5 stars, but because of the price increase I have to give it only 4 stars."
2,Cat gives it 1 star,"Just not that interested.... ""another string on a stick? REALLY? I am supposed to be thrilled with this? Puh-leez!"" seems to be his reaction. If I annoy him with it he'll swat at it and walk away. It is colorful and soft though!"
3,Meh,"Cat is not super excited about this toy, even when sprinkled abundantly with cat nip. Alas he prefers to shred the couch instead..."
3,I get the same reaction from pieces of string.,"One the one hand, it's only about five bucks, and a cat's happiness is priceless, right?On the other hand, it's cheap, ugly, and elicited the same kind of response from my cat that seeing a picture of a bird in a magazine causes in her; an initial vague curiosity, passing slight interest, then complete boredom, all in the span a minute or so.But hey, it's good to give cats variety, and the extra exercise that your feline gets from this toy, even if it's only a small amount, is helpful in keeping them healthy and happy. But it's just so average and blase that I can't help but think I could have spent my five dollars on a can of catnip and made her a whole lot happier, a whole lot easier."
2,Negative,My older cats don't care about it. I would like to get my money back but its $3 so thats it.
1,Worked for one day,"Everyone says it lasts through everything. Well, our kitten had fun with it all day and then shredded it that night."
2,My cat isn't too enthusiastic about this,I got this shipped all the way to Dubai after reading all the good reviews about it. To my surprise my cat isn't really interested in it. He will play for 10 seconds and then turns around. I thought he would like this as he goes absolutely nuts for the feather wand. Big disappointment.
3,"Great, Overpriced Cat Toy","Yes, the reviews are true: cats LOVE this toy, mine more than many others they ""own."" But it's also true that Cat Charmer is overpriced. Just because the toy is a hit with cats doesn't mean customers should be ripped off. So, four stars for a great toy and one star for the price. All I can add is that the product better have a long life."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this at the time as the chicken, what a disappointment! It is just a piece of fabric with a handle! Make it yourself."
2,Our cat doesn't care ...,"We have had this some months now. Our cat was mildly amused for a minute or two, but didn't really go after it. She really goes for the kind that has a stick and some object at the end of a long string attached to the stick."
5,A favorite!,"This toy has turned out to be such a hit for both my boyfriend's cat and my cat. Between this and the catnip-filled carrot, they're happy as little furry clams. ;)"
2,joy ran out real fast,I had high hopes for this toy given the many positive reviews but my 3 cats got bored with this toy in less than an hour. The toy itself is well made and seems very safe but I guess mileage will vary depending on your cats.
2,"Kinda cheap, not all cats like it","It comes as a piece of fleece on a pole that is too short (shorter then the picture looks), you have to be standing next to your cat to get it above them. I could see the pattern on the material but it didn't interest my 2 grown cats that much. One cat sprints after a laser pointer for minutes at a time but the cat charmer didn't hold her interest for long. The other cat is more laid back and didn't care for it.I bought two other cat toys at the same time to test them out.The cat dancer metal wire thing Cat Dancer, didn't hold the cats interest much either and has awkward to hold. The movement is pretty random but they didn't go for it.Da birdDa Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy (easy store pull apart rod)had a nice design that made the feathers spin while in air. The pull apart rod was sturdy enough and let you manage up close with it. Interested my lazy cat to bat it, he liked feathers as a kitten so these toys probably work best when introduced young."
5,Our cats favorite!,"We adopted two shelter kittens, and being ""newbies"" bought a collection of several types of cat toys..this is hands down the favorite of both kittens, and it was one of the least expensive! It is better than the ""feather"" versions, b/c nothing falls apart and the handle is flexible rather than super stiff plastic. Overall, this is well made and a great buy :)"
5,Loves it!,My cat lovesss this thing. He carries it around at night in his mouth crying for someone to play with him ha. So cute
3,not sturdy enough.,The idea is great. The cats loved it while it lasted. Unfortunately they bit pieces off the first day of use and it continued to shrink each day of subsequent use.
5,Cats go Crazy!,"I have 3 cats of various ages. They all love this toy. Granted, it is an interactive toy. You, the cat's owner, must play with the cat! It gives the furry little darlings lots of exercise if you want to walk around with it and have them chase it, or you can just sit and make them dance around with it. All 3 of mine love it! The youngest one grabs the felt with her claws and doesn't want to let go. We can drag her around the tile floor with it if we want to, it's that strong. Even our 15 year old will get up and ""dance"" a little. Well worth the money!"
4,The only toy my cats will ALWAYS get up for when they see it,"My cats absolutely LOVE this thing. More than any other toy I have ever owned. They will leap up and run over as soon as they see me touch it. However, the one big drawback is that playtime tends to end fast, because as soon as they catch it their claws will stick right in the fabric, so there is no getting it back."
5,BEST EVER!,"My little old lady of eight ADOreS this simple thing! What a wonderful find! She is so perscnickety....but this one ""gets"" her...if it get her, it will get your kiddlies too! I would like to add though that these should NEVER be left for kitty to play with unattended...becuase of the stretchy, elastic nature of the material, there is a potential for kitty to get it wrapped around the neck, etc and not be able to get undone (figured this out i first play session). other than that, it is a WoW and a must for kitties that are too sedentary and hard to entice to play."
3,requires supervision,"cats love this toy, of course. mine loved it too much and would drag it around day and night until i came home one day and saw that she had eaten most of it the ribbon.luckily she puked it up two days later and we didn't have to take her to the vet, but it could've been bad.don't assume your cat won't eat it too. just keep it in a drawer and take it out at playtime."
3,Fun but dangerous,"Every cat I've ever tried this on loves it. It's a great toy from that perspective.However, I was shocked to discover one day that the fabric ribbon was gone. I found it in the litterbox a day later... It can be very dangerous for cats to swallow something like this if it gets caught inside.So, make sure to store this toy somewhere cats can't get it when you aren't actually playing with them."
3,Pretty good toy,"My two Egyptian Mau kitties loved this toy when I first unpackaged it. They had a great time chasing it and watching it twirl. The problem is after they caught it a few times and tried to run off with it, the material stretched and now the 'snake' is too long to make an effective toy for them. This problem can easily be solved simply by cutting off a foot or two of the material, but eventually you will be left with just a stick! Anyway, my cats love it and it is one of the more cost effective toys for cats out there"
4,Cat loved...but must be supervised!,"My cat loved this toy. But you must supervise them. My cat actually ate part of the ""ribbon."" I was lucky it came out without a visit to the emergency room. So, great toy to use with your cat. But don't leave it lying around."
4,Longer than expected,"Overall good quality toy and my kittens like it a lot, but I was surprised by how long the ribbon is (at least 1.5 feet long)"
5,Best Cat Toy Ever!,"We have 6 cats and 5 of them love this toy. (The exception is the 19 year old and she only likes sunny windows, warm meals, and warm laps. She has no interest in anything else.)When I begin playing with one of the cats the others hear what is happening and come running to join in the fun. It gets a bit crazy trying to give each one enough play time and keep them from pouncing on each other as they jump to catch the toy. I have even seen the youngest play with it alone by biting the string and dragging it to another room.I purchased this a few months ago and it has held up well. I've been buying cat toys for years and no other toy has generated this much interest. Highly recommended!"
5,Strong and fun,"When I first started using it, I thought it seemed weak and would not last very long. But to my surprise it actually is a lot stronger that it looks. The cats pull on it very hard and it holds up very good. It's good for 15 min or so of fun. I put it up and then take it out every few days. The Cats always enjoy it. I would recommend it."
5,Awesome!,This is a great toy to play with a cat.... Hours and hours of enjoyment! Made well and appears to be holding up.
5,Fun even for an old cat,"Purchased for a 13 year old cat who exercises very little. However, even she enjoyed this toy! I would recommend it!"
5,Happy Cats!,The two cats have a ball with there new toy! They could spend hous playing with it and I think the colors really attract them.
3,OK but not as good as a bird pole,"My cat likes this toy fine but she doesn't go crazy for it like she does for the bird pole (a pole attached to a string with a feather lure on the end). She will very rarely leap into the air after it. I have to drag it along the ground away from her to get her interested (which involves a lot of work on my part since it means I can't stay in one place) and then she pins it and her claws get stuck in it. A declawed cat might enjoy it more because the ribbon would just slip through its paws. With my cat it is sort of a pain to use. It's more fun just to tie it around her and watch her try to run out of it. Not sure how fun that is for her, though. Next stop, laser pointer."
4,The Cat Charmer,"This toy has regular entertainment possibilities for cat and human. I get to sit and flip the snake like shape and the cat stalks while I am entertained by his antics. It gives variation to the playthings and I like being able to sit while playing allowing all the activity to come from the cat. I can't say the toy is our cat's favorite but it has never been totally ignored. Once he gets into the game of stalk the snake it can last long enough to wear me out. It's a decent toy, worth its inexpensive price tag."
5,WAY more durable than I thought it would be,"When I first got this I was a little skeptical because the dangly part is made of fleece. I figured my Maine Coon would destroy this thing within a week. The toy is still going strong 2 months later though, and at this point any extra lifespan is bonus as far as I'm concerned. He has even tried to chew the part that connects the dangly fleece to the plastic stick, and it has held fast. My cat goes berserk for this thing, and when he catches it he refuses to let go until you do, at which point he carries it into a corner and sits on it."
5,Popular,The cats love it. The only problem has been getting the youngsters to lay off so that the older adults can get a chance to play. Lots of fun for the money.
5,The cats Love it!,"I have two cats, one who loves to eat shoe laces and such, but this product is great because she cant seam to eat through the felt, which is great! Both cats seek this toy out and love to play with it. It is light and doesnt hurt wrist or elbow when you flip it around. And good exercise for the cats!"
5,My cat loves it!,I can't believe how much my cat enjoys playing with this simple toy. He will even go onto to the table and nudge it to get me to play with him.
5,Cats love it,This thing drives my cats insane. They really love it and get excited every time it is pulled out. Even my older 15yr old cat loves this thing and chases it around.
3,Toys,Some what disappointed thought it was on a stand but they do like it now at least they get bored easy
3,This toy probably varies from cat to cat.,"My 6 month old kitten seems to find this toy really interesting at times. However, I've noticed he seems to decline my invitation to play with it more often than any of his other ""wand-style"" toys. He shows virtually no interest at all in playing with it on his own. If he does enjoy it own his own accord, it's not for more than a minute or so. Having said that, I can understand that some cats might just adore it. There have been times when my little one seems thrilled with everything about it when we're swinging it together. In addition, while I see the benefit to the toy being so long, I also think it's almost too long for us. It's a little intimidating when your cat can never ""catch it"", no matter how hard they try. It also gets tangled fairly easily. So, in the end, I would say it's probably the perfect toy for some feline friends, but easy to completely ignore for others."
4,"The cat loves it, then his interest wanes...","It's a great product. I managed to entertain my cat for weeks (that's a lot of play time since I spend at least an hour a day, sometimes more, playing with him). However, after the first rush of madness wears off, he is ignoring it now. Oh well. I think I am going to hide it for a few weeks and then take it out again to see how it works. Highly recommended!"
5,help for troubled kitty,"I adopted a troubled shelter cat. She hid behind a bookcase. Food,water,nothing would tempt her. But she can not resist this toy. I have lured her to food, interaction , physical affection & even a little grooming with this toy. When she gets overly anxious,I bring out the dancer and she forgets to be upset and has fun instead. It has been a blessing for a troubled kitty who is coming along nicely. 5 meows!"
2,"So-so print quality, low page count","I've bought several different generic HP Q2612A (or sometimes just known as 12A) toner cartridges, and this is the first one to disappoint. Print quality out of the box was never great - always a bit uneven, even after I would take it out and shake it vigorously. Quality deteriorated after about 1,000 pages, and I'll be replacing it without even reaching 2,000 pages. It was at least cheap (under $15), but I'm going to look elsewhere."
1,"Wasted paper and ink, destroyed copies","I have owned my HP 1020 Laser Jet printer for several years and always used the genuine HP cartridges which are prohibitively expensive, but reliable. I decided to try this cartridge based on the reviews to cut my costs and ordered two of them several months ago. The first one has been a nightmare and I doubt the second will be any different. It prints dark 1/4 inch horizontal black bands every three inches. I thought it might go away after the first few printings, but it has not. I am going to throw these things away and hope the cartridge did not permanently destroy my printer."
5,"A faithful mailman, who gets a cold and finally his own mail","I'm giving this a book a 5 star based on the reaction of my 3 children to the book when each of them discovered it at the age of 3-5 years old. The message and illustration is clear and folksy. A gentle, faithful mailman (who happens to be a dog) and longs for his own mail, delivers a birthday package to Bobby Beaver on a cold and rainy night, then gets a bad cold. His get well letters come in a big sack of mail and there ends the tale. The type is large enough for the child to eventually read on their own and they want to!! This book is similar in tone, simplicity and clarity to Maurice Sendaks Little Bear, or Mazy the Mouse. A quiet refuge for the young and their protectors in an often hectic world. I'm surprised there aren't more books and merchandise for this character, it should be and probably will be a classic one day."
5,One of the favorites at our house!,This is such a sweet story with opportunity to show children how to encourage others. Our 2 year old loves it and asks for it over and over. Why is this not on the classics list yet?
5,"Love, love, love",Not only is the movie one of my faves but so is the soundtrack. I have an addiction to buying soundtracks and this one tops the list of my many. Its so good I'm using a few of the tracks for my wedding.
5,Party on Marie,"I saw the movie, loved the music and had to buy the soundtrack. Both discs are great. A mixture of 80's music and music of today, with a dash of classical. Great soundtrack."
4,A Great Collection of Music,"I heart Sophia Coppola and her films. But I have always loved the soundtracks better than the movies. Maybe if she would apply the same attention to the film as she does the music, she would have a complete package.These songs are a great blend of mellow, classical songs, as well as energized rock outs. If you are having a bad day, these cds will change your mood. The collection is strong and lively. And 2 cds for this price is a great deal.The Strokes have my favorite song on the cd. I highly recommend for adventurous and eclectic tastes!"
4,A great anthology of song,A great mixture. Recommended to my daughter who composes music and she lovedthe original soundtrack. Movie also good but soundtrack great.
1,I am desapointed,"It's poor, I thought it could be better, but it's a mistake, the songs are not what I really like in the soundtrack.At least, i left someone that I like so much:- TRAINPOTIING- HOUSE OF AMERICA- TRACKSPOTTING- HIGHT FIDELLITY- VELVET GOLDMINE- 24 HRS PARTY PEOPLE (AMAZING)- I SHOT ANDY WARHOL!!!THAT'S IT!"
1,Clueless music for a clueless movie,"Ugh. Siouxie was never cool, ok? Adam and the Ants? Like a parody of 80s music. And wtf do the ridiculously artificial Strokes have to do with any ""80s"" aesthetic?With every movie, Coppola demonstrates how completely out of touch she is, was, and always will be. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
4,Awesome,I absolutely love the soundtrack. The way the CDs were broken up was magnificent and created two distinct and enjoyable CDs that I think sound better separate than they would jumbled together.
1,if you are looking to hear them.....,"If you are looking for a cd with these three compositions on it, to hear them, this is the cd for you! I have yet to see the d'indy and Fantasy Trio on a cd, non-the-less on the same cd. The performance seemed lack-luster and unthoughtout/unclear."
5,I love this book!,"I had very basic knowledge of actionscript and I've only designed some basic pages with Flash before I purchased this book. I was afraid that this book would be hard to understand since I'm not a programmer at all, but it isn't. I'm only at the beginning but I'm really enjoying it so far. Things that I couldn't understand by reading the Flash reference I could totally understand now. The tutorials are great too!"
4,Great Book,"William B. Sanders and Mark Winstanlet have put together a remarkable little book that serves as a terrific intro on connecting Flash to a database. Clear but dense, this is no""quick read"" - however, you will walk away marveling at how easily Flash can connect to a database, and wondering why it is not used more often as an application development (as opposed to graphics/animation) tool on the web. In particular, the Flash, PHP, MySQL combo is simply awesome.Bill Saunders, got back w/in an hour regarding a question on one of the examples. He is my favorite ""Flash"" author. Check out Flash FX and Design by Saunders as well. Best book on ActionScript for the money."
5,"At Last , a book even a designer can understand.","As a graphics person, I've tried for months to understand scripting and databases with no success, I was just about to throw in the towel and literally go back to the drawing board when I found this book. The authors make these subjects easy to understand and the tutorials are excellent for bridging the graphic person's need to see the concepts in action. I've never written a review before, but this book has finally made me understand and given me the tools to move forward."
3,Mixed bag,"There are few books that address the server-side aspect of Flash. And even fewer of them that are well written. This one covers XML pretty well. It also covers some scripting languages, each with a specific database. Unfortunately this book misses the one scripting language that is the current focus of all Macromedia work: ColdFusion. It also misses the databases that are mostly used with ColdFusion: SQL Server and Oracle. ColdFusion MX is coming out soon and will tight the integration of Flash with ColdFusion on the server side. And what will then happen to this book?"
1,Not worth it.,"There is nothing new in this title.Topics are gleaned from a myriad of other books, nothing original here.With such a great topic there is a lot of room to write something of substance but after the first few chapters you can see the authors were more impressed with having their names appear in all of the code and examples.To really learn get a middleware book (ASP/PHP/whatever [try Wrox Press]) and the Colin Moock ActionScript book, these two will take you to the next level of Flash development."
4,Twists and Turns,I remember this as one of the better Morse books because it features a mystery that is extremely difficult to solve along with the usual exceptional character development. This is a work not to be missed in the series.
4,Stories Without Words,"My sister Madeline introduced me to these ruthlessly innovative fellows twenty years ago. They were pioneers in digital recording technology and used the new flexibilities of the medium to great effect. They placed demands on the capabilities of digital recording and pushed the envelope to places we had thought unattainable.And then we went even further. They established and exceeded a goal of telling wondrous stories with their music, which would be told, almost entirely, without lyrics. My favorite cuts on this collection include the first cut, ""Universe of Two,"" which tells such a joyful tale with such an amazingly ambiguous cast of sadness.There was never anything else that came close during the dawn of the ""new age."" This album belongs in your collection for sheer listenability."
3,Not Bad but...,"This isn't a bad book, just not a great book. Nothing you haven't read before. Also, I'd prefer to read a book that doesn't shamelessly promote products (Mossy Oak camo). This book also contradicts itself in several places (for example the section on hunting by the moon or the section discussing how bucks travel on trails parallel to doe trails). It's an enjoyable read, particularly for a beginner, but it really left me wanting for more."
4,A pioneer in mental health and nutrition,"This is one of the first books to support the link between good nutrition and better mental functioning. I was impressed with the studies and experiments that indicated the problems of depression being linked with low blood sugar and schizophrenia linked with white flour allergies. Dr. Fredericks describes how the two basic metabolisms, Fast Oxidizers and Slow Oxidizers have different nutritional needs. (This theory is similar to Oz Gracia's Fast, Slow and Mixed Burner categories in the book, The Balance.) Dr. Fredericks also gives case studies where people with emotional disturbances were able to ""cure"" themselves with mega dosages of supplements such as vitamin B1 or extra amounts of sleep. This book is well-written and sheds some light on body chemistry and mental/emotional health. You might save a trip to the pharmacist and find some solutions to your own personal problems.Doug Setter, Bsc. author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide"
3,Hidden Treasures found!,"Sugar Minott, what can you say about the man, he just hasn't got the props that is due to him. A genius musician and creative talent out of JA that still rivals with the best of them. This album features an array of artists through several periods of time. The stand out feature on this album is the talent that Minott produced these songs for...Johnny Osbourne has a brilliant modern roots song Rope In Rasta, Horace Andy, Every Tongue Shall Tell, African Bros. Father Lead Us, Sly & Robbie War Power and the Dub. Excellent tunes from obscure artist, Jr. Roots' Natty Dread Time, ""Progress"" by Barry Brown, all show Minott's ability to tap into the very best in an artist. The albim can be a bit too mix match, but offers a steady flow. Big Up bro. Minott!"
3,"So so set, but cheap","This set is all right. The blades are wide and not very flexible. There are manufacturing marks on the blades, giving them a wavy appearance. The handles are attached well, though. Lots of parts for the price."
2,Dull as dishwater,"This books falls into the trap Turtledove set for himself a decade ago with the Worldwar series: multiple characters providing sequential viewpoints of history as it happens. And it's gotten dull and boring.This isn't quite as boring and uninteresting as the latest 2 or 3 of his Great War books (the latest of which I couldn't even finish), but it's nowhere near Turtledove's best work. Believe me, he can write an interesting story when he bothers to try. See under: Ruled Brittannia.Example in point: the book starts off with the Battle of Pearl Harbor. You'd expect some excitement to the scene. It's a surprise attack, for gosh sakes, with defenders in a panic and attackers exulting in their success. But somehow the entire sequence seemed incompletely drawn and at the end of I found myself yawning and wondering what was on TV."
3,Better Than Most of His Recent Books,"This is a solid alternate history novel based on the premise that the attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by a successful Japanese invasion of the Hawaiian islands. Turtledove uses his conventional multiple characters/plot threads style to construct a panoramic view of this alternate history. The recency and massive documentation of WWII provides Turtledove with a rich resource for unfolding events. Essentially, he has shifted much of the Pacific War eastwards. Doolittle's raid on Tokyo becomes a raid on Honolulu. The Battle of Midway becomes an American attempt to retake the Hawaiian islands, which the Japanese victorious. Probably the best feature of this book is the depiction of racism on both sides. Turtledove shows well how Asian-Americans were second class citizens in pre-war Hawaii and also shows the brutal ethnocentrism of the Japanese."
2,Too Diffuse,"Turtledove is beginning a series here, but in order to do so he is having to depart considerably from credible history. The idea of having a Japanese invasion of Hawaii mounted and then succeed is an interesting one, but he then ignores the historical record on how/why the war in the Pacific began to turn so quickly in the U.S.'s favor in order to keep the narration up in the air. A one novel treatment would have been far stronger and probably would have been less diffuse as he could have eliminated the characters he is setting up to use in future novels of the series. I doubt I'll be reading them."
3,"Good... but, not great","Unfortunately, this seems to be heard more and more about Dr. Turtledove's work. I wish my take on this book was different.The premise is a good one. The Japanese take Hawaii... ok, but with only one division?I realize that American airpower was not a factor after the opening of the campaign, but air superiority or no, The available American forces should have been able to better than that. Alright, I understand the suspension of disbelief, so I'll move on.I just don't see that this series, for I am certain that there will be more, is going to do it for me. Oh, I'll read it alright, but I suspect it will be more of the same pro forma stuff.C'mon Harry!, show us the brilliance that we know you possess!"
1,"Lame, just like the Left Behind series",this whole tale just repeats over and over and over. page after page as you slowly crawl through the story. Do oyurself a favor and pass on this guy.
3,Radar,Radar was a British invention and the British refused to share it with the USA. So this little anachronism might marr the story a bit .
1,Boooring!,"Not quite as bad as ""In The Presence Of Mine Enemies"", but almost as one dimensional when it comes to character development and really slow in advancing the story.Although one could believe that the Japanese could have invaded the islands, it is hard to believe they could have done it as quickly and with as little loss of lives and materiel. There are repetitious scenes of the japanese father and his two sons on the fishing sampans, of the american woman working in her assigned garden, of prisoners in compounds, of japanese fliers,etc.,etc. There is no end to the story and a lot of the characters are left hanging in the air; all plenty of reasons to believe in more sequels to come and more readers to bore.There are plenty of other authors who have penned better alternative history novels!"
3,12/7/1941 - Alternate History,"Turtledove hits on another creative idea concerning the original ""Day of Infamy"" by having the Japanese land troops on the Hawaiian islands on the day following the air attacks. I bought the book because I thought this plot was clever. However, in my opinion, the author spends too much time giving many intimate details about each of the large number of characters. I have found this a distraction. I have completed the book and begun reading the sequel which seems to continue in the same vein.I have read several other books by this same author, many of which contain these same extensive character details. To me, ""Days of Infamy"" goes overboard with them."
3,Haven't we read this book before?,"Stock characters (down to the fair skinned guy who sunburns easily, and therefore is in the Navy and posted to someplace tropical, the 'outsider' trying to fit in despite being looked down on by the WASPs, ....), yet another alternate WWII (what if the Japanese took Hawaii from a USA that lost the Civil War, then the aliens invade), etc."
4,Good WW2 alternate history story.,"Days of Infamy is set on Hawaii, in December 1941. In this story the Japanese follow up their airborne attack on Pearl Harbour, with a land invasion. I thought it was a gripping and exciting read, for the most part. The battle scenes, both in the air and on land are very vividly described, and the author seems to know his stuff, with regards to the planes, tanks, guns etc., that were used at this time.The book is not quite as exciting, when the fighting ends, but is still quite interesting, as you wonder how the inhabitants of the island, and in particular the American POWs, will cope under Japanese rule. I look forward to reading the sequel."
3,Needs An Ending,"Maybe the author does it all the time but I need a satisfying ending to any book I read. Even stories that span multiple books should have a satisfying ending in each. Putting that aside, the story is quite interesting and entertaining."
3,Good...but incomplete,"Harry Turtledove's latest, _Days of Infamy_, is up to his usual standards, but be warned - it's not complete; in fact, there's no real ending to the book. This is almost certainly because it's the first in a new series. For somebody who's been reading Turtledove as long as I have, this is actually something of a red flag, because Turtledove's great failing as a writer is his prolixity; if you give him enough space, he'll use ten words where one would have done just as well, and he has a rather dismaying tendency to repeat himself in his mega-series. He's at his best where he has to work within the framework of a single book (_The Guns of the South_, _Ruled Britannia_, _In the Presence of Mine Enemies_, _A World of Difference_, etc.) If you're a Turtledove fan, by all means buy this book - but don't be disappointed if you find yourself wondering at the end, ""Is that all?"""
1,Not his best...,"I admit that I look forward to anything written by Dr. Turtledove. He is a great writer, and his stories always make you think. However, this one left me a bit disappointed. The story is feasible, instead of attacking the fleet, the Japanese invade Hawaii. In fact, not much imagination is required to imagine the treatment of civilians and POW. Frankly, none at all, everything they do in the imaginary Hawaii of the story, they did in fact in Singapore, Hong Kong and innumerable other places.The story has some good points (like the launching of the 3rd wave by Nagumo against the fuel farms, etc. [don't want to ruin the plot]). However it falls short on other areas (even without Hawaii, we did break the encryption codes). I honestly would have preferred him finishing the World Wars story (with the human race ""visiting"" the home world), a book I believe is out in December.Frankly, I'd wait for this one to be available at the library, we deserve better."
2,Buy the newer PTs,"While I enjoy ll materials LSAT, this test is simply not in line with the current LSAT and not worth the purchase. For example, it has a pattern game in the LG and 2 question prompts in the LR. While it is possible that these forms will make a comeback, given their lack of use for 10+ years, the odds are against that. Spend you hard earned money on more relevant material like a recent PT OR buy on of the $20 books with 10 tests."
2,"Really, You Gotta Be Kidding Me","Am I four? Redundant and repetitious, this is like reading an early kindergarten book with definitions of sentences- unnecessary at best. Save your money unless you read at a first grade level."
2,TOO FAR FROM THE MIKE,"The music is great and it IS Jimmy Buffet, but the technical side of this really reeks--the mic is so far away from Jimmy and so close to the band that really, you can't hear him very well. Of the live cds that I have heard, this is the pits. Try something else: don't waste your money on this one. Sorry to have to say that because I adore Jimmy Buffet."
4,good,"This Cd is a great sample of songs. The wind cries mary and other popular songs are awesome. It gives you a great idea of what a Buffett concert is like. At the same time, the quality of sound is not the best. Still if you collect Buffett CD's this is a must."
4,Great follow up to 'Resist',"Kosheen have returned with a great follow up to 'Resist' which featured the hits 'hide u', 'catch', & 'hungry'...'Kokopelli' features less drum'n'bass beats and focuses more on mid-tempo guitar pop songs and the results are quite impressive...lead single 'all in my head' is a catchy love song with a great hook & superb vocals by Sian...other highlights inlucde 'coming home' which is my personal favourite with its 'i'm coming home now baby' chorus not leaving my brain since i first heard the track...'avalanche' , 'little boy' & 'ages' are also standout songs and there really isnt a bad track on the cd...fans of 'hide u' and the heavy drum'n'bass tracks featured on the last cd may be disappointed as the volume on this album is turned down a bit, however this is a great effort by the band - showing much growth and musical maturity...a cool mellow cd to chill out to. 4 stars out of 5."
2,another book wimps out on the letter X,"With the format of this book there would have been plenty of wonderful ways to present the letter X. Instead the book uses the phrase ""extra X's"". This does not help with reading and letter comprehension because every other letter had a page devoted to it with a 2 word phrase using the same letter for each word to present the letter featured on the page. When this pattern is broken for the letter X page only it is confusing to young children's learning"
4,"Controversial, but making a piont","This single comes from the album ""Bad Girl"" the album only has a spawn on 3 good hits, including this single. The song ""Sexual Feeling"" maybe discusting to some people, but others find it truthfull and can relate it to songs to this day. Also this is the only track on the album, ""bad girl"" that doesn't sound like the 80's. I recommend this work. Preview the song on {URL], but buy it on amazon for the best buy."
1,horrible remix of an album song,The remix of this song is only consisting of moaning and groaning. One wonders why La Toya did this ... probably because her then-management wanted to put her more into this kind of Playboy-image. I'm sure she regrets this song today
3,I Love The Lifestyle...,"One of the better records of 2001, was this, American indie-rockers Silkworm's latest release. 'Lifestyle' features twelve tracks, including a cover of 'Ooh La La' by The Faces. These twelve tracks have a continuous flow, with a indie rock meets garage meets country feel, sort of like what would happen if the principal members of Sebadoh, Pavement and Crazy Horse were to collaborate. The record has been produced by Steve Albini, and his touch creates a sense of lowend and clarity that further improve 'Lifestyle's charms. In particular, 'Treat The New Guy Right', 'The Bones' and 'Yr Web' are fantastic tunes that deserve to be heard by a wide audience. 'Lifestyle', while not a radical diversion from Silkworm's back catalogue, is interesting and creative enough to still be fresh after being given many listens that an album of this calibre deserves."
2,Disappointed.,"Where to begin, by buying a dog mail order? by not reading up on this breed? training ends up in a back yard pen aka prison. Please, look at what your shelters have to offer first, don't promote breeders you haven't met, nor the horror of puppy mills. The people represented in this family fill up shelters because they expect to much from dogs & children aren't trainers. Donna in New Mexico"
4,Perfect wallet,This one should outlive me for all those important papers. Would have preferred slots but didnt have them. I like the color and the material very much.
1,Stay Away!,"This is a horrible, horrible AV selector. Let me tick off the cons:-poor remote distance-sloppy signal to the tv (distortion and interference artifacts)-the color of the plastic doesn't match the plastic of the xbox-the xbox's rubber ""feet"" don't touch the selector, so the xbox sits on it's bottom surface, making the whole thing drone like crazy.-the storage shelves are awkwardly arranged and it's hard getting games out of the cheap sleeves.-generally cheap constructionnow the pros:-the green backlit buttons match the ring of light on the xboxDon't end up like me; with a crappy AV selector in the back of a closet. It's so bad I would feel bad selling it on ebay to some unsuspecting gamer."
5,MICHAEL AND MUSIC WHAT A GIFT!!,"I WAS SO DELIGHTFULLY SURPRISED AND HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM. BUT MICHAEL NEVER DISAPPOINTS ME. HIS YOUNG SWEET VOICE IS A JOY TO LISTEN TO. I LOVE HIS SONG ""MUSIC AND ME"" IT SEEM SO APPROPO SINCE HIS WHOLE PERSONA IS ALL ABOUT MUSIC AND EXPRESSINGIT SO BEAUTIFULLY."
5,solid black metal album,"This is a solid black metal album. It is somewhat reminiscent of old Dissection mixed with Old Man's Child and a bit of Slayer. The recording quality is a tad muddy, but not bad. Imagine shaving off a bit of the clarity of Dissection: Storm of the Light's Bane and that's how the sound quality sounds.The music on this album produces some excellent dark, evil atmosphere. If you are a fan of old Dissection, Slayer, Enslaved, Emperor, Old Man's Child, and perhaps even Dimmu Borgir, it is well worth your money."
3,Cleaning with Oxalic Acid,"Here is a little secret about Oxalic Acid. Oxalic acid is a weak acid as acids go. Diluted you can do a lot of things with it.One table spoon in a large bucket of water makes a great deck and porch cleaner to clean off moss and mold. Rinse off with clean water.One teaspoon in a bathroom toilet water tank cleans out hard water deposits ( like manganese) and algae.Also in a dishwasher with brown mineral deposits use 1 teaspoon in an empty dishwasher run the full cycle then another full cycle empty to clean with fresh water.This jar last me 7 to 10 years.If you don't believe me do a Google search ""Cleaning with Oxalic Acid""[...]"
4,Three Stooges Movie,"Having learned about the Stooges from watching them after school with the father, I do believe I've seen all the shorts more than once. I did not know what to expect from the video. I thought they did a good job of using many of the famous lines and placing them in the modern context. The bell scene and the ""do-nut"" remover had me laughing for 5 minutes at least. If your a Stooge fan, this is an enjoyable way to reminisce about them with something new."
1,Not as advertised,"The CD we received did not have all tracks listed on the ad/site. This was for my wife's birthday & all I could afford. Thanks for nothing, the track missing was why she wanted the album."
4,"Acoustic,Celtic,Poetic","Bittersweet poetry and haunting tunes make The Acoustic Motorbike a worthy addition to any music collection. The sound will stay with you long after a listen and the occasionally silly song, like the title track, makes a welcome change from the sense of pain that pervades the music. Even a cover of ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" sounds as if the singer knows that this will be a big mistake."
5,Luka Bloom at his finest,"Would highly recommend,A great blend of lyrics and music this material is not dated."
1,Editorials not Science,"This is a deeply flawed and disappointing collection of polemics revealing the editor's ""watermelon"" politics, (green on the outside, red in the middle)."
5,Couldn't be better,It was exactly what I hoped for. Fit in the corner perfectly and it adds a real nice touch to the room.I use the top shelf part for pictures and other display items.I would recommend for anyone looking for a nice cabinet that adds a little more to their wine collection.
2,"Drawer runner 1/4"" off, looks OK","So let me state that this looks fine in finished condition, though the back and wine bottle slats are definitely lower quality particle board. The wine slats don't sit tight and thus can move slightly around.The left drawer runner was a 1/4"" off, which may not sound bad but that meant the drawer did NOT fit after I put everything together and tried to slide it in. The runner is also particle board so very delicate. I had to take a nice chisel and gently detach it and drop it a 1/4"" inch, there are three brad nails in it, so it was firmly attached. Then I had to shoot three new brads in there.Luckily I had these tools, most people would not. Makes me wish I'd paid $40 less."
3,Good cabinet with some flaws,"It was exactly what I was looking for and with a good price. However, this walnut color has a subtle red to it, it came with minor defects on the painting and ( the biggest problem for me) does not fit tall glasses. My fancy wine and champagne glasses don't fit in it, just the water and a shorter style ones, they must be shorter than 22cm(8.5in).My husband said that it was easy to assemble.Overall I am happy with it, but it's not perfect."
3,Finished product looks great in spite of poor quality components,"While I have received many compliments on the finished product, there were some significant issues that one should be aware of before purchasing:1) My kit was missing the lower back panel. This happens from time to time, but I expected a replacement part to be shipped immediately. 2 weeks later after having the unit sitting half assembled I received the part.2) The replacement panel was too fat to fit in the grooves. Rather than send it back and risk another 2 weeks, I proceeded to whittle and sand it down until it fit.Three stars because the price was right and it looks great, but be aware assembly could take longer than it should."
1,Do not order,"First top was damaged in three places in manufacturing. Winsome was very responsive in providing a replacement. Unfortunately,the replacement top had a large semicircular gouge in the side. As. It was covered in stain, it had to be done during manufacture. Obvious that there is no product quality control. Now have question about ordering other Winsome products."
2,"Looks Nice, Horrible Quality","I recently purchased this wine cabinet and am less than happy with it. As another reviewer mentioned, the cabinet is incredibly shaky (not necessarily the quality you'd hope for in a piece of furniture holding glass wine bottles and glasses) and, after assembling it, I noticed a huge crack along the top of the unit. I contacted the company and didn't even receive as much as a reply. Thankfully, Amazon was kind enough to offer me a partial refund, but I can't say I'll be buying anything more from Winsome."
2,craftmanship,This cabinet was not well made and when put together felt shakey. Too heavy of a box to return. Would not recommend this product.
3,Winsome Wood Wine Cabinet,Nice cabinet. Nice price. Hard to put together. The back panel was too thick to fit into the grooves it was supposed to go into. I had to sand the edges of the piece in order to make it fit in.
3,Tough to assemble,"Availability was delayed several weeks and it arrived broken but I decided to glue it instead of returning. I typically enjoy putting things together but this was an exception, instructions weren't clear and I ended up having to disassemble to reinsert dividers properly but the worst problem was trying to get to all the screws or bolts with the little tool provided and I was unable to tighten sufficiently to eliminate wobble. However, once wine bottles in place it became sturdier. It is quite heavy and is a very practical and useful piece for storing wine and glasses and the Amazon price beat everyone. We have enjoyed it since assembly but be prepared for a challenge."
1,Don't purchase,"The product came damaged, there was a large scratch in the top and the back panel had a large crease. There are 2 slats that hold the wine glasses that were put in backwards. The cabinet is wobbly despite everything being tightened. I would not recommend this product! It has some of the worst craftsmenship I have seen."
3,I was disappointed in his approach.,"Of course nutrition is most important and I absorbed a lot of the information about vitamins and minerals needed. He went into so many side issues on womens' health (such as Toxemia during pregnancy) rather than being specific to osteoporosis, which is my main concern right now. I have osteoporosis and am not thinking about getting pregnant at this age. I thought he'd be more direct about exercise and advice along those lines. Doctors speak immediately about Fosamax and I wanted his opinion on that. When the book ended, I felt unsatisified."
3,A few hints about osteoprosis,"I've been having increasing bone loss for the past 20 years. I've followed everything that doctors and natural experts have told me to do, and still continue to loss the battle. If you are like me, please think beyond the typical calcium building diet and calcium supplements and weight-bearing exercise. I'm hoping that I've found the right doctor (specialized in Internal Med, plus Chinese medicine and naturopathy.) What no one realized was a need for my body to have a combination of bone-building supplements, diet, exercise and the right hormones. I'm hoping that my next bone density test will reveal a positive reward this time. Don't give up, keep searching for the method that will give you renewed bone growth and strength."
5,Great Product! A+++++++,I purchased this exact brand gasket for $2.26 at my local auto parts store. It fits my 1987 Vanagon to the tee and has stopped an annoying oil leak from my drain plug. Shop around and you can save $$$$.
1,I HATE IT!,"I'm sure the tricks in this book are good, but they are too long and its very hard to understand them. Every time I try doing one of them it never works or its to long and confusing to learn and I get very frustrated. I would recomend getting a different card trick book instead because you'll just get pissed trying to learn the tricks in ""Card Tricks Galore."""
1,Illegal Copy,This is an illegal copy of the Picture. I Can Make It Myself Productions is the copyright holder of the Picture and neither Pathfinder Films nor director Eric Koyanagi are licensed to sell this motion picture in any media now known or hereafter devised.
1,"Stated dimensions, 3.2 x 1.2 x 6 inches, are in error!",Actual dimensions are 3-3/16 x 3/4 x 3-3/16 inches. They would hold precious meager amounts of condiments. They are more the size used to hold a cute piece of milled soap in a guest bathroom. Their stated volume measurement is 4 oz. (from the package label).
1,Not what I ordered,"It took longer than usual to get my item. The vendor Aubuchon Hardware sent me the wrong grass hog. I specifically chose the single line model depicted in the picture because the dual line grass hogs get hopelessly tangled. Now I have to go through all the trouble of contacting the vendor and try to get my money back. I don't know if I have to pay another round of shipping charges to send it back. If Aubuchon Hardware wants to me to literally pay for their mistake, I'm just going to throw the whole box in the trash and avoid the vendor in the future."
2,This hog bites,"The grass hog feeds out too much line and snaps your leg with it, very painful. Both my wife and I have both been bit. You better wear jeans when using the hog."
2,Broke after 1 year,"Worked so so for 1 1/2 years...then it broken when the cap suddenly popped out and the whole string came entangled with the motor as it was running....So it broke the clip.Its too expensive for being a $55 trimmer, go to Home Depot and buy the $40 Homelite one. Works much better, faster, more powerful and much quieter..."
3,Redesign flaw,"This has been a truly excellent product in the past--I've had 3 others. New handle design, however is both inconvenient and dangerous as it flies apart during use. Redesign on plugin means the cord also doesn't stay attached. This one is a real disappointment--bought it relying on past experience. I sincerely wish manufacturers would learn to leave a good thing alone instead of ruining a piece of superior equipment."
4,Black & Decker Grass Hog,"The Grass Hog, is just right size for me....Ive been using a heavy gas 'weedeater'brand which was a pain...This electric grass hog is so sweet just plug in and go !!!"
2,AFS Does Not Work Consistently,Uses a lot of string. The automatic string feed system does not advance string consistently. I frequently have to stop trimming and disassemble the spool to advance the string manually. I must note that I have been reloading my own spools because the preloaded replacement spools are expensive. Would not buy again. In fact haven't found a good entry-level electric string trimmer yet after having the Weed Eater and this Black and Decker model.
2,Losing Faith in Black and Decker,"Black and Decker products used to be a favorite of mine - relatively inexpensive, generally got the job done and were reliable. I previously had a rechargeable trimmer from B&D which was fairly reliable, but the automatic feed spool didn't work very well. The same problem carries over to this model. I had to return the first one of these I purchased, because the AFS was broken right out of the box. The replacement lasted only about two months - it no longer feeds automatically. I think I'll be trying another brand next."
1,Don't buy!,"I have owned two other Grass Hogs. I like them because they are lightweight and take care of my trimming needs. When it was time to buy a new one I thought I would try the refurbished model since it was exactly like my previous trimmer. First, the trimmer I received is not the same as depicted in the main picture. The trimmer never worked right out of the box, there is no tension to keep the line from wrapping around the interior (spindle?). I don't think they tested this before they threw it in the box along with the wrong manual! Wish I had bought a new model, now I am out return shipping cost."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,Placed my order on-line one day and received it in the mail 4 days later. The delivery was fast but VERY DISAPPOINTED when I open the box. The Black and Decker trimmer did not look anything like the picture in the box. Perhaps that is a little over stating it. The handle was totally different. So I sent it back to where it came from.
1,Total Piece Of Garbage,"I bought this at Lowes, not here at Amazon. It lasted just two uses before the motor smoked and burned out. Returned it for a full refund. I haven't had good luck with anything from Black and Decker's new line of products and will never buy anything made by them again. Total garbage from their small kitchen appliances and cordless tools to their yard equipment. They used to be a reputable company back in the day but their new line of products are unreliable and very cheaply made."
4,"Powerful, with easy handling, but..","Much more powerful than the battery powered model, but the string isn't up to the job as it frequently breaks. Also while using it the plug loosened causing an electrical arc which melted some of the plastic. My repair was to open the handle and wire in a male electric plug with a couple of feet of cord hanging out. This allowed me to secure that cord firmly to the handle which solved the problem. The unit should be designed with the plug on a cord and not fixed to the handle. An otherwise excellent unit.12-11-2012 Bought some thicker line for it to rewind on the spool with the hope that the new line will hold up better. Will let you know in the Spring how it works out."
1,Downhill slide for B & D,"I had the older version of the Black and Decker Grass hog which served me well for over 15 years and was easy to reload. The motor finally gave out and I replaced it with what I thought was a similar but new and improved model. Huge mistake. This thing worked fine for most of the first reel, but cannot get it to feed correctly after that, whether I buy their over-priced ""factory-wound"" reels or load it myself. I have spent far more time changing or fixing the reel than actually using the product. Do these engineers ever actually use these products before they send them to market? B & D used to mean quality but they have clearly given that up as a corporate value."
2,Two Years Then Died.,"Well, I used this for two years and it was satisfactory. I have a small lawn, maybe twenty by forty feet and the Grass Hog did a decent job. The string advanced fine, and cut low. But I used it only in the Spring and Summer months and the lawn is not particularly hardy. Well, yesterday I take it out and about half way through the cut the trimmer starts to SMOKE. White plumes of it. Then it begins to sputter and jerk. Then it died. Now it's garbage. Two years? Warranty expired. Is that all there is? Don't think I'll be buying another soon. I want one that lasts longer."
4,Works for me,"Wow. I don't know if I was just lucky, but my Grasshog works fine, and the ASF works fine. It is a bit noisy, but...it's a WEEDWHACKER. Whaddaya expect? I really don't have any complaints; it's been working well for almost two years."
1,Stay away,"Black & Decker GH600 Grass Hog 14-Inch 5-AMP Electric String Trimmer and EdgerThe string does not auto feed. Wasted more time in feeding the string manually than weed wacking. Don't drop the spool while manually feeding the string, you'll waste even more time in re-threading the string back to the spool. Totally disappointed at this BD product. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
1,Worked great -- then died,Worked well until smoke starting pouring out of it. There's a reason they put vents in the shaft! After the smoke stopped it was dead and never worked again.
3,At least it is inexpensive...,"I bought one 4.5 years ago and with sporadic use died today. Not sure if I want to get another. Let me confirm what you will read elsewhere it eats line like it wasn't paying for it (buy the three packs). The first three years it worked well enough. The sound isn't so bad, but quieter than gas ones. In a pinch, you can even trim small bushes under an eighth inch in an ugly unsafe way. I used it to clear around their base. I also agree with another review this is a small yard edger on larger one it may get warm.It has a tendency as it got older to heat the line causing it to stick to itself ont he spool and require manually pulling the line out somewhat frequently. Today the white plastic clutch lock in the spinning head broke so it won't stop feeding line. I'll edit my review once I find out how much it costs to replace the $.25 plastic part."
2,String Hog!,"I bought this a while back, but didn't use until now. Big mistake. I used it and the string ran out after about 15 minutes of cutting. Very annonying but thought it must have come with a starter amount of string like they do with the starter ink for computer printers.Bought a new 30 ft spool for $6. You can get string yourself and wind it yourself for about half that much. Put the new spool on and after about 50-60 ft of trimming and edging I was out of string!Do the math: 1 Ft of string for evert 1.5-2 feet you edge/trim!I would take it back but it's been too long."
4,"So far pretty good, my first Trimmer / Edger, Cheap Parts","No point repeating what others have said, so including that,The handle that is mid-way down the trimmer is made of plastic and will probably break if I tighten it again (it keeps coming loose). It does the job of trimming really good and I haven't used it yet for weed-whacking! :)"
4,perfect,"This machine is ideal for my needs. Easy to use/easy to replace line.I have a 1/4 acre yard and use mine weekly for trimming and edging around chain link fencing, gardens,driveway etc...I use a new spool about once per month. My only complaint is that the guard could be a little more efficient. I get hit pretty frequently with flying debris.(Just wear long sleeves and pants while using)"
1,JUNK! DO NOT BUY!,For every 5 minutes you get weeding you'll spend 20 minutes of misery. I finally took an axe to this piece of junk and won't touch anything with the name Black and Decker ever again.
1,Worst String Trimmer Ever!!!,"I had my previous B&D trimmer for about 10 years (bump feed) before the motor finally gave out - it was a solid lawn tool. I had high hopes for this new automatic feed model. What an infuriating piece of garbage - I have the same problem as everyone else. The string refuses to automatically release and you have to open the access lid to the head and let out new line - about every 10 feet. Yah - what fun!!! I was a loyal B&D fan, but I'm a free agent now. DO NOT BUY THIS ENGINEERING CATASTROPHE, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!"
2,Couldn't wait to destroy it!,Price is good. Cutting is good. Edging is good. But the auto feed mechanism forced me to refill the spool after edging one side of a 30 ft driveway - almost every time! It was extremely frustrating and the amount of line it ate was ridiculous. Now shopping for a replacement after less than 10 uses and throwing it in the trash.
4,Grass Hog Feedback,"This electric weedeater has good power, but the factory installed monofilament breaks very often. Using a heavier duty cures this problem, but it is not recommended by the manufacturer. I went from the delivered 1.65mm (0.65 inch) to 2.00mm and it really made a difference in performance. Hope this helps."
1,Worst Product I have Purchased,"The line feed absolutely does not work. I have tried different .065 lines and none will feed out. The worst condition is when the trimmer is rotated for curb/sidewalk trimming. I cannot get past ten feet without a line break, followed by no out-feed. Although I have a relative small area for trimming the process using this product takes at least ten (10) times longer than it should."
2,Big problem with the trimmer line,The trimmer works very well but it eats line like mad. I used a whole spool doing my front yard and didn't even touch the back. I bought a roll of .065 replacement line and tried to wind my own. It did NOT work. It requires ROUND line that is difficult to find. B&D does sell replacement spools at $5 ea. Eight more lawn-trimming sessions would pay for another trimmer. I'd be better off throwing this trimmer away and buying a bump-style trimmer.
1,Just to reiterate what others have said,This would be a great trimmer if it didn't have the string feed problems. I only managed to cut about 1' along the edge of my lawn with this before the string cut off but failed to advance new string. I had to get my husband to help me manually advance the string and another 1' later it did the same thing. This is using the original spool! I've abandoned string trimmers and will be using electric shears to cut the edge of my lawn.
1,Great String Trimmer-After 2 yrs AWFUL!!!,"I've used this trimmer twice now since receiving it and it works wonderfully! It's very easy to operate and is powerful. I think that the reason some owners complain about excessive string usage is perhaps they are not using the fold down wire edge guard. This guard keeps the trimmer at the correct height and keeps string usage to a minimum. So far, I'm very happy with it especially that one does not have to ""bump"" to feed the line out.3-26-10. After using this product for 2 yrs, it has stopped feeding the line out, so I'm recommending that everyone stay away from this trimmer! It's simply NOT reliable. Initially, it was great but as fate would have it, it's not worth the money!"
2,So-so trimmer,This trimmer has a few issues. It's auto-feed feature is hit or miss. The wire guide for edging is poorly designed. It flips out of position too easy and will pop out completely. Mine popped out and I'm still searching my yard for it. The trimmer does seem powerful enough. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a better trimmer.
1,efrhjbjy,"Quit on me but was using it in heavy growth. replaced it w/ store bought one, it quit, had store replace. kid did something to the replacement one & so far so good."
4,Grass Hog,"It's does the job well. It could be longer for users over 5'- 9"" . The edge trimmer part is a little difficult to use."
4,"Decent Product, Wrong Description","The item is advertised as a GH600 and the photo accurately depicts the GH600. However, the item I received was the GH610 which is different in appearance and after researching, appears to have similar specs and is the newer version of the GH600. I tried it out and it feels similar to using the GH600 and worked fine for the minute I tested it. Hopefully, it will last 11 years like my old GH600 did."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I have this for a couple years. Hardly used it, but disappointed every time I used. Not for a heavy use. The string does not feed well. All the sudden, no string came out at all. I would pay more for a better one. I'm not even a yard person and I know this is not a good product."
2,Good for 2 months,The self feed option quit working after 2 months. I have used it for another year by advancing the string by hand each painful time. I use the correct refills acording to my local home store that sold me this thing. You get what you pay for.
1,piece of junk,I bought this at walmart to supplement my cordless trimmer as I thought it would be stronger for thorough weed-eating. To my surprise after a small amount of using it it started smoking. I have a very small yard and i can't even do part of it without this trimmer failing. I have only tried to use it twice and it is a piece of garbage like most of Black and Decker products!
1,Worst Product Ever,I've officially banned all Black and Decker products forever. I used the Grasshog dual spool corded weed eater and it went through 4 spools in about 1 hour and then completely ate two more before I litterally destroyed it. Yes I read all the instructions and I'm pretty mechanically savvy. No one should ever buy any Black and Decker product much less their weed eaters.
4,Electric Trimmer and Edger,"I like this electric trimmer a lot more than any gas trimmer, but at the end of the day I would rather have a battery operated trimmer. You don't need to mess with gas or a pull cord, but this is still a good trimmer.Pros-Easy to use-Don't need gas-No pull cord-Cuts goodCons-Extension Cord-Goes threw a lot of string-A lot of start and go"
4,JAGMAN,"Well worth the money. Very durable and powerful on thick weeds, high grass and edging. Got tired of dealing with gas trimmers so I gave this one a chance and I am not disappointed. Only reason I gave it a 4-star rating is due to the amount of string you will go through, but re-spooling is easy. Recommend you purchase the extra spool pack - I go through at least 1.5 spools doing an average amount of whacking/trimming each time."
2,Not as Advertised,WARNING - you get a double string trimmer NOT the single that is avertised here. Was disappointed in that since I have A LOT of replacement trimmer line heads for my old since line unit. These are great machines and do a great job edging. Only problem is that I find that I get 2 years out of them before they stop feeding the line and it becomes a problem. I LOVE them when they are working but it sucks when they stop :(!
1,Utter Garbage,"Zero stars. The so-called ""Automatic Feed System"" should be called the ""Tangles in 5 minutes system."" I've gone through three spools. The first ran out one side the line in minutes, leaving the other half of the spool still wound. They ""Recommend"" against rewinding yourself for good reason. It's impossible.I went back to Menard's, got a second spool. This one tangled into a birds' nest in 5 minutes.I got a third. This one lasted perhaps 10 minutes, then fed against itself and tangled up.American business management and Chinese craftsmanship. What could possibly go wrong?B&D; needs to stop being clever and stick to what works."
2,Works great--for awhile,"I bought this from a local hardware store and it worked great for about 3 months, then the rotor stopped spinning. I just brought it back and swapped it out for a new one. This one has lasted a year, and had the same problem--motor running but the rotor was not spinning. I opened it up to find that the belt had broken and looked very frayed (there were small rubber pieces strewn throughout the motor area.I won't buy another, and am very disappointed with B&D; and won't buy another hog. I had a Toro before these that lasted 6 years and worked fine. Don't know what I'll get next."
4,Very happy with the way it works.,"Happy with the trimmer, weed eater. The only thing that would make it better would be if I could it in my chair and do it with a remote control! But they haven't invented those yet."
1,Don't count on it to feed string,"I recently bought this model after my previous B&D trimmer gave up the ghost. Although the previous model had occasionally failed to feed string automatically, by and large, it had worked quite well. Not so with the new model. Two strings mean less capacity and THEY DO NOT FEED. Not automatically, not reliably, mostly not at all. Check out the reviews anywhere else for ANY of the current auto feed models, they just don't work. You have no recourse but to open up the spool and feed it out by hand every time it gets too short to use. I went with the only 'bump' model left on the market and CR's second top choice. (They got it way wrong with the B&D.) Save time, try another brand, this one is not worth the money. How the mighty have fallen; it's really sad."
2,Stick with the standard,"I found this to be dangerous (the string gets whacked off and goes flying) and my legs and ankles were injured from this many times and I never had that problem with any other trimmer. It's also difficult to load the string and it goes through a lot of it. Although I've only used mine for 1 season, I am buying a regular weed eater today as I just don't wish to be bothered with this one. It does do a great job of cutting. Just not well designed."
2,"Powerful, but line feeder stinks","Cons:1. Line feed does not work w/ replacement string.2. Have to buy new spool to get line feed to work.3. Use line very quickly, probably due to how powerful it is.Pros:1. Powerful2. Great at edging3. Light Weight"
4,This Grass Hog is worth every dime,"I am a long time B & D consumer from yard care products to household items. I needed a new trimmer without having to spend a fortune in the process, and came across this little gem.As the name implies, it eats up(or more aptly through) some of the thickest spikes of grass, to the weeds that are common trouble makers in one's landscape. The two-in-one on board edger works quickly and efficently and gives a great manicured look. If the electric trimmer is more your speed, like me, trust me it is worth purchase price. Way to go, B&D;!"
3,decent,I go through 1 spool each month. To me thats too quick. My property is only 0.5 acre. This trimmer might be better suited for smaller properties. Note however that I do alot of trimming and EDGING. Maybe 1 month is typical then.
2,Incorrect Item Pictured,"I owned the string trimmer pictured. After six seasons the trimmer wore out so I went to replace it based on the image. Unfortunately the GH600 I received is a CHEAPER quality plastic, no soft grips as shown and no lever lock to prevent cord disconnection. The shaft is also a silver color. The first time I used it, the auto feed stopped working and the cord disconnected several times. I've written to Amazon about the incorrect product image but the site was never updated.This item is another example of a company placing what used to be a good brand on an inferior product."
5,Excellent trimmer,I have been using this trimmer for three years in keeping the tall grass on extremly rocking land cut short. Not just on a 1/2 acre but on 5 acres! I have never had a problem with it and I beat it up pretty good! It still works great too.
1,$8 per use,"This thing goes through a spool every time I use it. I ended up throwing it in the trash. The auto feed doesn't know when to quit. As it gets near the end it starts spewing out too much and ends up shooting the remaining string out at high velocity. Useless, and dangerous."
2,black and decker review,"The black and decker grass hog has no potential in cutting grass or weeds. It iselectric so, no as much horse power in its intended job.Plus it wastes wire like non other. In my opion it is not product recomemeded."
3,Easy to assemble,"Although it says electric in the description, I thought it would be charged and then used in the yard. This product requires an extension cord. Works great, but I wish I'd bought something that could be charged and then used without being tied to a cord."
4,Enjoyable,I bought this at Lowe's and enjoy it on my 1/2 acre. I never had one before but knew I didn't want a gas trimmer for noise and having to yank on a string like a mower. I find the noise level acceptable. True I keep at least one roll of string on hand since I use this to clean out the open ditch in front of my house. But so easy to replace (just pop out the old and in with the new) I can't complain. And long pants are a MUST. One stinging gash will speak volumes to you.
5,I would definitely recommend this,"I have a small lot (8500 sq. ft.) and the rear portion had a fair amount of tall grass growing in a non-landscaped area. This thing chopped that stuff down no problem. I had a McCullough gas trimmer that couldn't take that stuff down.I haven't had it long enough to comment on the line use issues, but i think for ~$50 this is a great value. It does a lot better edging my bermuda lawn than the dedicated Craftsman edger that I had (used a blade).So basically this outperforms 2 units that had a combined cost of around $200 for me. So far I am thrilled with it. Don't worry about it not having the power to do basic trimming. This has converted me to electric trimmers for the foreseeable future."
3,String Hog by Black & Decker,"The electric grass hog by B&D is a good price and works very well. The problem is the automatic string feed. Each use will use the entire spool and at [$$]...for a 3 pack of string is very expensive. I bought the unit...and when the other two spools are used, I am taking it back for a refund! B&D makes great products, but they need to rethink the string usage. Make tuffer string."
1,Not a good value,I've had two B&D trimmers. Both broke after about a year of relatively light use. I figured after the first one broke that I just had bad luck but I've now learned my lession.The automatic feed mechanism feeds the line far too fast. String is cheap (as long as you don't buy B&D's refills) but it is a bother to constantly stop cutting in order to put more string in.I wonder if B&D was trying to take the ink jet approach with this product: sell the product for relatively cheap and then sell the refills at a premium price.
2,Trimmer knife breaks.,"I've had the trimmer knife break off twice. The trimmer knife is used to automatically cut the string to the desired length. Without the knife, the trimmer cannot be used. The first time the knife broke off Home Depot reluctantly accepted the exchange. The second time I riveted a sheet of sharpened metal to where the knife used to be. I'm looking around for a better model. This model eats line like crazy, particularly the non-round kind, leaving pieces of trimmer line everywhere. On the plus side, it is light and easily adjusted."
1,junk,"I purchased one of these from the local Home Depot, it went through the courtesy reel within the first hour, just long enough to trim and edge the front yard.the reel cover was extremely difficult to remove, once the dual reel was in and the wrestling match to reinstall the reel cover was over the trimmer proceeded to disgorge itself of the string within the first five feet or so, what didn't attempt to weld itself to the housing, spilled all over my back yard.This ""trimmer"" has found a new home at the local landfill, and is the last Black and Decker product that I will ever purchase"
2,Not Bad but NOT Good Either,"I am on my third Grass Hog and you'd think I am a real fan. I have number 3 only beause numbers 1 and 2 died soon after buying each. This one has not stopped working just some features like the bump thingy. I will throw this device away as soon as I either get another trimmer or this one dies dead. It, honestly, takes me twice as long to trim the yard by having to stop, undo the string holder, pull some string out, replace the holder and go at it. If the bump worked this would be a 4 rated machine. It can make it to 5 if someone at B&D comes up with a way to make a shaft long enough for folks over 5'7"" tall. If you are 6'3"" I will almost guarantee a sore back from leaning over while trimming."
2,When it works its great,"When this works its like the Tony Hawk of weed eaters but I had a problem with the motor belt constantly slipping off. This means taking it apart (8-10 screws) and slipping it back on just to have it slip off again an hour later. Support was wonderful and when I got the new belt it did the same thing an hour later. Engineering needs to use capped gears and when I find a suitable work-around I will be using it again. Too bad one minor glitch sidelines a really great tool. Oh yeah, wear protective shoes, this thing throws lots of flesh tearing line at random."
1,Broke the first time I used it!,"We followed the instructions and put it together... I started weed eating and about 1 hour into the work, it completely stopped working. we followed all the troubleshooting tips, but to no avail. It was a piece of junk. Black and Decker is not the quality it used to be..."
1,What a piece of Crap!,"I have given up on this useless piece of crap. It worked just fine until the 5 ft of sting ran out on the trimmer and it came time to replace the spool. I bought the replacement spool thinking that it would be a simple install as in other trimmers that I have used, but no such luck. There were no instructions that came with the packaging of the refills and so I consulted the owners manual and it might as well as have been in Greek because it was completely irrelevant to what I needed to do. Searches around the internet provide me with no information on how to do it either. In the end, I am going to just have to pull the weeds by hand. This is the third trimmer that I have tried from Black & Decker and since the first two broke and this one is useless...never again!"
4,Great for the pre-school set!,"I paid around $5 for this kit at Meijer. The kit is simple to use. I used an awl to punch the pre-provided pattern. Then our 3 and 4 year old sons inserted the pegs and pounded them in. The light requires a 9 volt battery. At first I thought it was malfunctioning till I realized it was intentionally flashing. My guess is that it stays lit for a half second and is dark for 3 seconds. I found it more satisfying just to stick a constant light inside so you could admire the pattern, but the boys were thrilled to watch it flash. Inserting the pegs allowed them to feel like they were a part of the process instead of simply watching me try to carve. I appreciated the fact that I suffered no knife injuries while using this product. I'd love to find these on sale and pass them along to friends with young children."
2,It's very bad,"The MC bothers me. In addition, the most of singers were not original and they sang awful. Don't buy this CD, but the original one."
4,It glows with peace....and romance!,"Jim Brickman did not shortchange his rabid fans with this sultry release, giving us no less than 37 songs. Of course, many of these sentimental piano tunes are very short, but nonetheless, Brickman delivers the goods - as usual!!I can't help but think that Brickman would fit in beautifully with some band within the metal genre, a band looking to ""soften"" their image and sound. Jim, get your resume out there!In the meantime, simply enjoy the relaxing and easy tunes that this legend creates on what seems like a bi-yearly basis.Seek the truth in piano - Brickman's piano!!"
5,MY ROMANCE,Fabulous..This album touched every fiber of my being. Jim is truly one of the all time great artists. Please keep the good music coming
4,Great Overview of Jimi's Career,"The idea behind this box set was to take four similar concerts, one from each year he toured between '67 and '70. This gives the listener the opportunity to see how Jimi and the band changed the songs over the years. The set lists don't exactly match, but have a fair amount of overlap. The '69 and '70 shows are the best with jimi and the band playing great. The sound quality is good on all of the shows. I wouldn't recommend this as a first purchase for Jimi material, but for any fan it's worth having."
2,Does not do the job,"If pushed down or up hard enough, my double-hung windows pushed right over them. Use these on your second floor to reduce a crimminal's leverage, otherwise consider yourself robbed."
1,Not as advertised.,The cigars that came in this shipment were gold and pink. They were not the ones shown with the simulated tobacco leaf exterior.
4,"tame, but fun",1 blindfold and 2 silky ties. not too risque for those into light bedroom bondage. everything has a subtle smell of vanilla.
3,Great Album Filled With The Best Songs,"This Album is great, especially the song by Barbara Mason ""You Can Be With The One You Don't Love"" for that song I would alone give it 5 Stars (*****)! The songs are great on this album, if you are really into those hard to find oldies, the ones where they can take you back, or create new memories. Over all This album is great. Oh, One More thing! Too bad that song by Barbara Mason can only be found on this CD, it can also be found on ""The Very Best of Barbara Mason"" too bad that album is out of print, if it ever comes back in I strongly suggest that you get that album!!!"
4,Gym Posters,These are a little smaller than one would like for a gym wall. Other than that they are nice. Thay came laminated and ready to hang.
4,A review for the serious vergetarian,"Hello first of all I if you haven't already seen my star rating for this item, I've rated it 4 stars. And I meant every one of them. However this is just the opinion of one person (myself).When reading reviews something to consider is the fact that we all have different taste buds. While this product may taste great to me, it may taste like garbage to you. That being said here is my critical review of this product.1. Does not taste exactly like chicken, however it is a great chicken alternative that taste somewhat like chicken. It does taste good.2. The consistency is excellent. It's just the right thickness that you can easily cut with a fork.3. Flavor is good by itself, but for those of you who require a little bit more, I suggest using ""Seasoning Salt"" and some ""Black Pepper"" or whatever you prefer... Garlic maybe?4. Taste best with rice or noodles.There's my review. Please consider..."
4,Loma Linda Fried Chikn,"My family loves this vegetarian meat substitute. I ordered a case. The price was good. It was shipped promptly. The only downside was that 9 of the 12 cans were bent and/or crunched up - which most stores either discard or discount. For this reason, I will not re-order this item."
4,Mixed Review,"I like this product; I find it delicious. We eat it sliced into pieces and added to vegetarian dishes like stir fry. However, my husband doesn't much like it (he would give it two stars and I would give it five). We will be buying FriChik in the future, which he prefers--so that is an option if this one isn't your favorite."
2,Spam for vegetarians,"That's the only thing I could think of when eating this. The texture, the taste, the ""gravey"" that it comes in. It's just not that good. It's just not for me."
2,"No, it does not taste like chicken!","I bought a case of this vegan alternative to fried chicken, then tried cooking it in a variety of styles, methods, and venues--and always it came up short. That is to say it tastes NOTHING like chicken, fried or not. Each of the 5 pieces in a can resembles a flat drumstick, but that's where the similarity with real chicken ends. It tastes more like compressed dough dipped in a beefy gravy, more reminiscent of bland cat food than K.F.C. (not that I ever tried bland cat food). I would recommend passing up this entrée and look for something more palatable like...real vegetables!"
5,Thats odd ..,"I read this book thinking , yeah , thats just a complicated way of looking at what I do all the time ( and I thought I was being lazy , by rarely using Differential Diagnosis . ) ( I have a small veterinary clinic . )Started work this morning ( Tuesday ) with the annoying , but unshakeable conviction it was Wednesday .Eventually thought to track back for cues and realised it was my neighbours dustbin , further up the drive than usual . Dustbins are put in street , Wednesdays for collection . Found I was now totally convinced today was Tuesday .Started mentally running through the various tales from my past with which I repeatedly bore my aquaintances . Motive was to see if I could use any of my well aired stories , to illustrate stuff to my employees .Surprised to find , in stories that I had run through many times over the years , novel and better solutions to problems I'd dealt with , suddenly occuring to me .Wow ! I am impressed ."
3,a rocking follow up to Candleland,"to compare this cd to Candleland is kind of unfair, i think, because they both represent two different sides of Ian McCulloch's songwriting. while Candleland was more of a winter kind of album...Mysterio is a summer time record. big guitars and brash choruses with a street rock appeal. most of these songs are pretty good and some are great. ""Honeydrip"" and ""Damnation"" are the most fun songs on this album and showcase some of McCulloch's better lyric writing skills. also, worth mentioning is the keen cover design. i dig the argyle three-tone layout. very nice."
5,WONDERFUL-MUST HEAR!!!,"I recieved this CD as a gift on my 12th b-day 2 years ago, and I can't stop listening to it! My very favorites are ""The Whistle Stop Cafe"" and ""Smokey Lonesome"", particularly ""The Whistle Stop Cafe"". If you are thinking about buying the soundtrack, I highly suggest that you consider the score as well, because although you may not have noticed the 'background' music in the movie, it in truth may be the most beautiful music you have ever heard!!!"
4,great but did not receive Shade LE with my purchase,"Poser 6 is great.Being a beginner it would probably take me weeks (or more) to be able to model a 3d human (and then it still would look bad). But with Poser I can just use their models and morph them with its preset dials -- or I can add my own custom made morph targets.Plus Poser 6 can do a lot more...It deserves five stars in my opinion.Meanwhile Amazon did not also ship Shade LE in this ""Poser-ShadeLE Bundle"". However I don't believe Shade LE is worth my time to deal with, so I never followed up on the transaction. (It's probably a nice program if its cheap or free, though.)The price was good for Poser alone, but since Amazon screwed up, I'm subtracting a star from my rating."
2,If you are going to buy it don't buy direct from eFrontier...,"...buy it here and save $s!Shipping cost from the UK added $46.95 to the price AND a Foreign Debit Card Transaction fee of $2.51 for a waste of $49.46 that could have been spent getting additional models.Or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out, the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4. Practical Poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing Poser 6 development."
3,Poser 6 Review,"I got frustrated trying make humanoid figures in Blender, so i purchased Poser6. From the outset the default figures are very good. It didnt take me long to learn how to add hair, clothing and deform the figures. But thats as far as i got. There are so many variables that affect the final render, such as lighting, skin textures, etc. This package is for experienced users. I have since sold my Poser package, as it was far too complex for what i expected."
2,Shade LE?,I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE.I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again.
4,Great buy for the money,"I own a restaurant and use these chillers for our white wines. We are an unpretentious place, but serve wines that sell for up to $125 a bottle. With that said, these chillers look great on the table and do justice to even the more expensive wines. The price is fantastic and the quality is pretty good.We have had a problem with the kitchen staff using the chillers for hot liquids at times and this results in cracking of the steel inside the chiller, so I would not recommend using these for anything but cold liquid or wine bottles. (Hot liquid is not what these are intended for, but in a restaurant, the staff will take certain liberties so just thought I would mention it)."
1,"Looks Cheap, Breaks Down","I'm not sure if it was just a one-time experience, but the first time it was used, the inside material started flaking off. It ends up leaving a bunch of aluminum shavings all over the wine bottle (not a big deal - but it makes the finish look really cheap). I'd go with something else before recommending this."
5,Superb CD!!!,"I originally bought this CD last year from a producer. I have loved this album since the first time I heard it. It was so weird, but cool to hear Nick's voice! It was weird, yet cool since he was so young at the time of the recording, and his voice hadn't changed yet. Nick's performance of ""Uptown Girl"" is really lively and upbeat. The other songs are just as terrific! Nick rocks!"
5,Must have for the Nick Carter/BSB Fan!,"If you collect Nick Carter/BSB items then this is a must have. A collection of demos and performances by Nick before he joined BSB. True, his voice back then wasn't quite up to the same raspy power that he has found in his career these days, but it's fun to listen to. He sounds of course a lot like the early days of Aaron. The collection is a mixed bag of songs you wouldn't expect the hard rock lover to sing. The most amusing of course is his cover of Billy Joel's 'Uptown Girl,' in which Nick sings the lyrics ""I bet she never had a backstreet guy."" It's a cute irony."
4,A BSB fan must-have!,"If you're a fan of Nick Carter or the Backstreet Boys, big or small, owning this album is a must! It's a compilation of all of Nick's demos from the years 1989-1993.I must admit, his voice resembles a slightly deeper tone of his younger brother, pop sensation, Aaron Carter. I was shocked by the album... the songs he performs don't do him justice- he sounds spectacular all through the album. It's an adorable flashback that's well worth the money."
3,Old Nick Carter,"Ok, I am a huge BSB fan. I bought Nick's ""Now or Never"" cd. It rocks. I heard this cd was out and thought I would buy it to see what early Nick sounds like. I was surprised because his voice has not changed as much as I thought it did. I have heard an early BSB song (""Tell Me That I'm Dreaming"") which was made when he first joined the group. So, his voice was pretty much still the same as it was on this cd. If you are a HUGE Nick Carter fan, this is a must have. If you just want to see what he sounded like when he was 13, you can pretty much listen to his little brother's (Aaron)first cd. There is not much of a difference."
1,wtf?,"As if the backstreet boys weren't bad enough, now we have this kind of cash-in dross. don't waste your money. donate it to charity, use it for grocery's, treat yourself to a meal out, avoid this nonsense."
1,Depressing At Best,"Though he was always the most popular member of the Backstreet Boys, Nick Carter was also the least talented in the voice department. I bought this because I hoped that maybe away from a five-voice setting, Nick would prove that he really deserved all the hype. This album in fact reinforces Nick's status as one of the worst sounding pop stars of all time. He may have a pretty face, but his whiny, off-key voice is exceedingly painful to listen too. I'll stick to my BSB albums when I'm feeling nostalgic from now on, thanks."
1,this is a joke,man this is hilarious save your money and buy his upcoming cd instead this is for backstreet fans who just got to know everyhting about certain members.
5,Recommended,This book is excellent. It arrived in great condition and in a timely fashion. I was very pleased
5,Anticon's Best,"It's hard to say one thing from anticon is the best work coming from the Frisco lable, but this easily is up there. As a colaboration it seperates itself from other individual albums (bottle of humans, cirlce, three phase irony- what not), but as it is a colaboration of four of the best mcs in anticon (dose, sole, alias and slug) plus cuts from jel, moodswing9 and dj mayo, this album is bound to be good. Basically every song on this good and most are excellent. my favorites include june 26th, scarecrow speaks, i am hip-hop, and especialy the last four ( slight, exist, purpose and mother of invention). A must have album for any hip hop enthuthiess (or something like that). if this manages to make you say ""nice one"" then go for bottle of humans, giga and other stuff"
4,good keypad,This is a decent keypad for the price. I am only giving 4 stars because I do not like that there is not a cover for the keypad. I live where we have cold winters and I wonder how the keypad will hold up. Otherwise it was easy to program and works great with my 20 year old opener.
5,Great product....,This works great. It's the second one i bought from here in a span of 2 weeks.I have 2 gates and they took seconds to program and minutes to install.
1,Works intermitently,Bought this product reading the reviews and since i have a multicode reciever on the gate at first it worked fine and then it wouldnt work until reprogrammed it every time got tired of it and eventually returned the product.. I think i am going to give it another try and see if i just received a bad piece or is the product actually crap..
4,Mounted Outside. No Problems,This worked like a charm. It was easy to program. I mounted it outside my garage and I've had it for about 1 year without any issues. I would buy it again.
1,Disappointed,"I received this product quickly from ASP doors. Unfortunately, that is the only positive feedback I can offer.I purchased a receiver and keypad that were defective. The assistance from Linear Corporation was less than adequate, and they were not able to address the problem. I could make the door actuate only when the transmitter was within 1"" of the receiver antenna. Ultimately, Linear told me that I had to go to ASP Door to return the product.It has been a month and multiple e-mails to ASP Doors - with absolutely no response. I will not consider purchasing any product from ASP Doors again. Be advised that if you do, and the product is defective, that there is no phone number for ASP Doors and that they do not answer e-mails."
2,2nd one no good either,Too hard to program. Didn't keep out the rain and it crashed. Why bother with another. I just supplied everyone with a visor remote.
3,Keypad sometimes sticks,"This is the keypad that works with my gate remote. When new, it works perfectly. After a time, since It is not weather protected, the dust and rain sometimes causes the keys to stick and you must rub them to get them unstuck. I have been using this keypad for 9 years, and need to buy a new one every 2-3 years."
3,It works....but...,"It has a couple problems. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have a waterproof cover. I've had to tape the battery cover to the unit because it didn't have a good fit. Rain could easily drip inside the battery compartment. Last of all, don't try using it until you've read and studied the programming instructions. The instructions that come with the remote are annoying at best. If you have trouble setting the time on a digital watch should have someone else program it for you. Oh...and don't forget to change the 1-2-3-4 default settings to your own personal codes if you really want real security."
2,Unhappy customer!!!,"I've purchased two of these keypads, after the first one wore out I decided to find another of the same brand, which I did at Amazon!! They are relatively easy to install...even for a woman...however, I would have liked numbered, step-by-step installation instructions, as I had to try the programming several times.NOW...ONE MONTH LATER.......THE PIECE OF JUNK HAS QUIT WORKING!! When I enter the code, the light lights up, but the door will not open. I'm too upset and disgusted to try anything further with it!!! So, after going without a keypad opener for several months, and being so excited to find one like I'd had.......here I am again without one!!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!"
1,Gives Tedium a Bad Name,"Keith Laumer has done some wonderful and imaginative books over the years, particularly his Retief series. The premise here is interesting, but the situations are ridiculous, repetitive, and boring. When O'Leary changes shape, there's a girlfriend for his new body, a jealous boyfriend, and a father ready to start the wedding. He changes shape again, and there's a new girlfriend, jealous boyfriend, father, etc. The writing for both situations is nearly identical. One of his temporary bodies belongs with a band of gypsies, and reading pages of dialog written in a cheesy French accent is guaranteed to give you a headache. O'Leary is supposed to be smart, but he does something stupid to get out of trouble, and when it doesn't work, keeps doing the same stupid thing over and over again. It goes past being merely annoying and becomes obnoxious. This book is badly written, hard to finish, and has no redeeming features. Avoid."
5,Belongs in any serious Physics library,"John Bell's work was extremely valuable in sharpening our understanding of quantum mechanics, particularly the impossibility of local deterministic causality - you can't have both locality and hidden variables that determine quantum outcomes. This selection of Bell's writings has some technical material but there are also papers accessible to the non-specialist. For example, his ""Six possible worlds of quantum mechanics"" explores thoughts and interpretations from Bohr (Copenhagen), Einstein, de Broglie and Bohm (hidden variables), Everett (many worlds) and others. Highly recommended!"
4,"groundbreaking, but no longer controversial","This book is necessary for even the casual investigator of QM philosophy. Ideas once considered heresy are largely accepted now, but there are still competing interpretations. It is by no means settled. But the author shows how to think beyond just mechanically exploring the QM equations and consider the underlying implications."
3,Seems to work,I am ok with the product but it took a long time to get the product. I believe the sender actually had problems from a recent hurricane but I believe there was also oversight on the sender's part.
5,Repair scratched paint on your stove,"This product really works! Used it on the top of my white GE electric stove, right near the burner, and it did NOT turn dark from the heat (like ordinary ""appliance touch-up paint"" does). It takes a bit of care to get good coverage of the scratch, using the built-in brush. But the color matched my white stove quite well."
5,Looks Like A Winner,"Having used a similar product in the past, I ordered this Porcelain Touch-Up for my tub. I just applied my 1st coat and am very pleased with the coverage so far. It gives better coverage than other similar products. Before I apply,I prep the spot- remove all rust,rough up the surface a little bit for better adhesion. I apply with an artist's brush for more control and accuracy. I find that products such as this Touch-Up-Paint are best apllied in several thin coats. When applied to an older fixture it will seem very white to the eye but will seem to blend with use. I already know this repair will hold up for a long time."
5,Sheffield 1126 Porcelain Touch-Up,"I have used this product several times. It is great for fixing sinks. Other building retailers sell the product, but the bottle size is too small to complete the job. The Sheffield 1126 bottle size completed the job."
5,Great system,"Easy to apply with its companion ""Sheffield 1454 Porcelain Filler & Repair"" did a fine repair on our LG washer. While on can see the color difference if one looks closely, I have not ""noticed"" the repair in the tree months since it was completed."
1,Now how the heck am I going to get it off??!?,"The consistency looked pretty good going on - self levels, glossy. The color is a very pure white, which didn't quite match the somewhat grey-white of my stove, but that's my problem, not the product's. What is very irritating is that it has been two weeks now, and the stuff just does not harden. It's firm yet tacky, like really stiff silly putty or something. This is a gas range, I am wondering if the slightly elevated temp caused by the pilot light is the problem. When I put the burner covers back on the stove, they slowly sank into the slow-moving goo. I'm not even really certain what to do at this point. It would damage the stove more to get it off, I am quite sure. It looks slightly better, sort of. Kind of like a $3.32 repair, come to think of it..."
1,WHite is white except when it is not,I bought this for chips/scrapes that the maids put into my stove while cleaning. This leaves white spots that don't match frigidare. Hope you have better luck
2,Chip Stove - Still there,They product covered up the black but it did not make it where you could not see the stove damage. Also the white did not match the white of the stove.
1,Not really appliance or tub white,Not sure how people think this is the same color as a white appliance. It's far whiter. Appliance white has a gray tint to it. I used it on dings on a Whirlpool stove and a porcelain tub. Neither matched. It's not really even close. I can only hope washing it over time will dull/dirty the paint.
1,"Great seller, bad product","Great communication with the seller and I will buy from them again. However, this product id not worth the money - it becomes yellow when next to heat so it's kind of useless in the kitchen."
3,OK Stuff,"A large piece of porcelain broke off around the drain of the sink. With time it rusted. It took too coats to cover it, but after several days the rust broke through. Took two more coats to cover that. It looks like it was patched, but is better than the rusted spot."
4,Okay product,"The porcelain touch up product is a good fix for older items, my tub is less then three years old and there seems to be various shades of white. It filled in the hairline cracks well with the use to a toohpick vs the brush in the bottle. I also used it on an older tub (30 plus years) and on a larger ding and found it worked much better. I don't know if it will change color overtime since I only used it several weeks ago. I think it worth the puchase price."
4,touch up,I used it on my tub it had a small chip that rusted. I applied this product and it covered the chip and worked great.
1,Wrong Color,I ordered almond. Received WHITE (which is available at local stores). I gave it away as time spent on returning it was not worth the small cost of the product. No doubt the seller thought so too and figured that I would not bother. Annoying.
3,Basically white paint,"It covered the metal, but you can still tell there was a chip in my stove. I think it is not bad, but white paint could of done the same thing. I guess it has withstood cleaning, so I guess time will tell."
1,didn't work; tapping was better,The Sonin 50215 would not work on plaster walls despite several attempts. Simply tapping yielded good locations of the studs. The Sonin unit was returned.
1,Did not work,A stud finder that cannot find a stud! It was returned. Save yourself some time and look elsewhere for a stud finder.
1,Garbage,"I bought this thinking you have 4 tools in one for a decent price....it's garbage! It's only good for moisture detector...even that, I'm not even sure if it's accurate.. I would not recommend this product."
5,great product,Best value I have recieved in a long time . This item really works great and the delievery was exception. Would rcommend this to all contractors. T.K.
3,This album is only 11 minutes long,"There should be 1000 punk rock albums like this but there's probably only like 80.Pretty swinging for 240 beats per minute. They're talented enough to make longer songs -- try ""Detention Girl"", which would be a whole EP's worth of ideas for some bands -- but instead of building up to a resolution they just explode right out of the gate. And then it's over. Premature ejaculation rock, if you will.Which leads us to the cover, which is the real reason this sold 50x as much as ""Horror Stories"". See if you can get the vinyl (the CD is 2 minutes longer, by the way). Better still the 4 foot square promo poster."
4,A great escape!,"Artemis Fowl is one of those books with a main character that is both detestable and heartwarming, though mostly the former. Not since Gone With The Wind have I read a book with a main character so deliciously....well, foul. Artemis has a plot to restore his family's fortunes by kidnapping a fairy and holding her ransom. It's definitely a new twist on the traditional 'fairie tale', with delicious characters and clever plotting and dialogue. I can't wait to read The Arctic Incident!"
4,Artemis Fowl Fantasy at its Finest,"In my best judgement, I would reccomend Artemis Fowl to any one who enjoys fantasy writing. If you liked Harry Potter you'll love Artemis Fowl. It has many humorous twist and turns and there are serious points in this book also. Any thing about elves,fairies, other mythalogical creatures, and a twelve year old master mind is bound to be entertaining."
5,Arthemis Fowl,"The book is about a tweleve year old boy named Arthemis Fowl . Arthemis is different then most twelve year olds because he is a criminal mastermind , genius and a millionare . Arthemis thinks he can do everything until one day when he kidnaps afairy ,this is fariy from the Fariy Army . Soon Arthemis is in for a huge adventure .I liked this book because it had so much adventure in it .People say it is confusing , but you really have to pay attention .There was nothing I really did not like , that was how good it was. Arthemis Fowl is definetly one of the best books ever.This review was by L F"
4,Passing the time,I found this book to be very entertaining and more importantly a way to pass the time until Harry Potter book 5 comes out.I found it had an original plot and although it was not written perfectly it was a satisfying weekend read. I recommend reading it.
4,Artemis Fowl,"An excellent read for anyone. Yes, it does get a bit ahead of itself, but the characters are great. From a fairly new author(at least, I hadn't head of the author before) this book captures the true essance of evil and makes it somewhat good. This time, you're rooting for the bad and the good guys at the same time-and Artemis Fowl is irresistible. He has a good heart deep down...and brains that are obvious. A good mix of high-tech crimal modern world and olden day fairy enchantment world. Artemis Fowl suprised you by his age...and so will I. I'm only 12 also!"
5,A work of intelligence and adventure.,"This book couldn't be pried out of my hands until it was over! I love the unique combinations of Fantasy and adventure. The intelligence level of Artemis was another unusual element. I'm waiting for the sequel, and the movie."
5,Lots of fun,"I loved this book! I'm an adult and I don't have kids, so I can't address whether or not it's child-appropriate, but I thought it was great. It was charming, funny, different, fast-moving.The fact that the hero was a criminal is what drew me to buy the book...to me, that made it interesting. I couldn't wait to see which side was going to win.It seems likely that this will be a new series. If so, I look forward to reading the rest of the books. This one was a blast!"
3,Extrenely Disapointed,"My sister read this book and loved it. So I decided to give it a try. I was very disapointed. Every one is saying it is a good book, but I just didn't get it. Inside the cover of the book it says that ""Artemis thinks he's got them just where he wants them, but then they stop playing by the rules"". They referes to the faires and frankly I thought they did not stop playing by the rules. I could never quiete figure out who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. I also did not feel a develpment in the characters. I gave this book 3 stars becouse even though I did not enjoy it, the ideas were good, just not expressed well."
2,Good concept and story ruined by sloppy writing and editing,"I was really enjoying the story of the Artemis Fowl series, but I found I kept getting pulled out of it by the sloppy writing and editing. Everything from inconsistencies (in the second book there's mention of a purple gel which is described as orange on the next page), incorrect words (""Root was loosing his cool.""), and an over-reliance on adjectives (although, to be fair, I suppose that might be excusable as the book's targeted at a younger audience).I can only recommend this book if you can get past this sort of thing. I, personally, can not, and gave up on the series after the second book."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I bought this book searching for action and fun, not a dreary story about how some scheming, horrible kid captures and practically tortures a fairy for money. Near the end of the book, I was hoping the fairies would win and wipe out the inhabitants of the Fowl Manor, especally the evil (and somewhat bratty) main character.Some of the writing was confusing,too. I'll never understand how the blue-rinse didn't work. The sleeping pills were for the stopped time! I'm planning on reading the next book, and I hope it's not as disappointing and depressing as this one."
2,"Well,","Okay this is about the stupidest book out there. First of all it seems as if the main character is the villian. Secondly the Faeries are little 'high-tech' fairies. Yes, Faeries are one thing, and fairies are another. Oh boy, could it get any more boring to read? Yes, when I started reading this I thought I could get past the boring beginning, but it went on until the end. It is not fantasy, it is not sci-fi, it is STUPID. This is more annoying than the 5th Harry Potter book! Which may I say, dishoners dragons and magic, and has a bratty teenager in it, muh like our friend Artemis with the latter. Artemis can dishoner its own things, like Faeries. And they have guns. Oh Cool! Magical little leprecauns with guns! This book is much safer closed."
2,Don't believe the hype!!!,"This book is definitely not as good as advertised. This was a very big disappointment for me. I found Artemis Fowl to be a character who is not very believable. His attitude, the way he talks... definitely not a likable character. Plot is thin. Not very interesting."
3,Disappointing -- to say the least,"This book should never be compared to the Harry Potter series. It doesn't EVEN compare. Standing on its own it is ""just okay."" It was an easy read but not very stimulating -- even for a young reader. I purchased it for my grandson and, as usual, I read it first to make sure it was appropriate. I passed it off to him but when I asked him how he was enjoying it a week later he said he thought it was ""dumb."" I don't mean to infer it wasn't a pleasant read, but even the Hardy Boys mysteries have it beat. I wish I could be more positive about it -- I really WANTED it to be a good and exciting books but it was too predictable and dry. :("
2,I'm not ready for techno-faeries.,"I have to give credit for great imagination in concept, but I'm not impressed by the execution.The villain is obviously patterned on Moriarty, with the added interest of the master criminal at a young age. At least we're told he's twelve, I'd have forgotten if we weren't reminded because there is nothing in the writing to give the feel of youth.Instead of a classic battle between modern human technology and ancient faery magic we have faeries with even more advanced technology (but with magic too to make them so powerful we're supposed to forgive the villain his villainy).The villain is villainous but not interesting. The faeries aren't faery like (they've got a centaur for a Mr. Scott, but without the brogue)."
3,Harry Potter? No Way!,"I read this book just recently and I have to admit, it was pretty funny and intelligent but it cannot compare to Harry Potter. JK Rowling has invented characters that I have fallen in love with. Artemis Fowl, Butler, Juliet and Holly are exactly what they are-characters in a book. To me, this book could NEVER compare to Harry Potter. But I'm glad I read Artemis Fowl anyway."
2,Interesting...,"I enjoyed the book, but I found it to be a little bit too technical. The author goes into great detail about how each and every little thing works, so it was cool from a technology aspect, but sometimes dragged on. It seems as though someone not familiar with certain types of technology might not understand a lot of what he was talking about. However, the plot was great, but it was just too wordy for my taste."
5,The next children's literary phenomena,"Finally, a protagonist/ antagonists who's actually mean-sprited, superficial, genius, and downright bad- excellent! I have gotten fed up with goody-goody characters busy with 'finding themselves and who they are' (aka Harry Potter- i luv him, but he's such a wussy), and this is finally the character i always wanted to read about! Moreover, the novel creates a parallel world like Rowling's but more realistic; there is more resentment to humans, government problems (eg budget) like ours, and use of technology, etc. Colfer better come out with sequalS soon!"
3,not as bad as i expected,i like this book [....] i found good and intresting. yes it not as good as harry potter but there two totally differnt sort of books. i was confused though if the author wants us to sympthizie with the fairys or artimus.
3,Not Up To Harry Potter's High Standards,"This book is not as magical or detailed as the Harry Potter books. In my opinion, the genius of Harry Potter is that since Harry was unaware he was a wizard he views the magical world from our point of view.Artemis Fowl on the other hand has been raised to be mischevious and creates havoc & war against innocent fairies from day one. If anything, Artemis Fowl is more Draco Malfoy than Harry Potter.All of that being said, it is a very easy book to read as the last half of it is detailing an 8 hour battle. I gave it 3 stars because there are so many better comparable stories out there. The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, So You Want to Be A Wizard & The Young Wizard Series by Diane Duane & The Hero From Otherwhere by Jay Williams just to name a few."
5,"Fun, light, and emotionally satisfying.","So far I've read three of the books in this series. The fantasy world is fun and comic. Even the supporting characters are memorable. Lots of action and adventure and the evil doesn't go too dark. So far the endings have been uplifting with a genuine ""aah, that's nice"" feeling."
5,Loved it then... love it now,I read this as a kid when it first came out. Still a charming whimsical story! Great for kids and adults!
3,Interesting theme and idea,I'm midway reading this book and the start seems to be quite interesting. The story is fast paced and if you're into works involving fantasies this is definitely worth the read.I bought this book when it was on a promotion period and didnt pay anything for it. I cannot speak for whether it's worth the 6$ its priced at.
4,Great for Young Adults,"I've heard about this book over the years and finally picked it up on my Kindle when it was offered for free. It was a fun read, a bit predictable given the target audience. However, for anyone, regardless of age, that is just looking for a fun read this is a good choice."
4,good read,Really liked this story. Well told with good story line. Reminds me of the 39 clues series. Cant wait to read the rest of this series.
2,Book review,"I thought that the book was really slow especially in the beginning. Also don't read it if you do not like fairies because it is mostly about them. I did like the end the most because there was more action in it, and it was ongoing with action. I liked how she stayed with the same people in the story so then you knew them better and understood it..."
3,Artemis Fowl Revisited by Kristen White,"Artemis Fowl by Erin Colfer is a fantasy with 220 pages. It's about a 12 year old boy named Artemis who is trying to get leprachaun gold. He hopes to make his family rich again. He kidnaps and holds the leprachaun, Holly, for ransom. She has a lot of armement. When I was reading this is reminded me of the army and the weapons they use. This is a text to self connection because my older brother is in the army national guard. I give this book three stars because the beginning was uninteresting to me but the story was great!"
2,Colfer hits a foul ball,"This book is written at too high of a level for kids, yet isn't a very interesting story for adults. Ninety nine percent of kids under the age of 13 will have difficulty keeping up with the dialog, which often rambles on between characters without attributing the source. In addition, the vocabulary, although fine for adults, is well beyond the intended audience. A little literary stretch may be good, but this goes too far. I found the story dry, and the ending anticlimatic. I suppose Captain Short is the protagonist we are supposed to cheer, but most other characters didn't appeal to me. J. K. Rowling can sleep well."
5,Not so Much For Harry Potter Fans,"Almost every other fantasy book that has come out since Harry Potter has been said to be for Harry Potter fans. I however, wouldn't say the same thing. An entirely different sort of pace with characters that could never resemble Harry Potter.I loved this book, it was very catchy. The whole idea of capturing a fairy for ransom and fairies fighting back was very amusing to me. Eoin Colfer has given a whole new meaning to ""fairies"" and ""magic"".Buy it and read it!"
5,My 10-year old son loved the book,My son aged 10 just simply loved the book. He can't wait to finish reading the series. He is on to the 5th one.
2,Didn't like it,"I found it a little dark for my tastes. It was like good was stupid and bad was good. I think it was advocating for being a bad guy because all the bad guys got away with everything. I don't think that's a great message, especially for young people. Not a fan of this series, won't be buying more."
3,Good but shallow,I pre-read most everything my children read and my son really wanted this so I gave in. This novel has an okay story but there's not much detail or depth to the characters. I guess that's to be expected with a book for 8 year olds but I've read others that had surprising depth and very real characters in the same age group.
4,Artemis Fowl,"Artemis Fowl is a compeling story of faries, money, and life.Artemis Fowl is a determined twelve year old genious. Due to his fathers unethical problems, such as gambling, and stealing, the Fowl family fortune is deminiting. So it is up to the determined young mastermind to restore it and he is willing to go to any extent to get what it is he wants.If you have the time, I recomend that you at least try to read Artemis Fowl and find out that even the smartest of us need love."
5,Dont judge this book by its cover,"ARTEMIS FOWLArtemis, the twelve year old genius wants to take over the world. It seems he is always one step ahead. When Artemis and his commando butler steal a mysterious book from an old fairy, it seems his plan is coming together.Meanwhile, below ground there is a civilization of trolls, dwarves, fairies and other creatures. One of them, Captain Holly Short, part of the fairy police, is sent above ground to recapture a troll that has escaped the underground. It seems this fits perfectly with Artemis's plan. Will he take over the world or will the yet unknown hero stop him?I would definitely recomend this to anyone who loves suspense and action. Personally i think it was better than harry potterjust sayin"
5,Brilliant Reading,"Even if you aren't a fan of children's books, the performance of Parker is one of the best I've ever heard. He peppers the story with exquisite accents, from Artemis' soft brogue to Root's growling tones. And his collection of accents only spreads the further you go into the series.A fantastic story read by a brilliant performer. You shouldn't miss this."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Great book i love that its a new take on fairy tales and the protagonist is the villain and he is not just a flat character! When are they going to finally make the Artemis Fowl movie ? :(
3,teacher has mixed feelings about this book,"The summary sounded interesting when I purchased it, but upon reading the story, I was a bit surprised about the violence. I am a 6th grade teacher and I'm not so sure I would read this book aloud to my class. That isn't to say that I wouldn't make the book available to them if they wanted to read it themselves. I'm sure the author could've been less descriptive about the types of weapons and violent acts, but reading some other reviews, kids loved this book. I, personally, found the book an interesting and fun read and I think that the code cracking pat is a great idea for kids to practice their decoding skills. If your child is mature enough, I think this is a good book for them to read."
4,Artemis Fowl,"I enjoyed Artemis Fowl a lot! It was verey intresting.I would only recomend this book to any advanced reader. It was slightly hard to understand, but it still was great. If you liked Harry Potter, you'll love Artemis Fowl."
4,Give this to your son,"As a parent trying to keep my son away from the gun violence so prevalent in our popular culture, I am extremely thankful to Eoin Colfer for writing this series! Harry Potter kept my son busy when he was 9 but by the time he turned 10 he had read them all twice and his teacher recommended the Alex Rider series--full of machine guns! So, thank goodness for Artemis Fowl, full of adventure, strategy, high tech gagetry, yes some-appropriate violence, but also very age appropriate humor. There is a dwarf who's main weapon is his backside...I won't elaborate. This keeps my son from whining for video games, and passes the ""can I tell my friends about this book and still be cool"" test. Four stars out of five only because J.K. Rawling set the bar for five so high."
2,Not the next big book series,"So. This book I enjoyed, but not nearly as much as Maximum ride, Percy Jackson and the Olympains, or really anything Rick Riordan and James Patterson wrote (I highly recommend the series stated above). The plotline was good, but for only one book. I read up to the second or third book, and I must admit, the plotline of the three books, all together, didn't fit. There wasn't too much good humor, and it wasn't witty, with the exception of mabye two statements. One minute Artemis was trying to capture Holly, a fairy, and the next he's trying to rescue something(I actually can't remember, but I know that's at least close) with her. Sorry if I confused you.Let me summarize. This book was a fail (to me) and the first book seemed liked the last. There wasn't much of a point to it either. So no offense to the people who like this book, but it wasn't good, but I wouldn't recommend it book for the life of it."
3,"OK, but no Harry Potter","I read this book in all of three hours one lazy afternoon. It was exciting and kept my interest. I felt it did not deserve the truly negative reviews in the New York Times Review of Books and Newsweek (or Time). I enjoyed it. I did find the characters interesting, if rather stock and cliched in some regards. I imagine my older children may enjoy it. However, if you're looking for the next Harry Potter, this is NOT it. While funny, it lacks the wholehearted humor of the Potter books and its plot was not as compelling. It's use of magic is limited, with the elves being more technologically advanced than humans. It felt more like a kid's sci-fi novel than a fantasy one. Still,it had some nifty concepts and an exciting finish, and I recommend it, as long as you're not looking for a Harry Potter clone."
3,"Artemis Fowl, a great but somewhat failed book","Artemis Fowl has a very clever plot to it but did not go into as much detail as I had hoped. I know that I am one of the only people that thinks this but MOST OF THE BOOK is written in a very poor, matter-of-fact way. It states things and then BOOM, on to the next idea. Not very much description. If the book had more background information then maybe it would have been better. A four-star perhaps."
3,I bought it I read it,"The book lacks deminsional characters but is fun to read. The characters are stereotypical, the person who wants to take over the world and his servant and obviously the people who try to stop them, in this case fairies. I do, however, recommend this book if you have a few hours to kill for some laughs. I did just buy the third book from the series as I am not totally disinterested. Happy reading!"
2,Harry Potter meets Tom Clancy,"I guess I was expecting a story that was a little bit ""nicer"" than what I found. I have a hard time saying this book would be a good read for kids when the twelve year old main character uses deceit and blackmail to get what he wants, not mention the fact that he seems to have a full arsenel of weapons to choose from and no reservations about using them."
1,Artemis Fowl,"This book is crass. What else can I say? I only gave it one star for that reason. Reviews should warn, too. And I'm just a teen, not an adult."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This book stunk. It was so hard to understand. I don't know if I'm just really dumb or this book is based towards adults. There were words in there that my parents wouldn't understand. It was so boring. It was a total waste of money and I suggest you wait a long time before you read this book. I would try books by Lemony Snicket, J.K. Rowling, and Philip Pullman.(...)"
1,Utter Dreck,"So much for the hype. This book has a lot of words, somewhat of a plot pretext, tons of clichés and none of the actual literature to pull it off. I found nothing believable (see 'suspension of disbelief'). The characters were flat, and I found the relentless diatribe against humans to be completely insulting. Read it if you want, but remember if you do, you will only encourage bad authors to continue to produce bad novels."
2,Ok,"No I didnt really like the book I mean the story itself is nice. But the words are soo hard to understa,d!!!!"
3,Not exactly impressive,"I think what I find least appealing about this book is that our ""hero""--who we are supposed to admire, relate to, and root for--is simply a thief, and not a very interesting one at that. If he were truly as clever as Sherlock Holmes (he's certainly as cocky), I would at least be interested in his intellect. Yet his advantage stems almost entirely from the array of technology available to him as a result of his wealth. Not even his fleeting concern for his mother or his hostage make him remotely sympathetic. I am impressed by Colfer's imaginative machinery, but it too often serves to mask the weak plotline and ill-developed characters."
5,One Heck of a Book,"I liked this book better than Harry Potter because its different: The main character is the bad guy, for example. It was a very thrilling novel. It was totally unpredictable, you didn't know who was going to win--which is quite unusual in a kid's book. If you liked The Golden Compass for its dark side and are around 11 years old, I predict you'll like this book. I hope this review was helpful to you"
4,Nice book,"A little strange at some parts, but an awesome book overall. I don't know if I will get the next one until I feel that I am ready for something like this."
4,Decent read,"New to the Artemis Fowl series and was actually reading it to get a feel for the caliber of the book and story content before allowing my child to read it. But D'arvit, I actually enjoyed it myself! =)"
5,Amazing,"I loved this book.First I will make a confession: I did not read this book for the summary. I know that people are a little driven away by the word ""fairies"". I picked it up for the shiny cover. I sat down, and read the whole thing in one sitting, because i could not stop reading. Why this is the weakest in the series, it is still a five-star book. Every character was well-developed, the plot was fast, and the humor was top-notch. There are so many memorable quotes, and scenes that even after the book was finished the scenes kept coming back. While it could be a stand-alone, Colfer leaves the door open for another book (seven more. :)) I recommedn this to anyone, even adults. Great Read"
5,Best book I've ever read!,"Artemis Fowl is a great book, and even though it seems very serious, it is actually quite funny.Artemis Fowl is a twelve-year-old criminal mastermind, who also happens to be a genius. But when Artemis kidnaps (or should I say fairynaps?) Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon Unit, he might have made a mistake. These fairies are armed and dangerous. When they stop playing by the rules, he starts to regret what he did. Or does he?"
4,Enjoy it!,"For young readers this is an excellent story. Here you meet Artemis Fowl a boy genious, who is part of an infamous crime family. The story is straightforward, the plot doesn't have very many unexepted turns, but makes up for it with loads of fun. Sometimes, even with hillarious laugh out loud moments.While this isn't a deep story, I think young readers will enjoy the story. Have fun, definitely set aside some time. You'll be glad you did."
5,One of the best books of the year!!!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I read it over and over until my mother bought me the second book, which I'm still reading. From what I've read so far, it seems like it maybe better than the first. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a very good imagination and enjoys books that make them laugh, and makes them think hard at the same time."
4,Great read for kids with a sophisticated vocabulary,"We just started reading this one a few days ago, and I love it. Some of the words, and phrases are challenging for my 7 & 9 year old, though, so I pause every so often while I am reading to explain some of the new vocabulary words. I think it's going to be a fantastic series. High tech for ""today's kids"", yet some of the same concepts of the adventure/fantasy books I read when I was the same age as my sons.I do wish people would stop comparing this book with the Harry Potter series, though. While it is a wonderful series to read, so were the Boxcar Children books, the Jedi Apprentice series and Captain Underpants books. Each is different, and to compare them does justice to none."
4,Artemis Fowl,"make sure that you convert the symobls on the bottom of the pages...it will tell you more. plus, it's fun!!!"
2,Pretty Good,This is a very good book and you should read it. The only thing I don't like about it is the it gets very boring with the fairies and also you start to zoom off and not understan what happens. It has very hard words that even my sixteen year old sister didn't understand. Pretty Good
5,Deserves six stars!,"This is probably the best book that i have ever read. It has humour, fairy gadgets and technology and a boy genius with a master plan all in one! This book kept me hanging on the edge of my seat till the very end, i strongly suggest that you get it!"
2,Hmm.,"So I bought this book because I've seen it in stores/online/etc. I didn't like it too much, I like Artemis and Butler but that's about it. I bought the second to see if it was better than the first, it was. I bought the third to see if it was better than the second, it was. I bought the forth to see if it was better than the third, it was. And I bought the fifth because I liked the rest, and the fifth was awesome.What I'm trying to get at is, don't be turned off by the first, because THEY DO get better."
3,Good book to tide me over until Harry Potter returns,"I like artemis, but the Bartemaeus Trilogies are better."
3,It's having problems....,"Im only half way thorough the 5th chapter, but I have found that this book just keeps me asking questions. They don't give enough info. And theres not alot of detail. Sometimes I just have no idea what they're talking about, I just get lost! Example: When Artemis is fiddling around with some screws and a magnet, they dont give enough backround to whats going on, so I have no idea where or what they're doing. It feels like the author was just so enthusiastic about the story, he left out abunch of needed details for he was in some kind of flurry....For now, I give this book a three, this is a very frusterating story..."
1,But the cover is nice...,"The hardcover version of the book has wonderful embossing and holographic sparkles. I read the entire book, but did it only to finish. I enjoy children's and young adult books, but this book won't delight any young readers. I can only describe the style of this book as unhumorous film noire. It's dark, it's violent, and has no redemming qualities, other than the nice cover."
2,Swinging in on the coat tails of Harry Potter Fever,"Although there were some interesting details, this book was difficult to finish. It lacked the good hearted theme of innocence conquers evil that Harry Potter is noted for. There was very little innocence in this book.Artemis Fowl was not a believable character. He was a robotic character with few human characteristics. This prevented me from identifying with the character.Technology buffs may find the book entertaining but if you stop and think about it, fairys are nature loving creatures who dislike the idea of technology. And why would they need technology? They are magical beings.Eoin Colfer is a talented writer and his ideas are interesting but I do not feel this book has the universal appeal of Harry Potter and should not be promoted as a fix for Harry Potter buffs."
3,While you're waiting for the next Harry Potter book...,"Artemis Fowl is a good book for a child or an adult to read while they're waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out. While it does touch on the subject of magic - magic used by creatures such as fairies, the hero isn't a wizard in training, something a little different than the glut in that area caused by JK Rowling's books. It does get a little boring in spots, its a book that you CAN put down. It doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat like Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Harry Potter. If you can, wait for the paperback version."
4,first book excellent,"The first artemis fowl book was excellent, a blend of different types of prose. The magic is universal; it gave the story more punch. But Eoin Colfer combined technology with the supernatural, he made the People technologically advanced , and yet they have to follow a simple book that controls their magic. But the real work of art here is Artemis Fowl, a 12-year-old mastermind that manages to trick the faeries out of one ton of gold.If you really like this book, consider buying the whole series,and try to carry a supply of acorns in your pocket for any unshielded fairy you happen to meet."
5,This book rocks,"This book is cool , the concept is great it's like getting paid to eat or sitting it's as cool as like any thing I've read so far!:)..."
3,Ok,It was ok but not to much of a fan of the writing . The main character was not very likable. Not going to read the next book.
4,Explosive,Although the idea that a stylist twelve year old would be able to do this is farfetched....the book and its plotline were great. Kept me involved from page one.
3,Not as epic as I thought it would be,"They created this crazy amazing world in the beginning, and then all the crazy super technology, but about 70%+ of the book took place within the house. This is just my opinion & I have not read the other books in the series but I was a little disappointed in this aspect. Overall though the plot and (like mentioned earlier) imaginary world + other aspects were what kept me going. I hope there's more action in the other books..."
4,"Good Read, Buy It","Artemis Fowl is a great book. Although it has some of the same creatures, it is nothing like Harry Potter. Artemis Fowl is a twelve year old criminal mastermind, who is trying to revive the family ""Billionaire Status"". Artemis' Dad, Artemis Senior has gone missing in the arctic (Read the 2nd book to find out more, #2 is a little better than this.) With the help of his trusty bodyguard Butler, they go and steal a copy of the fairy bible ""THE BOOK"". Artemis, becomes the first human to ever translate the book into english. He finds out their secrets, and steals a fairy when she comes to perform her ritual. Little did he know, this was not any old fairy, this was Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon unit. The police force of the underworld. Artemis brings her to his mansion and holds her hostage, so the fairies try to get her back while Artemis tries to get their gold."
5,Move over Harry and give way Hardy Boys-,"This is not your ""out to save the world"" character.Little Artimus Fowl is a criminal mastermind- smart enough to crack the codes of an ancient Faery bible without much brain sweat. Accompanied by the rather huge Butler, his personal body guard, and his little sister Juliet, a bodyguard in training, there's nothing Master Fowl thinks can stop him.Or is there?A delightful, deepthful journey through not only this world and the one below us but into the imagination of a great story teller! Beware- if you read this you're going to be begging for the next one- the ""Arctic Incident"" and the most recent third one ""The Eternity Code."" I'm waiting for the fourth one which, if #3 is any indication just bet getter and better."
2,"My kids love it, I have reservations","I picked up this book for my kids without realizing it was a current ""hot"" book. It seems to go over well with children in the 9 through 12 age range (and perhaps older) but as a parent I had 2 concerns with it.1) There are many descriptions that detail and perhaps glorify weapons of various kinds as well as related paraphenelia, from rocket-propelled grenades to various kinds of hand guns.2) In many places I found the writing clumsy or awkward. It just did not appear to me as an example of good writing in any sense, and I have not had this level of distaste for the writing of a childrens book before."
3,"A good book, but...","A good book, it was interesting, but i forgot about it quickly. I know, that might be kind of hard to understand, so i'll try to explain. You know how the really good books always stick in your mind? Like you never forget the characters, and some you may even daydream about (hehe ;))? Well, this book, I just forgot about. THen i saw the second book in Walden's (the bookstore at the mall i go to) and bought it. I still haven't read it. I read the first page or so, but couldn't really get into it. Read if you want."
1,Artemis Fowl,"Couldn't get beyond the first couple of chapters. I kept rereading the same thing because it kept losing me. I'm really not that bad a reader so I figure it was the lack of purpose, unpleasant characters, phony dialogue and unsuccessful attempts at humor that made me lose interest."
3,"Great, but confusing at the begining...","i thought that this book was really great, and i read a lot of books like this so i have a lot to compare it too. it is a great idea i don't see how people come up with such great ideas for books. i read in some of the other reviews that some people are copmaring Artemis Fowl to Harry Potter books, well i have read harry potter books (and loved them) but they are completly differant to Artemis Fowl. the only thing i want to know about this book is wheather there are other books in a series after it (or maybe before)? the only thing was that at the begining i found it too bea bit comfusing but when i got into it it was great and u just have to get used to all the differant, but clever, ideas. a great read and recomended to everyone."
2,Harry beats Artemis Hands Down,"I purchased this book because the name intrigued me and the editorial review said that Artemis Fowl was a sophisticated story that would do for Fairies what Harry Potter did for Wizardry. I thought it would be a fun vacation read. Potter fans, don't let that review suck you in, too.Artemis was only mildly amusing, and had none of the positive messages that J.K. Rowling shares in Harry's stories. The plot was pitifully simplistic and predictable, and the characters shallow. Artemis reminded me of a bad Stallone movie or a take off on a bad spy novel. This one is definitely for less sophisticated readers than those Potter appeals to. I’m over 30 and I’m not ashamed to say I’ve read all 4 Potter stories and frequently recommend them to my friends – and not just those with kids.At best, Artemis is OK. It kept me occupied while it rained."
1,NOT FOR SMART PEOPLE,"Do not buy this book! ESPECIALLY if you are considering it for children! Its ""style"" is completely wannabe cinematic, with too much description of guns and tough-guy-shots. If you've ever read a sci-fi story written by an over-enthusiastic fifteen-year-old boy... it was better than Artemis Fowl. Plus, every other sentence starts with ""and"" or ""but"", and the faked medieval style combined with the James Bond-esque action sequences is ridiculous.Oh, and I cracked the code in about 20 seconds, it's a direct orthographical one from the English Alphabet. I mean, come on. You can just correspond the individual symbols to letters on the opposite page... ""translation"" indeed! The code at the bottom is about a guy who reads the future... in *phlegm*."
1,waste of time,"If you want to read books like Harry Potter, pick up CS Lewis or JR Tolkien instead. They will stimulate your imagination. This book is not worth reading. I found this book to be excessively violent with material not at all appropriate to its target audience. Its frequently repetitive explanations of simple concepts insult the intelligence of its reader and the descriptions of weaponry and violence seemed a bit over the top. How anyone could classify this book anywhere near Harry Potter is beyond me. The writing is ponderous and dull and the story is not at all engaging. Had the editors taken a bit more time, they might have been able to make something of this story. Unfortunately, it feels like it was thrown together at the last minute to ride the coattails of the Harry Potter phenomenon."
2,Not the next Potter,"Artemis Fowl is often compared to Harry Potter but it doesn't live up to the hype. Sadly, Colfer isn't as good of a writer as Rowling. His writing was both dull and cliché ridden, and the main character mean-spirited and unlikable. This is besides the fact that Artemis Fowl promotes and glorifies extortion, which will not thrill watchful parents. Admittedly, Harry Potter has its faults but is a more enjoyable read. I advise Potter fans to look elsewhere for a substitute until book five is published."
1,Who Cares?,"OK I'm an adult, so I accept that I'm not the target audience for this book but I can't imagine anyone being entertained by this load of tosh!The premise is fine - a junior version of Moriarty and his servants engaged in a nefarious plan to defraud the fairy nation of a crock of gold by holding one of their kind to ransom.Problem is the author has created a set of totally unengaging characters who you will struggle to find interesting or have any sympathy with. This means that by the halfway mark, you really don't care what happens.The author has spent a good deal of time thinking through the action and the technology (this is the only part of the book that vaguely works and is why I've given it the 1 star)and I'm sure this will thrill the right type of young audience but older readers will find little in the way of characterisation or plot to keep their attention.Unfunny at best, dull as dishwater at worst, this Artemis is truly more foul than fowl!"
1,not up to the hype,"Definately not up to all the hype. It is NOT like harry potter at all! It lacks the character development, plot developments and twists that a harry potter book contains. Not to mention the dark feel to this book."
4,Lots of Fun,"I'm a mother of an 8 year old, so I read a lot of children's books. This one is without a doubt ranks up there with the most enjoyable. I found myself laughing out loud in public, and I had as much fun cracking the code that runs along the bottom of each page as my kid. (maybe even more!) Very fun book! Witty, intelligent, fun read!"
5,one of my favoite books!,"This is one of my favorite books. I highly recommend this book to all readers who like action, adventure, and a good book. Dont think that this book is just another domb fairy tale that you listend to as a kid just because it has fairys in it. Theas fairys are smart,clever,mistevous and somtimes a bit crule,and the only one who can out smart them is 12 year old criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl. The only one who can stay one step ahaed of them always in a plot to take ther gold. The Artemis Fowl books are 2nd to none."
4,Artemis Fowl,"Artemis Fowl is a fun filled book that everyone should read. If you like books that have adventure around every corner then you should read this one. Some characters have odd personalities like Butler who has weapons in every pocket, shoe and sleeve. Artemis Fowl is a type of guy who does something and enjoys it. He sticks to what he does and believes in following a fairy with gold or a leprechaun. Does this sound like a normal person to you? For Artemis this is a fun filled adventure in his everyday life."
2,This is NOT for kids!!,"Let me preface that I have only read the first 50 pages of the book - but I feel as though I was duped! The book was displayed in the Childrens section of (store name) and when my 8 year old saw it - it seemed like Harry Potter all over agian. I read the book jacket and a review and thought this book would tide us over until HP#5 finally hit the store. Unfortunatly - this book is way too over the top for anyone under middle school age. When you start talking ""fine Irish whiskey"" and ""syrynges shooting into her veins"" - I have to draw the line, and that was just in the first few pages. Now, despite my living in the 'bible belt' - I am not a prude. I am a firm believer in freedom of expression. I also believe that if you don't like the message of a book - you don't have to ban it, just don't read it! This is just a warning to parents that this book is probably not the best choice for kids!"
2,Artemis Fowl not for impressionable children.,"This attempt to ride the coat tales of Harry Potter, misses the mark. Artemis does not teach good versus evil. Artemis comes from a family with a criminal background and thinks this is the right way to do business. I also thought the description of violence was to graphic for children to read. When our children read, we should NOT show them the way to get around what is right. I enjoyed the book but will not let my grandchildren read it. MR Colfer would be better off using his great imagination to write adult fantasy."
3,Overall Clean Read,"Picture him, an evil, brilliant, mastermind determined to exploit the secret community of magical creatures co-existing with humans in our world. There's only one catch - he's twelve years old.Artemis Fowl starts slow, but picks up speed and interest as the book progresses. As a Preteen/Young Adult book it provides a very different type of story written from the villain's point of view, with side glimpses at the individuals endeavoring to stop him. Readers should be aware that the book does contain some bathroom type humor/situations, cussing in fairy language, and drugs used to sedate, but is an overall clean read."
3,"Too much hype, not enough meat","I bought this book on the basis of all the hype (""the next Harry Potter..."") and found that although the story was enjoyable enough it seemed a bit ""dashed"" together. There is only a minimum amount of character development and the set-pieces sometimes lack a bit of coherence.As a new parent I spend a fair amount of time reading books in anticipation of my child someday wanting to read them. I think this book will be enjoyable for my daughter when she reaches the appropriate age."
4,A great fantasy with a snarky main character,"I have been a fan of Artemis Fowl for a long time. It is one fantasy series that I recommend over and over. I love the snarky attitude Artemis constantly displays (and sometimes uses to hide other feelings...). He is the little boy genius that wants to take over the world...but finds he meets his match. When Artemis discovers that fairies really exist, he has no idea what he's really in for in challenging them. I love that they are a blend of earthen magic and technology. Foaly, a centaur and technology genius, is actually one of my favorite characters of all time. This book blends awesome adventure, great character quips, and fantasy to create a brilliant new world."
5,"best seires i have ever read!, reganne wolfe",this is one of the most interesting series i have ever read and it will compel you to read more.and i was was at a young age when i started the reading of reading this thrilling series. HARRY make way for arty! keep the good books coming eoin!
1,NOT REMASTERED!!!!,"I wish I would have read the user review before purchasing this CD. I got so excited at the idea of a remastered Loveless; I had to preorder it. Unfortunately, this CD sounds EXACTLY like the original. This is so disappointing and I am actually quite upset about the misleading and downright false album description. Stay away from this. If you don't have the album, buy the domestic copy."
5,Perfection,"This album is possibly the greatest album of the nineties. Led by Kevin Shields ('Lost in Translation' soundtrack) My Bloody Valentine achieved untoppable greatness on this record. Towering walls of sound, beautiful music and fantastic lyrics combine to great effect. Listen in your car at night driving in the country with the wondows down or through headphones. I can't believe it is so cheap here, definitely worth your money.2000man"
5,Beauty + Chaos = My Bloody Valentine,"The title of this review is a simple way to describe my first listen to MBV's ""Loveless."" I borrowed it from a roommate, tucked myself and my headphones into bed and pressed Play. I was expecting to drift off after a few songs . . . that didn't happen. I'd never heard anything like it - a gorgeous softness paired with nearly unbearable distortion. Can something exist as overpoweringly delicate, softly crushing or soothingly chaotic? After listening to ""Loveless,"" I would argue yes, yes and yes.If you are willing to try something completely original (still, even after 15+ years), try the masterfully orchestrated chaos of ""Loveless."" I think you'll find all these oxymorons wonderfully appropriate, but also gloriously inadequate . . . and therein lies the genius!"
1,"A new definition for ""terrible""","Oh dear Jesus. This has to be one of the worst albums every recorded in the history of time. It sounds like a bunch of badly recorded noies thrown together with lyrics no one can comprehend. How they get off selling this for $11 boggles the mind. This seems like the kind of music you'd find in a nickel cassette bin at a car wash.If you have any taste in anything whatsoever do not buy this cd. Even buying it as a joke encourages them to make more terrible music of this nature. Or not, seeing as how they've done absolutley nothing for the last ten years."
3,insanely overrated,"""Pet Sounds""? ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness""? ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot""? ""Slanted and Enchanted""? Hell, even ""OK Computer""? NONE of those hold a candle to the overrating people do to this album. Yes, the guitar sounds are beautiful and flow perfectly, yes, ""Sometimes"" is incredibly brilliant and the reason this album gets 3 stars. I realize that the whole point of this is to drone, but really, even for ambient/shoegazer/wtfever music, it's not that good. The songs are underdeveloped and cause the album to drag in several places. Slowdive's ""Souvlaki"" was much prettier, as another reviewer said, and Yo La Tengo's ""I Can Feel the Heart Beating as One"" is ten times more beautiful. It might have been innovative at the time, but why listen to it when other bands have done it ten times better since?"
5,Defies description,"I've listened to this album for the past week and still can't even describe it except to say it truly is exceptional.I've listened to a lot of music but never anything as authentically enchanting as this album, it starts off with a hectic guitar wail, but falls in and out of guitar distortion with instantly memorable hooks and tunes that seem to emerge from nowhere.I know what I've said so far seems like flowery critic language, but it's the best way I can describe it.The lyrics are completely unintelligible to me, but still sound great.I believe this cd is a misunderstood masterpiece and deserves a solid five out of five."
4,Noisy and Beautiful,"I just saw Lost in Translation and the song Sometimes was used in it, so I had to rush home and pull this classic back out. Guitars swirl, synths blossom, and some breathy woman sings about something we'll never understand,almost beautiful enough to bring a tear to your eye. Too bad there was never a follow up to this, I think the band figured they could never top this work of genius so just didn't try. Gorgeous with enough noise pop to keep it from becoming too precious. A must own."
5,i don't know what's real...,"everything is turning pink and lavender, breaking out in spectral lights that reflect and blind Venusian eyelids. but the eyelids are not blinded, they see lava spurts of foreign planets and digital circumcisions reveresed. everything pink purple blue yellow sedated green neon overglow, rings around the moons spell out Kevin Shields and My Bloody Valentine in phospheresecent crayon colours. your soul will fill with melancholy, transcendant beauty of an abstract nature. the distortions will spurt out lovely measurements of noise and melody, bringing tears of ecstasy. Absolutely breathtaking music, shoegazer is it's own world. from the first note to the last note. mbv's best album. perfection. buy or burn the eps too."
5,Absolutely exquisite,"Like some previous reviewers, I don't know that I can add any more praise that hasn't already been beautifully expressed. But simply put, this CD is so rich, so intricate, so masterful. I never tire of the vocal instrumentation or the blanket sounds; the dull pulse of percussion, or the guitars expressed like cellos. My greatest joy in experiencing Kevin Shields' music on this CD, aside from enjoying it so deeply, is finding that many others just simply don't get it and only hear ""noise"". This is living proof to me that most of us only preceive what we want in life, not what is truly there."
2,there's something wrong with this cd,that will be your reaction to this cd. it sounds like a warped vinyl lp stuck in a groove. cd technology was supposed to cure these problems. it hasn't if its a work of art your dealing with! in some circles this is a work of art. in others its an unlistenable piece of noise. choose your circle. i'm adding 1 star for audacity. p.s. i was listening to yo la tengo's new compilation box when i thought the cd was stuck in place. i checked and found out it was only kevin shields at work again. you can't keep a good man down i guess .
2,not sure about this 'classic'...,"I like some of it, but some parts really annoy me. actually, now that i think about it, a lot of it irritates me. this album just lost another star."
2,Music to give you a headache,"I was reading some of these reviews and i was suprised by how people know the differences in each of these songs becasuse they all sound a like to me. This is ok background music but that is all it is. You can't even understand what this ladie is saying and the guitars are quite anoying. I know how Mr. shields spend all the money he got from making this cd he bought some drugs with it becasue you have to be high to like this headache indussing racket. This cd has something in common with Lost in Translation for which he did a couple of songs for, they are both overrated and boring."
1,"Short, blunt and honest : misled by the critics","First, I tried to distinguish the so called ""amazing"" guitar from the horrible noise. Then, made an effort to enjoy altogether, but after a couple of attempts I quit and see no reason for this record to be so acclaimed."
1,All Hype,"I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that ""...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.."" Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser.It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) ."
1,STUPID CRAP FROM THE BORING DUMB EARLY 90s,This music is so stupid and weird not in a good unique way but just an uncomfortable way like when you are at someone's house and you don't like them and want to go home but you can't and you probably have to spend the night in their living room....really really crappy don't do this to yourself forget this crap and this stupid type of music
1,Garbage!,A classic album with a fat lie advertising as being remastered . This is the same cd as the original. Rip-off.
5,Amazing,"All i can say is wow, this cd is great. i just picked it up recently after reading the outstanding reviews it recieved. This cd has such a unique sound, the way they blend the vocals with the guitar gives the cd such a smooth feeling. i do admit it takes a little while to get used to the sound, but after a few listens you won't be able to stop listening. GO PICK THIS CD UP! it's a classic."
3,"""Loveless"" I'm missing something here","When I first bought this album I was expecting to hear lush melodies and beautiful noises. Instead, for the most part, I got noises. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some truly terrifc tracks on here, but for the rest, (for me at least), it's not much more than over-experimented music, but hey, some people dig that. But as for Kevin and his guitar work, it is impressive. ""Loveless"" is way overhyped, I prefer Slowdive, but still, My Bloody Valentine is worth a listen."
5,Simply the best album ever.,"Can't just fully explain how i adore this album. Every song is amazing, sound meets noise and the result is an unique masterpiece!Sometimes you have the feeling that Kevin Shield's guitar sounds like an helicopter floating just feets over your head but still the music is so soft and touchy!Is it insane listening 1/2 times a day the very same album during the last 7 years? Well that's what I do, it's my drug! Best album ever made. 5 out of 5!"
5,Still great after all these years...a classic that still sends chills up the spine.,"I bought this album when it first came out, and was blown away by it. Brian Eno once claimed regarding this album "" the future of music"" or something along those lines. I still listen to this album from time to time after all these years, and it still send chills up my spine...Ethereal, other worldly and just plain beyond the use of words to describe. Buy it, listen to it, and get carried away and enveloped in a swirl of sound and aural delight."
5,A moving masterpiece of guitar feedback dripping with chaos,This album changed my life and the way that I listen to music. The production is amazing with guitar and vocal lines weaving in and out of songs. The album seems like one long song because many of the songs mold in eachother. This album is an amazing record and it gets better after every listen. Recommended for anyone who is looking for a musical journey through the world of mind and sound!!!!!!!
4,"Pretty good, but it takes a bit of getting used to.","I bought this album after hearing the 'Glider EP' as this is generally regarded as being the best MBV LP. When i first put it on, only a couple of tracks stood out - but i think thats the whole point. This is good music to have on before you go to sleep (i don't mean that in a bad way) but it's kinda chilled out. It's quite sonic youth-y in the way that it's got lots of swirly layers of guitar, but it's also got some good tunes like 'Only Shallow' and 'Soon'. You have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate this though."
3,Excuse me?,"I can't for the life of me understand why the critics wet their pants over this album. It certainly hasn't weathered the storm of the decade as well as similarly produced albums (i.e. Curve, Lush, Slowdive), but I think too many people bought the hype and still haven't realized what they paid for. Not worth more than three stars. For a REAL 5 star album, check out 'Souvlaki,' 'Pubic Fruit,' or even 'Ladies and Gentlemen we are Floating Through Space'"
3,I'm unmoved,"Seeing as how it's often mentioned in the same breath as many other 90's classics, I planned on a good experience with this record. Maybe you have to like shoegazer rock, but I thought that the best albums of a decade didn't need such genre confines. After the wonderfully warped opening riff on the first song, nothing all that compelling happens. Is that the point? Am I supposed to find depth in songs that don't really do anything? As a production it's great (save the 80s-remnant drum sound), but as music its lack of dynamics hurts a lot."
4,"Extremely Interesting, but.......","No doubt this is a classic record for the level of experimentation and its very unique soundscape..dreamy vocals supplemented by crashing guitars and weird speed-variation sound effects. Loveless has doubtless influenced a whole generation of shoegazers. But as a piece of music, it tends to fall a bit flat. Most of the really good melodies are marred by the speed tricks. Ah but then, if it wasn't for that this wouldn't be a landmark record, would it? Buy it if you're really into experimental avant-garde stuff.. but I doubt you'll be listening to it too often"
5,MBV: Loveless,"Simply the greatest album of all time!The album/band that inspired an entire generation/genre of UK indie music of the early 90's. ""Shoegazing"" the (unfortunately) very short lived UK phenomenon owes everything to MBV.Neigh on 49 mins of absolute bliss. A CD I could listen to every hour of every day until I I'm burnt in a wooden box....Give me Loveless or give me death!"
1,BEWARE! THIS IS NOT A REMASTERED VERSION OF LOVELESS,"Buyers beware. Although I think MBV's Loveless is a perfect album in every way, I bought this version because it was specified as a REMASTERED version, which it is most definitely NOT. I listened to my old copy of Loveless on CD and I listened to this newer supposedly remastered copy back to back. There is no difference except for the price tag. Unless you want to pay 30 bucks for a second copy of Loveless with no bonus tracks and one that isn't remasterd I'd suggest you stay away. The only difference here is that there is an extra booklet, but it is entirely in Korean and there is a slipcover for the CD jewelcase. As a huge My Bloody Valentine fan, I was completely disappointed that I wasted my money purchasing another copy of the record with nothing of extra value. I'd give an arm and a leg for a real remastered copy of Loveless. This isn't it."
5,"""Loveless"" is as rich of an alternative music album as is, in some way, an electronic album too","""One very rich analogue album that manages to appeal to the eyes and ears with its distinctive 'shoegaze' sound, scratchy guitar almost synthesiser-like rhythms, and the ethereal, trippy nature of its album cover and music makes for the best. Boards of Canada, being a familiar band, once quoted from Pitchfork saying this was one of the albums they were inspired in formulating their acoustic-influenced album, The Campfire Headphase, in creating a mesmerising and unnerving sound that was similar to the songs here on Loveless like Touched, To Here Knows When, and What You Want. Shields and Butcher have made what is an inspiring yet somewhat overrated piece of rough-on-the-hands art that is as fine as an album from the people of the electronica field they've inspired and that also includes Seefeel and Ulrich Schnauss."""
4,Unique in 1991 and still relevant today!,The sound of this album transforms space and time. If you appreciate this music you will never forget the first time you hear this unique creation.If it doesn't resonate with you look deep into your soul to understand what limits you have placed on yourself.
5,Beautiful,"I love this CD. It's like every emotion in the world is conveyed through this music. It's a great CD to put on when you feel like everything is crashing in on you, when the world is falling apart. Beautiful."
5,ya ya ya,there are bands you'll never outgrow and get sick of and my bloody valentine is one of them. What might seem like messed up sound mish-mash to some (first-time) listeners actually totally makes sense and becomes more and more beautiful with increasing listening frequency. Fortunately never been reached by other bands they stay very unique and special. To me the album 'sometime later' by Alpha is the updated not ripped-off end-90's version of equally melancholic beautiful music.
5,The best album ever?,"Is this the best album ever made?I'm not sure about that... but i am sure that its up there with the likes of The Stone Roses, Pet Sounds and White Album.It is without doubt my fave record ever... even beating The Stone Roses debut album. Whats more i still have my Loveless tour t-shirt :-)Why Kevin Shields and Belinda Butcher never released a follow-up is a complete mystery to me. It may still happen though...Personal fave of mine on the album is Only Shallow.If you like this album you will love ""You made me realise""... a fantastic tune."
5,"Beyond life, beyond time...","I saw them when the record came out: overcrowded lousy room, volume way too loud. This didn't diminish one bit the reverence I feel towards this band. Words fail to convey the experience. This music will STAY.To those who don't get it, I recommend good headphones or stereo, LOUD. Forget your little self for a moment, take a deeeep breath, stop thinking, press ""Play""."
5,We all know how excellent this album is......,So I just put out a faint plea being it's near Christmas and all...... Kevin Shields your fans miss your talents and feel you should put out your own music not star on the albums of others..... Well it's just my opinion that all...
4,beloved,"This album keeps coming back to me. I'm haunted by my love for this music. I pick it up every couple of years and play it out until I've had my fill and can put it away again. The last time I brought this out it was because I couldn't get Bob Mould's ""Favorite Thing"" out of my head. I didn't even know that Kevin worked with Mould on that song, I just sort of felt the connection and I had to get them both out and play the hell out of them. Loveless is chock full of great songs that will live with you forever. Listen and enjoy.One last thing, be sure to listen to the music when watching 'Lost in Translation.'"
3,"Great album, just not for everyone.","No one is going to love this album the first time they hear it. You will fall into one of two categories when first hear it. You will either say ""That's weird, but kind of cool."" or "" I'm going to turn this off now."" It takes time to like and I can't really blame anyone for not liking it. The songs are very distorted and fuzzy and the vocals are tuned low into the mix, making the lyrics almost impossible to decipher. It is not something you will love right off the bat, but it will grow on you once you listen a few times. My favorite track is ""When You Sleep"" because it is the closest thing to catchy this album could ever get. I Would recommend The Jesus and Mary Chain's PsychoCandy and if you like that, you could definitely learn to love this."
2,OK..,"I naturally thought I would appreciate this album after a few listens, as so many reviews have stated it is a musical masterpiece. Well having owned it for a few weeks now, I can tell you it just aint. Many of the melodies are rather boring, and just meander about without actually going anywhere.I am giving this album 2 stars for 2 reasons: The songs 'Only Shallow' and 'Blown A Wish'. These songs are actually very good and I would suggest that you download these and not buy the whole album, you will be dissappointed with the other songs"
2,not my kind of music.....,"I listened to this cd, expecting it to be one kind of music when it was actually another. This is alot of sounds put together to make music??? Maybe it's because i am listening to this cd now, and i don't really realize it's full influence on music since i didn't own this cd when it came out. Make sure you listen to samples before you buy. Me, I didn't buy, i downloaded the cd."
2,Below Average,"You'd be better off with Sonic Youth or Dinosaur Jr. Still warrents 2 stars because of the time period. It is like over produced, studio-tized punk. Like the idea, but can't get into it."
3,"been done, been heard...","Please, please, let's not kid ourselves, there is nothing new or revolutionary in this album ; there is clearly the influence of Sonic youth or Joy division in it and just because Bilinda Butcher has an interesting voice, this does not just justify the praise I have been reading about this band.It's good stuff but it's not outstanding.Where were most of the reviewers in the 80's ??? Not born I guess."
2,Vastly Overrated,"The enormously gifted guitarist Robin Guthrie, formerly of Cocteau Twins, boasts one of the most impressive private studios of equipment. He once joked with a reporter that Mr. Shields of MBV had some widgets that he'd like to own, and that he had some stuff that Mr. Shields would like.But the similarity ends there. Notwithstanding the obscene expense to produce Loveless, the recording fails to impress. Mr. Shields does little more than drone on with monotonous chording. There's no arpeggio work here, no compelling technique, texture or tone. And the breathy vocals are impossible to discern in the poor mix.Don't buy into the hype. Invest wisely; buy a Cocteau Twins or Mazzy Star recording for something similar but far, far better."
1,waste of any time,"It was like watching someone's home movies. Waste of time and money.Strongly would not recommend this, again waste of time."
5,Kallmaker is at the TOP of her game with this one!,"Wow! I just read Finders Keepers while on vacation, and honestly it's one of Karin's top 3. Not only that, it's one of the best reads you will find in lesbian romance. It has everything and more. Passion, romance, humor and intellectual substance all rolled up in one fine little novel. There is a truly thought provoking story line about body image that resonates with both characters yet each in a very unique way. On top of it, the romance aspect of the story line really grabs your attention and won't let you go! You really have no idea how things turn out until the end and I love the element of surprise. Then on top of it all is Kallmaker's well timed and tasteful interjection of humor throughout the novel that really adds to the pure enjoyment of reading this fine piece of work. It will make you think, laugh, sweat and leave you wanting more. I highly, highly recommend this book. Bravo Karin Kallmaker!"
5,Harley Davidson Ceramic Mug Shot Set,"I ordered these for my husband for Christmas. They are a very nice set, and I received them in a timely manner."
5,Our favorite Harold Book,"This is our favorite Harold book. When my son asks for Harold, this story is usually the one he's thinking of. And there's some humor for the parent as well, which I appreciate."
4,"Fun, but maybe scary for some","My 3yo son loves this book, but on occasion is pretty spooked by the ""thing"" in the flying saucer."
1,Terrible quality book!,"I'm not sure if this is for the individual book or for Amazon, as I don't know who manufactures the actual books.I bought this for my 3-year-old because Harold and the Purple Crayon is his favorite book (and one of mine too). The story is OK, though not nearly as clever as the original. However, the first time I opened the book, the cover came completely unglued. Because the soft-cover is stiffer than the pages, it made it very difficult to read, and it obviously would not stand up to the abuse my son delivers.I returned the book for a replacement, which Amazon makes very easy. Unfortunately, the replacement has the same issue. While it did not come completely unglued, the cover did start to separate during the first (and only) reading.As Amazon started by selling books, I expected much higher quality products from them. This is my first bad review of an Amazon product, and it's ironic that it is for a book."
2,Not as good as the orginal,"I LOVE the original Harold and the Purple Crayon, but this did not live up to it's predecessor. The illustrations are good and what you would expect, but the story is weak and uninspired. I haven't given up on Harold, though! I will try another Purple Crayon book soon."
2,"Wetzel's ""Candlewick-The Jewel of Imperial""","This book lists Candlewick items by number. If you are looking for identification help, this is not the place to be. No pictures, and no help on sizes relating to the titles of the pieces. Some confusing titles; ie., ""trays"" and ""relish"" are headings for relish trays. I have had little success in finding an item for which I didn't know the name, as in any number of plates! And I have a covered butter, and I can't find any help with what it is worth because the book doesn't describe what I have. I'd like a description including size!"
5,Candlewick:The Jewel of Imperial (BookII),The book was exactly what I was looking for and in the condition that it was advertised. The book has drawings and excellent descriptions of the crystal. In the back of the book it has the drawings of the pictures that were in the original booklet when the crystal first became available. Now I am able to know the name of each piece of crystal. This is by far the best book on Candlewick.Candlewick : The Jewel of Imperial (Book II)
5,It's Chuck who put the candle in 'candlewick!',It's simply the best! Better than all the rest! Candlewick mom and pa know their stuff.
5,[....],"Ludacris represented with this one. I love this cd its off the chains. Good beats, original Lyrics, everything needed to make a cd great."
4,Good debut,"there are some great songs and some terrible songs from Ludacris but overall it is pretty good. there are some songs like ""Whats your fantasy"" and ""Southern Hospitality"". It has great production from Chaka Zulu. Ludacris isn't a great lyricist but knows some good comedy."
4,King of the south!,"Being one of my favorite artists in the game today, i have to say that Luda is at his best with his debut album. Full of amusing lyrics and his unique rhyme style, he puts together an album with outstanding songs. Listen to hsi freestyle 'mouthing off'. He is one of the best freestylers out there. Basically if your a fan of Ludacris or southern rap then this is a must have album. 4.5/5Top 5:Stick 'Em UpPhat RabbitSouthern HospitalityHoU Got A Problem"
4,not as good as its follow up,Ludacris is a great rapper and this is a great cd but if you listened to his second cd you will think that this is not as good its a great rap cd but against the second any rapper would have a problem topping it
4,not bad,"not bad but the lyrics need more creativity, how many ho songs wil rappers make, on the fantasy remix trina, foxy, and shawna outshine luda on his own track."
5,Off tha chain CD,"Ludacris has begun with a big southern Bang! Throw in tight rhymes, a dash of creativity, n great beats, n u have ""Back for the first time."" All through the CD u'll hear great sounds n mind blowing lyrics. My favorites r ""U got a Problem?"", ""1st & 10"", ""Mouthing Off""(my favorite), ""Ho"", ""Whats ur fantasy remix"" and ""Stick 'em up"". Get this CD cause u'll wonder why u haven't sooner."
3,4 out of sixteen!,"I thought this album was going to be sweet because the two video's and the first two songs on the album. Thats it. Except for track 11 (YOUS A HO) the rest of the songs are really weak. I like about 3 of 4 songs on the album. The album is funny, dont get me wroung but you have to fast forward a lot."
2,Whack Album,"This is such a horrible album, how in the world does anyone like it? It got 3 hot tracks. Southern Hospitality, What's Your Fantasy, and its remix. Anyone who likes this album doesn't know rap"
2,Back for the last time hopefully.......,"Why do people listen to music that dicriminates so much this entire album is about discrimination against females he even has an entire song labled ""Ho"" which just talks about sleeping with women and calling them..., talking about single mothers is what really made me mad because my sister is a is a single mother but that doesnt make her a ... THIS CD IS FOR MALE ... THE LYRICS ARE DUMB AND OFFENSIVE ESPECIALLY TO A YOUNG BLACK FEMALE LIKE MYSELF!."
2,"Unoriginal, untalented, and an embarrassment to 'hip hop'","What a shame it is to see the legacy of hip hop destroyed by many of these modern-day 'emcees' and producers such as Ludacris and fellow associates. This album delivers no message whatsoever: it has no meaning. It consists of sell-out beats and lyrics constructed off the top-of-the-head - the rhymes tell us more about vague sexual positions and platinum jewellary than they do Ludacris' (limited) personality, thoughts and views. This album is sure to be a chart-topper and over the next 6 months or so the majority of its tracks will be played-out by MTV, Kiss etc. But this album still won't be a success. In my opinion, more of a tradgedy. I guess there's jus something about that dirty-south..."
5,Ludacris' debut still fresh after all these years,"Still throw this into my cd changer once in a while and the music still feels great as it did when the cd first released. Ludacris has evolved as a muscician and as a celebrity over time, it's been great to see him blossom into a classy musician, instead of your standard run-of-the-mill rappers who don't get it."
3,ludacris! love the name! He also got game!,ludacris is one of the biggest rappers in the industry which gives him his bragging rights. his voice is very recognizable. his flow is great the lyrics...hmmmm the lyrics....well the lyrics are...ok i guess too much sex its a great cd for about 2 or 3 days in your cd player and then you set it down and forget about it. im giving it 3 stars for the three days it was in my cd player and for his flow! he got a really nice flow! its a decent cd...if you like his new cd red light district..youll like this
2,2-PAC WAY BETTA!!!!!!,First off this album [is bad]' 2nd Ludacris has no lyrics they all sound the same the last word he says is always spoken louder then the others and they are all about the same thing SEX SEX SEX he's more like a horney teenager then a rapper. The last a final thing I'm gonna say is that for all we know Ludacris is still is a virgin.
2,Ludicrous is how to spell it!,"Ok, this cd was ok, but i think it could be better. Anyway, these rap guys took our band name! Our name was Ludicorus, and now you took it, and didnt even spell it right. we want our name back! cuz we had it first. remember, PUNK RAWK rules."
5,Incognegro with/ Bonus tracks,"All this album is, is his first album INCOGNEGRO with some extra songs. But it is still one of the best albums from the Dirty South!!! I love the song he did with Pastor Troy although is was a little short. I think this album did a lot to help introduce the world to Pastor Troy. B/C Ludacris made it big first so then other people heard that song and more than likely wanted to know who he was. But Troy has been hot and puttin it down here in GA for years. If you like Ludacris or Down South music... this is an instant classic and a must have for you. Every song on here is hot and the skits are funny.NEW SONGS: Stick Em up feat UGK, Southern Hospitality, Phat Rabbit, and Whats Your Fantasy REMIX feat Trina, and Foxy Brown"
4,Great start,"Awesome CD and its a great start. To me not his strongest but hey, its his first CD. The CD progresses perfectly and shows him to be strong lyrically and bringing the heat and also the ho's.Ludacris is big into the ho's. Over time he has let the whole Ho thing slowly fade away. I think thats a plus because it shows him to be a respectable artists instead of putting down women. Especially with his new cd where he brings props to women and his Mom.If you wanna grab this I suggest it because you can see where Ludacris came from. He has gotten more creative beats and gotten better at being...well just Luda."
3,Skills but not to pay the bills,"I am a huge UNDERGROUND hip hop fan and this trendy rap stuff isnt my thing but after hearing the bangin' southern hospitality and Whats your fantasy i thought id burn it and give it a shot. Although i dont regret using a $1.00 cd i would not recommend this cd to any true hip hop fans. The boy has skill out the roof and is hilarious but he doesnt deliver all the goods on ""back for the first time""."
5,Works fine at a ridiculously low price,"I was a little worried because some people reported problems, but I have not had any. It's so cheap, you could buy two or three and still pay only a third of the name replacement brand, that would be playing the odds, and if they all work you'd have plenty of backup power!"
4,the picture not its,This battery works just fine in my camera as advertised. Just like the OEM part. I just hope it last as long as the OEM battery did 5 years. Well worth the price. but pictures no same
5,battery pack,"Received this impossible to find, battery pack. Came quickly and inperfectly new condition. Great deal!"
5,Amazing,"The burst of power that I get from this is amazing. It lasts for about an hour, and allows for extremely impressive workouts. I don't take it everyday, but only before i have time for a solid workout, and it never fails to deliver!"
4,"Most fast, effective stuff ever - maybe TOO much so...","I'm amazed at how well this stuff works. In fact, I only need 1/2 a capsule before bike riding, otherwise sometimes my heart feels like it'll fly out between my ribcage! I read somewhere there was caffeine in this - disguised by a chemical name. I'm not sure, but it seems much more intense than any cup o joe, that's for sure!"
5,Genius in resonance,"What's better than a great sounding John Coltrane live recording? A great sounding John Coltrane live album with kindred spirit Eric Dolphy. These two brilliant young masters tear it up on this fine recording, although listening to it now in 2000 it's hard to hear what got the critics so up in arms in 1961. I've often thought that if I wanted to recommend a single Coltrane CD to someone unfamiliar with the man's work, it would be this one. Here we catch his style in one of its many transitions, no doubt inspired by Dolphy's own ingenious playing."
5,The right Vanguard,"John Coltrane / Live At The Village Vanguard - The Master Takes:Adding two tracks to the original LP, this is a very fine Live CD. Impressive innovation without ever leaving the audience behind, this is an example of Coltrane at his best.Personnel (=/-):John Coltrane - soprano saxEric Dolphy - bass clarinetMcCoy Tyner - pianoReggie Workman - bassElvin Jones - DrumsThis is a Five Star album"
4,great video quality! but randomly jumps scenes if you die,"I was so excited to hear there was a high definition version of Dragon's Lair. It looks fabulous. I don't remember the laser disc video quality much anymore. The video does look date but sharp. If there's a defect, it's somewhat grainy. But again, we're looking at 80s video.I remember the gameplay more and this hd-dvd has serious branching issues. I know it's because of the way the designers structured it, but if you die, it randomly jumps to a different scene. the original game was basically trial and error like learning simon says. but this one jumps so randomly that you can't memorize the moves like in the original. the original was like building a story. you mess up, try a different move until you get it right, move on to the next scene and repeat. this one, you're constantly jumping so you can't memorize it properly.that said, it's still work owning just for the fact that it looks so goo."
5,dragons lair oh my,As far back as i can remember the game jumped randomly from scene to scene that was part of the game. The hd version is awesome. I had a couple of small glitches but nothing major.Brings back a lot of memories .Enjoyed creator commentary and view mode.I highly recommend.
5,ok Guzel!!!,"I think this is one of his best cd's. I love listening to it on long trips in the car. My husband (who is Turkish) introduced me to Tarkan. I love Tarkan's music and all Turkish music. Here are some recommendations for other great Turkish singers: Metin Senturk, Mustafa Sandal, Ibrahim Tatlises,Zerryn Ozer, and Sezen Aksu."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this bag for my best friend for Christmas 2007 and was very disappointed when I received it. It wasn't what I expected at all. It looked nothing like the pictures. I actually had to go out and get my friend another Christmas gift because I felt there was no way that I could give her this bag. I gave it to her anyway with the other two gifts that I gave her. She says that she liked this bag but I think it was because she was trying to be nice because she didn't want to hurt my feelings. I really would not recommend this or buy from the manufacture again. I gave it three stars only because my friend said she liked it even though she may not have been telling the truth. My husband laughed at it when I showed it to him before I wrapped it, I hope this helps with your purchase"
4,A great album!,"One of the best albums of the past year, ""Rialto"" will grab you from the first five seconds and keep you entranced throught the end, at which point you'll decide to start from the beginning again. It's not a perfect record, but definitely worthy of your hard-earned dollars."
3,single is better value,"After seeing the epic and immensely stylish 'Monday Morning 5:19' on TV I rushed out to buy this album. I would have been better getting the single. 'Monday Morning 5:19' gets five stars easily, 'Summer's Over' and 'Untouchables' gets three, but most of the rest of the album is filler."
5,Great Melodic Black Metal,"I don't have any of Naglfar's previous albums so I can't compare this to their previous works, however just listening to this as a stand alone album I have to say this is easily one of the best black metal albums I've ever heard. Every song on here is melodic and memorable. The raw energy captured on this disc is unbelievable, and every song is intense. When I'm in the mood for black metal, I usually reach for Pariah first. If you're a fan of black metal, Naglfar, or melodic death metal, get this album. You won't be disappointed!"
4,All-star cast with a few duds,"Great collection of adult contemporary all-stars and unsung's is not without its occasional eclectic production snobberies, but comes packed with big name solidarity and undeniably solid pacing."
5,One Of The Best Ever Soundtracks,This is a must for anyone who loves music. It covers all the bases on giving to the listener a wide myriad of emotions
5,Music Of Moods,"My fiancee kept trying to play her old casette version of this soundtrack. It was so old that it kept on messing up her player. I ordered this music on CD, and the first night she received it, she could not believe the improved sound quality of the music she cherished. Listening in a new way kept her bragging about the songs all night long. Well, almost all night long.Great songs, great artist. Mood music. Try it."
4,A strong effort,"A fantastic album which has a few weaker spots, but when Pharoah's Tenor bursts out on SUN watch out!"
4,Perfect for cycling in cold weather but not one-size-fits-all,"I bought these glasses to keep cold air from blowing on my eyes while riding my bike to work in the morning. Sure they look a little funny, but not as funny as ski goggles or running into something because my eyes are watering so bad I can't see it.The foam makes a good seal and is thick enough that my eyelashes don't hit the inside of the lenses. The only problem is that the ear pieces are make for someone with an enormous head. When the lenses and foam are positioned correctly on my face, the curved part of the ear pieces is about and inch above and behind my ears. So when I hit a bump or move my head in any way, they slide down my nose and I have to push them back into place. Adjustable earpieces would be a big improvement."
5,Brilliant!,"These goggles are brilliant. Thay were given to me as a joke gift by a friend, but I actually use them frequently. The refrigeration thing only works to a limited degree and involves planning (refrigerating the onions) and fridge space.. this is important to me when I am preparing a large quantity of onions/shallots/leeks.THEY WORK!"
2,Okay but does not help,Received goggles in timely fashion but does not help as well as cheaper goggles bought at Home Depot (they cover my glasses) Seem to be well constructed but do not fit at top. I'll keep them & try them again sometimes.
4,Good Final Bridge to Generations,"I own this book. It was good but the trio of Spock, McCoy, and Kirk doing their things together as only they can do is lacking, and thats a bummer. The idea of the book was good though I think that the ending was somewhat of a let down. It was a little too easy to stop the destruction of warp drive engines. All in all it was enjoyable read, and if you're interested in Star Trek novels of the orignal series, this is a very good one to get the closure from the series that started it all."
4,"""Last Roundup"" Delivers","This is the best of the post ""Star Trek VI"" books and promises one last great adventure for Captain Kirk and his crew. This book delivers and we find Kirk, Checkov and Scotty as the main characters in a story involving Kirk's nephews and a far flung world they wish to colonise. We see the early efforts that would lead to the Federation/Klingon alliance. Even Captain Sulu and the Excelsior make an appearance in time for a confrontation that reveals betrayal and old enemies alike. Without giving too much away this novel is truly a worthy epilogue to the classic era of films. And it is with great pride that I recommend it to you all."
4,"A great story, and the reader is great!","The story here is good, but what really makes this great is the way it's read. David Kaye does the best job I've ever heard of perfectly imitating the character's voices (with the exception of Sulu - still need to work on that one). There are times when you honestly think the original crew came back together to record this adventure, and it really adds to the story. While they don't all technically get together until almost the end of the story, it's still a good one and well worth the time."
4,oh oh oh oh (wonderful),"Man did I fall in love when I first heard this sampler, I mean come on it was my first taste of Converge and all those other great bands that the once great Equal Vision had on them. Man I remember it like yesterday, I was living at my uncle's house for the summer cuase I was working out there until the fall, so I got to say in my cousin's room who then lived in the garage. So he has all these cd cases all over the place, most of them were empty, but not this one! Oh the sweetness i heard when I heard this, I had never really liked the harder bands up until then and when I heard it I knew I was ready. So that's the story of how I've gotten into the good music, some of that Hardcore music you feel me on that don't you? Anyways this is good and if your curious about some of the quality bands (not Coheed and Cambria, UGH) that Equal Vision once had to offer, well I'd say take a gander at this it will intice thee."
1,Cheap-looking and online image and description is not accurate,"This item is cheap-looking, colors are different, entire goggles are black, and it resembles a fake body organ. In fact, the color is closer to mauve and nowhere near the saddle color depicted in the online photo. In person, it is extremely cheap in it's appearance and probably should be sold at a dollar general store for $.99. Clearly, the product has been misrepresented as being far better than it actually is.Old-Fashioned Flying Helmet"
5,Wonderful Sensory Toy,This provides stimulus of sensory and tactile play. It also encourages speech and discussion. The child engages in conversation as he or she is trying to guess what they pick before they pull it out of the bag. Not for long hours of play but well worth the 10 to 15 minutes (or more) that engages them to continue. Lots of giggles.
2,meh,Not as great as I imagined. Our son went through them once and that was it he has no interest. I thought having all the pieces separate would be great; it's actually the opposite they just end up as more clutter. Would be more engaging if pieces could connect somehow?
5,NOT FOR LIBERAL SPIRITUALISTS,"I seriously doubt that reviewer ""Penelope"" has actually read this book. It's ideals, which are biblically sound and expositional, are the antithesis of the militant feminist movement. A movement which has proven to be an overwhelming failure.This excellent book includes a practical history of militant feminism and an examination of authentic womanhood according to Scripture.And, to borrow from the previous reviewer, it educated me on the lies of the the feminist movement, the most destructive lie being this:""You can have it all""No, you can't. No one can. You must choose."
5,Very Helpful!,"While we were in Paris with an organized antique tour group, this map proved invaluable, both to ourselves and even the tour director. Very concise directions from the metro stops made finding attractions a snap. I'd definately use these guides for other cities."
5,You Don't Need To Read French With A Magnifying Glass With This Specialty Map,"My visit to Paris was all the more enjoyable, because when I arrived at the Metro station for the new Branly Museum, I was clueless as to its location. I looked at Brein's Paris Guide, which specified my every step right to the entrance of the museum. This map was simply brilliant! No more wandering about Paris in a fog as to the most interesting sightseeing. Make no mistake--I got eye-strain trying to decipher the tiny free maps in French."
1,"A limited, expensive map","I bought this map along with the Paris Mapguide based upon the reviews here. It's an oversized metro map with mini-maps to 50 attractions. I never found a tourist destination that wasn't easily found from the nearest metro. You can get a free metro map when you buy a ticket or pass. Buy this only if you don't want to pull out your reading glasses to use the Paris Mapguide, but you'll still need a regular map to find the location of a restaurant or shop. Get the Paris Mapguide or the Michelin blue book instead. (To add insult to injury, there's a advertisement for the Paris Visite pass on the back, arguably the worst value for public transport in Paris.)"
5,Perfect Desk Lamp,"this desk lamp is great, the light is bright and clear and easy on the eyes. the housing and construction is of light plastic, so its not the most durable item but its light and easily movable. i would imagine if they used more sturdy materials the price would go up naturally..... for its price its super, especially with the bulbs that priced at approx 7 bucks. recommend for anyone looking for a desk lamp that is cool and clear and non-halogen. I looked into the OTT lamps but they seem overpriced and this lamp seems like the perfect balance between price and light clarity. Attach some plastic rubber bumpers available at your local drug store to the bottom to help with the non-skid bottom."
2,this product is very fragile,"Looks nice, but I have to say this product is very fragile.I just bought this last week. Then yesterday, I accidentally dropped it from the desk to the carpeted floor. And the joint part between the base and neck was instantly crashed. I was so upset and called the customer service of Panasonic this afternoon. The department gave me the phone number of their warranty department.But no matter how many times I called, all I got from the warranty department was a recorded voice which repeats ""our business hours is over, Please come back during the business hour"".I called back to the customer service and asked if the warranty department was close during summer and they said it shouldn't be. But that was the only warranty department number they had.I am so unhappy about whole incident. I don't want to buy the same product again."
4,cool lamp for the price,"I only give this four stars because this is the first fluorescent lamp I brought. The construction is in light plastic, so don't expect anything like titanium or such. at first I thought it was a little unstable when standing on the desk. But after a solid month of use, I found that was not a probelm at all. In fact, you can even turn on the lamp while in the folded position and use it as a mood light. I have it with my Dell 2001FP monitor and Logitech 3100 speakers. They match perfectly.as for reading with this lamp, it is very bright. I was looking for a reading lamp that provide this type of lighting for a long while. At this price, it is a steal. good job panasonic!"
1,Disappointing,"I can't recommend this to anyone expecting the quality of later James releases. I have their greatest hits album, Laid and Hey Ma, and like all three a lot. I suppose if you want a sense of the evolution of their style, this is interesting, but for me, I found it virtually unlistenable on first play. I don't plan on listening to it again..."
4,It's No Akira Ifukube Score,"Luckily, his Godzilla theme is in the movie and in the soundtrack. Hattori's last Godzilla score was G vs. SpaceGodzilla, which had some good parts, but wasn't that good overall. The action music was weak. While Hattori did improve his dramatic cues a lot, the action music is still pretty bad. Those are just a few tracks though, so I only took 1 star off. In the movie, it'll be drowned out by the explosions and roars so I doubt it'll hurt the movie. Also, there are some very good sound effects of the monsters and UFO in the movie. So overall, I liked the score because of the very good drama music, but not the action music."
1,NOT RED,"I am so bummed, this item is not red. It is a beautiful orange shade, but there is not even a hint of red. If my main bedroom color was brown I would have loved this duvet, it feels so soft; however, it is no where in the red family so it just will not work."
3,Looks and feels great but very thin,"At 19.99 this is a decent deal but I would not pay any more for it. It was easy to use and fit my comforter well, however the material is very thin. The front of the duvet and shams are a very thin microfiber and the back is polyester. It looks great but I fear it will fall apart should I try to wash it. I think the 120$ price tag is in someone's imagination had I paid that much for this it would be going back. If you need a duvet for cheap it's ok but if you have the money I would buy something a little sturdier."
1,SO NOT RED,I was also disappointed - I think there was a typo somewhere because now when I look it up it shows sienna was the color I thought I was seeing...
3,Useful but truncated,"The proposed topic for this book could potentially fill volumes... if you're willing to put in the work. What has been compiled, it seems, is only a brief smattering of fight scenes and scenes that could be interpretted as fight scenes. I appreciate the attention given to gender mixing and classical vs. contemporary plays, but the end result is only a handful of useful works, a handful of interesting works, and several that make the reader just why the author bothered with them.I'm glad it exists, I'm glad I own it, but this is certainly not a ""definitive"" collection. I wait patiently for a more comprehensive collection."
2,Hardly as extensive as one would hope,"I was looking for a good resource to find fight scenes, and after a quick internet search this was the first book to come up. When I found a hard copy my first impression was how light and thin the book was, and this was the first warning that this book wasn't going to be nearly as in-depth as I expected. So I opened it up and looked at the contents, and I was right. For a book that claims to have scenes from classical to contemporary, it seems to have a lot of classical with one or two contemporary plays mixed in.The whole book seems to have a very reserved element about it, as if it's reluctant to expose the reader to violence. Not recommended for the serious crowd, but it probably works as a ""my first fight scene"" book."
4,Very Good,My son loves these books and this is just like the rest of the Berestain Bears. Its about the Dad giving safety instructions but in a funny way (he makes all the mistakes he's not supposed to).
5,"Parachute ""Bible""","As an aerodynamicist working on the NASA Orion Project (Space Shuttle replacement), I have found that Knacke is considered to be the ""Bible"" of parachute design, acknowledged by NASA engineers and industrial contractor engineers at multiple companies. This is the first book to purchase for anyone interested in the design and testing of parachute systems, especially considering its extensive provision of empirical data."
1,Truth in advertising,I don't normally write reviews. I purchased this on the strength of the on-line reviews. The title says it all...
2,Only four episodes?,"Watched this as a kid and loved it; all my favorite HB characters together in one show. Don't understand why they are releasing only 4 episodes (and for $11-$15? For only four shows?) and not a whole season. Based on that, ""this specific product"" only gets a two. Let me know when a whole season is released (and at a more reasonable cost); then maybe i'll spend my money on it..."
5,awesome,"I love this dvd. If you have the spooky games and laff-a-lympics dvd,still get this. Why, because 2 out of 4 episodes aren't on that incredibly large laff-a-lympics dvd. They are Apaluco and England, and Florida."
3,Good kid fun!,It's great to have a fun video that doesnt' cost a lot but has a lot to offer. This Scooby is it!
2,Poor construction,"This item performs it's duty as a gate opener, however it is poorly constructed. It must be opened before use to set the necessary code internally. It was extremely difficult to open and once open even more difficult to close. In spite of the great care in opening it, because it is only plastic, the guides and snaps were damaged. These guides and snaps had to be manipulated to allow the device to be closed once again. My concern is that when the batteries have to be changed and the device has to be opened again that it will not reseal again."
4,Multi-Code 2-Channel Transmitter works as expected.,"The Transmitter is pretty easy to program to match your existing garage or gate opener. The cover is a little hard to get off w/o dinging up the plastic, but once you see the locking tabs on each side, it's not too difficult to get the cover off. Replacing the cover is a snap.Purchased 2 transmitters from ASPDOORS & A WHOLE LOT MORE and the first shipment was lost in the mail. They promptly sent out a new shipment so I have no problems with their service."
5,Very clean cut from Yoshi's in S.F.,"I personally enjoyed many of the songs on this CD. Especially 'Cheverolet' and 'Tired of Talkin'. If you like this you should try an earlier CD entitled: ""Firecracker."""
2,60 minutes?! More like 30!,My children really love Veggie Tales so when I saw this on DVD I thought they would enjoy it - and they do. The story line is great and I have no problem with that. Neither am I bothered by the new cartoon animation instead of the computerized look (although I do prefer the old style). What bothers me is that I checked the reverse of this DVD to see how long the show would run and it quotes 60 mins. So I paid a pretty penny to get this on DVD and got home to discover that the cartoon lasts for all of 30 minutes at a push - and that includes the bonus short! I am not happy about that one bit. I would not have paid the extra to get this on DVD if I had known it was a mere half an hour.
2,Larryboy - the Angry Eyebrows,We have every Veggie Tales video available. Why try to fix what isn't broken? The format on the videos are great and something all the kids can relate to. Creators: Please rethink this move.
1,"what a ""little"" idea","it was painful to watch this. my thoughts were, how did they spend more than a dollar on this ""little"" idea. i guess when you have the sucess that bid idea has had, it can be easy to lose touch with reality. this show seemed like nothing more than a poor attempt at ""copying"" other shows and that all too fatal trap of ""brand extension"", which is fine, if the product is good.I was very disappointed and could not even get one of my veggie lovin' kids to sit through this. how sad.a waste of money and time in our families opinion!"
2,I personally miss the old Larryboy,"Many will appreciate the new animation for the VHS, but I personally love the old style. We own all the videos and know all the Veggie Tale songs. I personally believe this video is terrible. My 15 month loves the other videos and always sits still to watch them. About 15 minutes into this one, he got up and requested to watch a different one. I consider that significant in itself. Other than the animation, the story is decent with the usual cast of characters. I just wish they would not have messed with the animation...it was unique and not a rehash of what has been done before.Thanks"
2,At least the new theme song is cool!,"The cartoon is not what we were hoping for. I was disappointedalso to hear that Alfred in the Larry Boy Rumor Weed is now using his regualr name of Archibald. What happened to the musical numbers? Why change what works so well? At least the new theme song rocks. ""What the world needs now is a hero"" is a great tune. I agree that the fly cartoon added on is totally unneccessary."
3,A Different Larryboy,"The faces are different as is the type of animation. My son, who is a huge Larryboy fan, didn't like the ""new"" Larry. I also think this video lacks some of the wholesome emphasis of the other Larryboy and Veggie Tales."
2,Not the Larry Boy I remember,"Okay, so I've only met Larry Boy twice before. Still, I know what I saw in the latest 'angry eyebrows' is not the work of a Christian superhero. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would not have known that this video was Christian. There are no scripture references, little reference to God, and worse, there was a lot of inappropriate stuff for children whose innocense should be protected, not deflated. There were some scary scenes, bad language (I would not allow my children to call others stupid), and like I said, no mention of Jesus and His word. I don't know what happened when the production of Larry Boy videos was transferred to someone new, but it wasn't good. I miss the former Larry, the kind cucumber who did what he did because it was right with God. In other words, I am glad I watched the movie at someone else's house (who also will not be sharing it with their children), and did not waste my money on it."
1,Wondering why they ruined Larry Boy,"We have to agree with the others that are wondering what happened to the Larry Boy we had come to know from Big Idea. Our son loves VeggieTales and has them all. We prepay for each of them as soon as we find out they are coming out. We are very disappointed in this one, as well as the Leggo My Ego that just came out last month. We will NOT be purchasing anymore of the Larry Boy shows after this. We are hoping that Phil and Mike will see that this was a big mistake and return Larry Boy to his sweet, Christian character. Also, why did it go from 3D to 2D? We are very disappointed and would not recommend this show."
4,Good and bad changes,"Veggie Tales are great! This movie improved Larry-Boy in that he was more of a super hero type. Unfortunately, he lost his pure Batman-ness and got confused with Superman, confusing the history somewhat and possibly preventing a cucumber's visit from [the destroyed planet of a vegetable sounding faintly like] Krypton.One BIG improvement was the addition of other super heroes. Electro-melon was perfect."
4,It's growing on us.,"We are a very ""Veggie"" family, and at first we were also disappointed in this video. But we have really come to enjoy it and our 2 boys request it more than all of their other veggie videos.What needs to be understood is that Big Idea is producing these with the specific intention of putting them on regular TV and give Christian families an alternative to Spongbob, Rugrats, etc. This is a new venue for them, and it is something that we really need to encourage!We also hope to see new videos comparable to their older 3D ones (or the WONDERFUL Jonah movie) very soon. Til then, ""what the world needs now is a hero""!!"
5,Usual great story from Veggie Tales,"As always, a great story with a good message for kids. The adults enjoy it too!"
2,One Piece - Not A Fan,I've purchased a pair of goggles in the past that was a one piece system. I'm not a big fan of them as there is no flexibility. I'll take old school. I failed to realize the goggles were women's goggles.
4,Fun to read,"I bought one for my sister]-in-law, I started looking through it and could not put it down so I bought another NEW one for her."
3,Overpriced,"This was, I thought, a great concept for a book. I still think that, but the quality does not justify the price.I believe I counted 35 sets of photos and the price is $34.99. Do the math. Not only that, but I assumed from seeing the price that this was a hardback book. It's not. I was quite surprised. If it had been hardback, it could have made up for some of the cost to the consumer.I consider myself a Civil War buff, so the narratives didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. They work better if you just have a casual interest in the Civil War.This was a hard book to review because the price has to be a consideration. You can purchase two of Thunder Press' Then and Now books, which I consider better anyway, for about the exact same price as this one. (And their books contain over 140 pages.)If I could go back in time, and I saw this book in a bookstore, I probably would not pay over $15.00 for it. Hopefully the price will drop for all concerned."
3,This is a $28 little book that is only 78 pages long!,"I was shocked that this book was the size of a small magazine! The spine is about 1/4 inch thick. The 40, or so photos are full-page, full color and very well done, using a photoshop technique where they layer the old photo over the newer on a adjust the transparancy so that you can see through it. I fully recognize that this was painstakingly researched and beautifully photographed, and I believe it will provide me a very interesting 20 minutes of reading, but this book is grossly overpriced at $27.99. If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have definitely picked it up and glanced through it, but there is no way I would have paid $27.99 for it. If the book had been 200 pages long, what I expected, I would have rated it 5 star due to the quality, but I feel $28 is an expensive paperback even for an averaged size, but a redicules price for a magazine."
2,A Little Disappointed,"The book arrived today. The information in the book is great, however; the price for what you get is really disappointing. I would recommend other books with A LOT more information for the same price and even cheaper. Don't make the mistake I did."
5,Ghosts of the Field: America's Most Hallowed Grounds Yesterday and Today,"The book is better than advertised. The photography is exceptional and it bring reality to the original photo's and stirs the imagination. Book arrived in advertised condition, and in a timely manner."
2,Not his best,"This is one of his earliest, and it kinda let me down. A guy working in an insane asylum. Kinda haunting at times, not terribly interesting though. It sounds as if Sekulowski is supposed to be saying some really neat stuff, but it all sounds like a bunch of fluff to me. Not the greatest, but it's Lem."
4,Good idea though an odd design,"Each time the lights go out due to a momentary surge in theline, I smile to see this Panasonic spring into action.The included wall-mount bracket proved to be an extremelyawkward configuration, so I chose to place the unit on a bookshelf opposite my bed. This location serves to camouflagethe side-mount power source/switch/pilot light, and also assures me that my bedroom won't be in darkness during an outage. And the front-facing fluorescent bulb isn't an eyesore on the shelf.The unit can then be used as a portable, stand-alone source inany area of need.I have set it to come on automatically whenever there's aninterruption of power. And it has not ever failed in thesepast 4 months."
2,Not Sure Yet,Some song on the download skipped. I'm not sure of the problem right now and would like to rewrite another review after I see if it's my fault or the product.
5,RIP [Thug In Peace] Top Dog. Quik & homiez WILL MISS U 4EVA!,"At age 21, such a short, very short life wit so much passion 4 rappin; gettin gang bang by so-called [cowards] 4 nuthin iz so sad & at tha same time make me mad; makes me wanna do sumthin since im so close wit my nig Q dat makes me wanna pray evryday 4 peace in not only in CPT but tha entire world!Hearing Quik's tribute song '50 Wayz' on his latest album makes me think hard & realize how close he WAS 2 becomin roommates. u can definetly feel his pain of how much luv he had 4 him. i can go on&on till u no...if u have eva lost sum1 its pretty much jus lyke dat. 1luv&peaceout"
3,Pretty Good Set,"Mausberg together with DJ Quik&Crew brought some Jams here.I ahve heard Mausberg's tracks with Quik from His Past few Albums&was looking too getting this set.the Production&Mausberg's flow fit like a glove.I don't think Mausberg got too His peak&I felt He was headed into that territory but sadly His time was cut short.still we have His work too remember.Mausberg really stood on for me on Quik's song ""Well"" from ""Balance&Options""."
1,NOT for Zire 71,"I bought the Zire 71 through Amazon and wanted to get protection for the screen. This page popped up and I bought the protectors but they are too small for the Zire 71 screen. Also the quality is not great, leaves marks and bubbles. I had to use to protectors and cut them up but it's not worth the purchase."
2,needs improvement,"There are several problems with these cards:1) as you may know vowels are omitted in written Arabic. As a result, if you want to learn a new word in Arabic you need diactrics - the special extra signs used to indicate the vowels. An english transliteration as in Wehr's dictionary will also do. Unfortunately, this card set provides neither. It is like writing down ""BY"" and expecting someone to understand that this is to mean ""bye"" and not ""buy"" or ""bay"" or ""boy"" or ...2) It is NOT enough to give a word as it is! If the word is a noun you have to give its plural. If it is a verb then you need to tell what the present tense is.3) the choice of words is not good.This card set is virtually useless for students of Arabic. Although, you may find it useful if you are an Arab trying to learn English!"
4,Worth it,"I zipped through this book in less than two days. It includes a description and history of the chick lit genre, advice on getting published, a list of publishers and agents that accept Chick Lit (although I would recommend checking their Web sites to make sure the information is still current), and samples including a query letter, a synopsis, and a chapter outline.I think the most useful information is in the section on how to write a chick lit novel. It covers character, plot, setting, voice, point of view, structure, outlining vs free-form writing, and revisions.Yardley gives a lot of good advice, and she refers to published novels to back up her points. SEE JANE WRITE is another popular book for how to write chick lit, but after reading it, I recommend this book instead.The reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because I haven't yet used Yardley's advice so I can't vouch for its information from my own experience."
4,Helpful Primer,"This book is a great intro to the genre, outlining the history briefly while pushing writers into new and different directions. If you are interested in chick lit as a genre, this will help shape your understanding some of the thematic elements into play. I would check out this book."
3,Nothing terribly new here.,"Cathy Yardley, Will Write for Shoes: How to Write a Chick Lit Novel (St. Martin's, 2006)I suppose it was a lost cause to consider that a how-to-write book that focused on chick lit novels would have substantially different information on the actual how-to-write bit than your average how-to-write book. The bulk of it, in that regard, is the same, if lighter and shallower (Yardley does refer aspiring writers to some deeper and more involved tomes, to her credit). Where the chick lit leaning of the book comes in is in providing a pretty good list of chick lit friendly contacts-- agents, editors, presses, that sort of thing. Paradoxically, of course, all of that material will come in handy after you've written your novel and are ready to sell it; perhaps a more comprehensive subtitle would have been appropriate for the book? Certainly not the worst how-to-write tome I've ever read, but I was expecting more nuts-and-bolts type stuff. ***"
2,Couldn't keep reading it,"After I read this author's history of Chick Lit fiction I couldn't continue reading. It was ignorant and irresponsible. This book clearly was dashed off in order to make a quick buck. Good luck, writers, but don't quote this book to anyone if you want to be taken seriously."
5,You will want to listen to this CD over and over again.,"""Volume 1"" contains some of Earl Klugh's best work. Unlike some of his newer, more commercial ""smooth jazz"" recordings which are contaminated by electronic effects and rhythm boxes, Volume 1 is classical jazz at its best from an acoustic trio with a virtuoso guitar player. Klugh's work on ""How Insensitive"" transcends excellent. Trio's interpretations of standards like ""Night and Day"" and ""I'll Remember April"" are elegant amd pure, while more contemporary tunes like ""Bewitched"" and ""I Say a Little Prayer"" are covered with original and cheerful rearrangements."
5,Probably the best of all the Earl Klugh recordings!,"This recording renders the classic jazz compositions like, Night and Day, and Insensitive, and brings them to another level of artistic flavor. This is truly the music to wine and dine your loved ones by! You will also find yourself reading your favorite books and looking over your life's victories with this music in the background. This disc is only for those that demand the best, and know what it is!!!"
4,Makes a good gift,Sorry I can't review this music - I bought it a few years ago for a friend that said she loved it . Never got to hear it and really don't want to given her taste in music .
3,"Book needs to be revisited, rewritten and updated...too many important facts and people not mentioned.","The book is okay, but it's missing so much information.....and just as others have noted, there are too many secular artist mentioned that should not have been included in this book. The writer might want to revisit project and write a second adidition .... Being more thorough in his research ... Keeping in mind the subject ""Gospel Encylopedia"" and focus more on the true gospel artist rather than secular artist whose music does not ""Honor God"" using foul and explicit language."
1,Every Page Another Stupid Joke,"The concept in the ""...for Dummies"" series is to write in a friendly style and give the reader some substantial information along the way. What you get in this waste of paper is tons of useless unfunny attempts at humor with some passing references to DOS along the way.Most of his book is just padding, and you get maybe one useful sentence per page. After reading it for awhile, I started to notice the phrase, ""go talk to an expert to get this done..."" popping up again and again. Well... I buy a how-to book in order to learn something new. I already know that I can pay to have an expert do just about anything for me. The writer telling me to just ""go consult an expert"" defeats the reason for buying a how-to book.Save your money and buy something else."
4,The Short List,"The manuals that come with DOS editions are very complete. However, time is of the essence and something a bit more abridged works wonders. Also, if the idea is to train or retrain someone on DOS, this book is a fun way to get back in to it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Do you have a friend that knows DOS, or an IT professional that is willing to teach you? Either way, do not buy this book, because if it may be useful to you he tells you to ask a friend or a professional. He is painfully not humorous or clever either, though he thinks he is.You will learn more Google-ing DOS than you will from this book... which is not saying much. Look into Peter Norton's Complete Guide to DOS 6.22 if you want to know how to use DOS and or write batch files."
2,GOOD at most bits BAD at some bits.,"I thought it is aright book and a good reference book. The reason why I gave a low rating because in some parts it lost me. I didn't understand a bit in those parts which lost me. It had a tiny bit of humour and got boring at most times. There is also good think about and a bad thing about the book. I will tell the good thing, it tells you how to connect printers, modems and other hardware. If you are a beginner who knows ZIP about installing hardware and software this is the book. But on the other hand I knew how to install hardware and software so it got boring. There should be two types of book, the book which is released now and a new book only about DOS nothing else."
4,"This book explained about DOS, and Campared it with Windows","I thought that the book was an excellent book. It easily told you what DOS is doing, and why it is not as good as MS Windows. The book also gave the difference between the different DOSes there are. There is not much to say about this book , only that it is a great book. I have to say, DOS is very annyoing and slow, and the book really pushed that. That is why I am giving this book a 4"
1,Waste of money,I tried so many of the key commands in this book and 99% of them did not work. This bites because I wasted my money I was better off with out this.
1,Dos For Children,"This book has little or no real content. It looks good on the surface but there is nothing underneath.In the interest of system safety the author has left out so much information it leaves the book essentially useless. Worse, it gives the impression that some of the things you may need to do can't be done.This book may be okay for teaching children a limited use of dos but anyone that has any judgement at all needs more information."
5,first saw them flagship hotel galveston.group was maybe 2 years old,ezra has one of the best texas bands around my wife and i first saw them flagship hotel galveston texas around the 70s they were maybe 2years old lots and lots of r @ b go see them when you can last time i saw them live was in galves at the belanise room . ike tore belanise room up. thanks to the works for many years of music.check um out.
4,Whetting the Appetite,"Patti LaBelle once said ""The older I get, the stronger I get. My voice gets better with age."" She was right. The Patti on this album is young, spry, but still filled with the ""Bluebelle"" mentality. The group is excellent in their harmonies. Patti's interpretations of the lyrics are wonderful. ""Time and Love,"" ""Wild Horses,"" and ""Morning Much Better"" showcase the pure funk and soulfullness of the group. I gave this album a 4, because on it's own, it is great. If you have never heard a LaBelle album, then you should start with this on and go to each in chronological order. When compared to later albums, this would get a 3 or maybe a two; but on it's own, it is a masterpeice. It does just what it says, ""LABELLE,"" it introduces you to Patti, Nona, and Sarah. It wets the appetite for more."
5,This book made me a scientist,"I haven't looked at newer versions of this book, but I will say that I took this class as a high school freshman in 1979, and I will never forgetit. This book made science come alive for me, and the experiments were very eye-opening to my young mind. I completely agree with the science teacher that said that the use of real lab equipment made students feel ""grown up"". I wonder if the reviewer who didn't like the book so well actually did any of the experiments. It is the experiments that really make this course shine and instill an understanding of scientific concepts that you cannot get by reading material. The final ""sludge"" experiment at the end was the best! So, here I am, 30 years later, and I still remember that class. That should tell you something. It is sad to me that it is not taught more often in schools, I wish my own kids could take it."
3,Some great somewhat dated work intermixed w/ junior high,"The title track, Space is the Place, is great. The free 70's jamming fusion sound works well even if dated. There's some great vocal jamming especially from the male voice. Some spots get thin, but overall it works. The second track, Images, starts with a beautiful piano intro. When the ensemble comes in it sounds like a junior high group. The trumpets are out of tune and their tones don't blend. This junior high ensemble playing also taints Discipline. The saxes & drums always sound good. The trumpet solos in Discipline and Sea of Sound work well especially the 2 trumpets squealing on Sea. The trumpet solo on Images made me want to turn off the system. Stylistically, the second & third tracks sound more like standard jazz works while the other three tracks are fusion jamming."
2,dissapointing record!,"The title track quickly goes on the nerves. The endless repeating of the phrase ""Space is the place"" (20 minutes) is not inspiring, it is just dull and awkward. There ARE some good moments in it, like the human voice improvisation at about 12min, but overall I was very dissapointed of the song. The two tracks after it are not crap, but not very good either. ""Sea of sounds"" is good, real ""space jazz"". The last song is a throwaway. This is the only album of Sun Ra I own, but it didnt got me intrested to look up other things."
2,"""The Bill Wilson and Lenny Magill Showl""","That's what this should have been titled as a great part of the DVD is simply an infomercial for Wilson Combat's lubrication products (Wilson drags the viewer through tests of about 4 competing brands of oil against his ""super"" lube, Yawn!) and his custom gun parts and the final kicker at the end of the ""show"", Lenny Magill's song and dance about his DVD's and videos that are for sale.The relatively short segment on the P226 Sig by Wilson was ok but rather lackluster ""Liven it up Bill"", sheesh! The Q&A; segment on shooting, ammo etc was the ""tell me something I don't already know"" kind.Either sell the DVD as "" Bill Wilson and Lenny Magill Promotions with a segment on the P226,"" or cut the price in half!Disappointing!"
4,Good with an issue,This seat back for the roc-n-soc throne and stool is sturdy and provides much needed back support. However on any of the stools (I have not heard of this happening with drum thrones) it only allows a 30 degree turn ratio after install. I truly with this wasn't the case as it is a real problem getting up when I am surrounded by a miking array when I am recording acoustic guitar. I now have to crawl under the mics to escape.The good outweighs the negatives in this case though. But I wish R/S would have a seat lift adaptor to allow their stools to turn 100 degrees as before.
5,The Best Musical Chair,It is the chair I wanted for comfort and dependability. I am happy with my choice and the quality of workmanship.
5,Hang on to your dreams,Wonderful music by some very talented musicians. Paul and Friends are fantastic. There music is so wonderful to listen to. I hope they make more CD's in the future.
4,Moody science,I LOVE Moody Science videos!!! This one is not quite as good of quality as some of the others. Still a fantastic movie and message.
5,Best Law School Resource Availiable,Any one thinking about going to law school must buy this book. This book contains the admissions index graphs that can't be found anywhere else.
2,Made for TV?,"Was this a major release? God, I hope not. They couldn't have spent much money on this film. It seemed flat and uninspired. The script and the acting was second rate. At no point was this film remotely believable. I watched it on TV for free when nothing else was on. That would be the only way to watch it!"
1,This movie was the worst...,The acting was terrible and the plot was thin. A bette bet would be Mission to Mars starring Gary Sinese.
5,FANTABULUS (I made that up just for this book),"The most inspiring, nonreligious book on the face of the earth, a book that all who taste will savor for a lifetime. I laughed and cried in the same paragraph all the way through......great!"
5,Great book on Divination,"We Celtic Welsh Pagans feel very strongly about books which give us a taste of authentic celtic magickal arts. This is Celtic knowledge with a Welsh/American perspective. But the Welsh Magickal culture it explores from an American perspective is enlightening. I find it refreshing and not unfavorable to The Welsh. I also, as an English resident of Wales feel the Welsh atheist witchcraft trashers should get a life and work towards obtaining a totally separate government, then they can make it a law that only Welsh citizens may write about Wales. I do not agree entirely with the author as far as some of his ideas are concerned but as far as I can surmise, ideas are part of the freedoms guaranteed by the United Nations declaration of human rights. I applaud the author. He obviously doesn't mind the attention for i have seen articles by some of his supporters in publications here in the UK as well as the US. I hope he makes a ton of English Pounds, Euros, Francs and dollars."
5,How to find lost items,"Excellent book on divination. This book is causing a great hubub in Welsh Pagan circles only because it has been mentioned by pagans who want to be known as the be all of Welsh Paganism. They don't want a yank to be known as a Welsh Witch, so they have inlisted the help of neo-wales extremists who invent e-mail addresses and keep trashing the author. Not the book mind you. The book is great. The book is true. And how would I know? Because until last week I was loosely associated with this bonkers group. They have become nasty and obsessed and totally bonkers. The book is Great. The author is honest. The time is right."
1,quite some claims,If you ar credulous you will love this book. If you can ignore the fact that this is not based on any real Celtic culture that is. Readable but untrue.
5,Spectacular pictures and valuable information,"An excellent book, full of great pictures of birds and a lot of information about them.Excellent!!"
4,Pearl-tastic!,Great item to replace some nuts that i`d lost during a show. the fact they come wtih washers made me soo happy.must get more soon to replace my old nuts.
3,Not a good purchase for younger boys unless they are very gentle,"We bought this truck about 8 mos. ago for my 4 yr old's birthday. Although both he and his 6 yr old brother enjoyed playing with the truck, opening and closing the doors and putting the back ramp up and down, it started to break within a few weeks. First the back door broke off along one of the corner connections, then a couple of months later, there were a couple of other corners that broke at the connection points, and finally, a couple of weeks ago, I turned around and the whole truck was completely broken and was a pile of rectangled plastic parts on the ground. Not sure how this truck compares with the other Bruders trucks, but there is a definite need to improve the durability along the corners. My boys are boys, but are not overly rough when it comes with their toys or trucks. We love the design of the product, but I would not recommend this truck unless you have a very gentle child or a child 8 or older."
1,Promoting Cruelty,"Where would you be transporting these Dairy Cows? Pretty sure the only place they are taking a ride to is the slaughterhouse. After Dairy cows are used up from being constantly impregnated & their babies stolen from them (babies can't have that milk, it is for humans), they get a lovely trip to slaughterhouse to killed for dog food."
2,Decent Caulk,"I bought this to seal up some cracks around my exterior windows and some of the siding. It has already started to crack, and shrink. Most of the caulk I used (2 months ago), basically needs to be recaulked. I wouldn't recommend it for exterior use. Maybe for interior that isn't exposed to weather."
2,Insanely overpriced,"Caulk itself is great, but you can buy this exact same tube at discount store for only $2. That's four tubes for the price of one here."
5,ROC N SOC NITRO VS. DW9000,I compared the roc n soc and DW thrones with backrest side by side... The roc n soc was much more comfortable
3,"Nice, but...","I like this product for how it helps my old, sorry back keep from getting too tired when I play. I do not like, however, that it keeps coming loose. The throne is such a nice product that I wish they would have put more thought into how this attaches to it."
5,This is Great!,"My son said, ""Why haven't I had this for the past 10 years? It has helped my back so much!"""
3,"negative pressure, not positive pressure","Ahem, just a brief comment. In the book, she refers to a bubble type environment, where someone is isolated, for fear that he might infect others. She says it is under positive pressure. Not so. It would actually be negative pressure, where the pressure inside would be less than in the entrance rooms. This is so that any particles would tend to be swept inside the room when the door is open.Positive pressure is just the opposite, and is used mostly in semiconductor clean rooms and surgical theatres, where you don't care if stuff inside the room leaks out, but you do not want particulates from outside leaking in."
5,great,Roger Whittaker is one of my favorite singers collecting all his Christmas CD really enjoying listing to his music a lot
4,Good Book,"Book arrived on time, Good condition.Clearly, Martin Luther was one of the most contriversial personages in the 16th century and his thoughts and beliefs changed Western civilization. Along with this firm beliefs about man and God came his rabid anti-Semitism, much of which the Nazis used as justification for their Final Solution (Die Endlosung)."
3,Here I Stand,This book was a great research source and a pretty easy read. I recommend this to anyone starting to study Martin Luther or the Reformation.
1,This Review Is For This Edition Only,"Roland H. Bainton's biography of Martin Luther is considered by many to be the quintessential work on Luther's life, but this edition by Abingdon Press is frankly awful. Measuring roughly 6 and 7/8 inches by 4 and 1/8 inches and printed on REALLY cheap paper, the text is tiny to the point of being virtually unreadable; even reading glasses render the text only marginally acquirable. The book appears to have a grudge against the reader and seems determined to surrender its content only under protest, and after the reader's most determined efforts. Bainton's classic work deserves much better treatment than this.My advice: Put out a few extra bucks and find an edition of this work which is actually readable."
1,Buyer Beware!,This edition of an otherwise wonderful book is terrible! The margins between the lines are so tight and the print so small and dense that one practically needs a magnifying glass to read it! We bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband's grandfather and were unable to give it to him because of its physical unreadability.
5,Roland Bainton's Luther,"""Here I Stand"" is both the keystone of Roland Bainton's series of Reformation studies, includinghis life of Sebastian Casellio, ""The Travail of Religius Liberty"" on Ochino, and the more condensed ""Reformation of the Sixteenth Century""; it was in the years of my visits to Germany, the ""1950's and 60's"", regarded there as the best Luther biobgraphy ever written. All Bainton's books were enlivened by numerous rreproductions of contemporary woodcuts, few of them published anywhere else, and more accessible than even the usually shown, vividly first-hand Cranach portraits, but this biography includes the cream of the crop, whose originals were often set up on the bookshelves of his Yale Divinity School office.Hugh Barbour, Earlham College & School of Religion emeritus"
5,Outstanding and very readable,This seems to be the authoritative biography of Martin Luther. I had no complaints reading it and enjoyed the learning.
2,static,"I felt that this bio engauge to much in the theology and not enough in a narrative of action. Luther lead a dangerous and exciting life both mentally and consequently physically. I never sensed the danger in this book, and the theology could be over bearing and cumbersome. A better bio is by J.H. Merle D'Aubigne--The life and Times of Martin Luther. There you hear more of the debates from the participants' mouths and follow more closely Luther's journey--it is exciting--as it should be."
3,I Stand Alone,"Good information on an important historical figure, but the reader has to tolerate far too much of the inane. For example, ""...radio, television, and not even the internet were during John Calvin's time."" Good to know."
1,Would not play.,Couldn't play this DVD. It is now advertised as not playable on many players but I bought it too soon. Whoops and sorry.
2,Good 3D for video. Bad movie for everything else.,"If you can get a 3d copy of this movie then skip part one altogether as the only good parts of the first show up here and they barely knew what they were doing in that first project.I mean what kind of 3d film shows a marshmellow going into the flame from behind someones shoulder? You're supposed to point it at the camera ,you nitwit that's what makes it pop out! Basically the main reason to watch this empty headed opus is for the gory effects and to see what this commercially available 3d lens can do for any standard or digital camcorder.If these Bozos can make a 3d film with an almost non existant budget think what you can do with your drunken friends and a yo-yo expert.Buy this as a what not to do film and enjoy the goofy gore coming out of the screen.Dukey Flyswatter"
3,plenty of blood for everyone,"movie worthy of 3 stars but thats about it. at least the murder scenes are above average, otherwise a decent movie, especially for a low budget film. what's with the cast of the movie though?the director's assistant is a drunk and looks up all the girl's skirts? and the director sure didn't have much of a crew or cast, very very unrealistic. think they could have done a much better job on this movie thats for sure. i'm sure there will be plenty of sequeals though considering the amount of people that think their going to be cult classics."
2,terrible yet better then the first,"*SPOILER THIS MOVIE IS DUMB*this movi may be made by my favorite B-movie company and thats the only reason I payed 2 dollars for this. Dead-Alive which released Meet the Feebles My favorite movie made by Peter Jackson (The Frightners, Lord of the rings) but this movie is literly terrible it is almost as bad as a kick in the nuts."
3,Get the 3-D version of this one,"Both the first CAMP BLOOD and this sequel were shot in 3-D. Both a flat and a 3-D DVD of the first one are out; but the current DVD of CAMP BLOOD 2 is flat only. However, a 3-D version is on VHS, so a DVD may happen at some point. Get the ULTIMATE 3-D HORROR COLLECTION from Amazon.com which includes 3-D DVD, and the system and glasses needed t watch in 3-D as well!"
5,Wish me Luck series 3,We have the other two parts.We had to have part 3 to finnish out the series and to see the outcome.It is worth watching.
5,Absolutely Engaging!,"Good drama with superb acting. Good story line too. I liked the character...forgot her name, playing the code translator. She was hot headed and I could see how she left doubts with the superiors. However, she turned out to be determined and held out. I couldn't wait to start the next segment...Series 2."
2,Wish me luck review,Unfortunately We felt that the last episodes of Wish me luck left a lot to be desired -way to much story around the priest and some other characters instead of making the actual story and history of this herioc group of people --the fact that this little town could hold up like it did with little or no actual military might and the times that no help was on its way got to be --been there done that type of thing --not to believeable and not very interesting.
4,More thrash than EXPANDING SENSES,"This album is really great. Could have done with a bit more melody in some parts, definately has some STRAPPING YOUNG LAD elements mixed in. Swedish metal in general just rules and this is no exception, although not really a contender for my best album of the year. The instrumentals and their titles also come accross as slightly lame. Fav trancks: Secondary Effects, Fading Dimensions and Godforsaken Universe. If your not into DARKANE yet, I suggest purchasing EXPANDING SENSES before this album. Enjoy..."
4,layers of lies review,"Some aspects of this album basically pick up where expanding senses left off. However, Darkane has also gone back to the Rusted Angel days which is refreshing to fans of the original style of this melodic yet Chaotic band."
1,WARNING,"This product is not suitable for all Palm Tungstens. Although the product claims to be for all ""Tungsten series"" PDAs, it is too long for the Tungsten C (and probably the Tungsten W.) I bought this product because it was listed as an accessory for the Tungsten C but it is not compatible with the C unless you want to cut it to size."
1,Incompatible with Tungsten T3,"What the seller fails to mention (but the packaging clearly states) is that these overlays are for the ""Tungsten T/m500 series."" The package further states: ""Compatible With Tungsten T, m500, m505, m515 & Palm V/Vx handhelds"" (Wouldn't that be good to know before ordering!!!) By contrast, this web page describes the product as, ""PalmOne Tungsten series Screen Protector."" We unwary Tungsten T3 owners might assume that includes us, but we would be wrong. Since the overlays are too small for my T3, I cannot cut them down to size. Owners of other Tungsten models which do not happen to be the ""Tungsten T"" may be likewise out of luck. Beware!"
4,WELL DONE MAESTRO,"As an argentino, that grew up listenning to the Beatles and CCR, I must say that this book was quite an enlightning experience.It opened my curiosity with regards to the history of Africo-Argentino culture. It is not dead, thank you milonga.I have a copy signed by Mr thompson and really didnt know what I'd gotten until I went home and read the book.His theories, to my scrutiny, are sound.You may not see 'blacks' in Argentina now a days but, an underlined racism still lingers.I have had difficulty talking about this book with relatives and friends.I think that Mr Thompson has done a great catharthic piece that will test the Argentine historians for years to come.Although the lyrics could have been translated closer to the point, using a less literal method.I believe that this book is 'heavy' more so than anything else out there.It has more knowledge per page and hopefully will inspire a new generation of writers within the Argentino culture.Thank you! Mr Thompson."
5,Great book,"I found the book wonderful. It is especially good on the influences of other cultures on the development of tango in Argentina -- Spain, Africa, Cuba -- all nicely fleshed out. A terrific read."
3,Respectful effort,"I was so excited about reading the book... But even the first few pages brought nothing but disappointment... Writing manner is very heavy, in addition to overwhelming, almost encyclopedic compendium of facts. As the result - reading very quickly becomes boring. It seems the author is more concerned about telling the reader everything he knows on the subject, instead of creating an engaging narrative. I respect and admire Mr. Thompson's knowledge, but I can't bring myself to finish reading his book. Not such a great choice for a tango enthusiast, rather a specialist."
5,Tango the Art History of Love,A must read for anyone serious about Tango and the history of the dance.
1,You get what you pay for,Lightweight to the point of cheapness and didn't even fit my car's power jack. My advice: look for a better product.
1,lost in the feeling,"this was not a very good country cd. not country, to modern. mark went the wrong way on this one.but what do I know?"
2,Over-produced,"I really like Mark Chesnutt's singing, but, for my hard-country taste, his recordings suffer from Mark Wright's over-production. I do not like string sections in country music, and Wright seems to love to drown out Paul Franklin's steel guitar with lush strings. This album is another step down that road. Too bad."
3,Good Board for the Price,"For the price, this is an excellent board. But it is made of particle board (it is somewhat flimsy but stiff enough). If you are serious about a good board, I recommend the EZ board by Lucy Chu."
3,Just ok,This board is a great idea however the white board is cheesy and not the normal quality that other white boards are. I don't think it will last long.
2,Need more Freestyle!!!!!!,"Kenny does some good producing,but his solo album is not my favorite.I have a couple of his Freestyle releases like Linda Low and his Freestyle maxi""Freak in you"".I enjoyed the Feetyle songs but not the R&B/HIPHOP which is played eveyday on the radio and T.V.and tends to be way overated and overplayed!"
3,experation date,"I was disappointed with the experation date on this product. Buying 24 of something is taking a chance as it is but when you get them and then have to use it all in a couple of months that is a negative. As for the product, not bad for the price but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I will stick with what I can get at the grocery store."
5,"It is, indeed, the Ultimate Collection","Two terrific and comprehensive disks by one of the greatest female singers of all time, in any genre. I've loaned this out to a lot of people who aren't country fans, and they all love it. It's simply a must-have for anyone's collection."
5,Don't judge a CD by its cover,What a terrible picture of Patsy.I had to change to the picture on the reverse side.But this is a wonderful Patsy album. Great songs andall your favorites are included.
1,False Advertising,The product makers describe this as an interactive calculus tutorial - which it flat out isn't. It's a homework problem solver. The difference between the product description and what was actually in the package is amazing. I wasted close to sixty bucks on this product. Don't do the same!!!!
4,Creative Bubblegum Music,"Originally released in 1968 on Buddah. Repertoire CD reissue in 1989. For fans of this band's memorable bubble gum hits, this will be a surprise. Sure there are a couple of hits (Simon Says, Take A Giant Step and Pop Goes The Weasel)but most of the remaining tracks cover a variety of styles and stand on their own as time period nuggets. Remember that these guys were in the studio after the summer of love and pop hits would soon give way to prog. Some of these tracks appear on the hits collections but most don't - I looked. I found this in a discount bin and took a shot. I am glad I did. You may also get a simliar reaction to the Ohio Express LP tracks - recent 2-on-1 CD reissues have tracks that are more Sugerloaf than bubblegum. After giving this CD a couple of listens, it is clear that Katz Kasenetz were more musically creative than their press ever let on. Worth looking around for."
3,"blah, doesn't work","My cat peed once on a brand new very large microfiber/polly fill cushion.Three complete soakings of natures magic and the cushion still smells like cat pee.I instead poured this on some food spills on a rug. Dissolved the food just fine, rug clean. Maybe its useful for something, but not my cat's pee."
1,Buy the regular Nature's Miracle instead!,"We (unfortunately) have a good amount of experience with regular Nature's Miracle and the excellent job it does neutralizing the smell of cat pee. So, when we discovered that one of our cats decided to pee on the carpet again, we figured the ""Just for cats"" should be at least as good, if not better, right?Wrong.This stuff is worthless. 2 months after pouring a gallon of this junk on our carpet, it still smells like pee. We are giving up and trying the Rug Doctor pet shampoo before we decided on replacing the entire carpet.I wish I would have stuck to the regular Nature's miracle cause that worked great. Sometimes ""New and improved"" isint."
2,Didn't work for me,I am sure this must work for some but for me my kitty kept revisiting the oops. I've tried many of these type products and the only one I have ever found that completely took out the odor was a product called What Odor?. I have been using that product for going on 4 years now and have not had one instance of revisiting any oops.
1,"Formulation has changed, doesn't work anymore","In the past, I've used Nature's Miracle for Cats with good results. Now it no longer works. Not only can the cat smell the old urine, I can too. I hired a vet behaviorist for my cat because he's peeing on the rug and bed. She said that the formulation for Nature's Miracle changed after the company was sold, and that's why the product no longer works for me. I told a friend who is active in animal rescue what the vet said, and my friend echoed the vet's sentiments--the rescue community has also noticed that it no longer works. Save your money and get another product that does work. The vet recommended Anti Icky Poo, which is admittedly a stupid name, but you won't soon forget it."
1,No success,"I have used this product time and time again to get out some new pee spots with no success. It initially gets the smell out for a short period of time, and then after it is dry again it starts to smell. I particularly like the directions on the bottle that state that if urine odor remains, then you did not pour on enough product. Blame the customer for your product not working and tell them to ""just use more"". This is probably why it comes in whopping gallons."
1,Didn't work.,"It's possible that the urine stains were too old, too large and too dry, but I saturated them with the product and the smell just got worse. I ended up using home remedies for removing stains I found on the internet which worked much, much better. I've since tried this product on a fresh vomit stains after I'd already cleaned the worst of it (which it's also meant to get rid of, according to the bottle), and it hasn't worked, either. Either my cats have particularly potent digestive and urinary systems, or this stuff really isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm definitely not buying it again."
1,"Should be called ""Cat Attract""","I purchased this item so that I could get rid of some existing smelling spots on our carpet and to have in case our cats ever had an accident. I sprayed it on a spot on the carpet that smelled faintly of urine and next thing I know my cat who, as far as I know, has never sprayed anything sprayed the spot that I had just used the product on. The only reason I can think of for this is that something in the spray makes them feel the need to spray. Seems like a good plan if you're trying to get people to constantly need to buy your product. I will not be buying this again, and instead plan on trying a vinegar followed by baking soda hydrogen peroxide and dish soap home remedy which I hope will work better. At least the people giving this information aren't making any money off of it."
5,Great Book,"This is an amazing book if you are feeling down on your luck, or keep thinking pessimistically over things in life. Great motivation to change your life into the right direction.Thanks Prof. Luciani!"
5,Excellent Read,"One of the best, if not the best, self help book that i've ever read. In fact, you could call it the self-help book to end all self-help books, because saying ""self-help"" so many times kind of drives you mad.Anyway, start to finish this is a really excellent book. It's especially good for people that like to blame others and outside influences for their problems. While it can be the case, most of the time our shortfalls are self-inflicted."
3,Changed my mind,"My original review is below. Since then, I have been going back to this book a lot. So, bottom line, it's much better than I originally thoughtI agree with both positive and negative reviews. Yes, the book has three or four insights that I found really useful. It is sort of CBT meets Purpose Driven Life (no refs to God though). On the other hand, it is bloated beyond belief. Net net, worth buying and reading"
3,"Good Book, but Takes a While to Get Moving","It's odd and mildly annoying that Luciani keeps telling the reader that he'll be teaching us techniques and approaches that will help us with our issues, that we'll be getting to it shortly, that it's coming soon, but the remainder of the book gets thinner and thinner and the techniques take forever to materialize.That is, the first part of the book is largely filler, which is pretty common these days in self-help books, and the meat takes forever to come around. Lots of surveys and fill-in-the-blank sections to make the book easier to write, naturally.I wish Luciani had really gotten down to business from the very beginning, and just laid it all out on the table, so to speak, instead of dancing around the topic for so long.That said, there are some great bits of advice in this book, and overall it was worth the money and the time to read it."
2,A Big Disappointment,"When I first saw that Rancid had a new CD coming out, I could barely wait to get my hands on it. I got addicted to the infectious sing alongs contained in ""Wolves"" and ""Life"" and to a lesser extent, ""Let's Go"". I popped the CD in a listened to the first track; I waited for the hook. To quote, ""It's like waitin' for the bus, but the bus it won't come"". The song started and then ended; in between was about two minutes of screaming guitar, obnoxious vocals, racing drums and quite inventive bass. To say the least, I was disappointed.Take this CD for what is is, it is nothing like the music put out in the late 90's. It's similar to Rancid/93, but not as fun to listen to. I admit that I am not an ardent punk fan, but I am a solid Rancid fan. Don't expect much from this unless you are just crazy about punk. Rancid is a punk band again and I don't like it."
2,A forced piece of crap album.,"WORST RANCID RECORD. First hearing this album right before I saw them on the Warped Tour of 2000, I truly can't say that there were really any stand out songs. I was relieved upon seeing these guys play maybe one song from this. My conclusion to why these guys put out this album is because LIFE WON'T WAIT was excessively said to be a sell out album. Too experimental, maybe... I haven't listened to LIFE WON'T WAIT but I'll bet it is better than this album. This is more like 'thrash' than any of the other albums. Rancid are not good at playing thrash. I suggest a DRI record instead of this."
2,Rancid can Flex,"the release of this album marked the muscle that rancid posesses in their ranks and their ability to use it. the release of life won't wait was an experiment for the band that allowed them to explore their creative side much like the clash did with sandinsta!. many critics and ""fans"" of rancid's music saw this as some sort of weakness in a formidable punk band. anyone who appreciates rancid's talent should recognize the evolutionary steps the band takes to keep the soul of punk alive and well in this conformity ridden genre that is turning more pop than punk everyday thanks to bands like new found glory and blink 182. rancid 2000 is the oratory spit in the faces of these [faux] punkers. the music is hard fast and loud, perfect medicine for the usual radio fodder. those who long for another ""...out come the wolves"" should wake up and realize that the music is moving on without you."
1,A Terrible Retreat,"Life Won't Wait by Rancid approached in musical terms what the Clash did on Sandanista! That album was ripped by the punker-than-thou crowd as being ""soft"" or a ""sell-out"". It was, in truth neither. After making svereal brilliant albums Ranid listened to their critics rather than their fans and regressed musically on the self-titled album. the album is a mind-numblingly dull set of 1:30-2:00 songs played in their best Ramones on crack style. The guitars are fast, the vocals loud, the message non-existant and it seems like the calls for social change so evident on their other albums is gone in favor of pointless anger. The only redemption for this album is the song Let Me Go which lives up to what Rancid has done before. Skip this alumb and buy Life Won't Wait, Let's Go or ..out come the Wolves to hears their band at their best."
4,A Glorious Return to Classic Form,"My Early teenage years were filled with the loud sounds of Rancid vibrating my walls. They took all my anger and channeled it out of me. When i was in the eighth grade there third album was released ""and out come the wolves"". This was a great album, and it really gave me nice punk trilogy to choose from. Then I waited and waited for the fourth album. And when ""Life wont wait"" was released my feelings for the band were crushed. I dont think that its concievable to think that there was ever a worse album released than that. And now after my waining away from punk, and my self-assurance that Rancid was done, This new album was delevered upon me. Furious, unrelenting, and death defying decibel devastation. This is almost like a catharsis of youth as I face adulthood this friday. I am happy, to say the least."
1,PUNK Rancid,Liked their previous album because of their experimental in to Jamaican & caribbean music. Im sure for the hard core punkers this album is good. But I appreciate Rancid's ability to experiment and mirror the efforts of the Clash. Same ol punk stuff. nothing new.
3,not their best work,"this cd goes to show how much rancid likes to expierament. this comes off as both a good and a bad thing. the good is that theres nothing wrong with a little variety, the bad is that rancid already had their best sound down pat long before this CD was even a twinkle in Tim Armstrong's eyes. Now before you say i wasnt helpful, go listen to lets go and out come the wolves by Rancid, and you'll understand."
3,My Review...,"First off I would like to state, that I was told Rancid was Punk and Punk is Rancid. Well not like, but something like it. My friends said to me pick up a Rancid cd. And being that I like Punk, I did. Being that it is called Rancid, I picked it up thinking it was the first. I was wrong.This band is fast paced and full of good sounds, I will give it that but come on, it was pretty bad. A lot of Punk bands have bad lead singers, this one supports that view. The guy[s] must spit like a champ[s]. The guitar and drums were very well done. They get you pumped. But sadly, they are drowned out by the vocals.This is the FIRST Rancid cd I have listend to. I hope it will not be my last. I do not think I will give up on them. Maybe their three earlier cds will be better. Who knows?So, I am saying this bluntly, the vocals do not complement the drums and guitars. That is just me, maybe the rest of the world loves it.An OK choice.Thanks,P E A C ER Y A N"
3,And Out Come the Wolves,"So heavy-metal Rancid, huh? Da-ra-da-da like Don Giovonni . . . and so goes the record . . . absoutely--furiously boring. The amazon reviewer is right; they like to scream. The record is characteristic of those stupid death metal bands that play the same formulaic songs. I guess this is their ""dark"" album. This is Rancid proving a point, nothing more. You have to give them credit though. You have to have a lot of balls to pull this off. There a few songs like Don Giovonni and Let Me Go and little bitty pieces of chrouses on some other ones that are pretty good. For example, Rwanda. Radio Havana kinda skews off. Bodies, I think, has a good, but thin groove. There are hardly any tunes or hooks. Punk, heavy-metal, rock, whatever you want to call it, the music is much rancid. three stars for effort and furiousness."
2,Worst album from my favorite band,"Any music review is founded in opinion. Rancid is my favorite band, I have all of their CD's and know most songs by heart. I feel like they made this record to prove they were still punk, whatever that means these days. Personally I could care less about what gets labeled this or that. I didn't enjoy this record from first listen and it never grew on me. If I wanted loud nonsense I would have headed down to a local high school punk band show. These guys are better than this and it left me very dissapointed. My favorite Rancid discs are Life Won't Wait and Out Come the Wolves. If you enjoy their ska influenced songs look elsewhere."
5,The best punk album since suffer.,The album is amazing...It is such an amazing experience just to listen to this album. This may very well be one of the best truly artistic punk (or any music) album that ive ever heard.
3,GBH-Style,"True, Rancid have always been accused of selling out, of wanting to be Strummer and Co, and their every move has been scruntinized. With this release, Rancid have went back to basics, it is more like GBH than the Clash, though melody lies beneath the chaos. Tim and Lars sound as angry as I've ever heard them and whenever Matt sings, he sounds in top notch form (he has a good streetrock voice.) A decent record. Particularly ""Radio Havanna"", ""Rwanda"", ""It's Quite Alright"" and ""Dead Bodies"". All in all, I guess they wanted to return to punk roots but I still perfer the Clash-style Rancid singalongs."
5,SHUT UP ABOUT BEING PUNK ENOUGH,"people are always saying whether a cd is ""punk"" or not?...does it classify what ""punk"" means? well..SHUT UP ABOUT PUNK OR NOT...punk is not just music, its way of life...what makes an album ""punk"" or not...who are YOU to judge?...the majority of you critics haven't even tried recording and only want the same old first album Rancid sound, well bands need to change and if for some chance they strike a chord in the populus don't accuse them of sellingout...do u not think it is good the majority of people know about punk and the ideas that go along with it....so who are u to judge whats ""Punk"" or not?..i'm not and neither are You..so shut up about it..critque an album for its messege or change in music..but don't judge whether it is ""punk"" or not because chances are you don't even know what it means.."
2,What did they sing actually?,"Oh my God, never imagine that Rancid has music this hard with unclear vocal on what Tim was saying...... And Out Come The Wolves is the best.."
3,A nice change.,"If you don't usually enjoy Rancid, and prefer something ""harder"", you'll find a little slice of heaven in songs like ""Corruption"", ""Loki"", ""Young Al Capone"" in this album."
5,"Great rancid stuff. usual stuff, but still good.","it's a great new cd with great songwriting. it's alot like ""life wont wait"", but i like that. hard, fast rock."
1,Best Band Ever,You gotta admit rancid has had some great albums in the past but nothing compares to this one. They have experienced with so many different styles of music and this one gives you a nice hardcore punk sound. If you like true punk bands get this CD. Rancid has a lot of passion for their music and thats a nother reason why you should buy this CD. They are a great band and this is a great CD.
1,"Turn the page, and learn a new chord","Biggest letdown of the year. I read through the previous reviews, thinking that this release, would rival the classic: And Out Come the Wolves. Not even close. What a lazy, repetitive collection of teeth-grinding-Skil_saw-through-sheet-metal nonsense. I was visibly shocked and appalled, at this shallow offering.Unfortunately, this is one of those rare instances, when you listen to a new CD once, place it back into it's case, and toss it on the pile of garage rags and empty beer cans. Where it belongs."
1,nevermind Rancid,"Kids, this ain't punk. You can't handle punk.Give this CD to your puppy, and while he or she chews it up, take a copy of Black Flag's ""Live '84"" and slide it into your player. Turn it up till your ears bleed. Then make sure you destroy yourself before you're 22.That, children, is punk."
2,Rancid meet The Exploited,"Gone are The Clash influences, only to be replaced by a heavy dose of The Exploited. While ""Life Won't Wait"" pushed the ska experimentation of ""Wolves"" perhaps too far, this latest release abandons their ska influences for the noisy guitars and mumbled screaming of early 80's British punk. Only they don't do it as well.The album is obviously a purposeful shift from their previous sound, as if the band is out to disprove the unfair criticism that they are just Clash wannabes. Unfortunately, rather than continuing to develop their own unique sound, Rancid has instead settled for the time weary crunch of melodyless punk."
5,See ya in the pit!,"Rancid has never failed to release a great album. Even the experimental music on Life Won't Wait was amazing. But this cd, out of all of Rancid's releases, is definately my favorite. I don't like this cd because it is catchy or because it has nice lyrics or anything, i just like it cause it is heavy street punk at it's rawest form. Rancid's music style has changed alot since their debut album, and I think that they have become alot heavier (as you can obviously see from this album). All of the songs are great, but I think the tracks that really stick out are Poison and Dead Bodies. Poison is a great track because it is extremely heavy and I like Dead Bodies because it has very catchy guitar and because (of course) it's heavy. Any Punk fan or Rancid fan should own this album. Matt Freeman is the best bass player ever!!"
3,Not my favorite Rancid,"This cd was hard for me to decide on. I would say about half of the songs I really liked, the other half, I really did not like. This is strange for me because I usually love every track on a Rancid cd. There were two songs that really are not good, they just throw out a bunch of curse words to a horrible beat. However, there is a lot of reggae influence which I really enjoy. This is not my favorite of theirs, but I'm still happy I own it."
5,kick ...[but] CD,"I discover Rancid wirh this cd and yep I discover an amazing band! This cd just rocks man it's awesome!!! Just like a punch in the face, a great punk-rock album!"
4,Best punk release of the millenium thusfar,"For their 2000 album, Rancid decided to drop the reggae inflicted pop of prior releases and churn out 100% pure aggressive punk rock. This CD is filled wall to wall with great songs played with conviction, many of which will hole themselves up inside of your head and keep you humming along for weeks to come.The rough and tumble vocal delivery and guitar sound roars over Matt Freemans godly basslines while sometimes wailing leads and infectious hooks pop out of nowhere to knock you on your posterior, making ""Rancid"" a fun album to listen to, drink to, hang out to, whatever.Just a great CD, and undeniably Rancid's best. If this is the end, then it is a fine way to go out."
2,Rancid Disappoints...Again,"I waited 3 years for this? For a generic hardcore punk CD? I did not get into Rancid because they sound like all the other punk bands out there. Don't get me wrong, I loved their first three albums, they had a unique sound, the perfect cross between punk and ska. Then they came out with their '97 rendition and it went too far towards ska. Their new album went to the opposite extreme. You can't understand a word they say (good thing the lyrics come with it) and every song is a blur of speed that is completely void of any resemblence to the style that made Rancid so appealing.For those who like this kind of sound, this maybe a good CD for you. But, for those who got hooked on Rancid because they stood out from the rest of the punk bands, this album is just bad."
4,It's good but not great,"This album is everything the reviewer said. However, it still isn't that great. If you want to listen to amazing punk, the truest definition of punk, I suggest you type ""The Refused"" in the search box and check out with ""The shape of punk to come."" That's raging punk."
5,Rancids new one is great!,"Hey, I just picked up the new Rancid at the local store. Wish I got here, it's a lot cheaper. This is absolutely riveting. It's the fastest Rancid album yet, but it still has that great Rancid kick to it. All you Rancid fans know what I mean. The great combination of fast punk rock with a nice melody to go along. Any true Rancid fan would already be clicking the ""Add to shopping cart"" button. Thanks"
3,I'm going blind,"...from trying to read the lyric sheet. For Christ sake, I know these guys have made some money, invest in a typewriter already.Maybe I'm getting old, but this one just doesnt do it for me like their last few albums. One of the reasosns I like Rancid so much is that they are not afraid to experiment with new styles. Here we have one style--full on, driving, punk rock. Which makes me wonder if they have taken the critcism of the punk purists too much to heart, and are trying to prove that they are old school.Lighten up boys, there's nothing wrong with throwing in a ska or dub number to give the ole ears a break."
2,Trying too hard.,"I never thought there would be such a thing as an overproduced punk album, But here it is. The only reason it sounds overproduced is because you can tell they tried too damn hard to make it sound raw. I didn't buy the guise, and neither will most punk fans.Rancids attempt at changing thier style doesn't go over well, and they need to learn not to be ashamed of thier punk/ska/reggae sound. If it aint broke, don't fix it guys.I'm giving it 2 stars just for the lyrics, which with Rancid are always great."
5,"classic Rancid, a must have for any punk fan","It's a major depature from their last ska based album. This one is heavy hitting hardcore punk, that's as angry as the original self titled and twice as loud. while it may be harder, the great elements that make Rancid immortal are all there: Tim and Lars' vocals, the awesome guitar hooks, the original bass lines, and the fury that lies at the very core of punk rock. For those who call them a Clash rip off, listen to this album: the clash never sounded like this! Most of the songs are very good, with a few exceptions. The first track, Don Giovanni, is pretty bad, and their are a few others in their as well. Soon to be classic songs, like let me go, more than make up for it. If you love Rancid, buy this album. If you love punk, buy this album. if you hate Rancid, and despise punk, buy it anyway: it may change your mind."
5,A must have,"This cd is off the hookie you need to have this cd, all the song and I mean all the songs are good.he dose some oldys like Rain on us and I do worship. some new songs like right here and changed me are off the hook."
3,One of the few sources of information about this topic,"It is a nice manual. It is not deep or detailed, but it is interesting for the beginner. There are not many ilustrations in the text, but this book brings a CD wich, however, is not good enough: videos are reasonable, in low resolution and small sized. The CD helps, but could be far better."
1,Not so good.,"Followed directions to the letter. Quarter cup of milk was way too much for the amount of cheese powder. I used a measuring cup, stirred and stirred, waited thinking it might thicken with standing, poured it over the shells and got shells with cheese water. Not creamy. Couldn't see it or taste it on the shells. I opened a box of Kraft macaroni dinner, added some of the cheese sauce and ended up with Annie's Kraft Dinner.I'm hoping maybe my cheese pack wasn't full. I plan on NOT following directions next time. I'll measure a quarter cup of milk and add it to the cheese powder a bit at a time until I get what I need, instead of adding the cheese sauce to a quarter cup of milk in the measuring cup."
4,Great Blade - Great Price,"This blade is the best value available for a 60T fine cutoff blade - bar none. The cuts are silky smooth with little or no tearout. I've used Freud blades in my shop for years, and you can't beat them when you consider the combination of price and quality. This blade in particular has yeilded great results."
3,miter saw hazard,"I bought this blade for rough and general use on a compound miter saw, keeping a Forrest blade for fine work. This blade is OK in a table saw but I found that it has a nasty habit of grabbing small cut-offs on my Delta CMS and throwing them. This happened once too many times... the last time it shattered the lower blade guard. As a result I retired the blade from use on the CMS.While replacing the blade guard on the CMS (which cost me more than this blade) I discovered that the dust chute had chunks of cut-offs wedged in it. I haven't had this problem with other miter saw blades (Delta, Forrest, Freud) so technique isn't the issue.The blade works just fine on a table saw for general use but get a blade with negative rake on the teeth for the miter saw. Your saw, your body, and your wits will be better off for it."
3,Jack of All Trades...,"....master of none. This blade has all the great aspects of a typical Freud blade - quality carbide, well built, anti-vibration slots, lifetime warranty, etc. It does alot of things reasonably well, but isn't particular strong in any regard, other than the TCG teeth are more durable than other grinds. Several of Freud's other general purpose blades crosscut better, rip more efficiently, have faster feedrates, and are generally more versatile. Being that it's full kerf, it also bogs the motor on my saw more than many others. I just can't find an application that gives this blade any advantages over others in my shop. I much prefer the LU86, LU88, and even the LU84."
3,"very wide kerf, slow cutting","It's probable that we didn't get exactly the blade that we wanted, but we got this for our Dewalt table saw and found that it cuts much slower than our previous (dull) blade and tends to burn the edge (it might be that we are out of alignment--but we didn't have that problem on the old blade and nothing has changed). It also has a very wide kerf, much bigger than we expected. If we hadn't already used it, we would have returned it and got something different."
3,Very Aggressive blade,"Never owned a Freud blade before bought this one because of the price, its well made very sharp but what Im noticing is how aggressive this blade is. You really got to stay alert when using it, have already had a couple times where it seems to grab the wood and pull it. Maybe it just me not use to a qaulity blade like this. Im use to big box cheap blades."
3,Not Great,"I bought this blade hoping it would be a great blade at a great price. I only used it on red oak and it burned the wood more than my craftsman blade. It also did not leave a smooth surface, instead it left tiny scoring lines. I sent it back and got a ridgid titanium at the Home Depot and I am happy with that one, its made by Freud in Italy."
4,Rip Capabilities of a combo blade,"This blade replaced a 24 tooth exclusive rip blade (Freud also, in the same price range). I can tell no significant difference in the quality and effort needed to rip maple. And it doesn't splinter cross grain plywood badly. Seems a good value."
4,table saw blade buy,"I mistakenly ordered this blade not noticing that it is full kerf. My saw is 13 amp, the advice is use a thin kerf blade. But I am very satisfied with the clean cuts. I've found no problems ripping 2 inch fir, it is noisier. One big plus, no wobble, so flatter cuts. The great price on this quality blade make this an exceptional buy."
4,Great Blade Great Price,"Sometimes you may think the more you pay the better the product but in saw blades that is not always true. I have paid major bucks for a high priced saw blade, want mention name here, but the Freud blades are less expense and do a markably better job cutting that the more expense blade.I just had to try the big buck blade one time and it does not mesaure up to the Freud blades I have. Save your money and look at the Freuds when it is time to buy saw blades.Rickf178"
5,Freud LM82M010,I find this blade to do an excellent job in my table saw. I have had many Freud blades in the blast and they have all been good.
4,a good primer,"This is not an America-bashing book, rather it is a sincere effort to bridge the gap between two dynamic cultures - secular Americanism & religious Islam, both, at this time, struggling to find common ground upon which to face a mutually lethal adversary - Islamic terrorism.UNDERSTANDING MUSLIM-WEST ALIENATION is a worthy primer, no bells & whistles, nothing fancy & eminently accessible for those wanting to know more about how we all got to this sorry state of affairs, where we might be going, & exactly what drives Muslim extremists to vilify the West."
3,womens Apex Conform shoe,"Womens Apex Taupe Conform Lace Comfort Shoe (Relieves Bunions, Hammertoes and other foot pain) Recommended for diabetes and arthritisThis shoe does not feel as good as the original version after Aetrex started changing the way it is made. I am so disappointed and have looked everywhere for the original version without the extra seams of the heel. Just doesn't feel the same or work as good...."
2,i WISH this book was about finding love and sex abroad,"What it's really about however, is a collection of miniscule stories which all start out interestingly enough and just when the climax (of the story) is about to happen the story either abruptly ends or completely fast forwards to the boring end. Boy arrives in new city. Boy sees girl. Boy begins to talk to girl. Girl invites boy back to her place. The End. If a complete lack of details and an abrupt ending right at the most interesting part get you going, then you'll award this book a Pulitzer."
1,KillDirt sent Miele S2120 Delphi not Miele S251i (Misleading),"We ordered a Miele S251i, to replace our old S251i (fantastic vacuum). KillDirt stated the Miele S251i was no longer made and they were going to replace our order with a Miele S2120 Delphi, which was portrayed as the ""upgraded model"" and KillDirt would give it to us for the same price. First, KillDirt is still advertising the Miele S251i, which is misleading. Second, KillDirt is selling the Delphi for the same price, therefore no ""deal"" was given. Lastly, the Delphi is not even close to an upgrade. The S251i is far superior: (a) it has 4 wheels instead of 3; (b) it has bumpers to protect the furniture; (c) the cord is longer; and (d) the canister held the accessories inside."
5,A Promise Fulfilled,"I fell in love with Tim Janis' music the very first time I heard it. I now am the proud owner of 24 CDs and DVDs. On the album THE PROMISE, there is a song with the same title. It is superb! One of the most beautiful I have ever heard. Between the penny whistle and the violins, and of course the beautiful arrangement......it is spellbinding! Of course, you can say that about MOST of Tim Janis' music. Relaxing, yes, and also very memorable."
4,Music for the soul,I bought this CD for one song...The Promise. It's moving piece that makes your heart sing. The entire album is wonderful and I highly recommend it.
2,I was not impressed by this book,"For a professor of history, this is an average book that is rather non-scholary. Apart from the appalling photo captioning and poor maps, the text is little more than a rehash of existing literature, adding little to the body of knowledge on the fall of Tobruk in 1942. I would have though that such an esteemed author would have had his work peer reviewed, but obviously not. For those already familiar with Tobruk and seeking a mediorce account- this is your book."
5,Excellent resource,"The Nikon D70/D70S DVD is an excellent resource for gaining additional information about the camera. Like a book, you can review all the information, or jump to certain sections for refresher info.This was a great purchase for me."
4,Should be included with the D70,"This DVD is a useful guide to Nikon's amazing D70. It demonstrates many of the practical uses of the D70's Exposure Modes, which lie beyond the automatic point-and-shoot settings. It also demonstrates the purpose of each knob and button. If you can't afford Nikon School, this DVD is reasonable alternative."
3,Pretty Good,Good video but wish it was a little more detailed and slower showing you how to work with your camera you do have to reveiw it over and over and you can go back to review it again later and learn something new. So over all I would say it help you start to understand your camera a lot better.
1,Poor picture quality,I found this dvd so difficult to watch that I ended up returning it. My dvd looked as if a video camera was set up on a tripod with the background in focus. The guy delivering the information was out of focus. I stopped watching after 30 minutes because my eyes couldn't take it anymore.
4,The Cards,"These cards, are simply the best. I bought this and got the best of it. The booster packs were fantastic and I even got Gate Guardian in a pack. Totally worth eighty bucks. Most deffinately.."
5,greatest ever,this is the best i now have an unstopable deck i finaly have exodias head all i need is the left arm and the right leg and i finaly have barrel dragon get this
4,I guess my 9-year-old should write this review...,"...because he was thrilled with this birthday present. I can't go wrong with Yu-Gi-Oh cards. And apparently, these were great. As a mom, I'm tired of picking up cards laying around the house, but that shouldn't count in a rating of this toy."
2,A poor design,The concept of this door latch is not a good one but I needed a replacement for one that broke. I had an issue with this product itself as I dropped it and it fell apart. I couldn't fiure out how it went back together even though there were only 3 parts I jury rigged it to get it to work.
1,Not very well made.,This can easily get stuck inside the housing if a little child pushes the catch in with their finger. Would NOT buy another!
5,Derash on Peshat and beyond,"Outstanding and difficult book. Accessible in large part to educated laypersons like myself. His argument really clarifies the stakes in holding the opposites of a deep belief in / experience of the reality of revelation mediated by Torah tradition, on the one hand, and a commitment to the ""just the facts"" perspective of contemporary secular science (hopefully not scientism), on the other hand."
1,Nothing Good To Say About This Movie,"This movie was one of the most unentertaining I've ever watched. Bad acting, no plot, no story line, no action, not funny. It looked like a low budget production. The set was drab and unrealistic looking. Even the fake beard on the Mortician looked like it was painted on.The movie is about a guy working in the morgue. The timeline for the movie looks like they are attempting to portray modern day. The morgue in this movie looks like early 1900s.The setting attempts to portray a large city urban area, however there is always a lack of people, sites,and sounds you would expect to see and hear in that type setting. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is ""it only ran for 90 minutes"".I ordered this movie in HD. That was a waste of two bucks. The poor shooting locations and drab background settings were not enhanced by HD."
1,Bad disc?,"The disc is advertised as ""All Regions"" but the audio does not play on my US (North America) DVD player. I could play it on my PC's optical drive, however."
2,a reviewer,The audio was great. The videos where horrible.The soundmix was out of sync in most of the videos. Not worth themoney. Better to buy the CD and sit back and enjoy themusic.
2,Money Making off ABBA fans,"I'll admit I'm fan enough to buy anything ABBA related. But as the viewer from Denmark states this disc is really poorly put together.Most annoying for a *music* DVD: the audio tracks should have been uncompressed PCM tracks but instead we get poor quality ""Dolby Digital"" tracks that sound like you're playing every song with the treble all the way up.The video is pixelated and soft. It certainly seems they skimped on the bitrate. Obvious flaws in the original videos have been left intact instead of being ""digitally restored""Best feature had to be the slide-show. Although they repeated many of the pictures the music and images set quite a mood and had me reminiscing.Overall though a shameful effort. It should have included more of the TV show videos featured on ""The Winner Takes it All"" DVD. Definitive collection my foot. It gets two stars only because of the music itself."
2,total disappointment,I would hav to be the biggest Aussie fan of AbbaI hav all the albums on cd an autographed pic the Abba Movie and front row seats at their 1977 Sydney Concert. I waited eagerly for this DVD which i purchased thru Amazon and it is so flawed with pixelling sound drops and frame freezes. Universal even realised this and will be re releasing it in a new format. Shame Shame Shame I even bought a copy here and its just as bad!!!
1,Horrible Quality,"As an ABBA fan I am pleased to see the videos put together, however the quality is really bad, it's probably the worst DVD I have seen! I guess Universal does not go for quality!!!"
5,DEFINITIVE ABBA,"THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION IS A GREAT DVD WITH A MIX OF ALL OF THEIR HITS TO A FEW LITTLE SPECIALTIES LIKE ""I KISSED THE TEACHER"". I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO THIS GROUP. WHEN THEIR FINAL ALBUM WAS RELEASED I DIDN'T LIKE MOST OF IT AT THE TIME BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT WE WERE SEEING A GROUP COME OF AGE. I THINK THIS WAS A GROUP WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIMES. ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF NEW SOUNDS. THE TECHNO BEAT AND SOUND ON THEIR FINAL CUTS ARE MAGNIFACENT.THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION FOR AVID ABBA FANS OR JUST CASUAL LISTENERS.THE DVD IS CLEAR AND AS COLORFUL AS THEIR COSTUMES. SOMETIME I LAUGH AT MYSELF FOR STILL LISTENING TO ABBA, FOR I AM OVER 50 YEARS OLD. THEY JUST MAKE ME FEEL SO GOOD. ABBA FOREVER!!"
3,Excuse me REMASTERED !?!?,Well the sound is no doubt remastered the video's on the other hand. Well u might as well listen to a CD remastered and look on a VHS/VCR video cuz the quality of the picture quality .... If u are a quality FREAK !!! If u are an ABBA Fan however.... who cares =) It sounds great !!! The rest is pure nostalgia.
5,LOVELY BAND,"I GREW UP ON ABBA, THEY ARE WONDERFUL THIS DVD CAPTURES ALL THE GREATEST HITS IF YOUR A FAN THIS IS A MUST"
2,disappointed disc,"This item has far too much nebulous background material which I did not like at all. I doubt that I will listen to it again.Thank you,John Cummins."
5,Abracadabra,"""ABBA:The Definitive Collection"" is a wonderful retrospective of ABBA videos, in chronological order from the early days to the later days. It is interesting, listening to the lip-synching or is it out of synch?, and watching the different costumes. To be fair, on some videos, the audio and video are in synch.The last video is actually a delightful, live performance of ""Dancing Queen"" for the Swedish Royalty.I am amazed on how exceptionally well the two Swedish ladies, Agnetha and Frida, sing, in regards to enounciation and pronounciation and in regards to clarity, in the English language. There are also a few songs in Spanish.So, take a journey to a time past, when ABBA was magical.P.S. If you want an analysis of the 35 videos, please refer to Rocky Raccoon's review, dated July 28, 2008."
5,Great,"Lot of fun of course! Along with the music, I love the incredible costumes, choreography, and scenery. The clarity of the videos is not great, but that's understandable."
4,How To Make a Music Video,"The songs on this DVD are very clear and the best collection of ABBA songs around. The videos overall are comical since the steps and production appear so scripted. None the less, the videos are very entertaining if you are a true ABBA fan."
4,ABBA Lover,"This exactly what the title says, It's a comprehensive presentation of ABBA songs with excellent photography. I'm glad I bought it."
4,Amazing Video,"A super collection including almost all known Abba songs. Video editing is superb, and the DVD brings a lot of memories of that 70's and 80's episode. So, stop listening, and watch live.Again, like many other great music DVD's, It will be perfect if the sound was remastered to Dolby digital 5.1 and DTS ( sound format is Dolby 2.0)."
3,abba arrival,at last after waiting ages for this release i finaly got it in my hands. the pacaging was quite nice aswell as the price reasonable. the picture quality is brilliant and the sound tremendous. to say that the songs were made all those years ago. the problems are that at times the sound doesn't match the picture. i hope someone is made to pay for this. at one point on waterloo frida's mouth is going ten to the dozen when the song is instrumental. obviously these tapes have got in the wrong hands for remastering. where are the lyrics terry
1,Horrible quality,"I've bought this DVD from Amazon. But If I have a opportunity to preview this DVD I would never bought it. Picture is foggy, sound is unclear. A lot of the clips are out of sync. It is worst DVD I ever seen. Everybody makes a mistake. My mistake is purchasing this DVD."
5,Matt Hughes is my new favorite UFC Fighter!,"I didn't know much about Matt Hughes considering that I've only been following the UFC for a little over a year now. However, coming from a strong wrestling upbringing, whenever someone is slammed or power-bombed in the Octagon I almost **** myself. This is the kind of fighter that sells tickets and brings in the casual/new MMA fan like myself. Aside from Rampage in his Pride fighting, it's not very often that you see such good wrestling in MMA. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Many styles done very well.,"Cool blend of funk, old skool hip-hop, with some 80's dance loops thrown in to start the album off with, it all flows very nicely. Then gears shift into sweet blends of groovey, soulful house. Tons of energy on this album, from start to finish, cool beats and breaks, I definitely reccomend."
2,Don't pay more than you'd pay for a paperback.,"First of all, it isn't a Mathematica package; it's a crippled version of Mathematica plus content organized as help files. If you're not a Mathematica user and don't intend to be, this will be a puzzling combination for you. If you ARE a Mathematica user, you'll be frustrated that you can't import the content and evaluate it in Mathematica; nor can you work in the Explorer, with standard functions and packages you're used to. Inevitably you'll want to EXPLORE something that these limitations makes impossible. Don't waste your money."
1,Are you Kidding?!,"I was sent a envelope which contained a plastic bag with powder inside. I ask again ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" How do you use the product? Did you think to include instructions? Is this how this product is normally packaged? And if it is; ""CHANGE THE WAY YOU SHIP THIS PRODUCT""! This could be anything other than what you advertised. Truly disappointed! Response required!"
