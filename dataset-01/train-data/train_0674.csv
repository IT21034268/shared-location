3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"When I started reading this book, my expectations were very high. I really thought I would be rating this book a five. But, as I go close to the end I realized the story was not as interesting as I thought. Therefore I gave it three stars wich is something I don't often do. This is my first time rating a book three stars.I don't think some of the characters were well developed. The character nate ford who was responsible of killing her family was not mentioned at the end at all. I thought the end was too quiet. I was expecting more action at the end.Being that this was the authers first book, I think I might give it a second chance and read his next book entitled ""THE BIG MANGO"""
3,Fine For Most But Know The Details,"This TV had a great picture and pretty decent sound. I picked it up for a really good deal on Black Friday and loved it with one major exception. If you are going to use this TV for ""over the air"" reception be forewarned that it will not output the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound through the optical or coaxial outputs. I use over the air so this was a deal breaker for me. I made several calls and spent LOTS of time, mainly on hold, with Olevia only to find out they don't have a clue what they are talking about. After the first call the set was returned for another and it did the same.I've had another Olevia TV with other problems but it output the DD 5.1 fine. If you're using cable or satellite you should not have this problem, just hook directly to the receiver from your cable/satellite box and don't worry about the TV output. If you just want ""stereo"" instead of surround you can also get that from the output as PCM."
5,Cant Find a Better One For the Price,"OK let me start out by saying that once i decided i wanted to spend alot of money on a tv, i for sure did my homework on it. and the Olevia 42"" 242t was on sale at Office Depot. I bought i over a year ao and it has worked perfectly ever since. No problems and no complaints from me. have it now hooked up to surround sound, xbox, ps2, and all and it still works great. Even leave it on at night sometimes for over a year and screen is still like the day i bought it. get one"
5,1 Day Old And I'm Impressed,"I just got the tv a day ago and i must say that I'm impressed. At first I thought a 42"" would be a little too big for my living room, but this thing sits perfect. I haven't hooked up my HD yet, but the satellite picture is way better than I thought it would be. The sound isn't even all that bad like some of the reviews stated on other forums. The room its in is 18x15 and its loud enough, but I'm still going to hook up a surround sound for the theater effect. My brothers came by yesterday to watch the all-star game and they couldn't stop saying how nice it looked. I'll update this review in the weeks to come to see if the tv is performing the same. All I can say is for $983($799 before 2 yr. extended warranty which I recommend and taxes, can somebody say Fair Tax) this is a great deal for a 42"" lcd hdtv that broadcasts at up to 1080i."
1,Misleading Title!,"This is NOT about administration or development using JBoss, it is about the architecture and development of JBoss itself.That said, if you want to know WHY JBoss works the way it works this would be a decent book. If you want to know HOW to use it this will be worse than useless."
1,Poor choice if you want to learn how to develop on JBoss,"Pages 351 to 389 walk you through the process of building and deploying a simple application using JBoss. The remainder of this 500 page book discusses JBoss internals.If you're wanting to get a quick start on building J2EE applications on JBoss, this is not the book for you."
2,Did anyone proof-read this thing?,"This book is a mess. It is rife with typos and confusing grammatical errors. Diagrams are cut off and/or poorly laid out.This would be forgivable if the overall content hit the spot. However, as another reviewer noted, the main focus is on the internals of JBoss, not on how to use it. Ultimately, that's the biggest disappointment."
3,Fairly good JBoss internals tutorial,"This is a useful book - unfortunately, it has the wrong title. This book is a ""JBoss Internals"" training course presented as a book. Full of interesting information, but very little on how you go about developing, deploying and administrating a J2EE application with JBoss. Still, a useful buy for any JBoss user - if nothing else, because there's no alternative!"
4,Little strange book but better than nothig,JBoss documentation is fair. I would recommend to get this book because it's only documentation available for JBoss. I bought PDF file from jboss website online instead of book - recommend you to do the same. They sale also clustering docs as well..
4,Keeping Up Appearances -,"Who could not love Hyacinth and her quirky but hilarious family? If you don't laugh, you are unconscious or worse!"
4,scary,This is a video about what happned to some employees from Disney who were laid off. This one is pretty scary and really changes the way you will look at the Disney institution!
1,A disaster movie if ever there was one,"This film was not only a waste of time and money, but the acting and dialogue was unbelievably diabolical. I just couldnt believe how this film ever was released. At one point I actually thought they had frozen Debra Paget's face, it was just RIGID with some words coming out of her mouth.The sound and quality of the DVD matched its acting - extremely bad to say the least. It was a total waste of money on my part, and I certainly would not recommend it unless you are THAT keen.I enjoy watching anything to do with ancient Egypt, but this film was torture to me and it goes straight into the bin."
1,BAD,"She can't play the piano! At least she should study more to correct the wrong notes, it sounds like a bad seight-reading, forget the musical phrases or thoughts. Empty, no working brain throughout, and I see no reason for such a CD to be releazed to the public. No body feels shame these days! Unfortunatelly the minimum I could put was one star, but I feel even this is over the rating. ""Creme de la creme?"" I don't think so!For the one who is wondering where she has been hidden, I dissagree. My wondering is WHY she is not hidden anymore?"
1,trina's a dirty rapper,"I listened to a few samples of trina's songs off her album and I couldnt believe the trash she was saying which is mostly about sex, money, men, hoes and b*tches. I think her music is much too dirty and unhealthy to be listening to."
4,Squirrel Guard,"I had another squirrel guard on the 4x4 post that my feeders hang from and it did not work. This one does. No squirrel has gotten around it. However, be aware that it will not stop raccoons and manufacturer does not claim that it will - best way to get rid of them is to live trap and relocate them."
3,Doesn't quite fit right,"Square peg in a round hole. When I looked at it I knew I would need something to close the gaps because I think that a snake would still be able to worm it's way through, so I used vet wrap. Burlap strips or an ace bandage would work just as well. All in all it looks good and I'm happy with it, we will see what happens when the ducks move in."
3,"Great Price, Does what it is supposed to, one flaw",Prevents squirrels from climbing into the bird feeder.Kinda funny watching it happen actually.Easy to install but with a slight bump on it the overlapped metal edges that meet pop out easily.They go right back in but it is annoying when mowing around it.Noticed slight rusting as well.These are more expensive at the local stores and good luck finding one this cheap or at all at the big home retailers.
3,Not for Men,"The girl in this video was way out of my range. I have bass range. I tried following along one two octaves below.The example student sings flat a lot, which seems to be common problem with sopranos. Anne helped with this problem by providing useful advice. I don't have that problem so much. I have other problems I'm working on that were not discussed here.I would have liked a video that is more inspiring and enthusiastic. I like to see a powerful performer who has a rich tone.The exercises were presented only briefly. I would liked to have seen the exercises performed all the way through by an exemplary pro (a rich bass, ideally).The exercises and practice routine could have been presented a lot more thoroughly.I would have liked Anne to speak to me (the viewer) more.I was a little disappointed. I found this video to be a little uninspiring and not suited for me. It was well thought-out, though, and I might recommend it for beginner female voice students."
4,fascinating but don't know that i can swallow it,"Corcoran is a materialist Christian. That means he doesn't believe we have a soul in the classic Christian view of soul. It doesn't mean we are merely animals either. I do love how it makes the resurrection of the body which Paul so emphasizes imperative. I don't know if his way is the only way to get there, nor is it his prime motivation for holding the view. An insightful read that will definitely leave you with questions about your assumptions."
5,"Also known as ""Cider with Rosie""","I checked this book out of my public library thinking it was a collection of stories in addition to ""Cider with Rosie"". It is not.According to the book itself, ""The Edge of Day"" is the title for the first American edition of ""Cider with Rosie"". The only glaring difference between ""Cider"" and ""Edge"" is that in ""Edge"" Mr. Lee names his brothers and sisters in his dedication, while in ""Cider"" he simply writes ""to my brothers and sisters the whole and the half""."
4,Good basic plates,"Purchased along with salad plates. Nice and sturdy Would have liked them a bit ""bright/whiter"", and perhaps an inch bigger, but overall very good quality for the price."
5,"very nice plates, especially for the price!","I really like these plates, good quality, solid, and look very nice. Nobody seeing these would suspect they're so low priced. Wouldn't hesitate to buy more."
2,The road pro,The road pro I was very mad about this product it don't read the right temp inside or out. Its all ways 10 to 20 degrees off at all times. The only thing that works is the clock
1,Quit your day job Jesus !!,I have listened to this CD and have come to one conclusion...He is better off singing Ranchero music. I gave it one star because the site won't let me give it anything less. His Salsa singing leaves alot to be desired. His lyrics fell forced and there is no passion when he sings the lyrics. It's no wonder he has never hit it big.
2,Not the classic I remembered...,"As a child I thought ""Ulysses"" was a great movie. So was my opinion of the original Godzilla, and Rodan, etc. Sadly, after ordering the DVD, I quickly realized that a child sees things through different eyes than does an adult. The cyclops scene was the only excitement worth noting (despite a terrible makeup job on the cyclops). The film is basicaly a big letdown. The sound and picture quality are very poor; a lot of static in the sound and a picture that sorely needs to be remastered and cleaned up. The film offers 3 language choices (English, Italian, and French) but there are no subtitle options or extras. For the selling price ""Ulysses"" might not be a terrible film, but it isn't the classic that I remember it being either. Buy it if you must, but you were forewarned."
1,Poorly made DVD copy of a classic,"This DVD copy is poorly done. The original movie was in glorious color. This DVD was done ""on the cheap."" Colors are muddy. The sound quality is also poor - the music is distorted in parts. When the movie was originally dubbed into English for US release, it may have satisfied audiences in the 1950s (as it did me when I first saw it back then!), but it is time to re-dub every actor's lines except for Kirk Douglas. Every other voice on the DVD sounds flat and tinny. The voices sound almost the same for all of the male characters.Step one: Get a good master copy of the film and have the DVD recording rescanned. Then re-dub the dialogue. THEN, put the new Ulysses up for sale. Until then, buyer beware!"
1,Ulysses is a great disappointment.,"Ulysses takes great literature and reduces it to mundane, baddly acted drama that even a young Kirk Douglas could not save. Dubbed, baddly acted and written it reduces classic literature to mundane run of the mill class ""B"" film making. This Movie has no redeeming qualitites."
1,Ulysses,"The movie, as I remember is great. But the DVD I received is for region 1 and I am in region 4 so I can not review the quality of the movie."
4,Ulysses,"If you're a fan of old school adventure, with good acting this is the one for you. A true classic and a lot better than the Ulysses movies offered today."
4,Ulysses,"This movie I first saw as a teenager, and I always loved this movie for two reasons (Kirk Douglas and Sylvano Mangano) . It is one of my favorite movies."
4,Ulysses,"UlyssesI am sorry to say that Kirk Douglas & Anthony Quinn and a few extras are the only decent actors in the whole movie. The first time I saw it I was extremely disappointed. I think I was expecting another ""The Vikings"" or ""Spartacus"". However, I watched the movie again to night and saw an entirely different movie. The scenery was outstanding and the costumes beautiful. Kirk Douglas showed so many sides of his acting ability. He was able to switch to so many different characters that made up Ulysses.This movie is a keeper and I know I will watch it many times."
3,Kirk Douglas as Ulyses,This was obviously a lower budget project; Kirk was not able to shine as he did in Sparticus or the Vikings. But I am glad I added it to my video collection.
4,Hokey but true to the spirit of the Odyssey,"I know Leonard Maltin dumped on this title, and while it is ""hokey"" with poor special effects, in the end it is much more 'true' in its story telling to Homer's poem than the recent ultra fancy special effects laden Armand Assante ""Odyssey"" flick. Kirk Douglas's Ulysses is passionate and fiery and Anthony Quinn does well as Antilochus. Compare Armand Assante's sleep-walking performance killing the suitors at the climax of ""Odysseus"" to Kirk Douglas's bending of the bow, shot through the axe-heads, and his revelation to the suitors (along w/ Zeus's thunder as in the poem) and it's obvious which film is the more moving. High tech visuals are nice but not required in the telling of this tale...just good passionate actors."
2,dubbed,"Loved this movie as a young boy. Hate it now as an adult. Had I known it was dubbed in English I wouldn't have bought it. The bad acting, efx could've lived with that. But the dubbing made it seem like I were watching one of the Shaw Bros. Kung fu movies."
2,Good action packed story,"Kirk Douglas was great in his hey day, a very good story, received this movie in a timely manner, thank you very much. I thought I had ordered Spartacas & got Ulysses instead."
2,Not Good for Class,"I taught the book Ulysses in my class of lower-level freshmen. When reading the book, the students were somewhat able to understand, with a lot of pausing and explanation. However, attempting to watch this movie just did not work. The fact that they were speaking in Italian and the English subtitles were relatively small, made for an all-around challenging experience.I'm not speaking to the fact that the movie itself is not good, however, it may not work for all settings."
4,What a Movie!!,I purchased this movie to show my class of 6th graders while we were studying Greek mythology. They LOVED it!!
4,dorie,i saw this movie 15 years ago. its more realistic than jason and the argonauts. it has a good story line. i am glad to own it on dvd.
2,Doesn't go with the flow!,"I bought this book because I enjoy David Catrow's wonderfully vivid illustrations. For a book with a delightful message to match, please see ''Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon'' a must-read for any child struggling with self-acceptance. Elizabeth Spurr's writing in this book, however, stutters and starts...flowing and rhyming on one page then reaching on another. It's not half as fun to read as I'd hoped."
5,"wonderful book, a must buy",i bought this book and i am very much pleased with it. its really practical and helps to develop personality of each of the cards which is very necessary. i definitely recommend this book to everyone
5,The BEST Tarot Book for Newbies,"I had purchased 3 or 4 books on tarot before finding this one. It is by far the best. Don't buy any other books until you get this one. It has an easy to read format with enough detail to keep you interested without getting confusing.There's a great section on querent question forming and keyword charts for each of the 78 cards. It also contains lessons, with answers, where you can test your insights. An invaluable tool for anyone interested in learning the art of tarot reading."
5,Great Book but all information is free online,"I bought this book thinking it would add on to her online version, found at learntarot.com . It sadly has the exact same information, except the website is easier to use. I suggest you save your money and do the lessons as outlined on her website, where one click will bring up all the information for each given card rather than flipping through a book back and forth.Great information though!"
5,Best Beginners Book Bar None!!,"This is as close to perfect as it gets. A MUST HAVE for starting out and goes really well with 78 Degrees of Wisdom and Paul Foster Case's book A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages. (Three best books on the market.)Readable, concise, extremely insightful and keywords perfect for internalizing meanings. NO OTHER BEGINNERS BOOK IS EVEN IN THE BALLPARK!!!"
4,Great as a first book,"Learning the Tarot is great as my first book on tarot, covering the basics informatively without being longwinded. I also liked how the author chose to be a lot more fair-minded with card meanings. I find that a lot of interpretations of cards online and elsewhere are basically DOOM DOOM DOOM. Bunning chooses to supply both positive and negative aspects of the cards most of the time and allows the reader to find their own interpretation depending on the spread or situation at hand. The only reason this book didn't get five stars is because I'm slightly put off by how the book is structured. There's a lot of jumping around to be done and the sections don't seem to be organized in a productive way.Otherwise, I was very pleased with it as a starter book and am definitely looking forward to delving into different aspects of tarot."
3,"Okay, but too confusing and hard for beginners","This tarot book had nice pictures of the 78 cards, and great key meaning charts, but overall, it was too confusing for a beginner like me. The meanings for the 22 major arcana cards were too lengthy, and there weren't any reversed card meanings. I wouldn't buy this book if I were you, but if it was cheaper, maybe. QL"
2,readabily,the book is easy to read and is clear. but because of my first time of this nature of material it is the first information so i have no idea to compare too. It is written for easy learning.Linda
3,New to tarot,"New to tarot looking for a decent book, so I took a shot on this one. I'm not crazy of the format however."
5,Joan is Cl;ear with her lesson plan,I previewed this book and was very pleased with its step by step process to learning the Tarot.
4,Nice book for Beginners!,"This is a good book that really helped me to read tarot cards. I would also recommend ""How To Perform A Psychic Reading - A Beginner's Guide To Reading Tarot Cards"" as an excellent starting point for beginners."
5,Wonderful book. No kidding.,"Wow! This book is amazingly clear and inspiring. The easy, step-by-step lesson format is delightful. The meanings-at-a-glance keywords are enormously helpful (your eye usually beelines right to the exact keyword you need to see). Other books give you long-winded essays souped up with every symbol in the known universe. And then they throw in the Archetype of the Kitchen Sink, too, just for good measure. Such writers mean well, but their books are too often vague and chatty - something like Tarot for Politicians. This book, on the other hand, gives you brilliant discussions that are focused, practical and down-to-earth. I'm no expert, by the way. But I've read plenty of books on Tarot, some of them very good (I'm thinking here of Pollack). This one, however, is quite simply the best of them all. You can't go wrong with this selection."
5,Wonderful Book For Someone New To Tarot,I am new to Tarot and purchased the Universal Waite Tarot Cards and this book. What a joy it has been to learn the tarot. I also purchased a couple other tarot books not knowing which one would turn out to be the most helpful. This is it!! The other books told me very little or were confusing in the explainations. I highly recommend this book to anyone new to tarot. Excellant and easy instructions. Don't even bother buying any other books on tarot...your search is over with this book.
3,Direct and user-friendly...,"I have just finished going through the ""lesson"" portion of this book, and found it to be one of the more direct and accessible of the tarot books I have used. In general, the author skips new-age jargon and would-be-psychobabble to get to the point. I particularly like her emphasis on the process of card interpretation; she suggests a way (without claiming it is ""the only way"") that makes for logical and easily-remembered connections between the cards. My only caveat was that the book's pages and/or binding began to come apart with very little use. Still, the content and her thoughtful interpretive methods were above-par."
3,Bringing back my childhood,Simply love the old rhymes I listened to as a child on Play School like the Ning Nang Nong. I purchased this book so I could read it to the kids I help at school and so my own kids could read it. Nonsense verse will assist the school kids to make up their own Fractured Fairy Tales in writing lessons.
3,A Mediocer Revival!,"This compilation celebrates the Mod Revival of 79'-83' in a incompleate way. The CD is missing the scene's top 3 bands....the Jam, Squire, and Secret Affair. Although I have to give it props for showing these ""Jam wanna-bes"" all on one CD that are never played on the radio....ever! I would only recomend this CD to the really dedicated mod fans. These bands sound as if they were Oi bands that simply got into the Mod Revival craze. Sure...there are some really good tracks on this album like the uplifting intro of ""Opening Up"" by the Circles, the dancer's anthem ""Can We Go Dancing"" by the Amber Squad, and the pumped up R&B/Punk melodies of ""On the Streets Again"" by Long Tall Shorty, but overall this compilation fails to show us a decent look at the WHOLE revival. I would recomend the compilation ""On Target"" for anyone who is interested on the 2nd Wave Mod scene. Thank You."
4,Stiff fabric but great cut,"these oxford boxers are quite stiff but the cut of the fabric is top notch.these are the best fitting boxers ive come across (6'0"" 180lbs) they fit slimly but dont cut off circulation to my junk nor do they ride up my buttcrack. i however prefer the Jos A Banks more due to the softness of their material4/5"
5,Must read!,"A Fine Balance is undoubtedly Mistry's best book so far. It triggered a myriad of emotions and is hard to put down. Almost a year after reading it, I am still pondering over the events that unfolded in this novel. It realistically portrays the lives of four people of diverse backgrounds and different lifestyles, who, at the same time, have a lot in common. I don't know of a single person who has read this book and hasn't enjoyed it."
3,Honest,"This is a long, well-written tale of India; but too depressing. I felt I spent too much of my time reading the 602 pages and then had to feel so awful."
4,"More like ""A Fine Imbalance""...","Ah, where to start?! I'll keep it simple. Interesting, albeit slightly haphazard story; very well written, BUT much too bleak..."
5,I loved it!,I could not put the book down! It is an easy read with interesting characters. You will appreciate the simple things in life after reading this book. I will read more from this author.
3,HelCris,"Good reading althought, as others reviews state, too much suffering, excessive tragedies, and when you think it is over, Mistry finds something even worse for his characters. It looks like the is NO balance afterwards, not even a ""fine"" balance. It's all too sad."
2,Too terribly sad,"I loved this book up until about half way through. It was such a pleasure to read about the characters. They were so interesting. But their sad situations got worse and worse, culminating in a most horrible tragedy that had me sobbing as I finished the book. A well written story but too depressing and utterly sad."
3,"When bad things happen they ""all"" happen to just two people?","Just above average. My god, how could all the bad things happen just two people...this was so amazing. I mean he tried all the way to create the Indian in that era, but for gods sake was this how all villagers turned out to be. I thought it to be amazing, it really was just okay. I read the book more out of curiosity, but was disgusted by the end of it. Lack of characters was a problem and Mistry just burdened the ones he had tremendously. Please...have a heart those two did not deserve to be so demolished by life."
4,Is this for real,"I am very interested in indian culture and have enjoyed various books with and without the ""magical"" elements (i forget what its called). However, I had a little trouble believing that things could really be that bad there - i.e., the forced sterilization, ""leaders"" running villages and exacting revenge for no good reason (thakur), the abuse of the lower castes, etc. can someone please tell me this novel exaggerated those abuses - please!?!!?"
3,"Good start and middle, disappointing and depressing end","The book starts of well, and maintains a finely balanced tone till the middle, after which the author seems to become overwhelmed by the negativity of life and starts driving his characters from one crisis to another till they all end up in the worst situations imaginable. The end result serves to only depress the reader, which is why the book gets just 3 stars. The book could have tried to answer some of the issues it raises, but in the end it simply focusses on describing the minutiae of each character's daily existence and magnifying the (aparent) hopelesses of living. Also to be noted is the fact that the events in this book are more than 25-30 years old, and things are vastly different in present-day India."
2,heavy!,Beyond heavy ... not on my list of recommended reading...you keep hoping for a turn for the better yet it never happens!It is yet an educational glance at the state of affairs in India in the 70's...Has it gotten better since then?berenice
5,An Indian Tapestry,"I'd like to compare this book to a quilt, since Dina Dalal crafts one during the story, but I felt it was more of a tapestry. The comparison to Charles Dickens seemed very appropriate. Throughout the book, the characters took turns being developed and enmeshed, much like the threads that compose a tapestry.This was a welcome change to Midnight's Children, which I also read. This book did an excellent job of defining the culture and events of the time. I learned more about the caste system than I wanted to, as well as the corruption of the period.Although it's a long book, that was part of its allure - I was happy to be able to continue reading about the four main characters and see what they were going through."
5,Great Historical Fiction,"If you enjoy historical fiction, this book is for you. Mistry does a fantastic job of depicting the class strugles that have existed within India during the past 75 years. A great book."
4,Life is what we fill it with....,"This author wrote a compelling story on 4 main characters. I tend to like reading books that teach lessons or leave something behind providing hope. This did neither. The author was great at captivating the audience and I felt as if I was in the story. I read this in 4 days in my evenings, hoping, and hoping,... only to feel jilted by hope. If you want inspiration, do not read. If you want truth or a true story line, read. This story depicts realism, as well, sadly but true... makes you realize the fortunes in your own life (health, freedoms, and family) I recommend as a personal growth lesson, but not as a ""pick-me-up"" (better to stick with the Sound of Music for that!)"
5,A Fine Balance Indeed,"What do you get when you combine the character development of a Dickens' novel with the suffering and oppression of a modern day society? 'A Fine Balance' is just such a combination. From the first chapter, the reader is drawn to the characters that Mistry so elegantly paints and shapes for us. The misery and small successes of their day to day lives are described in such great detail, that by the end of the novel, the reader feels many of the same emotions as the characters. Mistry has created a cast in such a manner that we all can share in the heartache of living in India during the turbulent 1970s. This is an unknown gem that should be read by all."
4,"The balance tilts, in Mistry's favor","Yes, it does require a fine balance, between hope and despair, between good and evil, and between writing about scrounging beggars and peeping into the psyche of well to do businessmen. And Mistry has mastered this art of balance with amazing dexterity. His descriptions are so graphic that you could see the characters leaping out of the pages right in front of you. Quite a pity that people not familiar with the political history, language and lifestyles of the Indian subcontinent might find themselves at a loss to understand the finer points, but then, as one of the characters in the novel says, ""Loss is part and parcel of that necessary calamity called life."" Brilliant piece of work. One word of caution though. People who get bouts of depression very easily are advised to stay away from the book."
4,"Tough, but Engaging","I had a hard time putting this book down, though it was hard to take at times. The lives of the characters was so brutal, yet their determination to survive was inspiring."
3,Incredibly sad story with even sadder ending,"I actually thought the book was very interesting. However you should know what you are getting yourself into with this book. It is an incredibly sad story with an unbelievably sad ending. You should know it will make you cry, question human nature, and parts of it will basically ruin your day. I'm just saying--you have been warned."
3,It not an easy read,"This book goes into detail and gives you a clear picture of what life was like for the lower castes in India in the mid 1970's. i struggled with the idea of balance in this story because on the whole things did not get better for them. In the end, the only balance I saw was in the people who took the bad with the good and kept on trying while being thankful for what little good came their way. At least they recognized it!"
3,"Too depressing for me, but excellent writing","I like to be uplifted from books and this one was brutal in its portrayal of low caste Indians, though it may be telling it like it is. The writer is extraoridinalirly gifted and very creative as a weaver of tales. I kept hoping the characters would get a break, to no avail. This book would be a good one to use in prison to teach compassion or for everyday people who are lacking in that area. I noticed-- one reviewer wrote of becoming enlightened to human seffering from reading the book. I'm already a bleeding heart though."
5,No happy endings here,"This is a book about relationships and trust. One could cloyingly say it is about the human spirit but it is simply about 4 people, living in times that make trust nearly impossible. The characters are utterly absorbing and the descriptions of life in a caste system are compelling. It is not a happy novel, it is instead deeply disturbing. But Mistry stunningly transports his reader to this place, inside the lives of these people where you smell the smells, feel their pain, and search for a way to find meaning in their lives. This book is painful, but it deserves to be read."
1,Huh?,"Sorry, couldn't get through this one....lost my interest in the first chapter and reading each paragraph was like trying to decipher the Russian language."
2,"whiney, useless","i couldn't get through the first half. it was that whiney and babyish.remember, this is the guy who cried racism in the airports, when everybody knows people who fly with one way tickets get more survailence than most. it's that kind of non-thinking whining you can expect from this guy."
5,The most incredible 603 pages I've ever read!,"I finished it yesterday, and I'm still thinking about Ishvar and Omprakesh. I still find it hard to believe that what these two gentlemen went through could possibly have happened in 1975 India.I will cherish this book for a very long time!"
5,"In all respects, a terrific work.","_A Fine Balance_ is one of the most cinematic novels I've come across, but in its current state (and this is a compliment), it would make poor fodder for a Hollywood adaptation. While too huge for the screen, the book fits its 700-odd pages wonderfully. Mistry has written a broad story, and has employed an amazing perceptive ability to draw very rich, very real characters. He's also quite instructive: the book teaches about Indian politics, ethnic rivalries, civil corruption, and human resiliance, but it does its work all within the context of the novel's story and people. _A Fine Balance_ was recommended to me, and I've been doing my best to pass the favor onto anyone who'll listen!"
3,Didn't live up to my expectations...,"The main characters created such a reliable and loving relationship in the flat. It really disappointed me that this wasn't a ""happily ever after"" type of book."
4,Can't help it,"Mistry himself is a winner, far from any of the stuff here. He probably made enough money from his books to make sure he never goes back.To run a country with 1.2 billion some sacrifices must be made. The chief characters in this book are expendable."
2,One of the most depressing books that I have read,"This is one of the most depressing books that I have read in a long long time. The main characters in this story go though one trouble after another for seemingly no reason. In fact they hardly have anything good going for them. Surprisingly they behave really well for their circumstances.People unfamiliar with India may believe that this is the norm, which isn't true. This is a fictious story created by amalgamating the worst conditions possible for different people into the lives of all the characters of this book.The story about the beggar master having a step brother is one of the most dramatic fiction created to bring out some more NEGATIVITY."
2,"Oh, come on!","I obviously missed the point of A Fine Balance. Other readers here have raved about how this novel captures ""that fine balance between hope and sorrow,"" etc., but what I read was an incredibly depressing story about a few characters with hopeless lives who are subject to endless acts of pain. In the beginning it wasn't so bad -- I thought, ""Okay, here are a few nasty things that these characters have to deal with. It's all part of the character and plot development."" But IT NEVER ENDS, and eventually any progress that the characters or the story actually achieve comes crumbling down under the weight of the ridiculous events that the characters are made to endure. Near the end, I started skipping the acts of torture out of sheer annoyance. I wish someone would enlighten me about what really makes this book so wonderful."
5,Just READ it!,"There really isn't much that I can say which has not been said already by previous reviewers. But, I just wanted to add my voice to the many others in exclaiming over the brilliance and sensitivity of the author, Rohinton Mistry. Reading the book is like listening to an old and humble friend speak...without airs or any sort of pretentiousness. The characters were not just memorable but they struck me as actually being real. The ending did indeed break my heart but I think it was needed because Maneck was never able to maintain a fine balance. I would definately read it again and I urge anyone who has not read the book to do so. It was an unforgettable experience, which, for me has also been a beautiful one."
4,curious,I don't tend to analyse a writer while I'm absorbing a story unless their style is distracting...but I'm really stunned that I read 600 pages of horrors and couldn't put it down. Mr. Mistry makes you want to know his characters and care what happens to them even while it's breaking your heart.
3,Do you liked to be depressed?,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, and had also heard it was one of Oprah's recommendations.Although this book is wonderfully written and paints a realistic picture of India in the 1970s, it was horribly depressing and gets worse as the story goes on.By the time I reached the end of the book, I was so depressed, I was bawling my eyes out.The few good things that I gained from this book was knowledge of India in the 1970s, of which I had none; and I was extremely grateful for the life I have.Compared to the characters in the book, I feel like I won the lottery of charmed lives."
2,"IF YOU LIKE READING ABOUT MUTILATION,","starvation, hopelessness, mistreatment, and abuse, then you will love this book. It makes Les Miserables seem light and fun.I appreciated the skillful writing and learned a lot about India but towards the end of the book, I was thinking to myself, what the hec else can happen to these people?? And, sure enough, worse things kept coming. Became rather funny in a sick way."
2,waste of 600 pages !!,"This is by far the worst book i have ever read !! I would never compare this to the ""Kite Runner"" because that book was a wonderful journey for me. But this was a series of ""3 steps forward, 4 steps backward"" with every character ! And never did any of the character reach any of their goals or dreams....how depressing !! What a waste of time... I kept hopeful throughout the book that in the end they all would be fortunate enough to rise above all the tragedies in their life and not one of them ever did...."
1,Unbalanced,"As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table. Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.""A Fine Balance"" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601). By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel."
5,walking the tightrope,"Rohinton Mistry's masterpiece was a breeze to read and all in all, a sorrowful weave to absorb. It's a story that will stay with you, even long after you've put down the book. This is one book you want to get your hands on and have in your personal collection."
1,"1 star might be harsh, but...","I feel that I need to balance the scale a bit (There are way too many 5-star ratings for this book!). Mistry is a fine writer who creates memorable characters with great depth...however, this book left me utterly numb. I've read books about sad, depressing subjects before (i.e., other Oprah books), but Mistry definitely takes the prize. As one reviewer puts it ""...what the hec else can happen to these people?? And, sure enough, worse things kept coming. Became rather funny in a sick way."" This is absolutely my thought. I can remember coming to work while reading this book and telling my officemate the latest misery. He was so amused that to this day he still asks me about the beggarmaster. I'm amazed to see that so many people enjoyed this book. To each their own...."
3,The rain falls on everyone/,"I was very pleased with the way the author brought to life the chase system of India.Throughout the whole book I found myself begging the author, please, just please let the lives of these people turn out happy. Let there be something that would make me walk away from this book thinking that perhaps there is something fair and equitable about humanity.The author spent so much time bringing you into the charecter, making you feel like you were living, breathing, feeling what they were going through. So in the end when each charector lost everything, it felt like I had given up something for them as well."
1,Depressing!!!!!!!!,"I was pleased to read about the political history of India, but that's as far as pleasure went with this book. What a depressing story. I kept waiting to see if hope would arise but the poor characters kept getting knocked down by life and by extremely selfish and evil people. This is not a book to read if you are looking for a positive or uplifting story line. I realize every other reviewer loved this book, but it depressed the heck out of me."
1,No Fine Balance Here,"Mistry's ability to interweave several heart-breaking stories in detail is prodigious. However, looking for balance is a relentless grind -- this novel is entirely too long, depressing and bereft of hope, despite the 'fine balance' between hope and despair it purports to represent. The concluding chapters are especially contrived and frankly, unbelievable. The story grinds to a halt in much the same inexcusable way as A Man in Full, leaving this reader especially vexed at wasting so much time reading it. The attempt to associate this tale with Balzac's Pere Goriot is hubristic at worst, wishful thinking at best."
2,Is there a plot?,"I give this book 2 stars only because the author has some skills in the craft of writing (but not as a novelist. There is no plot, no theme, no message (unless you count hopelessness). The book is depressing, miserable and endless. It is also unecessarily scatological and gross. Believe me I can read ugly and miserable as well as the next reader if there is some point to it but I sure couldn't find it. Sorry."
3,"The style of ""a delicate balance"" by R. Mistry","The book describes a very violent epoch in recent Indian history and makes for some gripping reading. However the book is fairly sloppily written. The author uses indian words and phrases and lets the reader guess their meaning. Furthermore I felt that the author does not really know India firsthand, too often he describes scenes which sound as if they happen in Manchester or Birmingham, the way people talk, how they interact and what they do. There must be better books about India"
1,Mistry has a lot to learn,"I agree with the reader who offered ""Nectar In A Sieve"" as an antidote to this book. Sad, but poetically written. About F.B., I disliked the writing, especially...Is it really necessary to compare someone's necktie to a samosa just because it is a book about India? The book could have been trimmed by at least 200 pages. The story would probably make a passable screenplay.Also look at R.K. Narayan's novel, The Guide, which puts Mistry and those like him, to shame."
1,Long boring soap opera.,"For people who buy their books by the pound. After 140 pages, I found no wit or wisdom at all. Reviews about it being like Tolstoy, Dickens, or 19th century novels must be just talking about its length.I will be more careful about my next from Oprah's Picks."
5,Great,Book came in perfect condition in really quick time. Its a beautiful written book so far. I am really enjoying it.
5,A Fine Balance,"Can't put it down, stays with you years after you've finished...this is my second time buying it!"
1,Unrelenting Horror,This is a wonderfully written book. I have learnt so much about India from it but have overwhelmed with the unrelenting horror of the lives of the main characters. The skill of the author is a double edged sword - creating an incredibly well written book - that traumatises. Read this only if you have roboust emotional and mental heatlh. I
1,A Fine Balance,"What a depressing book. It may have been well written, but I sure don't want to visit India after reading it. Ugh."
2,Ouch.,"Yes, yes, it is brilliantly witten but the outcomes of the characters absolutely destroyed me. Not a happy ending to speak of...And you become so immersed in the characters. You care so deeply about what happens to them that when their lives come to a conclusion, it feels as though you are suffering as they suffer. And that's just not fair. It's too brutal, devoid of hope, leaves you in utter despair. I sponsor 4 children through World Vision India and this book made me want to fly there immediately and retrieve them all, families included. The horrible thing is, this book is the truth about India. It's what the people have been and are dealing with, trying to live through, it's all true.So if this book makes you want to do something, then by all means do it. Even if that means supporting one child through World Vision India. This book served as a further call to action as no human being should ever be faced with such destruction and indignation. Bless all sentient beings."
5,my fave book ever,This is just the most wonderful book ever written. Self-enhancement: I am among the many that read it before Ope.
2,Disappointing characters,"I don't like it when books rely on anthropological details to provide interest -- just the different customs of a place (India) and the constraints placed on characters' lives is not enough to make a book interesting, imo. I need to really see inside the characters and see how their lives and growth are informed and constrained by what their situations provide and do not provide, and I didn't feel this here. These characters were not much better than types to me, the penny-pinching small business owner, e.g."
4,"Well written, and hard hitting","This book is wonderfully written, with rich characters that come to life. However, it is so depressing that it made me want to kill myself. I highly recommend it if you're not a big fan of hopefulness."
5,What a great read...,I have recommended this to friends and all have raved. This is a wonderfully entertaining and well written book. I will never forget the characters. Mistry has written a masterpiece.
5,A Literary Delight,"I read this book because it was on Oprah's Book Club list and I'm glad I did. It may seem a bit overwhelming or slow paced at first, but the characters grew on me. And the setting is so vividly detailed that I just could not put it down. The many layers of this book reveal an intricate story of the past, that made me feel I had gone back in time.Lovely read."
5,My favorite book,"This is truly my favorite book of all time. It did what i believe good books have to do: it made me care, both about the people and the subject matter. When I put it down to do something else I felt a sense of urgency to get back to see what my friends, the characters, were doing while I was away. Although incredibly tragic things happen throughout the book, that isn't the feeling I was left with. It's much more about the amazing intersection of people's lives, and the incredible strength and resilience of the human spirit. It's a long book and yet I still wanted more. Unfortunately I didn't have the same experience at all with Mistry's other work. Buy it and enjoy!"
5,A Fine Balance,"What a beautifully written book! A culture so backwards with a government so very corrupt, yet still human. It teaches you about a different culture and tells you their thoughts, tribulations and joys. I absolutely loved it. To learn how these fellow humans existed and depended upon one another is so very inspirational. It will really make you appreciate your life and the gifts that have been given to you.AMAZING!!!!"
5,Life-changing book,"A friend of mine that I deeply respect who reads a book or two a week showed me this book and simply said, ""This book changed my life."" Whoa, I thought, this is worth reading.I was nearly halfway through before I started to like the book. Then I fell in love, with the characters, I fell hard and was reeling the rest of the book.One of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in life was reading this book."
3,As if life wasn't depressing enough...,"A writer has to go out and feed us more despair. I loved the words, the language, the way the story flowed and drew me in. But to travel through life with such arresting, idiosyncratic yet endearing characters, and then to find nothing redeeming at the end of it the journey is way to dark and heavy for me.If the writer was trying to convey the sometimes, futility of life and how men sometimes create their own undoing, he was VERY successful.Read it for the literary pleasure."
4,"Sad, sad, sad","I finished this book a month ago and still find myself thinking about the characters almost daily. The ending was not what I expected, but nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
2,"Well Written, Terribly Depressing","Although the book is well written, and the story compels one to keep turning pages, the author's extremely pessimistic view of reality left me positively blue. All the characters meet horrible fates. A little dramatic relief, a little humor, some lighter moments, would have made this book easier to digest."
2,good read but depressing,"It is certainly a good read. At the same time, it stereotypes the squalor and poverty of India.Although technically well written, I will never read it again. Nothing good can ever happen to the characters. When you think the worst is over, the author throws another gaunlet and makes their fate even worse.Overall, a depressing read."
2,unrelenting misery ruins an otherwise good book,"well written, some memorable characters and narrative but he loses 2 or 3 stars but laying on the misery so thick at the end. Lost a lot of credibility in my eyes as I felt i was being pounded into submission and my emotions were being manipulated into a dark, nihilistic vision of despair. Way over the top and almost completely ruined itI dont mind sad, I dont mind despair, and happy endings are not necessary, but real life is rarely so unrelentingly sad as this.A pity because when it was good it was very good....."
2,Murphy's Law,"This book is the epitome of Murphy's Law- what can go wrong, will go wrong. It is so needlessly depressing. I am not one to only read books that are filled with sunshine and rainbows, but like many other reviewers have said, the problems faced by the characters in this book are SO numerous that as I read it, I became jaded. This book exhausted and numbed me and towards the end, the misfortunes of the characters had no affect on me.I do feel like the author stereotyped India and Indian citizens to some degree. I feel like non Indians or non South Asians who read this book will walk away with an image of India that is not particularly accurate.While his writing style is quite good, it gets a bit claustrophobic. Overall, the depression just makes it unbelievable. I did not enjoy this book at all."
5,Wonderfully Written Novel,Rohinton Mistry has written with great eloquence. This book is highly recommended and is throughly enjoyable till the end.
4,"Hopeless, Depressing","I learned about the misery and injustice of being poor, or even middle class, in India during ""the Emergency"". There was nothing objectionable but nothing brilliant about the writing itself. I don't mind books that depict the grimness of life, but I prefer books that temper it with at least a little hope (see The Road by Cormac McCarthy). Maybe I want a little less realism."
3,Be prepared for depression.,Very easy to read but a very depressing story. Not a stuggle to success story.
5,Haunting-- this one will stick with you,"This is a beautiful, magical, haunting book. It's not an easy read, so be prepared to spend time with it. Mistry's descriptions, plot, and characters are deep and complex. It's worth every minute, though- by the time you're finished you'll have learned quite a bit about Indian culture and yourself, too."
5,Fantastic Read,"This book captivates you and makes you feel for the characters. By the middle of it you can't help but say, ""Damn, can't these guys catch a break??"" Either way - good book. I've read a lot of reviews on here saying that it's depressing, but I didn't get depressed at all. In fact, it made me appreciate my life as I live it today. Frustrating that other reviewers say the book isn't good because it thoroughly expresses hard times...so what? It's not for the faint of heart so if you're an animal rights activist, human rights activist, or any other kind of activist - don't read this book. It's meant to entertain, and a book doesn't have to be all gummy bears and daisies for it to be an entertaining and good read. If you like Shantaram, you'll like this as well."
5,A fine balance,Sensitive rendering of subjects we would rather not confront - these characters will live on in your consciousness long after the last page is turned
4,An epic story,"The first word that comes to mind in describing this novel is ""epic"". It certainly spans a lot of time, a lot of lives, and a lot of stories. And it does so very well. Set in India through the middle half of the 20th century, it describes an environment of corruption, poverty, and fatalism that was enlightening. The characters in this novel, for the most part, are resigned to their course in life and are passive in terms of affecting change. The novel aims for sweeping grandeur, and achieves it. This are wrapped up a little too tidily in the end, but this is definitely a worthy read."
5,If you only read one book this year...,"What can I add to the above reviews...? It's 4am and I just finished reading this book. I'm done laughing, pondering and crying for a while, but this book will remain indelibly marked on my view of the world I live in. Mistry must be commended on this magnificent work that has leapt near the top of my favorite book list in my humble abode (which is rapidly growing to resemble a library rather than a home).This is truly a classic work."
3,Tragic,This book was great! Don't hold your breath for the happily ever after. The author follows life not what will sell best.
2,Long-winded and unconvincing,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Mistry's book of short stories, I was expecting a similar treat when I bought this book. Mistry should stick to stories about Parsi communities in Bombay--there he is most convincing, irrepresible, humane and enjoyable. The portraits of the 2 tailors challenge credulity, as does the plot structure; the ""lower castes"" are basic stereotypes. Since the novel takes about 150 pages (Section XIII) to wind down without any major revelations or denouements, it becomes an anti-climactic tedium."
1,A disappointment,"Just finished reading this book; while well-written, it has only made me hate the entire country of India and humanity in general. The theme of the book is that ""everything ends badly"" and this book was no exception."
3,I'd rather read a novel than a polemic.,"I must give this book credit for being well written, having interesting characters, and certainly plenty of plot twists. That said I felt that the details spent too much time trying to prove a point, to show us all just how bad it was, and how ... the Indian government could be. Maybe letting the characters lives speak for themselves without throwing in so much political agenda would have worked just as well and made me feel more invested in the characters. I'd rather read a novel than a polemic, so this depressingly accurate book is staying on the shelf for me."
5,A mind-expanding read,This book was so enthralling I could not bear to put it down. The characters were so engaging that one's empathy was extracted and squeezed out most deservedly. I have always been attracted to the idea of visiting such a colourful and diverse country as India but never really considered the poverty and struggle to maintain dignity against the odds that these characters had in this novel.Totally compelling.
4,A Fine Balance,"Coming from India with a family who have gone through similar hardships, Mistry's story is neither unfamiliar nor exaggerated. The fortitude of the characters, their hope and despair is common in third world countries where corruption is rampant and poverty is prevalent. Mistry's story is effortlessly emotive and brings the reader closer to real people by sketching true-to-life characters, true-to-life drama against a true-to-life backdrop."
4,Depressing,"It took almost three months to finish this book. Not that it was boring, it was just quite draining psychologically. The book is very engrossing and writing is compact. There are so many misfortune happen to all the characters in this book that I felt I was living through those misery with them. I found myself keep hoping something good to happen to them but it never does. I could barely go through few pages a day. When I finally finished it, I could not fall a sleep for awhile. How could anyone's life so full of misery and misfortune??!! But I recommend this book to anyone. It again amazes me that one's writing can have such a impact on readers."
4,a journey....,"This book was completely different to anything I have read. Beautifully written, it flowed from start to end. The simple but complex characters, the sadness and despair that they bravely endure, their continual battles, their exceptance of circumstance beyond their control and their continued hope that all will be ok, is a reality check for all of us. Definitely recommend this journey."
5,Loved this book,"I enjoy reading fiction that takes me deeply into cultures I'm unfamiliar with. A Fine Balance is such a book and more. The characters are knowable and lovable. He seems to find redeeming qualities in most of them. Minstry's prose is poetic and thought provoking. Myself, a proponent of social justice, I have much to learn about poverty and inequality. This book extended my education of them in deeply moving ways. I couldn't put it down and then took days to finish the last 100 pages because I didn't want it to end. An unforgettable book."
4,"I never thought I'd enjoy an ""Oprah' Book Club"" selection","One of the most heart-wrenching books ever written. In addition, it offers tremendous insight into the lives of street level Indians and their struggles in a system where human life and the dignity of an individual person is absent (informed by a ""so what, reincarnation will take care of it or punish it"" attitude).This is a necessary work for Americans to read to understand India beyond the frenetic joyousness of Bollywood or the class-struggle induced by outsourced jobs and white-collar underbidding. The characters and political setting give voice to the unique challenges of the world's most populous democracy and those ssocial mores and taboos that arrest her progress and damn her citizens to inescapably unhappy lives. Sad and profound and hopeless, this is India's Le Pere Goriot."
3,Depressed and miserable!,"The story really touched my heart and soul. Very beautifully written, but depressing ! Seems the misery never ends. Life so unfair to everyone, to each character in this book.If you like to know more about Indian culture and their struggle in human life system, you might like this book like I do. Just be prepared to get depressed after reading this !"
4,Reality Bites,"As an Indian ex-pat, I felt this book captured the essence of life in big-city India. I was amazed at how the political landscape dominated the lives of the poor and unfortunate jophadpatti-dwellers and the lower income people trying to survive in the big city.While it wasn't the most uplifting book to read, I felt it was incredibly well written and gave the reader a true glimpse into rural life as well as city life for the untouchable caste and lower income classes in 70's India. Anyone looking to get a feel-good bhel-puri story is sure to be disappointed, because this is about reality.The central characters were truly gripping, and the reader finds themselves caring about each of them immediately. There is so much to tell about each of their lives, so that one gets the full appreciation of who they are and their current situation. The author does not disappoint.I would easily rank this in my top 3 favorite Indian novels."
5,A fabulous read.,"I loved this book. It is, no doubt, one of the best I have read in the past two years. Even though much of the book is just heartbreakingly sad, it is written so incredibly well that I couldn't wait to read it again each time I put it down. You will feel as if you have met 4 new real people who have very tragic lives. There are a few times when Mistry hits you over the head with something symbolic so that you simply can't miss his message. It's not a very subtle book. Nonetheless, it is a fabulous read and a superb lesson on the terrible governmental abuses that occurred during the ""reign"" of Indira Ghandi. The book helps you appreciate that things have always been rough in India for lots of different types of people but that I. Ghandi's ""Emergency"" made things horrible for, it seems, millions of people."
2,Where is the balance?,"I was throughly disappointed with this book and found that half through it the author abandoned the fundamental concept he himself introduced - the fine balance between hope and despair. Towards the end, the narration slips into the darkness, tragedy and ugliness of such concentration, that the brain refuses to accept it as realistically possible."
5,Exhilarating!!!!!!,"It's been almost 2 months since i read this book, but when i came across this chance to post a review, i couldn't hold back. No other book left me as breathless with grief and bliss as this book did. I only wish i could thank Mr. Mistry in person for this exquisite gift he has bestowed on us."
4,Distant but enjoyable prose...,Distant but enjoyable prose combined with a subtle and fascinating discourse on India; fly-on-the-wall cultural insight that riveted me...
5,Read and be prepared for a long lasting presonal effect,"Our human condition, our personal story, politics of our time, woven into a rich tapestry. After you read Rohington's tapestry be prepared for a 'mental' time out after the experience. Rarely has someone's writing caused such a deep reflective state upon finishing the last page."
3,WHERE'S THE SWORD?,"Shame on movie distributors that put your action hero on the front and misrepresent the movie! Gary Daniels never even touches a sword in this one! Shame, shame!Aside from that, here's some thoughts about BLACK FRIDAY:*Director Darren Doane has a nifty camera eye, with his use of pastel abstract colors and some unusual filming of the film's two long fight scenes.*Why does Dean Campbell give up his family to help out in this caper?*Gary Daniels has a commanding stage presence, able to blend his fierce martial arts persona and that of your average Joe. He is to be commended for trying to be an ""actor"" instead of a ""martial arts"" star, but he should remember---he is still a martial arts star and he should put a little more action in his movies. The long fifteen minute sequence between him and his friend, Matt, is filmed at such a strange angle it diminishes the performances.*This is not a great movie, but enjoyable in a cinematic way."
2,For true Hawkwind fans only...,"This album has some of Hawkwind's worst moments, most notably when Dave Brock tries to sing ""Spirit of the Age"". That song should have been permanently retired when Robert Calvert left the band. Brock's attempt at it is stunningly bad. Silver Machine is too short to be enjoyable, and Brainstorm is extremely mediocre. There are good versions of ""Shot Down In The Night"" and ""Levitation"", but there are two or three better versions of those songs available elsewhere. That leaves us with only one real reason to buy the album: Tim Blake's keyboard/synth instrumental ""Lighthouse"", but do you really want to buy a whole CD for one instrumental? Only buy this album if you are a completist Hawkwind collector."
5,Peg Hooks purchased individually,"Thankful for sellers out there who will let you buy individually what you need like an old fashioned hardware store. We have all 4 big superhardware stores in our area and they all sell pgkd deals on these peg hooks, none of which serve our needs. I plugged them into amazon and here is exactly what we need from this seller. We choose the length and style and quantity to our specifications. I chose these as they do not have ball on end, which makes utensils easy to slide on and off. The 1/8"" accomodates most utenils and measuring cups with the small holes they have. Did I mention inexpensive as well? The shipping is kept at a low level as well. Awesome deal, we will be back for more. My mother loves to cook,bake and decorate, so she has her pegboard up and hangs all her utensils up for easy grab, no sifting through drawers trying to find, when shes got something cooked up right then."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these a while ago so this may not reflect what the vendor is currently shipping. The hooks I got were crooked and of smaller diameter steel rod than the others in my shop. And they don't have rubber tips, which would have been nice. I guess I cheaped out too much and got what I paid for. I would not do this again; a decision made worse considering shipping costs. Buy cheap, and lament. Buy quality and don't look back."
5,sham's best,"save the last 4 tracks, this cd is awesome. the first 11 are their most oi!/street punk sounding that are on here. the rest are great as well, but have more of a straight rock and somewhat pop feel, yet still retain their punk sound and attitude. i'm glad that left the horrible garbage off the 'volunteer' album on here...it's even worse than the last 4 songs which are disposable enough for my tastes."
1,An insult to intelligence and common sense,"All stories have the same old rhetoric about how one person experienced something alone. The old adage, ""if you look for a boogeyman in the closet long enough, you will eventually see one"" is ever present.Do not loose IQ points or brain cells in this FICTION!"
1,Way to fantastical!,"I bought the book due to the reviews, even though I have seen this couple on tv and wondered about them. I found this book way too fantastical. Some of the stories were waaaay out there! I don't even think they investigated any of the cases. Not all of the stories dealt with ghost, some banshees,demons. Also very short book. I wondered if they just wrote down passed down stories."
2,Don't come looking for much here,"This book is about 4 years too late. Nothing revoluntionary here. Same ""my work, my way"" and ""Free Agent Nation"" stuff we've been hearing for years now.Do yourself a favor, if you have to read it, get it at the library. It'll take you a couple of hours to read and save you a few bucks."
1,"If this is Pike, it is not at his best","Freemasons wanting to perform a degree using this book will be bitterly disapointed. Something makes me doubt that this is authentic Albert Pike. So much text is amputated - the reader will end by not having much knowledge of the Scottish Rite blue degrees.Half of the book consists of unrelated graphics, poorely reproduced, and of an abusively overused stock."
3,OK With Some Shortcomings,"I purchased one of these but could not use it. Unlike the Palm cradle, this unit does not work with Treo 680s. I guess that's why the Palm is more expensive.I gave it to a co-worker who has a Treo 700P. She reports that it works fine with that phone. The synch button on the cradle seems to operate reliably, unlike some other cradles. The LED is on whenever the unit is plugged in, but does not indicate the charge status of the battery - one must rely upon the Treo indicator for that.So...recommended with reservations if you have one of the listed phones or a 700P. Don't even think about it if you have a Treo 680 or 750/755."
2,"Ridiculous ""Censored"" version of the movie.... AGAIN!","DONT BUY IT! I really wish someday Mexican film distributors would stop releasing censored versions of their films but sadly, I don't think they know any better. This is a SEX COMEDY yet most the good parts (if you will) are removed by censors, yet again. Why do people destroy their own films on DVD when the entire point of the format is to do the opposite!? I will never understand how this happens so often with Mexican DVDs. Don't buy this if you want to see it the way it supposed to be seen.. rent the VHS instead."
2,Not very funny and a bit boring.,"The topic of the movie is mainly the sexual organ of this guy being replace for a Bionic one, but he still can't get aroused,.the idea was not that bad, but the editing takes away most of the best and real erotic parts,.Andres Garcia looks good, too bad he made this real bad movie,.the sound is also bad."
4,IT IS A VERRY DEEP INTERPRETATION OF FEELINGS,"IT IS A NICE CD TO KEEP IF YOU ENJOY TRADITIONAL MEXICAN MUSIC, ESPECIALLY ROMANTIC"
3,Could Be Better,Out the albums that I've from Tony Vega(from Aparentemente through Despues De Todo only) this one is at the bottom of his favorites. It has some good songs but I always have to skip tracks 4 and 8; very weak.
4,Hope Diamond - best in Detroit!,"I live in the Metro Detroit area, and I discovered Hope Diamond by accident. I bought their CD to be nice, and was completely blown away. The other bands in this area seem so amateurish compared to Hope Diamond, and the CD proves it. These songs are so different than the stuff you keep hearing from indie bands.They have different singers for each song, so you never get bored. Like ""Only time will tell"" (my favorite) or ""I am My gun"" (it ROCKS) they are always doing something different.If you really want something different BUY THIS CD! You'll be amazed, I promise."
1,Better off with tape,"Great idea but in practice this camera doesn't live up to expectations. The DVA-RAM re-recordable media is fairly esoteric, expensive and not compatible with most DVD readers. The other recoding media; DVD-R, has a hitch - after you record your 30 minutes of video, the disc needs to be ""finalized"" before it can be replayed in a DVD player. This takes at least 7minutes. You can't use the camera during this time and it must be plugged into its AC adapter. If ""finalization"" fails, you've lost all of your video on that DVD and it can't be recovered. Just happened to me so I thought I'd share the experience with others. At present, miniDV tape seems like a safer and more reliable option. This particular camera would only be useful to people who already own a device that can read 8cm DVD-RAM discs and copy them to other media."
1,Unable to intergrate with Vista (NEW PC),"The camera functioned well, but is in no way compatiable with Vista or and newer systems. Drivers are not available, so thusly this camera is an peice of junk. Would never recommend it or Panasonic to any one."
1,Lost memories and no help from Panasonic,"I have had this camera for about two years. I have gone through about 20 CDs and today the second one errored out and lost the data. No more video of my son's birthday. Just like that. The discs are working fine and then they come up with an error and that's it. Throw away your disc and your memories. I have used two kinds of media and both have had the same problem. Go to Panasonic's support web and site and there is NOTHING. Their FAQ on camcorders is a short marketing piece, so you're basically on your own. There must be a thousand better products than this one. Don't buy it unless you don't mind losing your video."
2,Average camera in its day but now obsolete,"The VDR-M50 was an average camera around 2005, but is now obsolete. If you are buying this second hand then be warned that Panasonic supply no drivers or tools for Vista, so you need third party tools such as Roxio Creator to extract your movies from the DVD-RAM disks - probably not worth the trouble. Picture quality is just OK even on the highest quality setting. The VDR-M50 has some nice features including in-camera editing facilities but these are not enough to redeem it."
2,Shane is interesting as always...writing is horrible,"This book was a major disappointment for me, I write annoyingly. It seems the ""author"" had a deadline to meet and threw this trash together at the last minute, I write this time frustratingly. If you like reading an adverb at the end of every sentence this is the book for you. The author has an amazing subject to work with here and chooses to simply mail it in. I can't believe the publisher let her get away with this. If I ever meet this author I will ask for my money back quickly. I teach third grade and most of my students write better than this garbage. I wish I never bought it, I end this review disappointedly."
1,Self involved tripe,"I was so looking forward to reading this, however Victoria Mary Clarke (hereafter VMC) chose this to be her sounding board on her self importance. Practically every chapter had some form of self praise ""Victoria nodded attractively"" ""Victoria shook a prada cladded foot"" ""Victoria nibbled a digestive biscuit attractively"" (not word for word quotes)What should have been a riot of a read was sullied by an amateur shot of VMC trying to grab the limelightTerrible"
4,MacGowan and His Girl with Green Eyes,"A Drink with Shane MacGowan is a great read not only for fans and those curious about the break up of the Pogues but those who enjoy a bit of craic or great storytelling. One gets a peek inside a very unique and brilliant mind and also gains knowledge of interesting bits of Irish and punk era history. The somewhat maligned question and answer format is, in fact, an engaging way to shed light on the relationship between MacGowan and his closest companion. While leading to a greater understanding of the man himself, it acquaints the reader with Clarke, an interesting character in her own right. An established writer, she peppers the banter with lighthearted sarcasm, humorously toying with writing styles much in the way of Joyce (another first year English lit. groupie!)All in all it is a great book with a pint in a quiet corner of your favorite pub but works as well with tea and flannel pajamas - highly recommended!"
4,Rock and Roll Paddy,"""A drink with Shane MacGowan"" is a series of recorded interviews with Shane by longtime girlfriend Victoria Clarke. It is an interesting approach and Victoria gets Shane to open up in ways the media, of course, would be unable to. The beginning of the London punk scene, family, drugs/drink, racism, religion, authors, the end of the Pogues and his life's philosophy are just a few of the many topics covered by Shane and Victoria. Also included are some handwritten songs and drawings which were a cool touch and greatly contribute to the book. The only downside to this book was Victoria's overdone, heavy handed (and self complimentary) chapter introductions. But these will be easily forgiven, for this is a fascinating conversation with an amazing songwriter. Definitely recommended for any music, Pogues/Popes or punk fans."
2,Check please!,"Let me first say I love Shane MacGowan, but after this book apparently one drink would be plenty. Written in a very odd style, including the anoying snipets of Shane's partner Victoria who does everthing in such a way that ends in an adverb. I understand the ability to actually try to ""interview"" Shane MacGowan must have been tough, even though she lived with him. It's a swirling stream of drunken conscienceness that at times made me feel like I was losing my own brain cells. It's a look into the mind of a lyrical genious that maybe I for one was not genious enough to understand.I love The Pogues, The Popes and Shane MacGowan but I can't in good conscience recommend this book to anyone."
3,Kinda interesting,"I love all things pogues/Shane, but this was rather dull. i would recommend it if i could get it at the library."
4,"a rockin', boppin' lunatic","i read this one in one sitting, such is my keeness for the subject of ""A Drink With Shane MacGowan"", most appropriately titled since, impressionistically, i felt as though i might have been seated in a snug of some smokey pub listening to Clarke and MacGowan discuss,(and in some cases argue about) what must have been heady, intoxicating times. while i can't reccomend ""A Drink..."" to intolerants, begrudgers or teetotalers, people who have a general interest in punk or a more specific interest in the Pogues and Shaney Mac himself, will find this great crack."
1,Be Aware-This Is A Compilation/Pre-View CD!,"I bought this CD thinking that this was Clint Black's self-titled album. There were no track listings. But got the CD only to find out there are only 8 songs and they are all from his ""Killin' Time"" and ""Put Yourself In My Shoes"" albums. It's a ""Sound Value"" value CD (1993).""Killin' Time""A Better ManWinding DownLive And LearnYou've Gonna Leave Me Again""Put Yourself In My Shoes""The Gulf Of MexicoMuddy WaterThe Old ManThis Nightlife"
5,Real eye opener,"Whether you are a recovering alcoholic or an adult child of an alcoholic, this book will open your eyes to the devastation of alcohol abuse. Very helpful workbook format that is ideal for discussion groups. Easy to follow...easy to read...easy to understand. I highly recommend it!"
1,"""Repeat"" is not Realistic","This is a work book designed to help ACOAs break free of the constraints of their upbringing. I am an ACOA and, like you reading my review, wanted to believe that re-training my thinking and outlook through these text book exercises would improve my life. I am sorry to say that is NOT realistic. The book is juvenile and tiresome with it's page after page of lists of feelings and events. Also, it is nothing more than her earlier book ""It will never happen to me"" with these exercises punctuating each paradigm. My best recommendation would be to purchase her original book and save your time, hope and money by passing over the temptation to commit to Repeat after Me work book. The original book is quite insightful and thought provoking on it's own. Good luck."
1,Stay away from this book.,"This book contains exercises designed to help the reader get in touch with his emotions concerning childhood abuse. The assumption is that emotional problems are a matter of repressed emotion and that they are relieved once those emotions are brought to the light of consciousness and felt. In diligently going through these exercises about 16 years ago, my emotions became much worse. I began to have panic attacks which lasted for months. Eventually, they slowly went away. Okay then, how did I benefit from this book? Answer: I didn't. It simply made me suffer even more, while the author rakes in money and esteem through a hoax. For the sake of your own emotional integrity and well being, stay away from this book."
1,What's the point of rap anyway?,I'd rather be listening to the sound of the jet engines of a Russian-made airliner
1,I loath the movie and I loath the song.,"Who's idea was it to allow this guy to act? My God, he can't sing or write. This song is soooooooooooooooooo trite. Sounds like every other Rap song minus vulgarity."
5,Awesome new song!,"This cd really fits his style. It's a great song to dance to. The lyrics are great! I can't wait to see the movie! It's groovy, baby!"
2,sorry i bought this one,sounds better as snips on the TV commercial for the movie rather than as a 5 minute record
3,"Good song, but Sisqo is SO ANNOYING!","It's got good lyrics and a great beat...but Sisqo of Dru Hill is very, very annoying! If I ever have to listen to ""We goin' straight to the Wild Wild West"" again, my head is going to explode of a migrane headache (this song is most equivalent to a migraine headache). Still a good memorable song."
5,The Best Single Ever!,"This is absolutely great number. I'm looking for the songtekst. Wiggy Wha Wha West Jim West Desperado rough rider, no ya don't want nada, notha this Six gunnin this,brother runnin this Buffalo soldier ....."
4,Cool + Cool,It is an awesome song! If you are a Will Smith fan get into The Wild Wild West! This song is cool because every time you listen to it you do The Wild Wild West.
3,Good but not good enough to be number one!,"The song definitely isn`t Will`s best song, to be honest I can`t really tell the difference between his songs unless they have a label on! Men In Black was definitely my favourite song. Wild Wild West is totally too long for my pleasure, the lines are just repeated over and over. I think it is just another song to sing in the shower!"
5,This Single Rules! =),"Will Smith is a GREAT and AWESOME artist, he is so funny and a great actor, and I love Him! His music is amazing, and it really shows how much he cares about music. His new Song WILD WILD WEST, is GREAT it tells a story, has a great beat. If you like funky music, this is the song for you! TiNa!!"
5,WILL SMITH AND THE WILD WILD WEST ROCK!,"The Wild Wild West was the best movie I have ever seen! Will Smith rocks, and I love Salma Hayak! His song rocks as much as the movie! You have to buy the CD!"
1,I wish this vacant Hip-Hop subculture would just die.,"It's pretty obvious that Smith can't act or write a clever, invigorating song. I wish he'd just die."
4,Good Read,The opening chapter got me hooked. I read it straight through. I understand that this is GN Henson's first published novel. I bet that people will demand a second one once they have read An Ill Wind.If you like a good story that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last chapter then this is a must buy.
2,too little words collection.,"the cover is very deceving.you dont know how manys words it has,i thought it will have more words collection then pocket dictionary,i was wrong.it is very thin lean dictionary,with very very few words.it does not solve the purpose as a resource.i called the company to return it,but the shipping and handeling was non refundable,and sending it back would have cost more money,so it was not worth the effort.the cover dont tell you and the publisher dont mention it either how many words are there in this dictionary.waste of money for serious use."
2,Not nearly as good as the Lindsay Chamberlain books,"I had waited eagerly for Ms. Connor's newest offering, but I am sorry to say that I disagree with previous reviewers. I found this book to be a disappointment. The writing just isn't as good as in her earlier books. The things that happen are too unbelievable, even for a murder mystery, and the characterizations are contradictory. I won't give anything away, but some of the main character's actions make one wonder whether she is really as smart as her forensic background and position indicate. There are several side stories going on, each of which is more boring than the last except for the titillation of possible violence. The story doesn't seem worth the 383 pages it takes to tell it. Better luck next time!"
2,One plot to many ??,"I was a litte disappointed. This book feels as if she wrote it in a hurry and some of the plots are just unbelievable. The heroine, Dr. Diane Fallon, gets beat up two times in this novel and yet she still insists of ""i'm going to be fine, just need a full nights sleep alone in my apartment"". Is she Indiana Jones or what ?? Also, I could never get into the characters, they were just not outlined enough. That's what I like about Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reich, their heroines are human and clearly outlined with emotions you can almost feel."
5,ONE GRAVE TOO MANY,This book was exciting and I enjoyed the forensic explanations. I hated to stop reading! I am looking forward to the next book.
3,New author to me,"I am sorry - I have not been able to read this novel yet, as my Kindle has lines across the screen and also is not responding to being switched off. I am hoping it can be repaired.Hazel MacDonald"
2,Pedantic,"(spoiler alert) I found the writing in this book to be stilted. The conversations were robotic, and the plot was boring. The whole point of the forensic work performed was to solve the case of a victim whose story takes up about 1/10 of the overall plot. The rest of the mysteries are solved by one of Fallon's employees stumbling upon some important information. That's it. The 'subplot' is really the main plot, and I'll tell you, it's a snoozer."
3,A Must Have For Non-Mainstream Fans Of Early 90s R&B,"Jerry Lattisaw, DeVaughn Howard, Eric Sanders, Damon Dunnock, and Tony Dumas formed an R&B vocal quintet in Washington, D.C. in 1993, releasing their self-titled debut the same year on RCA records. ""Wantu Back,"" was the lead single (released Jun 28, 1993) peaking at no. 45 on the R&B singles and tracks chart; this shouldn't destroy the singles credibility. Me-2-U falls into a congested genre in the early '90s; Hip-Hop, Dance-Pop, Urban, Club/Dance, New Jack Swing, like most groups of that era (Real Seduction, II D Extreme, Main Attraction, and The Voices), Me-2-U struggled to find mainstream audience, but their New Jack, street look kept them around long enough for two follow-up singles; ""All Night,"" and ""Raindrops."""
3,Decent Cd with some Flaws,"this is a really good cd with very well sang songs, only thing that made me angry was the song called HO was edited with lots of bleeps same with last 4 songs.....there was enough profanity to make the whole cd explicid content. i hate edited music! and that just ruined it for me near the end."
3,sophomore slump.,"amanda perez is an immensely talented songwriter and musician. that's why i was a little disappointed to find that _i pray_ is little more than a rehashing of _angel_. the lead single, ""i pray"", bears more than a passing resemblance to ""angel"" which, inexplicably, makes its second encore appearance on this album--it appared first on the original release of her debut album, and, again, on the re-edited virgin release--leaving one to wonder if ""angel"" will appear on every album perez produces. having said all of this, perez' work is still a breath of fresh air, when compared to what's currently on the market. the world needs more latino/a hip-hop artists and her work is infused with an old-skool flavor that calls to mind artists like brenda & the tabulations and brenda holloway."
2,Good single......bad album,"I bought this album because of the songs ""Angel"" & ""I Pray"". I also bought it because I do like Amanda's voice. But the album as a whole is a dissappointment!!!All of the songs sound the same, except the last couple tracks. The problem is you don't ever get to them cause you fall asleep within the first few songs.I do believe that Amanda has talent....but the songs on this album covered it up!!!"
4,BEAUTIFUL!,"Amanda Perez is truly a musical genius. She not only sings, raps, and plays piano; But she also produces, writes, and arranges her songs. She's a unique talent on a level all her own. This album proves it. I hope she has many more years and albums in her because she truly sets an example for female artists. ""I Pray"" is definitely an album you DON'T wanna sleep on!!!"
1,"Um, where's the talent?","I am totally horrified that this is in the mainstream music scene. Sure, there are plenty of pop stars with minimal talent, but she tries to sound like she has talent with her attempted runs but really it just makes me cringe. There is nothing unique and exciting about her voice, it sounds like she's trying to imitate the popular sound today and she's not even close..pitch is off, tone is boring, songs are a drag. As a fan of comtemporary R&B and some pop, this is exactly what is wrong with the music industry, artists making money that have no talent and nothing new to offer. Sorry Amamda, I know you did your best but I don't think it's any where near good enough to compare with your competition."
1,Poor quality fell apart in a few months,"I would not purchase this product ever again. I had a older USA made saddleman seat cover that I was replacing in a 1970 Chev PU. The old one held up for several years. The new one which is now made in China is a P.O.S! Just another example of why some american companys should have kept their business here in the good ol' USA. I would have gladly paid more to get a exact USA made replacement, So now here I am currently looking for a different product altogether."
3,pricey,"while the overall product line is quite good, this book of digital paper is priced quite high. the a5 size which fit 5.5 x 8.5 diaries/notebooks is a better buy. if you need a notebook of non-removable 8.5 x 11 pages, it's for you."
3,Nice but overpriced,"Considering how few pages there are in this notebook it is prohibitive in cost. The vendor should offer packs of three and discount them.Stick with the spiral binders, or revert to pen and ink and a scanner."
5,Wonderfully Christ-centered emphasis!,"Henry Morris does an excellent job of showing that the account of Jonah is not only true (actually happened), but that Jonah is a striking type of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is front and center in the story of Jonah! It is not simply a fish tale! What a wonderful book that shows God's mercy towards man!"
1,A Bible scholar Morris ain't. . .,"Henry Morris has made a career of promoting hyper-literal (read, his own) interpretations of Scripture, especially as it involves the so-called ""Creation Science"" debate.Now he turns to Jonah. Morris is so convinced of the literal accuracy of the Jonah account, that he fails to see the forest for the trees.The POINT of the Jonah account has little to do with what species of fish might be able to swallow a man whole and alive and a GREAT DEAL to do with the love of God for mankind, and the desire of God to see the repentance of the wicked. Morris could have read the last verse of Jonah 4 and not bothered with writing the book in the first place!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"This book is incredible. Beyond incredible, it is PHENOMENAL. I have never felt so fufilled by a piece of literature. It exceeded any expectation I could have ever had for any book. Choosing not to purchase this would be the stupidest decision a person could make.Every person I know has read this book. If you do not own a copy for yourself, you'll be out of the loop in any truly intellectual social situation."
5,AMAZING,"This book is the finest, most enthralling piece of literature ever written in the English language...it is truly inspirational."
1,Sheets recieved with tears and rips in them,"Dont buy, save your money. Opened up the box, put on my bed and noticed 2 tears in the fitted sheet. Unbelievable, waste of time and waste of money."
4,Slick,"Silky, of course, if a bit on the fragile side. Yet to submit it to a careful cold-water washing. One problem is the fabric is a bit low in that quality of ""breathing,"" which means to lie in one position can leave you a tad hot. Very, very light and, I suppose, kind of sexy, if you're into that sort of thing."
4,Too dark,"These sheets looked dark gray in the bedroom lighting. Kinda depressing. I was expecting more whats in the picture, so I sent them back, unopened. I had the chamoise collection light gray silver before, but those did not last long; I just bought from Kmart a much lighter silver satin version, I will keep my fingers crossed."
3,Older was Better!,"Have bought these seat covers twice, in 1986 & 2001. The first set was really nice because it did not come with head rest section and most trucks in 1986 did not have them and they fit really well. When they wore out in 2001, we bought 2nd set (with head rest portion) and they don't fit as well and have already torn. They were also very hard to install. I hope the one I am purchasing today does not come with head rest part. Also. description did not say whether they have storage pockets; (old ones did)"
2,"In my opinion, this cd is not the jazz style that i enjoy","This is not one of Daves' better cds. It is alright, but no cigar, thank you.For this cd there were some birght spots, but not enough to really satisfy me. Dave played well on some of the songs, but then played poorly on some of the songs. There was no consistiency of a performance on this cd.Well, i'm looking forward to buying more of Daves' product in the hopes of finding that home run. I know it's there, but were is the question.I know it must be hard to please all of us selfish fans, but please try!Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
2,Streaming video has issues,"I hate not to be able to comment on the merits of the film, but as of this writing (1/19/13), once you get past the part where the name of the movie is shown (I believe the term is ""title sequence""), the audio and video on the streaming version are noticeably out of sync. I got the same result both with my Roku player and with watching the movie in my browser. I would love to be able to watch the whole movie, but I couldn't watch more than about 5-10 minutes without having to skip ahead, and I stopped less than an hour in."
2,cheap imitation,"I had owned this model already, which was well made and the base (floor version) was a deep cherry/brown wood. I used mine every night for approximately 3 years and the motor finally gave out. I ordered this to replace it. The fan looks like the same style but is completely inferior in all respects. The base seems like a painted metal/wood composite and is scratched up. I had to used pliers to bend the connecting plug as it was warped and also remove a piece from the lower end of the cord which wouldn't thread through the base. The fan itself has a couple nicks. The controls and connections are completely different from the one I own. This one is obviously a cheap imitation of the original. Very disappointed but after having to bend/reform some pieces and putting it together I felt I couldn't return it. Bummer."
5,Great Yoga Workout,This is a super program. I have been using it for the last two months and can feel a difference in my surfing performance and my overall health. I recommend it to any surfer who wants to involve yoga in their training. The benefits of the yoga in this DVD will help your overall athleticism and I would venture to guess any sport you partake in.
2,Not for a novice,"I would say that I am a novice at yoga. So, I thought for some reason that I would like this video. I mean I surfed for a while, so I can appreciate the appeal of practicing yoga near the ocean and stuff. But, the ""flow"" really moves, so if you're not already proficient at yoga, then you might get a little lost with this DVD."
3,"Good yoga, bad dog","Hi, I like Eoin's DVD just fine--it's a good length, good program, good overall instruction. Sometimes it's difficult to see the details on some postures because of the way the bodies are angled with the camera. My only complaint is that in the instructional section, where he demonstrates each posture with (I think) his wife, he touches her in ways that would be totally inappropriate in a classroom setting. I guess this physical intimacy is okay with husband and wife, but I've been in lots of classes where the teacher made hands-on corrections, (both male and female) and never seen anything this up-close and personal."
3,MGM has gone BAD!,"MGM is now releasing all their movies in widescreen ( which is good )but they are not ANIMORPHIC (Enhanched for widescreen T.V.'s.) Previous releases were animorphic so this doesn't make any sense. I can only assume there is a new guy at MGM and he is an idiot! The president is completely unaware of what's going on which makes him the same. Other recent DVD's are ""Follow That Dream"" and ""Shalako"". If this is unacceptable send MGM an email."
3,good but disturbing,this is disturbing when it talks about this guys wife getting raped then killed. but luckuly it doesn't show it.
3,"This action tale is good, but not as good as the former ""seven"" tales","This action tale of seven supremely competent fighters fighting against overwhelming odds in Mexico around 1900 is exciting at its end part, when the seven are fighting against the Mexican bandits who killed all the men in a small town, but it is not exciting throughout and fails to follow the formula established by the former films about the seven. Van Cleef plays a cynical marshal who has no problem taking advantage of people to secure his own ends. He is totally unlike the more likable Yul Brynner who played the role in the first film. Most significantly, unlike the former film, we are unable to really identify and like all of the seven, at most two or three."
4,nice Lee Van Cleef movie,good western not up to the original but good anyway. Lee Van Cleef did a nice job. he always does.
2,Il Magnifico Siete,"More of a cold spaghetti western (as they are called) than a true sequel to the American western original. Lee Van Cleef is found in other 'spaghetti westerns' like The Good the Bad and the Ugly with dubbed English translations over the Italian. This film is a lot of action with limited character development and amiable characters like Ronaldo the loner who in the original gets 'adopted' by a couple of the village boys only to die in their arms later.Good action, but personally I liked it less knowing that it was somewhat cold and not very true to the original."
3,History as written by the winners,"This is a valuable history of recent political and economic events written from the point of view that privatization is a good thing. Riders on British rail may quarrel with that, as may the folks bitten in the S&L bailout (by far the largest financial and political scandal in American history).Nevertheless, the book makes some good points. It just doesn't consider the possibility that sometime, somewhere government might do something right. One book to read to balance this is Bill McKibben's ""Hope, Human and Wild""--particularly the description of Curitiba Brasil."
4,Through Information,Very through in the information provided. Reading the book along with the documentary that is available online is also helpful.
2,Nothing new here,"The book is about the fall of socialism. However there is nothing here you won't find in numerous newspaper articles , magazine articles, media discussions. Read it if you can get it from a library, not worth spending money."
5,Excellent history book,"A rare book written from a really non ideological posture, and a true story, at least the parts about my country. Excellent relate, with a very balanced review of history, plenty of illustrative anecdotes for understand different nations and or historic moments of the world. Highly recommended for economists, politics, historians, and anybody who loves politic discussions. A must to understand our century and shape a good attitude to rethink anybody's old ideas about politics."
5,Very Good Review of 20th century political economy,"This is as painless an education on world 20th century political economy as possible. It is very interesting, providing a lot of good intellectual background to the major events and excellent descriptions of the events themselves. The book places excessive emphasis on Hayek, who was an important figure representing a strong ""pro-market"" voice in economics, but probably less important than Friedman and no more important than several others. The ""conflict"" bewteen Hayek and Keynes is somewhat overstated. However, this is an excellent book and the corresponding DVD is also very good."
4,Exciting reading,A very well written history of economic policy - or should I say philosophy - since the great depression. The one of 1929/30. It ends with the 'triumph' of neoliberalism in the early 1990s; that makes the authors look a bit out of inc after the most recent world economic crisis (2008). But understanding how we came from 1930s to 1980s is very worthwhile to understand how we came from 1980 to 2008. 1st class opportunity to learn something from history...
5,Superb and insightful...incredible breadth and scope,Yergin has done it again. He is a master of using his biting intellect to make a trenchant analysis of the most daunting and obscure--the global economy. This is probably the best non-fiction I have read in years!
2,Skip it and read The Prize,The Prize was riveting.This one is long and superficial although with some interesting ideas and chapters. The style is journalistic (always the same type of non sense anecdote to open a new chapter). There is too much raw stuff and not enough presentation of ideas. Chapter after chapter you will go from one country to the next but the sum of the parts does not add up to a very powerful demonstration.A decent book. By no means a must read.
2,Disappointing,"The book describes quite interestingly the development of what now has become the mainstream in political thinking, specially as to the background of the ""Thatcher revolution"" in the UK; the rest of the book is, however, rather thinly spread, providing a broad catalog of the changes in all regions of the world, without really providing any deep or novel insight; overall I believe the authors would have better done to focus solely on the US and the UK."
3,"This is not another ""The Prize"".","I was disappointed by this book, but then my expectations were very high after reading Yergin's earlier work on the history of the oil industry (5 stars!). Early on, the authors present us with a historical dilemna: the post World War II nations are distrustful of market economies and experiencing prosperity under centralized, planned economies. Yet market economies take over in a matter of decades. The authors use the strategy of a broad, global view to explain why and how -- with most of the emphasis on how. As a result, the reading is quite repetetive. The thesis is clear: market economies work best. There is almost no discussion on the limitations of market economies -- or of their social consequences. Worse, for those like myself with no background in economics, the implications of the emerging global free-market economy is virtually untouched. My advice... read ""The Prize""."
4,Excellent overview of how free markets came to dominate,The Commanding Heights by Yergin & Stanislaw does a great job of presenting how free markets came to dominate the post World War II world. They turn a somewhat dry subject(economics) into a fascinating tale. People rather than numbers drive this book and it makes the layman really care about economic policy. Even my high school students have enjoyed it.
5,This book shines!,"I loved this book. I read it in two days. The American Revolution made for an exciting background to the plot. Both characters are charming and likeable. So often in romance novels, one of the characters is not very nice. You love both of these people. The story moves very quickly, the plot is very exciting, and the ending is wonderful!"
5,Who Killed Christopher Robin,"Terry Rawlings, has written a great book in the 1960s i was in a Bandthat was hailed as the american stones .( The Rave Ups) and met the stonesand became, a good friend of Brians a week before he was killed hecame to RADA in London to see me act, Terry's book cuts to the pointof what happened. May Frank Thorogood BURN IN HELL"
3,Brian Jones,"It has been speculated many times over the decades that Keith Richards may have had a hand in it. Perhaps we'll never know, but it is known that Keith had some very harsh things to say about Brian, stoled his girlfriend and refused to attend Brian's funeral, deciding instead to work in the studio."
2,Too much like a conspiracy theory,"The author might be right on his findings, but it still seems hard to believe, and in memory and honor of Jones, there's something not right about this book. It's easy to convict a man who is dead, and that is what this book does."
4,The Strange Death Of An Evil Genius,"Rolling Stones biographies are plentiful, yet the release of this book in 1994 increased the speculation that Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones was murdered soon after he was dumped from the band in 1969. Padded out with early details of Brian's teenage fatherhood to three bastard offspring by separate girls, his self-absorbed behaviour and violence towards his girlfriends, this update makes you wonder how the unlikeable character made it as far as he did. After revealing little of note in the first half, the book gets juicy when recreating Brian's final days spent in the company of celebrities including Maurice Gibb, Steve Winwood and John Mayall at his country home. Theories about the guitarist's pool drowning remain a little haphazard, but Who Killed Christopher Robin? offers some sympathy for the little devil."
2,Really?,"Did y'all read the same book I did? I found this book read like a script instead of fluid story. The characters were described, but their innermost thoughts that would have fleshed them out were never detailed. When I reached the part where the character Heath is being interviewed by a talk show host named Orca (Oprah?), I'd had enough."
4,Warm and entertaining.,"Leap Year is an amusement designed to be entertaining, and it most definitely is. It is a warm, occasionally funny book. While it makes use of plot contrivances and some stock characters, its main players stay in character, and transcend the ""amusement"" genre to some extent."
3,need help,"I am looking for this picture from Herb Ritts: ""Jacqui Agyenpong 1, Miami 1997"". Can anyone tell me on which book from this author I can find it? Tks. Massimo"
3,Fits a GS500E motorcycle.. sorta,"The filter fits fine. The oil filter cover seal, the odd shaped oring, does not. Its about 10% too small. I guess if you soaked it in oil and stretched it a bit, you may be able to get it in there... but I re-used my original, torques tot he right tightness, and watched for leaks."
1,Not mat spray if there is no sprayer!,"May be an ok product but I recieved no sprayers. Contacted two entities for help but they passed the buck. Oh well, RETURN! regretfully."
3,okay,"struggled in the beginning with the pump and lock. indicators should be more visible. when spraying, liquid tends to spill over the sides. no biggie but a bit messy."
3,Intersting though not all-inclusive,"I have read the four books by Graham Thomas and while I find them somewhat lacking, they are interesting nevertheless. My main complaint is the lack of development with the characters. Yes, we seem to get to know Erskine Powell to some extent, but never fully. Since characterization is important to this reader, I find this to be somewhat of a detriment.However, the settings and explanations of them are interesting. Having never been to the Highlands or Cornwall, I enjoyed that aspect immesnsely. If you are a reader looking for great forensic detail you will also be disappointed in this series.All in all, these books are a quick and easy read. Unfortunately, I have been spoiled by the writings of Peter Robinson and these do not compare. That does not mean they are not worth reading though. They are enjoyable in their own right."
4,Malice Strikes Again!,"A Scotland Yard inspector with malice towards growing things (while his wife is out of the country) is presented with two seemingly unrelated murders. The characterization and interaction is interesting and sometimes fun (like the superior we love to hate). The settings are wonderful - set out in technicolor - and the reader will be hungry for curry (why, there is even a recipe thrown in!) Not quite as delightful and charming as M.C. Beaton's Hamish MacBeth or Rhys Bowen's Constable Evan Evans books, but a clever cozy nonetheless."
4,Great Read,"If you like British Mysteries, you will love Malice in London! Great characters, great plot. This is my first Graham Thomas, but not my last. A page turner!"
5,Great pair of shoes,"This is a great pair of shoes -- comfortable, cute and casual. I get compliments on these all the time!"
5,Outstanding customer service!,I placed an order with Shoemall and they were out of stock. I then gave them a bad review for advertising shoes they were no longer selling. The company called my home to apologize for the inconvenience. I was really impressed with their customer service and I went ahead and placed 2 more orders. The shoes are so comfortable and I got them at a great price. This is a top rate company.
1,Major disappointment,"I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day. We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new! These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on. I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again, unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before."
2,Uncomfortable,Looks pretty good but uncomfortable for outdoor activities. My feet hurt after walking 5 hours.
1,Meditations upon the meaning of 'landscape',"I was attracted by the title of this book; there's so much to be learned by observing the suburban or rural landscape, which most of us drive through without really noticing or reflecting upon it. Someday a wonderful book will be written on this topic, but this is not it. Instead, John Jackson presents us with a series of 'musings,' for lack of a better word, about the vernacular landscape. At times, the writing takes on a stream-of-consciousness quality that leans too heavily toward personal reflection. Topics include the grid-road network of the US midwest, placement of county courthouses within town plans, the history of the 'box house,' evolution of the Arts & Crafts style of architecture, and the author's experiences in the US Army in Europe during WWII. Intertwined among these topics are passages in which the author reflects upon the notion of 'landscape' and what it means to him."
4,'100 % Pure Bollocks' (Cleopatra) Various Artists - 6-CD box set,"Six disc, 100 track box set - whew! That's a lot of listening! Good collection of many prime punk bands, many of which were there in the very beginning. Artists like the Sex Pistols, Barracudas, the Exploited, Runaways, Johnny Thunders, Iggy Pop, the Stranglers, the obscure punkers Splodge, the Damned, Sham 69, MC 5, Stiff Little Fingers, UK Subs, Captain Sensible, Dead Kennedys, Theatre Of Hate, Electric Sex Circus, Four Skins and too many more here to mention provide a one-on-one course of pure punk rock and clearly what it means to the old school fans. Recommended."
5,Includes a great remix,I like the song but love the Timbaland remix.It has the perfect beat for bellydance.Wish that version had gotten more air play.
5,I really like it,"This song is really good. It makes me want a few things. I like bein the ""other woman"" cuz I'm bout it!!!!!!"
2,The Art of Painted Furniture,"Was looking for techniques and colors used. Came away with more questions than answers. Was more about the author and her work than I wanted to know. There was a whole page of Feng Shui and color; which, must have been filler stuff. Question: Does she apply stain over the painted surfaces on all of her items?I will have to say I really liked her work. The pictures were excellent."
2,to juvenile,I was disappointed in this book. It seemed more of an advertisement for her work then anything else. There is not a lot of instruction in this book and the pictured examples are fun but tend to get juvenile. I was hoping for more tecnique.
2,What happened to Mad Kap,"Coke went on to form Colored Section a little later in the 90s, which had more of traditional west coast type of vibe, but was still really dope. Also, the best song I ever heard from Mad Kap was a really great track over a Michael Jackson sample that did not make it on the album, and that I've never been able to track down in digital form. I just have it on a recorded tape from the Friday Night Flavas (Baka Boyz-KPWR)."
4,Great! Surprised they don't make music anymore.,This is a great CD from 1993. I think these guys were ahead of their time. I'm very surprised that they aren't making music anymore (at least not as Mad Kap). They sound a little like the Beatnuts. Find out more about them on AllMusic.com.
5,diadora mens Equipe leather,this is the third pair of the shoe that i am ordering...excellent shoe...great for casual wear and for athletics...extremely durable and looks great...one of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn.
3,A Fair Buy,"This book is a pretty fair buy and help. The thing I didn't like was the fact that 2/3 of the book is history of different cookbooks. I didn't personally want this. I just wanted prices of collectible cookbooks, so there weren't near enough books for my liking. The listings that were there were easy to understand and look up."
2,Destroy Like Nazi's,"Fight Club is shocking, colorful, Matrix like, full of technical magic, but it stinks. The whole idea that Corporate America stifles freedom is bogus. Most folks put in 8 hours and go home to kiss the wife and kids, smoke pot, or ride their motorcycles. In truth, human activity after 5 in America is diverse. Wasted, gray lives, that's what its like in Socialist countries. So what do these fighting young men do to combat Corporate Fascism, they kill and destroy like Nazi's. Clear thinking there, hey! Yeah, Brad Pitt is believable as a handsome, cocky, cool guy. He had to use all his talent to stretch for that role. This movie is everything that's wrong with the Left Wing Intelligentsia on the East and Left Coast."
3,NOT OSCAR MATIERAL But Decent,"This film is a DECENT film.. so I'll say that much. I think this film has been OVER Hyped.. But it is a VERY good film....But maby this is just to MTV or TO TEENY 90's movie for me. but one thing this film that does horrorbly at is Turning a COmedy into a drama.I mean, THe comedy part is SO FUNNY! I couldn't stop laughing... then it gets into this very deep dark drama, and it's just a little crude.I say rent this film before buying."
2,What the...?!...But...?...How...??!!!,"Don't get me wrong. I love the violence and the delapidated house they live in reminds me of my college dorm.But once you find out the ""secret"" revealed in the movie, you realise that its not only bizarre, but physically IMPOSSIBLE!"
2,Weak Film!! Brad Pitt is extremely Irritating,"okay, Edward Norton was good in his performance, I'll admit that. But this film fully glorifies my dislike for Brad Pitt's so-called acting. What can I say, All my friends recommended this to me by saying how awesome it was and how much I would love it. I personally thought it was pretty weak. The ending was extremely stupid. I'm usually very open to cult-films, but this one has to go!"
3,Gave it as a gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew ... at his request ... and I haven't heard any complaints, so I guess it was all right with him."
1,Nothing much to say,"Saw this last night.....Could have possibly thought it was ""ok"" but not necessarily my cup of tea until the very last 5 minutes of the film. HORRIBLE. JUST HORRIBLE.First movie that I can honestly say I wish there were a no star option here."
1,"Empty, Absurd, and somewhat dangerous","Major Hollywood Studios have to make money. That's not bad. That's why they pay megamillions to startlets; because they know they magnet attraction to young audiences, that have money, and can go twice(?) to see a movie. That's why Bradd Pitt is here: to get that audience.But where's the film? What's the morale? Get punched, humiliated, try to do the same and then feel better?Or: Let's don't care anymore, just bribe our bosses, get some easy money and travel thru the world creating clubs where human beings are denigrated constantly.This is a dangerous vehicle. If you are bored with your life, go and hit another one: he will like it.Parabole of modern life? Grasping excitement? C'mon, get real!"
1,never buy instant video,i got ripped off thinking i was buying the dvd. now im stuck with this crappy online version that needs to load every 10 minutes. im finished with amazon
4,Pretty good.,"Not too shabby. After reading some pretty bad reviews about this paticular seller i expected the worst, fortunatley, i recieved exactly what they said i would. Disks were in great condition but some of the original artwork wasnt there (about half). other then that it was a great buy, arrived in about half the time they predicted at a bottom line price, i couln't have bought this movie (fight club) cheaper at a yard sale.I am jack's happy consumer."
4,Wrong version,The description says its this version was released in 2000 but the one I got was released in 2003. The 2003 doesnt have a booklet that the 2000 version has and it is Glossy istead of flat. Other than that it was in great condition and it shipped fast.
5,MASTERPIECE,"There's not one positive message in this movie. It's dark, tense, sufffocating. But the director did it with his heart. As for Norton, nothing is needed to be said. He has come to stay."
5,Love this movie.,"I've always meant to buy this movie, I couldn't resist this price. Great addition to my library. And it's Blu-Ray!!"
5,Great movie,"Fantastic movie based on a fantastic book. It's a little bit different than the book (story-wise), but all the changes were good adaptations to the media difference. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both play their characters perfectly."
5,Best movie ever,I think this is the one of the best movies ever created .Just crazy intense and so much stuff to learn from this movie .
4,The man did all right after the mess of Alien 3...,"I know he was knee capped by the main actor -weaver- and chocked by the production -20th Century-, but I still don't like what he did in the end.Outside of that 'Fight Club' was a daring ""art house"" movie and I am grateful that it finally came out in a medium that almost equaled what I saw when it first came out."
5,The Cambece Family loves it.,"Edward norton is awsome in this. The whole premis of the movie is great and i think everyone should own this movie,just because it is so great."
5,Tyler Durhem rules!,"A wildly exaggerated black satire delivered with a wink and a glossy black eye. Ed Nortan's corporate drone is the perfect persona to set off Brad Pitt's wonderfully witty and outrageously glam character Tyler Durhem who lives life on his own terms. A stylish and hip treatment of an age old dilemma: How does one avoid being owned / controlled by corporations and losing one's inner and outer self to plastic consumerism and wretched materialism.Brad Pitt once again throws himself (literally) into this role with full throttle gusto and is dressed so amazingly making Gaultier, D and G , Gucci and Dsquared (all euro high fashion envelope pushers) proud as all hell. Helen carter Borham is the single female presence and matches the fellas in her own delightfully twisted way, and has a bedroom scene with Brad that is as intensly violent as it is hilarious with a killer one liner. A high concept cinematic treat handled with twisted humor , high octane energy and comic book graphics ."
5,I am Jack's DVD review,"If you are like me then you didn't buy the pre-release machismo hype! If you are like me you listened, despite your usual good judgement, to all the idiot critics who called the movie a waste of time. If you are like me you rented the movie and felt cheated having missed it on the big screen. If you are like me you will buy the dvd version and watch it again and again and love it more each time. Your head'll collapse if there's nothing in it. Where is my mind? Way out on the water, see it swimming?"
2,MISLED BY AMAZON AND OTHER REVIEW SITES,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN DTS!!UNFORTUNATELY THIS DISC WAS NOT PROPERLY REVIWED BY AMAZON,IMDB,ETC.THIS IS THE SAME SET AS THE EARLIER TWO DISC SET.I'M MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.I HAD TO OPEN IT TO FIND THIS OUT AND WON'T BE ABLE TO RETURN IT.THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND DESERVES TO BE DONE CORRECTLY WITH DTS SOUND.BUYERS BEWARE."
3,"Morbid, interesting..awkward ending","Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star in this modern age morbid tale of discontent directed by David Fincher. ""Fight Club"" is an orginization that collects all the anger and discontentment of society into one large street fighting gang. Pitt (Tyler Durgin) is a sleezy projectionist/waiter that entrances Norton who is a low scale desk jockey working for some car company into joining his masquerade in the streets. The two become enthralled by their creation and soon fight club becomes a weekly ritual, and then, a daily one. Fight clubs begin to spring up across the country, and soon Durgin is a celebrity within the underworld. An uncanny relationship with a doped up drug adict teen aged girl tear the bonds between Norton in Pitt. The movie ends in a strange, apocalyptic and not very satisfying manner."
5,Doh! Why didn't I figure this out the first time?,"The answer is: It's too good of a movie. It makes you feel like you should have known what was up, but you never had a clue until the end. There is so many hints you almost feel stupid for not catching them. It is better understood the second time around. And even more so the third. Just give this movie a chance. And if you are human, it WILL disturb you."
5,Pitt and Norton at their best,"Another great film in the list of good Brad Pitt movies. He made a great career change starting with Seven and has yet to dissapoint. Norton also gives a great performance, which is par for the course with him. Kinda dark and violent, only a good date movie if your girlfriend is into S&M."
5,Freakin' Awesome!!,"Fight Club is honestly the most underated movie of the 90's. After I first viewed it in theaters I was completely in awe. And then I watched the DVD commentary and it only solidified my belief how layered and complex the movie really, truly is."
1,Fight club,"This movie was the most weirdest movie I've ever seen , I could'nt understand nothing about the movie at all >"
2,It's OK about sums it up,I thought about turning it off half way through but I stuck with it. Some interesting plot twists. But I wish I had streamed it free rather than paying for it. I feel like I wasted the money
3,Psychological Thriller!,"Very dark, very scary, very brutal.The acting was amazing and the premise horrifying. I guess I'm getting too old to appreciate, or don't want to believe, the horrors we humans are capable of."
3,Scuffle Club is more like it,"Although I went to see this movie expecting to see a lot of action, I can't say I was dissapointed by the lack of it. The characters are so finely drawn that you don't realize that nothing 'exciting' happens for the first 2/3rds of the movie. It is however a great date movie because of its slow pace (wink wink)."
5,"""The 1st rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about F.C.""",Tyler's words coming out of my mouth. Do not review this movie or you will be breaking the first two rules of Fight Club. This is all I have to say.
3,Surprise Ending,"I like Brad Pitt (who doesn't?) so decided to take a chance and rent it. I only gave it three stars because there were times when I was bored. It became very interesting closer to the end when the truth came out. I must admit, though, the cool part was the commentary and when it pointed out various ""hidden"" aspects of the film. This is a great movie to watch when you feel like you're going crazy. You'll realize your sane when you compare your life to Edward Norton's."
3,An Original Plot..,"Fight Club is one of the most weird movies I have ever seen. The whole plot is so unreal, which makes the movie amusing. It's an original movie where Edward Norton plays a very good role. Watch this movie, I't will permenetly stay in your mind..."
2,Overrated,"This cult fav seems to appeal to the outsider and the peculiar. Violent , unsettling, repulsive and filled with gaps in logic. Normal folks need not apply."
5,This is one fight you won't want to miss,This was an amazing movie. I watched it once and then immediately bought it. I have watched it several times subsequently and have caught something new each time. The other reviewers of this film have done a fine job of telling you what this movie is about. So I'll just say to this you- this film is a MUST SEE (for men and women). Don't let the trailers and the title scare you. This movie is not at all what you think it is. Pitt and Norton were fabulous. And the ending is just unreal. See it. Buy it. Tell your friends about it.
4,Fight Club,"Fight Club I was fairly surprised with. I did not expect it to be as psychological as it was, and was sort of taken back by the whole story. I guessed the ending WAY before it happened, but it was still in a way surprising. The story, along with Pitt and Norton's performances make this movie well worth seeing and one of the most rememberable movies I have seen in quite a while."
5,One Word,"I will give you one word by which you can judge the social discourse in which this film engages in: rationalization. Go read Max Weber.Another sociological theory in which this movie carries the spirit of is the whole idea of habitus of the body (read Pierre Bourdieu, especially Distinction).This film engages in a strong sociopolitical discourse of rationalization in modern society and the inescapability of the ""iron cage""That being said, I think this is an extremely well done movie, and a very good book (though I do think the movie is better). Perhaps one of Edward Norton's finest (up there with American History X)."
5,Masterpiece,"This one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory. The movie, unlike what the title displays, is much more than fighting. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were absolutely brilliant. ""Fight Club"" keeps the audience on its toes, with its many changes and variations. If you are going to watch a movie, you had better watch ""Fight Club."""
1,I did not like it at all,"This is the same 'sick while pretending to be intelligent'movie as 'Natural born killers' or 'Hannibal'. I hatewhen producers try to dressviolence addressed to our lowest instincts as somethingintelligent.I've borrowed this movie from a friend. I did not like it at all.First there was too much violance in the movie, much more than necessary for the plot. And contrary to e.g. ""Pulp fiction""where I did see the purpose - here I did not and I simplyfelt sick after that.The final nail for me were the final scenes remininding September11. I will never watch this movie again."
1,One Of My 10 Worst Ever,"I've sat here and read at least 5 other reviews, and wondered if maybe I had rented the wrong movie. This movie took 45 minutes just to get started, and then once it got started, had no real substance. They took a 'Pulp Fiction' twist and made a root canal more enjoyable. The actors/actresses are the only reason I would see to rent this movie, let alone buy it. It's sad to see such talent wasted on a truly boring and uneventful movie."
1,Yuck !,Isn't life too short to waste time on this kind of movie ? The fact that there are people who give more than two stars on this stuff is simply a proof that the end of the world is near.
1,Retarded,"Naturally, there are the people that will hate the movie for its violent content. I tend not to discriminate when it comes to violent content in movies. For example, Saving Private Ryan used violence to send a sincere message. Unfortunately, I cannot right-mindedly suggest that Fight Club had the same purposes in mind. The violence seemed quite sensationalized and the movie seemed not to emphasize the negative aspect of the 'Fight Club'. One example of this sensationalization is when they are destroying the businesses of various people through mischief. The music says, ""Laugh, this is funny!"" but it is obviously not. Perhaps the director went astray from what the author of the book had in mind, because I saw little seriousness in the subject with which ""Fight Club"" supposedly grapples with."
1,Stupid movie!!!,Fight club is one of the most over hyped movies that I have ever seem.Stupid plot. Stupid plot. Stupid plot. Stupid plot. Stupid plot.Pass on this movie. Don't waste your money.
4,Messes with your mind!,"I didn't want to watch this movie at first, but I was at a friend's house and he told me I had no choice : ""You're a psychology major; you're going to watch it and you're going to like it."" I am Joe's complete surprise over how great this movie is. No doubt the film is incredibly violent; it's not for the weak of stomach. But the storyline made so much sense and the twist at the end was awesome. By the way, the book was also very good and gives you even more insight into the narrator's thoughts and especially his past."
4,Style over Substance,"Fight Club is an odd film. It's visually and styilistically impressive. There are many great shots, like when the main charecter is seen walking through a catalouge, or the entertainment brought by the icey cavern and the penguin who encourages Norton to ""slide!"" And the sciript is full of great lines, like tyler's well done prophesy of the new world orderHowever, the film falls on some levels. The goal of Durden makes the movie seem somewhat pretentious. And the film just has a somewhat, <i>wrong</i> feel to it, in an indescribable way. Of course, that could have been what they soughtHowever the style of the film is great."
5,Classic life-breaking-out-of-chains story,"Classic, awesome. Corporate, mental, social ""chains"" -- you are more than you think ou are.But someone told me this was a love story. I still can't see that."
5,Nihilism and Anarchy....,"Some of these reviews are very sheltered. Yes, the film is violent, yes, the message is against society, but these are valid forms of expression, and I think it weaves an excellent story which, culminating at a huge suprise (if some of the reviewers would keep their mouths shut...). The DVD's features include just about EVERYTHING Fox has done with this movie (TV spots, etc.). Bottom line: It's a must have...so long as you don't fear the truth."
4,A cult classic,"I didn't go see this movie in the theater. I thought it was going to be another Van Damn movie like Bloodsport. However, I was mistaken to my delight when I saw the DVD. The gritty color, interesting characters and of course the lovely Marla Singer.If you haven't seen this movie yet, now is the time."
4,Something Else,"If your looking for something unique in a nothing-new-under-the-sun hollywood, this is the film you should get. One of those few movies that you will enjoy watching and get you thinking at the same time."
5,Quite possibly the greatest film; genius movie,"... From the preview I first saw it didn't really seem to have much to it and I didn't really have any interest in it. When I finally did get around to seeing it (only because I really like Brad Pitt as an actor) I instantly fell in love with this movie. Not only was the acting superb, but the whole story was so slick and original. It just really blew me away, and then the DVD, don't get me started. The DVD is loaded with extras, hidden stuff, and even the case it comes in is awesome. Trust me, for those of you out there that think this is some stupid ""guy fighting"" movie, think again, there is so much more then you think. Yes, I am talking to the females out there, give it a look, trust me. Also check out David Finchers other movies (Seven, The Game, and the new one, Panic Room) great movies."
5,Not Just for the Guys,"I didn't see this movie at the theatre because of the way it was being marketed...which appeared to me as nothing more than a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other!Once I finally saw the movie, I realized that this doesn't even begin to explain the plot. A truly terrific movie with enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. Edward Norton does a wonderful job of portaying a ""lost soul"" out of place in today's society. Brad Pitt is wonderful in a performance that could have been so easily over the top.This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. It gets away from your standard cliched movies which seem to simply rehash plots older than movies themselves (for example...Gone in 60 Seconds...I don't think this movie had one original line or thought). Even if you think you know what Fight Club is about, you don't. I think the studios did a poor job marketing this film. It should appeal to anyone who truly enjoys something different."
5,Psychological Violence,"Do you enjoy movies that brim with psychological suspense and an almost incomprehensible plot?? Whether your answer is yes or no, you should currently have a list of movies engraved within your memory that fit the criteria. Are you grasping for answers?? Here are, in my opinion, several flicks that fit the bill. (""""Plulp Fiction,"""" ... """"Memento,,"""" ... """"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas,"""" ... ""The Last Broadcast,,"""" ... """"The Ring,,""""... """"True Romance"""" ... ""Resevoir Dogs""""... ""Four Rooms""""... """"The Usual Suspects""""... """"Seven""""... """"The Game""""... """"Dead Presidents""""... """"Apocalypse Now""""... take your pick... and enjoy."
5,thats all we are,"This movie makes sense in a crazy way. I think the writers and producers of this movie are trying to tell us something. After I watched this movie it made me think about how life is really is. Everything is like clockwork, like we're programmed to think and live a certain way. That sucks!!! This movie really opened up my mind a little bit."
5,Fight Club,Im 14 and saw this film recently. It was a very complex film with an amazing twist that just seemed to make sense. Edward Norton's narration was flawless and Brad Pitt slotted into role as he usually does. Suave and stylish direction gave this film a raw edge. Gets better with every viewing!
1,Hugely Overrated Dreck,"An interesting beginning gives way to pointless violence, childish pranks and plot twists for the sake of plot twists. I could kick myself for sitting through the entire mess. I hated this movie."
1,Repulsive Garbage -- The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,Avoid this waste of tape and time at all cost.
1,Fight Club is crap for Suburban Wannabes,"I gave this piece of crap one star becasue the site wouln\dn't let me give it less. ""Fight Club"" is the movie for you if you're into the closet bound, homoerotic fantasies of a schizophrenic who is not capable of having sex with a woman unless he imagines that another guy is doing it. What really scares me is that the whimps that like this garbage are allowed to walk the streets wihtouth a keeper. If they're so into fighting why don't they put on gloves and get into a ring. Because they'd get the life beatren out of them, that's why. This kind of junk-- and Neil LaBute's ""In The Company of Men"" are supposed to be ""real guy"" movies. Real eunuch movies is more like it."
5,Incredibly Deep and Well Thought Out Movie-One of the Best,"This movie for some reason has been regarded as a violent movie about some men angry at each other. If you think this then you are far from right. This movie is increbibly deep. Its one of those movies that makes you think about life after you leave the theater(or your tv room in this case). This movie adds comedy to a powerful, insightful, and dramatical story line. I dont want to ruin the plot by telling you it but all i have to say is that brad pitt has the preformance of his carear(as that cool guy you girls all love) and edward norton delievers yet again another perfect insane individual. GO BUY IT......you wont be disatisfied."
2,AWFUL.... REALLY BIZARRE.... MINDLESS VIOLENCE,"I'm sorry folks, I just didn't ""get it."" The acting was great and the story was original, and for that I give this movie 2 stars. But other than that, why watch this movie? It's just a bunch of bizarre, mindless violence. Is watching people beat each other's faces into a bloody pulp for fun supposed to be ""art"", perhaps?Don't get me wrong - because I like actual boxing. But this wasn't boxing. This movie was just plain sadistic. Or masochistic, take your pick. It was one of the strangest and most outright bizarre movies ever.Sorry people, I just didn't get it. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Mostly Worthless,"Despite a few key scenes and decent one liners, 'Fight Club' is simply self-indulgence at its peak (until Donnie Darko of course). Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they neglected to include direct quotes from the book (written by the god-awful king of pseudo intellectuals Chuck Palahniuk).Though I did think it was funny when Meatloaf's brains fell onto the floor."
2,"Beware, this is not a truly ""fun"" movie","My adult son recommended American History X, a movie I would never normally watch, but he reommended it so highly that I watched it and loved it (violent, yes, but such a great story and so well done). He also reocmmended Fight Club -- um, not the same thing! Certainly well done FOR WHAT IT IS, but not a fun movie, hard for people like me to follow the story or see the point of the story (like The Matrix, and American Beauty)and brutally violent and unpleasant. To each their own!"
1,I can only echo others' comments...,"""If you don't like this movie, you must be in denial.""""...you must be a consumerist tool.""""...you must not have the balls to accept reality.""Great reasons to see a movie? Well, they're the only reasons to see Fight Club.Read a few of the 5-star reviews. Notice that no one who says, ""This movie made me think,"" can quite articulate WHAT it made them think? Notice how defensive and snarly they get at the thought that anyone might NOT think it was the premier social statement of our time?Anyone who buys into this mess enough to call it a great piece of cultural commentary is in bigger denial than anyone in the film. See it only if you really believe not seeing it will turn you into a sissy-man."
3,Pretty entertaining film is all it is. Stop overrating this,"Alright, well I guess I missed the part where this was supposed to be one of the most amazing movies ever made. Why did people have orgasms over this movie? This isn't even that bad, and in fact I have nothing negative to say about it, just dumbfounded as to what all the hype is about.I feel like I was the sole person that watched the ""negative"" of the film, while everyone else got to see the developed positive. I don't really have anything creative or witty to say here, because again, I don't have any criticisms. So uh, yeah, if you like psychological/thriller/drama type movies, I guess check this out? Don't expect it to be life changing though."
2,Low Blow,"A good looking movie. Edward Norton is always watchable. The plot is absolutely different. We're rooting for this underdog theme. But in the final round,the audience is hit with a low blow that can only be vocalized as disbelief on a grand scale. If you watch it at home, it's an interesting failure. But for me at ringside, I was robbed."
5,Fight Club: BEST MOVIE EVER,"Seriously, if you haven't seen this, stop reading and go buy it NOW. Because: ""Only after you've lost everything, that your free to do anything."""
5,"Smart, violent and gripping","First off, do not watch this film if someone has explained the ending. Its a gritty, violent cut of the life of a middle of the road 'suit'. The story will blow your mind and the philosophy is amazing. This is one movie you must see."
2,Horrible Book,I may be going against the grain by saying this but I absolutely hated this book and movie. Such a horrible plot line.
5,One of my favorites,"I recommend that everybody watch this movie at least once. Some are going to like it, some are going to hate it. But to me, it is an awesome story. Im not going to say it made me think deeply but it did make me wonder how I didnt see it coming."
3,good movie,i loved it my wife hated it. something is up with that we usually have similar taste in movies. also bob has man boobs. lol
5,"Consumer-Capitalism, Primitivism, Culture Jamming and Soap..","Chuck Palahniuk's novel captures the growing discontent with consumer-capitalism with this dark story. Fincher's adaption is excellent, as are the performances of Norton, and Pitt.There is so much touched on in this movie, it's hard to list. One major theme being the nihlism of modern society - and the all-too American obsession with acquiring material possesions to fill a spiritual and emotional void in one's life.Norton's character (an IKEA obssesed yuppie) finds an outlet for his angst in late night brawls with others who share his disillusionment. Things escalate from there and culminate in a plot to bring about ""economic equalibrium,"" and a neo-tribal state harkening back to simpler times. This work is a serious social critique.Make no mistakes; its a Hollywood production all the way, but there is a lot being said here. If you like this, I'd recommend reading some more of Palahniuk's stuff, and ""TAZ"" by Hakim Bey."
4,Great movie,"Always liked this movie. It wasnt a box office smash or anything, but its grown hugely as a cult classic. Every guy can quote at least 2 lines from this movie."
5,The First Rule Of Fight Club IS...,".. You DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!A brilliant translation of the book, and the special features are a treat for anyone interested in filmmaking.A sweet book, a sweet movie, and a sweet DVD.A media trumph, in my humble opinion, and they didn't have to sell out to make it happen!"
5,"Great movie, great set","All those who are upset over the ""fact"" that this is basically Corporate America Hollywood Bigshots pretending to hate themselves need to settle down. Its a darn fine movie, and anyone who's tired of cliches (judging by disgruntled reviews of Pearl Harbor, EVERYBODY) should be grateful that these types of films have managed to get studio backing. I've never seen the actors, narrative, music and visuals blend together better than they do in Fight Club. So who's ready for Panic Room?"
5,"Bare Fisted Brawls, Deep Philosophical Meanings","The first Rule of Fightclub...wathc this movie. From begiining to end this visually stunning and superbly directed film takes you for one wild ride. Beneath the bare fisted brawls and raging choas sprawls an intense web of deep philosophical meaning. Fight Club tackles the issue of a mans place in society where the onslaught of the politically correct and the idea of the ""sensitive man"" has left him wondering who we are and who we should be. A profoundly moving yet visceral film, Fight CLub delivers. I give this movie five big stars. Top tan movie. I also highly recommend the book, by Chuck Palahniuk for a thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,A Cult Classic!,"Interesting tale of what happens when white collar worker get bored. With nothing better to do, two guys have a fight and it draws a crowd. This seems to start a new fad where accountants/lawyers/stockbroker types get together and watch two of them go at it. Eventually, guys are showing up to work all bruised and there seems to a knowing when one sees the other.As the movie progresses, we are not sure what is real and what is in the mind of one of the main characters.There have been other movies that seem to depict fights in back rooms and garages (Jean Claude Van Damme did Lionheart). This movie is definately the best of the bunch."
1,A little anarchists dream come true,"Fight Club is an attrroctious movie that reeks of 15 minute fame. The idea that all working class people can expect nothing good out of their miserable little lives and that we all need to be reduced to nothing but individuals who are truly no better then everybody else doesn't sit well, nor does the sight of men with large breasts or stealing liposuctioned fat to make soap. Elements like this are true signs of the 15 minute fame mark. Had it been kept with the premise of fighting to work out tension it could have been better. Brad Pitt also makes for probably the most tetched character in movie history. This movie is hidious and goes on WAY too long."
3,Blue Ray disc is irritating,"When you press stop, and want to press play again to continue the movie, the disc starts back from the very beginning. Pressing stop once does not hold the disc in the chapter you were watching. Basically, the movie reverts back to start up mode as if you had just placed and disc into the player to begin watching. Very frustrating and unnecessary."
1,Pulp Fiction all Over Again,"This movie was a stylish version of a baby throwing a hissy fit, and suffers from pulp fiction syndrome( which is having no story and wasting a would be good movie on whatever the director was thinkin that day). Nothing made sense, it had no good fights( and a movie called fight club should have good fights), and it was loaded with smut. O yeah it also had a twist at the end which was unessasarily stupid. Overall its a 2 out of a 10. What a waste of talent."
2,You just think it's powerful because of the sex and violence,"First of all, this movie starts out great, I must admit. Butthen about halfway in, the structure starts breaking down, the moviegets very slow, plot holes get bigger, the story's tone changes from satire to pure fantasy, and the twist at the end is inexplicable and ridiculous....its use of sex and violence is no holds barred and unabashedly in your face. So what? I see that kind of stuff all the time. It's not what makes a movie good. This movie is so disorganized and flawed--a mess, a mess, a mess, I can't stress how much of a mess this is."
4,happy,"dvd works. package not disintegrated. it is as it claimed to be, who wouldn't be happy with such an outcome?"
4,Movie was gift,Recipient was happy with this -- it was asked for. Purchased movie to go along with book as a gift.
3,"Over-rated, to be sure","I read somewhere that if you are an anarchist, you will love this film. And? So what if you're not an anarchist? What if you're squeamish about physical violence (like me), and repulsed by over-hyped, overly dark, overly acted future ""cult"" films? I guess that leaves pretentious metro-sexual artistes, brilliant anti-social aspiring Bernie Madoffs, and worshippers of Brad Pitt (and oh those pecs!). Fight Club will make you think though, if you don't get too grossed out to think. But seriously, do you really need to see people get the crap beat out of them to start having serious thoughts about your life? Hell, you can see that for free on youtube. Or just go to any ""real fighting videos"" website. Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I just prefer a good old fashioned Bond film with some style and ahem, good looking women as opposed to..well. Oh, and the attempts at humor here really fall short. Other than that General, how was the siege of Moscow?"
3,First 2/3 is 5 Star last 1/3 is a solid 1,"Fight club gets off the ground brilliantly with Ed Norton playing a severely lonely man that finds companionship through support groups ranging from people with TB to testicular cancer. It is funny, and initially feels like it could be the smash breakthrough brilliant film of 1999. It continues strong through the 2/3 mark, at which time audience members are on their seats with excitement at just how well done everything is. . . and then comes the crash. The ""reveal"" of Norton's psychiatry is insulting to the intelligent viewer and the film cannot deliver on the ""6th Sense"" verses ""Usual Suspects"" approach that it tries. As we say in Hollywood, and audience can always forgive a poor start with a great end. . . but a fantastic start with a terrible end will leave the audience hollow. This is the answer to why people hate the film. Truly disappointing given how awesome it is initially."
4,**Fight Club- the novel vs the movie**,"I saw Fight Club in the theaters before I read the book. The movie was so powerful to me that I wanted to see if there was more. The idea of the movie was to make everyone credit go to zero which would created total chaos. In the novel, Tyler just wanted to have control over eveything. If you enjoyed this movie, I suggest you read the novel because it is even crazier than the movie. i cann't wait to see what extra, possible deleted scenes the DVD will have.... latas......"
2,Not nearly as intelligent as it tries to be.,"i must first start by saying that ed nortons acting in this movie was tremendous. however, that is this entire pictures only redeeming quality. my friend has a trained woodchuck that i think could have given a better theatrical performance than brad pitt. why he was cast in this role is beyond me. at least he wasnt trying to effect an accent (seven years in tibet). on to the plot, it really wasnt as original as people would have us believe. a man gets addicted to attending group therapy sessions. OH, THE IRONY!! dont patronize me. and after the sixth sense's ending, this one was almost predictable, and not nearly as satisfying. i am anxiously awaiting the time when brad pitt's career goes the way of billy ray cyrus'."
4,A perfect Guy movie,"what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said already? great story, very interesting plot, and oh yeah a stampede of ""Tyler Durdenism."" After watching this movie my view on the world and myself has changed. I turned into a Chuck Palahniuk fan and finished reading Choke and Fight Club and now reading Survivor. The book of the movie is a little different.The acting in the movie is good. Not the best for either of the main actors and therefore no 5 stars, but good nonetheless. The philosophies of Tyler Durden might be a little depressing and can make one feel worthless, but very interesting nonetheless. Well, great movie. I have not heard a bad thing about this movie. And if anyone says it's a bad movie...then he or she really doesn't know a good movie when they see it."
2,Great movie ruined by a crushingly disappointing weak ending,"I hated this film. I use the word ""hated"" because I was having such a great time watching it, and then there's this ridiculousy unfortunate ending that does a horrible diservice to the rest of the material. If you're the type of person that gets irked when the flick you're watching winds up having no pay-off whatsoever, avoid this"
4,the yardstick of un...civilization ...,"I would review this product, but it would go against everything that Tyler Durden stands for .... Do not buy this movie, the things you own end up owning you, instead go out meet a person of the opposite sex and do not give authority to those who claim it... including this s***** review .I would say kind regards, but I am my alter ego right now ..."
5,Well Worth The Wait,"Thought it seemed that ""Fight Club"" might never come out on Blu-Ray, I was so happy to finally see it appear for pre-order on Amazon. The sound and video on this Blu-Ray edition really takes advantage of the capabilities of Hi-Def. Everything here is top-notch and worth the money, even if you already own this on DVD. Don't hesitate any longer, buy it now!"
4,the first rule of fight club is talk about fight club,"this movie is great! for once we see a great movie that summarizes heindigger's philosophy concerning technology. confused? in any case this is a great movie that is both funny and enlightening. if u enjoy watching a good ""down to earth"" movie then this is the movie for you. i think norton did a great job, as well a pitt. the movie is a bit graphic but its necessary to show the true impact of what is being told. and with 2 dvd's and at this price this is definetly a win win situation fun and packed with extra bonus material."
5,Fight Club Blu Ray,"The package came as shown, and very quickly. I had this on dvd, but on blu ray it is like a whole different movie. Not all movies transfer well, but this movie was made for blu ray. TONS of extras, both from the original dvd, and several new to this release. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes movies that actually make you think. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are awesome in this."
1,Tripe,"Yes, I'm a dude, and yes, I did see past its violence. And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that. To justify violence by millions of air-headed jocks is wrong. Let the negative feedback come on!) of 3584689 users found this review helpful"
1,ZERO stars-possibly the most overrated film ever,"Wow, violence exists, people can fight and they can get hurt and learn things about themselves! But don't talk about it! People who are impressed by this movie might want to read a few books instead of trying to learn life lessons from bad movies.If it weren't for prepubescent males with more testosterone than brain cells, this movie would have received no attention at all. A nice performance by Norton, but nothing else to recommend it. Those individuals who have written reviews stating that this movie is thought provoking or intellectually intense clearly are lacking any substantial intellectual horsepower.The book, while nothing special, is infinitely better than the movie."
1,Waste of time.,"A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book. Why read the book when we are trying to watch a good movie? Let's be honest here. The movie has a lot of fans but it is a bad movie to an average person who is happy with life. I watched it thinking it is a modern classic or something, but what a disappointment. Don't watch the movie unless you have nothing to do."
1,Completely Inane,This pathetic movie is one of the most pointless that I have ever seen.It is full of lots of meaningless violence and little else. The plot is disjointed and completely pathetic. The only movie that I have ever seen that is remotely as worthless is 'Napolean Dynamite'.I would not recommend this to anyone. It is a waste of over two hours of one's precious time.
1,"If you think this movie is ""deep"", you aren't","An immeasurably bad movie. The apparent audience for this film is the same group of pre-teen boys toward which Carl's Jr focuses their burger ads. If you think this movie is good, find an adult and have them explain to you why this is complete and utter bovine excrement.I've had the misfortune to see much of this movie twice and it just gets worse. Bad writing, bad acting, lack of substance and a complete dissasociation from reality make this a stinker for the ages.My theory is that Brad Pitt didn't want Seven to be known as his worst movie so he did Fight Club."
5,Best twist in a film ever,"Every one expected this film to simply be a simple film with over the top graphic violence, however anyone who has seen the film would have to agree that this isn't the case. The fighting part of the film is simply a subplot, with the main plot being one of a psycholigcal insite one mans warpped brain. This is quite simply an excellent film with a plot which will quite simply knock you back and I recomend you watch it, this is one of bratt's best achievements to date, proving he isn't simply a man of muscle but truely can act and can do it well!"
5,FIGHT CLUB CAUSES AND CURES CONSUMERISM,What can I write about a movie I've seen at least 20 times in the last two months and spent over $300 on for a digitial movie player and DVD and VHS versions just so I could own it myself!From the first viewing I couldn't stop telling others about this mind bending trip through one man's consumer hell. Or about the solution to his problem personified by Tyler Durden. Not to mention the just-above-street-person-level character Marla who survives the trip and lives to tell about it. Maybe I am so intrigued because I am like the nameless narrator - looking for answers and finding them just below the surface of denial.As a forty-one year old Christian woman I don't take my movies lightly. This is not a movie you will forget.
5,It's hard to top this movie,"When I saw ""The Matrix,"" I thought I would never see a movie that could beat it. I was wrong. I had seen previews for ""Fight Club"" for almost a year. When I finally found a theater showing it, I bought a ticket. The movie was good enough for me to see it four times. The more I think about the movie, the more I see it happening in the real world. We are under control by businesses and corporations, and we need to let the world know it's not what we want. While going to the extremes this movie did is not advised, I believe this movie tells people to stand up for themselves."
2,Mean-Spirited,"I thought from the premise that this movie might be a sort of social commentary or offer some kind of existential insight into the modern human condition. Instead, I found it mean-spirited and confused."
2,A 15 Year Olds Objections to Fight Club,"Fight Club has all the right messages, but it delivers it in all the wrong ways. This movie is meant to be a social satire, supposed to make us think about our society. What we own owns us, not the other way around. Corporate America controls our lives. These are true messages, ones that I couldn't agree more with. The problem is, you can't degrade corporate America when you ARE corporate America. The great message in this film loses it's genuity when the movie is so hypocritical. 21st Century Fox produced this movie to make money, which is everything that this movie opposed. Open your eyes people. This movie is a fraud."
2,"Big, loud, gratuitous, and not as smart as it thinks it is","This movie claims to be philosophically deep. Yeah, right. You're not fooling me, Mr. Fincher. The philosophy here is quite shallow. Some interesting surface points are made about commercialism, but it's all just an excuse for Fincher to show off his 875 different camera angles and blow stuff up on screen."
1,Tyler would have wanted it this way...,"Tyler would have wanted me to give this a 1 star review. So I did. ;)Apparently, all of the other serious 1 star reviews, have no understanding of irony. Or, they cannot understand that there's a difference between portraying violence, and condoning it. It's sad that people with such sophisticated vocabularies have such a limited perspective."
5,This is how a DVD must be,"I bought this DVD without have seen this movie, only because my friends said it was soo cool. And they were right, this is one of those ""I've got to see this again"" movies... Even if violence is strong here, it's not the purpouse... it's just the path to show you something. The DVD has a really great presentation, I'd like all my DVDs to have this kind of case. They're using two DVDs, one for the Movie and the other for the extras... that's great. So, if you are not sure if you should buy this or not, don't hesitate and buy it right now."
5,Will make you want to breathe smoke.,"This movie rocks. this is the most unreal and amazing exploration of the real world ever committed to celluloid. this is more than a movie, this is an experience. Norton's hero, no name, big problems, shoots himself, brilliant.Pitt's Durden, hard, fast, funny, evil, shoots himself, brilliant.Helena Bonhanm Carter, looks like Robert Smith of The Cure, gets naked, says lots of funny stuff, brilliant. Meat Loaf, has huge breasts, beats guys up, brilliant. David Fincher, makes it all look fantastic and move nicely, brilliant.FIGHT CLUB..........BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!"
4,Belated Pop Culture Must,"Okay, so I've been in college since I was in kindergarten, or at least that's how it feels. Now that I've graduated my friends have taken turns dropping their jaws at my pop culture ignorance. Every week one of them exclaims, ""How have you not seen that?"" Which is how I ended up viewing this movie. I won't deny it's a little odd, but oh so quotable and one really can't beat Edward Norton. In my book he's a better actor than Brad Pitt, and he's no slouch either. If you're into psychology at all or beautifully unpredictable movies, you'll love this one."
5,"A film of equal parts physcology, philosophy and action","The first time I saw this movie I went into without any idea what it was about. After the credits rolled I left without any idea what life was about. There's lots to love about this movie, from the fight sequences to the back stories and even the scenes without much plot. There are plenty of reason to go back for more and the special features on the BluRay just add on top of that."
5,Great movie,no overacting. totally cool story about the mind being screwed up and conjuring images. really enjoyed watching it!
1,Not worth renting let alone buying.,This movie is a testament to the fact that Hollywood is running out of things to make movies about. This is a failed attempt to combine a few previously used successful movie ideas into a sleeper of a flick. The movie starts of slow and you lose interest by the time anything of moderate excitement happens. The hype is just hype. The only thing dumber that this movie is the kids who imitate it by beating each other up. A poor idea sold with Brad Pitt's name. Over-rated-take a nap.
1,Eh,"I must say I watched this movie when it first came out and was unimpressed. I went ahead and gave it another try and it still is horrible!!! The plot line jumps around following this secret club and when it ends you are grateful! Not a fan, the three rules of fight club are 1. do not watch this movie, 2. I warned you! and lastly 3. Are you glad it's over?"
1,Pure Garbage,"Save time and money by not seeing this worthless pile of slime. It is a disgusting, boring, horrid put together piece of film that is a insult to intelligence. Why do good actors like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton constantly make bad movie after bad movie?. This horrible movie rates lower than one star. Believe me. Don't waste any time on slime like this!."
1,Welcome to the decay of society.,"This film is a tragedy-- not as a film itself, but in that it exists in the first place. This is glorification of mindless violence-- unsubstantiated violence. The film is well made, and therein lies the problem. Films, by design, are mediums of manipulation. The better the film, the more convincing. This film forces/allows the audience to not only feel good, but inteligent and scholarly in their enjoyment of senseless violence. This film is an atrocity particularly because it is well made. To modify Robert McKee, this is a horrible story, well told. By all means, avoid this film unless you want to rationalize your disgusting and worthless existence."
1,Fight Club,this movie was a horrible movie I usually like david fincher's movies very unbelieveable how can his imaginary character be driving a car with him siting in the passengers seat and people in the back seat just a all around dissapointing movie
3,Beautifully Made But...,"This film is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, beautifully produced, and very well acted. Even Brad Pitt rises to the occasion.Unfortunately, all the gorgeous cinematography, brilliant editing, fabulous production, and splendid acting cannot disguise the essential emptiness and dreariness of a movie that has absolutely nothing to say.What I found most disturbing about the film, ultimately, was the fact that it seemed so completely certain that it had some kind of serious message to impart, something about masculinity and power and fascism. The fact that the film fails so spectacularly to add up to anything other than a well-brought-off music video is the most telling thing about it."
3,Stylish but mediocre,"Anyone wanting to watch hot guys get worked up wailing on each other should watch the indie thriller BLOODLUST instead. It was made with a low budget, as a tribute to late 70s horror films. It not only has a similar message, it IS the soap. A homeless guy with a digital camcorder made it, and its SO well done its crazy. A lot of the themes are the same in both, but BLOODLUST pulls it off without the help of a major star or studio. It goes for a more SHINING-like atmosphere, so dont expect a thrill ride- but in a lot of ways its way better than this late 90s holdover, which smugly takes on corporate America and slick products by ....well, BEING the thing it hates. Not awful, but very overrated. BLOODLUST, however, is very UNDERrrated and fans of this movie should check it out."
2,Pure Nihilism,"This film starts out with an interesting premise about a guy who's searching for meaning in his ordinary, boring life of conformity. It could have been a thoughtful film. Instead, it descends into a display of mindless anarchy and nihilism. This is an ugly film. Please don't waste your money and more importantly, your mind on this."
5,Everybody's breaking rules 1 & 2 of 'Fight Club'.....,"This movie is so good, it's still being hotly talked about and analyzed 5 years after it's release. This ought to tell the prospective viewer one thing: Here's a classic that should not be missed! True, some critics say there's too much gratuitous violence, but this is more than balanced by the dark comedy and social satire that pervades it. There's a definite philosophical undertone here that can't be ignored which adds to rather than detracts from the whole experience. Anarchy, fist fights, and mayhem were never so much fun to contemplate till 'Fight Club' came out. For the record, in an uncommon twist, I felt like the movie was much better than the book it was based on. Beyond a hard-hitting script, solid direction, and great acting performances turned in by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter what else can I say?"
4,Comment on our life illusions,"This was a edgy quirky movie which ultimately was a comment on the falsity and emptiness of our lives, that they are an illusion to deny the reality of death, and once we accept that reality, we are free...or are we? Virtuoso performance by Pitt and pretty close to the book...except the ending was a somewhat cheap cop-out, if not eerily presient on the falling buildings of 9/11."
5,the number 9,Fight Club is brilliant! An awesome display of both Camp and Violence wrapped in a script of potent dialogue and stealth Acting. No wonder it went right thru the consumers empty heads. There's quite simply too much food for thought here to be taken in on just one sitting at the dinner table. I am proud to announce I am on viewing number 9 and upon each sitting I consume a new unseen morsel. In tyler we trust! Pass the gravey and SLIIIDE!
5,"Love it, Hate it! No other option.","I'll keep this short. This is, without any doubt, the best film made since, well, probably Seven. I'm not going to explain plot or anything about the film other than... WATCH IT! NOW! Then... WATCH IT AGAIN! But now, the DVD. Well, in the future we'll probably get DVD's with more. Probably. But what we'll never get is such a complete, perfect package. But the thing is, if you love the film you've already got it. And if you hate it, all I can say is try watching it again. And for those who aren't quite sure, well. If you like ""no brainers"", if that's what really gets you going then this is probably not for you. And I sympathise. But if you like things a little different. If you like movies that make you think. Then you should love it."
3,You Have to See It to Believe It!,"Watching the film, ""Fight Club"" you are taken into the dark underworld of fighting for respect and honor. Overall, the movie is pretty good. The acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt is great (not to mention Brad Pitt's physique), and the movie really pulls you in to lives of the characters. The fight scenes are rather grisly, which will probably leave people turning away and wincing or peeking through their fingers.I don't want to give anything away, but the ending will leave you speechless. If I hadn't watched it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. For the ending alone, watch this movie!"
4,psycological thriller,"brad pitt starts fist fighting club.ed norton is his friend and one of the first members.then norton finds out that pitt has already started fight clubs all over america.then almost every man in the country is in a fight club.pitt,who makes his own soap,has access to explosives and plans to blow up skyscrapers in every major city in america.near the end of the movie there is a twist.is brad pitt really ed norton and norton really pitt?Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)"
5,First Rule...,Who doesn't love this movie? Everything about it is amazing! The quality on blu-ray is just the cherry on top!
5,What a DVD should be.,"This is what a DVD should be like. This disk is a beautiful work of art. Two disks, one with the main feature and the other with bonus materials. The bonus disk is extensive. Multiple angles, multiple audio tracks and many making-of features. The main disk is in Dolby Digital 5.1, and the sound is great, thanks to the THX enhancments. This disk is also a groundbreaker by adding in the THX calibration tests. Great idea. The only other option that I would want is a DTS edition or a THX EX track with the TEX THX opening. Other than that it is great."
4,Daring,"A daring film by Fincher, Pitt, and Norton. The disappointing ending prevents it from getting 5 stars, but taking on this subject makes that flaw forgivable."
5,Excelent Movie,This special anniversary edition of Fight Club is a MUST HAVE edition for those whose enjoy David Fincher and his master piece.
5,It's 2009 and it's still on my top 5 best moves ever made,"This film has defined an entire generation of corporate-working, material junkies whose spiritual path got cluttered with Ikea tables, television infomercials, and ball-less Ray Romano-like portrayals of what men should act like. Paul Palanuik's novel is perfectly adopted into an innovative visual masterpiece by David Pincher (who was at the height of his career, just came off of his other masterpiece - Seven). Throw in the acting talents of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton (who was also at the height of his career at the time with films like Primal Fear, American History X, etc) and Helena Bonham Carter and you got yourself a classic."
4,Needs serious thinking,"For a movie that seems to be a violent from the title or on the first viewing, a second viewing picking up the points gives a chance to understand a the true esseance of the underlying message. A movie looking violent seems rather philosophical when you see it with an open mind."
5,Really a thinking movie (Simply Incredible!),"Alright, alright, so everyone knows now that this is a really good movie. Well, perhaps not EVERYONE. So maybe I can change a few minds with this review...?WEll, this movie starts off looking nothing like a thinking movie, if you base your opinion solely on the titel and a lot of the trailer info that they gave. But as soon as you start watching it, you realize how much thinking the cast and crew did in it, and how much thinking you need to do to pick up on everything. And trust me, no single viewing will reveal everything! Also, this movie is borderline psychotic. And you feel THAT, too. By the end of this movie I was beginning to feel just as insane as our hero (played by Edward Norton). And the ending. Well, let's just say that the ending... Well, not to be stereotypical, but you have to watch it for yourself. And watch it you will. But remember, ""The first rule of Fight Club is never talk about Fight Club""."
4,Completly unexpected,"I rented this DVD the other day because I have seen all the other movies that my local video store had on DVD. I didn't really expect much, I liked Seven but didn't really think this movie would live up to it. Let me tell you, it did and more. I was completly amazed by the ending. I didn't see it coming. The whole movie confused me and I loved it. Its one of those rare movies you want to see over and over because you keep learning more each time through. Now I'm about to buy this movie and add it to my DVD collection so I can show it to all my friends who didn't expect it to be good. THe only problem I had with this film was that I couldn't just watch, I had to think too. I love thinking, don't get me wrong but my head hurt from trying to figure out the plot in the begining. Once its over though you will understand what happened."
5,This is Ed Norton's movie!,"Hands down Ed Norton is one of the most talented actors working today. He brings a film to a new level with his superb acting, even if the film itself may be lacking (i.e. Primal Fear, Rounders, and American History X). In terms of supplements this DVD is the best on the market. For a 2-disc set the bar is set extremely high. Fans of Fight Club and Supplement freaks will love this DVD!"
5,Why did i not see this in the Theater?,"This Movie was a suprise, and it is one of the best movies i saw in a long long time. but acording to the rules , I can't talk about the movie.. :-) well worth your time to see this one.."
5,Prepare to evacuate soul in 10...9...8...,"This movie will change your life. If you have never even seen it...buy the DVD. Even if you have a small collection, everyone will be asking you to borrow this dvd. It is that great. Just putting the movie aside, the dvd is number one. It has great packaging, great supplementary, and four great tracks. Even one with Chuck Palahniuk, the writer of Fight Club.The movie has a great theme. Do not end up being a spacemonkey! ""You do the little job you're trained to do. Pull a lever. Push a button. You don't understand any of it, and then you just die."" That theme is backed with great acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two great actors. And even Meatloaf Aday!Buy it now!!"
5,All Generation X Men Must See This,"I originally did not want to see this movie because of the title. I thought it was just another violent, pointless movie. Not the case. Although, as many, I did not see this in the theatre's I bought the DVD out of encouragement from a friend and interest in the movie. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time.This movie is outstanding and makes powerful statements about society, and especially men today. If you are a generation x man you must see this.This movie is very well acted by Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt, and very well directed. I have not yet read the book, but plan to.The picture quality is great on this anamorphic DVD, and the sound editing is great (nominated for an academy award in this category.)"
1,Had to FIGHT not to eject the tape in the first ten minutes!,"FIGHT CLUB was the worst movie I saw so far this year (2000). It was nothing that I expected. There was very little true action and even less ""fighting.""This PULP FICTION wanna be sure didn't do it for me!"
1,I HATE that I have to give this movie a star...,"This is the WORST piece of garbage I have ever seen! If you liked this movie, you are obviously not a very intelligent person. This movie insulted any level of intelligence. I wouldn't pay good money to see this movie again on a bet. Go ahead and waste your money if you want. I'll say I told you so..."
1,terrible cover,"I saw fight club three times in theaters and will buy the DVD, but I'm giving it one star to state how much I detest the cover of the DVD case. What was wrong with the cover that was the same as the ads? You know the one I mean with the soap with ""fight club"" on it above and head shots of Pitt (on the left) and Norton (on the right) below? This new cover is horrible. Did they think Pitt's face wasn't visible enough? This was looking to be like one of the best non two disc DVDs ever and now every time I look at it I must gaze on that wretched picture."
1,Bars of soap and people who talk to themselves,"Ed Norton is the bomb ya know, but he is talking to himself in this movie and it makes no sense. Then this whole soap thing, is this a prison movie or is Brad Pitt just wishing he had not cheated on Gwen Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston and thinks that washing his skin with a bar of soap that says fite club on it will wash away his sinning ways? Norton is a great actor he is one of the best around that is for sure. I think that this movie needs help though it is boring and you don't need to be in a club to fight and kik someone's azz in a new york city basement people!!!! Ridiculous premise that does not hold water, or if it does it is like any bladder, soona or lata it give outta!!"
1,I've heard better pseudophilosophy from bums,"Dear people,Do you do things as part of your job that are probably wrong? Do you feel powerless, controled by 'the man'?Well forget about solving your problems, why not just beat other people up who are in similar plights? As a hobby!!When this movie became a cult classic, every old railroad tyrant from the gilded age probably rolled over in there grave and said ""Dang! Why didn't I think of that?""And of course, after the making of this movie, some people even started thier own little imitation fight clubs. Talk about dumbing us down.And it was supposedly disturbing to some people how the tower explosion scene resembled 9-11. Well of course. That's the real outcome of a sadist fantasy."
2,"Fakey, but still really cool","So, my basic thing is that this movie left you hanging in all kinds of ways...how did the fight club organize itself. How were policies and rules determined, did everyone just listen to brad pitt whenever he talked? That seems a bit unrealistic, was there a treasurer, how did they pay for club events, or advertise?In all fairness, however, obviously this is about more then just the club, and the fighting was really cool."
3,Misunderstood psycho?,"Fight Club is just one of the film's you have to see to believe. I pretty much saw the twist the whole way through but Edward Norton and Brad Pitt keep this movie from sinking into a pool of blood. The premise of the film is pretty simple, no one talks about Fight club etc. This film just seems too out there and never fully exciting. The violence is somewhat brutual but hey Pitt's body is nice to look at. Good movie but not a masterpiece."
5,Fight Club is not just a movie!,"David Fincher is a master. After ""Seven"", I didn't think it would be possible for him to create better, but he certainly has done just that! You find yourself dwelling on this movie long after the credits have disappeared. Discussions with friends appear never-ending. A definite must-own! Don't allow the violence to steer you clear. Take the leap! You won't regret it. Just keep reminding yourself how great ""Seven"" was. That should do the trick!"
3,Missing Book,This Special edition DVD was supposed to have a special sleeve for a book with some art from the movie. The sleeve was there but it was empty...
2,where do I begin,"This is one of those movies that has all the hallmarks of being a classic, but fails on every level. Although stunning in a few sequences, the direction is flawed. Long periods of pointless film making split scenes of pure genius. Unfortunately these scenes span ten minutes of film max. And then there's the story. As I see it a story is good if it can be real. This fim could have been but then we discovered that brad pitt is an imaginary character. At this point the whole fim collapses due to the large nuber of holes that have formed in its structure. Lastly, the story is a pointless one. There is absoultely no reason why this plot needs to be told. I can't think of one. maybe you can. You must see this movie. It shows how a great idea can be ruined by bad direction, disgraceful acting and a moment of pure stupidy in story telling"
3,Great collector's item,"A few things i would like to note,the High Def. for Fight Club was slightly a let down. I have a DLP samsung, and since many scenes were in the dark, the HD did not seem to shine. A few scenes looked great when compared to the DVD version which i have. Might look batter with LCD, i'm not sure.I do like the cover and the ""title menu sequence"" (you'll know what i mean when you buy it). Great addition to any avid movie collector, just don't expect to have great HD content unless you own the high end LED or DimLight technology TVs.If you don't have the movie yet pick it up, definitely a great addition to blu-ray."
5,"excellent evocation of a distant, difficult time","Gene Smith's treatment of the l868 impeachment and trial against President Andrew Johnson is beautifully written and presents fair, yet compelling portraits of all of the major players. In the wake of the most recent impeachment crisis concerning President Clinton, this book becomes more important than ever."
5,Riveting read. Best book on this president and his era.,"After devoring author Gene Smith's page-turning account of the tempestuous Booth dynasty, American Gothic, I was anxious to read his other books. High Crimes and Misdemeanors surpassed my already high expectations. Smith is a true master at bringing to life remote historical characters and selecting that telling detail that will etch his subject into your mind forever. Having also read the more recent Impeached that touches on the same subject matter, I strongly recommend you begin with this version, which I consider a superior and more stimulating read."
3,Ok but not great,For the money these werent a 'bad' deal but I noticed I had much higher percentage of failuries when burning with these discs than with the brand I normally purchase. I really like the white label on these though and for some things I don't mind losing a few more dvd's since the white label allows for much clearer writing on the disc.
4,fairly good introduction to tea ceremony,"This bood is a fairly good intro to the Japanese tea ceremony for the absolute neophyte. Covering history, gardening and a very basic overview of the utensils and ceremony. For anyone wishing to know more about the actual procedures of the ceremony, the book falls short (however, I'm not aware of any books widely available that do a good job of explaining these procedures). As tea ceremony is best learned under the tutalage of an instructor, anyone more serious about tea would do best to seek out a teacher."
2,Low volume ...,"Only last a few sprays, but real effective stuff. Just felt like it went to fast to be a bargain. I do not recommend as a good buy"
5,Nothing is more effective,The Orkin guy gave me a bottle of this last year and it has been amazing! I've used it a couple of times in the house on those sneaky buggers that get in and on a paper wasp nest outside. Worked beautifully. The spray is actually a stream that shoots at least 20 feet (and straight as an arrow). The wasps fall to the ground dead (or will be dead in seconds). Good stuff and worth every penny!
4,"Effective, but expensive",This is the only spray we've found to kill carpenter bees. The only drawback is that it takes one can to kill approximately five bees because you have to soak them individually.
2,my experience,"I received the bottle of spray promptly from the seller, which was great. I had wasps living in the shutters on my house. One flew out and I litterly unloaded 1/4 of the can right into his face. He/she (it was hard to tell) immediately dropped to the ground. But then to my surprise got back up and flew away up into a tree. I was mystified. This was repeated several times with the same result. To the sprays credit, the wasps eventually never came back, but did it kill them, no."
5,"Heads up, will kill more than one wasp","Works great, just ordered second can. Went shock and awe on a single wasp to send a message to the others and used whole can. Other wasps are preparing for the inevitable. The only thing prolonging their lives now is the US postal service."
4,works as expected,Simple to install. Includes instructions and the tools you need. It also include a new filter which I didn't expect.BTW: The instructions warn you that the bulb has mercury in it and you need to dispose of it properly.
3,Before there was court TV,"A Televised drama of the trial of Jean Harris. The infamous headmistress of an exclusive girls school who shot and killed her lover Dr. Herman Tarnower. The victim was the author of a best-selling diet book, which brought the case even more notoriety.This video confines itself exclusively with the trial. No background on the case is given and only slight introductions to the lawyers and the judge as the drama opens. Confusing to people who are not familiar with the case and repetitive to those who are.There are no special features on the DVDFrom the video:""Based on a transcript of the trial of jean Harris. Some of the testimony presented here is not in the same order as given during the trial.Because the proceedings took more than three months to complete, much of the testimony and lawyers' statements, arguments, and objections as well as rulings and charges of the judge in this case have necessity been abbreviated or omitted."""
3,Please bring it back.,"Although I do not consider this to be one of the greatest all time movies, I still love it! It brings back to life those amazing feelings of first love and total infatuation. Plus, Rex Smith was such a hottie, you couldn't help but to cheer Jessie on when she decided to lie to him about her age. I must own this movie! Please help!!!"
4,A warm fuzzy love story,"Please bring it back, I've been wanting to buy this since video was invented!"
4,Rex Smith was suberb in his role as Michael Skye.,"I enjoyed Rex Smith's performance as Michael Skye. I was especially impressed that he had sang all the songs in the video. Jessie's role (played by some actress) was not as strong as it could have been. I found her acting rather weak and irritating. Some parts were added to the movie which weren't present in the original novel. The book is a must read, however, if you enjoy sweet, first romances. READ On!"
5,Great teen and pre-teen movie!,I saw Sooner Or Later when I was around the same age as the girl in the movie. I remember going out and buying the soundtrack and listening to it and dreaming of Rex Smith. I've also been looking for the video. If the company only knew how many people actually would love to buy it maybe they'd re-release it. I saw on an auction on the enternet where someone bid 70.00 for the video. WE WANT SOONER OR LATER! thanks
4,The best first love movie I've seen..,I hope that this movie is re-released..I think all young girls should see a movie like this. I am desperately searching for a copy. I want my daughters to see this movie. I fell in love with it so many years ago. It still remains one of my favorite all time love stories..If anyone knows how I can get a copy please email me...
4,"""First Love!""","This movie has been on my mind since i first saw it! This must be re-released! There is no where to get a copy! Please, bring back the 'first love' in all of us, and for all of us. Thank you!"
3,PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS!!!!,I loved this movie as a teenager. I'd like to see it again. PLease re-release this!
5,You Take My Breath Away!,"Man, I didn't know that there were so many other people out there looking for this film. I have an Album no turntable. Last year for my Husband's Birthday I took him to a Dinner Dance(Valentine Type Thing) And they played ""You Take My Breath Away, We were slow dancing and I was crying. Saw the Movie when I was a kid. Taped it off of TV a while ago. Want it rereleased though. It isn't the same with all the commercials. I have followed Mr. Rex Smith's Career as best as I can. P.S. my husband plays guitar and sings,+ he had long hair when we met. That Movie Rules!!!"
5,"PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS VIDEO, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT !!!","Please re-release, this is very very important. I will pay any price to own this video."
5,jesse and michael,"jesse 13 and michael 17, involved, michael thinks that she is older, i loved this movie, and the book, just a little fyi you can read the sequels in Waiting Games and Now or Never, by Bruce and Carol Hart, i loved the music, everything about it, i taped it off tv because i couldn't find it anywhere, the video has worn from all the play i loved the book when i read it first i was 11, so when i found out there was a movie, i had to see it. reminds me of my first love michael, which is what its supposed to do, i also wrote a letter to bruce and Carol Hart letting them know how much i liked the movie, he wrote back, which was so cool!"
3,"Interesting, a classic heavy band treading unfamiliar water.","The Gemini Suite was a project written by Purple keyboardist Jon Lord in an attempt to meld classical music with rock n' rock and at the same time allow each member a ""solo"" type section in which to show off their skills. It is successfull for the most part, with the legendary Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice really shining in the solo areas. It may not interest people who only own ""Machine Head"" & ""In Rock"", but it is a great addition to any avid Purple fans collection."
3,good orchestra hard rock band,"DP played with Orchetsra at the royal festival hall London 70,..the idea of Jon Lord, conducted once again by Malcolm arnold,.. Nice booklet with a nice cd,..three point for this album cd."
3,This is the LIVE version,"Gemini Suite is (was) a fantastic disk. (Wore out three vinyls!) This particular version is live, and not tight."
3,Bring back the voice!,"Why is Michael whispering on recent recordings? On this one, and the Israel Philharmonic effort, the voice is unfocused and breathy. Please, Mr F., give an ardent fan another gem like Such Sweet Sorrow.Bill HigginsMARGARET RIVER, West Australia"
3,Not up to their usual standards - it drags.......,"As a huge long time fan of both Shearing and Feinstein and collecting both, I was disappointed in this pairing. Mostly it's Feinstein too soft, too slow and no changes in vocal coloring - everything sounds the same - lacking any energy. If you want a CD totally mellow and perhaps sleep inducing, this is the one for you. I expect more from Feinstein. Shearing is perfect, as always! Frankly, Feinstein has lost out in my collection to Michael Ball who really can sing anything perfectly!"
4,For the romantics!,"This is truly 'easy listening' music, and the combination of Michael and George is indeed pleasing to the ear.If you are an incurable romantic, then this CD is for you!"
2,Isn't it Romantic?,"I loved the CD ""Isn't it Romantic"", so much so, that after a good many years, I still play it and love listening, but for some reason, it seems to me Michael has never reached that level with any of the other records he has recorded. I wonder why that is?Michael, you had the secret, wonderful orchestrations would be one of them, why can't you do it again?"
3,ok I guess,I have Been reading Mandie Books for like ever and for awihle that was all I ever read. I got this Book about a month ago and I have to say I was really disipointed! Nothing really happend.The Mysterys in this book were solved so quickly that the book didnt seem very exciting. Dont get me wrong I love Mandie books and I have read the ones I own like a million time but this one I only read twice because it was so unlike the others. [...]From Victoria Byrne age 12
3,Could be better...,"Well, I've been reading Mandie books for a very, very long time now, and this book a pretty much a dissapointment. I mean, on a scale of one to five it's a three, which isn't that bad, but if you compare it to the other Mandie books, it falls apart completely. Mandie is supposed to be sixteen in this book, but acts like she's only eleven. But anyway, the whole gist of the book is that Celia's college application goes missing, followed by Mandie's graduation dress. Big whoop! Not. I was expecting more of a mystery, but this turned out to be just a normal story. Hopefully the new Mandie series will be better when it comes to suspense and Mandie's maturity. Also, I hope they'll be more romantic (I'm a Mandie/Joe fan myself). But anyway, you shouldn't skip this book just cause it sucks or anything. You need to read it to understand the situations in the upcoming series."
2,"Granduation ""Mystery"" ?","This book was a huge disappointment! It was soo slow I thought I was going to die! The book is supposed to be a mystery! The only mystery was who stole Mandie's dress. Any one who is familiar with the Mandie books at all could have guessed that! I'm personally sick of April Snow. And I wish snowball would quit running away it gets rather dull after a while. It was absolutely ridiculous when Mandie wouldn't even think about going to the college Celia wanted to go to! If you have to read this book go ahead, but if you ask me it might not be worth your time."
3,somewhat disapointed,"I started reading the mandie books when I was nine and have been reading all of them as they come out since. I really love the series but I must say as a thirteen year old, fifteen year old mandie acts younger than she did in the first book. When will she grow up???!!!! I still recomend this series to every girl, and I hope that the new series Mrs.Leppard is coming out with will be better in the whole maturity area."
5,mandie book # 40,I recieved this book in great condition and earlier then I expected. I am very happy to complete my set of this series. Thank you.
2,I'm disappointed...,"Well, for one, the whole mystery is well... lacking. Not exactly what I was expecting. The only real mystery is a stolen dress... Oh my, so exciting, um not! I guess Ms. Leppard was so involved in getting her next series going that she just kinda scribbled something down to end THIS series. I have to say I wish she had put some more effort into this book! It does not have the flow all the other Mandie books have. Only read this book to finish the series... Otherwise, spare yourself!"
4,Good Foundation,"Having been through the Grammar several times. I thought I had covered everything...a couple of months later I re-revised it and found more to this handy grammar than meets the eye. It covers the major concepts cearly, although the exercises were somewhat long, and did not treat all the forms mentioned in the particular area. An excellent companion is Gesenius's Companion which provides background and more information. In this respect I still use the Grammar - the tables are excellent, although I would have preferred the parts that are given '&c.' (etc.) to be completed, for confirmation. I would have liked the answers to the exercises to confirm my translations. All in all a great book, although the logic of chapters tends to be disjointed - The regular verb is treated earlier but Numerals are lumped at the end..."
4,A Fine Introductory Grammar (for use with an instructor),"Solid pedagogy. The exercises helped make approaching the Hebrew text less intimidating. The descriptions, though, take work to understand and could be more clear. Also, some language is dated. I feel that it would be difficult to use this text to learn the language on one's own."
3,Picture is not what you get,"Be aware -- the photo shown of this beam is not correct. I ordered it and received a beam that is much wider and flat on the ground. It does not have legs like it shows in the picture. The beam I received is well made, but it looks like the other folding beams from this company."
1,does not do what it claims it can.,"this sale, the disc and cable are of no use to me. I tried installing drivers etc. and Nothing , ""NOTHING"" worked. it's easy $ for someone and now I remember why I don't shop here often."
1,STAY CLEAR OF THIS ONE,"wasted money, shoulda gone thru verizon to buy the real program and cable. no help from the manufacturer, mobile action co. you get what you pay for."
1,Same problem,"I, too, have had the same problem with this software and consider the cost money wasted."
1,CAUTION!!,This humidifier began sparking and smoking in our babies bedroom after only 9 months of use. We were very lucky to have been in the room when this happened. We have contacted the manufacturer and retailer (both have agreed to allow us to return it).
1,Quite a disappointment,"Weld broke on filler cap the first time I opened it. Upon further inspection, I noticed significant flex in the top of the can when the discharge valve handle was pulled. For nearly $80, I expected a can that would last a lifetime of normal use; this can is poorly made and substandard in all respects.Note: Amazon resolved this problem promptly."
1,Unsafe to use - Many better options out there!,"Last year I purchased two of these cans to use in my motorcycle dealership. Within a year, both cans developed leaks where the nozzle connects to the top of the can, and there does not appear to be a way to fix the leak. The leaks have gotten so bad, that when you go to fill up a motorcycle, the fuel pours out of the cans in a steady stream. I emailed the company with pictures asking for advice on what to do about the leaking cans, but they ignored my request and never responded. Unless you like spending time in the burn unit, I would avoid both this model of fuel can and this manufacturer."
3,dented,"ordered 2 cans, one was dented on top, can still use. Second one was dented on top and badly dented on bottom. Bottomlooks like seam weld split. Why cant these guys package and ship properly ? Anyway, product is good.but I think the JUSTRITE type 2 can has an easier handle to use. This can can work but you do need a stronger grip.JUSTRITE can lever is easier to pull when dispensing.Would be 4 stars but seller needs to get some quality control on shipping.I could not return but amazon is shipping me a new can. Love amazon, they are the best. I buy a ton from them butthey know customer service, why go anywhere else ?"
5,Eagle U2-51-S Red Galvanized Steel Type II Gas Safety Can,"This gas can is great. It's my second Eagle U2-51-S. The first I use for my lawn equipment gas-ups. With the first gas can I was really impressed with the lack of gas odor in my garage, and even in the car when transporting the gas from the station to home (not at all like those plastic cans). This gas can sits in my patio with the generator it'll run. And again there is absolutely no gasoline smell in my patio, vinyl windows open or closed...doesn't matter. Definitely recommend!"
4,Good Safety Can,When I received the can there were a few very minor blemishes (mainly small dents near the top) as noted in some of the other reviews. Nothing major and certainly nothing enough to consider sending it back. The can is a little lighter weight than I was expecting and the handle mechanism to dispense the gas is a little clumsy to use in my opinion. Once you've done it a few times it becomes easier to manage. It is nice to be able to get the can into position before starting the flow of gasoline. I know a $10.00 can from the hardware store will hold and dispense gas but I do feel better having this in my garage versus a plastic can.
3,Eagle U2-51-S Type II Gas Safety Can 5-Gallon Metal Red With Flex Spout,"I purchased this gas container and hoped to use it for gasoline storage. Unfortunately, it came in with multiple serious dents on the container because of the poor packaging from the company. I don't know how much damage was on it so I returned to Amazon without using it. It's a heavy duty metal container and very practical for gasoline. I hope the manufacture changes their packaging to have better protection for shipping."
5,Safety Gas Can,"This is a great gas can. Very sturdy and great quality, pefect size. I use it for tailgating as an extended tank for my Honda generator."
4,Good price for this gas can,"I purchased this item from Denny And Kathy's Superstore, which had a price that was a few dollars lower than Ace Hardware. When the can arrived it was in new condition, except for a small one inch dent near the top. I suspect that another reviewer described the same dent on two cans that he ordered. I would not return it for the small dent, but if this seller ordered a shipment that was factory seconds due to the small dents in a production run, I believe they should mention it in their listing. I would recommend this item at this price point."
1,Dented and used Eagle gas can,"The can was dented, and the nozzle look used. Poor quality and packaging! Will try to return, or cancel credit card payment. Amazon says they do not offer returns on this product. Beware!"
3,"Eagle U2-51-S Red Galvanized Steel Type II Gas Safety Can with 7/8"" Flex Spout, 5 gallon Capacity, 13.5"" Height, 12.5"" Diameter",It's a gas can so what can one say. It does the job. However I think a lot more thought could have gone into the filler opening as it's a little clumsy.
1,Poor ergonomics,"Since I purchased this gas can from Amazon, I was unable to try it out beforehand. Had I been able to do so, I would have taken a pass.I am totally baffled as to how Eagle could manufacture a gas can with such poor ergonomics.First, the pull handle is placed so close to the lift handle that, if you have normal sized hands, you cannot readily squeeze the pull handle more than a small distance while gripping the lift handle.Second, the rear loop of the pull handle extends so far back that it contacts the fill spout preventing the pour spout plunger from opening more than a fraction of its full travel. As a result, the pour rate is very low.Third, and the worst, the lift tab on the fill spout gouges your wrist as you try to squeeze the pull handle.No, let me take that back. The worst is that this gas can is not returnable.If you are considering buying this can from Amazon, be sure to check one out at a store to see if your hands are the right size."
4,"Solid can, accurate pours without spills after learning how to use","Wow what a difference from the cheaper plastic cans with spouts that really do not work. This can feels extremely durable. Handle for initiating pour fits four fingers so it is easily pulled. Have to be careful not to open the rear latch too much if you have overfilled the can...gas can spill out from there for a couple seconds. Only takes once to realize this for you to learn. After this operator error, can worked flawlessly. Very happy with purchase.Note after 2 years: I still spill gas with this design, even at 3/4 full can. I was filling up snowmobile with my mittens on yesterday and out comes gas, soaking the thumb of my mitten. Frustrating and this after I have had plenty of experience with can. I have found their slightly cheaper version works better for me. The cheaper version comes with a big yellow spout."
1,Dented - poor shipping.,"This is an expensive gas can, and it is non-returnable. So I am not amused that it arrived damaged.The box that this can was shipped in was a single layer of cardboard -- not nearly good enough to protect the can. The box got slightly banged up in shipping, not even enough to really notice when I received it -- but the can has a nice substantial dent in it. Also some of the paint had flaked off the bottom rim, and that part of the box was completely fine.This makes me think that (1) the steel isn't a heavy enough gauge to make the can as tough as I would expect for this price level, and (2) the paint isn't as well bonded to the steel as it should be.So how long will this can last, even if I get one that is *not* damaged in shipping?I'm starting to think that the only way to get the quality I wanted is to go into the past. Buy something from Ebay that was made in America in 1950."
1,U2-51-S gas can,"Highly dissapointed in these cans. Bought 2, Bought for speed, figureing the vent would provide it, Wrong, their twice as slow as the ones without vents. Whole lotta money wasted, as I went back to useing my old unvented cans. I`d like to return them and get my money back!!!"
4,Bottoms up,This is a replacement for a series of plastic containers that seem to fail at an all to regular pace. I love the look and feel of this can and the built in venting feature. This item should last a very long time. The only improvement I would like to see would be a grip on the bottom of the can to assist in control of the pouring of gas when the can in full. Good item.
4,worth the extra money over 5 gallon plastic containers,"Like others, I was looking for additional gas storage after Hurricane Sandy. These type of metal gas containers are approved by NFPA for gas storage and transfer. For those who are not familiar, NFPA sets guidelines for almost all industrial and building codes and regulations regarding fire safety and practices. The container's shape makes them very stable. The release handle opens up the spout and vent at the same time and the flexible spout keeps spills to a minimum. The spring loaded seals keeps the gasoline fresh much longer and reduces fumes when you are transporting gas in your car. They will also automatically close once you let go of the handle which provides an additional level of safety. The gas tanks are made to very high quality standards. For me, the are worth the extra cost."
5,"Good book, good read","I would have to say these are one of those books that keeps you coming back for more everyday (if you're like me who saids a chapter a day). While some of the late chapters can get a bit technical espcially if you're not familiar with the programming languages but like the arthur said, you can skip a chapter if you like which is only 1 chapter.Otherwise, this is a very insightful book."
3,Big Ideas? Perhaps . . .,"I'm sure that Graham thinks that the ideas he discusses in this set of essays are ""big"" in his book. In fact, some of them are insightful and I did enjoy some of them. I very much enjoy reading others thinking about the craft. It is still such a relatively new discipline, that individuals like Graham create thought patterns that shape our future. I would have to put Software State-of-the-Art: Selected Papers ahead of Hackers and Painters, but the latter is certainly more philosophical and reflective than the former. Graham does certainly know how to get ""down and dirty"" if he has to as illustrated in ""A Plan for Spam"" (will someone tell me why more e-mail readers don't implement the Bayesian filter he proposes?). I would give this one three stars."
5,Nerds Take Notice,"Nerds will like the book, even if they feel defensive or irritated by Graham's comments that hit too close to home.Hypersensitive types (pedants, ""experts"") should avoid the book -- Graham will gore your sacred cow, and the fact that such an insolent non-expert has cashed out with many millions will bother you. You'd best read something else.If you are a programmer (who doesn't hack lisp), the book may really make you wonder. You may think that your favorite language is the best -- but do you really have enough experience to back it up?Graham knows the languages you know. He chooses lisp. He and two other programmers built a $49 million company in 3 years. In the same time period, you didn't. In the ""Fantasy Football"" sense, you got whupped.If this intrigues you, check out ""On Lisp"" (avail free online), by the same author, as it illustrates those things that a lisp master can do that you cannot."
2,Cannot finish it,"This book looks like a ""bar rant"" like J. Fuentes said. The book has a very bad format and flow. A couple of good ideas here and there (that is why I give it an extra star); but you have to read through boring material. I was enthused at the starting but soon it went downhill from there. All the ""technology talk"" can be found in wiki (for a non-hacker) and a hacker (by experience) should already know this stuff.I had to keep the book down half-way as it seems like a badly written auto-biography! Paul Graham had a successful career but I think he should NOT write. Technologists; please do not waste your time!"
2,Not as interesting as title suggests,"Most of the book is a long-winded lecture about how great Lisp is, and about how that is the language of the cool, smart people.There is very little about painting, it is only briefly mentioned in the beginning.The first chapter is quite good, then it gets more preaching and more dull rapidly.Mr Graham is obviously a smart guy and a capable writer. The fact that he was part of a dot-com start up that actually succeeded seems to have gone to his head though. Somehow the fact that he was in the right place with the right idea at the right time enables him to declare Lisp as the uber language, and everybody who doesn't see that is a dullard?The title suggests a book which is whimisical and fun. This book is a preachy diatribe by a pompous hacker who things he has the proper world-view for everyone."
3,medium sized ideas,"first off let me say that this collection of essays is certainly an entertaining and quite amusing read. i often found myself (as a hacker and LISP programmer) chuckling and nodding in recognition , but... the author is very presumptuous and a bit full of himself. these are not big ideas and they are certainly not 'philosophical' as another reviewer commented. philosophy like computer science is difficult, which these essays certainly aren't. they are in many places opinionated and quite narrow minded. i found his opinions often conservative or at least naive when it came to both painting and politics. if you want a light read pick it up, if you're looking for big ideas go for SICP or Nietzsche or something. p.s. you can read many of his essays on line at his website."
3,Opinionated,"This is a mixed bag, I grew up in a different culture, so I found the chapter ""Why Nerds Are unpopular"" very eye-opening, however, the following chapter ""What You Can't Say"" is very ambiguous, Paul seems to find a good reason to be ""heretic"" in mind, but do not tell what he thinks."
2,Interesting But The Book Title Is Misleading!,"The book is a interesting read but the title doesn't represent what the book is about. There is only a small chapter on painting and hacking, the rest is just essays on spam, startups & lisp. The book felt like a random collection of essays & opinions."
3,Interesting but don't believe too much,"I was entertained and greatly appreciated the view of the author but the many times I completely disagreed (due to very substantiated reasons) made me skeptical of several ideas of the author. But, the reasons for him holding those views is, in and of itself, interesting. He does have several good and controversial ideas and his experiences are quite valuable to read. Most of the time, I found myself flying high with him as he stated things that really need to be said which ran against conventional thought. Other times, I found myself raising my eyebrows in bewilderment. After all, it really is a book about his thoughts so take it as such. His book, his soapbox.The book reads well but really trails off towards the end. I found myself finishing the book just so I could say I was through with it. The opening chapters are quite entertaining. Read a few chapters that you find interesting and leave it at that."
5,This is one of my favorite books to recommend to others,"For anyone who wants to understand the geek in their life, or for any geek who's looking for a book filled with ""that's me!"" moments, I cannot recommend this book enough. I've read it three times now and I still love Paul Graham's ability to say many of the things I think better than I ever could."
2,The nerd boy who won,"So Paul Graham is a successful Lisp hacker who made a lot of money from his start-up. Good for him. To be sure, this earns him some credibility in discussing languages and start-ups. Unfortunately, he takes it upon himself to extrapolate from this single data point to universal laws of what makes you successful. Moreover, he seems to think that his success as a geek entrepreneur somehow lends validity to whatever unsubstantiated thoughts, feelings and prejudices he may cook up, including some completely ridiculous views on the general superiority of geeks over regular people. The only reason so many of his readers seem to accept these views must be that he's preaching to the choir: certainly his geek audience would dearly like them to be true. His arcane and naive notions of art and aesthetics are too embarrassing to even discuss. Oh, and the smugness is just insufferable."
4,A good starting point for further research,I found that such book is a good starting point for my dissertation due to the fact that it highlights a diverse range of issues which form the basis for the whole research work to be done.
5,VERY sick gothen-core band,"Well ever since metalcore bands starting using the Gothenburg style there have been some very amazing bands, as well as some of the worst bands in existence. The Red Death, however, is one of the best new hardcore bands to use the gothenburg style. This isnt even really hardcore, everything about this album screams Swedish death metal, all the riffs and the vocals sound straight from Sweden. The Red Death is proof that the metalcore movement really has produced some good bands. If your someone who wants a quality metalcore CD, this would be a good choice, if not you can go buy an Atreyu CD and pretend you know what goos music is. Highly recommended for fans of Darkest Hour or Swedish death metal."
2,Review questions have little similarity to test --,"I used this book along with the companion book which had 360 practice questions ( filled with errors). I studied long and hard with these materials and the actual test differed greatly. I would recommend using these books as a slim refresher only. They are NOT worth the money nor the time in study ( you will be studying VERY general theory). However, most REA subject test booklets are excellent! I dont know why this edition is lacking. If you are about to take the test I would recommend purchasing ""Cracking The Clep"" as a reference of what to study. College Textbooks, internet, Cliff Notes, all of which are better resources than the clep review. Good Luck!"
1,information does not match on the exam,I failed the clep exam of social science and history just using this book. I studied for 5 months before taking the exam. The questions you will see on the exam is totally different to the information of the book. I am a pretty good test taker and i have no education background of social science and history. I think this book just only can be the reference guide. If you want to pass the test choose another book.
4,The Scarlet Letter,"The life of an adulteress living in an unsympathetic Puritan community is displayed in this book. She is punished by being forced to wear a scarlet A on the bodice of her dress; however, she never really sees any wrong in the sin that she has committed. The A throughout the novel comes to have different meanings, due to the author's use of ambiguity. It is a great novel which opens your mind to new ways of receiving things. The novel allows for more than one interpretation on many of it's aspects."
4,Great Design Ideas and Good Photos,"I love this book and use it all the time for clients...it has lots of plant ideas and color photos...also, it gives concise information regarding the plants requirements, i.e., sun, water, etc...I highly recommend this book even if you're just sprucing up your current garden or want to make a totally new garden...This book is great for all of southern california and I think is the most comprehensive garden design book I have in my collection...."
1,Biggest Waste of Time and Trees,"Initially, I liked the book b/c in the forward, using tongue & cheek, the author was trying to give tips on how to keep your sanity at work by detaching yourself. Then, I started to read the main body of the book. There go a bunch of hours of my life I will never get back.I had to read this book for a class. I won't even put it up for sale back at Amazon, I'll just donate it to the Library so that if someone needs to read this book, he/she won't have to waste their money like I did."
1,Zen references too overdone,"I very much enjoyed Stanley Bing's other book, ""How To Relax Without Getting The Axe"", but I couldn't get through more than a few chapters in this one. The Zen references get tiring very quickly, and what humor there is gets lost in them."
3,Hilarious but not so useful,"I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2 because it really made me laugh. However, if you have been in corporate American for more than 5 years, you probably already know that ""elephants"" (Sr. Management) are self-centered weirdos, not normal people like you and me. And the best way to get by is to let them be what they are and ensure you simply manage around their craziness. If you are hoping for useful advice, seek elsewhere. For a funny read, enjoy this book."
2,A book about nothing,"It must have been fun to write this book. It is much better than Mr Bing's What Would Machiavelli Do? There is more humor than knowledge in this one. Even if you are a Bing fan, I would suggest you borrow it from the library."
2,Review,"Yes, there is some humor in this book. Yes, it explains the reason why narcissists are the way they are. Yes, it gives you advice in how to deal with narcissists. Was the read enjoyable? I found it frustrating that everything was written as an analogy or a philosophical parallel. I believe it would have been more enjoyable if they started out with a brief analogy/philosophical parallel and then used the authors humor to write the rest of the narrative as a personal anecdote."
3,Life changing material,"Often we accept the status quo that we are born into. We are not prodded to criticize the rules and standards passed on by our fathers and their forefathers. The key word here is FATHERS! This book isn't about being liberal or conservative, its about completeness. History, Education, and gender bias have ignored and continue to marginalize half of our society. I had not realized this before I took this class or read this book. I had the same societially fed distaste for feminism that most people have, but feminists are, in the highest sense, humanists. This book explores with research, (rather than only theorizing) sources of discrimination and oppression for both men and women. This book has been a source of empowerment for both me and many of the women around me. I strongly encourage ANYONE to read it. This book has not only changed my mind, but it has changed my life."
4,Women and Gender,Smooth transaction where the product was in the condition that was described and arrived within the estimated arrival date thus shipping was also as described. Thank you.
4,great first Cussler book,"This was the first Cussler/Pitt book I had ever read and it was the best book I have read at the time. A friend had given it to me and he gave me some other books along with it I read the other ones and then I read this book I was just blown away by how thorough it was in its discriptions, ever since then I read every one of his knew books and everyone of the old ones I could get my hands on. I've read other books from other authers but everyone and everytime I always say to myself (with out knowing it) when is Dirk Pitt going to come onto the sceen but then I remember that its not a Clive Cussler novel."
3,A wild adventure,"The Alexandria Library was first burned in Julius Caesar's time.By 391 AD it had again become important: ( you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket?) wishful thinking would want the documents destroyed in theseevents.The story is a very far fetched one, but if you suspend belief,it is like a fantasy adventure with terrorists and jumping all over the world...Dirk Pitt only beds two women, but one is the secretary general of the UN. Ancient sea wrecks, and very old buried treasure are what Clive Cussler thrives on!"
5,Cussler Thrills Again,"This is one of the best Cussler books out there. It's suspenseful, packed with action, and loaded with plot twists to keep the reader on his or her toes. The second half of the book is loaded with action. The only complaint I have is that the President is generic and easily convinced of anything. He seems to be more of a puppet.Still, I heartily recommend this book."
5,Cussler keeps right on thrilling!,"The Dirk Pitt series is great. Enjoyed it right to the end! Cussler has a way of taking the past, making it a little more interesting by building a tale around a single event. For a book written in 1988, it's amazing how close he came to the way events have unfolded in the past few years (middle-east & Egyptian situations)!"
2,Missing pages.,"Would have been 5-star if all pages were included. 32 pages missing. As always, very entertaining and full of suspense."
5,Very Exciting,This book will keep your eyes riveted to the pages. It is very exciting and full of action. Dirk get into a lot of situations and then escapes as only he can. JMC
5,The book that hooked me to Cussler,"Since the beginning of being able to read I hadn't found a book to satify my historical needs as well as my entertaiment needs! But here we go, a book, packed with history, packed with entertaiment and I read it. A MUST for every Cussler fan, a MUST for every history fiction fan. 100% pure thrill!!!! Keep it up Clive!"
5,A Cracking Good Yarn!,"A ""treasure"" of a read! Treasure is an interesting story with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end! Cussler always brings in an unusual and interesting history hook to start off the story and this one is no exception...the tale begins in the late Roman Empire at the famous Library of Alexandria,(one of the eight wonders of the ancient world)! Oops sorry I can not tell you more, but suffice it to say Cussler is both a good researcher and story teller and you will love it as much as I did...buy it!"
5,StupendouS! I vote this for the second movie!,"Sure, it's a bit of a stretch that one hunk of a man would score dates with two women involved in an international catastrophic acciddent, (It's so romantic that he saw past all the blood on their pretty little faces ;op) but Male Ego aside, this is the best Dirk Pitt book to date. If you want to read gross new methods of murder by crazed anarchists who think of themselves as reencarnated gods and you thrive on intense action, this is a great book! Clive Cussler is great at making old ideas seem like they've never been written before, or at least not well, until now."
1,Ridiculous. Ego and Boredom,"I tried to like this book..But I could never get past the unbelieveable ego of Dirk Pitt. During the plane crash rescue he gets 2 dinner dates with the only two women available. Of course the women were beautiful....but when you have blazing eyes and wonderful hair like Pitt has it's only natural women would swoon(even in a plane crash). That's when I had to check the cover and make sure I wasn't reading Danielle Steel.After all that if you need more egomania check out the back cover where it states the author's life rivals that of the hero D.Pitt. Please give me a break. I will simply have to wait for more books by Matt Rielly,James Rollins, Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston. They all put this egomanic to shame."
5,Great book,"Although this is not the best Cussler novel I have read, it is still very good. I really enjoyed the historical part of it and thought it the plot was pretty clever. I liked how the hid the cruise ship and the ending was pretty cool. But, it could have been better. I dont know how it could've been better. I just know it had great potential but didn't fully fill that potential. Anyway, it's still a great book."
2,The Pitts,"This is not a bad story if you can enjoy an unrealistic protagonist like Dirk Pitt. He's tall, handsome, tough, inexplicably rich, has military rank and civilian standing, and enjoys political clout through his father (Senator Pitt) and friends. Basically, he's Batman without the costume and with more explosive gadgets. The women in the story (a doctor and a diplomat) gush at his patronizing remarks about their good looks and hurl themselves at his feet (and into his bed). The best thing Clive Cussler brings to this story is his experience and knowledge of deep sea operations. The story boasts plenty of action, but it's all a little too unrealistic to hold my attention. I also disagree with the jacket's comment about Clive Cussler being a lot like Dirk Pitt. No real person is like Dirk Pitt."
2,Disappointing,"I was not impressed with this book at all.There are many sections of the novel that are just so boring, I almost felt conpelled to just bail on it. I only finished the novel because I'm a completist. Many of Cussler's interests just do not interest me at all, which leads to large sections of the novel devoted to things I really don't care at all about (i.e. antique cars).Also, I just find all the Dirk Pitt hero worship to be nauseating. There were many parts of the novel where I found myself just rolling my eyes at how the other characters were slobbering over the greatness that is Dirk Pitt.I guess these novels are just not for me. I'm from a generation that idolizes Al Bundy and Homer Simpson, not these ridiculous James bond type characters."
5,Cussler and Pitt at their best!,"Two words, Dirk Pitt. Dirk Pitt is the true action adventure hero. An American James Bond you could say. In Treasure Dirk Pitt goes up against the most feared, and respected, assassin in the world. Also at the same time he is in the middle of a search for the treasures of the Library of Alexandria, and is worrying about his own love affairs. I think this book is a spine tingling thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you like Bond movies, or any other espionage/action flic, you will love this. Make your next book Treasure, by Clive Cussler."
2,Treasure,"I have read about 8-9 Cussler Books and this was one of the worst ones. It drug on an on... The plot started off with potential, but developed into two stories that did not incorporate/mix very well."
5,Just like Karl May,"Of course, Karl May wrote 120 years ago and created the hero Apache Chief Winnetou who was the idol of every joungster in Germany when I grew up; we loved the American Indians for their bravery in their struggle against homicide by the western Christians and their mass murder weapons against the natives of this continent. Clive Cussler brings the old struggle back to life with Dirk Pitt. Great reading."
5,Better then the other Dirk Pitt novels,Treasure by Clive Cussler was much better then the other Dirk Pitt novels I read. However this would probably not be the same opinion of the others who read this book because I liked this book better because it focused on an earlier timeperiod then the other books I read.This story revolves around the US trying to stop radicals from taking power of Egypt (by an Islamic extremist) and Mexico (by someone who wants to bring the Aztecs back in power). Dirk Pitt must stop this while looking for a stash of secret scrolls that were taken from the Library of Alexandria before it was destroyed.I enjoyed the history lesson in this book and couldn't put this book down. I would suggest this Dirk Pitt book to people who enjoy a mix of action and older history.
5,A classic adventure-,"Treasure is a classic, a great book to start the novice Clive Cussler reader. The hero, Dirk Pitt is the quintessental righter of wrongs. He's James Bond, Indiana Jones and MacGyver all rolled into one, with a great sidekick in Al Giordano. The tongue in cheek humor between the two men make them rivel the greatest comedic teams in history. But when the situation calls for it, they're all business. I have all the Dirk Pitt books and this is one of my favorites. You'll love it."
1,tripe,"this is the first cussler book i have read and i just do not understand why he is so popular. the idea was a good one, but the writing and the plotline were just awful. this is the kind of book which makes me want to give up my day job and start writing thrillers myself, because i cannot see how i could produce anything as unconvincing and wooden as this."
3,All right,"TREASURE was the first Clive Cussler novel I had ever fully read. I'd got SHOCK WAVE out of the library but my interest wandered after about five pages because it was so boring. I then read TREASURE. The opening sequence is better than most. Most of them have a boring sequence of a boat sinking, but TREASURE opens with a battle scene which is far better than any other. The next thing to happen is an airline disaster, then a zany car chase down a ski slope (it's the best scene in any Dirk Pitt book of the three that I've read), a shootout at a chalet in the snow, another shootout in a mill, and finally and hand-to-hand fight scene inside the library of Alexandria. As I read the other Clive Cussler books, I realised that the dialogue was terrible for an experienced author (my favourie exerpts are ""His diabolic mind"" and ""a sandy beach"")and there are many, MANY boring scenes with politicians in every single book. Okay."
3,maybe time for a new line up?,"This band may have exhausted all there resources recording the last 2 albums. This line up just can't achieve what they had on the first recording together... While the music is far from bad or bland - it doesn't sound as new and exciting as the first effort ""Alas no axis."" The songs may have had insightful improvements with a new line up or even just replaceing 1 or 2 of the musicians to get a different feel. If you have the first two albums by these guys - you can safely avoid this effort. Again, it's not bad - but it doesn't break any new ground at all..."
5,Viridiana by Luis Buñuel,"Even though Viridiana is very controversial because of its harsh attack against the Catholic Church, the film is very artistic and makes a very good point: ""Don't expect that God will help you if you do nothing to help yourself."""
3,Luis Buñuel's controversial masterpiece,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Viridiana is the story of a woman who tries to maintain morality while avoiding her uncle.The film contains many scenes percieved as offensive by the Vatican who denounced the film. Not being Catholic, I did not understand all the scenes which were considered offensive but I got a general idea as to why the film is so controversial.The film is regarded as one of Buñuel's best films and remains popular to this day.The DVD has an interview with lead actress Sylvia Pinal and author Richard Porton, scened from an episode of ""Cinèastes de notre temps"" noting Buñuel's early career and a US release trailer.This is a must buy for Buñuel fans."
4,The harder edge of Ms. Ford,"While ""The Best of Lita Ford"" focuses on the commercial stuff you heard on the radio and MTV, ""Greatest Hits""(a deceiving title!)is mostly album tracks that not many people except fans heard. ""Blueberry"" is the toughest song from the too-slick 1987 CD ""Lita""(complete with S&M lyrics)and the outtake ""Hellraiser"" is a wild and woolly cover song from The Sweet(and this is the only place you can find it). Booklet photos of Lita in a factory are perplexing, but she was indeed an original. If Lita hadn't come along, someone would have had to invent her. B-"
3,playin'with fire..,"overall,kinda disappointed her better hits not included such as--close my eyes forever--dressed to kill --gotta let go--lisa- and back to the cave --her 1992 best of or her 1988self -titled LITA album, will be the best collection to own--all i can say, i was hungry for more rock!"
5,the oh soooooooooooo easy rack to clean!!!!,A great product. i will be ordering another.Clean up is a breeze. This product should have been made available years ago.Easy clean up in the sink or dishwasher. Just what the cook ordered.Love it!!!!!!
2,"Good idea, but too small","A silicone roasting rack is a great idea and much needed, given that most ""non-stick"" roasting racks are anything but. However, this version is not well executed. It is way too small to have much utility. You can get a single small pork roast on it, but that's about it. You won't be using this for baking poultry pieces, pork chops, etc., and don't even think you could put a turkey on it. Somebody needs to take this idea and make a big version of it. They would sell a million of them."
5,Simply the Finest Roasting Rack,"No need to mince words - the William Bounds Sili Gourmet V-Shaped Roasting Rack is the last roasting rack you will need to buy. This rack appears to be manufactured from first rate materials. As you can surmise from reading all the other reviews of this product, I am not alone in my assessment. For me, this was a no-brainer. I now truly enjoy the roasting process. Why? Let's face it; cleaning a roasting rack is a royal pain. This rack eliminates this time consuming chore and makes cleaning a breeze! Easy clean-up is a good thing. Enjoy."
5,Excellent combination of form and function,"Bought this to replace a lighter stainless rack I've had for thirty years, which finally broke. I love the red color, and the round feet to keep it of the bottom of the pan. It feels sturdy enough to roast an elephant haunch. It certainly has been excellent with the roasts we have roasted on it. Withstands oven temperatures as high as our oven will go, and it goes in the dishwasher. Highly recommended."
4,Well Designed Roasting Rack,"Purchased this rack with our new stainless steel roasting pan on the recommendation of the site. Used it for turkey on Thanksgiving and it worked great. The lower ""V"" shape doesn't pressure the bird while cooking. Easy to remove while hot as the silicon costing stays cool."

2,"Great Book, but has battery problems","My son loves this book. It really is helping us with toilet training. My big complaint is that you cannot replace the battery in the ""flushing"" button. I had to buy another copy because my son was upset when the battery died. I cannot see any way to replace the battery."
4,Good Starter Book,"As you start to introduce your son to potty training this is a good book. It is a board book with colorful pictures that show a young boy using the potty. It has simple wording that is easy to follow. However, I, too, found that after a few pushes of the flush button it stopped working.The book is basic though. So if your son has already started sitting on the potty it may not be as relevant. It doesn't talk about having accidents, that you need to sit and wait sometimes for the potty to come out, or how to know when you need to go. But it does talk about the process of peeing or pooing, wiping, flushing, and washing your hands.It has a cute write on/wipe off success chart in the back of the book. I didn't find that useful, but some parents might."
5,"One of my ""Top 5"".","Every now and again I'm asked to list the 5 best books I've ever read. My list always starts with The Edge of Sadness. O'Connor's story is simple, but beautiful. Most readers will relate to it on some level and will have a better appreciation and understanding of the people in their lives who ""are"" O'Connor's characters. Don't be surprised if this book has a subtle yet profound effect on the way you perceive and interact with the people in your life. You will most likely understand them and their lonely struggles much better. This book will stay on your bookshelf for many years to come and you will undoubtedly return to its pages often."
5,Unsurpassed grace of content and form,"This is a book that brings one back to the time of Priesthood when the clergy had respect of others and genuinely loved and cared for those within their remit. ""The Edge of Sadness"" is a book to read, and re-read, to love and give away, to share and make known to those who have never stopped believing that within every Priest Christ lives and suffers."
3,4 Year Owner,"This printer came with my Gateway four years ago. I always thought it was a lousy printer, but heck, it did its job. My photos never came out very well- they were always hazy and in a 4x6 photo, I couldn't really make out faces. I tried changing to different photo paper, but that just wasn't the problem. Another problem is that the ink is insanely expensive. [...] The ink runs out fast. I didn't do much printing (an English paper here and there), but I'd replace the cartridges at least once every three months. It doesn't sound like that often, but trust me, it'll feel like a lot more. Finally, the printer gave out and won't print anything despite countless attempts to revive it. Although it wasn't my favorite printer in the world, it's held up for me and done its job. I'm kind of sad to see it go. Well, time to move on to another printer! Hopefully, it'll last as long, if not longer. :)"
3,Great printer- expensive ink.,"I bought my Pixma ip 1600 after throwing out yet another Epson that dred up and became useless if not babied and used every day. The reviews looked good, the Pixma was cheap, so I bought it.A year later it still prints perfectly, even if I don't use it for two weeks. But as many others note, there's a catch: This is a very expensive printer to operate. The cheapest deal I've found on cartridges is $50 for two B&Ws; and one color, and that doesn't seem to last very long. Doing graphics or photos empties a cartridge very fast. Maybe the next generation will be better."
2,Prints as fast as it goes through ink,"This is a speedy little printer. I could prints sheets of wallet size photos in minutes verses hours with old HP. This printer is so new to the market that ink refills are only available online (9/05). This is bad because this printer also eats ink. The color cartridge lasted about 128 (2x3) photos (30 pages of 8 photos each) In 3 weeks, I've used 4 cartridges at $20@. Best to look at the more efficient Canon printers."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this printer because I wanted high quality photo printing and I didn't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers. It's a Canon, so I figured I could count on the photo quality. I was terribly disappointed though. I generally buy Staples brand photo paper for general photo printing, and it always worked fine with my Epson printer. But my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy -- like I was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey/brown haze. So I went out and bought Canon paper instead. The quality was somewhat improved, but still not what I had expected. So yes, I got a printer for under $30, but now to get even passably OK prints, I need to spend a fortune on Canon brand inks and paper. Not much of a bargain."
3,"Great printer, but mine jammed and broke in 2 mos.","Awesome printer, awesome price. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't jam and become unusable. If no one else had this problem, then maybe it's random and normal. The thing is, this printer was so cheap, it doesn't bother me too much. Oh, and it works great with Mac."
1,Unusable,"I received this printer yesterday. After installing the drivers I started getting boot errors under windows XP home SP2. I went to Canon's website and got the latest drivers, same problem.I also installed the included applications. When I tried to run them, the application would crash immediately. If I tried to run it again the computer would reboot!In the end I had to restore from a backup. Fortunately I took last weekend.Needless to say, I would not recommend this printer. It may be inexpensive, but it's not worth the hassle of restoring from backup or having to completely reinstall your OS."
1,Dishonest Seller,"Purchased this used Canon PIXMA iP1600 Photo Printer which advertized as ""like new, works smoothly,..."". In actuality, it was a beat-up and non-functioning piece of junk. Contacted the seller immediately by email. The seller claimed to be a student and promised to refund the amount by installment and would arranged for return shipment. However, never heard from him again, even after months. I don't mind paying $34 for a piece of junk but being cheated is another story."
1,Absolute GARBAGE! DO not waist your money......,"This printer prints once or twice and then jams every time. It does not even have a drop tray, but the drop tray did not bother me. It is just a terrible printer. Dont waste your money....."
1,WHY BUY THIS???!!!!,"Why would you spend 50 bucks on a printer who's cartridges together are going to cost as much as the printer?? Not only are they expensive, but the color cartridges are all in one cartidges. What this means is that you run out of one color and you have to pay 25 dollars to replace the whole cartridge! When you get a flat tire you don't replace all four tires do you?! That would be rediculous and expensive. That is the same idea with this printer, it is a much better buy to pay an extra 50 or 60 bucks, the amount you would pay for two ink cartridges and go to the IP4200. I do not recommend this printer, instead go with the IP4200 you will be saving money in the long run. The color cartidges are seperate in the IP4200 so you are not paying 25 dollars every time you buy an ink cartridge. I don't recommend this printer. Save your money in the long run and buy a different one."
3,Expensive Printer in Long run,After Printing 45 colored 4x6 and 3-4 large size Photos the color cartridge ran out of colour. The cost of the color cartridge is $25.00 So I got my photo $25/50 0r .50 cents per print. In the long run this printer is very expensive. I had i560 and used to print at least +100 Photos. Print quality was also good. If you need only B/W text print then printing cost will be far less.Print quality is good if you setup the printer at best quality and use Canon Photo Paper. I also used Kodak Paper the print was very bad.REC: Research and Buy some other printer that will be inexpensive in long run.
4,good value,"pros:-prints fast-not noisy-affordable price for a student like mecons:-a littele bit big-(i've heard it eats ink so fast, but i usued only several times, so i can't tell at this moment)"
1,expected less-got more,"I was looking for a portable, no bells & whistles printer. This is just what I got. BUT..the printing is as good as Epson printers that I have. I do not intend to print color pictures although it is capable of doing so. The black & white copy is great, good for downloading internet info. This is a great deal for the price."
3,Great printer but there's a catch...,"So this printer is pretty awesome. Reviews are favorable, it's small, pretty quiet, print quality and speed are great and it ridiculously cheap... the catch is the cartridges. They're very expensive and recycled carts are very hard to come by. I could get recycled carts for my old Epson (I forget the model but it was _very_ popular) for like 8 bucks for black and 10 for color or something like that. Carts for the IP1600 are about $25 for black and $30 for color for Canon brand and $17-20 for third party. 2 cartridges cost more than the printer itself. In the long run it ends up being NO bargain.I'm very pleased with the printer and its performance, just not with the cost of ownership."
2,Will not print on coated labels and paper.,"I use to only buy Canon products but this is the second Canon product in a row to fail on me (the other being a fax.)First the low ink warning does not work. After replacing the cartridges several times, I still get the warning.Second, the machine printed beutifully on my coated labels and paper but the ink comes off when touched. I used only Canon ink cartridges and have tested every new cartridge with coated paper and still the ink comes off.The machine does print fine on uncoated stock and besides the warning light, I have not had any other problems."
5,Good Schtuff,"I am a tea drinker. I love green tea. I used the twinnings green tea for a while. They use full leaves and they make a bit of a lighter tea. I do like that. This tea is cut up into smaller pieces, and is a darker nuttier brew. I wasn't sure if I'd like that at first, but I have grown to really like it. I often mix it with a little chamomile or ""Davidson's Tea Bulk, Organic Spring Fruit & Flowers"" which is great.Davidson's Tea Bulk, Organic Spring Fruit & Flowers, 16-Ounce Bag]]"
2,Incredibly disappointed,"I bought this tea hoping for something that would be more cost effective than buying teabags. It was delicious for the first 4 days or so, and I kept it in an airtight container. On around the 5th day, however, I brewed a cup and it was horribly bitter. I tried a different teaball with the same result, a french press still to no avail, and lastly I tried using a thick paper towel as a makeshift tea bag. It all just tasted horrible. I was really disappointed with this product, and I won't be buying from this company again. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for the good first 4 days I had with it."
3,Oldie but Alrighty,"This album may not have that great of songs, but I've had it since it came out way back in 1993. It is great for nostalgic purposes and brings back many memories. It is for long time wrestling fans. What's great about it is that I have it signed by Tatanka when I met him way back then."
3,ughhh...,"One need only watch one episode and then has seen them all. Predictable, annoying characters. If I wish to be annoyed, I have other options...Hyacinth is someone that noone would want to know, and her husband is faint hearted wimp. I would never order another season...all episodes have the same framework. Hyacinth wishes to impress someone of social staure, and her family embarasses her...over and over again..."
1,Download Disappointment,"I ordered the book and thought I would download this ""Probe."" This is nothing but a commercial for the book. Save your money and wait on the book. I hope it is better than the ""probe."" This ""Probe"" does not live up to Amazon's stellar reputation and I know what I am talking about. I am a very pleased customer of Amazon having purchased hundreds of dollars with them.Ron Englishhttp://www.fowlerinc.com"
5,Sports Nut,"This collection is fantastic. If you love sports you'll love these tapes. Great shots, interviews, classic footage. I'd recommend it for anyone - it's a great price, too!"
2,Not His Best Album,I think that songs 1 and 3 the only ones that are good. The lack for more stars is partially for his material but mostly on this album he sounds like he is singing out of his nose. He made a major improvements in his voice on his later albums
4,Electric Hellfire Club - 'Unholy Roller' (Cleopatra),"Haven't actually sat down to listen to any CD by this 'industrial metal' band in awhile. Good ten track compilation of remixes of the Electric Hellfire Club's past releases. Tunes that definitely stand on their own are the head-riveting ""Prince Of Darkness (Black Version)"", ""The Root Of All Evil"", their homage to Motley Crue with ""Shout At The Devil"" and the *ss-kicking ""Book Of Lies (Ether-eal Mix)"". Should do something (maybe a lot) for fans of Ministry, Monster Magnet, White Zombie and maybe Coal Chamber {?}. Check it out."
4,They've done it again,"I only gave this 4 star because I was disappointed that it wasn't a new album when I got it. That aside, this is a great disc. Like I've said before, EHC puts out great remixes that don't just rehash the same sound. The blatant commercialism (which they speak of themselves) of Shout at the Devil is great. Cykophuk's Hellfire mix is great, as are the rest of the mixes. Unholy Roller is a good new piece as well."
4,Confusion in the Game,"Thank you for responding back. I've been looking for a Player's Guide in this game because it gets confusing for awhile. So, I don't mind cheating, which is my best bet in most games. I found what I've been looking for."
1,Targus PA088UZ does NOT support Vista,"I bought the PA088UZ to use on Vista laptop. It arrived with Spec Sheet clearly stating it is supported on Vista. Vista does not load drivers. Targus Customer Support says Vista is not supported and offers no solution. It does now appear that Vista has been removed from the Targus product web advertisement.Net: there are alternative non-Targus products that provide this support for Vista, but not this one."
1,Internally Inconsistant,"I did not finish this book. Some paragraphs, such as about the radar equipment on the Bismarck, I read a couple of times before realizing that the problem was not my understanding, but contradictory statements in the writing."
2,"Flawed, but interesting","The authors' description of the politics and psychology of the British Admiralty is probably the most interesting part of this volume; the number of little technical errors in ship descriptions, however, should have been caught in proofreading, and detract from the quality of the presentation."
4,"Last song ""Beyond & Before"" Rocks! Has other good tunes too.","Thank Goodness (or Thank ""Sweetness"") there are two CDs. The first one has some good songs but for me, it seemed lacking. Yeah ""Every Little Thing"" is interesting and ""Looking Around,"" ""Sweetness,"" etc. are good songs. Still, there seemed to be something missing. On CD2, I knew why I felt unsatisfied!The version of ""Everydays"" on CD2 is longer and more of a rocking tune. Speaking of better versions, the version of ""Sweetness"" is far superior to the previous version discussed. Listen to the different ending on this one! If there was any doubt over which CD is the better, listen to ""Beyond & Before""- that is one of the group's best tunes! Wonderful!(*note -I rated this 4 Stars instead of 5 because about half of the songs throughout are listenable but not very exciting, compared to the better moments that are primarily on CD2)"
3,Uneven but occasionally very good,"The first 5 selections on disc 1 of this 2-CD set showcase a very impressive band doing straight-ahead salsa/latin jazz. Guest musicians include legends like Andy Gonzalez (bass), Papo Vazquez(trombone), Charlie Sepulveda (trumpet), Ray Vega (trumpet) and Alex Acuna (drums). The fare becomes much lighter from there--more like latin pop than salsa. The second disc continues this trend, although the percussion showcase ""D.B. Goes to New York"" is quite good (despite the ridiculous and unnecessary introduction). This group shows great promise. The musicianship is first rate, but the choice of tunes seems focused on a misguided attempt at cross-over pop success."
2,Historically Inaccurate,"This book may be the rip-roaring yarn it is reported to be. I do not know. I was so appalled at the vast historical inaccuracies that I could not make it past the first chapter. Henry Morgan was a fairly interesting historical character and a great deal has been written about him, including first hand accounts. This author seems to have read little on West Indies' history and simply appropriated the name of Morgan for his title character and written a pirate adventure story. I would strongly suggest not reading this book if you are interested in the real Henry Morgan or buccaneer history."
2,Not as good as Frommer's Day-by-day,"I couldn't decide between this book and Frommer's Seattle Day by Day guide for our recent trip to Seattle. I ended up buying both, but found the other one to be more useful.I actually kept the Frommer's guide with me at all times, and I ended up barely using this one.This Eyewitness guide did seem to have better restaurant recommendations that were more realistic/affordable/normal types of places. In general, though, I found the maps and layout of the Frommer's guide to be much more useful.I think this book does the job, but if I had to pick just one, I'd definitely recommend the Frommer's instead."
3,So So Seattle,"Seattle is a great cosmopolitan city. The books in this series are usually excellent. This one is sub par, it doesn't do the city justice. It's o.k. if you want info concentrated on one city, but you'll gleen as many insights from the Chamber of Commerce visitor information.I was disappointed in the book, not the city."
5,Good little guide book,"I revisited the Seattle area recently in April and this book was very helpful. My sister moved there in January and we used this book to explore. I left it with her because it mentioned places and restaurants that the other guidebooks didn't. We went to one place in the International district and found some great Dim Sum. It was yummy and you could see that a lot of locals go there. It really does hit the top 10 with good maps as well. You may want another more complete guide book, but the maps and recommendations in this one are great."
3,Wrong information about water taxi location,"Sorry to say I sued this little book and wanted to get to the water taxi from the piers to Aliki Beach, and the location was wrong. this was so confusing for our out of town friends that they taxied instead. We found it, after asking a few different folks, and rode it over and back. This was confusing for all. Hope the other info is accurate!"
5,Top or Bottom?,"Great book...love that they also have bottom ten, something a lot of books unfortunately refuse to do."
4,Good Information in pocket sized guide,"This is my 6th or 7th Eyewitness guide. They do a great job. I have not traveled to Seattle yet, but since my best friend just moved there, I wanted to have a heads up."
4,Nice Selections,"They may not be considered to be a ground breaking or a super band, but they did have some absolute ""must have"" songs for a music collection. American Woman alone justifies the cost of the CD. In ""American Woman"" and ""No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature"" you can see (hear?) the potential of Randy Bachman & his guitar. Bachman later went on to Bachman-Turner Over Drive (BTO). Burton Cummings, who wrote almost all their hits, vocals and style were perfect fits in that era. If they were a US or British band and hadn't tried to deceive the public by usurping the name ""Who,"" I wonder if they would have been given more critical acclaim. (They were a Canadian band.)"
3,Didn't realize it wasn't downloadable,"It's okay for a younger child, but not one that understands how mp3's really work. Difficult with the card. Where are you going to find another card? The idea of mp3's is that you don't have to have an external music outlet. This player doesn't offer that option. It's cute and fun... but that's about it."
3,"Works well, but doesn't replace an MP3 player","I bought this for my 4 year-old daughter for Christmas because she wanted an MP3 player like her older siblings. It is very easy for her to use however, it's hard to find new Mix Clip cards for it - Target only carries one or two and we have them both. Also, the Mix Clip cards are so small that they're very easy to lose. In the end, my daughter is disappointed that she didn't get an MP3 player so that she could listen to exactly what she wants just like the ""big kids."""
4,Pretty darn good,"When I purchased this game I was skeptical. I read the lousy reviews, and I hate buying bad games, but the price was good enough for me to take chance. I had downloaded version 1.07 demo from the battefront web site and really enjoyed. The lates patch is 1.08, and apparently this makes all the difference from the initial release of this game that received such bad reviews. The bottom line is that it is fun, and realistic. I'm an infantryman in the National Guard, and I have 3 years of active duty service in the regular Army. I can say from experience that this is one of the more realistic games I've ever come across. It's not a perfect game though. The user interface is a bit odd and takes some getting used to. The campaign is not very realistic because combat losses in one scenario seem to have no effect on combat strength in the susequent scenarios. For the price, this game is a real gem."
5,GREAT TEACHING METHOD,"I am so happy that I bought this product. I have played hobby bassman for years with electric basses, and always wanted to move up in class. This is the best way to do it."
4,Good beginners intro to Upright bass!,"Dvd is an excellent introduction to upright bass. I have played electric bass for many years, and this dvd provides many answers to questions I had on making a transition from electric bass to an acoustic bass. Very helpful, and easy to follow and understand. Todd Phillips is a good teacher and I recommend his dvd."
4,GREAT CD,"this is some great great great experimental stuff the whole cd is good, ALIEN SEX FIEND is good all around most of there cd's are just as good as this one this is one is by far my favorite though it just appeals to me more."
3,Crank up the cheese,"If you're a fan of power metal, then I'm sure you're ready for the cheese factor. These guys are very enthusiastic, and as long as you're in the mood for crazy guitar solos and sometimes unintelligibly-accented lyrics, then you're in for a treat. They're not breaking any new ground, but this album's a fun listen."
4,So Nice To Find!,"We use these at work to keep notes on projects and keep things organized. But it seems like you can never find them anywhere any more. Made it is just the location I am in, but I used to see these all over the place and now I can't. Fortunately I was able to find them here at Amazon and they carry the Oxford brand which has always meant a quality product to me. You get what you would expect, note cards on a spiral ring that you can tear off when you need to. These are well made and will hopefully serve us well in the future."
4,Amy with a ROCK voice,"this is the first album i ever listened to, and i still listen to it. its inspiring. i think its cool how she sings,i like the synthisizers and guitars too.she doesnt sing like on this album anymore, but she is still awsome!"
3,lacking in power,"This is a good saw but lacks power, i used both a 10tpi blade and a 7tpi blade but the cut was slow compared to a 5amp saw i would recommend something with a little more power. i tried cutting pine so imagine something harder."
4,Makita 4324K 3.7 amp 115-volt jig saw,"This was a present for my husband. When it came the wrapping on the case was mess up. I would have been upset if it was a gift for someone else. My husband knew it was a gift I got on line, therefore he understood about the wrapping."
4,Lives up to the title,"An excellent resource for anyone interested in mathematical problem solving at the undergraduate level. Comes with many interesting problems taken from various mathematics contests. Additionally, the writing is clear and user-friendly. The only thing lacking is a companion workbook/solution guide. If you know anyone taking the AIME, USAMO, IMO, or Putnam exam, do them a favor and buy them this book! It's well worth it!"
4,Maxims That Make Us Wince,Very nice hard-cover edition of a classic of pithy observations on the nature of man. La Rochefoucald's Maxims force us to take an often disquieting look at ourselves and at the immutability of human nature.
4,More hits than the average Elton album,"So what if these aren't originals. A couple of these songs were hits only in the UK so they're new to me. According to the notes most of these Elton covers were hits over there. Its not surprising. This is the same Elton voice that is heard on all those hits from the early 70s. Naturally the session players sound like a late 60s pop band but there's nothing low budget about the productions or arrangements. The cheap looking cd cover is in fact the only thing wrong with this album. Most of these covers won't make you forget the originals but if you're an Elton fan that won't matter. Great songs, great covers."
1,Badly done,"I have to agree with the reviewer below who said this was a good story poorly told.The premise was good, which is why I picked up the book. Unfortunately, the execution leaves much to be desired. The author repeats herself often, particularly the parts about how admirable and wonderful and peaceful and strong she is. If she'd spent more time telling her story than waxing rhapsodic about herself, this could have gotten lots more stars."
5,A Story of Courage and Love,"I was really impressed with this book. Cindi is a remarkable woman to come through so much physical and mental pain and then to be able to forgive and move on with her life. It makes you grateful for what you have in life and shows you that amongst all the evil in the world there are still so many good people, helping each other. I really enjoyed reading this book and would urge others to do so."
5,the most beautifiul story I have ever read,This is a the most humbling and inspiring story I have ever read. Cindi should be so proud to know she has reached out to millions and given us all a huge hug. I feel I can overcome anything now after reading her story of survival. Thank You Cindi..
5,A Role Model for Us All,"Cindi Broaddus shows us how the human spirit can turn severely adverse circumstances into something good. Her account of a life altering, tragic event became life defining for her. This book inspires each of us to look for the good in life and make sure that is what we are giving to others. As she says, ""From one random act of violence has come so many random acts of kindness."""
3,Good,It was a good purchase. It was shipped quickly. I am happy with the product and the service. Would recommend it.
4,Nice remote,"This remote is great, except for lacking mouse control functionality. I ended up getting the ATI Remote Wonder a few months later, and it was much more satisfying. But this is a nice remote. Worth the purchase."
3,Not that Great.,Volume buttons are hard to find in the dark. Pause and play buttons are on the bottom which makes it difficult to push them while holding with one hand. Does not work with win dvd or other tv video programs I have. Works fine with Beyond Tv.
3,Thin!,"They are flimsy and thin, but my baby only used his bassinet for 2 months and then we didn't need them any more. If these were crib sheets that are meant to last for at least 2 years, I would be pretty dissatisfied."
1,Did Not Fit After Washing,"After receiving this product, I washed the sheets according to the care instructions on the label. The result was that the sheets are now unusable, because they do not fit the mattress. If I force them to fit onto the mattress, the mattress becomes warped, and too small for the cradle. A gap of 3 inches is formed between the mattress and edges of the cradle. In short, using this product would not only be inconvenient but unsafe for my baby. Avoid buying this product!"
4,Good to remember old salsa!,Excellent production.If you like oldies (salsa)you should have this c/d.
3,"mcfarlane sports, hocky two pack",this a average toy. it would be better if one of the players was a goalie. Then you would have a player shooting the puck and seeing if the goalie could save it. This puts up a good package but it is just boring. it is just ok.
3,A shorter film but still good,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Simon of the Desert (Simón del desierto) is another Buñuel film that has been talked about for a long time.It is about a man who has stood on a high column for years without leaving and has people bring him food. He later experiences visions and is tempted by the devil.This is one of Buñuel's films that has a religious theme and like the other sparked some controversy.Based on the brevity of this film, people have suggested it be a supplement to a DVD of another Buñuel film, but this DVD also has a supplement which are quite good. The main supplement is a retrospective of all of Buñuel's Mexican films. The other is an interview with Silvia Pinal, who appeared in this film.I too think the material on this release could have been included on another Criterion DVD of a Buñuel film, but this is still worth buying."
2,"Good skills, but writing is uneven.","This group should be better than it is. Group members demonstrate their flexibility and skills with a range of rap styles, including dancehall, gangsta and latin. However the lyrics are forgettable on most tracks. I kept waiting for them to really get busy, and it never seemed to happen. This is an excellant group desparately in search of a good producer. Then watch them roll!"
1,"REMASTERED, WHAT FROM VHS?, BEWARE CHEAP COPY","Paid extra for the remastered version (not that it cost's much anyway) none the less it's no more remastered than a different front cover which in itself is a cheap photocopied slip and the disc looks as though it's a backyard copy, quality of play is equal to a twenty year old VHS,I could make these on my computer, better off buying one of the original releases at least you get nice cover with better graphics."
1,Incredibly idiotic and incredibly funny!,"Don't let the rating fool you. This may be one of the worst movies ever made, but it is also, unquestionably, one of the funniest! In this ridiculous sci-fi horror flick, everything is atrocious: the script, the acting, not to mention the special effects. Who could forget the film's ""monster"" being nothing more than a siloutte of a lobster! One of my favorite effects are the flesh tearing ray guns the aliens use and leave nothing but the victim's skeleton (in one scene the editing is so bad that you can actually see the metal screws holding the prop together!) Fans of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Attack of the 50 Foot Tall Woman"", ""Eegah"", and ""The Creeping Terror"" will get a kick out of this film. It is a staple at ""All Time Worst Movies"" conventions. Don't hesitate to rent this one. It is a riot!"
5,WATCH-OUT FOR THAT RAY-GUN!,"After watching this movie, I wished that I had one those ray-guns so I could turn evil people intoskeletons. It sure would be a lot of them laying around. I thought this was a fun movie to watch.If you don't already have it, give it a try."
3,Lugers vs. rayguns?,I'm really surprised nobody mentioned the cops (all in plainclothes)using an assortment of pistols.I even spotted a German Luger from WWII.I loved it.
3,Fear the Giant Lobsters!,"David Love stars as Derek a Martian who winds up coming to Earth since he finds out that there is intelligent life on the planet. His fellow Martians are coming to Earth to raise the Gargon Herd which is a bunch of giant lobsters. Derek comes to town and winds up meeting Betty played by the lovely Dawn Bender (Island in the Sky, The Actress). She takes interest in Derek right away. Thor played by Bryan Grant comes to town looking for Derek and to bring him back so that they can unleash the Giant Lobsters. Derek has to make a sacrifice to try to stop the oncoming monsters and save Earth from what's about to happen. I would of given this a star but this was too much fun. Grant it's a horrible movie with bad acting, script etc.... but I just love it. The giant lobster was awesome. Also starring Harvey B. Dunn (My Fair Lady as Grandpa Morgan, King Moody (Nutt House, Sweet November) and the director Tom Graeff. He edited, produced, wrote and did all the things. Classic campy fun."
5,Best set of tables!!!,"Way better then pictured, easy to assemble, and probably the best customer service from the seller I've ever dealt with. I've always been a fan of my furniture to have a cool, sleak, and modern look to it. This fits that to a tee. I recommend this to anyone looking for a table set...and by the way, you won't find a better price...Buy it!"
5,Elegant and sturdy,These were easy to assemble and look great in my living room. No issues. Good quality furniture. You can assemble it yourself
5,Beautiful and Modern coffee table and end tables,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He was divorced a few years ago, and his wife took his good furniture. So, he ended up being 29 years old with college, first-apartment kind of stuff. A few months ago, he had wood floors put down in place of his old carpet, so I decided to help his house look like a grown man, not a college kid, lives here. These tables look fabulous!"
3,Friend and foe--but what's the issue?,"I read the German edition of this book. It's eerily simple to read. The space that Schmitt carves out here for the political seems to be a good idea: the political is essentially the field of tension between enemy and friend. Most political problems can be cast in these terms, but Schmitt does not go far enough. Unlike Hegel, there is no issue (Ding) between the enemy and friend. Yes, of course there are always oppositions, but the issue between the two parties is enormously important. Perhaps Schmitt would only say that the issue implies a party (even a third party) which cannot be impartial and so is only aligning itself. I don't buy this. I think it is enormously important for sides in a political conflict to look at what the issue at hand is, e.g., a land dispute, and then to work from there. According to Schmitt's view, there's nothing to do other than to maintain the opposition until defeat or victory. That is too limited an approach."
2,Obsolete already,"While the author seems to cover the topics well, including good useable code examples, much of the information is already obsolete. He obviously wrote this while the C# language was still in Beta 1, because many of the classes and methods he uses were removed, replaced, or renamed as of Beta 2. I can't believe they published a book written about a language before the language was officially finalized and released. It's very difficult to search the Internet, MSDN, etc. for all of the ""equivalent"" classes for the outdated ones the author uses... I recommend you find a newer and more accurate book."
2,Explanations are far too difficult to comprehend.....,"An earlier reviewer said he had trouble with delegates. I agree, he explains complicated things on a high level, then the simpler things that should already be known by programmers, he grinds into you. I went to a web-site and learned what I needed to about Delegates in one paragraph. Matt forgets to tell us (no pun intended) what delegates are... This is a decent reference, but as for learning the language, I would look to something else."
3,"""Get Your Feet Wet"" for Intermediate Programmers","WHERE I'M COMING FROM: Computer science grad student with academic experience in C++. 2 years professional ColdFusion and SQL. 1 year professional Java and PHP.WHAT I HAVE TO SAY: Eh. This book definitely doesn't talk down to developers with a medium level of experience, but it doesn't really spend all that much time on any one topic. Maybe I'm dense, but I still haven't caught on to its explanation of Delegates. This might be better for an Advanced Beginner than an Intermediate Programmer. This being my first C# book, I'm guessing it is middle of the road. I'm moving on to Petzold's Programming Windows with C#."
5,"Great service, product as promised!","I was quite happy to see that I received a normally priced ($15) CD in shrink-wrap of this invaluable Lionel Hampton disc! Shipping was fast, the disc and packaging were undamaged. Exactly what you want to see."
2,Disliked this book and the instructor that taught the class.,"Boring book, had to buy it for a required diversity credit in order to graduate from Purdue University. The instructor was a stuck up lady that thought her intro to African American class should be an actual class where students should be graded harshly on grammar and content, instead of teaching the class to inspire young people to blur the lines of diversity.I guess it would have been a good book if the instructor used it correctly.2 stars for the excellent packaging it arrived in."
5,Wonderful book,"When I was about 15 I read the story for the first (of many) times. Over ten years has passed, and yet it remains one of my very favorite romance novels. Thank you for writing a wonderful book, Ms. Conklin. You're right-- teenagers can handle dealing with tough issues like illness and mortality. Thank you for sharing your gift with us."
3,P.S. I Love You,This book was very threatening to society and exposed a very personal side of Mariah's life. Her and Da'Book cooked up a whole lot of controversy with their famous words. Mariah's belching was also very unattractive and garlic-y.
4,Great Quartet-Style Gospel,"I had been looking for the original recording of one song for a while, and finally found it here. The Pilgrim Jubilees lived up totheir reputation here. Just like Church!"
5,JUST A KISS,"This CD is one of my favorites. I play itover and over, it's the main reason I'm goingto learn to speak Spanish. I guarantee you'lllove this CD as I do.Richard Jones"
5,Another top-notch chapter in an excellent series.,"No amount of superlatives can do this series justice, this novel just continues the upward trend this series has shown since it started.That said, this one makes up for the slighty disappointing 'Doomstar Relic' and then some.This chapter features revelations aplenty and lots of well executed interpersonal banter and even humor. The Kane/Beth-li/Brigid triangle is a riot and is the best feature of the slow start to this novel. After the opening gambit things don't let up for a second, this is a 'read-in-one-night' book that's for sure!The ending sets up what sounds like a great new direction for the series which seems like it could be along the lines of one of my personal favourites 'Omega Path'.Consistently quality stuff in a genre that's not normally known for such things. If you're not an Outlanders fan by now, you should be!"
5,Wave....,"I first heard the opening track of this CD on my local NPR station, and searched and searched to find it. Those who feel this doesn't show off India's remarkable vocal range and control, need only listen to that track. The rest of the album is icing on the cake. Listening to the give and take of this collaboration is exciting. Obviously, a seasoned, but dynamic performance by Tito, coupled with the fire of India's vocal treatment lends something to this set. Definitely worth the time if you are a fan of either of these artists."
2,"This album is not great, but tolerable...","""La India"" has produced excellent songs in past albums--danceable and beautiful beats. However, I was disaapointed with this one. ""Jazzin"" definitely has a jazzy, upbeat appeal and features old jazz classics, but these ""old-timers"" do little, if any, justice to the soulful, powerful, and youthful voice of India. Tito Puente also delivers, but salsa music is where the both of them deliver best!"
1,Do not buy this product,"I purchased Bare-Minerals starter kit and it is the worst makeup I have ever used in my entire life! I saw the infomercial on t.v. and it really had me convinced that this makeup would leave my skin flawless. Trust me, what you see on t.v. is not what you get. I have a few blemishes on my skin and all this makeup did was make them stand out even more. The makeup doesn't spread evenly so it left my skin looking blotchy. I'm only 29 years old but this makeup managed to make my skin look old and washed out. This product is a complete rip-off! I'm going back to my cover girl liquid foundation and pressed powder....."
3,I do not like most of the songs on this CD.,"I was very disappointed in the sound quality and the selection of songs on this CD. Since I am not a music expert, don't take my word for it, however."
1,Absolute nonsense.,"It was my own fault....looking for a book about Packer, but didn't see that this book is FICTION. Why anyone would want to read a fictional portrayal of a real person, I can't say (On the other hand, that would be the ONLY way to make George Bush II seem intelligent).I actually read several pages before I realized this was crap. It did surprise me that a mountain man from the 1800's could write so well, but I kept reading.Then I read Packer's claim that he had sailed on the Mary Celeste. AHA! THEN I turned the book around to see that it was all make believe.So you see, it was my fault. That said, if you enjoy crap, buy this book."
4,Pilgrim's Progress,"This is a strong video; after watching it the first time my three-year-old exclaimed, ""I want to go to HEAVEN!"" My seven-year-old started worrying that his parents will go to hell. So be prepared to respond to strong reactions.I personally found it exciting, authentic, and spiritually nourishing.The colorful animated production is surprisingly artistic in spots. The actor who does the voice of Evangelist and the Judge is not so talented; however overall it's a fine performance of the Christian classic. I am glad that I own it."
5,Pilrim's Progress winner,"The Pilgrim's ProgressThis is a good shortened story of this great allegory written by the Christian, John Bunyan, in the 1600's."
1,Disappointed,"The Pilgrim's Progress is one of my favorite books. I was excited to see an animated version, and hopeful to share it with the youth group that I lead at church. I decided to preview the movie at home before showing it to a group of pre-teens. Yes, the message is excellent. However, the voice-over acting is boring and bland, using the same actor for many characters. The computer animation looks much like a video game from the late 90's. When Christian is met by Apollyon, the animation reminded me of meeting a ""boss"" while playing Zelda. I was also disappointed that there wasn't any closed-captioning or subtitle option in the DVD menu. The idea to produce an animated version of this was good. I regret that it didn't come close to standards that would highlight Bunyan's writing. There must be plenty of Christian actors, directors, and artists in this world who would surely like to put our pilgrim, Christian, on the adventure map with Frodo Baggins, or our friends in Narnia!"
3,It is alright.,"My kids, 5,7 & 9 yrs, read The Pilgrims Progress book first and then watched this DVD. The were a little disappointed. The animation is a little dated and the acting/reading was a bit too dead pan for their taste. They seemed to just be reading their lines and not acting them out.The movie follows the book closely but my kids were a little sad that it only included Christian's journey and not Christiana's as well. I had to explain that the movie was already an hour long and that it would take that long again and some to tell the other story as well.Overall It was fine. My kids watched the whole thing but I don't think it will become a favorite. I was hoping for more but got about what I thought it would be. Perhaps I will try a live action version instead."
4,An interesting if inappropriate change of pace and direction.,"On this album, Freddie Jackson's producers utilized a more aggressive and more ""urban"" approach--as a result, he did not do as many classic soul-flavored ballads and there were quite a few New Jack Swing influences all over--with mixed results at best. ""Paradise"", ""Make Love Easy"", the poignant ""My Family"" and the upbeat and groovy ""Was It Something?"" are this one's best offerings. The other tracks all attempt to give the youngerR&B/Hip-hoppers a run for their money but are not reflective of the great material found on Freddie's Capitol releases at all."
1,Expensive price for an advert !,"If the technology is certainly interesting and full of promises, the book is not. It contains only basic information on ESRI's products and a CD with demos that you can find on the ESRI web pages. ESRI's white papers offer much more material for free. Last but not least, this emerging technology is changing constantly and the book is already outdated in many point of views. Don't bother buying it and spend more time reading online GIS magazine which will keep you informed every day about new web mapping sites. And yes, there are other GIS developers than ESRI..."
5,a high level overview,"While not going into much detail about the technical aspects of publishing maps on the net, this book does provide a useful overview. For examples on how large organizations use the Internet to deliver spatial information, there are some good case studies. The technology is changing raidly, however, so the book is becoming slightly dated."
5,STIFF NECK THERAPY,THIS PILLOW HELPS MY OCCASIONAL STIFF NECK - I AM ADDICTED TO SLEEPING WITH IT - IT ESPECIALLY HELPS IF YOU CRADLE IT AROUND YOUR NECK AND SLEEP ON YOUR BACK - I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE COVER COMES OFF TO BE WASHED. THE COVER IS A VELOUR TYPE COVER - VERY SOFT AND COMFY. RECOMMEND THIS NECK PILLOW.
2,Doesn't Work for Me,"I had high hopes for this pillow. Unfortunately it just feels to hard. Doesn't give like I thought a memory foam should. I don't use it at all. I used it for about a month and stopped. I tried again, nope. Again, nope."
1,Kindle version is not worth it,"The star-rating is for the Kindle version.The comic itself was quite good; I'd give it 4/5. Although the general theme is about the public domain, the concepts are specifically illustrated by discussing how copyright laws and, to a lesser degree, trademark laws, are implicated in the making of a documentary. The explanations can be a bit confusing because of the level of detail, but I think that this is more because of the nature of copyright law than the authors' ability to put it into writing.My problem with this book is with the Kindle format. First, the scans make the writing tiny and I couldn't make out some of the clippings that they used. The pages only fill up 3/4 of the screen; I tried to adjust the size to fill the screen but I couldn't figure out how to do it in the end. Secondly, I felt a bit ripped off after discovering free digital versions can be found on the Duke Law website:[..]"
2,Not my style,"I'm sure a lot of people enjoy information being given via a graphic novel/ ""comic book."" I didn't. I found it a hard read at times."
4,EL TOPO THE NOTORIOUS JORODOFSKY FILM IS NOT ON VIDEO,"Every time you see the mexican film EL TOPO on video it is always a bootleg. Even at the video store for rental. The same holds true for THE HOLY MOUNTAIN and the Beatles LET IT BE. They are all three owned by apple records ceo Allen Klein, and he won't even return Alejandro Jorodofsky's phone calls to put them on video. What is Klein waiting for? They are on Japanese laserdisk which is the source of the vhs copies, and just like napster, Jorodofsky encourages film buffs to seek these films out anyway they can! Santa Sangre is on video, however."
2,of limited use,"This book has very few pictures, but many useful tips. I gave it only 2 stars because I would have liked to see how the tips and instructions translated into actual bathrooms. I did not find this book to be very inspiring, but it might be more useful to someone who is remodeling their bathroom."
5,Great Gift!,This is a very unique gift for anyone. Chocolate is very good and the presentation is great. Great to take to a Xmas Party to give the host. Eveyone will be fighting to get to try a few. And with 48 in the box it will go pretty far. It is not strong but you get great flavor of the liquor filling.
1,No treat,Low quality item. I was gravely disappointed. The candies had leaked and turned to a thick goo. Pay a little more and go with a recognizable name. You will not be happy with this candy.
2,TERRIBLE,"THESE ARE REALLY BAD. I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LIQUOR INSIDE, BUT I DIDN'T TAST ANY. AND THE CHOCOLATE WASN'T VERY GOOD."
1,Came Late and Melted,"Product was supposed to show up before a family went on a trip, paid and extra $3.99 for one day.. Showed up late and melted, with no apology!"
3,Much smaller than the picture leads one to believe,"Delivery of the product was quick, however the items are smaller than how they appear on line. Next time I would order the larger size."
1,Product with alcohol,First time I have tried....bad s hipping which amazon corrected but the product was poor..the chocolate not as good as Anthony Berg and surely NO alcohol...there was hardly any flavor..will never buy again and do NOT recommend.
3,Christmas Gift,"These liquor filled chocolates were tasty, even though I couldn't really distinguish one flavor of liquor from another. I only gave it a 3 star rating because of how difficult it was to remove the foil wrapper from the chocolate. I would never gain weight from eating too many of the candies because it was too much effort to remove the wrapper. The foil peels off in tiny little pieces, making it hard to remove all of it quickly. But it's a nice festive treat to serve to a group of people."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"All dark chocolate. The wrappers were difficult to remove, came off in pieces. I did like the filling though not so sure there was more than a drop of booze in each one. I personally dont care about that. But I am assuming most who buy these are expecting to taste the alcohol. I think even hershey chocolate tastes better than this, and I don't really like hershey chocolate. I just expected better quality chocolate for the price."
3,Teeny Tiny,"The bottles are REALLY small, and hard to unwrap. The liquor inside is not liquid, but a gel. The chocoalte is all dark, no milk chocolate, but very smooth. They taste really good though."
2,Liquor filled chocolates,The chocolates were leaking and some were broken. The foil rappers were hard to remove due to the leaking of the liquid center. Would not buy this product again.
3,Needs better packaging!!,"The item came in a larger box with a CD that was also ordered. The box had no padding or anything in it stop the contents from being bounced around. I wanted to give it as a gift, however it came damaged and looks like it had been passed around a number of times."
3,ok i guess,last year i ordered my dad the 64 piece box set it was great well this year i ordered this set it was ok he still like but it was more gel like inside
3,Look and taste good,I liked the taste and presentation of this product but it was a little messy to eat. Most of the bottles leak out of the bottom of their package. I think that I would like them better if they were a little larger. Maby reduce the number to about 24 or 36 to the pack with the same volumn.
4,Pretty good,It seemed as though they may have sat for awhile. The foil stuck to the chocolate a bit which made it hard to unwrap. But tasted good.
4,re: Liquor Filled chocolates,"Yes, I enjoyed the recent purchase I made of liquor filled chocolates. They were gotten for gifts to be split up in packages. Everything arrived in purfect shape and no complaints,"
4,chocolate liquor!,"These are so adorable! They came promptly and are as described, except the size. I don't know if it was mentioned and i just missed it, but these chocolates are very very tiny! and maybe a little overpriced. Great product otherwise!"
2,Where's the liquor?,I love liquor-filled chocolates. I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong. It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these. The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.
4,Great Gift,I often order this product to give to others. This is a GREAT gift! Everyone to whom I have gioven this product as a present really enjoys it. This is more special becuase anyone can give chocolate. This is different and cannot be purchased at regular stores in many states.
1,NOT Very Special Liquor: ordered this mistake by mistake,"I meant to order Anthony Berg's chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome. The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...don't make the mistake that i made..."
5,great historical study,"Professor Campbell brings to light the institution of slavery of slavery in antebellum Texas. Many Texans have no idea of the significant role that slavery played in its beginnings as a nation and a state. Campbell uses hard evidence to support his work (newspapers, census, private letters, first hand accounts, etc.).This work goes into detail about the lives and dealings (literally) of slaves. Several anecdotal instances are given for just about every aspect of slave life. Texas slavery also reflects the slavery practices of other southern US states, so this is handy to have for a study of American slavery in general.Professor Campbell's book is indeed steeped in historical scholarship, but it is nevertheless pleasant to read and easily understood. I highly recommend this book for students(or those interested in) Texas history, the American Antebellum South, or slavery in 19th century America."
1,"Sweet Jesus, what a mess","Inchoate and rambling, ungrammatical and mispunctuated, Suzanne Olsson's ""Jesus in Kashmir"" reads like the rough first draft of a book that would probably have best been left unwritten. It's a grab bag of (to put it kindly) highly speculative ideas without a shred of verifiable evidence to back them up. Any author who quotes the Vatican, as Ms. Olsson does, to back up her contention that aliens were somehow (and I could never quite make out how) involved in Jesus's mission and his sojourn in Kashmir is difficult to take seriously."
5,One of the Best researchs i've read yet.,"Time and travels done in these researchs will resound into the futures and make reason with the religions and unturned answers, into the Mysteries of some of the unknowns of Christ's past travels in far east."
4,An Indispensable Classic,"An Indispensable Classic that will be of interest to anyone interested in how the""modern"" world has come about."
1,Not What I Thought,"I bought this CD for a song that was on the radio in the early 90's called ""Every Day Of My Life"". The song on this CD is not the version that was on the radio, it is a cheesy ""pop"" version. There is one other song that's Ok, but I wouldn't spend the money."
3,A Marvelous Reunion.,"I think Willie Neal Johnson is one of the best seasoned singers in the quartet circuit. Every project he releases showcases his love for God and gospel music. His fellow tag team partner, Paul Beasley, proves once and for all he is one of the smoothest falsetto tenors quartet music has ever produced. Listen to the title cut ""Help me to be Strong"" and you will see what I mean. Willie Neal Johnson's love of kids is demonstrated on the title cut ""Little Boys and Little Girls"". he comments that in a generation we're living in today, little children should be brought up in the admonition of God."
2,Quartet music is swiftly losing it's place in gospel music.,"To tell you the truth, I really don't know what to say about this CD. While it does have potential, it cannot boast of ""A"" quality songs. I feel that in order for this tape to reach its full accolades(many which have passed by already) I think some re-formatting and group intra-structure strength needs to be improved and even more so, maintained. My brother says you all need to stabilize. But hey, God is good, isn't he?"
1,Pretty bad iron,"I've had this iron for about 6 months. The steam only works if I press the ""shot of steam"" button. The iron doesn't get hot enough and it keeps turning itself off while I am ironing. All in all I'm sorry I wasted 25 bucks on it."
1,Didn't Work,The iron was broken when it arrived. The plate would not heat unless I picked the iron up. It appears that the auto-off switch was defective.
3,Black & Decker D1700 Digital Edge Iron,"I am not impressed with this particular iron. It does not stay on the setting it's set for. Example: When I set it to 4, after a bit it goes to 3; then back to 4, and back and forth like that - beeping each time it changes. It is so annoying. I am a professional seamstress, so I use it all day long. I really expected more out of Black & Decker. However, this iron does not scorch my fabric, which is what I was looking for. The ceramic soleplate is awesome for protection. I had bought an iron from them 25 years before, and it is still working. That's why I went with them, again. I'm not sure I will buy from them again. Black & Decker sent out a ""comparable"" replacement iron. However, it is not comparable to what I bought. It is not digital and does not have a ceramic or teflon soleplate. I am also experiencing problems with it heating up to the correct setting."
1,Leaks constantly,"I've had this iron for a few years and only use it occasionally. Despite how occasionally I use it, I really hate this iron. Every time I use it it drips water on my clothes. For years I thought it was just condensation from the steam, or perhaps it was dripping too much water onto the plate. Today I discovered it has actually been dripping from the base of the unit, close to the cord wind/stand. What? Obviously something in the housing is cracked or malfunctioned. If I had known this when it was in warranty I'd have taken it back. I'm not sure I'll ever buy another B&D iron."
2,Worked for two weeks and seller had lousy service,I loved my old digital iron from a different brand and thought I would give this one a break despite the negative reviews. It worked phenomenal for two weeks. And then it stopped. The digital gauge went out and the heating surface stopped working.The seller took one month and would have taken longer to refund my payment if I hadn't filed an A-Z claim with Amazon.Buyer beware! Item and seller rate low on my satisfaction rating.
1,Buyers beware!!,"My wife was looking specifically for an iron with a ceramic sole plate. We saw the reviews and were concerned, but since it wasn't terribly expensive we decided to give it a try. As the others have said, for the first couple of months it was great...BUT!We bought it in October of 2010, it's now December and it just died. The iron beeps and blinks, but never heats up. After about 30 seconds (or so), the green display beeps and reads ""ERR OR"". Essentially, it's dead now...it doesn't work at all.If you Google ""black and decker"" and ""ERR OR"" you will find that we're not alone. It's too bad because my wife really liked the way it worked, but unfortunately it's a VERY poor quality product that is likely going to break on you after a few months of use.Suggest that you stay away and look for a better brand that is built right."
4,Very nice iron for the money!,"Am still getting used to this iron, but so far very good product! Love the ""auto shut-off"" feature because I always forget to shut it off. And the shot of steam that thing puts out will amaze you. Great iron!"
1,pass the goo please~ do not buy.,"At first Iron pressed beautifully then some kind of goo started to leak from the front??? I thought....okay how weird? so I cleaned iron and restarted. more goo. returning to the store, this iron started acting like this right out of the box!!! for a Black and Decker...Very disappointed."
1,Another one bites the dust,"This iron is a piece of junk! I bought it in March of this year and yesterday it died. This was my third and last B&D iron. The most any of them lasted was 16 months, poor reliabilty and quality control. I will never buy another B&D iron!"
5,love the car.,"Lights works, turn on a dime, fast. Have fun all over the house. Have no dislikes. Would buy again. wow."
1,Bangville Robbery,Amazon should give everyone who bought this a free DVD. An 8 minute dvd--give me a break.
4,"A dozen years later, this book still holds up","""Greetings From This Modern World,"" published back in 1992 collects Tom Tomorrow's politically charged comic strips from 1989 through the end of 1991. While the content itself is over a dozen years old the book still manages to read as if it were published weeks ago with the bulk of its subject matter covering George Bush (Sr.), Iraq and Sadaam Hussein, big government and the warped skewering of 'news' by media broadcasters/publishers/advertisers. While the book will entertain with its razor-sharp aesthetic of sarcasm and political commentary it is somewhat unsettling when realizing how little things have changed since this book was first published."
4,"this title dated, but...","I love Tom Tomorrows's THIS MODERN WORLD, read it avidly in the local alternative press, and so was delighted to find a copy of this particular title at our local publiclibrary.These cartoons are a bit old now...circa the Gulf War & aftermath. But they're still quite funny...We need Tom'sinsights now more than ever with the war-hysteria that isonce again gripping our nation (the Gulf War segments inthis collection take on an eerie ring of familiarity inrecent days).I've kept up with Tom's latest cartoons and he hasn'tmissed a beat. Thank you Tom!"
2,not so tough,"This is a nice product, but it is not as tough as it might appear. It will not plow through a particularly tough shell and the blades tweek under pressure and are not as sharp as expected for what appears to be an otherwise heavy duty tool. This will not perform much better than a modest set of seafood shears."
4,Watch out for pinched fingers,"After years of using lobster snippers that couldn't cleaning cut through the shell, I love the weight, balance and design of these. Unfortunately, that notch behind the hinge will really squeeze the skin on your hand if you are not careful. We all have been pinched, sometimes twice during a meal as we cannot at first determine where the problem is. Love the cutting, dislike the risk of injury."
5,Harper's best,"Sort of a cult figure, Roy Harper has been active in London's folk scene since 1965. 'Stormcock', easily his best, was released in 1971 following his drugier 1970 effort 'Flat,Baroque and Berserk' (which, by the way, desrves to be re issued)All 4 songs are personal and moody, yet mature both lyrically and musically. True, Jimmy Page is featured here, but make no mistake, Harper himself is an acoustic guitar wizard.This is one of those albums that you will never get tired listening to. It kind of rubs on you with each listening.Essential for folk lovers and guitar players."
5,thank you roy,I can only say that every record/ cd collection of every person on the planet earth should have this in it. the world would be a better place.
5,A MASTERPIECE OF FOLK-ROCK.,"Roy Harper is an Englishman whose songs are a celebration of life itself. Stormcock is the best intoduction to this great artist's work. The provocative intensity of his lyrics(in the spirit of Bob Dylan)combined with the matching drive of his performance(""The Same Old Rock"", and the beautiful love song ""Me And My Woman,"") makes Stormcock an album that grows richer with the passage of time, and each listening will reveal some new facet to the listener. This album is pure poetic magic."
5,"Roy Harper, The Shakespere of Rock and Roll","This cd is one of the top 3 best by Roy. He is one of the best on the guitar, his playing is distinct, and recognizable. His ""snaky"" ""one man rock and roll band"" is one of my favorites. the rest of the album is just as good. this is one of Roy's favorites too. Roy is my favorite artist, can you tell?"
2,"SHORT BOOK, LONG READ","THE TONE IS VERY EDUCATED BUT THIS BOOK IS SIMPLY NOT CLEAR OR LUCID. I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME JUST GETTING THROUGH IT. HINDUISM IS A DIFFICULT ENOUGH SUBJECT WITHOUT ADDING A BRITISH STYLE AUTHOR TO CONFOUND MATTERS FURTHER, IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT."
3,A look at the forgotten computer,"This 1984's book explains the ideas behind Lisa's GUI and its seven applications. Since mouse-operated computers were a rarity 20 years ago, the author describes everything with a great level of detail -- complete with screenshots of most menus, crucial dialog boxes, mouse pointers, etc. When read today, it is a fascinating testimony to where we started and how far have we gone. It's unbelievable how many things were already there in Lisa's system, but even more astonishing how often users had to put up with system's limitations. The book also contains basic information about Apple Lisa, as well as tear-in-the-eye conclusion about Lisa's future."
4,Watch out for the sanke for he is crafty.,Very informative and exciting to read through. Pictures and photography well displayed. Great visual and usage of similar situations relating to the natural behaviors of rattlesnakes. Simple and interesting for children to read and understand.
2,I couldn't finish,"I started this book, but lost interest about a third of the way through. There is one think I can say for the inexpensive Kindle books Amazon has. If you don't like one, you've only lost a buck or two."
5,Jedediah Smith Was a Man,"Jedediah Smith's life in the west is a truly amazing tale of adventure, endurance, violence, devotion, and courage.Jedediah Smith was a very interesting man, perhaps an enigma. Well educated and deeply religious, he chose to spend much of his life in a lawless, bookless society. No doubt the irresistable call of adventure as well as the curiosity as to what lies on the other side of that hill called the young man to this life.Most amazing is the stoic response to incredible hardships these men showed. Being attacked by indians, scalped by a bear, lost in the mountains and walking across vast, unknown deserts did not deter this man. Remarkable!Jedediah Smith's journal is one of the few sources of information about the lives and travels of the mountain men of the early 1800s. Imagine the stories that would be available to us had more of the mountain men been able to document their adventures."
2,"Much detail, but mostly boring","I couldn't finish the book. The detail and trivia was amazing, but it became numbingly boring. The author has been a superb researcher, but he'll drown you in detail that quickly becomes uninteresting."
3,Mostly Smith Snippets,"The author ACHED to piece together enough of Jedediah Smith's life to merit a book. Alas, too little. The book's value is in its overall description of the 1820's west of the Mississippi."
2,Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West,"Far too little about Jededian himself. Probably no more than a couple of pages at best. Spent the whole book talking about other figures in detail like Ashley. Smith was treated like an obscure character that played a very small role during that period, when in fact he was one of he few icons."
3,OK read,"Found it eazy read but not much addition informatiom on J Smith, more about times was disapointed sorry can't recommend"
2,Wrong cd,this was not the version of the song i was looking for....but i believe i made the mistake in ordering this particular cd
2,Children?,"I have all of the Mississippi Children's Choir's CDs and found this to be a little disappointing. The songs are good, but the children who were so child-like in the other CDs, seemed to sound so much older in this one. Most of the solos are WAY overdone. The things that made them sound ""cute"" as children don't seem to work with older teenage voices. They've seem to have lost their innocence in a way. There are a couple of good songs on the CD and if it wasn't for the overdone solos on most of the others, I would like this CD more."
5,You can't go wrong with these shoes.,"Hey, these are Fila. My son love these shoes and for him are his 'special' occassion shoes! He suggests we get him another pair in a larger size as he is 11 years and still growing."
1,Run as fast from this shoe! Worst shoe I ever purchased!,"This shoe is great if your into bondage. The sole is very small and does not allow for your foot to naturally expand as you walk in the shoe. Wearing these shoes I feel as if I have ingrown toe nails. Shoe stretchers do not work either, it may provide some measure of comfort but this shoe needs to go back to the drawing board. Buyer beware! If you are into ancient Chinese foot binding this shoe is for you!"
5,The Best Pink Panther Soundtrack,I found this to be the best Pink Panther soundtrack. It sounds good and covers music from the entire film. It is a must for Pink Panther fans.
3,Cultural conclusions from ancient physical evidence?,"Fagan Brian. From Black Land to Fifth Sun. 1997. This is a look at the physical evidence that enables archaeologists to make conclusions regarding the belief systems of cultures long past. Is it valid to draw parallels between the Cro-Magnon people who lived in what is today, France, of 30,000 years ago and the San of the Kalahari in today's Botswana in Africa?"
2,Caveat Lector! Translation: Reader Beware!,"Readers should note that if you do not read Latin (and I don't), you will not be able to read the actual epistles in this book - only the introduction and the commentary. Since I will have to order another version of the Heroides to actually read the ancient text, I cannot yet comment on the English commentary included in this book! I am giving it a two for now."
4,Bring this with you...,"I had a few extra days in San Francisco on a recent trip, so I got this hilarious and irreverent guide to the ""unknown"" San Francisco. Boulware gives us the insider's tour of weird Chinatown bars, the Coltrane Museum, the scary Musee Mechanique, wife-swapping motels for swingers and much much more. With hours, phone numbers and directions for the very intrepid explorer. A must for even the most jaded Bay Area lifers."
3,shows a Faint mark when positive,"hi, i brought this item when we were trying to conceive.. i do remember those days each month, waiting for the mark to turn positive. These strips are definitely cheaper and allowed me to not hesitate to test frequently. Finally, when my period actually got delayed by 4 days (and i later found out i was pregnant), this strip turned positive but, only indicates a faint positive line.. i repeated the test again the next morning, still showed a FAINT positive line. i guess, i would have been much more excited to see a darker positive line .. so i had to run to walgreens and buy a few different brands, just to come home and confirm that i Truly am positive and there is no doubt about my pregnancy !!"
2,"Perhaps right for some, but not for me.","I bought this scanner to pair with my windows mobile 6 professional device. I spend much of a day attempting to get it to work properly and it never happened. First of all, the baracoda website did not even have software on their site for windows mobile 6. I had to call and tech support emailed me a beta program with quite a few bugs. I did find the gentleman at tech support to be patient and helpful, but we never truly worked anything out. Once the scanner was connected to my device, it would not really read any barcodes but a few and then it submitted over 5 numbers instead of actually reading the barcode. The Pencil 2 never read a bar code on a CD which is why I purchased it.Unlike the other reviewer, I thought the best part of this scanner was the Stylus function. It was not perfect but it worked and would have worked very well if I could have ever got the scanner to work properly.Needless to say, I am returning the product for a refund."
5,Excellent Breadth,This book was assigned reading for a college class on Sustainable Development. I'd already had some exposure to the philosophies & theories presented. It seems to be a good collection representing a wide range of ideas; a great piece for my reference shelf. In other words: a keeper!
5,a splendid collection of leading eco thinkers and writers....,"....ably assembled and edited by Michael E. Zimmerman. This anthology spans the spectrum from animal rights to environmental protection to deep ecology, and by doing so provides a superb introduction to environmental studies as well as important supplementary reading reaching forward into the present."
3,Re: The Bounty Man,"Bounty hunter Ross Dunbar unwittingly places a widow and her son in danger when he seeks to return her dead husband's personal effects.Dunbar is forced to take on two dangerous outlaws to protect himself and the woman and her son.There's some good suspense here, but Patten has done better stories before.I recommend instead:Showdown At MesillaThe Law In CottonwoodThe Arrogant Guns"
3,Average book,"Compared to the other Betty Crocker cook book, I was not as impressed with this book as others who wrote reviews. I was disappointed that there was not a dessert section, and annoyed that there is an inclusion for how to make it a 'meat' dish. Overall it is okay, but my other veggie books are much better."
2,Amazing how someone can turn 50 pages to 500 pages,"I am amazed how someone can write 500 pages about a 50 pages subject. The only thing that the book does not cover is counter-terrorism. Too many unrelated drawings to fill pages, too many times reapting the same subject with different heading. Just assembling bunch of un-related stuff in a book."
2,Superficial and disappointing,"I have to agree with the views of the other ""not so good"" reviewers. I am looking for leads in a very exciting area and this book seems to provide little more than superficial comment and a nostalgia towards 9/11. I agree that the diagrams are rather perfunctory and the repetetiveness gets rather tedious. Some of the definitions around this subject area need clarification and this has not satisfied this requirement. There's little doubt that there is a growing and exciting research area here but I feel this book is rather premature and does little more than try to be a ""first"" in this area. We need a follow up text that gets down to the nitty gritty of the technicalities. This book is completely technically-shy. A great pity, but perhaps in its defense it never purported to be any other."
3,Informative book,Author has a very easy to read writing style and I enjoyed reading this book. However the author has a tendency to repeat certain points and over emphasize certain other aspects. A very good overview of data mining and counter-terrorism. Would have liked to have seen more details on applying data mining for counter-terrorism. This part of the book while clear could have had more details.
4,Interesting Book,I am new to the field of data mining and this book provides a very good overview of data mining and web mining. It also provides some discussion on counter-terrorism and shows at a very high level how data mining could be applied for counter-terrorism. I would have liked to have seen more details step by step how data mining techniques could be used for this purpose. I understand that this is a new area and the author has done a good job in explaining the issues and concepts. Perhaps as the field matures a book discussing the algorithms and applications would be beneficial especially for the analysts who will be using the tools.
2,No Bonus Disc with BGO,"This is a fine album, but please be aware that the better remaster is Esoteric (2007), which contains a bonus track on Disc one and the Bonus Disc recorded live at the Whisky a Go Go. I have listened to both, and I personally believe the 2007 Esoteric remaster sounds better than the 1993 BGO remaster, and the BGO contains no bonus material."
3,A 70's period piece,An interesting book. But not nearly as comprehensive and thoughtful as Thomas Hauser's biography. One gets the feeling that Ali was looking to make a few bucks without spilling his guts.
5,"Quick, tasty Marinade for Chicken",This is a quick and simple marinade resulting in delicious chicken. The taste is very authentically Thai and very popular with children and adults alike.
5,DFX Gold Methods - Excellent,"For an excellent understanding of how to search for gold objects with you DFX, this is the book! It's full of great examples and explanations. You will understand how to use your DFX for hunting gold jewelry after reading this booklet. You need to have a reasonable understanding of, and some experience with, your DFX to get the full value from this. It may not be for the brand new user, but do not miss the opportunity to buy this and read it. It is invaluable!DFX Gold Methods (Finding Gold Jewelry with the White's Spectrum DFX ""E"" Series Metal Detector)"
3,AWESOME BOOK!!!,"I took this book hiking, as a companion. It is easy to understand and perfect for those reaching for somthing more in life. The pictures are beautiful."
5,A Very Good Read,"First it was Shibumi which I found to be OK. So I decided to read Trevanian's first effort. The Eiger Sanction was very exciting and well written to the very end. A real page turner, fun to read, and now it's off to rent the DVD with Clint Eastwood and to read the Loo Sanction."
5,Great escape reading!,"Trevanian is one of my favorite authors. I have read all his books and would recommend them all. It's great to take one of his books on vacation. The story keeps you engaged right up to the end. His writing style is humorous at times, but always interesting. Get them all."
5,One of the Best Spy Capers Ever Written!,"I recall seeing The Eiger Sanction starring Clint Eastwood years ago and while I enjoyed the movie, there were some parts I didn't quite understand .....So, I read the book and I'm glad I did. In my opinion, it was far better and more believable than SHIBUMI. The book was definitely better than the movie although the action in the movie was about as close to the book's action as you could get. I'm reading the Loo Sanction now and it is an excellent sequel! I wish Trevanian had written a whole series of adventure novels featuring Jonathan Hemlock, but somehow that doesn't seem like his style."
4,007 on the Eiger,"This is a fast-paced and entertaining thriller, spy novel and well-needed satire of the intelligence (?) community. Dr. Hemlock is not precisely James Bond. He's a climber, art professor, ladies man, and a conscience-free assassin who only kills to support his illegal art collection. He wants to retire from killing, but as in many other books and movies, he's forced into one last job...And it's a tough one. The climbing details add to the suspense and drama. Now it's time to watch the movie again."
3,A decent book,"The Eiger Sanction is entertaining, and it kept me turning pages, but it's not Trevanian's best work. I would highly recommend Shibumi, which is better in every aspect. Don't waste your time with Loo Sanction, you will be disappointed."
2,Dated beyond readability,"I tried to stick with this book. I picked it up and attempted to read a few pages time and again until I was pretty far into it. Let me just say that this book is beyond painful to read. I couldn't get to the end no matter how hard I tried.All of these glowing reviews here make me wonder about my sanity. I enjoy James Bond and a knock off would not be unwelcome. However, if you ever turn on AMC or watch old flicks from the late 60's, early 70's, you will occasionally see a movie with Lee Marvin or some other B actor playing the part of a Hammy James Bond. James Coburn played perhaps the worst knock off in my book with his roll as ""flint"". This was a hugely successful series back in its day, but try and watch it now and your in for a hard time. Bad acting, silly plot, demeaning towards women, insanely over the top character development... all of this you will find in Eiger Sanction.This is just a really bad book."
1,"Tedious, couldn't wait to finish","I recently read a book called ""The Eiger Sanction."" I found it very poorly written: no meat for the intellect--- it provides merely vulgar entertainment for the gonads. There is nothing one can sink one's cerebral cortex into. It is sensation for the sake of stimulation, with nothing to occupy the mind. While billed as a ""spy novel,"" there is very little inside to suggest this. There is no witty plot; no cleverness on the part of the characters. The main character is mentally ill, tasteless, uninteresting, and a murdering sociopath--- and is also *BORING!* If meeting such a person in real life, one would not waste one's time even saying ""Hello"" to him: it's a waste of time spending three or four days reading about him. The author doesn't even have him face justice for his murders: he's rewarded for his killings."
2,If you have 4 minutes to kill waiting for warm water . . .,"This unit takes 3-4 minutes to make hot water for tea, compared to 90 seconds on other machines. I would put up with 2 minutes for the cheap price, but this is absurd. I do like the manual door open and the ""add minute"" feature, but I wouldn't buy another goldstar because the power is just not there."
5,Lucas Transmission Fix Works,The transmission in my 2004 Sienna started slipping at 40K miles and just got worse every year. Lucas Transmission Fix eliminated all of the transmission slipping immediately when I added it at 140K miles.
2,vw/01M trans,I have the notorious 01M transmission problem on my vw jetta. It sticks in gear and wont upshift. this lucas product made the problem worse even after the trans ecu was reset. I have to say that lucas makes fine products and it seems that it is just in this case that it wont help at all.
2,did not work to stop transmission leak,We tried this fix for a our rebuilt transmission leak.It did not work and it is still dripping.Lucas 10009 Transmission Fix 24 oz.was the recommended fix.
2,Did not fix my leak,"I bought this stuff for my 1947 Willys Jeep. The transfer case/transmission has developed a nasty leak recently, and I hoped this product would help. I added a full bottle to the transfer case (which was leaking the most) and a bit to the transmission sump; they are interconnected, but have separate fill and drain holes. It was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff (about the consistency of molasses). I drove around today, about 40 miles or so, and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when I put it in. I cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission."
5,Works great on new and old transmissions!,"I purchased this product, after it was recommended to me. I used it in my 99 ford escort, after I had the fluid, filter and a flush done two times. The product worked immediately. Every shift is silky smooth and quick now. I also used this in my mothers new, 2010 ford fusion 4cyl. It had an issue with shifting too slow and kicking into certain gears. Now it shifts fast and smooth. No more kicks. I'd recommend this to anyone."
5,Not a full fix but it gets the job done,"Transmission was leaking and became damaged before I found out the fluid was low. Lucas transmission fix solved the leak and *helped* restore normal shifting (about 50% better). One caveat though: follow the instructions and use the full amount (full bottle for normal car, half for a subcompact like my Ford Escort ZX2). Initially I wasn't patient enough to wait the 20 minutes needed to suck in the complete amount, and it didn't help until I bit the bullet and fed in the full quantity."
3,Salsa Music on the devine,"Very nice music, the salsa songs are good and enjoyable and the price is outstanding! You can't beat the price in any manner. I recommend purchasing your music used, they are well kept, great prices and if you take care of them and are no longer interested keeping them, then sell them on. But, as for me I am building up a library to beat all others."
4,Why the dissing?,"I have been a fan of this band ever since I heard ""Blood and Roses"", and ran out and bought vinyl the next day. I have every one of their albums but the last, having bought ""Date"" maybe 2 years ago in the cutouts.I'm not sure why everyone is so down on this album. The only bad thing I can say is that several of the songs sound very similar to each other - so OK, Pat's imagination was a little (...) during this period. But a couple songs really stand out. ""Gotti"" is a great rock tune, while I think ""Afternoon Tea"" is perhaps now my favorite Smithereens song. (I happen to think their mellow stuff is underrated - I think they stand among my favorites from this band).This is not a terrific collection, but it DID whet my appetite for more, rather than convince me the band is dead. Of course, the 6 years of silence had me worried. Now I've gotta go out and get their most recent."
3,Less than the sum of its parts,"Date With The Smithereens reunited the band with engineer Don Dixon, who was responsible for the band's two best albums (Especially For You and Green Thoughts). The band is back to sounding its best, and there are some good songs here. Unfortunately, the album doesn't really come together; too many of the songs sound too much alike, largely because of the similar tempos. Think of the chugging beat of Blood and Roses applied to every song, and you have the overall impression that this album gives the listener. It's not really QUITE like that, but somehow it ends up feeling that way.Two editions of Date With The Smithereens were issued; the CD, and a boxed set of 7"" 45rpm records with two songs on each side. The 45rpm version features different mixes of the songs than the CD, so serious Smithereens fans will want to have both versions."
1,Title Not Accurate,"My copy did not contain the Edinburgh Lectures. However, I didn't realize this until weeks after I had bought the book."
1,Incredibly Dull,If you wish to further your studies with the secret don't buy this book.It was so incredibly dry that I could not finish it.Instead try the Master Key System by Charles Hannel or The works of walace wattles which I found thosannds of times more thought provoking.I don't know what thesre people read but I could'nt get through it at all.I'm not dumb.I just have a hunger for more after reading the secret.I enjoyed the afore mentioned works immensley however this just did'nt get it for me.
3,Too Many Park Photos...Not Enough Lodge Photos,"I thought this book was going to be all about the lodges, with lots and lots of pictures of how they looked today.But this book is 1/3 about the national parks, 1/3 about the history of the lodges, and 1/3 about the lodges today. If that is what you are looking for, then you will probably be happy with this book.If, on the other hand, you want a book packed with lots of present day pictures of the lodges, you might be a little disappointed.I already have books about the national parks and the scenery, so I wasn't looking for more of that. And I don't really care about who did what at the lodges back in 1940 or 1950 or whenever. I just wanted lots of pictures of how these beautiful buildings look today. There are a few nice color pictures of each lodge but not as many pictures of the lodges in their present state as you would think a nearly 200 page book would have."
1,Another K-Tel Ripp-Off of New Studio Recordings!,"Be warned that this is NOT a budget CD of ""Greatest Hits"" but a collection of NEW STUDIO RECORDINGS. If you want the original hit recordings it's best to look elsewhere."
4,Happy with product,"I have been using Derm Cpas with my 2 labs for about 8 months now. My male had dry flaky skin at the begining of the cool weather and after a recent bath. I started the Derm Caps to give them both a better coat & to hopefully reduce shedding.Duke's coat (as well as Sadie's) is georgeous! They had a good start, but now it's better & we get compliments ALL the time. Duke's dry skin is mainly gone, there's occasional dryness after a bath. As for the shedding, it's a natural thing, we won't ever stop it. But I think it's been slightly reduced."
2,wrong dosage,"I ordered this item for my 22 lb. cocker. When I recieved it, the directions said that it was for a 50-70 lb. dog. The company did send the correct dosage, but the ad stayed the same."
4,"Great fun, but paint fading!","Great fun in the pool, but the paint is already dull from the sun. We've been using it for just a few months now."
3,It's a duck chlorine feeder,"Little pricey for what ya get, I have had mine for about 6 months now and the plastic body still seems to be ok. However my duck is off-balance and floats on it's side, it's been like this since purchase and pretty sure it's a defect in the cast/mold process when they manufactured it. Still, it does dispense chlorine just fine and that's really all that I care about."
5,chori-duck mallard chlorine despenser,it keep the chlorine out of the water keep it from turnning green. when that breaks or wear out i will buy a other.
3,GreatLooking ducks!,"So glad I could still find the Mallards!! And they have improved the dispenser cups. My two ducks had finally worn out, after replacing the original design dispensers a couple times. Thanks to Amazon to have them at a reasonable replacement.Jan.2013 update. I'm really getting tired of replacing these. But I like the looks. The duck top wears holes through the top. Must hit and wear against the overhang rocks. Also harder to screw dispenser than original models sold at Leslies. I just keep buying them though. Now on my 7th or 8th!! (in about 12 years--but 4 in last 3 years)"
2,Floating duck,"Would not recommend this duck for your hot tub. Rides high in water, turns over. Really a west of money"
3,moderate product,"I bought this blow dryer based on the reviews and am moderately pleased with it. Right away I noticed how heavy this dryer is and the first few times I used it, my hands would slip up and I would accidentally press down the blue button at the top (for cold air). This was going on for a week before I realized that it wasn't the hair dryer going bad but it was my hand hitting the button. I also would not agree that this hair dryer ""blow drys my hair faster"" like some of the other reviews simply because the heat doesn't get hot.. more like luke-warm air (which isn't always a bad thing!). Overall, my most favorite part of this blow dryer is the color- it's beautiful. If you have previously used a heavy blow dryer and don't use really hot air to blow dry your hair then this product would be great for you."
1,Broke completely,"This product was fine-while it worked. After about three months it just stopped working suddenly. It doesn't even turn on now. Don't buy it, it is a piece of trash."
4,"good value, relatively quiet, easy to ""store"" upright","I agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a powerful, inexpensive, relatively quiet unit with an easily cleaned filter, and - important for me - a flat air intake so I can easily set it aside on the bathroom counter standing on its end. It takes up a minimum of room that way.All of these inexpensive units are cheaply made and there is always the chance, expressed by some reviewers, that they will fail early. My experience with two of them is that they both have lasted over a year."
2,Save Your Money,"There are at least four books on camping in Washington state, and I'd suggest to potential customers that this is not the best. So if you are only going to buy one, don't make it this one.Generally, there are too many errors in fact in this book. It is as if the writer spent more time reading other camping books, then wrote the book without visiting all of the places in the guide.Before buying this book, glance at the other books on camping in Washington. You'll see why this isn't the best buy."
2,No ratings or favorites,I don't think the writer actually visited many of the places because there was little guidance about pros and cons of the different campgrounds. Some kind of rating scale would have been nice.
1,Full of Features... When It Doesn't Skip...,"I've had this DVD player for more than a year now. So far, I've been pretty happy with it as far as its features and etc. for its price range. But it still doesn't make up for all the skipping that it likes to do - with old and BRAND NEW DVDs!!! Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes it would just skip around for no apparent reason. I'm yet to figure out why. I'm going to replace this with a PS2. This model was one of Samsung's earliest DVD players and that might be why it skips so much. Maybe there was some bug that they hadn't taken care of. Normally I'm extremely happy with Samsung's products but this one surely changed my mind about Samsung. If you're considering a budget DVD player with a choke full of features, you can't beat this one - if you can stand all the skipping, that is. For the love of God, don't buy this model."
2,Not really worth buying.,"This DVD player claims to be able to play VCDs (Video CDs), but it does not support CDRs, and so that feature is relatively worthless.My main problem with this DVD player is that at least once in every movie, I notice some kind of glitch. The more common glitch is just skipped frames or a quick frame pause. The other glitch (which is much more annoying) is random colored pixels dumped all over the screen.This player is cheap, but you really get what you pay for. Spend the extra (money) and get a real player."
2,Very Disappointed,"Samsung receives low marks for quality on this product. The first one I received was defective- the DVD tray would not open. The replacement I received squeals during DVD operation. Although this was a low end purchase, I expected minimal standards to be met. Also the remote design is not particular user friendly- 2 stars is generous"
2,AUDIO BUT NO VIDEO,"I THOUGHT THIS DVD WAS A GOOD DEAL WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND IT PLAYED CD'S FINE. HOWEVER, THE VIDEO DID NOT WORK ON THIS PLAYER, SO I COULD NOT PLAY DVD'S. IT HAD TO BE RETURNED."
5,Class Dvd player,"What can i say about this player but just pure class i have this system six months now and never had a days trouble. I have tons of movies on this player and they have been all perfect some even with bad scratches on them, and the price well what can i say if you are thinking of buying the samsung dvd 511 look no more this player is tops 5 stars."
1,let's just call it skippy,The picture and on-line menu features are great but it skipped so much I had to return it in 3 weeks. It actually skipped 10 minute segments of the movie. At first I thought it was a bad scene transition in the movie. The only way I could see some of the missed scenes is by rewinding over the skipped section.
2,I returned this item!,"This was my first DVD player and I was immediately impressed by the exceptional quality of the audio and video. However, I noticed that it skipped on my first new DVD. After getting several other new DVDs, I found it skipped on all of them as well. I returned this item and ultimately got a Panasonic DVD Player which does not skip at all."
2,I loved it AT FIRST.....,But I've had this player for only 6 months now and every single movie skips. I'm taking mine back tomorrow and getting a different make and model.
2,problems too,"I too have had problems with the DVD-511. I have noticed it skipping at least once during each and every movie that I have played, sometimes worse than others. Other than that, it is a great machine. I am planning to take it back to the store I got it at and try another unit of the same model. If that doesn't make a difference, I will be getting an entirely different model."
3,Skipped. Fixed. Skipped again.,"First off this is my first DVD player. It was a Christmas present in 2000. Within days I had the skip/distortion/freeze up problems like I see so many others have had. After about 3 months I took it to be repaired. The laser was replaced. Fine..that was on Samsung. Now about 3 months later it has started again. It started about 2 weeks ago when I rented ""Unbreakable."" It would not load. I noticed scratches on the disc. Okay..I rented another one. Same thing. Now I am getting distortion on DVDs that I own that played all the way without a blip the first two or three times. So in a nutshell you could get one that works properly, but you may get a bad one. I do not play DVDs constantly. Maybe one or two a week, so overuse is not a problem. I think'll need to lay out some extra $$$ for a quality DVD player. When it works the picture is great, the sound is great. It has features that I would never use. Plus, it is short enough to fit in the space above my VCR."
3,"An OK player, but it has its flaws...","I bought this player because it looked like a good deal, and I don't have a big sound system or a new TV, so I didn't need any special features. But I didn't expect that it would skip on every DVD I've ever played! It can get very annoying when your movie suddenly skips in the middle of the most exciting scene. Here are some Pros & Cons:PROS:- Nice 3X Zoom Feature- Clear picture- Automatically turns onto screensaver when you pause for more than a minute, to avoid burnout.CONS:- Has skipped on every DVD I have played on it, sometimes more than once.I recommend buying a better quality player, because after the first few skips you'll wish you had.If you think that the skipping wouldn't bother you, and you want the low price, then go for it- besides the skipping this player has pretty good sound & graphics."
2,skip-tastic,"worked well for about 4 months - then went into skip-mode, even on brand new discs. won't play cd-r's, and often won't read regular cd's.very frustrating player."
1,Brokenhearted,"It's really quite simple. Don't waste your time, energy or emotional distress on this player. This was my first experience with a DVD player. God, I hope it gets better than this. It will not play. Brand new disks, proper hook up, and absolutely NO SUPPORT!!! I bought this thinking that a product with a warranty of a year instead of 90 days must be a better product. So much for that theory."
5,good buy,"i recently bought one of these, and i haven't had any problems at all. the features are great, and i'd reccomend one to anyone looking to buy an inexpensive dvd player"
1,STAY AWAY!,"JUST STAY AWAY OF IT! DVD511 IS GREAT ON THE FIRST HALF OF MOVIES BUT AFTER A 1 OR 1,5 HOURS LATER IT ALWAYS SKIPS AND FREEZES! I SENT IT 4-5 TIMES BACK AND SPEND [$$$] TO FIX BUT THEY COULDN'T!!! THIS WAS MY FIRST SAMSUNG PRODUCT AND NOW I HATE SAMSUNG! BELIEVE ME; FOREVER ""SONY""!"
3,DVD BRILL!!! VCD on CDR brittle,"From what I've seen of this player, it plays DVD's crystal clear with very few problems. For a real DVD buff then this may be the player for you. However, for people who also burn their own VCDs there is the drawback that you will have fun trying to play VCD's burnt onto CDR, which IMHO is not good. The major factor with VCD's is that you can encode your home movies to VCD/SVCD. This player only plays a few brands of CDR (proabably the ones that appear to it as normal CD's, I don't know enough about the technology to elaborate). Backing up your DVD's to VCD is a bit overkill perhaps but if you want to burn home movies to CDR then you'll probably be out of luck with this one unless you can find a particular brand that it likes."
4,the world is not enough,The graphics were great and my family loved it. The sound was incredible. It was the best dvd players I have ever used.
2,Spend your money elsewhere...,"I recently purchased this player at a store and was disappointed to find that not only did the frames skip on not 1, 2, or even 3 DVD's but every SINGLE DVD I had (over 40) - so I brought the player back and was given a new model but a month later I started experiencing unexpected power losses within the unit. I normally associate Samsung with lower end Electronic units and after this experience I will continue. I purchased a Panasonic DVDA115 which I am completely happy with and would suggest to anybody that's ready to make the jump from VHS to DVD."
1,"BAD product / BAD support / BAD BAD, BAD","Ever want a DVD player that looks nice on the shelf but doesn't fuction? Well this is would be the unit for you. Samsung must have stayed up nights working on the bugs in this machine; Creating them that is. Half the movies skip, freeze-up, or just flat out never start playing. I called Samsung and they acknowledged the problem and basicly said ""Goodby and Good luck, you're on your own."" This was after weeks of tring to get hold of a real person. This player has got to be the worst on the market and support is non-existent. If you buy it, you may as well throw your cash away. I went with Sony and am very happy. You may choose another brand but please, for you own sanity, FEAR Samsung."
4,Excellent for study of historical theolgoy,"McGrath is a leading scholar in our day, and this book shows why. While obviously very informed in his area of study, his writing is alive and easily accessible to the reader just wading into the study of historical theology. There are excerpts of original writings from different issues in church history, all of which are framed by McGrath's helful explanation, summary, and commentary. Definitely worth having."
4,Wasn't required for class,Read it because I'm interested in Theology. Very comprehensive. The companion reader is 5 stars.
4,"Good CD, But...",...some of the Gaither Vocal Bands' songs are too hip for my tastes.Come on Bill...quit with the contemporary (I call them contemptible myself) songs!
2,"Great place to start for ideas, But...","This book offers a very extraordinary group of ideas in the form of sketches, however that is as far as you will get with the 101 projects you can build yourself. Each project has a plan number that requires the speculative do-it-yourselfer to spend 20 to 85 dollars on a blueprint that most profesional builders won't even touch. In summary, the plans are too complicated for the weekend warrior, and the materials needed to build these elaberate structures will blow any do-it-your-selfers budget. You can get some good ideas from this book, but that is it."
1,Catalog of plans for sale,"This book is basically a list of plans for sale by the Hanley Wood Company. Most of the designs look rather dated to me, I would guess many of these were designed in the 1960's and 70's. I didn't find any particularly interesting or useful ideas here, most designs were either very simple or much too ornate & contrived for my taste. It's rather misleading to call this a ""book"" and say it was ""wriitten by"" and author, it is really more of a large sales brochure dressed up as a paperback book."
4,Trident Tanto,This is one of the best knives I've ever owned. It's very well built and extremely light weight. The built in cord cutter is a nice feature. Works great for removing the string from hay bales. This is now my edc knife. I will definately be buying more sog products in the future.UPDATE:After only a month of use the factory edge got to the point where it could no longer be sharpened. I had to reset the edge with my wet stone because they dont't use a good grind for the factory edge. Still a great knife for the money. Just be prepared to spend some quality time with a stone to get a propper edge on it.
4,SOG Trident Tanto Black TiNi,"I would like to have a bit of the blade serrated (which is available, but only at full price), but this is still an incredible piece. extremely tough, versatile, light, balanced and very smooth/fast opening mechanics. i got it at half the msrp, but would still be happy paying full price. looking into some other SOG products now."
4,Great knife...,"This is a very well built knife, the only complaint that I have is that the placement of the rope cutter catches on my pocket almost every time I put it away. It has not cut my pocket yet, however I will not be surprised if that eventually occurs."
5,Sweet knife,I bought this on the recommendation of someone else. I was looking for a good all around lock-blade knife. What a great purchase. The knife is surprisingly light and strong--must be those new-fangled materials. I love the tanto blade. I've had knives with that blade in the past. You can punch through a steel drum with that type of blade--not recommended.
5,Pure Quality,This knife is top quality like most all SOG products. The open assist really works well like it claims. The blade comes sharp and is easy to maintain with little effort.
5,Fantastic knife!,"I bought my SOG trident tanto a little over a year and half ago, and since then its seen some heavy use. The Trident has stood up to the abuse with no problems whatsoever, the edge and finish have both held up through all sorts of various uses, from cutting rope to cutting wood. Even the assisted opening hasnt aged a day. This knife is fantastic and has served me well."
5,I really love this knife!,This is a great knife. The low profile clip allows me to carry the knife in my pocket without any unsightly bulges or need a case like my last knife. The assisted open feature is so nice. There is no fumbling around when I need it opened. Nice sharp blade too. Great knife. Great value. Just great!
4,Sturdier and Faster Assist-Open than my Kershaw - Light Enough for Dress Pants,"This is a really well made knife. It's sharp as all get out, has a nice thick tanto blade, it is as sturdy as my Eagle, and the assist open is faster than my Kershaw, and my Kershaw is fast. For a business person who needs a neat concealable silent option to occompany my CHL as well as a durable blade for a dad, an outdoorsman, and motorcyclist, this is the right tool.My only complaint is the price. I guess you're going to pay for a good knife, but a real feat of engineering would be being able to produce and sell this knife at $30 instead of $60. I guess I'd say the same about my Eagle and my Kershaw tooSOG Specialty Knives & Tools TF-7 Trident Tanto, Black TiNi[...]"
5,I love it.,"I've had this knife for about 9 months now. It is my EDC knife. It's light, discreet and stays put in whichever pocket you choose. It is also impressive upon presentation. Highly recommended, worth the investment."
4,SOG Trident Tanto,"This knife is bad-ass! Feels good in the hand, and has a nice spring assist. Not quite as smooth as a kershaw spring assist, but more heavy duty. It is not flat black like I thought, but looks good and has a nice finish.I thought it was kind of cheap and light at first glance, but then realized that the plastic handle is extremely durable and easy to hold. It comes very sharp out of the package, and was packed nicely in a box(that could hold 20 of them) The wire/string cutter is not to great... fishing line is about all you will cut with it. I thought I had broken it after cutting melons and throwing it into the dirt a few times (not how I usually treat my knives) but I just rinsed with hot water and re-oiled the blade and was back to brand new! But after about a month of hard use and in this case a lot of abuse, it is still going strong! Awesome knife!"
5,TF-7,This knife rocks. It comes out of the box sharper than you'll ever need. The spring assists works faster than any other knife i've had.
5,Well worth the money,Great knife super strong and golds a great edge. Run it over a stone once or twice and it is razor sharp again and stays that way.
5,Size? Not so great. Quality? Fantastic.,"For some reason I thought this knife would be a little bit smaller, even though I read the dimensions and all. The size came as somewhat of a surprise.However, just out of the box, the knife seems to handle well and feel very sturdy. There was hardly any side to side play, and I'll sharpen the knife here in a bit, but overall, I'm impressed. I don't think I'll use this knife as an EDC knife. Instead, I'll probably just use it as a fishing/outdoor knife. Because of its size, it would fit perfectly in a cargo pocket, but it is a little long for a regular side pocket. However, it is quite light, so it's not a pain to carry around weight-wise."
1,High Failure rate,I have purchased three of the DWL-2700AP. Out of the three I have bought 1 failed within 6 months and Dlink replaced it. Another one failed after 18 months and I am out of luck ( 1 yr warrenty). I am currently using the other two but WHEN one of them fail I WILL replace them with a different manufacturer's AP bridge. They are not worth the high price DLink charges for them.
3,wireless cameras,We have found the distance is pretty good on the dlink. But we also found that mulitiple cameras pulls too much traffic thru it causes it to take errors. overall pretty good
3,A world is saved but our characters don't grow much more,"While I enjoyed the first two books in this series, I would have to say that this volume was a disappointment to me. The mystery behind the Gardier aggression, the fate of Arisilde and the future of Tremaine's and Ilias relationship is resolved in this novel, but despite that I ended the book feeling dissatisfied.The pace of this book seemed more uneven and slower than the previous two novels, and at the end of it, while the war is finished, and Tremaine is no longer suicidal, I didn't feel like I had a real insight to Tremaine's character aside from some nasty episodes in her past that made her feel that society wasn't ""worth it"". On reflection this is a series I should have bought in paperback given my feeling of let down at the end, but it had some unique moments, especially in book 2 on ""the Ravenna""."
5,Great flashlight!,"Wow! This was better than I expected. It's quite durable, very small (2""), sleek, and super bright! It even comes with a clip that prevents the button from being pressed when the user does not want it to be. One aspect I didn't expect but really liked was that the light is green."
1,Doesn't seem strong enough,I have been using a 10% Glycolic Pad from another company. I've been very happy with that product but felt I needed something a little stronger.I purchased the Glycolix Treatment Pads in 15% and 20%. I figured I would build a tolerance to the 15 so I also purchased the 20.The first time I used the 15% I felt nothing. The next day I tried the 20% pads. I felt a very slight tingling sensation. Hardly noticeable.Tonight I tried my old 10% pads. I can still feel like they are working. They give that burn / tingling feeling.I'm not sure if you have to feel that tingling for the product to be working or not. I would think yes.Someone else wrote that these pads are a knock off of the real thing.At this point I can not recommend this product. I will still continue to try this product since I already have it.If my opinion changes I will post it here.
5,"Humorous, Ironic, Revealing","Viktor Suvorov, the nom de plume of a high-ranking Soviet military intelligence officer who defected to the West, has a great style and senses of humor and irony. All of these are shown in full force in this autobiographical tale of his entry into the Red Army officer corps as a tanker. A must-read for anyone into Cold War military history or anyone who's ever been in any military; many others will find it good, too. The title, which actually has ""Liberators"" in quotes, is a masterpiece of subtle irony, as Suvorov describes to you his growing understanding that he and his Red Army comrades were not Liberators of eastern Europe, but rather a conquering, occupying force. Well worth the reader's time."
3,REDS MEETS THE STING,"diane keaton plays a crusading reporter, like she did in REDS, though here it's for laughs.keaton and cann reuinited from THE GODFATHER; this movie looks more expensive than THE GODFATHER.cann and eliot goulde in a THE STING type movie, with ted cassidy showing up from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (and THE ADDAMS FAMILY).and michael caine is a gangster who runs the jail he's put in---akin to GOODFELLAS."
2,Not as good as his Age of Innocence,"Be warned: unlike The Age of Innocence, two-thirds of this book consists of landscapes. If it's sea and clouds you want (with no humans in the picture), buy this. If it's beautiful girls you want, get his other books."
1,How to make a boring picture,"Pretty amazing -- David Hamilton takes some pictures of some very attractive subjects, in extremely attractive backgrounds, with extremely expensive equipment, and manages to make them look worse than the worst of my holiday photos. Boring, self-conscious... basically, not worth a look. If you like the subject matter, I highly recommend Jock Sturges (for some very laid-back, pretty pictures) or Sally Mann (for some slightly more disturbing overtones.) But skip Hamilton, he's a waste of paper"
5,This book sings!,"From the subway that ""smoothed into the station"" to all the exotic Japanese meals, this fantasy trip of two kids to Japan is just inspiring. I find myself as delighted and laughing as my kids. Having falling totally in love with Ms. Kalman's words and images I'm off in search of more!"
5,Fits perfectly,This is the only book that is helping me to understand that I am not going crazy. There are reasons for feeling the way that I do. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in therapy or feels that they too are all alone.
5,Grandma's on the Go,"A very informative compilation of camping/RV-ing tips learned on the road, mixed in with incredible stories of how this single mom involved her many children in active learning experiences on the road all over North America. She is an inspiration for other women who may lack her kind of guts to venture out of her comfort zone with common sense, a strong faith in God, and an insatiable drive for exploration. Having shared some time with the author in a camp setting in Alaska, I have learned much from her wealth of experiences first hand and vicariously through this book."
2,Too cheesey for its own good,"I like these kind of movies and I like Michael Rooker, but this one fails miserably. With little or no explanation to the hokey 'monster', you spend the entire time not understanding how it exists, how Rooker came to the lake his whole life and never saw it, why it waited until it was stuck under the ice before hunting humans, why it wounds first or sometimes kills, why why why....Sure, some creative license is understood in a low budget horror flick, but this one just goes to far - wait until the ending if you are not convinced I am correct. You reach a point of not caring about the characters or whether this creature lives on to kill another day. Dare I mention that the creature is a modern ripoff of the Creature from the Black Lagoon..."
5,Hypothermia rocks!!!,"Being a big time horror fan and a diehard collector I love this movie alot, the acting and special effects were right on point.You encounter a lake monster in the dead winter was a brilliant idea and concept, the monster effects was hands down freaking awesome and unique. Hypothermia is a downright horror/science fiction monster you must have in your collection of monster films. Having this film in my horror collection is truly a honor, hats off to MPI Media Group, Glass Eye Pix and Dark Sky Films for bringing and distributing this film to horror fans like myself who live and breathe horror films. Hypothermia gets 2 thumps, a perfection 10 and 5 stars...HYPOTHERMIA KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE GENRE OF MONSTER/HORROR FILMS:)"
4,Visually Masterful Underground Cinema,"Visually masterful underground cinema. The bleak, but beautiful setting of the frozen lake is warped by a minimalistic luciferian score. The pacing is hypnotic, at times slow, but meditative.I enjoyed the plot, which was a tongue-in-cheek combination of fishing, family drama, and horror. It was a weird mix of exactly what you'd expect and complete ridiculousness. It could use some more tits and more gore, but maybe that will happen in part 2.The acting is b-movie camp outside of Michael Rooker and Amy Chang. You've got to listen closely to grab some of the bizarre stuff the characters say with straight faces.It seems that swimming below the traditional genre flourishes there is a subversive social message. I definitely didn't watch it for the relevant message, but instead enjoyed it for the eerie tension and creepiness.This is my favorite McKenney film with Automatons trailing close behind it."
2,SILLIEST LOOKING MONSTER IN YEARS,"HYPOTHERMIA is one of those ""creature features"" that would have been more successful had the film gone more humorous or campy. Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver's suit!Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes. Blood and gore are utilized but tame compared to current standards. At only 73 minutes, HYPOTHERMIA passes quickly, so it might work as a double bill on Halloween!"
3,An interesting low budget attempt,"First off, I liked the monster. He has a few genuine jump scares and he looks cool running at the camera when he's lit with flashlights at night. Michael Rooker seemed very restrained in his actions, almost sedated. People who know his as ""Merle"" from The Walking Dead would be surprised to see how he behaves here. Not a bad movie at all, shot at an interesting location. I would have liked a little bit more history about the monster, like a scene where the characters sit around and tell stories of local sightings or disappearances, or maybe a flying saucer that takes off at the end."
1,Interesting,I was ok with this movie until they revealed the monster. I was also confused about when they got bit. Did that mean they changed into the monster? They never went into that. This was a strange movie
2,Hypothermia,"It was a so so movie,sort of suspenseful,right up to the point where we see that stupid looking 1960's ""monster"",really."

2,Don't believe the hype.,"I'm a big fan of Ching Ying Lam.but was unhappy with this film. It was boring and really slow in so many parts. The humor seemed forced to me and I didn't really care for either of the side kicks at all. I'm trying hard to think of something I like about this movie,but can't. Very inferior to mr vampire."
2,bad nursing pad,I would not recomment this pad. I usually wake up during the night and the milk already soaked my bra even though it is thicker than others. Don't buy it.
3,There was another aerial photo book...,A correction to previous reviews. There was another book with excellent aerials of Paris...actually of many parts of Europe.The book: Europe: An Aerial Closeup by Charles E. Rotkin. pub. 1962 by Bonanza Books a coffee table format. Very good work. I worked with this photographer on several annual reports and he gave me my copy. Would recommend you check it out.
5,Moved Me,"Sam Cooke have paved the way for other artists.Sam didn't do it alone and that's the beauty of this book,because it focus on Sam Cooke's life but also recognize other artists in that era as well. I love this book."
3,Looking for Mr. Cooke,Not as insightful as I hoped. Ealry history is good. No real answers and puts nicks in Sam Cooke's character. I will read other accounts to try and get a more complete picture.
3,Thorough but not interesting.,"I read lots of biographies and I love Sam Cooke. But this biography was rather boring and I skipped through a lot of it because I was not interested in exactly how he entered the music business and the ""in's and out's"" of music publishing. I wanted more but it wasn't there."
4,Descriptive yet breezy look at ill-fated pop star,"A well written summary of the pop star Sam Cooke's rise from the Chicago gospel scene to pop music stardom. The story moves quickly while the author provides great detail on the music and the genius behind it (and proves the tale about Sonny Bono being hired ""on the spot"" during a Specialty recording session!). For fans and those interested in gospel and pop origins, this book is a must."
4,Building the Perfect PC,"Excellent primer for the first time builder, if he/she has a basic understanding of computer components. Authors cover building good, solid systems for almost every need a user might have. Would recommend highly to the first time builder."
3,Not bad,"Unfortunately this book came in a little late in the build process of my latest PC to be of any signifigant help, it does appear to have been well written and straightforward. From what I have read thus far, I think it was still worth the purchase and I'd recomend it to someone looking to build a PC vice buying a factory cookie cutter machine, especially if this is their first time. Overall, not a bad book."
5,Great Guide!,I Love the approach taken here. Gives a strong direction in a broad array of products and circumstances. A lot of savvy information for the casual as well as advanced builders.
5,Even Better Than the Title Suggests,"Well written book. I do wish it had some ""manual type"" illustrations instead of or in addition to the few photos. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's easy to understand without getting too technical. Anyone who is advanced enough to want more high tech language probably wouldn't buy a book like this anyway. I really liked the fact that the authors give their professional recommendations on components, brands and parts. Even if you have no plans on building a PC this is still a great book to have for anyone that owns a computer. If you understand how things go together and work it will be much easier diagnosing problems, fixing or upgrading your PC. The chapters cover each logical PC application from budget home computer to media center to server. (I wish they had a chapter on building a Hackintosh but I understand why they don't :)"
3,Not What I Expected...,"Although I've heard a lot of good things about this classic, I didn't find it as enjoyable as I had hoped. It wasn't, in my opinion, well-written. With the summary in the beginning and all of a sudden more details added as a sort of afterthought in the middle, it just didn't sit well with me. There were a few suspensefull moments and I did get caught up in some of the commotion. However, I don't think I would ever consider this a ""reading for fun"" book."
3,robinson crusoe,"I thorougly enjoyed this novel ,not only for the good story ,but also for the life lessons learned through Robinson. Crusoe must figure out how to get by and thrive with no hope of rescue,he must learn how to change his priorities ,and his outlook on life,and faced with new challenges,he must learn how to adapt.Robinson Crusoe details the career of an errant youth who discovers hope and faith through experimentation.Robinson Crusoe is a true literary classic,and as such deserves the attention of all serious literatures. I highly recommend all ages to read this classic bok."
4,This Book Intriqued me!,"I especially liked this book because of the adventure and since it is a classic, and not such a bad book after all, I gave it 5 stars. But then I took one away because it was hard for me to follow. I recommend you at least try to understand this book. Happy Reading! :)"
1,Yuck!,I don't care I don't know I didn't read it but it is an old fogey book it is boring who wrote it what is it called again oh sorry i didn't mean what i put there i meant that it is an old fogey book it is boring who wrote it what is it called aaagh i died
1,BORING,"This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like ""Barney Goes to the Zoo"". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed."
4,Quite an interesting book,"Robinson Crusoe is the tale of a man stranded on a deserted island. Daniel Defoe's creativity makes the novel fascinating to read. Robinson Crusoe is always discovering new things about the island and inventing new gadgets. This element of the book almost makes the reader want be on a stranded island too. Robinson Crusoe struggles to remain civilized and saves the equipment from the shipwreck. He builds a pen for his goats and dries grapes to turn into raisins. In these ways he starts his own little civilization to survive. One day Robinson finds a fresh human footprint in the sand on the beach, which means that other humans are on his island! This is the beginning of the adventure Robinson will encounter of communicating and working with a completely different human being from a savage and opposite civilization. Will Robinson accept the challenge?"
5,its good,it is not just a boght a man that is trap on a island. but aboght a man that had troble with his father. and so he goes to sea. it is a very good book yes it is dull at times but it was very good
3,A bit of a struggle to get through this book,"I've always wanted to read this book; however, I was somewhat disappointed. There were simply to many parts of the book that dwelled on how to grow raisins, goats, corn, etc. When Robinson did go exploring the island you did find yourself envisioning the beauty of the island and the surrounding waters. I found it overall a bit of a struggle to get through it, but I would recommend to any reader that you finish it."
3,Sole survivor seeks slave,"Robinson Crusoe escapes from slavery himself and (after selling his fellow escapee) sails off to acquire a supply of duty-free slaves. When he is marooned, he spends YEARS figuring out how to acquire a slave for himself on his desert island -- which he does! After a lifetime of religious contemplation, the only regret he has about his slave-trading is that he should've stayed home and just bought them at the market."
2,"A true ""classic"".","What was it Mark Twain said about ""classics""? Anyway. Easy to read...it's not -- written in an alien tongue that only approximates English.Sentences run on for what seem like years. The story itself is 250 pages of torturously slow moving set-up and 25 quick pages of anti-climactic resolution.I haven't seen a story end that fast since Star Trek -- The Next Generation.It almost seems as though Defoe gave up after 250 pages (can't really blame him) and just wanted to end the bloody thing. Inevitably, loose ends abound -- Friday's father??Some things, it seems, are called ""classics"" because they are first to accomplish something(this being the first English adventure novel) and not because of any great merit. A case could be made..."
5,"Beautiful book, but abridged","Scribner has created a beautiful book in this edition. The illustrations are on heavy glossy paper and are magnificent. There are very nice, free readings of this work online, and so I purchased the book for my young children to enjoy - to read while listening to the narrator. My only complaint is the book is abridged. This is not evident from the description. I think most editions of this work are abridged. When the book ended, I was left wondering what became of Friday, as he is not mentioned again after the final battle. The author did not seem like one who would leave out that detail, and so I discovered the unabridged story is longer. Still, the quality of the book and the beauty of the illustrations are so very nice that I cannot knock a star off my review."
3,school report,"For twenty-four years Robinson Crusoe was stranded on an island far away from anything, after being the only survivor of the shipwreck. Until one friday he rescues a prisoner I felt that book moved very slowly through the whole story, but it kept me interested throughout it. He turns his deserted island into a tropical paradise and learns to deal with his surroundings. It was an easy read. He returned to England the eleventh of June, 1687; after thirty-five years of being stranded out at sea. Daniel Defoe made this book made it seem more realistic than fiction, with his very descriptive writing. Overall I liked the book, because it had a good plot."
4,Great book for a weekend,"Robinson Crusoe isn't the most exciting book in the world, but its a great story. You really feel like your on that island and you got shiprecked. I loved reading about his trips back and forth to the boat and also about how he built his home as well. Some of the details were too much, but I thought that added to the overall tone of the book. A man thats all alone..untill... -Anyway, its a good book, and a classic."
5,Not a Children's Classic,"One of the first true 'novels' of its kind, from the 1600s, an incredible work on Western Philosophy from the time of its beginnings.Emer de Vattel (1758) admired the Protestants/Puritans in their fair and equitable settlement of lands in America and their treatment of the indigenous population. Crusoe's reaction to and befriending of the cannibal, Friday, reveals his appreciation of Christ in his life, which he gained from isolation and meditation on the bible.This is a Christian study, giving a remarkable description of the early Mohammadans and Cannibals of the Caribbean.Another element, very impressive, was the level of ethics in giving one's word as to contract and property. Quite remarkable."
3,I'm amazed...,"that I actually finished this novel. It's pacing is slow and uneven and the narrator repeats ideas and themes. The character is interesting, although flawed in character. After his wife dies, he leaves his children in England to be raised by other people while he pursues his adventures all around the world, often in the name of ""Christianity"". I think a true christian would have been less selfish and stayed with his children! He abandons them and runs around the world for the rest of his life. He never even talks about his children after leaving them! Some may point to R. Crusoe as an anti-imperialism novel, but for me, I was more impressed by his crappy parenting. I guess I'm glad I read it. Maybe it's considered a ""classic"" because we can all learn from Robinson."
1,???????,"Obviously a classic. I read the entire thing and I understood the first chapter. It went downhill. If you are not an advanced reader, forget it. If you are, Fine by me."
2,"My dad made me read it, you can guess the rest...","I am not about to debate wether or not this was a well written book, because it was. Obviously. The problem is, the book just kind of drags on. Not until the last two chapters did it seem to pick up. Be cautious going into this book. It's not as exciting as you'd think it would be...what with a man being stuck on an island all by himself n all..."
2,Something we all feel we ought to read.,"As the first English novel ever written, Daniel Defoe's novel is perhaps worth reading merely as something that all cultured people ought to have read. However, the book has few literary merits on its own - it's alternately abrupt and tedious, and has a poor plot. Evidently, authors improved at writing fiction in English over time."
1,very disappointed . . . to say the least,I am a fan of Patricia Routledge but have to say that I was very disappointed in Three Portraits. I had our book club over to review the DVD today and three of the five fell asleep in the middle -- and I was one of them. ZZZZZZZZZZZ! I was not a fan of the one-woman performance. I like her interaction with other actors much better.
5,This video is fantastic for kids!,"Blues Clues has become a staple in our household. Our son is only 2 1/2 years old, but he has learned more words, numbers and songs from this great series from Nickelodeon. I highly recommend this and other Blues Clues home videos, as well as books and games that are available."
2,Saw This Six Times Last Week!,I saw this six times last week with my 2 year old nephew. He really loves this and wants to watch this more than anything else. I don't get the appeal of Steve and Blue doesn't seem to appear much in the video. This video is valuable only for teaching dancing and movement but does not seem to have much more content than that. Sesame Street and Veggie Tales succeed much more than Blue's Clues does.
1,After the EIGHTH Viewing.....,Blue and Steve are losing their impact after I've watched this eight times with my nephew.
1,Blue's Birthday video,"I purchased several used ""Blue's Clues"" VHS VCR tapes from different sellers who all listed them as ""used--very good"". All but this one were like new. This tape came in a ""very used"" box and the tape wasn't even re-wound. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller again. His/her description of the product is far from accurate!"
4,SOE F-Section in Action,"SOE F-Section in ActionBruce Marshall's book ""The White Rabbit"" is the factual account of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) missions of Wing Commander F.F.E Yeo-Thomas in France. Yeo-Thomas was a member of RF-Section of SOE, the French section that worked closely with General de Gaulle's Bureau Central de Renseignments et d'Action (BCRA). The book provides some details on the operational and political problems experienced in collaboration with the French in London and with the French Resistance. The author dwells on some of the gruesome aspects of Yeo-Thomas's capture and imprisonment. Overall this book provides some good insight to SOE operations in WWII."
4,No more PING,"I have a highly modified, high compression HD, that still manages to ping at high RPM's with 93 octane. After 1/3 of a bottle in 5 gals, it seems to be running quite a bit quieter. I still may need to retard the timing, but this octane boost definitely helped."
1,This stuff works -- but with significant drawback,"This product uses MMT (Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl) to raise the octane, which is bad news for any car with a catalytic converter. During combustion, the manganese is liberated from the compound. This manganese vapor is then deposited on your spark plugs and in the fine mesh structure of your catalytic converter. The deposits in the catalytic converter can significantly obstruct exhaust flow and impede the ability of the cat to do its job wrt NOx emissions.That's unfortunate, since I've tried a variety of other (cheaper) brands and store-brands of octane booster, without much improvement -- but this stuff actually works."
3,They are OK. Could not find locally and the price was right.,Could not find locally and the price was right. They are OK.I used these to tear apart hard drives.
4,Affordable bits to maintain your folding EDC knife,I bought these to maintain and disassemble my collection of folding knives. Great for taking apart the knife to clean it or to add or remove a pocket clip without breaking the bank. It's not a high quality US made tool but it does the trick.
5,compact and useful,"I wanted to open my laptop and blow out the dust, but of course I didn't know what size torx bit I needed. So I ordered this set, which covers a range of small sizes. From tiny to small. It came with a bit holder to use with a 1/4 inch drive ratchet. And the bits and holder all stay together as a small kit, with the plastic carrier provided. It was a good choice, and it includes the exact bit to fit the screws on my laptop."
4,"Great for Xbox 360, except the controller","The bits work well opening the Xbox 360 console and the hard drive (uses the T6). Although, not so well with the controllers since the bit is too thick/short for the two lower screws on the back of the controller."
5,Derm Caps a life saver!,These really do work and buying in quanity is so much cheaper than thru our local vet. I have a black lab and his coat is like mink since taking these.
3,Smooth Move,"I wasn't as impressed with the Chocolate Smooth Move Tea as much as the regular Smooth Move. Have to admit it tasted good, just didn't work as well. Probably wouldn't buy again."
5,It Works!,"I have this tea occasionally before bed and in the morning....Well, let's just say everything comes out okay in the morning. Sometimes I experience a little gas the next day, but nothing major. I love this tea because it is all natural. Unlike other laxatives that are sodium based."
2,outdated,"This book was required material for a course I took this summer. For a seminar style class focused generally on how to maintain a moral compass while practicing law, I thought the majority of the articles within this book to be very out dated. For example, when reading in 2009 about the advancement of african american attorneys in the legal profession, I don't want to read arguments written in 1990 that are based on studies from the 1970's. I suppose that's not the book's fault, but rather a problem with the pairing of this text with that specific class. I will note though that this book is very left-leaning and my more conservative classmates were grinding their teeth through every article."
2,listen to this whole cd before you buy it,i swear this cd sounds like its 1973. it has this weird isaac hayes vibe. if i wanted a 70s funk vibe i'da got a war cd intstead. or kool and the gang. the performances are on. the recording sounds like a bootleg. and the compositions are wack.
3,A lotta heart,"gotta give this guy credit - he tried and did a prety good job, better than most out there."
4,Pope John XXIII,Book srrived in good time. Slightly used but still very worthwhile and is difficult to get as it is out of print.
4,a comedic film by David Lean,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Hobson's Choice is a 1954 film directed by David Lean and stars Charles Laughton in the title role. It is based on a play by Harold Brighouse.The story is about Henry Hobson, a boot maker and town drunk who is quarreling with his daughter over her desire to marry a man who works for her father.I liked the film and thought the humor was very clever.The supplements are as follows: A 1975 BBC documentary on the life of Charles Laughton, a theatrical trailer and audio commentary with Alain Silver and James Ursini, film scholars and David Lean biographers."
5,HOBSONS CHOICE,"This DVD is a classic; it's cinematography, it's acting and the story are all at the peak of a great artistic presentation."
3,Overly Ambitious,"There are great moments here but, on the whole, this does not deserve (or call for) repeated listenings."
5,The Essential Guide to Crossword Puzzles,"Everything you ever wanted to know about crossword puzzles in a single handbook.

1,shameful journalism,"In his centerpiece ""exposure"" -- the oil-for-food program -- Eric Shawn simply ignores the facts. For starters, US government reports document that the biggest chunk of billions going into Saddam's pockets came from oil smuggled outside the UN program through neighboring countries -- and that the White House and Congress not only knew for years this was going on, but authorized special legal exemptions for Turkey and Jordan so the smuggling could continue. Given what Shawn pretends to do, the book is worthless without such material. He is a practitioner of misdirection and blatant propaganda.Shameful stuff. Too bad one star is the minimum rating, this book deserves zero stars."
1,Lies and half-truths,"This book has failed to tell the truth on all aspects. I challenge Eric Shawn to a debate about the so-called Oil for Food ""scandal"", and everything UN. Why does he need to repeat the Fox News talking points rather than do real research. I wasted my money on this book, and would like a refund."
1,Does not deserve even one star,"This book is a summit of biased and illogical interpretation. It builds a case based on hand-picked selection and emphasis, which reduces significantly the fairness of the arguments laid down. The book does meet neither minimal journalistic standards nor reporting ethics. Definitely a waste of time, money and paper."
4,Same 'ole UN,"Mr. Shawn's book did a fair job capturing the UN as it is up to a point in time. Of course the book was published and its form was frozen in time. But the UN is not, it continues. And sad to say it continues much in the way Mr. Shawn discribes. If it were gone tomorrow, I wouldn't miss it. I must agree with Mr. Shawn that the organization it was meant to be, and was even for a while, is gone."
2,A magazine article,I wanted to like this book and I certainly agree with its premise. But this is essentially a puffed-up essay and I must respectfully disagree with earlier reviews suggesting that its coverage of Oil-for-Food is detailed or incisive.
4,Something for everyone,"This collection is a lot of fun and I am looking forward to watching it again with friends. No, not every bit in here is a jem of timeless brilliance, but a broad range of animation styles are represented, and I wish there were more collections like this out there.The second disk I would say is the stronger of the two, with some pieces that REALLY pulled me in... ""Mt. Head"" for one. There are a few weak pieces that go on too long, and don't make the payoff worth the five or so minutes... but overall, definitely worth the ride.The supplemental insert is very informative with animation techniques and insights from the creators. As an animator, I found this particularly valuable."
2,Cool preview,"I watched Bevis and Butthead on dvd and the preview to this show would always play. A beautiful song mixed with vivid, bright animation and it really sold the set for me. Too bad the animation shorts on this set are not as good as the preview. Ive only seen a few of them that are worth watching more then once. An alright set but nothing exciting, like the preview was."
1,"Sadistic, violent, and depressing","Does nobody know how to make entertaining cartoons anymore? This collection was a rip-off of my hard-earned money. I bought it based upon the fact the Mike Judge was behind the selection process. If you like your animation cynical, depressing, and sadistic, then this collection is for you. Myself, I like to smile when I watch cartoons."
2,Tribute to Miss Lee falters,"Miss Evingson's lithe, restrainted, clear voice is a nice listen, but she falters in this tribute to Peggy Lee , who was a perfectionist when it came to just about everything on her recordings. Everything from the song selection to orchestrations seems off on this outing. ""Is that all there is?"" comes across as a plodding hokey reworking of Lee's life long question and it lacks Lee's ambivalence. ""I'm Gonna Go Fishin'"" included here is also out of place and the Peggy-penned ""I Love Being Here with You"" comes complete with a clunky clarinet solo and lacks Lee's easy going sultry styling. Evingson, however, should not be faulted for paying tribute to Miss Lee, though her attempt, while admirable, doesn't measure up."
5,a rich experience,"I recommend this cd whole heartedly to lovers of soul music. This album is a wonderful and exceptional experience. The singing is full of hope.Rick Astley sings himself into the a league of his own. Easily worth a grammy. Any soul singer would be proud to make a record of this calibre.The Ones You Love and title track Body and Soul are very moving gospel songs. How often do you hear white soul gospel. Hopelessly is the most beautiful love song, and the single includes a live version.This album takes a bit of getting used to, but it is a fulfilling an optomistic one worth your listening time."
5,The start of a music revolution!,"What can you say about a classic that started a revolution in popular music? This single went to number 1 on the US singles chart and stayed their for 7 weeks. The flip side also charted, peaking at 23 on the Billboard Top 100. The single would eventually be certified MULTI-PLATINUM by the RIAA. This CD single includes both the original 45 single A and B sides plus an alternate take of Heartbreak Hotel as a bonus. This is a piece of history and a must for any student of rock.Incidentally, this single was re-released in 2006 and hit number 1 again on the Billboard Singles Sales chart 50 years after it did it the first time! Talk about staying power!"
2,Simple,Wasn't that amazing but I have a little trouble in that department. My boyfriend and I bought three different products to try to help but sadly didn't see much results from any of them but least of all this one .But please don't take this to too much heart....if it's easy for you this might be the one but if you're a bit tricky you might want to look elsewhere...
3,Just okay,This is a good beginning product for someone wanting to add a little variety to their romantic life.
5,play it in the car,"I've had this CD for over a year. It's a regular in my car. I came here to buy a copy for a friend for X-mas and was shocked to see no reviews yet. This CD is one of my top ten favorites. It is passionate, intense, and beautiful. Not for everyone though -- it's not the kind of music to work to or have on during dinner. Play it in the car. HIGHLY recommended."
1,Disappointed,"I thought these lights were a good price for the amount of lights. They replaced lights infront of my house that no longer worked. These do charge up and work for about 3 hours and that is it. If they would even make it till 12am, I'd be happy but, not so. A bit disappointing and a waste of money."
1,Why keep doing this?,"I don't know why Amazon keep's doing this. This is listed as a ten-movie set. What movies? Why would I buy this without knowing? Ok, if I had NO movies in my collection, I guess I could start with this one. But, as far as I know I already have all ten... Did I miss something?"
1,FYI -- The Movies Included,"I don't understand why Amazon even bothers to list this item if it isn't going to tell you what movies it includes.I was curious so I looked on another site selling the same product. According to that site, the movies are: ""10 full-length features that focus on the actions and psyche of the classic trained killer character. TARGET OF AN ASSASSIN (1978), KILL OR BE KILLED (1993), TO KILL A STRANGER (1983), ROGUE MALE (1976), INCIDENT ON A DARK STREET STREET (1972), PROJECT KILL! (1977), FUNERAL FOR AN ASSASSIN (1977), KILL CASTRO (1980), MURDER ONCE REMOVED (1971), and KILLING AFFAIR (1986).""I'm not familiar with any of these films and they don't sound very good. By the way, I take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information."
4,Nice!,"""Que Soledad"", ""Esta Tristeza Se Siente Asi"" and ""Cuando El Amor Se Va"" are songs that anyone who has loved with all his/her heart and been betrayed, dumped or played around with in return can relate to. While I don't know if Johnny Rivera himself has experienced the pain, anguish and despair he sings about I can say that he truly makes the listener feel the painexpressed in the songs' lyrics."
1,Disappointing!!!,"You can't judge a book by its cover...a lesson to be learned once again. Boring pretentious rip-off. What on earth was Weber thinking? Too artsy-conceptual, no real substance."
3,Not for every reader....,"A little too disjointed for my tastes, but still an amusing, thought-provoking read. Those who loved Alcott's books primarily for the style, rather than the story, will probably enjoy this one more than I did. I could definitely see assigning this in a high school literature class."
2,Upscale 'Chick Lit',"This is an often boring piece of upscale ""chick lit."" It is sprinkled with all too frequent bits of literary reference to encourage the reader think she is well-read. The characters in the family are stereotypes. The narrator Jo is 17 and writes like a smarty pants juvenile. The story is interrupted periodically by comments on the plot from the other sisters. After much scene setting the plot begins on about page 90. It ends more or less happily on page 240,."
1,All Names and Dates...,"I was very disappointed in Mr. Lewis' recap of Argentinian history. It read much like a high school history text: with all the key dates and important political figures but very little context and no depth to keep the reader engaged. Dry in tone, nothing but the facts and not much to keep the reader engaged. Ugh!"
4,Edison,"Written 45 years ago, this biography is still the best we have on the great inventor. Josephson focuses as much on Edison's work as he does on the man, and the book can be somewhat technical at times. It is natural to compare it to Neil Baldwin's EDISON: INVENTING THE CENTURY, written in 1995, and Josephson's Edison is much more solid than Baldwin's. Baldwin sacrifices the inventions while dealing mainly with the man; Josephson is much more rounded and deals with all aspects of Edison's life. Highly recommended."
5,Brilliant and orginal thinking about jazz,"There are many histories of jazz -- some purely factual, some scholarly as well as thoughtful, original, and insightful. Joshua Berrett, for whom jazz is obviously an integral part of life, writes the latter kind of history. His book is informative, intelligent,with knowledge and love of his subject. Mr. Berrett writes beautifully, which I found helpful in absorbing his subject. This book is one of the great and memorable studies of the roots and meaning of jazz. If you have any feeling for jazz, this is the book for you.Bruce W. Marcus"
3,Didn't do it for me...,"I thought I was getting thought provoking, creative stories centered on Los Angeles's underbelly with this book. The stories are rather disjointed at times and appear not to have any purpose at all. The characters are well developed and they were strikingly real and compelling at times, but the uneven writing sort of made them loose their sparkle. Out of the nine stories, only ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Two Criminals"" somewhat captured me. The others didn't do it for me. If you are a lover of short stories like I am, you'd want to see whether or not this one is a hit or a miss. To me, Babe in Paradise was a miss..."
3,Difficult to review.......,"If I could review this in 2 parts, I'd rate Talon Drake 6*. He is everything a male lead should be. Wonderful depth, you can see to his soul........Then his 'wife' Regan. Although likeable, her whining and attempts to get away..and the fact that she is frequently in a chemise in her encounters with all the male characters if really tedious. I don't know what Talon sees in her to warrant all his sacrifice. This rates about 2* The other characters are so life like you can touch them. They rate a 5*. The plot is complex and changes but is better than average. I hope there is a sequel for Marcus, Talon's 'dead brother'. So far I haven't found one. If you do please email me at barnardap@aol.com. thanks. enjoy........"
5,You find a piece of yourself in that!,"Everyone who makes investments in the stock markets should read this. It's really enjoying but also with a huge amount of reallity. I really found a piece of myself in all these stories. After this, I'm not a smarter stock investor, but for sure I'll be a more conservative one ..."
4,"Not bad, it is worth to buy it.","First, I am a fan of Shannon Tweed. Although she did not have much nudity in the moveis, I still enjoy the movie anyway. This pack includes two movies at cheap and valuable price."
5,Amazing Shower,"I just installed this shower head and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only do you get the feeling that you're taking three showers at once, but the water ouput is much less than I had expected. My previous shower head caused my tub to fill up with water, but there has been no overflow with this one even though it feels like more water is coming out than before. The only downside is paying $250, but I do not feel any buyers remorse, especially after waking up to an amazing shower every morning."
5,A great reading experience,"The title story alone is worth the price of this book. The eleven pieces differ in original ways and are a joy to read. The author is considered by many to be an acknowledged master of the short story. For just enjoying writing, students who are learning how to write in this genre, and the general reader, this volume is recommended."
3,Cute but not all that comfortable,"I love the look of these shoes, but the arch seems to be stiff and a little on the narrow side for my feet. I do not have wide feet,and my arches would fit into a narrow shoe if not for bunions...I did wear them for an entire day while walking a ton, but they have not sofentend up at all."
3,"Some good, most bad","You can tell Elvis is losing interest in acting and singing by the time you get to ""Spinout"" and ""Double Trouble"". There are a few gems on both soundtracks.On ""Spinout"" the title track is a mild rocker, along with ""Adam And Evil"" and ""Stop, Look And Listen"". The ballads ""Am I Ready"" and ""All That I Am"" are both very good, but after that you have trouble finding a decent song.On ""Double Trouble"", there are some pretty decent fast-paced songs in ""Long Legged Girl"", ""Baby If You'll Give Me All Of Your Love"" and even ""Double Trouble"", but you can tell most of the music isn't very inspired. ""Could I Fall In Love"" is a sappy ballad that is halfway OK, but I couldn't recommend much else. I can say that I can never sing the traditional ""Old MacDonald"" ever again after growing up listening to Elvis' comedic version on this album. It may be goofy, but it sure is unforgettable, catchy and funny!"
2,Not his best,"This Cd includes two of Elvis' less than stellar movie soundtracks, 1966's Spinout and 1967's Double Trouble. Spinout peaked at 18 on the US album chart while Double Trouble only managed to climb to 47. Three songs made the US singles chart, Spinout just made the top 40 while its flip side All That I Am just missed it peaking at 41. Long Legged Girl was a minor hit reaching 63. While the material is not that good, Elvis' performances are. Still this is recommended only for avid Elvis fans."
5,perfect for all Elvis fans.,"This double Cd collection is a must for Elvis fans. I used to have the album versions, but moving a few times, lot of records got busted. So, I went into re-purchasing all my CD'S, and not just Elvis's, but when I recieved these 2, I felt so good inside to be able to hear the music from the films and how happy I was. So, for any Elvis fan, young or old, these are worth the purchase to hear some fun and happy tunes."
2,Double your displeasure,"This CD consists of two Elvis soundtracks from 1966 and 1967. Elvis' career hadn't quite hit bottom at this point, but it was about to. He wasn't exactly getting prime material for his soundtracks, and it shows here. With the exception of ""All That I Am"",Spinoutdoesn't really have any good songs on it. But at least ""Stop, Look and Listen"", ""Adam and Evil"", ""Never Say Yes"" and ""Spinout"" are fun, in a dumb kind of way. On the other hand, ""Beach Shack"" and ""Smorgasbord"" are just flat out awful. As forDouble Trouble, it's even worse. The only song here that is the least bit intriguing is ""Long Legged Girl"". Everything else is terrible, especially ""Old McDonald"" and ""I Love Only One Girl"". This CD is for Elvis completists only."
4,Good Porschephile info!,"A really good body of data on Porsches of the period. I've read this one, the 914 volume and earlier 911 volumes. A couple of minor weaknesses that strike me: I find the Porsche introduction a bit laborious if you read more than one version. Also it is a great pity that the resolution of the photos is a bit low and they cannot be enlarged - there are times when mentioned features cannot he identified. But overall very worthwhile volumes ... unless you don't like Porsches!"
2,Worked great while it lasted...,"Everything about this phone was great while it lasted.Unfortunately, that was only a matter of months. Now I'm using a terrible old phone and looking for something that works.With all of the companies trying to persuade customers how ""green"" they are, it would be nice to find one that makes a product that doesn't have to be pitched into a landfill within months. This wasn't an extremely expensive phone but I would have never paid as much as I did had I known its shelf life was less than some products that are advertised as disposable."
4,"Just ""Okay""","This phone is the second of two replacements for my last two duds, both of which lasted less than two years.The ring tone is very antiseptic, and can't be changed. The volume is too low, and the keypad buttons seem flimsy.But it's practically impossible to find a decent desk speaker-phone, and several other brands have done very badly by me, so I'm keeping this one for now.If as and when serious problems develop, I'll update this review, but for now, the phone, though not perfect, will have to do."
1,RCA 2 Line Phone,"Received phone in poor conditon. The AC adapter was had adapters that fit many different types of devices. The seller promptly paid me back in full, but disputed what I saw and how the devices operated when I received it."
1,RCA 2 Line Speakerphone with Call Waiting/Caller ID,"This is the worst phone I have ever owned. The sound quality is poor and if you try to dial on line 2 there is a very annoying delay when you push the buttons. This phone is not well designed,"
2,Poor Customer Service,"Phone Receiver did not work when Phone arrived. It had a horrible feedback sound which made it useless. Customer Service told us we need to send the whole unit in. After sending the unit in and following up after 3 weeks they wanted to know the Tracking Number. We sent it regular mail w/o tracking number. Customer Service insisted on the tracking number. Anyways. Bottom line is that we need to wait another 4-6 weeks, but Customer Service can't locate our phone. Money spent. No Phone. Done with this company. Good products need good customer service. I consider this a bad product because I got bad customer service."
2,Nice features - abysmal audio quality,"I'm satisfied with the feature set of this phone, but the audio quality is very poor. I put up with it initially since the feature set matched what I needed, but the audio quality has gone steadily worse. There's a permanent hiss on the line with many pops and breaks which are audible to both parties. I'll be getting rid of this as soon as I find a new phone."
3,Works but Nothing Special,"I've used this phone for more than a year and it does work. However, several issues to be aware of:1) The speakerphone has poor acoustics for those on the other end.2) It does have a headset jack but using a headset is not recommended. The sound is so weak the people I'm talking to complain.3) The handset has terrible sound quality.It does work and the speaker/ringer are loud (thought adjustable). However, the poor acoustical quality makes this phone unacceptable for a work at home professional."
2,Bad phone out of the box,"I purchased the RCA 2 line phone with answering machine and the speaker phone did not work correctly out of the box. I didn't buy this on Amazon which I will never do again. phones101.com and RCA both required I pay shipping to get the phone replaced with a working model. My advise, only buy from Amazon and use caution with buying an RCA phone."
2,Waste of money @ $120,"This phone was bought brand new and the sound quality has been very poor. We changed out heddsets, hand sets, batteries, and even amplifiers. All failed to improve the quality. The Caller ID is hard to see, and it's always killing the battery."
3,"great features, but not the greatest build quality","I have owned this phone for about a year, and in general I am very satisfied. There is a very subtle but annoying ticking sound as the ""new call"" light flashes, but that can be eliminated by reviewing the new calls display, which then turns off the flashing light. Also, as others have mentioned, the ""beep"" as you dial numbers is sort of loud, and cannot be adjusted. However, the features of this phone work great for me. Speakerphone with good sound quality, voice mail indicator, headset jack, speed dial, and mute all work well. So well that I recently ordered the same phone for another location. That phone unfortunately had a distinct crackling from the speaker that occurred randomly. It also seemed to pick up radio signals, and occasionally you could hear indistinct voices when the phone was not in use. I am now waiting for an RMA from Antec."
4,Review of RCA 2 line speakerphone,Product works fine. Easy to dial missed calls feature. Only problem is the angle of the screen increasing glare making viewing somewhat problematic. The backlight should be brighter.
2,Radio Frequency Interference,"I selected this phone because it had the features that we need for our business and because it clearly had more quality than the other phones on the market. However, when I set up the phone system, we started getting radio frequency interference (RFI). Essentially the handset cord acts as a radio antenna and we started picking up a local radio station. Imagine trying to have a business conversation while talking over hold music and you'll get the idea. After 3 calls, the tech support people admitted that RCA is aware of this RFI problem but doesn't know how to fix it. They told me that they couldn't correct the problem and to return the phones. Damn shame as this seems to be an otherwise excellent phone system. So beware if you have any radio station towers within a 5 mile radius."
5,Excellent Small Business Telephone,"This telephone is excellent for a small business office. Excellent quality, plenty of features, great sound quality."
3,"Cute, but disappointing","There were some great ideas, and I do appreciate the tools listings, but overall I was a little disappointed. It just didn't seem to be as in-depth as I had hoped. I hope that she expands on her texts in the future."
2,It is better than some...,The author's home is beautiful and it did contain some great ideas. Overall I wasn't impressed. I find more good stuff in my everyday magazines than this. Wasn't worth the $$$.
1,OLD,Very OLD and outdated......not what I thought it would be. Was hoping for a lot of ideas of turning trash to treasure - but it's really what it says....junk.
1,This woman is insane!,I really think this lady has a big time psychological problem..look at her house!!! you can't even walk thru it! there are things hanging off the rafters even;things that aren't even pretty!very very tacky items that I wouldn't even look twice at in a thrift store. Her husband must go nuts with all this fru-fru stuff all over the place! Her first book taken from her other home is much better..she never should've moved...she's ruined this home! She obviouly has never heard of fen-shui! All this stuff just makes me want to suffocate! I can't breathe HELP! (closes the book ah that's better)yuck yuck yuck!
1,junk grotesque,"I ordered this book for the chic in the title, even though this word is overused and there is no chic in this book trust me. Save your money. This book has the tackiest ideas yet. Lots of the stuff looks messy, dirty, dusty, dangerously full of germs. That old white trash deer rug on the bed is disgusting. Not only are these ideas dated, they are ridiculous. Even college girls today know the difference between glam and nonsense. No one who wants to resell or stage a house would decorate like this. Electrical wire on drawer knobs? Cabinets glued onto walls? Grow mold on urns? Who is she kidding?"
4,Gaudy Chic,"Really creative ideas, and beautifully done pieces! The books is very inspirational, I love it!! One bit of advice I have for you to better ""enhance"" the way I percieved the way your art was presented; several areas did not ""blend"" or can i say it was too much different styles and clutter. Pulling a few beautiful pieces of your art w a similar theme really says classy! Your creativity and innovation are outstanding!! But honestly less is more!"
1,over the top,I thought the the book was really over the top. The author's house was not typical of any house I have seen (hard to imagine her ideas in a normal house) and her crafts were outdated and not appealing. How many people can paint a mural or put a covered bed on the deck. This book was terrible. I can't recommend it to anyone.
4,Big Country's 'Rock' album,"Temporarily living in Scotland, 'The Buffalo Skinners' had just been released, amidst much determination from band members that they intended this album to be their best since 'The Crossing', after a few of their more lack-lustre efforts in previous releases. With Simon Phillips on drums #if you need proof of his talent, listen to his work on Judas Priest's 1977 'Sin After Sin' album as a teenager#, the album is an intense, relentless, harsh yet melodic offering, with a touch of the blues. Within a week of the album's UK release I saw the band at their legendary live venue, Glasgow's Barrowlands and they were good, really good. My recommendation: BUY."
5,A moving portrait of Southern black life in the 1940s,"There are few plays that are able to survive the transition from play to book form and The Bridge Party is one of them. The amazing thing is I was lucky enough to catch the performance at the Library of Congress in DC a few years ago. I loved it!The author/playwright took a thought-provoking topic and made the audience cry one minute, then laugh the next. The characters were so real, they reminded me of people in my own family. I'd recommend this book (and the play!) to anyone who wants an entertaining and down-to-earth picture of an America that is not in the history books.Pam"
4,The Black Middle Class,"In this insightful play, Sandra Seaton depicts that during a time of international crisis (WW II) and social suppression (segregation), there was a black middle class in small towns of the Upper South. Ambitious Negro (the contemporary designation) citizens pursue educations, commerce, and migration in order to better themselves. As discrimination suffocates and danger lurks (there is a lynching), women family and community leaders attain social comfort through the tasteful routine of their bridge club. This is a beautiful portrayal of beautiful, mostly hidden people. There was (is) a black middle class, and Seaton is an important product of it. Read, learn, and enjoy."
4,Green Goddess,I love this stuff. I'm on my second bottle. Not too hot that you can't pour it on your tacos (YMMV). Slightly garlicky but not overbearingly so. It's not vinegary like Tabasco and it's thick kinda like ketchup. The green color is quite bright and appealing.I give it four stars because it has preservatives and artificial colorings.
2,An Outline for a Book,"Four systems of play are covered (4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-4-2, 3-4-3) in a grand total of 28 pages. That's an average of 7 pages per system covered. In my opinion, that should be the length of the introduction to these systems. If you are looking for a book to guide you in your decision as to what system to use with your team...THIS IS NOT THE BOOK! No descriptions are given as to what kinds of players could fill the roles in each of the systems. No details are given on how different situations are dealt with given different player alignments. One sample training session is given for each system which would probably take up 20-30 minutes of practice time. There is no discussion on variants of each system. This book does not live up to its title!"
2,"Sorry, no sale!",The electronic bass is too LOUD and distracting. It disrupts your attention away from the featured artist. It's a shame the sound levels ruined a nice selection of songs. Wake up sound engineers ... the album cover is promoting the pianist!
1,The product is not the same as the photo,"I understood I was buying a generic quick release plate (i.e., determined by camera make and not model), but I expected the product to at least resemble the photo. If I had received the quick release plate from the photo, I could use it on my Canon camera. What was sent is machined differently with different screw locations. I cannot use it and will now have the hassle of a return."
5,La Rebelde!!,"Ninel Conde, It's Not Really a Truly Singer.. but her look it's really hot..the song LA REBELDE is one of the themes from ""REBELDE"" a Mexican Novella!Great Album NINEL!"
3,"Great sound, plastic subwoofer housing very fragile","I purchased these after spending a couple weeks reviewing 2.1 speaker sets that were under $200. Overall, I loved them, until a slight bump of the sub woofer against the leg of my desk caused a huge crack across the plastic housing. Everything still worked, but the tightness of the bass dropped noticeably. I used some bumper stickers to hold together the housing, until another slight bump split the housing completely.Don't get me wrong: these speakers were terrific -- sound quality, ease of installation, and overall appearance. Just be VERY careful about where you put the subwoofer unit. Also, the soundsticks scratch easily."
4,Great Speakers,"These speakers sound great. Full bass and crisp, clean upper range. Volume available is usually enough, but at times wish they had more power."
4,gangsta speaker set-up,These are great speakers for the price and quality of sound that they produce. They look pretty cool but the on/off switch is made out of cheap material.
3,"Beautiful Speakers, Sounds great but needs design refining","I had these speakers for about a yearThe good-Its the most beautiful speakers I ever had.The Bad-There is no headphone jack, so i bought a jack splitter at radio shack-You can't tell what sound level its currently on, because there is no indication dialer.-If you notice the sub-woofer has a opening at the top. This opening can invite dust, insects, or other foreign objects to enter the sub-woofer. If enough objects get trapped in the sub-woofer it might permanently damage your system. I recommend covering top with Saran wrap."
2,Breaks Quick,Great speakers. Too bad the blue light turned off one day and speakers stopped working after only 8 months of use! Very annoying!
5,harmran kardon soundsticks ii,Gave these to my daughter for a christmas present. She loves them. Her brother is using them until she get back home from her internship out of town and he loves them too.
5,"Unique Speakers, Great Sound","These speakers are really great looking and they sound amazing. I was worried when I read the other reviews (I thought that they weren't going to be loud enough) but I am sure i will be able to annoy the heck out of my roommates with these. The touch volume control on the satellite is really cool and easy to use, and additionally the satellites have weighted bases so they can be adjusted to any angle. Set up was extremely easy, and it even comes with two kinds of input jacks so it can be used for game systems and dvd players as well as laptops and i-pods."
5,great,"Very easy to install, very high quality and the loudness is awesome for their size, very well designed.Simply they are great."
5,great!,"great speakers and cool look.the sound it's clear and strong,i have no negative comments about this product,i recommend to anyone wants to get high quality speakers for a resonable price."
5,Great price. Good sound. Small footprint.,"If you're considering these speakers, you probably want good sound, a small footprint, and a good price. These speakers satisfy all of those needs.The only negative I've noticed is that since the sub-woofer is small, you have to place it fairly close to the middle of the satellite speakers. If you don't do this, you will hear the direction of the bass.For the price, size, and sound quality, these speakers are fantastic!"
3,Harman Kardon Soundstick 2 defect,"If the soundtsicks work fine,the Sound is excellent.In my case I get the Subwoofer with a defect volume Control Knob.The Control works only in one Posicion and must be pushed in.A email to Harmon Kardon asking for a repair on garanty facility never was answered.Very bad o better no Service.Can't recommend Harmon Kardon CompanyWolf"
3,SoundSticks 2,"Good sound quality. Not very good ease of use. The connector on the sub woofer quite frankly sucks. If I attempt to adjust the sound on the right stick itself the entire system gets muted and I have to remove the plug from the subwoofer and ""play"" with that connection until I can get sound again. Not a happy camper. Deeply discounted yes but not as good as anticipated."
1,Harman SoundSticks 2,The on and off switch does not work and it looked like it was used when it came out of the box
1,Disappointing product.,I had the usb soundsticks 1 for several years and they worked great until I bought a new Intel Mac and the drivers were no longer supported. I bought the Soundsticks II expecting the same performance but they lacked the same bass and volume that my previous pair had. This set may have been defective but I was so disappointed that I returned them for a refund.
2,Good Sound But Quickly Broken,"I bought my first HK receiver more than 20 years ago, and was a loyal customer until purchasing the Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2 last October. They initially sounded great. However, within six weeks, they broke completely, and now only thump repeatedly. I've found several other accounts similar to mine elsewhere on the web. Do yourself a favor: unlike me, research this product BEFORE you purchase it. The Soundsticks are cool-looking to be sure, and they're certainly cheap, but in this case you truly get what you pay for. (One more annoying feature is that there is no ""off"" button!)"
4,crisp and clear,"I have owned these speakers for about 3 months, and I have found no others to replace them the Quality of sound is almost comperable to my Bose system. The lows are deep and the highs are nice and clear. For the price you can't beat the quality. And Amazon is 40.00 bucks cheaper then Best Buy."
5,Excellent sound system,I purchased this product based on its cool looks and positive reviews. I was not disappointed. I thought my previous sound system was good but this one proved even better. The setup was fairly simple. My only complaint is that the subwoofer component is a bit large.
4,speaker system,"The sound is great for the size however, the blue light never goes off unless unplugged. The sticks themselves should actually light up as well. I like eye candy as well as quality sound. If the speakers lit up as well, I would be extremely happy."
5,"beautiful design, excellent sound quality",Harman Kardon Soundsticks are both beautiful and functional. I wish I could find a boyfriend who was like that.
4,awesome,"this product rules for all of us mac lovers this is the perfect buy. the sound is great the look is innovative ppl ask what is that, then they ask ""whats that"" pointing to my subwoofer with the blue light and i tell them and are very impressed.my friend even had a gathering at his house and used the same speakers and they provided perfectly"
4,great for my office,"I am a sole prop businessman. I love these speakers. Great sound. My office is fairly small and I listen to a variety of music and talk shows (jazz, alternative rock, CNBC, to name a few), the sound is very good for all of these.Two downsides. One is that I prefer an understated look. The cutting edge look is not consistent with the professional appearance of the rest of my office. This is actually a plus for most.The other is that I use Sirius radio and have two of my three computers linked up to the speakers. I decided to go through my old radio to amplify the sound. Without it, there wasn't a lot of power to get the sound to a reasonable level. I should say that I don't have the volume turned way up but rather just want to be able to hear the music well when listening."
4,"Great look, great sound, manageable quirks","I use these speakers with my MacBook in my bedroom. I have a great system in my living room and this system is a wonderful complement. The look is great and I'm very satisfied with the sound (I will admit I don't listen to music at very loud volumes in the bedroom).Because I use this with a laptop, the lack of a power switch can be frustrating--there's inevitable feedback when you disconnect the speakers when they're powered on. I've mitigated this by connecting the speakers to a power strip so I can turn them on and off at will. I also wish there was a way to hook up a longer audio cable (or extend it in some way). However, neither of these ""known issues"" make me regret my decision.Can't imagine a better sound or look for the money."
4,Awesome sound for a small bedroom/office/dorm room,"I bought these speakers from amazon last year with a new computer, and I still love the quality of the speakers. I've used them in both a dorm room setting and my bedroom/office setting, and they definitely were worth every penny.It might not be a surround sound system, but if you are looking for a speaker setup that will provide you with great audio and volume at a reasonable cost, then I would definitely recommend these."
1,Can't use on a MAC after OS 10.4.,"Apple wrote the software for harman/kardon SoundSticks II. I am running Mac OS 10.4.11 and they no longer work.The reason is they are no longer updating it for the Mac. I called and emailed both Apple and harman/kardon. Harman/kardon told me this, ""Apple wrote the software and they no longer support SoundSticks II for Mac OS's over 10.4"". Apple will not admit it and they act stupid like they did not have anything to do with harman/kardon SoundSticks II. When I was able to use SoundSticks before, it was great. Apple screws us again!"
4,Sounds great but......,Sounds great but took up too much space on my desk. If you have space for it then you are going to love the speakers
1,Mine died after only a mere 5 month of use - faulty power connector,"The connector where the power cord is inserted into the big speaker has too much play when pressure is put on the cord, causing some kind of distress to the internal wiring. I have no option but to send these to the land fill. I would NOT recommend these speakers.2/27/2007 8:56 PM - Follow up: I sent these back under Harmon Kardon warranty, and they were replaced with brand new speakers within a couple of weeks. I bought other speakers since then so I can't give a new opinion."
1,Missing Part & No Product Support From Harman Kardon :(,"The SoundSticks II arrived. Amazon packaging did an excellent job, the product box was in excellent, unopened condition. I unpack the speakers and made all the connections only to discover that the power cord to connect the AC adapter to the outlet was not included! I called Harman Kardon customer support only to be told that the power cord is out of stock! The agent told me I would have to go and buy a power cord. I asked to speak to the agent's supervisor and was told the same thing: ""the power cord is out of stock, we have none to ship to you. Perhaps there is one in your home you could use?""No quality control. No customer support."
3,Nice sound but...,"Great sound, it could go a little louder. Unfortunately it has its downs; The on-off switch (for some stupid reason) is at the bottom of the BACK of the sub woofer. The sub woofer is also too big!Also the satellite speakers don't light up like the sub woofer, ??Don't know why they decided to put on-off switch and lights on a part of the unit that is supposed to be down on the floor and out of the way??!!"
4,great overall computer speakers,"For geneeral use, these speakers blow the doors over their peers in the same price range. They're also easy to place and attractive to look at."
5,Just as advertised,Keep in mind these are computer speakers. They look nice and the sound is crystal clear. The bass is strong. I bought this a month ago I will report if I have any problems
5,Soundsticks-Wow!,"I am a music student studying opera, and have long been looking for a set of speakers on which I can blast a soprano voice at full volume without any distortion. These speakers can do that and much more. I have gotten nothing but clear, crisp sound from these speakers. They are absolutely the best speakers I have ever had, and at only 1/4 their full volume, they can fill my entire house with full, lush sound. In addition to all of this, they are incredibly cool-looking, and make a great partener to my Mac computer."
4,one big fault -- no headphone jack,"If you want to use headphones on occasion on your computer, these otherwise great speakers arent any good. No headphone jack.Note that the specs here say ""headphone jack"" but that means you plug these speakers into a headhpone on your computer for these speakers to play sound. That doesnt mean there's a headphone jack on the speakers so that you can plug headphones in."
5,It does turn off.,Everyone mentions that the product does not turn off. If you put your finter over the + & - volume buttons at the same time the speakers will cut off. This allows you to unplug your ipod without distortion.
4,Super COOL!!!,"I got these a few weeks ago and use them every day! The sound they produce is really good if you want low to medium sound levels. I don't recommend them for extremely loud music but I like them for my computer. You can plug your ipod into it, hook it up to your television... They look so neat too, it's made out of glass and just the design itself makes you wanna look at it. the sound is amazing."
4,Great speakers,"I bought these speakers for my dorm room and I am very pleased with them. The bass is very powerful but sometimes your music can overpower it during high volume playing with intense bass lines i.e. techno and rap. To solve this you just have to adjust the bass knob to find an optimal position. The towers are amazing and have some serious kick to give you loud clear sound in an aesthetic package. My room always had people in it before but now the addition of these speakers, a strobe light, and a black light we now can always have a good time."
4,Good,"The sound quality is good, although I would have expected better performance, I find that it's great if you wanna listen to music in your room/office, but if you're planning on getting a party going or listen to music in an open space, such as garden, you will find that the volume will not be enough. The look and design is great, very sharp."
5,I LOVE THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM ! ! ! !,Sound quality is amazing !! !! Would I buy another one if something was to happen to this one- ABSOLUTELY !!!!
5,pretty sick speakers,"I got these for my dorm room, and its basically exactly what I wanted. They sound good, look good, and the bass feels good. I agree with the cons from other reviews that the on/off controls and bass strength knob shouldn't be on the bass because its harder to reach, but thats just a little convenience complaint and I would recommend the speakers."
5,awesome speakers,"I added these to my Imac and the sound is absolutely wonderfull, the music really fills the room. can even feel the little satelite speakers pushing air from a 2 feet away. I am really impressed with these speakers and recommend them to anyone wanting nice clear crisp sound and deep bass (I have mine turned down quite a bit cause the base is really strong and clear and you don't have to turn it up much, although I use the EQ in my mac for most of my sound adjustments). You can't go wrong with these speakers."
1,CHEAP DOES NOT EQUAL DURABILITY,"November 17, 2010. BUYER BEWARE. I bought Harman Kardon Soundsticks II from Amazon website,Harman Kardon SoundSticks II Plug and Play Multimedia Speaker System.About a MONTH later, the speakers stopped powering on.I contacted the consumer support group of Harman. Here is the response from Shriram Pawar, with instructions to contact spare parts section: ""Thank you for your email. I am sorry to hear about your problem. Do you get light on the sub? Please try to plug the unit to a different AC wall outlet and check if it fixes the issue. I believe that your power supply may have damage and is no longer providing power to the speaker system, which is why you are not able to get power""I have left a voice message for Harman's CEO, Mr. Dinesh Paliwal. Waiting for a return call from Harman. Again lesson learned, cheap does not equal quality and durability. BUYER BEWARE. Will update as this issue progresses."
2,orz...,"This PC speaker is popular in Japan, too.Why so?That's why this speaker is small and transparent and beautiful.It's funny to look the wiring inside this speaker when you are listening to music. It's fantastic.But unfortunately, the sound of this speaker is too bad.In Japan, the best sound PC speaker is TIMEDOMAIN mini.TIMEDOMAIN mini is designed based on the time domain theoryby Yoshii. Yoshii was a chief designer of ONKYO.Its sound is incredibly real!You can feel the movement of the mouse of a singer.TIMEDOMAIN mini is sold in AMAZON.CO.JP.(see the link below.)http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002Y3MW2/"
1,Why pay more if it just stops working,"Loved these speakers. Until one day they gave up on me. I can understand that, but not at these prices I expect more. Customer service just told me to buy more from them. Who knows? Maybe that is all I needed but if you pay premium shouldn't you get what you paid for?"
4,Stick it to me,"I researched new computer speakers forever and even bought the stupidly expensive Bose speakers which turned out to be a bust- they worked great for maybe a week and then I had to send them back- same thing with the replacement set- the bass got all out of whack and then one speaker stopped working- but on to my HK soundsticks. I was wary at first of buying these because they were out for a few years and I had hoped for the newest and best. These may not be the newest- but they sure are the best. The sound goes from subtle to headbanging,and acoustic doesn't sound computery or tinny. A GREAT value for the money too- I have bought speakers at four times the price that didn't sound this good."
5,Great product for a great price,"We got these speakers to use with our laptop which now resides in the kitchen. When my husband realized that I was using it to listen to radio stations and playlists from Napster and iTunes, he knew we needed decent speakers to go with it.These speakers were just what we needed. The sound is great and we even plug them into iPods and the kitchen TV when we want better sound."
3,Not as good as its rate and price,"I read a lot of positive review of this speaker before I decide to pay 2 time more than my budget to get what it said to be worthy.But the first experience from it do somehow disappointed me. The major problem is that its subwoofer is over powerful while its too thin/light to keep syntony in a low acceptable level. And therefore the bass become out of focus and makes you headache. I have to turn it down to 1/5 to keep the sound clear.However, its satellite speaker do give pretty well song, clear and precise.Overall, it is a good speaker, but not good enough for its price, at least in terms of pure music. But if you are looking for a speaker that can rock the build off, this is what you need...."
4,It does the job. when I use it for the purpose that its manufactured.,"Harman Cardon computer speaker set works great. But I do realize that some of the user interaction interfaces have to be redesigned. To make it more easily controllable. Like volume of the sub-woofer, etc. Apart from that, it produces good quality of sound, looks nice and full fills it purpose."
5,Great 2.1 Sound,"The Soundsticks II are a great 2.1 sound system. They are perfect for small rooms and put out enough volume to please almost anyone. The sound is crisp and the bass response is really good. Some complain about the lack of deep bass from this system, but I think that it is perfect for listening to music (which is what I use the system for). I do not use the speakers for computer gaming, and I don't really want to hear the bass from my system across the street. What these speakers will give you is great stereo sound for music/movies for moderately sized rooms. The bass can be cranked to disturbing volumes if you require this, but at half max level it provides a really natural accompaniment to the music. These are not for block parties or hard core gamers looking to take the pictures off the walls with machine gun fire and explosions."
5,Amazing Speakers!,"Not only do these speakers look phenomenal, but their performance is amazing too. I have these for my dorm room and they always attract a crowd of other students. The bass is truly amazing and clean. You can plug these speakers into anything with a standard headphone port (e.g. your laptop, your iPod, etc). Also the blue glow from the amazing looking subwoofer is a really nice aesthetic touch. I play every type of music on my computer (dance, electronica, pop, classical, opera, hip-hop, rock, etc.) and I cant find a genre that doesn't sound exceptionally good on these speakers. I highly recommend these great speakers (which you do NOT need a soundcard for).P.S. One day I was introduced to this kid I had never met from my hall by a friend. I told him where I lived and he responded, ""Oh! You are the dude who plays the really loud music all the time!"" I just smiled and replied, ""Yup. Thats me!"""
5,Amazing product,"this sound system is amazing. i use it for my laptop, iPhone, and iPad. Great sound quality, subwoofer sounds amazing, and it looks fabelous on my desk.Recommended product."
5,Old-School Stereo Replacement,"I combined this speaker system with an Apple AirPort Express. Now I have all my music at the touch of a button. But what is truly surprising, with these speakers, I don't miss my old component based stereo system at all. They sound much 'bigger' than they look. Granted, MP3 files are not the best audio source, but for my use of casual listening, I could not be happier with these speakers."
1,Awesome....at first,"I just received my SoundSticks today, easy install....great sound! I love them already and would recommend them to anyone. The sub is a bit large so that is why I rated Compactness as a 4. Overall, absolutely amazing. Buy these!Update: The speakers stopped working a few months back....and returning them to the manufacturer was nearly impossible and the customer service from HK was horrible. They are now in the trash.... I really wish they had worked out. :("
2,"Amazing design, not that great sound...","I own several different types of computer speaker systems as I carry my laptop around to different rooms and just plug it in where i need to listen to music. i also own a hotel and use pc speakers until I can afford an entirely new sound system for the lobby and pool area. I have to say that I absolutely love the design of these speakers, but the sound, compared to the rest, just isn't there, and you're buying speakers for sound, right?I recommend the Altec Lansing MX5020 2-piece PC Speaker System - it's simple looking and sounds great - read my reviews about them there. I also have the logitech 560s - they also sound better but who needs all those speakers and controls? If you want true portable speakers, the altec lansing xt-1 speakers are probably one of the coolest products I've ever purchased, they're just amazing and perfect for home or travel!"
2,My headphones produce much better sound (and they are no B&O),The Soundsticks are really good looking but the speakers are too small (or poor) for the volume they try to sound. When it was supposed to work the best (low frequiencies when the subwoofer really gives it all) the speakers make that hideous fuss typical of cheap speakers... A real disappointment.
3,Very nice,"I erroneously wrote earlier that the loudspeakers were weak in output - my bad! They actually have those discreetly placed volume buttons I'd failed to notice - and they were set at the lowest possible level... Now I've corrected that I have all the volume I need. I don't know how to alter my star rating, but they now deserve 5 stars.Aesthetically pleasing, but really weak output. These are not such small loudspeakers that you would understand why they're so underpowered."
3,Harman Kardon Soundsticks II Design and Perfomance Exceeded,The design and performance is great! A little too pricey though for what you get. I was expecting at least aOn and Off Switch and Volume/Bass controls within easy reach. There is a bass control but you have to get on the floor to adjust it. The On and Off switch is a major complaint that I have.
4,Great Sound - a few more details would have made it 5 stars,"I went through a ton of reviews from several sites and finally settled on these speakers. I am immensely satisfied with the product - the sound is great, the look is great, but a couple things kept it from getting 5 stars and they have been mentioned in other reviews here. Why they opted not to add an on off switch is puzzling ( you have to pull the plug to turn the set off ); there is a nice blue light to add some character to the subwoofer in low light setting, they could have added that feature to the soundsticks themselves, but again opted not to. All in all a great set of speakers for a decent price whether you are plugging them into your computer or mp3 player for some room filling sound."
4,sooo glad I bought these!,"I stalked these speakers for a long time, reading reviews and research. Finally I broke down and bought them. I'm very impressed by the sound quality! Very clear, with great bass that is easily adjustable(depending on where you put your sub I suppose). The touch controls on one of the speaker sticks works flawlessly. My only wish is that there was a visual of where the volume level is. Besides that, the design is gorgeous! I love having them on my desk. Cables (one per speaker) run directly to the sub, cutting down on desktop clutter. The blue led in the subwoofer wasn't nearly as bright as I expected, giving it a pleasant appearance without needing to be unplugged at night so I can sleep. For the price range these speakers are great, they fill my small apartment bedroom with sound."
5,Great sound,I just got these speakers with the sole intent of listening to music on my computer. The quality for price is outstanding and I love the sleek style.
3,Good Speakers with some drawbacks,Just bought this Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2 speaker set for my daughter. Good sound but I had the feeling the sound missed some depth. I did not like 3 things about this speaker set:1. No headphone jack2. The blue light always stays on - no off\on button. If this system is for a bedroom you might want to think again. The blue light can be annoying3. Volume control has no indicator of which level you are at. Hard to operate. The volume control is a 2 small touch sensitive areas at the base of the right speaker. Not a good design in my mind.If you like the special design so much you can put up with anything do buy this system otherwise go for another system. You will get better value from most logitech system for that price range.
5,Amazing multimedia speakers,"I got these speakers today and so far they are amazing. I have tried many types of music with them. From classical to rock, to pop and I have to tell you, the sound is clear and crisp and my music never sounded better. Highly recommended!"
4,Great sound for the money,"I bought these a few months ago, and after the first set had one of the tweeters loose, Amazon sent the new ones the same day that I reported the problem, great service!As for the speakers,The sound is pretty good, I think it really comes down to the quality of the music you are playing and these speakers hold up their end perfectly. The touch controls are interesting, but you get used to it after a while.Only problem is the sound varies from where you stand with respect to the ideal listening zone (right in front).I would buy them again mostly just because they look like something from the future as it was thought of in the 1960's."
2,Decent sound but lack of volume knob was a dealbreaker...,"The sound was pretty good, if not a bit too much bass..but the lack of a volume control knob turned out to be a bigger hassle than I even imagined it would be. I'm very proactive with my sounds as my MP3's are all over the place volume wise. To not be able to tell whether my actions would yield a louder/lower sound was the deal breaker. Not only that but you have to contort your fingers/wrist to utilize those silly pads..spent half my time trying to gauge if my actions were providing the desired results..and forget about trying to accomplish this with the lights low..bottom line, I sent them packing and bought the Klipsch Pro Media's instead. So far, very happy...."
2,"Looks great, but poor quality.","I got my set in May of 2005, and one of the speakers blew out barely a year later. Since they were well taken care of and only used occasionally, it's pretty disappointing."
1,Pretty but not powerful,"These speakers have very low sound volume. I tried them with two different machines and got the same result. Thinking that there was something wrong with them, I requested a replacement. However the new ones had the same issue. I connected them to a MacBook Pro, a no-brand PC, and a Dell PC, always experiencing very low sound volume, even though I cracked up the computers volume to the max.The interesting thing is that I used to own these speakers back when they were USB only-connected. They were great then. Well, well, I ended up returning these and connected my old Creative Labs speakers back."
2,Looks and Sounds Great... Until it Dies in a Month,"I think there is a lot going for this speaker system. It is by far the best looking set of computer speakers anywhere near its modest price range. The sound quality may not be audiophile grade, but for its intended purpose (and price) I find it more than satisfactory. My two star grade is due to build quality (or lack thereof). The system died on me in a month... not what I was expecting at all. Now I have some pretty paper weights. :-(I just bought the Logitech THX 2.1 system and it sounds almost identical, but does not look anywhere near as good as the Harmon... too bad. I guess you can't have it all at this price point."
4,Good speakers,I am happy with my Harman Kardon Soundsticks. We use it connected to our ipod for a small-medium sized room.
4,Harman Kardon woofer and speakers,"I originally purchased this item as a Christmas present for someone else. They advised me how crisp and clear they were. Upon subsequently hearing them in a major store, I realized that the sound on these speakers was like no other. They held their own in this large store. My only issue was that it was difficult to ""find"" the volume control; they blended in so well with the actual sound stick. These speakers are used with my computer and sound better than anything I have heard. I recommend them for use with just about anything; laptop, TV, desktop etc."
3,Lacks Power button and headphone jack,"Love the sound quality, but they really need a power button as well as a headphone jack. Better for playing media off your iPod than they are for doing any sort of studio work. When used as computer speakers, it's a huge pain to have to constantly flip back and forth between speakers and headphones."
3,"Good, not great","I have a few issues with this book. The first is the authors obsession with fuji products, he plugs them way to much in this book, at times it is like a magazine advertisement. The second is the lack of color photos in this hardcover book. There is nothing worse than trying to look at a black and white photo and have them explain the colors in text below the photo! Other than that it just needs some updating.Not all is bad, you will more than likely pick up a thing or two that you will use or try out in your next build."
4,rod builder's go to reference,"just about anything you need to know about rod building is in this book. written in an easy to understand manner. if you're going to build your own rod, this book will help you throughout the entire process."
1,Advanced Custom Rod Building,"Dale Clemens may be a rod-building ""guru"" to some, but to me he is simply a 13th degree black-belt .... I was shocked to read his bit on fishing for sailfish on one of his ""custom-built"" spinning rods! Needless to say, he proved himself to be a true ... when he related how the entire rod came apart as he was attempting to horse in a 100+ lb. fish. Like other ""writers"" in this field (fishing), Mr. Clemens attempts to be all things to all people. Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Clemens' effort doesn't work. Simply put, I'd recommend staying away from all of the ""generalists"" and look for authors who devote their respective talents to writing about a narrowly defined topic, be it fly rod building, saltwater rod building, etc."
3,Oldie and not so goodie,"This book is now almost 20 years old in it's newest revision. For that reason most of the blanks and components discussed within are no longer being made or have been superseeded by much more modern materials and parts. I don't think readers will get much from reading about parts and pieces that aren't even made anymore and haven't been made in over a decade. But I did cull some good ideas from the book and the chapter on making your own rod wapping jig is very good.If the writer would update the book I think it would be an excellent reference source. But as it is, unless you can make use of the ideas presented, the rest of it is so seriously outdated that I would recommend a difference source for up to date rod building information."
2,Advanced Custom Rod Building by Skyhorse Publishing,"First impressions:I have a previous edition that I have misplaced, and purchased this one; however, I was not expecting the points enumerated below...1) This edition does not have colour illustrations and pictures, unlike the earlier edition that I had.2) The page/paper material is not that expected of hardcover editions; it is of paperback material."
2,Disapointing,I bought this book expecting it to be rich in geologic data as it relates to science-faith issues. The book was a let down.
3,Sweating the Boards,"I got this boards review along with the John Hopkin's one. I looked at several topics in both and found the John Hopkin's to be a little more in depth and easier to get through (better charts, pictures, etc.). I'll probably go over some of the most difficult diseases in both texts. Though Ferri's Practical Guide to the Care of the Medical Patient is really for residents on the wards, it has always been one of my favorite books since I was a medical student/resident and it works as a great refresher for the boards that you can carry anywhere with you. The other books are bulky and heavy."
2,Excellent quick review,"This is an extraordinary board preparation material as it basically includes the core of the requirements posted by ABIM. It is easy to read; with very affordable tables and images. I highly recommend it to be read through residency as it highlights important core concepts that you can go and research further for a deeper insight in other kind of textbooks or resources. Is very complementary to MKSAP and MedStudy as it let you round and define the important core material. This book provides a nice balance in terms of thoroughness, readability and ability to pinpoint to the high yield material."
5,The little box that solves a big problem.,"Well, as an avid gamer, it was only a matter of time before I had too many systems to hook up to one television. Thankfully, this little box, which weighs practically nothing, provided the solution I was looking for. It's a quick setup, and I have noticed no loss in picture quality or sound.The enclosed directions are a little confusing, but if you can hook up a DVD player to your TV, you can figure out how to connect this thing.I've hooked up a Wii, Sega CDX, a Playstation 3 and a Playstation 2 to it and all of the systems are in perfect working order. I picked this up for $27.00, a price well worth the convenience of not having to disconnect and reconnect systems all the time.Highly recommended."
2,What was it all about??,"There really is no plot, the movie only message seems to be about body temptations (masturbation and sex) and it was pretty boring. Don't waste Your money."
3,"Great movie, but there's a new, much better DVD release than this one","There's a newer and much better DVD of this movie, released in late 2008. It's available at Amazon here:Devil's Playground. (Just to make sure you're getting the right one, it's distributed by Industrial Entertainment, its ASIN is B001EAWMPG, and the UPC on my copy is 858334001381.)That DVD is an excellent, very high quality transfer with breathtaking video and sound as clear as a bell, plus a lot of extraordinarily interesting material added just for that release, including one of the best director's commentary audio tracks I've ever heard. I urge anybody with even a hint of interest in this movie to buy a copy of that DVD, not this one, and do it soon. It may not be available at a reasonable price for long, and it's well worth it. I'm going there right now to write a five-star review."
1,The Devil's Playground,This movie is outdated...the actors are boring...the plot is uninteresting...how it got such good reviews in the past is beyond me. The only reason I watched it is because I bought it...and it was in bad shape ( VHS ) to make things worse. I ended up throwing the movie away...due to it being in bad shape...and boring...boring...boring! Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!,I Love this film. If you are buying it from AAE Films/Allied Artists Classics it will actually be a DVD-R not a DVD. If you contact the company they will offer you a refund and tell you that they will stand behind the DVD-R virtually forever. This is great. Just be aware that you are getting a burned disc instead of a manufactured DVD.
5,DAMIEN,"THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND IS A MOVIE LIKE NONE OTHER.IT TELLS ABOUT THE TABOOS IN THIS WORLD THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WHETHER IT BE IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR BOYS, A CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR GIRLS OR JUST IN THE TYPICAL EVERYDAY HOME. EXCEPT THIS STORY WAS IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR BOYS.JUST WISH THEY WOULD COME OUT WITH A MOVIE, AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE VERY SAME BOYS, WHERE MORE IS TOLD ABOUT THE BOYS, THAN WITH THE PRIESTS."
2,does not cut hard materials as portrayed,"better than nothing, but it has alot of difficulty cutting stainless. You will need to use alot of compound to make any progress"
4,Hyacinth!,"Patricia Routledge is unparalleled in her quest for high society, and Richard just wants a normal life. Recommend this hilariously funny series!"
5,Great set of wheels!,"I just put all the wheels together last night for our son. We just bought his first set of legos (all from Amazon), and I think he's gonna love this set of wheels. He'll have more cars, trucks etc. than he'll know what to do with. They could have included more sizes of tires and axles...oh well, it's still a great set of wheels."
5,Perfect!,"I wanted a plate to sign for our wedding and this one has the cutest little pic. It was the perfect size, too. We still display it, it makes me happy. :-)"
4,Spray 9,This was my first time buying this product. I purchased it based on the reviews I had read. It does what it say it would do. I was surprised on how well it got things cleaned.
1,"Leaky bottle, not suited for mail","I ordered this the first time with other items and the cleaner bottle leaked inside the box. I had to return it with some other items that got some of the solution on them. My replacement shipment was sent quickly by amazon. It had a new replacement for the cleaner and the items I had returned, and again the bottle leaked over the items. Now I'm returning it for a refund. I have ordered other spray solutions from amazon that didn't cause any mess. This bottle is of bad quality, and amazon is doing a bad job of putting it in the same box with other items that you might order. Its best not to order this product online."
4,Great product,I used this product to removed dried on deck stain from my vinyl siding and removed dried paint from a sink faucet that 409 didn't begin to touch. Spray Nine didn't damage either of the surfaces (I did wash them off with water shortly after cleaning). I would highly recommend this product. One negative is that it did leak a bit during shipping.
5,"The best cleaner, period.","Spray Nine out cleans absolutely any other cleaning product, bar none. After I used it for the first time I felt that I'd spent a lifetime getting ripped off by all those other products. It's very, very strong, so check your painted surfaces before use!"
3,"Mildew removal- no, prevention- maybe.","I bought this based on input from other about how well it removes mold and mildew. I wanted to remove the mildew that forms on the painted drywall near our shower stall. This product didn't remove the mildew at all- that still takes Clorox Cleanup. However, once the mildew was removed, I treated the wall with Spray Nine and the mildew has not come back as it used to do."
1,I SPENT $1000 extra....,"this has great picture quality. the sound quality is good too. I like the TV a lot. I don't see where that extra $1000 dollars went though. I woulden't care if I won the lotto or had a ""money tree,"" but i'm an average person. I could have bought a 60"" TV with the same picture, sound quality was around the same, and it costs $1000 less, but it's Phillips, not SONY. from now on i'm going to make sure my TV's don't say SONY on them"
4,Nice,Was looking for something blue to go with Navy blue pants. Was not sure by the description but it is a light blue with Pink (my fave) on the front. It was just a little thinner then I was expecting. It has washed well and overall I'm happy with it. It is a little sparkly on the front logo also.
4,Smooth as silk,"Beautiful playing from two masters. George Van Eps has a long history of playing full, tasteful chords and doesn't disappoint. Howard Alden is one of the best players on the planet. Together, playing gentle standards, they are superb. Highly recommended."
1,Feeder holes are too small.,I bought hardware cloth which is metal screening with 1/4 inch square holes. I removed the screen that came with the feeder and replaced it with the hardware cloth. It works great now.
2,Just didn't match up to the other Tales books,This book was just plain boring and a waste of time. Most of the characters were just annoying and underdeveloped. I'm so sick of a Jedi or Force twist on every story and I can't stand how the good guys always come away the winner. The only two saving aspects of this book are the Fett story and the Stakepole/Zahn story which in itself was still too long.
5,Not your well known characters,Very well written in the star wars form but not the same well known characters in most of the other books. Like the short storys version for easy reading.
2,Disappointing story collection,"Collection of mostly disappointing stories, some really depressing. Not the usual Star Wars quality."
1,Overestimated,"I must say, I was disappoined in this book. First, the short stories were too long and packed unpleasantly with unnecessary detail. Fancy wording took up too much space. Terminology was a bit 'off.' Isn't a Jedi one who has undergone training to become one? Also, if one wants to write a novel, write one, don't try to squeeze it doen to a short story."
