5,awesome book!!!,"This book is a must if you have a family member or close friend who is becoming or is addicted to alcohol or drugs.This book has helped so much.It has answered a lot of questions i had.it provides situations that ive been in and gives advice on what the next step should be.It gives common misbeliefs that even professionals have that are wrong.Love First is just what it says,use love as an intervention first,not punishment.and it teaches addiction has nothing to do with willpower,which i used to think.what this but does to people is to educate us.i found this book at the library.ordered my own copy and an extra.i wish someone would hAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS BOOK A FEW MONTHS ago,instead of giving advice that wasnt true.I did a lot of researching on my own.awesome book!!couldnt say enough about it.thank you,mr. and mrs jay!"
5,Hurray I am not crazy....this is real....,"After years of knowing in my spirit that my loved ones' personality and and their justifications for poor choices were not my failure in doing the right things, this book has given me sound doctrine. The book gives concise examples of enabling which all of us have done from time to time. After reading, I know what cushions the addiction and what techniques to use to help the addicted person not entangle me any longer.. I have been able to use the tools in the book and not be in a constant state of anxiety and frustration knowing that I have no control over what the addict does, that I am no longer a prisoner to their actions. Believe me, the addict sees a change in how you react and they change. This is not a quick fit which we are so despair for but learning for the family a healthy model to work toward for the family to survive and enjoy their lives and relationship with the family unit."
5,Recommend for addiction in family,It is extremely helpful if you have an addict in your family and need to do an intervention. Very clear and gives you a step by step approach. Highly recommend it.
5,Saved my brother's life- thank you!,"My family and I used this book to conduct an intervention for my brother. We only had two people and letters from family members. I also discussed it with a counselor, but mostly I followed the book. We did not have an interventionist. We carefully read how to do it with LOVE and this is the key. Our letters always started with our love and finished with our love. We also had one person lead the intervention and this was also very effective in keeping emotions calm. It worked. My brother chose not to go to rehab but he is in AA now and sober. We could not have done this without the book, truly. I read one review online that said the book and Jeff Jay were terrible, but I am sure that person's family did not really follow the book's recommendations. Doing an intervention is scary, but it could save a life. I strongly recommend this book to anyone considering doing an intervention."
5,Such a great book,"For anyone who has a family member struggling with addiction, this is a great book to give you insight on where they are at and the best methods to get them help. Its highly recommended."
5,The best I've read on this subject,"Whether you are a family member, a friend or a professional counsellor, this book is a ""must-read"" for anyone dealing with alcoholism or drug addiction. It may be painful to read, but it's so true. I am purchasing copies to share with friends. I need their support."
5,A Godsend,"Our intervention group followed the suggestions for a successful intervention to the letter. This was a valuable guide. Our intervention was successful, and I believe a huge part of that success came from the ""how to"" format presented in this text. The book provided answers for every possible scenario and explained the logic behind the recommendations."
5,A classic,"The editorial synopsis listed for this book is on target. Fuller quickly and accurately summarizes the important developments of military theory and tactics from the limited wars of the European kings to the mass warfare of the Second World War, ending with the effect of nuclear holocaust on military strategy.Yes, his analysis of the second world war draws heavily on his anti-communist views. But make the effort to strip away his political viewpoint from his analysis of the interaction of social systems and technology on the method of making war, and you won't be disappointed. Fuller was a perceptive soldier who understood his business better than most."
2,Bad plot,Marylu Henner looks good in this movie with the sexy outfits that she wears but the plot is so lame in this movie all I got out of it was something about a expensive race horse that everyone is trying to get. The humor is bad and the father on the eighties computer is really lame. All of the actors look like they are ready to burst out laughing from the stupitity of this movie.
3,Question,Why was the Homes of Donegal featured in the story when the story takes place in 1936 and the song wasn't written until 1956. How can the character hate something that hasn't happened yet? Just wondering...
1,Non-distinctive and lacks creativity.,"The first five songs are so slow and similar that you think it is one long song. Spend your money on distinctive Celtic music with Enya, Clannad, and Marie Brennan."
4,Works as it should,"Worked about as it should. Fit well, almost too well, tough to remove.Removed radio super-easy. Used on a 2005 GTO, jammed these in, pulled radio right out.Simple"
3,"Easy Read, Most of the Time","This really was a good book. The beginning was very well written, I thought--easy to understand, easy to follow, etc. However, I thought the way the book was divided was a little odd...some chapters made perfect sense, others tended to jump around in time (one minute QE had just been crowned, the next she was almost dead and then it was 25 years prior to her death).I thought that Mr. Hibbert did a great job of laying out the facts without being overzealous in giving the reader his own opinion. It was easy to draw certain opinions of QE's behaviour, but whether that was because the book was so well written or because there has lately been an influx of movies, etc about QE, I couldn't say.I really came to know QE during the reading of this book. Although she was portrayed to her subjects as a goddess (Gloriana, whatever), she really was a paranoid, hysterical, inconsisten human being. Mr. Hibbert did a GREAT job in bringing out the ""humanness"" of QE."
3,An interesting biography,"I would've rated this book higher, except that biographies aren't exactly my favorite reading material. It was well written but many important events, such as the invasion of the Spanish Armada, seemed to be overlooked quite a bit. Her personal life is very well written and at times, quite....interesting? I'd recommend this book for biography buffs and those of you working on your summer assignment for 10th grade. :)"
2,"A very dull, dry piece","Mr Hibbert writes in a very dull, dry tone and I found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story. He confuses the reader with time, people and his interpretation of what Elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen. I only read this because I had to (for school). If you don't have to read it, then DON'T! It will bore you to death."
2,"A somewhat laborious book, with little insight to Elizabeth","Perhaps I was expecting too much of this book when I began reading it; I had hoped that this work would provide an interesting and intimate portrait of Elizabeth, as well as a clear account of the contributions of her reign. However, the book did not succeed at doing either. The book provides some interesting events of the period, but too often keeps the reader at a distance from the Queen. Through cumbersome and lengthy sentences, and boring verbiage, the author loses the reader in the reader's attempt to maintain an interest in the life of Elizabeth I. Having finished the book, I reflected on what I had learned about Elizabeth and found that I had more questions about events that were discussed in the book, than I did before I read the author's account of those events.I highly recommend that any reader looking for a detailed and balanced account of Queen Elizabeth I look elsewhere."
2,A somewhat tedious history of a wonderfully interesting life,"Mr. Hibbert's work includes many pertinent facts, but set down in a somewhat tedious and less than interesting manner. I felt this work did a fairly poor job of describing Elizabeth in context with her time, her problems, the intensity of the religious conflicts of the time, her youth, her relationship with Admiral Seymour, and many other important items. I feel Ms. Weir's work is more interesting, and better done."
5,torque thrusters II,"This polish is everything I've read about it. It goes on good and you need to just use power ball to bring to life some dull aluminum wheels. They now shine as good as they did when I bought them and unpacked them several years ago. They cleaned all the dull areas of the wheel. Other polishes such as Mother's and such, didn't clean as good as Flitz did. I would buy this product again, because it doesn't take much to get a great shine with this polish. Also no real ""elbow grease"" was needed. Put polish on use a power ball wipe clean with a micro cloth for a better than new shine. Just fellow the easy to understand directions for a perfect shine."
5,rock n' roll is back,"A great rock n' roll album from ex-dear ephesus members. It's hard to find a rock band that sounds good these days, but these guys do it very well. As you listen notice the emo breakdowns, and a hint of DEAR EPHESUS. A must have for any DEAR EPHESUS fan, emo fan, or if you just want some rock n' roll. GREAT RECORD!"
2,The Big Book For Peace,"Not a book for small children who are beginning to develope their own morality beleifs. The art is good, however the stories can best be appreciated by adults in my opinion."
4,Good Externally powered USB Hub,"My laptop would occasionally tell my I have exceeded my USB port power thresholds when I plugged in too many external hard drives, flash drives, etc.This externally powered unit solves that problem. It is also good for charging MP3 players, GPS, etc. without having to turn on your PC.The unit appears to have a solid black plastic housing. At first I thought it lacked the LED lights above each port that indicate you have a good USB port connection. Then I noticed that it is actually covered by a clear plastic case with internal black coloring and LED lights deep inside. So when you plug into a port, you cansee a little green light inside the case that comes on.It is small and light weight so there is a tendency to slide around on the desktop."
1,Feminist Epistemologies and Feminist Heavens,"Ms. Tanesini's delightful exercise in imaginary fiction, sophistry, and self-indulgence should be followed by her even more imaginative work on Feminist Heavens. Feminist Heavens (Yup, there are several) are where feminist epistemologists go when they put their epistemologies to good use. Only feminists are there and everybody has a wonderful time for ever and ever. Sandra Harding has dictatorial power, but only exercises her power to stipulate which brand of Brie is eaten for eternity. BYO wine and veritas."
4,Canon DC 22,"I own a Canon DC 22 i previously left a negative report , however now that i can use the camcorder it's actually a very good product. Its best to use mini DVD-WR ( re recordable ) CDs and you must first anitilise your CD then when you are finished recording you need to finalise your DVD ( the DVD recorder needs to be in mode function to finalise - use the on / of switch to get mode ) to watch it on TV or Computer . This is a very good product that works +++ . longer batory life and CD recording time would be great with future models ."
1,Never arrived,I ordered this product for my fiance who was having a baby and recieved an email stating the product was shipped on the 18th of december and would arrive by the 21st On that day it never arrived so I called in and they said they should have sent an email or called Yet nobody had and they had already charged my credit card DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!
1,Not for the experienced programmer,"If you're looking for a way to get started in development as a complete novice, this is probably a good starting point. If you're looking to get up to speed on C# quickly, and you have experience in C/C++ or Java, then look elsewhere. The book is huge, but it belabors very basic concepts, and is achingly slow - the first chapter has a 'what is a computer' section. I don't really find the CBT bit that much more useful than an ordinary book. It's mostly just pages of HTML viewed in a browser, with a little audio. This means to type in any of the programs you're constantly switching windows between Visual Studio & the book text. Easier & cheaper just to use the book, but of course sticking it in a cardboard box with extra CDs means that Deitel can charge an extra ... for it."
3,Overpriced.,"This book is a disapointment. I shold have paid more attention to the other reviewers. However, if the price is not an issue then you could get if for the ability to search the CD for topics of interest."
5,Loved It!!,Yes it is on VHS but after a few minutes you don't care. I loved the information and the highlights were also great. my only complaint is...it over before you know it(27min). I wanted more!I would recommend to any soccer fan of any age!!!!!
4,Not prefect but timeless,"New Gold Dream isn't a perfect album, at least not in terms of it being made up 100% of 9 perfect songs - some tend to drag and show less sparkle or imagination - but as whole this is a magnificent album, one of the defining albums of the whole 1980's music scene, wonderfully coherent, influential and, most importantly, standing the test of time better than any other album from this period. This is one of the best albums ever recorded and, although for the most part the 5.1 mix is woefully inadequate, New Gold Dream still sounds as brilliant and timelessly fashionable as it did back in 1982."
4,A masterpiece!,"It's funny that I'm taking the time to pontificate on this album, because, as a middle-aged (43) man, my taste generally runs toward the postpunk era (think Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Pavement). However, I will always maintain a soft spot in my heart for the ""new wave"" bands who basically got the whole ""alternative"" thing started. Honestly, I played New Gold Dream non-stop for about 3 years straight (and still do). Simple Minds kinda went downhill after this (although Sparkle in the Rain had some definite highlights- Waterfront, Up on the Catwalk, etc.), but, wow, what a beautiful, atmospheric, piece of work this is!"
3,I'm Only Buying It Because of Nostalgia,"Back in the day I was a Simple Minds fan. I saw them numerous times in small and medium-sized venues in Glasgow. So I listened to this album a hell of a lot when it first came out. Since then, I've recognized what I sort of knew at the time - that this album wasn't as good as the three that went before it. It has not aged well. Synth-heavy and slow, it wallows in pretentiousness where the earlier albums - especially 'Empires and Dance' - hit you with as much energy and speed as a welterweight boxer."
5,different flavors would be nice,"the vanilla is ok, but I love chocolate and I could NOT find this product in ANYTHING but vanilla. It definitely tastes ok for vanilla, but chocolate is ALWAYS better!"
3,A Conglomeration,"It's too bad June Carter didn't record on her own in the years she was travelling with, then married to, Johnny Cash. She had a great voice.This album is a little bit of everything, from her adolescence on. If you are looking for nostaglia, this will suit you fine. I found it disjointed."
5,"Alligators, Old Mink and New Money",Totally enjoyed reading this very well written book. It was fun and had lots of information. Being a native of Brooklyn and reading about a transplants adventures there was delightful. Anyone interested in quirky adventures and vintage clothing should read this.
4,Sheer Charm,"This book is a total delight. It's a lot more than a book about vintage clothing. It's filled with interesting -- sometimes hilarious -- insights into the world of fashion, the realities of running a small business in New York and the personal journey of the author. Anyone who cares at all about style would love this book."
2,When it worked it was fair... Not anymore,"I bought this Cuisinart model DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand in January 2009. It looked interesting and made very good coffee. It always accumulated water underneath it, however, causing water stains on my granite counter. And now, 6 months later, it won't turn on. That's a lot of money to spend for 6 months of usage. I'm very disappointed."
2,Hunk-a-Junk,I loved this coffee maker when I first bought it two years ago. It's nice not having a carafe - coffee doesn't burn. After about a year the lights on the front of it stopped working. Shortly thereafter the auto-off option stopped working. This morning it wouldn't even turn on. Cuisinart has such a good reputation -- not sure what happened here -- but I won't buy another one. I only gave it two stars because it does make good coffee when it works.
2,Died after 2 years,"I bought this product in February, 2007 even though it was more than I usually spend because I thought it would last. The brand, Cuisinart, is a well known brand. I had good luck until last week when it just stopped working. When I mentioned this to a coworker, she said she had the same coffeemaker and hers stopped working just like mine this month!! I guess it's better not to spend that much for a coffeemaker if you are going to have to replace it in such a short time."
1,stopped working after 6 months,I absolutely loved this coffeemaker and recommended it to everybody. Now I wish I hadn't. It stopped working after six months. Very expensive mistake.
2,Won't last more than 2 years.,"We loved all the features...keeps coffee hot and will stay for up to 4 hours tasting great the entire time. Easy to clean, somewhat difficult to put water in the reservoir, and the dispenser needs to be a bit taller for a ""to-go"" cup to fit. That said, I recommended it to friends. Ironically, we all have the same problems---after 1-2 years of use it will leak from the reservoir and the dispenser will drip as well. It now seems to have developed an electrical short in the 2nd year of ownership. I think we're going for a Bunn but will surely miss the absence of a caraffe. If you're looking for a great 1-2 year solution for your home coffee needs, this is it. But, be prepared to purchase again."
2,Must have coffee!,"We loved the coffee from this machine, and loved having no carafe, but....it leaked everywhere and then ""died"" one day. I expected better from Cuisinart! One does expect a $100 coffee maker to at least last one year, ours didn't!"
2,Meh...,"I'm very picky when it comes to coffee pots. I had one a few years back that was ideal and after it broke (and manufacturer no longer makes that model) I have struggled to replace it. The Cuisinart on-demand coffee maker is not the worst coffee pot, but certainly not the best. It is difficult to fill...and for $100 a coffee pot is should be VERY easy to work! The basket is too small so grounds are ALWAYS in the coffee (real nice when we have guests over and I serve coffee full of grounds). Also, I wish the coffee would stay hot longer than 2 hours.There are some nice features, including the removable tray (easy to clean) and the lever to dispense the coffee.Otherwise, move along - not worth the price!"
1,Buyer beware!,"Unbelievable! We have a lot of things we liked about the Cuisinart DCC-2000, but we just had our second unit fail on us. They averaged about 18 months before breaking per unit. We called the company knowing that it was out of warranty and were basically told tough luck, but alas all was not lost for they would help us out by selling us a unit for ""HALF PRICE""! Cool, right? Not really; the ""HALF PRICE"" charge is $99 which is $22 more than Amazon charges for the unit new. I'm very disappointed with Cuisineart. Run, don't walk, from this company!"
1,Cuisinart DCC-2000 is JUNK!!,"I bought this thinking it would be good since it isn't cheap. WRONG, it leaks and broke after 1 year. I called Cuisinart and they replaced it, The new one had the same issues and broke after 13 months. Called Cuisinart again, and they won't do anything about it even though you have the 3 year warranty. They only replace it one time. Save your money, this is not worth it."
1,Poor customer service,"I really liked this machine initially. It did exactly what we wanted. The problem is it's longevity. Mine failed after a year and a half. It simply won't turn on. When I called customer service, they blatantly lied and said there were very few problems with this model. They continued by saying if I had not kept my receipt for the last year and a half they would do nothing. I wish that I had reviewed the commentary here before I purchased it. That being said, I will never purchase anything from cuisinart again. They have lost my business."
1,Sending Back due to Bitter Coffee,"I read the reviews on this and was willing to take a chance with the water leaking down the road. I made one pot with this and my second cup was bitter with the typical coffeemaker burnt taste that comes from it sitting on heat. Maybe I was expecting too much. I make my own pods but had grown tired of that and was looking for an alternative. Oh well, the search continues."
1,Junk,"It is junk, when I brew coffee it flows from the valve and I can't get it to stop. Continually have coffee flowing all over the kitchen counter unless I get a cup under it right away."
4,Tired of breaking carafe's!,"I had a 12 cup Cuisinart that was great but I broke two carafes in 6 months so I said enough. My neighbor suggested this coffee on demand model and it has been great. Just fill it with filtered or bottled water cause my tap water is lousy, your brand of coffee and turn it on, that's it, in a few minuets you will hear it beep telling you your coffee is ready. Just put your cup under the fill spout and press the handle and your good to go with a cup of fresh hot coffee. I would suggest that you keep this coffee maker on an open counter top, no cabinet above because you have to lift the lid to put the water in and it does vent some steam so you do not want that venting on your cabinets! Save yourself some money and fore go the water filters, they get expensive! I like to use paper filters because the gold mesh basket does let some residue through into your brew. It is easy to keep clean as well. I would recommend this to a friend."
1,Leaks,"I bought this coffee maker for my mom for Christmas 2006. The coffee it brewed was so-so, and it didn't keep the coffee hot. But she kept it, and used it (I think to keep me from feeling bad). Then, it started leaking. Not water like some other reviewers' machines, but black coffee. A little bit at first, but then four cups of coffee on her butcherblock countertop. It's now stained. It still leaks large amounts occasionally, and the Cuisinart is being kept on another surface now. Whenever I see people looking at this machine in the store, I warn them about it. I have no desire to get a new one under the warrantee. I'm looking for a new one, and I will never buy a Cuisinart coffee maker again."
1,Cuisinart Customer Service Does Not Exists,I have this coffeemaker for 19 months when it died on me (I only use this machine on weekends). I tried to contact Cuisinart by e-mail several times but I get no response.
1,I liked it at first but.......,"We have had this coffee maker for about 6 months, it started slowly driping a lttle after about 4 months and we had to put a cup under the dispenser so it wouldnt make a mess before we got to it, we put up with that, now it leaks almost the full pot we have brewed. This has proven to be a disaster, coffee all over the countertop. I would recomend you do not purchase this coffee maker."
4,The Last Coffee Maker You'll Ever Buy,"This is the ultimate coffee maker! Unfortunately, I discovered that Sam's carried it for $20.00 less shortly after brewing my first potful."
1,Not Pleased.,"I am a coffee lover and in 40 years have gone through several coffee makers. My last coffee maker was a 10 cup Cuisinart with thermal carafe. It lasted less than two years. Undoubtedly this ""On Demand"" coffeemaker makes a good cup of coffee. My objections are: this is a bulky appliance that occupies a lot of space; coffee does not stay warm for any length of time. I took mine back and got a coffee press."
2,12 cup machine only make 2 cups,I love the design. I love the push button for one cup dispensing. But the machine is not a quality product. After only 3 months the machine only pumps 2 cups of coffee into the well. I expect more from a product that costs $100. My bought a $9.99 Black and Decker coffee maker 3 years ago and it still works great. I guess mom still knows best.
5,Just the best!,"We bought our first about five years ago and it quit this year. Tried several other ""quality"" coffee makers but had to come back to this one. Great coffee from the first to the last and never any sediment. Easy to clean and no heavy carafe. Should have bought two so we have no future worries!"
2,Would not recommend,"We drink alot of coffee and wanted to move away from makers with a carafe. We are disppointed with this maker for the following reasons: 1. It is advertised as a 12 cup maker,yet it is restricted to coffee in the basket for no more than 10. 2. It is a basket style filter which we do not like 3. the coffee is always cloudy and muddy. 4. The charcoal water filter pack does not stay put, but floats in the water reservoir.We are now looking at a replacement."
2,"Worked great, until it didn't!","My MIL bought this for my husband as a christmas gift and it didn't last 2 years before it started leaking and then it just completely stopped working a few months after that. The same thing ended up happening to the one my MIL bought for herself. Great idea, but has some flaws."
1,Lasted Six Months!,"I liked this coffee maker while it was working, good concept. At about six months, however, it started leaking and then soon thereafter it didn't work at all. Even though there was power, it didn't brew. Based upon my experience I wouldn't recommend this coffee maker. Plus it wasn't cheap. I have gone back to a ""basic"" coffee maker."
3,Mixed,"I bought this coffee maker based on my percieved ease of use. My friend bought one last year. I wish I had watched him clean it up. I was trying to avoid cleaning a narrow neck carafe. What I like and don't like...Pros:1. Makes good coffee2. Easy to clean the coffee ""bucket"" carafe.3. No glass or narrow neck carafe cleanup required.4. Auto off5. I like the way it looks.Cons:1. It uses about 25% more coffee, for the same amount of water in my old Braun auto drip. The Braun coffee basket is cone shaped and perhaps this concentrates the coffee?2. Placement of the water level gauge, rear, right handside corner, limits counter choices.3. The top lid is hard to clean. The heated hot water is fed through this lid and drips over the coffee basket. Coffee residue naturally builds up on this lid, as in other auto drip units. The lid uses a multi-hole pattern, like a flat shower head. The coffee residue builds up between the holes."
1,Get ready to replace it!,"Loved it, treated it well, but it just stopped after 11 months, just stopped working. I have to replace immediately. It stopped when I have 6 house guests tomorrow! Don't buy it is cool but not worth the hassle."
2,DCC-2000 Life Expectancy - one year,"While I enjoyed all of the functionality of this coffeemaker, you really can only expect it to last one year.I originally purchased my DCC-2000 3 years ago, and had it replaced twice at a cost of $10 shipping each time. My DCC-2000 has now failed a third time, after another year of use. Unfortunately, Cuisinart only honors the limited warranty of their defective product to 3 years from the original purchase date, and will not replace it again.So this is a fine product, if you don't mind the cost and hassle of replacing it every year, up to 3 years. I myself will be purchasing my next coffeemaker from another company."
5,"Brew, and walk away!","I was a little nervous about purchasing this coffee maker, I added to my Amazon cart on a few occassiona and removed, finally I decided to get it and I am very happy I did. This machine brew the perfect cup of coffee every single time - i have yet to have a cup the didn't taste the same! The machine makes coffee really quick - and all the indicators for water level, and how much coffee you have left are nice features - the feature that has stood out the most to me is the the auto shut off feature - sometimes when I am alone I am not going to drink 12 cups of coffee in two hours - so I am able to set it for four hours instead and still get a warm cup of coffe up till and hour after it has shut down! This machine is not on the pricy side either - look at other ones - they are plastic, this is all mostly medal and looks great too! Well worth the money in my opinon!"
5,Great reviews did the trick,"I have used every type of coffeemaker, for lots of reasons, for their looks, for temperature, everything. When I read the reviews, I bought yet another coffeemaker and I finally got the PERFECT one. It looks great, it is easy, and, for me, it is flawless. I will always read a review before I make another purchase on anything. Thank you!"
4,Good coffeemaker,"As others have said, it's a good idea to put the water into the maker prior to filling the coffee basket. The area is small where you pour the water and you're likely to miss and get some water on the coffee before brewing.It also would be nice to have a little light under the spigot as it's hard to see the coffee level at times.I like that it makes a good, HOT cup of coffee. My last 2 makers were the insulated carafe types but they don't keep the coffee hot enough.You do have to remember that you won't have a full coffeepot to put on your table so each person will have to get their own cup.I also got the refurbished one at Smart Bargains and it works perfectly. I honestly had reservations about refurbishment but have spent a lot of money on other coffee makers and they all end up broken in some way or leaking or something so this is a pleasant surprise."
2,Not That Great,I thought I would like this coffeemaker because it despenses a cup at a time. The problem with this coffeemaker is that the coffee sets on a heating element which causes the coffee to burn and taste old fast. Yes I could remove the coffee and put it in another container but that defeats the purpose of Coffee on Demand.
1,poor quality,"Water leaks all over the counter. It does not matter if I fill it to 6 cups or the capacity of 12 cups, I end up with water leaking out from somewhere and it ends up on the counter. As I'm filling I can actually see water leaking into the tray the under the silver grate. Very disappointed in this product."
3,Not that great,"I wanted to go carafe-less and have researched many coffee makers of all kinds. After reading the reviews on this particular model, it sounded like it would work. Well it doesn't. It is too large and barely fits under my cabinets and the vent in the back prevents me from putting under the cabinet, even if it did fit. We like our coffee strong so when I put in the desired amount of coffee for 12 cups, the coffee grinds overflow and get all over the top and into the mug. It doesn't keep the coffee as hot as we like and cleaning it is a major project. I had a DCC-1200 Brew Central coffeepot that was perfect. It got old and needed replacing so I tried the on Demand coffeemaker, bad decision. I just bought a new Brew Central and am happy to have my carafe back. It is the best on the market as far as I am concerned."
1,Do you like coffee grounds in your cloudy coffee?,The cuisinart DCC-2000 coffee maker is not nice. I find the filter to be too small and it overflows into the holding tank creating burnt coffee grounds with my coffee. The coffee comes out cloudy and tastes horrible. I find it disgusting and defective I don't care for the fact it backs up overflows and drips water all over. I have had cuisinart coffee makers in the past and found them wondeful. This one I do not recommend. I am extremely disappointed in the design flaw and the mess it creates.Carolyn Spinsky
3,"great, but stopped working after 2 years","It makes good coffee, and I love the design. Unfortunately, it stopped working after 2 years. The clock works, but it won't start brewing when I try to turn it ""on"". Luckily, Bed Bath and Beyond replaced it for free without a receipt. I'm sure Amazon would do the same. I'll keep this receipt for sure. My previous coffeemaker was the Hamilton Beach 47224 Brew Station which I loved, although it started leaking after 6 months use. I really like the coffee on demand type coffee makers, but my next one will probably be the Technivorm model recommended by America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated. Still, I love the look of this Cuisinart. Buy it, but keep the reciept!"
4,works well ...but,"I bought this for my mom, it worked well for 15 days then broke cold. AMAZON IS AMAZING!!! THEY HAD A NEW ONE TO US THE NEXT DAY.It was a good sale item, not sure its worth full price. coffed can be held onely for four hours. You must set the clock and timer to get that feature to work, default is two hours."
1,Cuisinart carafe-less coffee maker,"We just purchased this coffee maker. Very unique design in that it uses no carafe but a tank inside the coffee maker to store the brewed coffee. You then press a lever to dispense the coffee. My wife has a habit of breaking the glass carafes and so this should avoid this problem in the future. The plastic tank holds the brew basket as well as the coffee and both are removable for cleaning. Full featured with LCD clock, auto start, and adjustable warming time. The most expensive coffee maker we have ever bought but it is well built and most importantly it makes great coffee.UPDATEHave to downgrade my rating to 1 star. While it made great coffee, the coffee maker kept failing. After going through 2 units we gave up and bought a Cuisinart DCC 1200 (with a carafe). We've had it almost two years and so far so good."
5,great coffee and not rocket science!,"After much hinting, I finally received this coffee maker this Christmas. I was so excited to use it and was very impressed when I did. Let me just address some other reviewer's concerns right off the bat:1)It doesn't take a genius to figure out that you can use the inside REMOVABLE resevoir to add the water. Maybe that's what the pour spout is for!2) I was also concerned about my husband's travel mug not fitting under the dispenser until I actually looked at the machine for a minute and realized that if you remove the entire drip tray, there is a cut-out into which your average travel mug fits perfectly.Coffee tastes great and is very hot which is very important to both me and my husband since he likes his with a lot of milk and I usually don't get to have my cup until 2 hours after it's brewed at which time it's still very hot."
1,2nd Broken Machine!!,"2nd Time this coffeemaker has broken!! And yes we actually purchased 2 because while it did work we loved it. Would never purchase again! Each time the coffeemakers life was 6 months. Just quit working. Both times the coffeemaker died it was the same problem, just quit working. The heating element came on but the water did not pump and no brewing. We do not have hard water problems, the problem is the machine. I would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone."
1,Third time was not a charm,"We have purchased 3 of these coffee makers. The first one we purchased worked for 2 or 3 years and we really liked the fact that there was not caraffe , I do not like burned coffee flavor. I replaced it with a new one and started having problems within a month. Stopped brewing called the company and was told to use vinegar brew etc. Repeated this multiple time with no effect. Sent coffee maker back. Before this happend we bought our daughter the same unit and she has had to return hers as well and was given a big run around from the company because she is living overseas (son-in-law) is in military. I had to contact a consumer go between to get some results. I will no longer purchase from this company."
2,After 1 year it started to burn the coffee,I loved this machine for the first year. Now it burns the coffee. Every time. I would not recommend.
1,Expensive breakage,I purshased this item and was very disapointed. It did not last six months before it stopped warming. The same thing happened to the person who had the one I liked. Wasted money!
1,Disappointed,Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable CoffeemakerI love the concept of this coffee maker. But unfortunately I am on my second one in 1 1/2 years and it just quit as well. The first one quit after only 9 months. It was returned to Cuisinart and a replacement was sent. Now this one has quit as well. I own other Cuisinart products that I have had for years but I will not be buying another Cuisinart Coffee Maker. I was extremely disappointed.
4,A bit messy,"I have had this coffee maker for about 5 months now and I really like the quality of the coffee as well as the look of it. Guests always comment on how nice it looks and how easy it is to use! However, I have found that if I am at all sloppy about pouring the water in, it seeps through and comes out the bottom near the cup holder. And even when I think I am careful, there always seems to be some wetness under the coffee maker. This means that every day I have to pick up the machine and move it to clean under it.But since I like the coffee and the design, and the fact that I paid $100+ for it, I will keep using it. I looked at pod-type machines but figured I drink too much coffee to justify the cost of the pods alone."
2,Disappointing,"We have had two of these coffeemakers and loved them both, but they both just died. Worked one day and quit the next. The company was very good about replacing the first one, however the second one (which was new when they sent it) they wouldn't replace as the warranty on the first one had expired. Didn't make much sense to me."
4,Great Customer Service!,"Well, I read the reviews and there were many that complained about their machine broke after just a year. So did mine and my first reaction was to think that I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. After grumbling for a while I sent an email and then a second. I did not receive a response to either. Tonight, I called Cuisinart customer service. To my absolute surprise, after taking a bit of information, they are sending me a new one, on their dime! I'll be looking for Cuisinart products when we are in need of small appliances. The only other company who gives this kind of great service is Amazon."
3,"Leaks, leaks, leaks.","Our coffee maker just gave out after three years and I'm kind of glad it did because I've wanted to replace it for some time. Ours started leaking about a year and a half ago, though I was convinced that my husband was just being sloppy when he filled up the water the first 6 months we experience leakage. If we had used this machine daily, I'm sure it would have quit much sooner. Also, while the easy fill-up might seem convenient, I find regular coffee makers much easier to fill and clean and I don't think this was worth the trade-off.Lastly if you have an active toddler this kind of machine is probably a poor fit for you. Non-locking release button+ curious toddler= coffee everwhere. The release function works even when the machine is unplugged and because the machine emanates very little heat, I was always very paranoid that my son would burn himself."
3,Only lasted a couple of years,"Loved the style of this coffee maker, but as others have noted, it broke down a little over a year. Never had this happen with any of the other carafe types. It was also messy with water leaking, even though I was careful pouring. It's back to the carafe style for me!"
1,Cuisinart DCC-2000 - no power,"I have a daily battle with this machine every morning. Sometimes it won't start up, sometimes it will. I have to plug it in and out 25 times some mornings to get it to work. It also will just power off halfway through brewing. If you're like me, and need coffee in the mornings to get over the grumps...this machine will not help. Actually makes you more grumpy. I figured for the $99 price tag it would at least last a year or more.It's about to be tossed out with the trash so save your money.Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker"
4,Great Coffee!,Very good product. Makes great tasting coffee.The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is the water mess you can make if your not VERY careful.I would buy this coffeemaker again.Kudos to cuisinart.
4,Our new coffee pot,"Well, it makes coffee on a timer, if I remember to fill it up the night before. So far, I am able to remember that 40% of the time.However, it makes a great pot of coffee and suits our needs perfectly. My 90 yr old Mom does not have to remember to turn the pot off, as it will turn itself off at a predetermined amount of time. We can also make a little coffee or a lot of coffee. Previously we had a Bunn, and you had to make a full pot in order to keep the reservoir full, so this is an improvement for us. The coffee is made a bit slower than in the Bunn, but I can deal with it.The quality of the coffee is great. Particularly with my favorite Starbucks blend. Easy to clean and easy to fill. I just use a small pitcher and filtered water (as our local water is dreadful)."
2,Very nice but unreliable coffeemaker,"I purchased my third DCC-2000 in July 2009. It just quit working in February 2010. The previous two coffeemakers started leaking after about a year. They couldn't hold their water.Pros:Makes good coffeeKeeps coffee warm for 2 hours without burning itMakes 12 cups (most CMs make 8 or 10)Very easy to cleanNo carafe to clean or break.Hey, it's EASY to fill with a pitcher. If you can't afford a pitcher, use the holding container, it was designed to fill the reservoir.Looks nice, not cheap.Drip tray is removable to be washed.Easy to read the water level.Three year warranty (register your product, keep your receipt!)Cons:Apparently very prone to leaking, either from the reservoir or the dispenser. All three have Valdeezed at some point, making an overnight setup kind of risky.This one just quit.Use the extra large Bunn paper filters, if you use paper. Otherwise, you may get grounds in the coffee depending on how fine your grind is."
3,DCC-2000 Problems,"I have used this pot for a little over a year, brews coffee fine, keeps it hot, however every time you lift the lid to clean the pot the lid leaks water down the back of the unit and all over the counter. Now one year later the electronics have gone bad, you have to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in, then it works, so much for the auto timer. I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new coffee maker. But be prepared to wait 4 to 5 weeks they are on back order. This is not an unusual problem."
3,Loved it while it worked...,"Same problem as everyone else: loved it while it worked, but after a couple of years it started acting up, refusing to actually turn on and brew coffee."
3,Loved it but it broke,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We loved just pushing the bar and serving coffee and it had a very stylish look to it on the counter. I got used to not having a carafe to deal with. However after less than a year it just stopped working. I was surprised having paid over $100 for this model. I have a friend who has one that lasted much longer - over 3 years. So you just don't know with these.
2,Hot for hours??,"DISAPPOINTEDWhat does the label mean when it says it keeps the coffee ""Hot for Hours??"" DCoes Cuisinart not understand the meaning of the words? It becomes tepid within the hour... kind of defeating one of the main reasons I bought this model. It makes the coffee just fine... no problems there. It just cools down as rapidly as a glass carafe would and if you keep it ""on"" it burns the coffee.I highly recommend the standard models of coffeemakers by Cuisinart. The last one I had lasted 9 Years and a couple of moves too!If you are looking for a cup by cup maker that will last throughout the day... or evening the morning this is NOT the one you want to purchase!"
2,Not bad but not great,"I've had this for about 2 years (maybe a little less) and it just died. I really liked it a lot, my husband hated it. I think I just liked the way it looked more than anything. However for the $100 it cost I really would have thought it would have lasted a lot longer than 2 years. It says it's done brewing halfway through and you have to turn it off then back on about 5 times before it finishes making the whole pot. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did really like it when it was working properly"
2,"Leaks and stains counter top, stopped working",Worked well for maybe 6 months then started leaking on my granite countertop and now does not turn on. Don't think I will get another Cuisinart coffee maker.
4,Very good coffeemaker...,"So far so good. I have it for almost 2 yrs and it still works flawlessly. Coffee taste just the way it should and it remains hot, depending on long you program it to keep the coffee warm. Very easy to use."
4,Great Coffee Maker,"I purchased this coffemaker for our office. Very easy to use, love the water filter and the coffee tastes great. Its a beautiful design and ""fuel gauge"" on the front is wonderful for seeing how much coffee is actually left. We drink coffee in the office all day long, so its very convenient to grab a cup whenever needed!"
1,Great coffee... Just quits in a year.,"Second one of this model. 1st lasted about a year, no refund, just bought another just like it. Coffee is fantastic - tastes better than any maker I have used. Unit just stops working and I use my Mr. Coffee standby. Next morning, it works! Unfortunately, it finally stopped working all together after 14 months. Simply will not heat water to brew. Bummer. Will not buy another."
3,cuisinart on-demand coffee maker,"I like the way this coffee maker works, the on-demand is nice.My only complaint is I wish the coffee was a little hotter whendispenced. If you use milk or cream at all, you don't want itto be cold or the coffee will only be luke warm. It's probably hot enough for someone who likes their coffee black."
2,Died after about a year,"I thought it won't happen to me. I read reviews saying that it dies about after a year, and I can't believe that it did to me too. I made sure to decalcify it, get new filters, wash the basket thoroughly, etc. Then, a few days ago, it just won't turn on. When I decided to buy it, I did saw some refurbished units on sale at O.com but decided to get a new one instead. So, you might want to try a refurbished one in case it dies, then it won't cost too much on your end.When it did work, I like the timer and that it keeps coffee hot for some time, much better than a carafe system. The taste of coffee was okay. I just bought an aeropress to replace this, just tired of machines at the moment. The taste I get from the aeropress is much better than the cuisinart. The other thing that makes a big difference in taste is when I used a milk frother for my lattes.Anyway, just had to warn Amazon coffee maker shoppers that this machine might not last that long."
4,"convenient, makes good coffee","This is our second DCC-2000. The first lasted about 3 years before the electronic controls quit working. We like the fact that the coffee doesn't ""cook"" on the hotplate after it's brewed. We also like the method of dispensing, and the taste of the brew (we use 1 tablespoon per cup, plus one extra per batch...e.g. 9 Tbs for 8 cups). We keep it on the kitchen counter, and it's within reach of the faucet/hose, so filling the container with water is simple.I notice there are several changes in this (2010) model vs. the 2007 model: different electronic controls layout, different finish (the painted silvery surface is easier to clean than the stainless sheetmetal in 2007), the brewed coffee container formerly had a flapped spout & now it doesn't, and there is an improved method of catching condensation when you open the lid. AND THE PRICE IS ABOUT $30 LOWER!We'll just have to see if the electronics hold up for longer than 3 years."
1,Too Broken Too Soon,I enjoyed this coffee maker for about 16 months and then suddenly it wouldn't power up anymore. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect at least five years from a machine in this price range. I had a Braun coffee maker for nearly 20 years and it was STILL working when my wife bought the Cuisinart. Luckily I saved the old Braun and fired it up again. 20 years old and still making great coffee. Moral: Find another brand!
2,Makes great coffee.......but,"The first one that I purchased lasted almost three years. One day it just stopped working. I realized that it had a three year warrantee and called Cuisinart. They offered to send me a new coffee maker. However this model was not in stock. They offered to send me another model, I decided to wait. It took over three months to get a new coffee maker. About one year later the replacement coffee maker stopped working. I called Cuisinart thinking I have a new three year warrantee on this coffee maker...not true. They only warrantee from the original purchase date (of the first one). Why can't anyone make a coffee maker that lasts anymore? It did make great coffee and kept it pretty hot for a few hours."
4,Love my DCC-2000,"I've had the DCC-2000 for about 3 days now and I love it. I was thinking about one of the single cup coffee brewers but really couldn't justify spending $0.50 - $0.60 per cup for home brewed coffee. I guess if I was stopping at Starbucks a couple of times a day that cost could be justified but I don't do that.This coffeemaker brews excellent coffee. The instructions call for 1 scoop (included with coffeemaker) per cup of coffee brewed. Personally, I find that 1 scoop per 2 cups suits my taste. Your experience may vary. I like using the permanent filter that came with the brewer and I like the fact that it has a charcoal filter for the water. I also love the high tech look of the coffeemaker and having a ""fuel gauge"" on the front is a great idea.The only thing I might add to this coffeemaker would be a small light that comes on when dispensing coffee so I could better see when my cup is getting full."
2,Good coffemaker but died after 12 month!,I should have read all the reviews before buying this coffemaker. After 12 month it just died!I tried to plug and unplug which worked for 2 days then it just completely died.Way too expansive for a plastic piece of junk! I won't buy Cuisinart anymore.
2,Not very convenient,"This coffee maker made fine coffee, but the style is not very convenient. You can't see from across the room if you have coffee left or not, you can't swing the pot to the table to fill up cups, and you do have to find a separate jug to fill it up with water (rather than using the carafe). Ours worked fine for 2 years and up and died this morning and I'll take the chance to get a different kind."
5,Cuisinart on Demand,Love our new coffeemaker. The coffee comes out extremely hot and there is no dirty pot to wash. The stainless and black design always looks clean.
2,I can't get good coffee from this machine.,"In searching the web I found some reviews of this machine that said that coffee taste was poor, but most reviews seemed positive. I bought one and cannot make a good cup of coffee with it. I've tried different grounds and different roasts and nothing helps. The ""control"" cups that I make with a single-cup cone filter are immensely better. I have owned many coffee makers in my life and have never had this problem before. I'm going to return this machine today."
1,COFFEE ON DEMAND BIG JOKE,"I purchased this Coffee on Demand, what a joke! I have only had it for about a year and boy what a surprise when I cam back in Kitchen to get my cup of coffee and it was all over the counter. It continues to leak/drip. I had a faberware coffee pot for years and lasted, 39 bucks this one 99 bucks and no good. Dont waste your money.Janet"
3,Big Disappointment!,"I read all of the other reviews before my purchase, but I am very disappointed with the coffee maker. I frequently end up with water all over my counter as the coffee maker does not come with a ""pitcher/carafe"" to pour water from. My coffee has not tasted the same either as it has been harder for me to tell how much water I have been pouring in just from the gauge on the side. One other thing to consider (as I did not think of it before the purchase), if you ever want to put the coffee into to a little thermos for the car or a BIG mug, you have to first pour the coffee into a regular coffee cup and then into the thermos, which can also leave a mess. This could also be resolved if they included a little pouring cup for this purpose."
2,Too much money for its value,"Well, this coffee maker lasted about 2 years. Then it just died -- no warnings. It made decent coffee but not particularly better than the Mr Coffee coffee maker that I used before it (and am now using since this Cuisinart died). The carafe-less attribute was a mixed blessing -- travel mugs don't tend to fit under the dispenser so I had to get my coffee in a regular mug and use a funnel to get it into my travel mug. The best thing about the Cuisinart was the 4-hour shutoff feature. I suspect that it'll be a long time before I buy another Cuisinart coffee maker."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have loved this machine, but it is now dead after less than three years. The coffee was good and it remained hot - a problem with drip machines we've had. Reading other reviews there is an apparent defect that Cuisinart knows about. I called customer service, but without a receipt they informed me based on my serial number my unit's warranty expired several months ago. They offered me a 20 percent discount on a new unit. I have request a supervisor get back to me and will see what happens, but sadly I do not feel we got our money's worth out of this unit and would caution others against buying it."
4,Keeps it hot,"Love the way this coffee maker keeps the coffee really hot. You can program the amount of time you want it to stay warm, start times of course. It makes a great pot of coffee - and it looks cool on the counter! Also love that there is no carafe to break/replace. I would give 5 stars except for 2 things - (1) the filter is hard to insert properly and (2) it's difficult to get the water in without some spillage, at least until you get the hang of it. I have not had any trouble with drips or leaks so far... stay tuned to see how it holds up with our very hard water."
2,sad,I AM SAD TO REPORT THAT ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE CONVIENCE OF THIS COFFEE MACHINE AND IT BREWS A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE IT HAS SERIOUS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS I HAD MY HUSBAND TAKE IT APART AND FOUND A WIRE BURNED INTO SO HE REPAIRED IT AND IT WORKED AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 3 MONTHS THEN JUST QUIT AGAIN I ONLY HAD IT FOR THREE MONTHS WHEN IT WENT OUT THE FIRST TIME IM THROWING IT OUT IM NOT TAKING A CHANCE ON IT BURNING MY HOUSE DOWN. VERY SAD :(
5,Almost completely satisfied,I had been insterested in this coffeemaker for some time. When my coffeemaker died I decided to buy the Cuisinart. I say I am almost completely satisfied because there is one drawback. I didn't consider the fact that some cups and travel mugs are to tall to fill. I have to use a regualr coffee cup and transfer to the mug. I have not have any of the problems some others describe. I am very pleased with my choice and would recommend this to others without hesitation.
2,buyer beware,"This coffee maker makes coffee that tastes good but buyer beware......My husband and I bought our first cuisinart dcc-2000 coffee on demand coffeemaker one year ago. We had it for one week when the handle that dispenses the coffee cracked apart. We took it back. It was replaced with a new model. We were happy with the new model for less than one year. The timer that allows the coffeemaker to make coffee automatically was the next thing to go. We wanted this coffeemaker enough to keep it. This morning, I woke up and it will not work at all. Buyer beware. It makes great tasting coffee, it solves some messy problems but it may not work for very long. Something that costs this much, should work for longer than one year."
1,"leaky the coffee pot, was a holly jolly soul..........","leaksat first it just leaked when my husband made coffee but then it leaked all the time, it leaked so reliably that we kept it on a tray so we could conveniently dump the leaked coffee into the sink. It is NOT worth the $100 price tag however the concept of the potless coffee pot was a good one, too bad it doesn't work. Don't be fooled by the cuisinart name...its not well made"
2,the best thing about this machine is the way it looks,"other than that its an average coffee maker, with a square non-removable carraffe, mine also broke a year in, and i have to wait at least 8 weeks for a new one."
1,Cheap quality,"Whatever you do, do not buy this.All the poor reviews of this coffee maker are correct.The main problem is that there is some sort of electrical problem with this unit andusually within a year or less it will break and be totally non functional.The problem has to do with water condensation and even after knowing this myself I triedto be real careful and wipe it up every time so it didn't build up and spill,I still could not prevent it from failing. The only good thing I can say is that Cuisinartwill send you a replacement unit over and over again with little questioning, but that's because they know thisis a huge problem with this specific coffee maker."
2,Terrible customer service,"Bought this in April-quit working in September. I called customer service and they said it was under warranty and they would replace it and I would have a new one in 2 weeks. Sent me a label to return the broken unit. Now almost 2 months later I'm told it's still backordered and they have no idea when I will recieve it. Asked for a full refund, and after talking to 3 service reps was told they would issue a refund if I sent them a copy of the receipt. Refund will take 3-5 WEEKS! I asked what would I get quicker, a new unit or the refund and of course they have no idea. Don't buy this unless you're willing to deal with horrible customer service. Upon reading other reviews of this item, it's clearly a good idea but has a lot of problems. On top of that if and when it breaks good luck dealing with customer service."
1,Defective - even warranteed replacement didn't last,"Great coffee - agreed. However Cuisinart has blown it on this model. After just over 12 months of great coffee it died. Had to spend $10 to get them to ship a warranteed replacement. Well, just over 12 more months and guess what... died again. Ok, we use it daily, but $30 coffee pots have lasted us 5+ years. They would not replace it - apparently the original lasted on the shelf long enough that the 3 year warranty had expired and thus poof.Try somebody besides Cuisinart for coffee makers - especially avoid this model at all costs."
5,Nice Machine Despite High Price,"First off, this is a great coffeemaker. You're guaranteed about 2.5 hours out of a pot of coffee before it becomes bitter. It is pricy, but it is well made and makes a very good cup of coffee. Also, I've read a lot of complaints about a lack of a decanter to fill the unit with water. Forgive me if I'm not the first to address this, but the internal carafe comes out and can be used to fill the unit with water. The right rear corner of the carafe is designed as a pour spout. I don't even think this is addressed in the manual, so it can go easily overlooked. You can also use the internal carafe to fill your thermos or other container after the brew cycle is complete. My only complaints with this unit are the lack of a bean grinder and that the coffee gauge is wildly inaccurate, but these are easily overlooked."
1,Worst coffee pot ever!!!,"I purchased the DCC-2000 approximately three years ago. Loved it at first. After ten months it just quit working. Sent it in under warranty. (Cost ten dollars plus the price of shipping it back.) Cuisinart replaced it. The second one quit working after ten months. Again, sent it in under warranty. Paid the $10 again and the cost of shipping it to Cuisinart. The third one just broke today after approximately 6 months. I give up! Even under warranty, I can't afford to keep paying the shipping costs."
2,Unreliable,"My problem with this unit is it's unreliability. I love the concept, and when it works - this thing is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. Unfortunately I've now gone through 2 of them. Each time they just stop working. I'm guessing it's electrical - either a switch, or something with the heater. It's too much of a pain to send it back to get serviced. I hoped my first one was a lemming, but my second one has just done the same thing. Googling I found this is a common issue. Shame - if they could solve that, this thing would be unbeatable."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this coffeemaker. I was replacing a beloved Krups which finally died after 4 years of constant use. I don't like scorched coffee, so I wanted a thermal carafe. My husband doesn't like the slow pour typical of thermal carafes, so I thought this might be a great solution. It's not. It does pour quickly. However, the ""thermal"" coffee reservoir is useless. One can program the heat plate to stay on for up to four hours, and the coffee stays HOT and burned tasting. I have mine programmed to stay on for one hour and the coffee is too cool to drink after 90 minutes. This machine would be a reasonable choice for someone who wants a lot of coffee ready to serve quickly all at once, but it's not a good choice for someone like me who likes to drink their morning pot over a four hour morning. It's going back and I am going to get a more traditional thermal coffee maker."
1,"They ain't what they used to be, don't buy it!","I bought mine six months ago. It was fine until last week. It began to not heat the water, now it will not brew. I called Cuisinart and found out they will send another coffee maker but I would have to pay shipping on the replacement and also pay to ship the old one back to them! What kind of warranty is that, wow I would not ever buy Cuisinart again!"
1,flawed machine! don't buy!,"I have owned this machine for about 6 months now and while I have to admit that it's easy and convenient to use, it makes a pretty mediocre coffee. No flavour whatsoever, it's ok, but nothing to write home about...But this is not my main complaint, I would have kept the machine anyways, once I bought it... The problem is - 6 months into using and it died on me, or well, sort of. It has power, and the warming element at the bottom of the coffee reservoir is warm when power is applied, but the maker will not brew a fresh pot of coffee. Probably there's something wrong with the thermal fuse/device. Anyways, the product comes with a 3-year warranty, but do I want to get throuhg the hassle of replacing it only to get another one that might last me other 6 months? I don't know...I'd rather buy a different brand...though I have to admit I love the 'no-caraffe' part of this Cuisinart..."
2,Cuisinart Coffee-on-Demand,"I really liked this coffee maker, until it died. Like other reviewers, I had this thing about a year, and it all the sudden just quit. It has been regularly and meticulously cleaned and well cared for. Considering this is the THIRD Cuisinart coffee maker I have had (the first one broke due to my error, the second one developed a leak), I will not buy another one. They look great but they are so overpriced and are truly no better than a Mr. Coffee or a Hamilton Beach. In fact, I just bought a new Hamilton Beach BrewStation which is just as nice as the Cuisinart, for less than half of the price...and the coffee tastes just as good, maybe even better."
2,coffee pots,"I had this machine for about a year before it just went dead. It was like the electrical mechanism went out or something. I have bought 2 cusinart coffee makers and both of them are junk. I have resorted to buying the $20 Mr. Coffee machine because it is better quality and lasts a whole lot longer than cuisinart brand. Buy at your own risk, but be ready to put money into another one soon."
4,Does the job,"I have had this model for several years now and still like it. It is sleek, works well, and has lasted a long time (but I don't use it regularly--just a few times a month). I do love that I don't have to worry about a coffee pot (breaking); however, there are some down-sides, as well. It's not a fast brew, and it's hard to see when the cup is full if you are using dark-colored coffee cups. Also, it can be difficult/impossible to fill larger containers as they don't fit well under the mechanism. Other than that, though, I haven't had any other problems or complaints...."
5,The Hunt Is Over,"I have had three coffeemakers in the last year including a different model Cuisinart. I have been on a mission to find a coffemaker that makes a HOT cup of coffee and one that will keep the coffee hot for at least a couple of hours without having the coffee taste burned. I was visiting friends in CA who owned this model and I loved it so when I returned home I ordered it for myself. I am very, very happy with it and I think my mission has ended. I also found that it cost substantially less to purchase it on Amazon than in any store. It was $30 more on sale at Bloomies."
1,Stops working and comes on randomly,"I am on my second DCC-2000 and am having the same problem. It has stopped working reliably and comes on randomly. Sometimes i can turn the switch and it will not work. Then about 10 minutes later it may start. Called cuisanart and they will not replace it again since the original is out of warranty. I would not buy this unit as it seems to have this known issue that many other people have run into and the service rep acted like she had no idea of the problem. Although, she did say newer units have been ""modified"" which tells me they know about it."
1,Good for a year,Worked fine for a year then started to leak water on the bottom and then stopped brewing altogether. My cuisinart grinder also broke in a year. No more cusinart products for me.
1,Broken after 14 months,"We purchased this coffee maker for my father for Christmas 2007. 14 months later it is no longer working. Have no idea why. Just will not brew coffee, can do everything else but brew. Very disappointed."
1,Broken again? did not last 8 months,"Cuisinart you got us again! This model we purchased after the constant problems we had with a different Cuisinart model. Well I thought this one would last longer...wrong! These people cannot make a decent coffee maker, save yourself the aggravation and get a different brand.Cuisinart,You might want to consider firing your entire design staff."
1,Don't waste your$$,"We loved this coffee maker so much we even bought a second one when the switch on the first one no longer worked. Shame on us. The second one no longer works and it's been less than a year. When it works, it's excellent, but too expensive for us at $100 apiece per year."
5,Great,This is a great product. I have had several coffee makers over 40 years of marraige and I have to say that this one takes the cake. I love the convenience of the baskets and containers being so readily removable and simple to clean. Filling the coffee maker couldn't be easier and mess free. I really love it.
4,No more pot to break - Not great for wood tables,"I love this coffee maker. I was tired of breaking coffee pots and this has been a great solution. The only warning I have is place it on a surface that can take some condensation. For some reason the steam gets trapped and then condenses on the counter (below the maker). We have ours on a tiled countertop, so its no big deal. But if your coffee maker is placed somewhere that water might ruin the surface, this might not be the one for you."
4,I love my coffee maker,"Until I got this coffee maker my husband and I would always battle eachother about the coffee pots. I enjoy coffee my husband is an addict. He can never wait till the coffee is done brewing before he gets a cup. The ""stop dripping when you remove the carafe"" coffee makers are just a bunch of hooey. I would get coffee spilled on my counter all the time. Not a problem with this product. Plus it makes a great cup of coffee. The only thing I would change is the size of the opening you use to fill the pot with water. I do have a problem with spilling water on the outside of the pot. (especially at 5:00am.) Other than that, I wouldn't part with my coffeemaker. Whenever this one decides to go to coffee heaven I will DEFINATELY get another one."
3,Great while it lasted,"This is by far the best coffee maker I've owned, while it lasted. The coffee is hot, always tastes fresh. However, after a little more than a year, the timed-setting stopped working. After that, the 1-4 cups setting stopped working. And now, 2 years after I bought it, it only brews coffee some of the time. As of this morning, it doesn't work at all (no power). Ah, well. The coffee was near-perfect out of this machine, and if it weren't so expensive, I'd buy another -- I got it at an outlet store originally."
5,Great Coffee !,"Found this Cuisinart in a Condo we recently rented in Scottsdale,AZ. Fell in love with it and purchased one via Amazon as soon as we got home ! Makes great coffee !"
2,DCC-2000 Coffee Station,"I bought this coffee maker because it used a tank instead of a caraffe - eliminating the possibility of dropping / breaking glass. The single cup dispense leaves the other coffee warm because it is surrounded with heat instead of being heated from the bottom and cooling as it rises in the caraffe. The bad thing is after light use .... the programable feature stopped working. Now, it it won't even brew coffee when it is turned on. I cannot believe I spent all this money on a coffee maker that only worked 18 months. I should have stayed with my old workhorse coffee maker. No coffee is a good coffee if it cannot be brewed."
1,Do not purchase this coffee maker,The coffee maker died right in the middle of brewing a cup of coffee. I have owned this machine for 1 year. :-(
2,Water Everywhere,Everyone seems to have similar issues with condensation build up and leaking but my biggest complaint is that I cant fill the stupid thing without water showing up under the unit. Every time I make coffee this happens. This is my only real complaint about this unit. I can live without a carafe but it would be nice if there was as side outlet or something so that I could fill a tall travel cup.
2,"Love the idea, but....","This is the second one I've owned in three years. As others have noted, it's only a matter of time before this coffeemaker starts leaking all over the counter. It's what happened with my first one and now, right on schedule, a little over a year since I got it, the second one is doing the same thing. I know coffeemakers aren't supposed to last forever, but at this price they should last longer than a year and a half."
1,Do not buy,"We bought this coffee maker in June, 2006. I was so excited about the lack of a carafe and for several months, this coffee maker exceeded my expectations...until it quit working. Some days it worked, some days it didn't. Some days it took 2 hours to start a brew, some days it never started.I called Cuisinart support, who told me to use a vinegar/water solution because my problem was a clogged hole due to mineral build up. We went through a gallon of vinegar. It didn't help.They've not responded to me and we finally just went out and got a Mr. Coffee coffee maker for half the price because I can't go without my coffee. Buyer beware, this model has major issues that Cuisinart won't address."
4,great coffee pot !! Would recommend,"This pot works great, coffee comes out hot, and great tasting. Love the dispenser, no glass pot to break or wash. the only thing that I would say that could improve it would be a brighter clock. (that is the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ) The clock in a dim gray , i think crystal led. A nice clock would make it perfect. The pot looks great, makes good coffee and is easy to clean. Who could ask for more ??"
5,Good Morning,"We are very happy with our new Cuisinart coffee on demand coffeemaker, no caraffe to clean or break, very easy to use and clean up. Wish we had gotten one sooner."
1,"Great, broke, replaced, broke","This coffee maker was great... until it stopped working. It would turn off mid brew cycle, then wouldn't turn on again. Cuisinart replaced it as it was less than a year old. A year later the replacement started doing the same thing. I live in an area with hard water, but after the first one had issues I bought a water filter and only used water from there. It's sad because I really liked not having a carafe and would buy it again if it would only last."
2,not again,"We got this coffee maker with credit card points. Before it was a year old the control panel on the front stopped working, making brewing impossible. I called cuisinart and since the machine was still under warranty, they agreed to send me another unit if I sent the broken one back. The new unit would not have a warranty. Within 8 months, this unit had the same issues and stopped functioning. I would say this is a defect in the manufacturing and would not purchase another one."
1,not a good experience,"Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Brushed MetalI have gone thru TWO of these coffeemakers; first one left puddles of water on my counter. Tried to return it but was told I was ""out of time"" and it was no longer covered. I had purchased two of these at the same time and did not return the other one thinking I would gift it to my granddaughter. She did not want it, so I began using it instead of the one that was leaking water. UNFORTUNATELY....this one did the same and it is a pain in the whatever to deal with. Again, can't return it cuz I'm out of time. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,So-So,"I love the coffee it makes and the 1 cup at a time, but it does not outlive its warranty and so I probably won't buy another one."
2,"Poor quality, good only for 1 year","Our DCC2000 is now in the trash. After 1-1 1/2 years it no longer starts. The red light comes on, but apparently one side of the heating device is burnt out. This item is too expensive to fail so early in its life. Stay away from this model."
2,Nice concept but lousy engineering!,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COFFEEMAKER. I bought one of these coffeemakers (for over $100) but it stopped working after approximately one year. Since it stopped working, I have twice contacted customer service at the Cuisinart company but not had any response regarding my warranty. I wished I had spent more time reading reviews and knew that it had a history of failures before I purchased this coffeemaker. I would not have bought it knowing it would only work for a year. I bought it because I liked its clean design, because it is easy to clean and because I trusted the Cuisinart brand. Regardless, you'd be better off finding another coffeemaker that will work for a longer period, not cost so much and one that the manufacturer would be willing to stand behind."
2,"Great product but does not last very long, 3rd one died.","Third one I have owned just died, and like the other times I had not kept a receipt and they said it was manufactured more than 3 years ago so it was out of warranty. None were more than a year old. I love the coffee maker but not at $100/year. Buy two, keep the receipts and plan on dealing with LONG replacement times under warranty. Look around at reviews, this product is notoriously unreliable.OK, got an update. Went to the Keurig and we we only use it when we have company. My wife and I like different coffee and each only drink one cup a day so the K-Kup concept is great for us. Seems to be holding up well with minimal use."
4,Nice coffee maker but put a tray underneath!,"Pros: It has a programmable timer. You can set the length of time it stays on (up to 4 hours). There's no need to have a glass carafe to worry about breaking. The coffee holder area comes out for easy cleaning. The cup holder comes out to allow taller cups.Cons: The fill area is small and awkward. If you miss, the water will run under the coffee holder and get on the burner. If that happens the unit may not turn on and run. There is a hole in the bottom to let that water out but it goes right onto the counter underneath. When you flip up the lid the moisture runs down the back and onto the counter causing a messy situation. Does not accept very tall cups. The pour spout is back underneath and it can be hard to see how much is in your cup.My advice: buy the extended warranty. I had to take mine back 2 weeks before the extended warranty expired."
1,Not worth it,"This was actually my second Cuisinart coffeemaker and was supposed to be an ""upgrade"". Feh. It made weak, tasteless coffee, with a great deal of effort. Coffeemaker leaked continuously, from day one of use, despite careful filling. It died completely ten months after the first day of use, after making an average of a pot of coffee a day.This unit is large, hard to clean, and the stainless steel finish DOES show fingerprints or marks, so be prepared for lots of buffing and polishing.I have given up on electric coffeemakers and have purchased a French Press coffeepot, which serves my needs well."
5,Great coffeemaker,"I really like this coffeemaker. It makes excellent coffee & not having a glass carafe is a big plus to me. Some other reviewer's mentioned having to use a pitcher or another container of their own to pour the water. This surprised me as the coffee bucket has a built-in covered spout & I use the coffee bucket to pour the water into the coffemaker. I checked & there isn't any mention in the instruction booklet about the spout at all. But it's there, it works & never spills the water."
1,Dead after only 10-months,"I purchased this product in April of 2007. It is now February, 2008 and the coffee maker is dead. No power to the unit when plugged in. No clock. No coffee. Fortunately this has a 3-year warranty and I saved my receipt."
5,AWESOME,"Our small office has been looking for a good coffee maker for years - most of them would burn, and the cup-at-a-time maker we bought made poorly-tasting coffee. This one works great. The resevoir keeps enough coffee hot for a small office for hours - with a fresh taste. Easy to clean and fill. Works great."
1,The best little coffee maker I've ever owned,"This coffee maker does everything I need, it makes excellent coffee and keeps it nice and hot. Can't ask for more than that.That was then. I had to repleace the original after 6 months as it quit making hot water. The replacement failed as well so I now have a Keurig."
1,"Bad value, only lasts a year before it dies","We purchased two of these at work. It's a very small office with not many coffee drinkers, so one was used 1-2 times a day, the other just once/day (and not every day). While they lasted they were great-- great features and made great coffee. The one getting the 'heavy' use lasted about a year before it just stopped working. The other one gave out a month later. I don't think it's asking too much for a coffee maker to last more than a year. I will not buy another Cuisinart coffeemaker-- they are pieces of crap, particularly given the premium prices that they charge."
1,So Disappointed - I wish you had 1/2 a star,"I purchased this machine for 3 reasons. The Cuisinart name, no carafe and the style went with my kitchen. It cost me over $100.00 in Loew's. I figured you get what you pay for and so I took the plunge. I say plunge because I've never paid more than $30.00 for a coffee machine before. WELL! I didn't have this for 18 months and it is acting up. One morning it makes coffee, the next morning NO coffee, and my morning coffee is very important to me. (You all know what I mean) I want to drop kick this crap into the garbage. And I took good care of it. I did the vinegar clean out, and brought the carbon filters. Washed it each time, etc. I will never buy another one of their high priced products again. Oh and my husband brought a different model of theirs for our apt. in NY. It's the one with the thermal carafe and that crap DOES NOT keep the coffee hot as they claim. It's back to Hamilton Beach for me."
3,"Nice, but coffee not as hot as I'd like","I love the concept, but find that in the end - the coffee just doesn't get or stay as hot as I'd prefer. It's also a little hard to keep the reservoir that holds the coffee clean."
2,Machine doesn't last long,"I've purchased 2 of these, and neither one lasted more than about 14 months. I like the kind of coffeemaker this is, but I expected it to last longer. It died on me too easily."
5,Awesome,"This is a great coffee maker for day-to-day use, easy to use and maintain. I only use the latte machine on the weekend now. This machine keeps the coffee warm and fits most stainless steel tumblers. The parts go easily in the dishwasher."
5,It's a great coffee maker,DCC-2000 has a great stainless steel appearanceit is convienient to just put your cup in it an push the lever which minumizes spillage. it is nice to be able to set the auto shut off time.I LOVE IT
4,coffee maker,does what it's suppose to do .... make coffee on demand. would recommend this product to anybody interested.
1,Send it back,"My Dream Coffee Maker keeps coffee hot but not burnt, this one keeps the coffee @ 180F (160F in the cup w/cream) and burns it along with your mouth. if you are going to consume the coffee within 15 minutes this one is EXCELLENT, otherwise it's going to taste BURNT. if only it has a thermostat."
1,Please don't buy this machine,"I have owned two of these in the last two years, and both have burned out. With the first one, the program brewing stopped working, and the second one would only work when it felt like it, both after about 10 months of use. When you go to fill the resevoir, water spills everywhere, no matter how hard you try not to, so we kept a rag by the coffee maker at all times. The brewing temperature and storage temperature were just a little too cool for me. You can't fit a travel mug under the dispenser, and it dispenses rather slowly. The display is practically unreadable in low light ( I would keep a flashlight right next to it ). If your looking for a coffee maker just like this, but perfect in every way, look at the Hamilton Beach 12 cup programmable brew station, and read my review. I just purchase that on Amazon, and I think Hamilton Beach studied the Cuisinart, and designed theirs to be far superior, and dropped the price considerably."
1,Still Undecided,"Interested to get this coffee maker...however, the product description does not contain wattage/voltage and I believe these are important. IN my country, our voltage is set at 220-240, and if this product has a voltage of only 110, then there is no point ordering. And whether or not this product can be shipped to the Philippines."
3,"A great, brief life.","Add me to the list of people who bought this, loved it, and after 1 1/2 years, it is dead. actually half dead. sometimes it works,sometimes it does nothing. very helpful to read that this is a common problem - thanks for posting, Amazoners! I will call to get a newone since I am under warranty, but I will not be buying them in the future unless they can fix the problem. Hope they do, as it's a greatcoffee maker, just burns out too young."
4,Coffee on Demand!,Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable CoffeemakerWe are quite pleased with our purchase. The design is simplistic and is an attractive addition to the countertops. If I have any suggestions It would be to add an temperature control to the internal carafe and deepen the basket as the lid becomes saturated with grounds during brewing.
1,"If Condensation Shorting Out Brewing Is Known Problem, Why Doesn't Cuisinart Discontinue or Fix Issue?","Like other posters, this is my second DCC-2000. I was not aware of the common problem of condensation shorting out the timer/brew electronics until now. Our second one only lasted about 3 months before this happened. For $99, and from a name brand like Cuisinart, this should not be happening. It's a great design but with this issue it's just a shiny metal cube and not a coffee maker.That's great that Cuisinart will replace it, but why would I want to spend $20 in shipping (and how much on buying coffee at a store until the replacement arrives) just to get the same model with the same problem. No thanks. So $200 later I'm off to get a new coffee maker not made by Cuisinart..."
4,refurbished,"I saw other reviews about the life expectancy. Odd-I have had one less than 2 years and product support insisted that I run vinegar through it. I finally bought the refurb. and it is just like new! I sent the older one for repair to the MFG. It still was under the 3 year warranty. I will save it when it returns-when the refurb one goes-I will have the New one to use again!Coffee tastes GREAT every cup, no more burned coffee."
1,Have had two units quit working in two years,"Unless you like to replace your coffee maker every year or so, do not buy this product. Have had my second unit go out on me. Both units quit working wihin a year and regularly leaked all over my counter. Moving on to Keurig."
5,So Stylish and Unique!,"I LOVED this when we got this for our wedding! It's or unique, stylish and it works greats! Easier to clean than any coffee pot that I have had!!"
5,coffee drinker,Great hot coffee on demand. Only negative is some leakage if fill to top of 12 cup water measure. Makes less noise than my old Krups and is easier to fill with water.
5,UNBREAKABLE COFFEE POT,My husband has magular so when I bought this machine he loves it puts cup under spiget with mini flashlight pours --bingo it made him happy!I fill the container with a qt. container using a funnel to pour . works wonderful never happier! no glass to break My daughter recommended this to me.
5,"OWNED FOR THREE YEARS, JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE","I have read several reviews of this coffee maker, good and bad. I would have to say to all those folks who are having problems to be sure you are using it properly. People are complaining of water dripping down the back because of filling issues. Use the water hose from your sink. The water that comes down the back, 99% of the time is from the condensation after the pot has brewed. The simple fix for that is to tap the top a couple of times before you open it. I brew about 3 pots a day with mine and have never had one problem. However, I understand like all electronics there are going to be some some duds. I am sorry for those who have received one. But overall for the price the design and the flavor that comes out of this machine, I don't mine buying a new one every 3-5 years. But I haven't had to buy a replacement yet just bought one for the office now."
1,Returned - Defective,"I used this brew station for 3-4 months before operation became intermittent. Selecting manual brew would fail to produce a light. After unplugging & pushing buttons for several minutes, the unit would usually come to life. Finally, after 6 months, the unit failed completely and had to be returned."
2,"Great concept, only lasts for about a year","I have had three of these units. Each quit working after about a year. I see similar experiences in other reviews. If you are willing to pay $100 a year for a coffee pot or do the exchange game as described in other reviews, it is a good choice. Keep a spare coffee maker as it quits suddenly."
2,"Poor Quality, Buyer Beware","I have purchased this coffee maker not once, but twice. I love the concept of not having the caraffe, I love the quality of coffee the pot makes; however, I am disappointed in cuisinart for not making a high quality machine. I purchased the replacement thinking that my hard water was the problem. WRONG! Haven't had the machine for a year and it's already dead. After purchasing 2 of these within the last year and a half, I am done. Don't waste your money."
3,Getting another one but would rate it just 3-1/2 stars,Our group has broken more glass carafes than I can recall and coffee makers with metal carafes seemed to change the flavor of coffee; so we picked this coffee maker. It has already outlasted the last few coffee makers. Some people are intimidated about making coffee in it just because it is not like the other cheapo makers we've had in the past and I admit that it is cumbersome to add water using the its own reservoir but it is worth getting a separate pitcher to fill it with water. We're finally getting a second one to replace another coffee maker that has been leaking for months.This unit is NOT practical if you need to make coffee to fill thermal carafes. It is very dangerous and difficult not to scald yourself when pouring hot coffee from the reservoir.
2,Still crying over spilled coffee,"I used to be in heaven every morning when this machine made delicious coffee before I even awoke. Perfect cups of java available alll morning! Alas, my joy only lasted just shy of one year, when I woke up to coffee all over my countertop and floor. And no matter how I treated my (ex-)love, the leaking would not stop. So, I feel used and abused. To fall in love so deeply, and then to so abruptly end our relationship without any warning... I wish I had never met this cuisinart coffee-on-demand. My heart is broken over spilled coffee."
5,"Good, hot coffee","We purchased this machine because other coffee makers didn't make and keep hot coffee. This machine has not let us down. The coffee is at a great temperature and stays hot. Not having a carafe to fool with has been a big plus, too. Very easy to use - we highly recommend to anyone looking for a change."
1,Died. Just died,"One day the coffeemaker decided to just up and die. Not what i'd expect for something that didn't get harsh use, nor even daily use. I called and spoke with their customer service people who told me 'too bad' it's outside of the warranty, thus there's nothing we can, or will do.Rant: Stop making crap, that lasts a few months outside of the warranty. This is why people have the 'throw it away' mentality these days. Yes, it's just a coffee maker, but for $100, it should at least last 5 years."
5,HOT & READY!,"I LOVE this coffee maker! It is the perfect option for those of us who want the convenience of a Keurig with the serving capacity & of a traditional coffee maker. In my family, we all leave at different times in the morning, so the 6 am person was the only one who got hot coffee. The rest of us had to reheat via the microwave, as the warming plate provided tepid or cold coffe. The coffee is as good at 10 am as it was at 6 am.And it is so easy to clean...just rinse out the filter and container! 3 minutes tops."
2,Broke in 1 year,it broke in one year. tried to send it back and they said since this is my 2nd one i am out of warranty. they said they had no idea what the problem is and this issue is unique and nothing has been reported as a known issue. I had the same problem as the 525 other issues that have been report from all of us. the thing just stops working. Does not brew and the does not turn on. oh one other point. The support person said i should de-calcium the unit by putting in 6 cups of white vinegar to 6 cups of water. this will fix the problem. its like telling me the reason why the car won't start is due to the tire pressurePiece of Crap if you asked me but if you want a coffee maker that does not have a caraffe this seems like your only choice
1,A Pretty and Expensive Piece of Junk,"So, how long did it last? Only eight months. Unfortunately, I read the negative reviews here AFTER I bought it. I started using the paper towel trick to stop the leaking down the back of the machine right away; I kept it clean; I bought the expensive extra filters; I used filtered water. But yesterday, when I turned it on, nada. After about an hour it finally kicked in. It did the same thing today, so I'm junking it. I suppose I could try programming it to start an hour before I get up--but how long will it last like that? Considering the negative experiences reported by people who have tried to get the manufacturer to make good on the warranty, I don't think it will be worth the hassle.It was pretty cool at first--great tasting coffee, and I liked the dispenser idea. But, ultimately, this coffeemaker is a waste of money. Shame on Cuisinart for not making a better product. They are obviously relying on their name to sell a substandard product."
2,Great until it broke,"I bought this machine a little more than two years ago. It was great until it randomly broke yesterday morning. I usually set it to auto-brew so that I have coffee when I wake up in the morning. Yesterday, it made the coffee and then wouldn't turn on again. I have no idea what happened, but that sucks."
1,Quit working within a year,This is an easy review. Always water on counter top. Lots of condensation. Now the electronics went out. I'm now using my 30 year old Coleman camping coffee pot.
1,A Waste of $$$,"I bought this coffee maker (I've owned it for 1-1/2 years) because of the convenience of no carafe, but this morning I discovered the downside. I woke up to coffee pouring out of the reservoir, all over the counter, down the side of the cabinets, and under the stove...it was everywhere. What a cleanup job...not fun at 5:00AM!! It's on its way to the dumpster as I type this.Does ANYONE make a coffee maker that lasts more than a year or two?"
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this coffee maker not too long ago. Although it appeared to brew just fine, it suddenly quit working. I returned it to the manufacturer, who replaced it with another one. It stopped working within 3 months. If that's not bad enough, the dumb thing leaks all over the counter. For the price of this machine, I expect much better performance. I just ordered an electric percolator from Amazon and wish I had done so before buying this inferior machine. Although the ""experts"" seem to believe that drip coffee makers are superior, I think old fashioned percolators brew much more flavorful, hotter coffee with a lot less mess. Can't wait to get my new Presto!"
2,Great coffee but . . .,"I love the coffee that this unit produces. It was easy to program and always performed well...until it just suddenly stopped performing at all. After less than a year in light use, it refused to make coffee any longer. A lot of money spent for very little return on investment."
4,Love it!,"I love this coffee maker. It is so easy to use and clean. As far as leaking goes, I did have a problem with the water leaking right after I would pour it in. After a little experimentation, though, I found that if I pour the water in quickly then I have no leaking problem. When I pour slowly the valve does not work for some reason."
1,Nasty tasting coffee,"I bought two of coffee-on-demand brewers in order to serve coffee in my small bookstore. Like everyone in the other reviews of the DCC-2000, I loved the look of the machine, but after only a few uses of each of them, the coffee started to taste rank. I'm so surprised so many other customers got good tasting coffee out of their brewers. It seems as if old grinds get trapped somewhere and the coffee tastes burned. I even took one of the coffee makers completely apart -- screws and all -- to try to figure out where the old grinds and foul taste were coming from. I found no clues and now one of my machines is ready to be tossed in the municipal landfill."
1,2nd Broken Coffee Pot !!,"Great product ""WHEN"" it worked !The second Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker I purchased in the last two years just died today ... (each one cost me apprx $100)I'm disappointed that I wasted my hard earned money on a $100 coffee pot that only lasted one year. I really did love the product so much that when the 1st one broke I just assumed it was a lemon - so I bought a second one.Now I see other people on the Amazon web-site with complaints about the same thing happening to them and that's even worse! I now strongly believe that Cuisinart must know about this defect but keeps selling it anyway.I always thought the Cuisinart brand name was excellent ... I don't think that any longer ... I will never buy another product with there name on it."
3,Great while it works,"I LOVE this machine. It's convenient and brews very good coffee. However, like so many other reviewers, I feel cheated. For the price, it should last longer than the 10 months we've had it. I won't buy another despite how great it is for a few months!"
3,CARAFELESS COFFEE MAKER,"The DCC-2000 makes a great cup of coffee but there are drawbacks. There is a design flaw. When you open the coffee maker, condensation on the inside of the lid drips onto the back of the unit, causing small puddles of water on the counter. There are drain channels on the lid but they don't work very well....Based on this, I wouldn't recommend this unit....Cuisinart has this flaw in most of it's models....Check it out before you buy!"
2,Too Bad . . .,We too thought the concept was great. We have now gone through two of these machines and both just stopped working. Waste of money.
3,"Generally fine, but...","Generally it has worked fine in the last six months and I like not having the carafe that burns and needs cleaning. Just a few caveats:One time the lever was sort of stuck open or something- I went running after my toddler after I'd set it to brew, and when I came back, there was coffee all over my kitchen. I jiggled it and it hasn't happened in the last few days. But I'm a little worried that there is more trouble to come.The area where you pour water is sort of narrow, and you have to be careful to pour it in there and not somewhere else- it will leak."
2,1 year of use,Agree with the other reviewers. My coffee maker lasted only 1 year. Seems to be a recurring issue with Cuisinart products across the board - reliability.
2,Not built to last,"I paid over $100 for this Cuisinart, had this coffee maker for one year and it died. I paid $20 to return it for a replacement against my better judgment -sent a check for $10 and paid my return postage to ship it back to them. I got to the point where I had to put in five cups of water for four cups of coffee or I'd end up with half a cup of coffee for my second cup. Also I had to put a piece of plastic under it to hold the water that accumulated under it. Six months later and the replacement has refused to turn on. I went to Target and bought a $20 Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and it works great. I can buy five Mr. Coffee coffeemakers for the cost of one defective Cuisinart Coffee on Demand. It makes great coffee when it works, but it seems to be built to expire."
1,Piece of Junk,"The functional design of this machine is perfect for my lifestyle, however it is a poorly designed, piece of junk. My first one worked for 2 years, then the thing quit working. I got a second one, and it lasted 4 months, and the same thing happened again. Now I am on my third, wondering how long it will last. Like other people have pointed out, when you open the lid, water pours out of the back onto the counter from all the built up condensation.Cuisinart is suppose to be associated with high quality appliances, but not in my opinion. You would be better off spending half the money for a Mr. Coffee. Cuisinart stands behind their products and promptly replaces the coffee maker, but my gosh, why would they keep making this thing and replacing defective ones with another one which is just as likely to fail in a couple of months? It's just plain stupid."
5,Makes a great cup of coffee,I have had mine for almost a year and I really like this coffee maker. I have had a lot of coffee machines over the years and this one is by far the best. The coffee tastes better than carafe-type brews and the settings are a great asset too. Honestly if this machine quits working in a month I would buy another because I consider a great tasting coffee worth the money.
5,Only game in town,"I bought this as a replacement for an older version of the same coffeemaker that I had for 6 years (The old one didn't break; it just didn't make coffee as hot as it used to.). It's an excellent choice for one or two coffee drinkers in the household. It makes 4 to 12 cups with no change in quality. There is no carafe to wash or break. It comes with a gold filter if you don't want to use paper. It uses a water filter that is supposed to be changed every 6 months but I have a built in filter in my water supply so I change it less often. The charcoal filter is not that expensive and is the same for all Cuisinart coffeemakers.I haven't seen another coffeemaker like this in the price range. Buy it soon, because it seems like this model is being phased out."
1,Does not last,My wife and I bought this coffee maker thinking that the Cuisinart brand was reliable. Not at all. After about two years it started to leak. We came into the kitchen one morning and all of the water had leaked onto the counter and cabinets. What a way to start your day! The other problem that we should have foreseen was that it is difficult to fill anything bigger than a regular coffee cup.
1,Does not warm coffee!,My sister had received this item as a wedding gift last March. I went to visit her and I absolutely loved it. As soon as I came home I ordered one for myself. Mine does not make warm or keep coffee warm. Will contact customer service...I hope they repair it since it's only been three months since I purchased!
2,NICE WHILE IT LASTED,"I WENT THROUGH 2 OF THE CUISINART COFFEE ON DEMAND MACHINES AND BOTH GAVE UP ON ME. THE MOST RECENT ONE I BOUGHT LASTED ME ABOUT 6 MONTHS. I WILL HAVE TO PLUG IT IN AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS IN A FEW MINUTES AND SOMETIMES A FEW HOURS. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MACHINE. I LOVE THE DESIGN OF THE MACHINE BUT WISHED IT LASTED LONGER. I HAVE TO SAY, I'M SORRY CUISINART HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD NAME FOR COFFEE MAKERS IN MY HOME. TAKE MY ADVISE DON'T BOTHER BUYING CUISINART COFFEE ON DEMAND."
4,Cuisart coffee pot,"I really like this pot, it keeps the coffee warm without making it bitter. Easy to clean, and makes great coffee."
2,wouldnt buy again,difficult to fill with water- consistently makes a mess regardless of how carefully i pour. I would not buy this product again
4,Keep it Clean,"I have had this coffee maker for about 7 years. When it starts to leak, I clean it with vinegar and water. After that, it's good as new!I love it because it doesn't have a carafe, I would probably break it.It's easy to use, I don't understand the issue with having to pour water into it.You have to add water to all coffee makers.I use a spouted measuring cup.With regular cleaning, it will last a long time."
4,5+ years of fantastic coffee,"We bought this over 5 years ago - used it everyday..sometimes multiple times a day! Love how hot it keeps the coffee - we like it HOT! Ours has just now started to leak water and the lid is warped from years of hot brewing but I'm still finding it hard to throw out. As with anything there are going to be pluses and minuses but we've always felt the positives outweighed the negatives. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because from the get go, we couldn't figure out why the designers wouldn't have made it taller so you could put a travel mug under the spout. A large coffee mug is about all that will fit, nothing bigger. We got used to filling a regular mug and then transferring the coffee to our travel mugs..but it was definitely a design flaw in our eyes. All in all though, we loved it and for a 100 bucks - it served us well and it has always looked beautiful sitting on the counter!"
2,didn't hold up,I bought this coffee maker loved the design it only lasted a little over a year...I paid over $100 for it!! A friend of ours had the same one that lasted for 14 months.
3,Works great for 2 years,"Had two of these, and in each case it stop working after 2 years. The coffee maker just would not turn on after about that time frame...I used it almost every day, so it does get alot of use."
5,Worth the Wait,"I received my Cuisinart Coffee-on-Demand last week after waiting three weeks. I love it. As the other reviewers have written, this coffeemaker makes great coffee and keeps it hot without the ""burn"" taste. Also, I gravitated toward this model because I've never been a fan of the coffee carafe. This machine is easy to use, easy to clean and fun to use. It's also great for parties. My other coffeemaker is a Senseo which I use only when someone wants flavored and/or decaf coffee. Bottom line: buy this coffeemaker, you won't regret it. (I love it so much I'm going to get it for everyone in my family for Christmas 2006!)"
3,love not having a carafe / hate the leaking,"I would never want a coffee maker with a carafe again after having this one. However, on the down side - after just a few months, it began to leak water from the bottom. Now it leaks coffee - basically there is more on our counter than in the machine. I will commend Cuisinarts customer service though. I don't have any paperwork on the machine, don't remember where I ordered it from and I called Cuisinart. Told them the issue I'm having and they promptly offered to send a new machine if I was willing to pay $10 for the shipping. Most merchants do not make things that easy these days."
2,Mine died just like everyone else's!,I loved the concept of this coffee maker..however it died after just 1 year's use. Be warned. Do not buy this coffee maker.
2,UGLY PLASTIC,"Ok, if you want good coffee, this is a good coffee maker. I like the carafe-less design and coffee so much, I bought this as a replacement for the same cuisinart model. Previous one lasted 4 or so years so I guess I was lucky compared to some of the reviews.Now for the disappointment: THE FAUX STAINLESS STEEL! As I said this is a replacement and the previous one was a nice stainless that matched the line of stainless appliances in my kitchen. Now I have a grey plastic appliance sitting on my counter top. YUCK!"
4,Love it so far,"I have only had my new coffee maker a couple of days so taking that into consideration, I am happy with it so far. It is similar to my Brew Station that I replaced because of a leaking problem and also the stream of coffee became very small. Anyway, this coffee maker would be perfect except for one small thing: the distance from the dispenser and the drip grid will not accommodate a travel cup that is taller than a coffee mug. I should have realized that by the picture of the red mugs in the advertisement. I bought it for a few office workers and myself and so maybe it is a good thing because 12 cups may actually serve approximately 10 people! As far as the other reviewers who commented there was no container available to put the water in, I keep a gallon of cold water in the fridge and pour it in from that."
1,good coffee BUT....as described by the other 1 star reviews....defective switch,"Cuisinart replace twice...only while under warranty...the 3rd time...they refused, offered no other options...that was when I threw into Garbage and vowed never to buy Cuisinart electrical appliances again!!!"
2,Faulty electronics,"There are pluses and minuses about this product. At first blush, it is a cool coffee maker with a sleek look, and great for grabbing a cup by pressing the dispensor tab. The first cup is good!But, ah, the negatives:Pouring the water in is tricky, as the hole is in the back of the unit. You have to pull it out from under the cabinet, all the way to the edge because the lid has to be fully open, then the hole is fairly small.The ""pot"" is plastic, so I do not think it has as pure of a taste as a stainless or glass tank.Larger cups...the tall coffee cups or to-go cups won't fit under the dispenser. You have to take the grid catcher out.Now, for the title of my review. After one year, the electronics started going off. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to turn it on. I've got a Braun that is now 10 years old and works perfectly. Cuisinart needs to step up its ""insides"" to go along with the cool look.When I replace this, soon, I won't buy a Cuisinart."
1,Don't waste your money,"We purchased this product in April 2008. Just before a year of service was up we noticed it would not turn on or would shut off before completing the brewing cycle. As it was still under warranty we called the manufacturer. They said this was a common complaint and we should unplug it when not in use. (So what good is the clock or timer)? When it only got worse we called them again and they said they would send out a replacement under warranty. We put the new one in service April 2009. About a month ago it stared doing the same thing. This morning July 11, 2010 it quit altogether. Don't waste your money on this product. Good concept, but not built to last."
2,leaks and breaks,"First one leaked, and electronics quit working after a year. We thought it was b/c the house it was in (my fiance's old rental) has bad wiring. Moved to new house, new machine. Sadly, same problems. Leaks, and after 1.5 yrs the electronics suddenly died. If ony 20 bucks wouldn't be a big deal, but a $100 coffee machine should last longer than a year."
2,The DC2000 is NOT worth the money,Bought this coffee pot less than a year ago. Read the reviews. It is not worth the money. Anytime you have to let the pot cool down there is a problem with the wiring or the thermostat. May short out.
2,Junque,"Just a pretty face. The first one lasted three months, then brewed erratically. Each pot took about four ""resets."" The retailer replaced it right away, but when this one breaks we're asking for the refund. I will then get out my checkbook and buy a real commercial-grade Bunn-O-Matic. I've had it up to here (look way up) with cheap coffee machines. At eight cups a day, I demand dedication to cause."
1,So Sad,"I had this coffee maker for about a year and LOVED it. Even after it suddenly quit working a couple of months after the warranty was out, I thought it must be a fluke and got another one. Lo and behold, this morning I have no coffee. Same deal. After about 14 months of use it died. Here's the real kicker, this is my THIRD Cuisinart in 5 years to do this, I had another model that broke before these two. Some people never learn!"
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks...","While the container itself does not leak, everytime you open the top, the condensation will run down the back. This happens no matter how much time between pots. Look under the unit after filling with water and you'll see a huge puddle of condensation. They made a half baked effort to catch the drips in the back (there is a small lip) but it doesn't come close to catching all the water that runs down the back. Sloppy engineering from a ""high end"" brand. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Pretty but failed to function,"Hi,This being my second Cuisinart to fail - I'm back to my old Mr. Coffee - ugly but it works. My Cuisinart failed to draw water after only 4 months. Yes, you can complain to the company but - why should I support a product I have to return and wait on. I need coffee daily.This looks great but do you want your coffee? Skip this product."
2,Cuisinart DCC-2000 12-Cup Coffee Maker,I purchased this coffe maker a little over 6 months ago. It doesn't brew all the water from the resevoir and the filler gauge doesnt work. I am dissatisfied with this product. Also the person that sold it to me didnt have an instruction booklet and gave me $8.00 off. Big deal! It be nice to know how to clean it. I will try calling the store to see if they can dig one out of a new box. They originally said they didnt want to open a new box! I'll never buy anything from that store again!
2,"Great coffee, but unreliable","I'm on my second one of these. The first lasted a month before breaking down. Amazon replaced it, no questions asked. I've had the second two years, and it's in the process of dying. The coffee's really good, but I wouldn't call this a very reliable machine."
2,i do not recommend this,"love this coffeemaker for its looks and also like the reservoir that keeps the coffee hot. HOWEVER, this coffeemaker leaks (yes i am careful with filling, but it goes out the back and all over the counter) and now it frequently leaks coffee from the from the dispenser so i have to keep a cup underneath to catch the coffee coming out. i have had this coffeemaker only about 3 months. VERY VERY disappointed."
1,Very disaponted!!! - TWICE,"My wife purchase this coffee maker on looks alone, and yes it is very aesthetic, but that is where it ends. The first problem I had was you need a seperate container to fill the coffee resavoir, so thats on extra item you need just to fill it up, next while filling if not real careful it is very easy for some water to go into an overflow compartment inside and the water ends up on you counter. Lastly, our first one gave out after one year, I wanted to go in a differnet direction but as with most times the wife wins out so she purchased the exact same one again because it looked good. Well just like clock work at its 1 year anniversary it quit working. Thankfully we have moved on and we never plan on by another Cuisinart product again."
1,Flawed Product - Fails after 9 months!,The design is great. The look is great. It makes good coffee. The control board inside goes bad after about 9 months and you are done with this coffee maker. It's a shame. Don't buy it. Defective product.
1,Disappointed!,"Perfect coffee, great concept!The first one I bought (not through Amazon) lasted about a year, then just died one day! I had loved this coffee maker, so purchased another one hoping my luck would be better. WRONG! After 6 mos, this second one leaks all over the counter and the programming controls don't work! What a disappointment! Don't waste your money!"
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!,"I am giving this coffee maker 1 star because it was the lowest option. If I could, I would rate it less than zero stars. The coffee maker worked for exactly ten days. During those ten days, it brewed excellent, exceptionally hot coffee. On the eleventh day, however, we found water everywhere (on counter and dripping down the cabinet); the little bit of coffee that had brewed was ice cold (with ""On"" button brightly burning). The money was a complete waste and Amazon.com is deducting the return shipping from my refund. BAH! HUMBUG!"
1,Cuisinart Coffee Maker DCC-2000,"Come on people - let's not let Cuisinart take advantage of us like this. Read all the reviews in here re: their design flaw. I just called to get mine exchanged - same problem, no electricity, leaks, etc. etc. Now they are on back order - no telling when they will come in and you have to pay the $10.00 shipping fee. Now that's not a warranty. It would never hold up in a court of law. They need to trash their design and start over. Stop buying their products so they will listen to us - the CONSUMER!"
5,Best Coffeemaker I have ever used.,THE COFFEE STAYS HOT AND FRESH BECAUSE IT IS IN A SEALED CONTAINER.
1,Loved it until this morning.,"I have had the Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffeemaker for about six months or so and loved it. This morning, however, it decided to stop working correctly. I left the kitchen while it was brewing and all of the coffee leaked all over the counter. What a mess! I then made just 2 cups and put a coffee cup under the spout and watched it. Sure enough as the coffee was brewing the spout was spewing. I don't know what coffeemaker to buy now."
2,Enjoyed tremendously - at first,"Loved the concept of this coffeepot - found it easy to use and clean BUT had to return (2) models because they both leaked all over the place. The first leaked water; the replacement leaked coffee. Reading other reviews; it seems quality control may not be a frequent problem - but is a consistent theme...maybe you will be luckier than me! After the 2nd return I bought a Hamilton Beach with a similar set-up - it works great, is ""tall"" enough to handle a travel cup, offers hands free operation when filling your cup AND cost a whole lot less. My advice - skip this one and buy the Hamilton Beach!"
1,coffeeless,"Bought it April 2006 broke down Feburary 2007, looks like I am going to need all three years of that warranty!UPDATE, contacted Cuisinart, they replaced the unit had to pay a $10.00 fee, and received a replacement. This one works OK so far."
2,Two way's not three.,"Please read this first before you buy this lamp.I bought for the amber look to it. The look is greatin a rustic setting or in a room that has orangein it, etc. But for the price I paid it wasn't worth it$159.00. The 3 way part doesn't work at all.So my lamp is only a 2 way, which Ihave to wiggle to get it to turn on.I am looking for a new lamp. Don't buy it."
1,Buy a Uniden instead,I have this system with 3 additional handsets. The talk-time on each phone is about 15 minutes and it takes all day for the phones to recharge. The unit also has a mesh-covered earpiece which is very uncomfortable. I've had this for just over a year and it hasn't worked well since I purchased it. Instead of buying new batteries for each phone I will buy a Uniden system. If I could give this 0 stars I would.
5,A really compelling story of guilt and consequences,"I am really impressed with this story. I know the book is old, and the author includes details in the story which I can't even imagine. (What is a Be-In, for example.) I loved it though. Today, prank calls really aren't as possible or as common as they once were. This carries the weight of extreme consequences from a bad decision. Books like this are fantastic mroality tales for kids because they seem so real. I imagine, in its day, this book was pretty popular.Though I'd like to encourage my students to read it, I doubt it would have the same effect. Cathy is a fantastic heroine and her dilemma is carefully illustrated and thoughtfully played out. The story doesn't end with an unrealistic sweet result either. Consequences change us and Edith Maxwell proves that in the first novel she ever published, Just Dial a Number."
4,"Ian C. Purdie, VK2TIP's Review","I was more than somewhat fascinated upon my initial perusal of the book for review to find it is literally, Complete Plans, Step-by-Step Illustrated Details. Very little electronics involved as such, next to no soldering.For a robotics enthusiast here's a complete set of plans to create something your friends will envy. Your own butler named ""Questor"" by the author, David R. Shircliff.If you want to build a robot, don't want to become involved in heavy electronics, are adept at basic mechanical construction then I recommend you definitely consider buying a copy of ""Build A Remote Controlled Robot""."
2,Hot Summer Nights Just Not Hot Enough,"With a title like Hot Summer Nights I expected some passionate, romantic summer fling instead I got just another boring romance between two boring people. Frankly, this books just didn't have enought passion for me. Although Quentin and Bobbi were likeable enough characters, there was nothing about them that made me want to root for them. In fact, Ms. Anderson spent a lot of time on the facts regarding prison life than she did on developing any passion and romance between the characters. Now I like my books Brenda Jackson and Rochelle Alers hot and this book had only one love scene and I almost missed it, it was so short and frankly dull. This book just does not deserve the word ""Hot"" in its title."
3,Misgivings,"Bridget Anderson brings to you a story of a young woman trying to run from her past yet has built a shelter world which makes it hard for her to accept certain things in her life. Bobbi Cunningham has done everything she can to lead a normal drama free life working as a movie reviewer for a small town paper to taking night classes at a small college in her town but never did she think that falling in love would be in the plan.Quentin Brooks knew he had flaws, but he also knew what he wanted out of life. When he meets Bobbi in class he realizes he wants her in his life but when reality hits of what she wants Quentin wonders will Bobbi ever be his. Bobbi and Quentin go through their ups and downs as they fight the battle of love.Mrs. Anderson exhibits an extremely well crafted writing tone her books are quick yet witty reads with a mellow tone to follow."
2,Artificial,"This book evokes wonderful images of the nature and culture of Brazil but the story it tells, of the instantaneous romance between a black slum dweller and a rich white girl is trite and unrealistic. Updike often tried to hard to show his knowledge about Brazil and its history while neglecting to move the story forward. A final effort at in-depth thought comes too late to redeem the many artificial qualities of the book."
3,Meh,"This being my first Updike novel, I am not sure if I coming across overly harsh. I think my connection to Brazil and its people, language, and culture blur my vision on this novel. Updike has never truly experienced Brazil. He superficially portrays passion which seems more like a low-class porno than the way any Brazilian speaks or acts. The ""mystical realism"" that I so hoped would resemble a Garcia-Marques story, is fake and incredibly unbelievable. Excellent writing, poor subject, and even worse character development. Wish I never purchased this book."
1,just awful...,"i was hoping to be whisked away on a garcia marquez-type fantasy journey, but instead i got some simplistic and idealistic brasil from some old timer. blech."
5,"thinking for yourself, leads to giving yourself","This was such a great book, this was a book i originally choose from a list for my english class but it turned out to be one of my favorites of all time, the way the book traces the hard times and good times, the love, the triumph, makes life seem more like an adventure than a seris of sequences. Be sure to notice in this book that the variety of life explodes in your face."
4,Pretty good,"Brazil is the interracial love story of Isabel and Tristao. Isabel is white and Tristao is black. The two have to run out of town to get away from Isabel's very powerful father. Their lovestory is very freaky, they try some of everything in their relationship. Isabel does finds someone that does a spell and make her black and Tristo white, so he can be treated better by whites. The story goes through twenty two years starting in the mid sixties. Most of the action takes place in Brazil. The book gives you a look at interracial love in another country."
2,the only truly disappointing Updike I've read,"While he still has the beautiful and vivid descriptions that draw me back again and again, the whole book seems to be an excuse to show off Updike's research skills."
1,Rabbit sucks,"Never a big fan of the great WASP male writer that Updike is , or was, I am pleased to see that so many also thought this book was awful, on a number of levels. For me, just the hubris to call the book Brazil, as if it were the last word was offensive from the get-go. Then add all the Portuguese words in italics sprinkled through to give some authenticity ---please . . . Someone gave me this novel before I moved to Brazil in 1997. It is so far-fetched as to be insulting. The only good thing about this book is that it inspired me to write my own book, a memoir of a real country, with amazing people and a fascinating history, an incredibly vibrant culture and landscapes too fabulous to be invented. Updike was really the ugly American on this one. RIP, gringo."
2,Never takes off,"Perhaps Updike has read too many adulatory reviews of his work proclaming things like 'Updike is a master, he can do anything he wants'. He took a short trip to Brazil and wrote a novel about it. Unfortunately, this is a challenge too far for the granddaddy of American letters. His use of the Tristan and Isolde myth to create a tale of two young lovers: a lithe, poor street boy and a privileged girl is full of wistful cliches about glistening sand, Marxist politics and mahogany tight skins entwining in feral sex. Updike's Brazil fails to convince as his portraits of East Coast America do. The reality is far more complex and wilder than can be done justice by Updike's polished pen."
1,Poor and unconvincing,"Brazil tells the predictable story of Tristao and Isabel, the ill-fated lovers, and John Updike is an able writer with clean and polished prose. Unfortunately the book is full of quite a lot of nonsense, including some very poor dialogue, and combined with the hard-nose realistic style, the end result is rather frigid. But my chief complaint is this: When someone calls his book 'Brazil' it should be safe to assume that the author has something important and truthful to say about the country. Updike's Brazil is stale and stereotypical, and none of the characters are even remotely believable as Brazilians. He misses the most important point about Brazil althogether: Its people are warm, caring, both passionate and compassionate. None of this comes through. This book is really not worth reading."
3,No Directions in box,"I Received this product and have no idea how to use it. There were no directions, no pamphlets, not even directions printed on the box.I applied some of the gel and tried it where I thought I probably should try it and I did feel the muscles working, however I was afraid to continue because I don't know if I'm putting it in the right spots and I don't know how long I'm suppose to do it for.Anyone have any idea of where I can get the directions?So far I am rating it a 3 because it seems like it is going to work once I know how to work it!"
1,I don't know if it works,"The unit I rec'd was a dud. I wouldn't know if it works or not because it didn't ""work"". I didn't choose to replace it with another unit because Ihave little confidence in a product's longevity that comes straight out of the box non-functional.HOWEVER, customer service addressed my problem promptly and assured me that a full refund would be issued witout a restocking fee. We shall see."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this because I figured it couldn't be TOO different fromNuFace Microcurrent Toner for Lifting and Toning the Faceother than the brand and price. Maybe the principle is the same, but this would turn on and off(according to the light on the product) no matter what I did or didn't do with it. Approximately 2/3 of the time when the light was consistently on, I didn't feel ANY stimulation. And because most of the time I felt no stimulation at all, I would turn the intensity all the way up and it would be shocking because it would be immediate and not consistent--that in itself might actually damage the skin..definitely give uneven levels of ""therapy"".I gave the product the benefit of the doubt. I have purchased electronics on the web that included cheap batteries as this did and changed the battery--the product performance was the same--terrible!Will be receivingNuFace Microcurrent Toner for Lifting and Toning the Facein the mail soon and can't wait."
3,"Some benefits, but not worth bothering with","I purchased the Neoteric FS-153 to help firm up my complexion, and help eliminate a double chin (I'm 43). I see some benefits, but not enough. The gel you use for conductivity purposes is sticky and goopy, and the device itself is hard to hold and at higher numbers (the higher the number, the tighter the electronic muscle stimulation), the more it hurts! At lower numbers, it feels somewhat pleasant, but when you get up to 6, it really hurts, like being given an electric shock. Actually, I am thinking of sending this product back and going to a reputable plastic surgeon to see about doing something about this double chin. There might be better devices out there for this purpose, but I don't think the FS153 is one of them. Look elsewhere!"
5,This Thing Works!,"I started using this product April 29, 2011 and having used it everyday, I'm Very pleased with the results so far. Under my chin has firmed up dramatically and my slight jowls are receding, Yippeee! Tips for using this product: 1. Give yourself about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to really pay attention to your face while you are using this. 2. Have a mirror in front of you and make sure you're in a comfortable chair. 3. Experiment with the Neoteric, everyones face responds a little differently. I tried moving the device in different areas around the trigger points illustrated in the manual and that's how I found my personal ""power points"" so to speak! Be patient and use it for the full 3 minutes on all trigger points. I felt impatient at first using this but when I look in the mirror and see a more defined face I Want to use it everyday! Tip: I downloaded a free timer for my Nokia smartphone, I set it for three minutes, it buzzes and I'm good to move on to the next spot."
1,Broke after about 10 uses - didn't see any dramatic benefit,"I used this product about 10 times, and the battery went dead. After finally buying and replacing the 9volt, the unit no longer worked...and I was then outside of my return window. All in all, and complete and total waste of money."
3,GREAT WHEN IT WORKS,"Functionality of great when the computer works, but we've had it in the Apple store twice already and now it is broken again, all within 6 months of buying it. The computer will not turn on and this problem is somehow evading the Apple people - it is really a pain in the butt now. Love the machine but will not buy another until hardware quality is better. I do have a Powerbook and a Mac Mini as well, and the Powerbook has given me hardware problems as well. Mac Mini okay so far. Sort of like driving a Jaguar - feels good, looks good, very functional, but you never know when it is about to break down."
3,acorn men's sidekick,"A very comfortable slipper. However, it has worn out on the left toe already and is only 6 months old! NOT A BEST BUY FOR ANYONE!"
3,"Nice, but Overpriced","I ordered these only because I couldn't find any open-toed mens slippers at the local stores I visited. It's entirely too hot down here (south Louisiana) to be wearing snug, toasty winter slippers in August, but that's all anyone seems to sell for some reason.These slides are exactly as advertised: well-made and comfortable. They serve exactly the purpose I needed them for: something to keep me from stepping on my kids' tiny toys in the middle of the night while barefoot (ouch!). But I think the price is a tad on the high side."
2,diferencias entre culturas,"Ese libro nos muestra las cuantiosas maneras en que lo norteamericano diferencia con lo mexicano. Siendo norteamericano, me identifico con Ambrose Bierce y Harriet que llevan sus costumbres y modales en todo momento. ""La búsqueda"" que efectúa el Gringo Viejo es algo que va en contra de las normas de la sociedad y me parece un poco tabú. La forma en que Fuentes escribe no añade nada al contenido ya que sus historias no parecen auténticas. Realmente no recomiendo el libro a los que buscan una diversión; pero sería aconsejable leer el libro si sea un estudiante de la revolución mexicana."
5,sweet!,"well i first herd this band at a concert last year and they were really good performers so i bought their cd. I like it a lot, its good punk plus its christian lyrics so thats a plus. Im gonna go see them again in concert soon and i cant wait. On a side not i swear one of them looks like the guy with the glasses on the movie the sandlot but all grown up.anyone agree?maybe im just weird"
2,Unfortunately....not as fast as everyone says it is.,"Yep, thats right, Broken Cedars' debut album is not near as fast as I keep hearing everyone(including Screaming Giant Records themselves) say it is. There are a couple songs in which Broken Cedars lives up to it's Speed Punk label, and I have to say those tracks are TIGHT. However, after those select few, this album is actually quite slow. All too often the young punkers will start a song that sounds promising at first, but then breaks down like a Ford on the freeway. Yeah, they definately have talent. But I can only hope and pray they figure out the formula that bands like Blink 182 and Slick Shoes have for making quality albums. Better luck next time Broken Cedars."
3,Has some problems,"This system came preloaded with windows vista, which sucks. Also, it keeps dropping wireless connectivity regularly."
3,Es un buen computador de trabajo,"Es un buen computador de trabajo, no lo recomiendo para jugar.Esta máquina funciona mejor con Windows XP."
1,acer notebooks are terrible!,"i have purchased two acer notebooks. on the first, the lcd screen failed after about three months.the repair department was horrible to deal with, and ultimately would not repair their product.do NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT buy an acer product unless you like dealing with failure."
1,Learn to get rid of your addictions!,"With this simple book you can learn to1. Get rid of your addiction to food2. Get rid of your addiction to water3. eventually get rid of you addiction to breathing4. get rid of your addiction to being a sentient being and just become one with the earth, literally5. end your own guilibilty. PERMENTLY6. line this womans' pockets and a coffin at the same time."
1,Misguided,"I believe this book is for the completely lost and wandering souls that need some desperate attempt for guidance. If the author is so spiritually aware, then why does she bleach her hair? Think about it."
1,Stupidity,"Okay come on people. Living on Light? I'm just curious on how stupid the human race is going to get. I mean you must not be the brightest crayon in the box if you starve your self doing what is the ""in"" thing to do. Already 3 people have died in result from it. How many more until they get this book off the bookshelves? This is pure nonsence."
1,This book teaches that you do not have to eat,"I have never read this book but I don't like it. In case you missed it, its premise is that you don't need to eat or drink to live. That is incorrect information."
1,0 stars,remember the heaven's gate people that killed themselves and thought they were going to some comet or something in the sky? this book is for people like that.
3,Keeping Open to Possibilities,"I found this book truly enjoyable, probably because my work involves energy medicine. I am a practitioner of Oriental Medicine and other energetic modalities, with healing results that amaze even me. All matter is energy slowed down; Einstein taught us that. So working with energy can have a profound effect on the physical body. This book is not as far-fetched as many critics have declared. There have been cases of people who survived famine on faith, and others (Tibetan monks in prison for example) who have lived for years without food, sustained apparently by prayer and meditation. I would like to see more documentation to support this book, maybe in the form of a documentary film following the 21 day initiation period and beyond. The concept of living on energy intrigues me tremendously. I believe it is possible, but I need more back up evidence before I take the leap myself."
1,Living with rocks for brains,"Who published this? Seriously? ....Seriously. Because if they'll publish this, maybe they'll consider my book about The True Life Story of Santa Claus or 50 Ways to Trim Your Toenails with a Spoon."
1,Read the five-star reviews,"Read the five-star reviews for some good fun. A lot of them are one-star reviews in disguise, and they're a riot! The work of this charlatan appears to be an effort to see just how far you can go to separate the fools from their money."
5,Cosmic Riddle Uncovered,"I had to read this book carefully before I discovered the true message contained therein. If you trust your feelings and randomly pick a page, and then stare at the center of it with your inner eye long enough, you can slowly see the words form:NO MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE IT, IT'S STILL BALONEY!"
4,Priviledged to have met the author.,"I know this book presents an almost unbelievable way of living, but I was at a presentation by the author and was swept away with her sincerity. She was well aware of the skeptics and only presented her personal experiences and views. She emphasized how tough it was to stay with this way of living in the face of all the social pressures and attitudes around food. This was a spiritual journey for her. By the way, she looked very wholesome and vibrant, not gaunt and skinny. The picture on the book doesn't do justice to her real world presence and radiance."
5,Accelerated learning for anyone seeking truth!,"Hooray! Jasmuheen's Living on Light is finally available in the United States! I discovered her on the web over a year ago, and it took me many months and a miracle to obtain a copy of this book! Now, it is readily available to all of us! Living on Light will most certainly take the dedicated spiritual seeker to a higher level of intention, followed by application. Even if you aren't ready to be sustained by prana, this book will help you set your vision and begin to apply that which will easily lead to being nourished by the ultimate nutrient -- Light. Thank you Jasmuheen for the willingness to be the first one of our generation, and for sharing your results."
1,Please seek help,If you are vulnerable enough to actually consider following the 'advice' in this book please get help as you evidently have some sort of suicidal tendencies. I can't believe this woman hasn't been sued by someone yet. Or has she? Anyway she's a dangerous charlatan. Your body is made of matter. You need matter to keep it going.
1,"These only work with Bosch ""Closed End"" wiper blades","I bought these thinking they were the normal Bosch wiper blade refills which I've used for years on countless cars with normal metal wiper blade frames which I now know are called ""open ended."" In the listing, they show you the teeny pic of two wiper blades. What they don't show is the box which has a big red circle with a diagonal line through it and a picture of regular wiper blade frames and bold red print saying, ""Only for use with Bosch Closed End Wiper Blades. Not For Use On Open Ended Wiper Blades."" Darn...Fortunately amazon.com customer service did a nice job as usual. I just wish they would be a little more careful with their listing text. If you look up the model number on the Bosch site (which I did before purchasing), nothing comes up."
3,DONT BE FOOLED,"Dont be fooled by the Digital format of this book. Its only 7 pages long, a summary of the full version. I downloaded, and was very disappointed to find it to be a summary instead of the full version."
2,OK....,DIFFICULT TO PUSH DOWN ON THE SYRINGE. MESSY. HOLDS FAIRLY WELL ON THE PROPER ITEMS . I WILL LOOK FOR A BETTER WAY--TOO MUCH WASTED DUE TO DIFFICULT SYRINGE.
5,Very inspirational!,"I purchased this book several years ago. I have always loved the song, ""Shout to the Lord."" It will always hold a special place in my heart because of Amy Newhouse. I never hear the song that I don't remember Amy and think of her and her love for the Lord.When I saw that the book was dedicated to Amy, I had to buy it (bought a couple). Our little town was changed by Amy, whether you knew her personally, or you just knew of her . . . you were changed. The Lord continues to use Amy's story to touch the lives of people. A movie about her is supposed to be coming soon, ""A Greater Yes.""This book tells several other stories of inspiration. They are all good, but none more touching than the story of Amy Newhouse."
1,US ROBOTICS FAX MODEM,"Modem would not power up when connected. ANTOline would not replace it or refund my money. In the meantime I had to buy another modem. Still trying to deal with US Robotics. Obviously, I would never buy this modem or purchase anything from ANTOline again. 2 MONTHS LATER AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY SATISFACTION FROM US ROBOTICS, ANTOLNIE OR AMAZON."
5,Best pig's ears,"The size, texture and quality of these pig's ears are great. I was buying mine at Costco and they were getting smaller and oilier. These are much better quality and my two labs love them."
3,Half-hearted CD Release,"This album was originally released as a double LP; then re-released as 2 single LPs: Sons and Fascination & Sister Feelings Call. Unfortunately, the music company decided to release this as a single CD, thus requiring them to cut 3 tracks from Sister Feelings Call. Since Sister Feelings Call was my favorite LP, I'm disappointed. I wish they would remaster it & re-release it as a double-CD w/ all the tracks. However, the songs that are on the CD are great stuff."
4,Pretty good,"This was my first vibrator, and it was a little wide for my taste. I would recommend a skinnier one if you are first trying out sex toys. But, it has many good qualities. It is very bendable, and that really makes it feel more natural. The jelly is soft and the bumps on it give an added effect. Just a side note, this does not come with batteries. Overall, this is a very good product."
3,larger than expected,"Purchased this for my girlfriend. This one is very thick, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The tip is soft and the middle flexes. My girlfriend was intimidated by it, so haven't done anything with it at all, even putting batteries in."
2,"Okay, but there are better books out there","If you get this book, do so for one of two reasons:1)You want entertaining tidbits about weird stuff2)You already own everything else Randi's writtenThis book simply pales in comparison the the Skeptic's Dictionary (available free online) when it comes to debunking a wide range of paranormal claims. In fact, I'm not sure if there's any good debunking in there. If you want to read about the akashic memory and various forms of flat-earthism, this books if for you. I suppose its nice to have someone who can provide entertaining tidbits in a non-credulous manner, but I wonder it would be better just to buy a believer's encyclopedia and ignore the fact that the author believes the things he's talking about."
1,All Mr. Randi doesn't believe in is fraud,"My initial interest in this book dimmed greatly when I readthat expert Mr. Randi attributes the grimoire ""Necronomicon""- an invention of 19th century fantasy writer H.P.Lovecraft - to a real 8th century author and speaks of a 16th century translation by Dr. John Dee. Similar blunders follow, such as the notion the Jehovas Witnesses faith was based on calculations of the Great Pyramid. Among the ""hoaxes and frauds"" Mr. Randi debunks along with the Unicorn and the Abominable Snowman are the Bible, Eastern medicine (acupuncture, acupressure and shiatsu), the faith of the Jehovas Witnesses and the Mormons and, of course, Parapsychology. Debunking is done by poking fun at them via short, sneering comments. The book had better be titled: ""An encyclopedia of all the things Mr. Randi does not believe in."" For the serious student it is almost worthless."
2,James Randi- a man of faith,"After reading this book, I realized that Mr. Randi and many like him are as faith-based as the people they debunk, ignoring all evidence that fails to match the required result. Scientism and rationalism, in Mr. Randi's case anyway, are in fact deeply held, emotionally driven beliefs, like so much of what he rightly attacks.There's much out there in the way of easy targets for Mr. Randi's rationalism; I simply would prefer he also turn the ""dogs of doubt"" on themselves every now and again. He debunks everything except the religion of rationalism- his own sacred cow."
4,A must read,"With all the mindless new age claims and so-called paranormal tripe being uncritically accepted by a naive public, James Randi has done a great service in writing this excellent and enjoyable book. While Randi is bound to upset some, this book is a first rate source of information about crop circles, channeling, Kirilan photorgaphy, dowsing, and other assorted tripe. I would recommend this as required reading for all interested in occult claims. My only complant is that many of the entries and too short and insufficiently developed. Greg Klebanoff, Ph.D. philosophy"
1,Disappointing,"There is a lot of misinformation in this book. Many points he tries to make in this book are based on inaccuracies which does nothing to support his case. And although he does do a good job attempting to expose the hoaxes out there, someone that knows better wouldn't wonder if this book is not a hoax itself."
3,An Antidote for Gullibility,"James ""The Amazing"" Randi does not have much good to say about the charlatans who pedal their supernatural wares before the public. Unlike the books written by the credible, Randi provides many valuable accounts of how famous seers and magicians have hoodwinked the public.Randi's research is sometimes flawed and his accounts sketchy, which leads me to reduce the rating I give for this book. For example, he does not realize that the Necronomicon was a Twentieth Century invention of horror author H.P. Lovecraft and he falsely implicates Increase Mather as a proponent of the Salem Witchcraft trials. (Increase was off in England when the whole thing started and was shocked to find it underway upon his return.) He is also coy about revealing details of certain trade secrets used by stage magicians and bunko spiritualists. These flaws detract from an otherwise marvellous and valuable reference."
4,Shame about the over-sarcastic tone,"Let me state from the beginning that I am a real Randi fan. Every week I can't wait to read his update...and I absolutely agree with all of his skeptic positions.Yet, as I read this book, I was seriously annoyed about the over-sarcastic tone he uses so often. Many times it's like he's trying to go for overkill with a ""witty remark"", but doing so he really adds nothing to the book. Worse than that, he comes off as a rabid, sometime overemotional basher of irrationalists everywhere. This really backfires when one wants to show this book to some delusional folk to help him/her get a grip on reality - haters aren't really good teachers.Also, the book is poorly edited. Typos abound, and Randi couldn't get right an Italian name/word if his life depended on it. Being Italian myself, I might be partial about this, but traits like those don't belong to serious research as he is actually doing."
3,"A Good Primer, But Little Else","I was actually disappointed in this book, as it is almost strictly a glossary, not an encyclopedia. For the Randi completist only. For a better summary of Randi's skeptical debunking, read FLIM-FLAM or THE TRUTH ABOUT URI GELLAR."
3,Nice,"This is a very nice stroller, I got it for around $100.00. If I had paid more though, I would not have kept it. The buckling system is very difficult and not user friendly. The five point harness has a lot of threading and what not and therefore is not easy to use. Not the best buckling system out there and could use fixing. Otherwise, it is a very nice stroller."
3,Average quality stroller,"The stroller is average quality. The material feels and sounds like paper. Enough storage in the back seats and the bottom and I really love that fact that it is lightweight (only 23 lbs). However, no front wheel swivel which makes it difficult on the turns. Amazon's delivery was awesome (in 1 day)!"
5,Nice juicer!,I've had this juicer for the longest time and didn't use it because the first thing I used to make juice with it was celery and it was a real mess. But lately I've been using it every day to make orange juice and it's great! It comes out so yummy and the clean-up is easy. Orange and strawberry juice is out of this world.
3,Not one of her best,"I've read most of Kathleen Harrington books and I've totally loved her writing but this one in my opinion was just an average romance. It was a little too tedious (about mining & law) and you basically knew where the plot was going from the first page. The plusses about this book is that the relationship between the two main characters was very intense and totally hot! The main characters, all other characters and the little town of Butte were so well written that i could just picture it so well in my mind, just like you're there. You should read this if you're a fan of her writing, but if this is the first Kathleen Harrington book you want to pick up I'd suggest ""The Dream Catcher"" (my favorite by this author)."
1,This one's a whiskey ...,This was one of the worst books I have ever forced myself to complete (actually haven't completed the task yet). I am not surprised that most of the people referred to in the book would not allow Hemphill to use their names. He sounds like a nightmare in the jungle. His arrogant and pompous attitude came through loud and clear. I have friends who were in Vietnam; one whom was in the same area during Tet and none of them talk about their experience in this manner.
4,RX FOR THE BLUES,"This album is from another title ""Taking Flight"" or ""Greatest Hits"" and through research these songs are from Big John's Live in Chicago 1963-64. These songs are great!!! Michael Bloomfield was indeed a super guitar player!! I would recommend this album to any Michael Bloomfield fan who is searching for early stuff from this guitar legend."
1,"This is not really a toy, it's more for display.","I bought this for my son, who is almost 6 and he liked to pretend to fly it around. It is quite heavy for it's size but one of the plastic pieces on the underside broke off. It looks great and comes with a stand. I'd say it is suited more for a display piece and not a toy."
1,It is Not a Toy,"It feels strong and is heavy- however, the stand is flimsy and broke almost right away. My son then dropped it and the nose broke off. I figured diecast would be strong enough for him to play with but it is not. Do not buy this if you or your child will want to play with it."
4,Almost perfect,"The almost here is because the one I received came with some of its 4 tail fins with the yellow paint somewhat ""blurred"". But hey, look at what it costs...In comparison with another dozens of ""Model Power"" brand aircraft models I own, this one is worth for its rarity, though, even its accuracy and assembly (nose cone) not being a forte."
4,Edmond White talks about famous people he has known,"A very literate book. Not for someone looking for a light read or an entertaining read. This is serious stuff. Probably best read by English teachers, etc."
1,clinique imitation,"I have been using this moisturizer for two years now.Recently i bought it from the above store and found out it was a fake.First and foremost this moisturizer is fragrance free,but the one i bought online from this store has a minty scent,and the feel is different.Please buy clinique from a reputable store even if you have to pay more."
2,Not for sensitive skin!,"I have sensitive skin and my skin is also always flaky and dry. I decided to purchase this product because I read some good reviews about the ingredients and how light it is. After using it for the first time my skin started to break out. I keep using it because I was pretty sure it wasn't this product but my face just keeps getting breakouts. I decided to stop using this moisturizer and my blemishes went away. If you do decide to try this product, I would suggest putting only a little bit on one side of your face and see what happens. I know a lot of people say that you can test it by using on the neck and behind the ears but I've found that the pores on the face reacts differently so try it out first."
5,Baby smooth!,"Words cannot describe this moisturizer,but I will give it a shot anyway. It goes on creamy and cool. Once I get it rubbed in, my face feels luxorious and silky. When I put it on, after using my mild Clinique cleanser and toner at night, the silkiness lasts all night and into the morning when it's time to begin my morning regimine. This moisturizer even keeps a clean silky feeling underneath my makeup all day. I have oily skin and have never found a product like this that keeps me moisturized, yet clean feeling all day and night."
2,I am very upset with my purchase,"I am very upset with my purchase (Clinique cream ""All about eyes rich"" and Clinique ""Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel"") which I've bought from Laptop-Services in April 2011. The both (cream and gel) I've got unpacked. I think Laptop-Services must pay more attention how the treatments they send to customers are packed! Unfortunately I am not happy with my purchase; I think I'll never buy treatments using Laptop-Services."
5,Recomendaciòn,"Producto de belleza que tiene varios elementos para ser recomendado, de excelente calidad, se absorbe inmediatamente, no deja sensación grasosa"
1,Oh my god,"It has been almost two months now since I ordered this product, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. I have tried to contact the seller several times now and they still give this this weird email asking if I still want this product. They have already taken my money out of my account and are now asking me if I still want to get this delivered to my place? Are you kidding? I am so peased now. People should not buy this product here. I don't know if it's a good one but I know that you will never be able to review and comment about the quality of the product if you order it here."
1,Highly disappointing,This moisturizer was recommended to me; I have very dry facial skin. This is not the right product for someone with dry facial skin.
1,Grande joke,"This book is accessed from the mini horse section.It shows no mini horses.Other than the mini size of the book (not the price) it has no connection with mini horses.For that reason it is a big joke.If you like full size horses, fine.If you like mini horses, pass."
1,Horribly uncomfortable,"The underwires on both sides of the bra hve poked through the fabric, and the bare metal stabs like a knife. Very disappointing. I usually like Olga braa, but not this one."
4,Condiment Dispenser satisfaction,"Delivery was faster than expected. Dispenser perform exactly the way we needed it to. The dispensers are easy to store. Nothing is perfect, though. There were no tops for the spouts."
2,Good for your little 'Tom Sawyer',"This is by no means a great recording. It does, however, offer both kids and parents a chance to listen to something they can both enjoy. The CD is a soundtrack companion to the animated film of the same name, and is very country influenced. I would recomend this CD for adults and children together, but that's pretty much where it stops."
5,Mr. Ed videos,I bought the Mr. Ed videos to share with my horseless 4H kids. They absolutely love to watch them! I love to share something that I grew up watching!
5,luv it,"was well priced and luv it, watchit and others everyday. going to order all of them,and all the oldies. it was deliverd super fast also."
4,Mr. ED finally in season set form!!!,"I loved watching Mr. ED on Nick at Nite in the late 80's and early 90's when I was a kid. Now after the Best OF sets we get the First Season of the show and its Great! It still holds up as did in the 60's and when i first saw it in the late 80's. Great show and great cast! If you like sticoms, you should add Mister ED to your collection!!!"
5,Great watching Mister Ed again,"I bought this so my Grand-daughters could watch it. I kept telling them about this show I watched as a child , they love it"
5,Many happy hours for my horse crazy granddaughter.,"Great, clean family fun and nice memories for me. My mother enjoys watching the episodes with her great-granddaughter, too. The quality of the video is very good, including sound."
4,SURPRISE!!!!,"I purchased this album a few weeks ago and I must say that there was some surprise listening to it. With names like Faithless, Soma Sonic and Moby I expected entirely cool downtempo vibes, but found the CD moreso had a very mellow, contemporary New Age sound. What a pleasant surprise!! So if you are a fan of New Age / World Music then this is for you. My favorite downtempo tracks are Moby ""Rushing"", Soma Sonic ""Blueskies"" and Faithless ""The Garden"". On the New Age / World tip I'm digging almost everything on the CD....Ronan Hardiman ""Love Song"", Thomas Newman ""Lunch With The King"", Phobos ""Soul Of Desire"", Balligomingo ""Lost"", Govinda ""Aspetta"", Yasue ""Peaceful Village"" and Ikarus ""Bassment""....Great!! Can't wait for the next volume!"
2,The Kindle version is missing scene breaks,"The kindle version is missing scene breaks which makes it really annoying to read. In the ""middle"" of a paragraph it starts following a new thread on a different part of the planet.The actual story is OK--but not wonderful."
4,"""Roddenberry and Hammerstein?""","Yup, just like I said. There are actually songs in there, sung by the characters, integral to the plot. As I read the lyrics, I was mentally putting a tune to them, but it was a ripoff of a dozen Broadway songs I'd heard. If this book is never reissued by Simon & Schuster, author John Ford ought to get in touch with a competent show tune composer and actually do it as a musical. It would actually draw a fair-sized audience."
3,Humor...The Final Frontier.,"One of the great vehicles that Star Trek used to convey a story is humor. ""A Piece Of The Action"", ""Star Trek IV"" used humor appropriately and sparingly in their story. Yet, in Ford's ""How Much For Just The Planet?"" I find the humor to be mundane or almost ""British."" Pie fights in Star Trek? Yep. Is it funny? Matter of opinion I guess, but I found the humor in a pie fight lacking. I really don't think slapstick humor in Trek suits very well. This is humor that you'd see in a 3 Stooges episode, not Trek. Only redeeming factor that I enjoyed from the book is the Federation survey team that crash lands on the planet. I'm glad to see that not every starship, no matter what size, has access to holodecks (yeah I know pre-generation), rec-decks, and libraries. The boredom that the crew was suffering from was protrayed nicely from the author. Best that Trek has to offer? No, but definitely not the worst."
3,"Not the best Trek novel ever, but not bad.","I really enjoyed John M. Ford's ""The Final Reflection,"" so I thought I'd like this one, too. First of all, it's a Trek comedy, for lack of a better phrase. Although it's an okay story, it's not up to the same level as his other Trek novel. Order it if you liked ""The Final Reflection."""
3,Entertaining,"This book had been so highly recommended to me for so long that I finally bit the bullet and decided to dive into it.Well it's not the best book I've read, but it's head and shoulders above most other Star Trek novels. This book is humorous (I especially enjoyed the paranoid shipboard computer...hilarious) but the humor is downright silly. As a previous reviewer noted, the pie fight scene is one where I screwed up my face and kept reading. It seemed to belong more in a Three Stooges movie than a Star Trek book.Several of the 'humorous' situations are forced, but there's enough good stuff in there to keep you entertained for the entirety of a fairly brief novel."
3,Slapstick Star Trek,"Star Trek novels are not intended to be great literature. They are quick reads and enjoyable diversions. ""How Much for Just the Planet"" captures the fun and campiness of the original Star Trek television series, with a fair amount of Gilbert and Sullivan absurdity mixed in. Unfortunately there is no seriousness or supsense to provide respite from the general goofiness.Author John M. Ford is creative, but I had great difficulty keeping his characters straight. The familiar Star Trek characters are of course easy to follow, but the rest of the cast is another matter entirely. The characters are one-dimensional and not clearly defined, the plot lines don't intercut swiftly enough, and the Klingons each have formal names and nicknames which are used interchangeably.""How Much for Just the Planet"" is not the worst of the Star Trek novels, but it's not one of the best either."
1,One of the worst,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read, and I have read everything.It fails both as a star trek novel and a novel in general.It tries to be funny, but fails misurably.Exept maybe for a certain part where the absolutely pathetic American TV-shop commercials, that are clearly directed to peole who cannot count from 1 to 5 are made fun of, wich is quite cratifying.But unfortunately that's it.If you respect star trek, don't read this book at any cost. It has nothing intellectually or entertainingly challenging to offer."
4,"halfway through. Great book, exasperating writing",Just wanted to leave a quick review...This book ofcourse is a result of great amount of research and creative ideas. But this book needs to be edited to remove some of the digressions that do not add to the discussion and archaic words and style and repetitions that is confusing and annoying to read. Also it can be written in a much engaging style. I would give 5* if not for the bad writing
5,Awe inspiring,"The fact that the laws which Kauffman seeks and explains in this book are merely theories that are yet to be proven is not the issue which would make Darwinists nervous here. Rather it is the fact that materialist's contemporary theories such as natural selection simply fall short of explaining the species of the natural world - hence theories such as Kauffman's are necessarily being sought after.In his books 'The Origins of Order' and 'At Home in the Universe', Kauffman has done more than anyone else to supply the key missing piece for self-organization that can join the random and the deterministic forces of evolution into a satisfactory theory of life's order.Unfortunately, the said key piece happens to make the theistic view more plausible than the Neo-Darwinists' view. For this reason, not everyone will wish to accompany Kauffman, but the description of the trip is significant, and should not be ignored."
4,My first exposure to the topic,"This book is written from a biological perspective, which is not where my interests lie. Perhaps if my background were different, I would have given it an additional star.The greatest benefit I received from this book was exposure to a whole new subject area (self organization). After reading the book, I moved on to read several other books about emergent behaviour which is more along the lines of my interests.It served me well to open my eyes to a different way of thinking. The other books I have read have served me better as they are not primarily biologically based."
4,There is a superb book hiding inside it!,"Other reviewers already sang praises to the concepts and the ideas contained ni this book, and I have nothing to add other than my agreement. BUT! The book would have been improved no end by some ruthless editing. The opening chapters in particular are immensely repetitive. The style is very uneven, sometimes apparently aiming at readers with no technical knowledge (and a miniscule attention span), while in other places packing ideas to such density that even a fairly informed reader can start gasping for breath.I made the mistake of reading it on holidays, with no access to a computer. Big mistake! I kept wanting to program, to check out what the author was saying, to try variants and elaborations. I.e. to have lots of hands-on fun -- it's that sort of a book and I can think of no higher recommendation. But please, oh please, somebody introduce Kaufman to a good editor!"
5,Excellent new vision of evolution of life and society,This book explores how life and its evolution may be the inevitable consequences of the way the universe works. The author uses recent explorations of computer models of complexity to uncover new ideas about the organization of systems. These ideas extend well beyond biology to application to social and market systems
2,Verbose,"I didn't get far into the book. I could not get past the verbosity. It remined me of writers from the 19 century. Get to the point. If there was a take-away idea from that long introductory chapter, I missed it. Pity, looks interesting."
4,A good book,"I 've got some interesting ideas. However, some chapters exploit much of the recurring theme and are boring."
4,Fascinating ideas,"This book has some really fascinating ideas - new ways to look at evolution and complex systems (or at least, new to me). Also it describes some cool computational experiments that motivate the biological theory pretty well.My one gripe is that he gets off on philosophical tangents too much - I think ever since Godel Escher Bach, science writers have tried to be poets and philosophers also and it just gets in the way. I found myself skipping big chunks that looked like fluff."
1,More Chaos-Psycho Babble,"Yet another example of misguided musings emanating from the Santa Fe Institute ( let's apply ""Chaos"" theory to pop subject matter and sell it to the masses!...Who cares if it lacks any credibility ??! !) His writings about the implications of chaos and random selection on the ""evolutionary process"" are not only silly, but distorted and just plain wrong. If one is interested in some real research, check out William Hamilton or John Maynard Smith."
1,Pure Guesswork,"In spite of overwhelning evidence that seems to point in the other direction, Kauffman tries to paint a picture of man's belonging to the universe. A short glance at the history of mankind gives no support to the idea, on the contrary. There's also no real evidence in Kauffman's book, only a lot of wishful thinking. It's more like a long poem than it is science. Many great philosophers go in the opposite direction of Kauffman. Jean-Paul Sartre says: The person who thinks that man has a nature gets him mixed up with a cauliflower head. Kauffman does precisely that."
1,Heap of rubbish,This book is based on ridiculous assumptions and simply ignoring complete branches of science. Few examples:1) It assumes that the probability of a molecule to catalyze a reaction is 1 in million. Any biochemist tell you that is nonsense.2) Every cell bilogist will tell you that Kauffman discussion of cell cycle is plain nonsense.3) Kauffman puysicst can tell you that kauffman idas are in contardiction to thermodynamics laws.
4,her 'voice',"fun book, lots of good info. like that she doesn't step on people, blame others, etc. a good winter read."
3,Sometimes one buys a wrong book,"I bought this book because of those five stars it got. I have seen His Girl Friday and it was a great film. I was seeking a book which tells a lot about films and making them, but I do not care about American theater or rich or famous people or beautiful clothes or Frank Sinatra. Rosalind Russell was abviously a sensible person and did not make any scandals, which is great. Some stories were good, but some parts like the chapter about Sinatra I skipped over. Thus my evaluation reflects my taste. This was not nearly so much a film book I hoped."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This item has very little memory foam inside and provides no relief whatsoever. In fact, the lack of padding actually caused more hand pain than I had before using it. So, bottom line - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Also has cheap plastic-feeling seams which scratch the hand."
3,"Some good stuff, but far from mindblowing","DO It Again and Reelin' In the Years are definetly the best tunes, plus I'm a fan of Dirty Work, Kings and Turn That Heartbeat Over Again. The rest drifts from average (Only a Fool Would Say That, Change of the Guards, Fire in the Hole) to bad (Brooklyn, Midnite Cruiser, the latter featuring drummer Jim Hodder unwisely taking lead vocals). Steely Dan made some great records, but Can't Buy a Thrill isn't one of them - check out Countdown to Ecstasy, Pretzel Logic or The Royal Scam instead."
5,Excellent,"Next to the Doors, Zappa and Hendrix, this must be the greatest debut of history. Awesome music, excellently played. It set the pattern for albums to come, which would become even more sophisticated.This album is essential for any serious lover of modern music, with a penchant for the 70's. Songwriters go chic!"
2,Not their best,This is a period piece. The songs that made the charts are the only reasons to buy this one. Some of the other lyrics to the non-mainstream songs have typical 70's lyrics and sound (the bad 70's!!!) I love Steely Dan but not this CD. Buy A Decade of Steely Dan instead. You'll thank me for this advice.
2,just average,might be an ok book if you lived in the areanot useful for out of towners - hikes not too interestingmore popular and too spread out to be useful.
4,101 Hikes in Southen California,"Bought it for our Son and Wife who live and do a lot of hiking, camping in Southern California. . . .Lots of wonderful Hikes and information about same; I enjoyed reading it and I'm sure ( from the feedback from my son and his wife) they have enjoyed it also. . . Well written.JLQ"
4,Great book,"This is a great hiking book for hikers of all levels. The book details each hike and the information is quite accurate. The only negative is the lack of colored photos. And because of all the details listed in each page, it could be tiresome to follow what you're reading. It could be more reader friendly."
4,Helpful and organized,"I bought this to locate potential hikes near my home in Dana Point. I had hoped it would address the issue of bringing a dog along. Although the info is well organized and well written, there is never a single mention about hiking with a dog. Some areas permit this and others do not, so I feel this would have been a helpful addition. I have done only one of the hikes so far and it was accurately represented in this book."
1,Monrovia Canyon Park missing,"This is a terrific book, but I don't give it 5 stars because it does not have Monrovia Canyon Park, which has a very easy hike to a 30-foot waterfall and is great for all ages."
3,Want it in digital Google Earth format,"Have viewed this book at REI and it is good for paper reference.However, before I will buy this book, I wish this author and others would start including a disc in their hiking books with the trails in Google Earth KML format, so people can view and mark/measure locations on the marked hikes. Would be easier to find and view listed parking areas, points of interest, drinking fountain/restroom locations, elevation changes, views from trail, streams, trail junctions, plants, lookouts, ranger stations, closed areas;etc. This is not that hard to do. I am hoping it will be included in the next edition."
2,SPICE WINE,This mixture of spices is not worth the money. Between the spices and the wine you have to buy....you could create your own warm wine receipe with honey/cloves and cinanaman out of your own pantry
2,Product description is WRONG!!!,"The product description for this product is wrong. I was expecting to mix my ingredients, put them in the machine, turn it on, and have ice cream in 20 minutes. Instead, I must freeze the ice cream receptacle in the freezer for 6 to 22 hours before I can make ice cream. I am very disappointed with this product. It does make good ice cream, but is very inconvenient to use, and the 1 1/2 quart capacity makes enough ice cream only for 2 or 3 people."
1,Cuisinart ICE-25 is a piece of junk,The first time I made ice cream with the Cuisinart ICE-25 the mix only partially froze and the ice cream was inedible. The second time I tried to make ice cream the paddle seized up and broke the plastic stops on the cover. This product is a cheaply made overpriced piece of junk. It is a rip off of the Donvier hand cranked design that work will for me. Don't buy this product. The Cuisinart name is now mud and I will never buy their products again.
3,"Noisy, noisy, noisy!","This machine is extremely noisy - which is not that unusual for ice cream makers, but only makes so-so ice cream, yogurt and sorbet. The consistency is consistently poor.Consider it a pricey novelty, not a small appliance you will want to use. I have my doubts about the longevity of the mixing blade, which is a very flimsy plastic piece. The rest of the unit is of more solid construction."
4,O Brave New World That has Such People In it.,"The Tempest is thought to be Shakespeare's final play. As such there is much in it that calls to mind earlier works. To me the Tempest is reminiscent of A MidSummers Night Dream. The themes of separation, betrayal and forgiveness and restoration are prominent. It is relatively short but contains summation of themes that are found throughout Shakespeare's works.I have always enjoyed the Folger Library edition of the plays. The use of explanatory notes on the facing pages is incredibly helpful and allows the narrative to be followed with out the need to page back and forth when a phrase requires a quick refresher. If you are looking to find a well edited and accessible paperback version of the Tempest I highly recommend this one."
3,Virtue over vengeance,"Many things about this play are fantastical: its compressed timeframe, the plot-moving presence of so many monsters and spirits, the mystical island location, and Prospero's status as both an abused hero and a slave-driving villain. Without the fantastical elements, the plot begs disbelief, as several emotionally strong and contradictory events take place within a single afternoon: Prospero carries out his years-in-the-making revenge fantasy yet also pardons his betrayers and gives up his magic; Sebastian both forms and then gives up his plan to murder his brother the king. Of course there is a happy ending involving a marriage and escape from exile, demonstrating that while ""The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance,"" virtue wins out in the end."
2,"Ok if you're are reading for entertainment, terrible for school!","It is a great copy of the book in the sense that it's inexpensive and it's not bulky at all and it's great if you are reading for entertainment. The problem being is that THERE IS NO LINE NUMBERS! I bought this copy to use for school, and it is impossible to keep up with the teacher mainly because there is no line numbers at all! Also, a lesser issue is that no where on the page does it tell you what Act/Scene it is. So if you're looking for a copy to use at home for ""fun"" reading this is it. But if you want to use it in any class, DON'T NOT BUY THIS COPY."
3,Does not have notes like other reviewers have stated,"This edition is NOT the Folger Edition that has notes and definitions like the other reviewers have stated! It is just the text. I bought this for a class based on the reviews and was very disappointed. If you want the Folger Edition that these reviews are talking about, click on the link above their review. I now have to buy a different edition for the notes!!! Waste of money!!!"
4,GREAT!,"This is a great CD that can really turn up the gas in your fire for God! From fast paced to slow and smooth, WOW Orange gives us any kind of music we're looking for. It's great, though I don't like it as good as the first, but once I start getting to know the songs better I'll love it! A must buy for any one who loves God and wants music to praise him all in one package!"
4,WOW (orange),"I found that this cd wasn't that bad. I was looking for praise songs that I knew, and songs that sounded good... and this had both of them. I know that one guy/girl said there was loud screamy guitar things, but I didn't really think so. The music, to me, makes me feel like I'm there. It pumps me up for God!... and that's what I want!"
4,A Great Worship CD,"Though this CD has lots of my favourite songs on it, like Rock of Ages, In the Secret, Better is One Day, and As the Deer, it definately does not meet the expectations of a predecessor to WoW Worship Blue. Though I like any songs that praise Jesus and my God, it does not have the bang that the first one had. Don't get me wrong - it is a great CD to have in your collection - but if you are a newcomer and want a GREAT worship CD, get WoW Worship Blue."
4,Good New Praise Songs,"Besides Jesus Lover of My Soul, We Want to See Jesus Lifted High, and In The Secret, the songs on Disc 1 are new to me. But, that's okay. Disc 1 is high energy compared to more mellow and meditative Disc 2. That makes it perfect for pulling up to the guys with the bass pulsating out their subwoofers and giving them something else loud to listen to. Disc 2 provides material that's easier to incorporate into worship and to give expression to God's immanence. For those looking for a few good tunes with theologically rich lyrics, Better is One Day is very scriptural. Redeemer, Savior, Friend, is sound."
4,Great Live Compilation,"Great live selections from the original lineup (and the live 'Ot & Sweaty' from the second lineup minus McCarty and Day).When the original lineup was 'on' they made some magical music. This compilation is from three shows from the original lineup and the second lineups live set off of the fourth Cactus album (which is nice, but not the original and it shows).Very enjoyable set - I was lucky enough to get this new when it was released. You have to be a REAL fan to pay the prices noted here.Bits of this were released on the second Fully Unleashed (which is an entire show from 6/26/71)."
5,"Great products, great prices!","Well, I bought 8 diff. items and all of them arrived in time and in good condition.Regarding shipping charges ...I almost went away from this shop after having seen the shipping charge > $ 7.94But I'm glad I realized the charge isn't per item.Means, I did not pay 8 times $ 7.94 for shipping, I paid one time $ 7.94 only for all eight different ! items."
3,Prepare yourself for the smell,"Don't get the idea that you're going to eat a tablespoon of these everyday with your ABCDE vitamins. Figure out your plan. Everything in moderation, including moderation."
3,Bought saw good for digestive health,"Not bad tasting, very small seeds, healthwise no change. Has a slight minty flavor, so my breath was fresh :)"
4,like it,"More Caraway seeds than I really needed, shared with friends. Product was good. Came just like described and very promptly."
5,Best buy out there,Love caraway seed in soups and stews. Great price for a fresh large quanity that I can afford. I pinch pennies where I can but will not give up on quality to do so. So I highly reccommend this for you cooking also. You will return again and again. Great Amazon seller.
2,seeds are not for me,"I purchased the caraway seeds after looking at a Dr. Oz show on healthy alternatives to prescription medications. Caraway seeds may be the newest thing per Dr. Oz, but I tried a teaspoon of them and they tasted so bad I was unable to eat them. Maybe I misunderstood the directions, but acid reflux is much better than the caraway seeds."
2,"Caraway Seed, YUCK !!","I purchased this item to help with bloating and eat it directly from the jar. Product has a strong odor and doesn't seem to be easily edible. There is no significant taste, but it is not something you can just munch on and feel comfortable like sesame seeds for example. Sorry I purchased it, probably it is much more useful as a seasoning."
2,SICK TO THE STOMACH,"DOCTOR OZ said this was good stuff and would quell stomach aches containing gas. Well I ate a small handful as he said to do, and an hour later I retched and double over from stomach pains and developed rectal bleeding. This was the last time I took his advice and discontinued recording his show on my cable box. Beware, your'e on your own folks."
3,"Good Tool, but limited","This looks like it will be a useful tool for doing my draft this year, but the league settings are limited. For example, we draft a defense as one of our players and this isn't an option in this software. We also deduct points for missed field goals and this also is not an option. One item that would seem to be a 'no-brainer' is to include a player's bye week, useful in helping to not load up on too many players with the same bye.Also, no information on/in the box about who developed this, how to get help, etc."
2,Buyer beware,"Product? ExcellentHOWVER; DON'T be fooled by Wonder Electronics listing of this product, which is substantially below that of their competitors. A TOTALLY outrageous (and in this state, fraudulent)s/h charge for UPS ground of $99 (actual charge for weight according to UPS no more than $39) smacks of a blatant attempt to avoid commissions to Amazon !"
5,I love this blender!,"This blender works great for making my morning smoothies! It has a very clean and simple design and is holding up to be very durable. The pitcher is a made is a really thick glass, not thin plastic like a lot of the others on the market."
1,Cuisinart = Poor Quality / Poor Warranty,"On the plus side, the unit is still running (albeit it gives off an ""electrical"" smell). However, all the labeling wore off the unit within 3 months of use (was only using a wet cloth to clean it) and Cuisinart refused to replace it under warranty as ""that is just a cosmetic defect"""
5,excellent,the blender is very nice for the money. Crushes ice instantly. I would recommend this blender.
1,NOT a smart buy...,"To preface this review, we had been happy owners of an oster workhorse blender for over 25 years. When the faithful oster finally gave up, we purchased this Cuisinart SPB-6. We were the proud owners of the SPB-6 blender from November 12, 2009 to February 15, 2010. It was used a total of five times and ran fine...it did smell of over-heated electronics but got the job done. On the sixth use, after plugging the unit in, NOTHING! The lights above the buttons were on, but when pressing buttons there was only an electrical ""click"". The unit would not run. Thank goodness the box had been saved, (thanks to a couple of reviews at this site) and we were able to march the defective SPB-6 back to the store where we received a full refund. New purchase is an oster to replace it...time will tell. Think twice before purchasing the Cuisinart SPB-6...and be sure to save the box and the receipt!"
2,Not the quality I'd expect from Cuisinart,"This blender works fine for making smoothies, if you run it long enough. However the bowl is very difficult to take apart - there's no place to get a good grip to unscrew it. The labels on the buttons (""on"" ""off"") have worn off after a year. And sometimes on the ""ice crush"" mode, it simply unscrews the bowl instead of sucking down the ice! Also, the cover has all these little places where food can get stuck and it's very hard to clean. You'd think after making blenders for decades, they'd have figured all these things out!I'd say overall, it's a poor design.Cuisinart SPB-6 SmartPower Classic 48-Ounce 6-Speed Blender, White"
3,"Powerful, yet smelly?",This blender works but smells like burning whenever I run it. I am not so happy with it because of the smell but it sure blends.
2,Where's the power?,"This kitchen appliance makes a lot of noise and doesn't do a lot of work. The motor smells like it's overheating even when just mixing protien drinks that are almost all liquids. It is a poor food processor at best. (clogs easily) It is easy to take apart and clean and the pitcher is solid, but try another brand."
3,Love it or Loathe it,I bought this blender at Macys on sale about $50. Did have trouble on 2nd use-always keep receipts and warrantys. Warranty replaced unit (now I have 2 glass containers - many mixed drinks) and no problems yet - still have about 2 1/2 yrs left on warranty. I do like the ice crusher componet as my refrig is old fashion and has no built ins. Sounds like a Love it or loathe it mixer having read the various reviews but I think this can be said of many counter-top blenders..
5,Deep Funk,"When so much criticism is thrown is thrown at 70s music (the excessively hedonistic disco era), some tend to overlook the fact that despite lacking the unity or the the brotherhood of its preceding decade that would form the bedrock of these forays - there were many defining 'moments'.The World is a Ghetto is one such.Alongwith P-Funk, Stevie Wonder and The Meters they were the mainstay of the new Funk that was picking up the gauntlet where Sly, Hendrix and James Brown had left it. Well balanced with a blend of straight ahead R&B;, jazz and rock, War defined all that was good about popular music in that mixed up decade"
1,World is a Ghetto,I love War and have the vinyl but the recoring of this is really bad I dont know if it is just a dodgey copy but not happy
4,amazon verified purchase,Bought this item as a gift for a friend. I haven't heard from him how he liked it. I enjoyed it years back. Probably still the same.
1,Greed!,"A big BOO! to those who released World Is a Ghetto: 40th Anniversary Edition ~ War with bonus tracks, but don't allow one to buy only the bonus tracks if you already have the album. You have to buy the new CD to get them. Keep your bonus tracks, you greedy ...!This CD would get 10 stars from me, but I'd give it a ZERO if I could for the greed!"
3,mine has been a little flaky,"I've had this phone for a year or so, and while I'm pretty happy with it's functionality, it has always had some problems with crashing, spontaneously rebooting, or just spontaneously turning off, and these have worsened gradually with time. The camera takes OK pictures in really good light, but degrades very quickly in less-than-ideal lighting conditions... and the ergonomics of camera use are weird, IMHO. The battery life hasn't held up too well over time either.I've decided to upgrade to a Sony-Ericsson K550i Cyber-Shot. It's smaller, lighter, has better battery life and is known for its reliability. The camera resolution is better, the camera ergonomics are better, it's an MP3 player too. Worth the extra $50, in my book, at least for my needs. This phone isn't bad - it's served me well, and it will make a good backup, but I wouldn't pay out of pocket for an unlocked replacement."
4,Cool phone but NOT for the the Average Joe! ! !,I have had this phone for a couple of months and I am happy to say this buy is worth the money for those who know how to use the features.The 1.3 mpxl camera is good but the night mode sucks . The xpress print software is something new among phones and is good for instant photos . It is gps enabled which is also amazing. The mp3 player is nothing much to rave about - good for people who are happy with 10 songs on their phone. The features overall being all hi - tech is pleasing to a customer but Be Warned - This Phone is heavy and big-OVERALL A GOOD BUY FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BEING HIP IN PHONES AND LIKE A LUMP HANGING IN THEIR POCKET.

4,Oracle Java apps step-by-step,"This is a step-by-step walkthrough of Oracle App Server programming. It goes from application architecture basics through twenty-one chapters on using various APIs and services (with one on installation) to end on clustering and failover. Graphics are used quite heavily, often showing page by page use of various Wizards.Where the book excels is in it's explanation of the various XML descriptor standards required to register web services, or message queues, or various other system services. Often these things are opaque mojo and the author demystifies these files and shows exactly where modifications need to be made.The code samples are relatively short, just enough to flesh out the topic.This is more a field guide than an indefensible reference work. The chapters are too brief and the coverage too scanty to be an in-depth treatise on any one topic. As long as you understand this you won't be disappointed."
5,Help Yourself,I read the book through my local library and enjoyed it soo much I had to buy it.Some point smade by the suthor were really eye opening especially for young parents.
2,Does it work?,"All the reviews here give an opinion on whether it is a good read. No one has commented what impact the 15 day plan has had on them. While I have just finished the book and haven't done the formal program, I can say that I have done parts previous to this and haven't noticed any improvements in mental competency. ""How to think like Leonardo DeVinci"" seems a better plan in this regard."
5,Wonderful information,"This book is great. It is truly a guide to improve our brains. This book is a must for anyone that cares about their health and mind. Many of the points he brings out are things I really hadn't thought about like, pollution, sleep and being deprived of proper nutrients. This book tells us how to improve our brains/minds in as little as 15 days. Must have book."
3,I Must Have a Great Brain Already...,"This book was given as a present and I noticed it reflected the giver's fears about losing mental faculties in the natural, aging process. However, after reading the first few chapters and taking some time to skim over the rest, I found it told me nothing new about how to take care of the physical portion of my mind. It basically said to eat right, exercise, keep learning new things, get enough sleep, avoid over-doing alcohol and drugs, even prescription ones; all obvious (I hope) to anyone interested in keeping their wits about them.No, I don't recommend this book in particular. However, I will always recommend investigating what can be done to put off old-age befuddlement. And if, for my fellow readers, it means this book, then by all means, grab it and go."
2,"Should use his ""great brain"" to make this book better",I often wonder about the reviews here and question a 5 star rating. The author's relatives must have reviewed this book. I found this book very repetitive and not enlightening in the least. I gave up after about one third of the book. Don't waste your time.
1,Waste of time and money,"exercise, proper diet and supplements may help your brain function - wow I didn't know that !"
2,making a good brain great,"A thought-provoking an informative book, it provides new insight into the mind-brain system and has made me rethink my own thought processes. Sounds redundant, but it's true! Love the book."
4,Thorough,"This Book was thorough, slightly repetitious, and did I mention thorough. If you do what he says then you should have a better brain in no time. Results may vary."
3,Unimpressed,"I purchased this to keep my cats out and it absolutely doesn't work for that. It caved in immediately as soon as one climbed on it. Luckily, my baby was not in the co-sleeper at the time. Put it away immediately. Granted, I don't think they advertise it as cat protection so rating it in the middle."
2,Useless unless you're using it outside...,"I love my arms' reach, but the canopy is a waste of $$, IMHO. We got it only as an attempt to keep cats out of the co-sleeper, but as it turned out (tried it w/o baby in it, thankfully, lol!), cats' weight just caved in the soft plastic ribbing. Pointless for us. Perhaps as a mosquito net it might work. The added reaching through the opening made it very hard to get the baby out for feedings, so really, it was up for about 24 hours and we took it down and used the mobile over the changing table and the rest went into a closet, where it still sits today. Sigh. Just a gadget, not useful for us. LOVE the co-sleeper though! GREAT concept. Co-sleeping w/o bedsharing makes even grouchy pediatricians on the AAP happy. ;) Our babies still ended up in our bed most nights though, practicing Dr. James McKenna's Safer Bedsharing Guidelines... Exclusively breastfed, always sober, etc... Good luck with your little love(s)!"
4,Not perfect but better than nothing.,"I purchased this crib tent to keep the cats out, as it seems most people do. What the other reviews said is true, the canopy will cave in if the cat climbs onto it. However for cats that are simply curious about exploring a potential new cozy spot to sleep, this does the trick. Our cats sniffed around it, pawed at the sides a bit, and then ignored it. So for us it's worked well. Now if we could just get our son to sleep in the co-sleeper we'd be set."
4,Nothing Else Beside is a pretty good CD,"Siler's Bald did a good job once again. I liked their other cd and i really liked this one. A cd for the saints of God. I think you will like this cd, very good value for the price."
4,Almost Perfect,"The coasters are gorgeous, especially when they are stacked together in the holder. Unfortunately the rubber feet fall off and slide around. But since they are so cheap, I can just buy a new set."
2,"Pretty looking optical illusion, mediocre coasters...","Oversight on my part...If you're going to get coasters to absorb liquids that sweat from your cups, pick something other than glass. Leather, wood, and cork would probably be far more suitable options.While these are pretty and very decorative, they're terrible at doing what they're designed to do, which is keep my table dry. Whenever I put a cold drink on one of these, there's soon water sweating off the glass, onto the coaster, and then pooling on it until it dribbles off onto the table.These coasters need a lip to prevent spillage and make them useful.To add a bit more disappointment, the clear rubber feet on each coaster are not put on uniformly, creating an odd staggered look into the optical illusion of having these coasters stacked.Again, very pretty, but not practical and not terribly useful."
3,glass coasters,i loved these glass coasters they are so me but the only thing that was wrong with it was the last coaster didnt have all 4 clear grips it only had 3 so it leans to one side...is there any way i can get that clear grip since it was missing???
4,Pretty good,"These feel solid, look nice, and do the job they're intended to do (protect your furniture). I do have to dock one star, though, because these will stick to your glass sometimes as the glass becomes wet. This is a more general problem for coasters. The workaround is to lift one side of the glass off first, so it won't ""suction"" the drinking glass to the coaster.I ditched the holder, so I can't speak to the durability, etc. of that piece. I simply keep my coasters in a stack."
1,Spent almost as much time in repair as in my use :(,"I got this laptop back in 2007 for graduation and it seemed like everything I would want: Fast processors, large memory, large screen, full loaded media. Unfortunately the computer just doesn't work well. For the first year or so it just crashed every day. It didn't come with word or other word processing programs either. Being a student that is important. I had it sent in multiple times because it wouldn't turn on because the power socket is easily damaged.List of repairs made:Three times to fix lack of poweronce for a broken screen (my brother threw it)my computer deleted the wireless card from the BIOS or something like thatonce for software repair because it wouldn't bootand now it won't turn on again. Great!!!!This is my last repair and my warranty is up. Booo!!"
2,The other review has the WRONG book,"Karen Jones Delk's ""The Bride Price"" is a romance novel...and it's not memorably good. It starts out well, but the hero, Sharif's possessiveness, and his attempts at controlling the heroine, Bryna, in the last 1/3 of the book (when she's lost her memory following a trauma) are not very attractive. Frankly, Sharif's actions toward Bryna put him only a notch above his skank nephew who was Bryna's ""master"" in the first place. Sure, there are moments of sensuality, but when it came to romance, it just wasn't happening.Still, one has to give the author kudos for her research into the Arabian desert, the desert tribes, and Africa in the early-19th century. She can write, but the romance aspect of this novel just didn't take off. (And since it IS supposed to be a romance novel, that's kind of important.)"
3,Vista is too much for the configuration,"The laptop hardware is ok but for the configuration Windows Vista is too heavy, really slow, is better if Windows XP came installed."
4,Read a book first.,"I really liked the first hour of this four hour production. This section contains the progress reports from North American Aviation to the U.S. Air Force from mid 1964 to the end of 1965. The other three hours are silent flight test footage and various incidents associated with the XB-70 program. It was hard for me to watch the same two planes take-off and land again without much forward scan speed.Although well put together, I would probably recommend this DVD for XB-70A enthusiasts who have prior knowledge of the aircraft."
2,Poor effort from Spacecraft Films,I am a fan of this sort of material. I own all of the Spacecraft Films series and this DVD is from the same company. I ordered the DVD directly from Spacecraft Films. When the package arrived the DVD was seemingly made on a PC as the disc was a simple DVD-R with a cheap case and the paper insert contains no information at all. On the disc itself; the production reports included were very interesting but the biggest flaw in the set is that there is NO mention of the tragic crash and loss of the second XB-70. This very much confuses me how a major part of the program; the loss of one of two planes is not even mentioned.I am VERY disappointed in this disc.
3,Rough around the edges,"This is a strange mixture of musical tastes and it doesn't always work well. I do love to hear Nascimento's voice. Some of his songs are wonderful, too. There are some cuts I particularly liked and if the entire album were as nice, I'd have rated this with 5 stars."
4,as an aside ...,"flora purim's version of ""fairy tale song"" is stunning ! i'm in search of this version, but it appears that the album it's on has not been re-released as a CD. i'm hopeful !"
3,Great Brazilian Singer and Composer but not in English,Unfortunately I have to say Nascimento does not hip in English language. And this compromises the CD final result. There is also a cool environment that does not match the Nascimento's best ensemble.
2,ISSUES,"Having promptly received these replacement blades, I set about installing them. While the 22"" blade easily popped into the existing wiper arm bracket, it became apparent that the (original) black plastic retaining clip would not slide onto the new BOSCH blades to hold them in place.Other vendors show what looks like two small clips that appear to go with this set of blades. No such clips came with my blades, nor do they appear in photos, thus causing them to be returned. These are supposed to be AUDI OEM replacement wipers and therefore it's reasonable to assume that they should come good to go."
4,Soft but not so absorbent at first,"When we first received them, we found these towels to be extremely soft, but not very absorbent. I will admit that they are more absorbent now that they've been washed and dried many, many times. My wife found that drying them without dryer sheets helped to improve the absorbency. On the plus side, they have held their color - have not faded at all. And they're still very soft."
5,"makes you mouth say ""ahhhh""","Great for freshening your mouth while cleaning your teeth, gums and tongue all at the same time. ADA Accepted, so you know it won't saw off your enamel, and flouride packed to protect the enamel you've got."
5,Great tracks!,This is the best mecha anime theme song in a long time! I really enjoyed the 4 tracks provided here by JAM Project! Here is the track listing:1-Fire Wars (Full Version)2-Tornado (Full Version)3-Fire Wars (Intrumental)4-Tornado (Instrumental)
2,What a disappointment,"As a former competitive figure skater, I was really looking forward to Mr. Thompson's book. I was excited to read the first ""adult"" novel about skating. However, this book was less about skating and more about too many other things. If you are looking for a true look at the world of skating, look elsewhere. This book contains more information about Japanese manners, the Japanese mafia, and Japanese social structure than about skating. What is written about skating is terribly stereotyped and does nothing to change the image of the sport as hyper-competitive, filled with tormented athletes and coaches and people only engaged in the quest for the almighty $$$. Very little is written about the true aspects of a skaters training and lifestyle. There are better books out there about what competitive figure skating is all about."
3,"One finger on the ice, complete recovery","Megumi Campbell a girl of mixed heritage, fierce focus and relentless determination, is driven to be the best ice dancer she can be. The synergy of American competitiveness with Japanese acceptance of fate is drawn with an unflinching trueness. The biggest flaw is the pacing of almost one-fifth of the book. The jumps back and forth in time are jarring to say the least. And personally I intensely dislike dialogue that intersperses a foreign language, it's like watching movies in english where all the characters speak with heavy non-english accents when the intent is is that they are speaking their native language. But, if you've followed ice skating, if competative sports and Japanese culture interests you, this book is worth your time."
3,Not that helpful,"I bought this book based on the other reviews but I have to say I found it somewhat dense reading and hard to get through. I'm sure it's packed with good information, but I think the layout is daunting and not ""user friendly."" I much prefer the formatting, layout and style of ""Math Into LaTeX""."
4,Works fine as phone & PDA,"Two and a half months of use and I've been pretty happy.Works fine when used as a regular phone (i.e. up to your ear) and the PDA features are very quick to operate, due to the very fast processor. I also really like it's small size, smaller than other PocketPC Phones I've seen out there. It's easily pocketable in a shirt or pants pocket.Phone reception has been better than average, even internationally. Jotting down a note or opening a file while on the phone is a seamless operation. The PPC4100 comes with a lot of storage capacity and great screen. I've used it to watch videos and listen to music.On the minus side, I wish it had a louder ring and louder volume in speakerphone mode. Also, I wish it had built in bluetooth and WiFi. But, for the price, it's an excellent value.I'm very happy to not have to carry my phone AND separate PDA, anymore!"
1,"Nice PDA, Poor Wireless Device","As the review title says, PPC4100 is a nice and compact PDA with quite an attractive look, but its a very poor wireless device, to say the least.Because it comes with ATT Wireless thats notorius for bad GSM service (as I know), it made the matters worse and I didnt know whether to blame the carrier or the phone for such poor reception and signal, and terrible voice quality. Given that people DO use ATT Wireless in NY/ NJ without going nuts about it, I can only blame the phone for it.Comes with Windows Pocket PC 2003 installed, fluid graphics and other good PDA features. Had to send mine back to Amazon."
4,OK for the price,This is a good phone for someone starting out with PDA Phones. There are not of upgrades or new programs that you can get for it.
3,childhood favorite,"I first came across Andre Norton as a teenager. This was one of the first novels that I read that used cats as the main characters. Made me think and realize that everything is interconnected. This novel, Iron Cage, made a major impsct on my life and has continued to do so"
3,Amp,Strong amp for in door speakers but it gets HOT!!!Do not put anything directly touching the top of it!!! Mine is drilled into the middle of my box.
2,Big on Promise Short on Delivery,"This treatment maybe be technically sound, but the pieces are as flat as pancakes which makes it difficult to get enthusiastic about playing them. Proves the point that musical creativity is more than just following an algorithm. I went through this book once and haven't touched it since."
2,Decent distractions,"2 1/2While possessing the cut-and-pasted shallowly schizophrenic cluttering many minor drill-n-baser's display, Hrvatski cannot completely be ignored for at least some engrossing computer noise. Decent distractions"
3,Hunter Air Purifier model# 30546,"This Room purifier still gives off a slight burning motor smell. I called the manufacturer and they stated that the smell will go away, it smells that way because it is new. It is 11 months later and I am still waiting for the smell to go away. Over all it is a good product which keeps the dust out of the air. No more sneezing. Highly acclaimed by consumer reports. It deserves 5 stars, but the burning motor smell takes away from the total."
4,a solid reference,"I bought this book, just for a couple of the chapters, but i found myself using more of this book then i expected, and reading all the chapters(even the fortran stuff). I found this book better then all my other ""scientific python"" books, in that my other books really built toyish apps. This book is meant for people doing production computational science work in python. It doesn't have much btw on super computer's programming and python, aside from a lot on how to integrate c/c++/fortan libraries(i.e. anyone doing major work in python probably is integrating to things like Tesla/Hadoop/mpi ... etc ... and the book didn't go to that level)."
2,Horrible,This was a painful book to read. There was actually very little about Leonardo in this book ... rather it was filled with the historical happenings. I was sorely disappointed by the lack of valid material ... much of the book was the author surmising and assuming Leonardo's motives and thoughts.I forced myself to finish this book - but it was extremely painful!
5,An Enthralling Book on Da Vinci,"Normally I am not a fan of non-fiction books. Yet, this book somehow has managed to enthrall me in a way that no other non-fiction book ever has. This alone is the reason that I would recommend it to others. Then, the question of who I would recommend this book to must also be answered. In this case, I would say that I would recommend for a reading level of high school senior and beyond.Overall, this was a very encapsulating book, covering numerous aspects of da Vinci's life. I throughly enjoyed the book and actually learned interesting information from it. I look forward to a time when I might be able to read it again to get even more information from it."
3,Not a starting point,"I do not have any real background in Art History, nor did I know much more about Leonardo than cultural references had taught me. I bought this due to a healthy curiosity to learn more about an obviously important and interesting person in history. I very quickly realized I was in over my head.I finished the book, although it took me some time. It was equal parts informative and tedious. Lacking the background on other artists before, during and after his lifetime made many parts difficult to follow. Of the other parts, they were more interesting and enjoyable.If you are looking for something that reads more like a novel than a history book try something else. In the places where this book fails, I would have to be honest and say that failure is probably more on my part than the writer's. The writer has definitely does his homework and added his own color when the facts become scarce."
5,Leonardo exposed - great read,Reads like fiction but tells the factual story. How the author was able to pull together enough detail for this wonderful look at one of the world's greatest thinkers is beyond me. But the journey was well worth the trip.
4,Good general biography of Da Vinci,"Translated from the French (the translation is fairly well done and readable), this is a good general bio of Leonardo's life. A primer rather than an in depth artistic analysis, it's geared towards the general reader and it does a fine job at that.Da Vinci's life is followed from his small town upbringing by a father who was a notary (in the European sense not the American) and hence held a status higher than the average peasant or townsman.Serge Bramly attempts some psychoanalysis of Da Vinci and if there is a main weakness to the book in my opinion it is that. His explanation of art workshops in the Renaissance era is interesting and informative. To be commended is his description of Da Vinci's relationships with his workers, friends and family. But best of all is Bramly's explanation of the relationships between the nobility who financed his projects and Da Vinci.An informative and enjoyable biography; Leonardo: The Artist and the Man is worth a read."
1,We thought we had mice,"It is good quality, but the sounds are light sensitive and my son keeps misplacing the pieces. Early on, when I would turn off the lights, I would hear the gerbil and I thought we had an infestation. Now, I am used to hearing all the animals complain every night when I turn out the lights."
2,Quickly forgotten,"My 14 month-old was not very interested with wooden puzzles, so I thought adding noise to them would change that. Unfortunately, it took him about 25 minutes to figure out that all he had to do to was to step on the right piece of the puzzle to make the sound come out. He has since then stopped trying to place each piece in the puzzle and is not even amused by stepping on it any more. Overall, this toy lasted 3 days. The sounds are also very electronic (fake) and they will sound when you switch the lights on, when you step beside the cupboard where they have been stored, or for no apparent reason!"
4,Bought for Autistic Nephew,"I bought these for my Autistic nephew when he was 2 on the recommendation of an Occupational Therapist. Having no children of my own, I am not familiar with the different brands for children's toys. After asking around I was told that Melissa and Doug were well known for their safety and quality so I decided to go ahead even though $10 for a puzzle seemed high to me.My nephew loves these. In addition to hearing the sounds and learning to mimic them, he is also learning tactile skills which is what his therapist has been focusing on. I like the quality of the puzzles. They are very well made and remind me of toys I had when I was a kid, when you could actually keep toys to pass on, not the disposable toys there are now.As a special bonus, the sounds are perfect to get on my brothers nerves, hehehe. We are 13 years apart and I love teasing him about getting back at him now for his toddler days![...]"
2,Could have been great.,"I was excited to get this toy for my toddler. My mother has a noise making puzzle and she loves it. However, the other puzzle makes sounds by closing a circuit, not by light sensors. She has quickly learned that she doesn't have to do anything but smack at the puzzle tray to get the sounds to go off. Instead of teaching her how to do a puzzle and associate the sounds with the pictures she has just learned to beat on it. And, as other reviewers commented, because of the light sensors it can make random sounds all the time. As of now we still have all of the pieces, but when we lose one (which I'm sure will happen.) then we will have problems. It is already annoying that when I walk past the puzzle during the day, and cast a shadow on it I am going to hear a random noise. However, the sounds aren't too loud or annoying. It was so close to being a great puzzle, but the light sensors have ruined it for me."
3,Melissa & Doug Pets Sound Puzzle,"Some of the animals did not make sounds. The puzzle should come with batteries, otherwise my granddaugher enjoyed playing with the puzzle."
2,Very loud and kind of annoying!,"We keep our puzzles in a basket and every time someone walks the sound goes off. Not a big deal during the day.... but during nap time or in the middle of the night (when even one of our cats walks by) I cringe fearing ""ribbet, ribbet"" is going to wake up our toddler. And as I mentioned in the title, this puzzle is LOUD so you can hear it throughout the house! Also, the kitten piece doesn't sound like a meow at all and the parakeets ""squawk"" sounds closer to fingernails running down a chalkboard.I'd be over it if this was one of his favorites. But our son doesn't favor this particular puzzle over any other. The wood puzzle itself is of the same quality you'd expect in a M&D; product, so that is the only reason it gets two stars.Bottom line: Save a couple of bucks and buy the M&D; puzzles that don't make noise."
2,Mediocre - big potential ruined by a poor engineering,"We bought this toy for our 1,5 year old son a month or so ago. Don't get me wrong - it's a durable toy with a big potential but badly designed. I'll skip a tin-like sounds - as far as I can see it has been already covered by other reviewers. Our problem with this toy - if you take a cat panel and cover dog's niche - it would not fit (as it should be), but it will still trigger photo-elements and it will start barking. So how you suppose to explain to the kid which animal makes what kind of sound in this case? From the educational point of view - mediocre at least. Long story short - good idea, poor engineering. With a different design might be a good toy.Another ""good"" feature - when it gets dark in a house and this toy was left on a table with couple of figures not covered - prepare for a sudden barking or squeaking - darkening room triggers this toy."
2,not so great,"i bought this through amazon for my 1yr old daughters bday. the toy lasted all of one day. half of the animals will not make any sound when the piece is picked up. when sitting on a table,untouched and away from all movement, the toy randomly makes the animal noises. i would not recommend this product."
4,Pet Sound Puzzle,The sound is a low but can be heard in a quiet environment. The reward of sound for each puzzle piece keeps the person motivated to continue working on the puzzle. I like the thickness of the wooden pieces which increases the durability of the puzzle. I have ordered many of the Melissa and Doug puzzles and they all are a great addition to my collection.
3,Not impressed by the technology,"My daughter is just getting the hang of puzzles, so I thought this would be perfect for her. Not only would she get the reward of fitting the piece in the correct spot, she'd also get the reward of an animal sound.I didn't realize that the sounds have nothing to do with the pieces: it's just a little light-sensitive chip in the well. So you only have to cover up the well to make the sound: with a different piece, with your hand, by turning the light off at night when I go to bed (so annoying). So my daughter has no interest in doing the puzzle: she figured out right away that she just has to cover the chip. Which she pretty quickly got bored with.I'm going to take out the batteries and just use it as a regular puzzle. I'm just disappointed, because surely there was some way to match up the chip with each piece. Why didn't the manufacturers just do that?"
3,"Quality puzzle, but...","The puzzle is well made and the sound is good. However, the sounds will go off no matter which puzzle piece is inserted in to the space. So the child gets the reward of the sound whether they did it correctly or not."
1,Disappointed with the quality,"The puzzles are pretty poor quality construction. Other wood puzzles are much more durable, this one is just a paper sticker over the top which peels and falls off with the slightest moisture. Apart from that, the sound quality is also very poor and it hard to discern some of the sounds."
1,Impossible to clean,"I thought I found the perfect travel mug, until I used it a few times and discovered that it will never be clean. The rim traps liquid then it drips back down later. I use milk in my coffee and this mug constantly smells like sour milk no matter how much I scour with a bottle brush and sponge, then rinse several times.After cleaning, it always releases a dirty liquid which is disgusting. It is so unsanitary I am throwing it away.If you do buy this, make sure to dry standing up."
2,Vacuum insulated but doesn't stay hot!,I recently purchased direct from Contigo to get the vacuum insulated. With shipping that sets you back nearly $30. The coffee does not stay hot for more than 1/2 hour. Has Contigo opted for a cheaper supplier? If so would have been nice for them to pass that savings on to us since this doesn't measure up to all claims. Caribiner handle and lid are great but there is no need to carry the cup with you if the coffee is stone cold. I have foam insulated tumblers and older Nissan mugs that will keep coffee hot for hours. Contigo...go back to the drawing board and let people who bought this mug trade it in for a new one.
1,Nearly Impossible To Find the Vacumn Insulated Version,"This is my 2nd time reviewing this product, as my first was removed for some reason. I guess I was too truthful!!I looked everywhere for this mug (even sent an email to the company inquiring where it could be found) and had no luck. Wherever I saw one, it was the foam insulated version, and from experience, they don't insulate very well. And from reading the problems given in the other reviews, I'm glad I didn't find one (leaks, walls separating, spring lid breaking, etc.). I happend to stumble across another stainless steel, vacumn insuilated travel mug (check my other reviews for it) that I LOVE! It can be found at Target department stores in the camping section (I have no idea why). I do reccomend THAT mug - I've bought 3 now, 1 for work, 1 for home & travel, and 1 for my brother-in-law. He alo loves his!"
1,Useless!,"Great features, spill-proof, easy to carry...all that is great. But my biggest priority (and I don't mind paying serious money to get it) is something that will keep my coffee piping hot most of the day. I nearly burned my hand on the outside of it the first time I filled it; escaping heat speaks poorly of insulating qualities -- sure enough, it didn't keep the coffee hot for even a 20 minute drive to work. This had some great reviews and some poor ones but the consensus seemed to be that the folks who were unhappy with it must have gotten the plastic lined version, rather than the steel-lined. Hmm. Mine is steel-lined.For what it's worth, my favorite thermal cup of all time -- the Contigo West Loop Mug -- is made by the sam company and costs the same as well."
3,Works great if you have the vacuum sealed version,"There are 2 versions of this mug. The vacuum insulated version WILL keep your coffee hot for hours. However, for those who have purchased one of these mugs and have found that they don't, then it is likely, you have the other foam insulated version. I have heard that (...) the vacuum insulated version in a 2 mug set, but I have not actually seen them there."
3,"Good, not great","Looked awesome, real tough coffee cup. I holds up just ok though, dings and chips easily when banged around during commute. It's not dishwasher safe, nor does it claim to be. Results in loosening of some of the plastic seals. My biggest complaint with this cup is that it only keeps beverages hot for 30-45 mins, it's just not that well-insulated. Looks aren't always what they seem."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this one because I was unable to find them at Starbucks anymore. The Contigo mug did not keep my coffee warm for very long. My Starbucs branded mug that is identical in style keeps my coffee warm for several hours. Also, my contigo mug lid broke after just a few months. It is definitely not worth the $20 price tag. You will be sorely disappointed."
2,Deceitfully similar to Starbucks mug,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this mug is deceitfully similar to the higher-end version of the same mug. This particular foam-insulated mug does not keep beverages hot for long at all. Opt for the vacuum-sealed version that you can find on Contigo's website."
1,Awful,"LOVE the design. Doesn't spill a drop.But I ended up with a foam insulated mug, and my coffee doesn't stay hot for more than half an hour. What a waste of money."
1,Impossible to clean hidden inaccessable spaces,"It's durable, and keeps beverages cold for several hours when closed. The problem is there is space between the wall of the cup and the wall of the top. I usually keep lattes in mine, and the beverage gets into the space that can't be cleaned. Even though I would was it every time I used it, it would still smell disgusting, because the beverage in the uncleanable gap was rotting. Yuck!!! I still use it, but it takes a ton of time, water, and effort to wash it, because the only way to remotely try to wash it is to force a jet of water under the rim space all the way around the opening, and hope it gets everything out. It's not my highest priority right now, since I only use it once or twice each week, but I'm not pleased with it at all. If they would just seal that space I would consider it an excellent cup. But I've never seen any other cup in my life that could not be washed to avoid having beverages spoil inside it when you think it's clean. Yuck!"
2,Almost great but major flaw,"My husband and I have both used a set of these mugs we bought at Costco about two years ago. They are excellent in every aspect with the exception of one thing. As other reviewers have noted, they smell horribly after awhile because coffee, milk, etc. gets inside the plastic top piece and rots. We clean ours extremely well and yet I must throw them out because there is no way to get to the source of whatever gross stuff is stuck inside them."
5,Best Thermos Yet,"This is the best thermos I have encountered yet. As long as the lid is closed, it really does keep the bev piping hot for hours. Easy grip and leak free. I received this as an early x-mas present and I now I don't have to fret about what to get others for x-mas :)"
1,Don't Buy! Will Detroy your HDD,"Stay away from Sabrent enclosures. It killed two of my had drives with years for information and memories I can never get back. The capacitor blew on one of the unit and it took out that unit and the other unit that was attached to the same power strip. Tried contacting their tech support, but no response. Spend couple more bucks and buy something you won't regret!"
3,"good product, bad exchange sevice","send me the one without wire, exchange with restocking fee, i'm totally unhapy with it, is it my fault?"
2,Yeah...it's crap,"I just bought this, and now I wish I'd read these reviews first. The thing really IS too short to fit the hard drive and its plugs. If I take the cap off the other end, THEN it fits. But, its not a very nice solution...it's pretty ugly in fact. My advice? Don't buy it."
1,Worthless,The usb enclosure wants you to have a Fat32 formatted drive to install it? Acceptable maybe 5 years ago but not today! Buy another enclosure!
1,Fire Hazard!,"I purchased two of these enclosures thinking that a manufacturer can't possibly screw up a metal box and a power supply. Apparently I was wrong! Less than 24 hours after installing my hard drive into the enclosure, I heard a popping sound and then smelled melting plastic. The power supply was completely fried, and I have a dead hard drive to top it off. I tried the second enclosure as well and started smelling burnt plastic immediately after plugging it in. I would strongly caution you against purchasing this enclosure."
1,Beware it destroys hard Drives!!,I bought this product out of my foolishness despite reading some bad reviews about it. I needed 2 enclosures and this seemed just the right product for money. Unfortunately my Seagate hard drive simply died when I installed that drive in it. I thought it was a coincidence and placed another hard drive in it that worked fine for about a month. Last night that hard drive stopped working. I opened the enclosure and removed My Maxtor 300 GB drive that had burnt!! all the plastic of the power supply had melted. I suspect that this enclosure is unable to issue a consistent voltage and burns the drives. PLEASE NEVER BUY THIS ENCLOSURE IF YOU WISH TO SAVE YOUR DATA AND DRIVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
4,Good!,"I put a 200Gb seagate inside of it to use as a usb backup drive for my notebook.It was very tigh to put the hd inside it but I like this way. Seems to be more secure for :)The usb speed is good, the noise is low. I'm satisfied."
1,Absolute waste of money,"This is an absolute waste of money. It comes with no instructions on how to disassemble and reassemble it. While disassembling it I broke one of the pieces of cosmetic plastic. Then, I find out my hard drive is TOO LONG for the unit. I then decide to turn it on without both ends closed. After several attempts I finally get Windows XP Pro to detect it. I transferred some files at a decent speed then shut the unit down. A few hours later I Went to use the unit again, and my only 3 month old HD now makes an annoying clicking sound and is pretty much ruined, no doubt thanks to this Sabrent piece of junk."
3,Not bad,This book was pretty good. It had some funny parts. I wasn't very happy with the way the book ended. I could have used a little more closer.
2,Not funny or a page turner...,"I read the review on this book and everyone raved about how funny it was. So I decided to give it a read. Compared to the other ""laugh out loud"" books I've read, I had to give it a 2 star. The only reason I read it to the end was due to my compulsive ""start it - have to - finish it"" rule. I found it to be boring and it lacked the amusement and impulse in wanting to read on."
2,Couldn't get into it!,I continued to read this book until I got to chapter 3. After I just couldn't do it anymore. Found it boring and not funny at all!
3,Good and rare. Not one of Davis' finest.,"I have at least 16 Bette Davis DVD's at this point and am a HUGE fan. I even have the very rare 'Another Man's Poison' and a remastered version of 'Of Human Bondage' on DVD. I had never seen Payment on Demand and was wildly excited to get it in the mail.It is a good film. It is not one of Davis' most memorable however. There isn't enough of her extraordinary acting ability in it. She plays it safe in this, for the most part. Still, she can get tears out of you at the end when she weeps in the car.The picture quality is absolutely superb, as is the sound.I recommend this to seasoned Davis collectors, but not for a new fan. This is not going to grab a ""newbie"" in any profound way. For that, I would recommend 'Now Voyager', 'The Letter' or 'All About Eve.'"
1,Disappointed,"Betty Davis did not play her usual role; she was more like on good behavior in this movie. The only thing that was interesting in this movie is the viewers get to see what her real life daughter looks like. Otherwise, don't waste your money or time."
5,Fabulous Bette Davis,"A great film, that should have been titled The Story of a Divorce, but got this title instead.In any case, Bette Davis is so remarkable in it, with her ability to turn the attention to her and for her in the course of this film is amazing, and it is what she needs to do and of course does with great art.See it and watch that last scene, her face."
4,What are the best things in life?,"Kreeft makes philosophy accessible to those without a university education. His ""Refutation of Moral Relativism"" and ""Socrates Meets Jesus"" are both written in a similar style: a Socratic dialog between two people. In this book, the dialogs are between the real Socrates and students at Desperate State University. Kreeft explores issues related to belief in God, success, and the value of money."
4,beautiful,"we bought these marbles - and six other sets - for a game that we had made ourselves. i was unsure that the colors online would really be the color of the product ordered, but they are! really very attractive and fun to use."
5,very cool,just bought these for my son he just got into marbles and it also takes me back so im glad they make them look cool now
5,Excellent for $3,"I just bought this for one song I couldn't find anywhere else, ""The Poor Peoples Struggle"". Nothing else on it really grabbed me so far but for $3 it was well worth it to me."
3,Only a few useful activities,"While I did pull a few things from the book that helped me develop some discussion points for my course, I found that for the most part, the activities were either too tedious and complicated or too simplistic. Of all that were presented, I only found 2 or 3 that I would seriously consider using in a classroom. Not an especially valuable resource."
5,Going Abroad: The Bathroom Survival Guide,"This is a quick read and a very useful book if you plan to do any world traveling. With humor and simple illustrations, the author offers absolutely essential information. It is a great gift for anyone who plans to - Go Abroad."
4,Great Book for a Traveller,"My sister bought this for me before I spent a year travelling. It's entertaining and provides more information than one would expect! I'm definitely going to give it to somebody I know before they go abroad, if not just for sh*ts and giggles.Get it? ...!"
3,good while it lasted,"This is a good plant light, but the bulb certainly didn't last very long. Other plants lights I've had have lasted for years-- this one burned out in a couple of months."
4,A bright idea,"I've been using the G.E. Grow and Show BrightStick for several years. They are a simple and elegant solution to lighting your indoor plants. My 2 minor complaints are that initial installation - getting the drill holes right - can be tricky; and the 6-foot power cords are too short, and the on-off switch too close to the unit. I use these units ceiling mounted - a longer cord, with the power switch closer to the plug would make sense. I use them with a timer, so once they are set up (with an extension cord), you can pretty much forget about them. They last a long time, and my wife's plants love the light.One more minor thing - these can be a bit tough to find, so I was thrilled to see them on Amazon for a great price!"
3,2 minute 10 second boot time,We've had the PC for a a few days. Seems fine but it's very slow compared to my work's old XP machine. The only metrics I have is that the boot time is 2 minutes 10 seconds. The rest is consistent with that.
3,Not bad if you can get it cheap,"Decent laptop. Had mine 2 years. Solid guts and functions. Overall very nice, but two problems:1 - Comes with exactly half the ram you really need for smooth media. Not too expensive to upgrade.2 - Has the dreaded hinge crack problem, but is NOT covered in the recall/fix. If you open and close your computer often... dont get this pc."
1,too bad,"The laptop is great, but suppouse the condition was new, but under the sticker say 90 days of warranty........to bad"
4,Brilliant and beautiful writing,"I loved this book! The writing is rich and full of feeling and the characters drew me in completely. Occasionally I got confused with the plot, but the urgency and imagery in the writing made me unable to put it down. I can't wait until the author writes another!"
1,Faulty,"Cannot make an educated review, film is in German and the English sub-titles caould not be activated. It was not may machine as I viewed other foreign films with subtitles that did operate."
5,This disc is amazing. Everyone should love it right now.,This disc is amazing. Everyone should buy it right now. Anyone who likes either Bang On A Can disc will enjoy it very much.
4,For my father-in-law,I purchased this book for my mother-in law because my father in law was just diagnosed with Diabetes. She was having trouble coming up with cooking ideas that were both healthy and tasty! This book really helped her out alot!
4,"Month of Meals, Quick & Easy Menus...","Great cookbook for those with diabetes or people that have trouble planning healthy, balanced diets. I purchased one book for myself and was so happy with it purchased a second for another family member."
4,Different Point of View,"This is an interesting book. I think some of the other reviewers are putting their values on the book and its content. The author states that Turkish dance is very different from other styles of belly dance, even in the middle east. I think the pictures are worth the price, but it is also worth the text, to give a different view of belly dance. From what I have heard from people who have been to Turkey, the representation of the dance as performed in Turkey that is given is valid. Everyone knows that a costume described as ""Turkish"" means it will generally be more revealing. I have been around belly dance for a long time and I found this author's openness refreshing. I may not like what he says but I am certainly in no place to say he is wrong. Afterall, his book has the endorsement of at least one Turkish belly dancer. The translation is not very professional and is very stilted in some places. Otherwise it is very enjoyable."
4,Visually pleasing and informative resource,"Beutiful photographs of historical and current dancers enhance this reference book about the evolution of the art of Oriental belly dance. Althogh the text is somewhat hard to follow chronologically, it does a good job explaining the evolution of the discipline.The colour photos of the dancers are gorgeous, especially of the very photogenic Princess Banu. Costumers will appreciate their clarity because there are very few visual references available that show a variety of costume styles.The list of master dancers should be better explained. How dancers are rated would also be useful.Consider this a nice addition to your resources on this very old and provocative form of self-expression."
3,"""Interesting""","First of all, I love belly dancing and collect old books and albums, so this was a must-addition to my collection. The book centers on Turkish dancing and Turkish dancers and you will not get a lot of history or any information on ethnic or regional dances. The costumes are elaborate and many of the dancers are considered local stars, but the photos are not for the prudish. The language is very flowery (a friend who spoke English did the translation for the author)and may distract as you attempt to read it. Serious scholars of the dance may not like this and feminists will be outraged, but this is their culture and provides an interesting look into Turkish dance culture."
1,Questionable,"Pretty pictures...but questionable text. Particularly the explanation of why only young dancers perform in Turkey, versus older women in Egypt. He seems to make the assumption Turkish belly dance is too rigorous for ""mature"" women."
2,"Insulting, degrading","This book is an insult to Oriental Dance. Mr. Ozdemir reduces the dance to its sexual component. A few quotes from the book: ""Sexuality is overtly offered in Turkish belly dancing and the dancer cannot help being regarded as a sexual object."" ""[Belly dance] costumes have something in common: They tickle men's feelings."" ""This kind of dancing is just a very delicate, feminine and voluptuous call to sexuality.""Although the book contains some interesting historical information, it is overshadowed by the degrading text and trashy photographs."
5,Extraordinarily Fine,"While familiar with most of the writers in this book (Defoe, Boswell, Dickens, Whitman, Crane, Richard Harding Davis, London, Hersey, Lillian Ross, Talese, Capote, Tom Wolfe, Kidder, Orwell, Liebling, Mailer, Hunter Thompson, Hemingway, Agee, Joseph Mitchell, Rebecca West, Steinbeck, Breslin, Didion, and McPhee), I generally was not familiar with the works included. Additionally, there are numerous other writers I was not familiar with, so most of the reading experience was new to me.The variety of the works chosen is as impressive as their general excellence. In sum, the editors (both of whom teach English and journalism at the University of Delaware) have succeeded in producing a volume that is a delight to read. The only book that I'm aware of that is in the same league isLiterary Journalism.Highly recommended."
4,Very Informative,"Its not THAT academic, more like a junior college or state university academic text, but the authors clearly understand anthropology and religious studies, i.e. what religion is and what it is for. I think the authors have written several similar books, so I don't know how much is recycled here. It has a good section on Rastafarianism which discusses its Abrahamic and Black Nationalist elements. Very enlightening."
5,Great Rock cd,"This is NOT the Zydeco band that always pops up in a Sundogs search. This is a great rock band. The song, ""Like A River"" is simply one of my all-time favorite tunes. This cd came out on Foundation Records in 1996 and is fairly difficult to find but more than worth the effort. I would say 7 out of the 10 songs on the cd are excellent."
5,Great Read,This is a great overall primer on fashon for men. I highly recommend it for any guy just starting out.
1,This item stinks!,"It makes flossing even more of a chore than it already is. No matter how tight you wrap the floss, it doesn't stay set. Plus, the floss itself is not of good quality. It broke every time I used it. I say 'used' because I threw it in the garbage."
2,Useless,"I had braces when I was younger and as a result have pretty tightly packed teeth. I was hoping that this item would make it easier to floss between my back teeth, but had no such luck.I actually find it more difficult to floss in general using the Flosbrush compared to the old-fashioned method. I even went as far as to try wrapping the floss that I normally use around the head of the Flosbrush. This proved that the problem was with the actual Flosbrush and not the floss that they provided.I think the problem stems from the fact that when you normally floss you pull the floss down, between your teeth. With the Flosbrush you are *pushing* the floss down and this simply just doesn't work for me.Keep in mind that my teeth are packed in pretty tight, so if you never had braces or still have sufficient space between your teeth you may not have the same problem. That is why I am giving it two stars. For me, however, the Flosbrush was simply $3 down the drain."
5,Hurry up and write the next one!!!!!!!!,"hello Im ryan. Im a younger reader and ever sice taking a trip to alaska and seeing a sue henry book I have started and finished that series {excellent books} I read the first alaskan Dana Stabanow who has weekly articles in the Alaska Magazine. I must tell you that you would love this book and the ending is great!!!!!! if you havent read the other two the buy all three at the same time. You think { why, thats stupid} naw its great!!! once you read the first page of the first book you wont be able to stop till your hooked. Read the first two first, They are greaT!!!! THIS BOOK HAS A NON STOP PLOT, dana does an excellent job of weaving it to the very end. Youll think you know the characters by the end of the first chapter!! Better hurry up and order. you wont know till you start!!!!"
1,Terrible reader for this series,The reader for this book is impossible for me to listen to without gritting my teeth. Maybe this series is better in written form.
3,"Nothing Special About Liam, But a Well-written Story","I'm not that I understand why so many other reviewers gave this book 5 starts. The book was good but not great. This is my first Liam Campbell mystery and, sorry, I didn't find Liam Campbell to be an exceptionally compelling or inventive character.Ok, that said, this is a very good read. I really enjoyed the picture the author paints of the Alaskan bush. What a setting for a murder mystery? Beyond Liam Campbell, we meet a number of characters who are riddled with their own problems and connected by a series of creepy deaths. This book reinforced the notion that one wouldn't want to get lost in the rugged Alaskan outback amongst the frigid temperature, the lack of daylight, and the beers.I look forward to reading more from Dana Stabenow."
4,Excellent Series,"Dana Stabenow is such a dependable author. Everything she writes has merit.The Liam Campbell Mysteries are an excellent companion to the Kate Shugak series and, as always, Dana's love for Alaska shines through."
5,MOre Liam!,"I love this series. I you like Kate, you will love this just as much. Please give us more, Dana"
4,The Liam Campbell Series,"This is a series I stumbled onto from an Amazon $3.99 & under recomendation. I have now read all 4 of the books. They are fast paced, and immediately intruiging. The characters are full & rich, easy to picture in the real world. I highly recommend this series. I will be moving on the the Kate Shugak (I think I spelled it right) series.Thank you, Amazon, for the fantastic recommendation!"
5,WOW!,"Hadn't heard Steely Dan for years. Great lyrics with super jazz rifts. You can preview the music at Amazon. If you are not tapping your foot to the fast-tempo of the first track, Battisatva, have someone check your vitals. You might have expired. Download it as an MP3 for your IPOD. Then, go fast walking. Good music and exercise! Every track a classic!"
5,Steely Dan Start To Go From Pop To Fusion,"With COUNTDOWN TO ECSTASY, Steely Dan start to go from a pop group to a fusion band, blending Memphis-Chicago-Detroit-Great Plains blues/rock/soul and Brill Building pop with 52nd Street-style jazz, and the lyrics become more obscure. Like PRETZEL LOGIC, this CD will give you what you want, if you let it give you what you need."
4,why your cd player has a program button,"There are two songs on this CD I don't like much: I can't swallow the faux blues of ""Bodhisattva"", and the vocal loop in ""Show Biz Kids"" drives me up the wall. The rest of it is incredible, a marvel of musical engineering: intricately designed songs executed in style by a super-efficient band. When they hit top gear, like in the last minute or so of ""Boston Rag"", it's an awesome display of power, but the engine's still humming like a baby.Program out tracks 1 and 5 then let 'er rip - 30 minutes of ecstacy."
2,the best worst,spin doctors rule steely dan rules aja = a hint of commercial gaucho = sickaningly commercial and that was over 20 years ago just imagine how bad they are now
5,Number 2 to Aja,"Let me be brief: The 'Dan's Two Against Nature tour in 2000 featured more tunes from this album than from any other. That tells me that the composers feel pretty strong about it as well. It's timeless music, and the only album I like better by SD is Aja (well, Katy Lied is a close third), which says a lot."
4,Early Steely Dan is good stuff,"Getting remasters of the 60's/70's rock is a must. Clean, seperated instruments really brings out the talent involved in this album and Steely Dan. The lead guitar is more prominent than I remember from listening to them back in the 70's. Countdown is good stuff that really takes me back."
4,Very good quality,"This tenoning jig is very robust and easy to use.Assembly was easy and relatively quick. Fine adjustment were not difficult to obtain.The bottom of the jib was perfectly flat and didn't contain any burr (I had a bad experience with a Delta tenoning jig which scratched the surface of my table saw).On the down side, the instruction manual could have been more detail.The jig came heavly coated with grease which was a real pain to remove.The cursor is a little useless for fine adjustment."
2,Borderline piece of junk,"Just received this jig from Amazon this past week. Decided on the Jet vs. Delta due to the positive reviews of the Jet, and having owned Jet/Powermatic tools.This jig is borderline crap.Borderline meaning I can probably get it to work after I speak with Jet this week to get parts that actually work. The quick release holding device doesn't work-period. Hoepfully Jet can get me the ""non quick-release"" device.Other issues such as the alignment fence does not go to 90 degrees due to poor design/oversized washers. But I can get that to work.The slignment of the jig to the saw blade is crude, to say the least. But I can get this correctly aligned with enough time and patience.All in all, I am disappointed with this jig. Not sure if the Delta would have been any better though.I own a Powermatic jointer, the Jet 12-36 lathe and a jet dust collector and am very happy with them. I have had my eye on the Jet 1642 lathe but now I am wondering if I should choose another brand."
1,freezes every few moments while playing in 1080i mode,"The DVD player freezes every few moments while upconverting to 1080i - seems like the processor is not fast enough to process it in real-time. So, now we leave it in the 480p mode - the problem goes away but it's not upconverting anymore."
2,Only plays DivX 25fps movies,"I bought it under the impression of PlayAll DivX kind of Upscaling DVD Player.It turned to be otherwise. and also makes lot of noise, screaching sound.Pros- Upscaling works fine.- LooksCons- Bad Design- Sound (while it reads the DivX)- Only plays 25fps avi files. No mpeg, no wmv, problems playing 320 Kbps mp3 songs."
2,WASN'T EVEN WORKING IN THE STORE!!!,"Ok, first off lets get the reason why I gave it two stars out of the way, it looks good.Ok.Now I was at my local electronics store and I was like, cool, this looks like a great product!But when I put one of the STORES DVD's(transformers) in it to test it out, and it wouldn't read it.Put it in another DVD player to make sure it wasn't the DVD, and it wasn't, it was the DVD PLAYER!!!Wow, even the store model was defective, imagine if someone actually bought this, oops, too late."
3,Pretty good,This is a good DVD player for this price. It does what it has to do. The upconverter doesn't make much difference though. This doesn't play VCD's though.
3,STOP before you purchase this unit,"It does NOT play HD DVD's. It does however take your regular dvd's and improve the quality. If you don't have a HD TV, pass on it! And besides the newer regular DVD's and players offer a great picture, why purchase another player to sit besides the one you already have."
1,"ES MUY DURO,","EL ZAPATICO ES MUY DURO ME DAÑO LOS PIES, NO ME LOS PUEDO PONER, NO SE AMOLDAN, LA TIRITA QUE TIENE POR ENCIMA Y LA FORMA DEL ZAPATO ES MUY DURA.NO LO RECOMIENDO"
5,Classical Music for Children,"My sister-in-law introduced me to this cd and my kids loved it, I loved it as well. It's a fun way to intorduce classical music to children and they will learn to love classical music. for parents who love classical music and have children who don't like it, the will love this CD. It shows a diffrent way of telling the story of Peter and the Wolf. The other songs are just as good! I cann't wait to get my CD!"
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this album for my kids for Christmas at a local store. Boy was I irked! There is no narration! How can an album claim to contain Peter and the Wolf, be listed as music for children, and not have this essential ingredient? This orchestral performances are fine, but it ought to be clearly advertised as not being narrated. I bought the Sting version as a replacement, and it is much better."
4,"Not perfect, but great none the less.","This speaker has a very smooth response on and off axis, narrow dispersion, and virtually no diffraction. Bass seems a touch heavy, but easily adjustable on the back of the enclosure. The vertical polar response shows a rather narrow window. Not a big problem if you keep your ear level between the drivers or slightly toward the tweeter side. The tweeter's break up is sort of low at about 15kHz, but it's not really audible. It holds up well at high volumes. Build quality is incredible! That sums this up as far as I'm concerned. I'd get another of it were stolen or destroyed."
3,Just OK,"Size is great, but it is a little hard to open and close. Not good for young kids (12) as they can't open/close it. Have to be careful opening and clsoing because your fingers can get caught in the metal prongs causing injury. i only use it because it is small and light and just for emergencies. Not really usable as your main umbrella."
3,Much room for improvement,"As an emergency/backup umbrella, I think it's overpriced. I think it should be about half its current cost.It's pretty flimsy, hard to open and close, and my backpack gets soaked when I use this to walk through 5 rainy blocks to the train.Also, the handle is hard to hold and not very ergonomic.I'm keeping it because it's pretty small, but that's the only real benefit. It's large enough to keep your shoulders and hair dry, but if you're wearing a backpack with a laptop, the backpack should be waterproof!"
4,It's a spacesaver!,"I must say it is compact!? The product was not what I had in mind, but that is no one's fault but my own! Serivce was quick and professional. And the product will come in handy on those drizzle days of winter."
2,"Great photographic service, poor contents!",Great outlook but rather disappointing from the Beverage technical point of view. The Barman should take some Cuban vacations!
3,Drummers drumming,"""Charles B's"" drumming is a bit lackluster on this album, but that's okay considering, for the most part, his drum parts are buried in the mix."
1,I hate it,I threw it away. I couldn't stand it. Made my hair dull and clumpy. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Friend of Farley,"Inspiring for my son who is a fourth year budding trumpet player. Others are good, but Wynton captures him. And this is a very good cross-section of Wynton, including his favorite ""Carnival of Venice""."
3,Too Much Fluff,"The trumpet-playing here is, as always with Marsalis, brilliant, but there's too much ""trumpet lite"" on this CD - classical elevator music, like the Masterpiece Theater theme. I recommend you get Marsalis' original releases if you'd like to hear great trumpet playing AND a disk full of interesting music. Here you get only one movement of the Haydn concerto, one movement of the Brandenburg, one movement of the Thomasi; the rest of the disk is filled, mostly, with simple, uninteresting D major wedding-music."
3,A fair book; should be used as practice to instruction.,"This is a very nice introductionary book that justly exhaust various topics. Pros: Easy to read, and unoffensive to the readers' intelligence. Many examples, diagrams, summaries, and concatenations between the chapters are well done. Cons: Vague on some explanations, excessive in some passages, not enough answers provided for the exercises."
3,Pretty solid...,"..although sometimes wordy, as another reviewer pointed out. Hurley's biggest problem is that he doesn't write very clearly; this is not an issue in the early going, but as one gets into predicates and the symbolism of logic, one must be very clear in how one communicates the intricacies.I used this book when I taught a logic block of my high school philosophy class, and found the CD most helpful. For that, I'll give this 3 stars. Yay."
2,Wrong Book,"I was not happy with this purchase because it ended not being the book i needed. At first in the website it looked like the book i needed but when i received it, it was not the book."
2,As a philosophy text this book is really lacking.,"There were many problems, but very few examples. The explanations were vague, and without the professor there would have been no hope. Do not buy this book for independent study for the GRE's, it will not help!"
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!!!,"If you have to take a class that requires this text, drop the class. The only thing that can save you is an excellent teacher and good notes. Not only does the text contradict itself, but the professor's answer key isn't always correct. Even within the same edition, there were differences between books. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this book."
2,PROJECT RECORDS---LYCIA,"IT'S SAD TO HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ETHEREAL MUSIC WITHOUT MENTIONING THE TRUE PIONEERS OF IT. PROJECT RECORDS, LYCIA AND SO MANY OTHER ARTISTS ON PROJECT RECORDS LIST, HAVE FOR LONG CREATED SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SURREAL SOUNDSCAPES EVER HEARD BY ANY MUSIC LOVER! IT'S NO SURPRISE THE MAIN STREAM LISTENER HAS PUT SIGRUS ROS ON A THRONE, AFTERALL A FLOCK OF SHEEP ONLY SEE AND HEAR WHAT THE ESTABLISHMENT NICELY PACKAGES. SIGRUS ROS IS GOOD BUT NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL!"
1,Sigur Ros has lost creativity!,"I am big fan of all of Sigur Ros Material, but when I first I heard this album, with my headphones and volume perfectlyprepared for a pure delight, I was very dissapointed. Sure there are some interesting sounds here and there, but nothing that really grabs you like their earlier work.I guess I'll justget out all of my Mogwai and Godspeed albums again. There were many great bands playing this post-rock type music before Sigur Ros appeared on the scene. Maybe a little less PR and more artistic concentration. Thanks for being interested enough to read this."
1,Excruciating,"Sigur Ros sounds like someone unpacking wind chimes while somebody else steps on a doggie chew-toy. If that's not aggravating enough there are also their signature mewling ""vocals."" There is something very odd about the twenty year old set these days: They prefer many bands that have a sachharine, sing-songy quality and an earnestness previously found only in childrens music. Not surprising for a generation that's nutty for Playstation and thinks skateboarding is a career. The infantilization of adulthood continues to be the goal."
3,OK,"Again, You really have to speak Icelandic to appreciate this fully. Other than that one just can appreciate some good tunes.."
3,Good album,"This is the first Sigur Ros album I bought and I can personally attest it is a good album. There is Hoppipolla, a truly fine song and the closest thing to a hit song the Icelandic band ever had (it is very familiar as it has appeared on tv shows, etc.). The rest is basically ambiance music, sad but haunting. If you are feeling depressed because your longtime girlfriend has left you, listening to this record on a rainy day while commiserating on your fate seems like a natural thing to do."
3,Not their best,"I really like Hoppipolla and all but this isn't their best. I almost have all the tracks on this album on my computer. Unlike Agaetis Byrjun and Von, it is kind of annoying. I would suggest Agaetis Byrjun. It doesn't sound like Staralfur or Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa (those two songs are from Agaetis Byrjun)I really think this isn't their best album. Go ahead. Buy this album. You won't be too disappointed..."
4,No disappointment here...,"Sigur Ros has created yet another beautiful album. When I heard their last album (Von)I was disappointed, and speculated the releasing of Takk. However, I was in love after just the first listen and decided to order it that same night. The intricate instruments blend harmoniously with the vocals in a lullaby fashion. The album is tranquil, like wind chimes on a summer night. I recommend this album to new and old listeners. Put it in, lay back, and close your eyes; you will not be disappointed."
4,Very very good.,"well the guy who wrote the synth review doesnt know much but anyone at this page probibly knows that. its all guitar, bass, some keyboard action, alot of strings, some horns and drums. not as good as ageatis byrjun but nothing is. (favorite cd of all time, yeah I wrote a review) This cd is ( ) and ageatis put together. it really isnt the strait forward rock it was supposed to be but it is sigur ros all the way. great cd, up there in the top 5 of the year along with Feels (animal collective) and Illinoise (Sufjan Stevens)."
4,Downright Ethereal,This album is a delight - something rare for a foreign-language album that I can't even understand what is said! But the sound is so full of passion and emotion - while still ranging from rock to soft pop. Sigur Ros is one of those rare bands that can communicate in almost any language because the sound is one that seems universal. This album is unique and is an excellent choice for a night of relaxation - it's worth checking out for sure.
1,"Hey, I got a new synth. Can you sing something on top of this patch?","IF you like ENYA, guys who compose music with synths and dudes who think its clever to sing like they have an overload of estrogen, but without the energy-you'll love this stuff. Perfect music for your magic crystals, your Dungeons and Dragons gaming, your deep-tissue massage. In other words, it's not really music or songs at all. Its just soundscapes composed on a synth that you or I could make had we a couple of Roland synths. Pretentious, artsy-fartsy and utterly lifeless. Good stuff for those of you who like to think you're just a little bit more sophisticated than your average music listener. DOA."
3,"Sorry folks, gotta disagree . . .","I like Sigur Ros. I find the music imaginative, personal and at times profound. It evokes in me the fantasy of those little grey aliens arriving on earth and trying to communicate to us about where they are from and why they are here. We dont understand a word, but through their music they touch our hearts, and we are concerned for the little fellows . . .Notwithstanding the visuals, I have to say that after a year of listening to Takk, I feel rather let down. Granted, there's a couple of outstanding tracks, and the vocal on ""Gong"" is just astonishing (this is where I offer the little alien the spare room . . .)But taken as a whole, this album doesnt have the consistency and sense of completeness of (), which is more of an old-fashioned concept album that should be listened to from beginning to end. This one has your i-pod in mind: download tracks 2,8,9 and 10."
4,"Great music, but the CASE is annoying.","This review is not about the music. It is about the case that the CD is packaged in. While aesthetically clever and unique, the case is larger in width and length than a standard CD case (if there is such a thing). The depth is also reduced to about 1/4 the normal size, almost like a beverage coaster.The only reason this bothers me is because it is too large for my shelves. On the built-in CD rack, designed for ""standard CD cases"", this case simply will not fit in any angle. On a regular shelf where there is no limit to storage size, the only odd thing about the case is that is sticks out farther than other CD cases.I would say ""case closed"", but it's only my observation."
3,Big Noise,"Sigur Ros is an Icelandic band that excels in making elegant noise. On their fourth album, Takk, the band moves away slightly from their funereal drone to a more lively sound. The best example is the gorgeous ""Se Lest"" which a sweet lullaby accenting by a big brass section. This band is not for everyone's tastes, but they make challenging and enjoyable music."
3,Great Album but TERRIBLE packaging!,"Not to take away anything from the music, but anyone with minimal marketing knowledge knows you do NOT go outside the industry defined parameters as far a packaging goes. The Takk CD case is too large to fit in any storage for standard CD Jewel cases rendering it useless to be put in a library. This also means some retailers will not display it alongside other CDs and will be hidden away. Hopefully The label will have enough common sense to re-release it in a standard jewel case."
5,Thanks,"This album is beautiful. I have been informed that this album is in Icelandic opposed to their last album ""( )"" which was in a made up language called ""Hopelandic"". To me, because i dont speak icelandic, the lyrics act as another instrument because of how beautifully they are sung. The whole album is incredibly pretty though, and incredibly powerful. My favorite track by far is track 6 ""Soeglopur"", which vocals actually intrigued me to listen to the band, and all in all probably my favorite song by the band. Overall probably more upbeat than ""( )"", but not quite as good. Not enough to deserve 4 stars, but not quite as good."
5,Providing the sinews of better music,"One of the few musical acts that give me goose bumps, bring tears to my eyes and make my heart swell.Pure and honest audio heaven.Their music incredibly enhances the mood for love, life and imagination.If you're looking for alt-rock, gangsta-rap, reggeaton-dance, Top 40 corporate-pop, or death metal...keep looking.If you're tired of the holding patterns of the above music, and desire something absolutely incredible, stop looking."
4,AAUUGGHH...The Packaging,"A beautiful album, but the packaging is completely useless. Be very careful when you pull out your cd. Be mindful of how the cd is sitting in the pocket. You may have to bend the back cover a bit. Otherwise, Yeah, as one reviewer put it ""Makes you want to move mountains"""
2,Weakest of the 4 SR CDs I own,"Just didn't work for me. I've given it 50 listens over the last couple of years, but get more and more ho-hum as I proceed. Repetitive (well, yeah, what's new) but boringly and tritely so. With 60% of the reviewers giving this one 5 stars, far be it from me to attempt to dissuade anyone, but Ágtis Byrjun is so far above this that Takk sounds as if it was created by some wannabe group. This is a remote #4 in my list of Sigur Ros CDs."
5,Blown Away,"I bought this on a throwout table outside a boring local record shop. I had heard a few things by Sigur Ros before but nothing that really impressed me. I bought this because the cover was so cool. Then I listened to it. Absolute magic. The best thing I have heard for a long time. I have not yet taken out of the CD player and it has been 3 days. Like being dragged through some fantastic dream by a team of naked angels on opium. Before you leave this miserable planet listen to this record, things are not so bad after all."
4,great but not AMAZING,"so this album is totally very, very good. like, on the great side of good. but not amazing (like their second album ""agaetis byrjun""). it sounds like the singer has inhaled much more helium than usual, as there is much more falsetto on this record. the album is also a bit uplifiting (i.e. most of the songs sound kind of on the hopeful side of melancholy, or downright happy.) not to say this is a bad thing at all, just, for me, not as powerful as the deeply somber second album. definitely WAY better than the pretentiously titled (and packaged) third album ""()"", which was on the boring side of opus. ""takk""'s songs are more on the accessible side (if such a thing is possible for sigur ros), which sort of makes them lose some of their magic. all in all, this is still one of the top 10 albums released this year."
4,"IN ICELANDIC, NO LESS","It sounds like a psychotic reaction to a Catholic mass. Something horrified goes running from the church. Bells, chants, booming crescendos, and a glockenspiel tied to a lead weight, go hand in hand with swirling and standard back vocals, (oooh, aaah, oooh), which are about as progressive as The Partridge Family, complimented and compensated by a weird, whimpering lead vocal that sounds like an alien-being with lockjaw attempting to mimic the human voice. Washed over by a wave of alarming, climactic vocal structure, and tinkered by a constant, brainwashing keyboard that sounds like a passive-aggresive hearing test from a very bad nightmare. Accesible? Not if your of this world. I know one thing. I drove down a lonely highway from central New York State to Pennsylvania on a cold stormy winter night, and popped this new CD in the player, and I swear, SOMETHING was trying to take control of the steering wheel."
3,A little to pretty for me,"Still a good album but admidst the good songs there is too much fluff. I feel as if I'm listening to the score of a disney film and I'm supposed to be feel very joyous. The emotions just aren't as deep, jagged and groovy as previous albums. I never want to scream and yell and dance. Mostly I just want to sleep and feel warm fuzzies. Previous albums could make you want to do all of these things in the span of one song."
2,Crescendo fatigue,Crescendo fatigue: becoming both exhuasted and bored after hearing a one musically and emotional similar crescendo after another.
2,the thrill runs thin,"think this album is rather boring, not as good as the previous 2 album, the whole ""cat sound"" is getting out of hand. i rather listen to some 80s hair metal stuff"

3,Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Games Most Wanted,"Good book but written more as a text book, also a little dated but still a good read when pertaining to gaming."
5,A sweet instrument,"I must say that I disagree with those who say that this melodica is useless. I have been a professional saxophone player for the last two years and have been playing saxophone ever since the six grade. I played piano when I was a kid but never really got anywhere because saxophone is my true passion. When I saw this melodica it was like a dream come true. It was small, out of the way and easy to travel with and it came with all the perks, a cool jazzy sound, similarities to the saxophone so I can learn quickly and overall good quality. Because I am a saxophone player I can tell you that with practice you can achieve a lot of fingering fluidity and if you already are a sax player then more power to you. It's rich sound and jazzy feel are only the beggining of boundries you can reach and cross with this great instrument. You'll love it!"
4,"Works as designed, but","Been using now or a few weeks, arrived in good working order, with no problems. Good on dubbing our old home moved from VHS to DVD-R's and such. Have not read the manual yet, so need to learn how to do the chapters but we do like the machine.One flaw, no high def input, it is not a high def machine, so can't be to surprised, but I did figure I could do a higher resolution input from my HD Sat box, and get at least a decent recording on the DVD, well ya can't. top input is S-Video. So keep that in mind if you intend to take external input and record it. Otherwise fine machine."
1,CRAP and CRAP,"If I could give it 0 stars I would.Purchased 2 .........absolute JUNK. I will never buy Pany again. DVD carshed within 2 weeks. VHS backs up 2-3 min. over what is already taped for next recording. When DVD did work, it would not recognize various DVD, even factory. JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought a refurbished unit for the sole purpose of transferring my old VHS's onto DVDs. My first attempt worked fine. However, after that I could never get it to record onto the DVD. I called customer service and had someone walk me through the steps again just to be sure it wasn't operator error. In short, the unit failed after one use."
5,vCr and DVD recorder,I really do like this newer version of the Panasonic Recorder... It is much easier to finalize your recordings and has a lot of great features that I didn't find with the older model. thanks. MaryLou Lueb
1,"Poor editing features, not user friendly",I was sold on all the advertised features but did not realize until after I purchased a unit that you can not edit RW discs. You can do no more than delete the entire recording. There is no VR recording mode for re-writable discs which means you can not edit out commercials. A waste of money for me. All the features in the world are useless if you can't edit what you record.
3,compatibility,"Looking at the other comments, I just want to add that you need to use media that the other device you want to use can handle. For instance, some computers come with DVD drives that can only run DVD+ or DVD- disks."
3,I.LINK Firewire DV Camcorder Recording Date Time Stamp Problem,"Here is a BIG problem with this unit--it does not transfer date/time stamp information from camcorder to the DVD when using /i.LINK/firewire/DV input. It took me a while and a few calls to Panasonic Tech support to find this out. Finally I saw ""The date and time information on the tape in the DV equipment will not be recorded"" buried in the manual for this on Page 57. Imagine not having the important date and time information on the recorded DVD's--a big disappointment for otherwise a good unit. The date/time stamp information does get transferred when using a PC directly to capture video through Firewire card."
1,Is this unit record on dvd or vcr while watching the same tv show?,"I watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also. If properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to TV, Is this unit record the show while watching the same show on TV? (Some of the units can not record while you are watching the show, TV has to be off !!!!!!)"
5,Great printer for the price,I purchased this printer to replace a laser printer I had for many years and this one is awesome for the price of under $100. Nice type and is pretty speedy for general home use purposes.
3,Bluetooth Sunglasses,Earphones have limited range of movement which makes it difficult to fit for smaller heads. Oakley Thumps have that movement but you will pay for it. There are not that bad considering the cost.
2,Very thin walls,"Let me start out by saying that functionally, the stock pot is just fine. And as far as measuring up to the specified 20 qts, well, yes, it certainly does. However, I was disappointed when it arrived to find a decent sized dent in the side of the pot. I applied slight pressure, and it popped right back into shape, leaving a slight crease in the metal at that spot. I've seen much sturdier pots at local chain stores at very close to the same price since I purchased this one, which I probably would have been happier with altogether (effectively same price, considering I'd have to pay tax but not shipping if purchased locally, and vice versa from an Amazon merchant)."
1,game didnt work,I bought this game for my brother right after christmas. Didnt see any bad reviews. My brother recieved the package on time but the game wouldnt play. There r no scratches on it at all i dont understand this
1,Way to short and way to easy,"I rented this game and it's EASY! I did the first three levels and stopped.It's also boring except for one level. I wouldn't recemend this game.If you want to beat a game, rent this game."
4,"Fun, but short!!","The game was fun but extremely short!! I beat it in like, 2 hours! This is a fun game, but if you like challenging games and are a video game pro, then I dont recommend this game."
3,Madagascar PS2,"Before I saw the movie my mom bought me the game. I thought that it would be perfect for my age because it was rated E-10. But it turned out that when i started playing it, before i knew it I was on the 4th level. The game is super easy, and i beat it in 2 days. It had a couple of fun features like being able to play like Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman, but that was about it. This game isn't worthy of and E-10 rating. It was kind of repeatitive and it was really short. So if you want to try out the game I definetly recommend renting it before you buy it. This game is for kids in the younger age group, not for ten years old and up."
4,only a 1 player game,We rented this game for my kids to play with each other. The game is labeled 1-2 players but is made for only one player at a single PS2 console. The kids are disappointed because now they have to take turns watching each other. Be aware.
3,RATED WRONG AGE GROUP....,"My 12-year-old daughter wanted this game, and completed it in less than 4 hours. Much, much too easy and MUCH too short for this age group. It would be best for kids 6-10. It did have great graphics, but we were very disappointed with the overall game. Not much play value for the money if you buy it for someone over 10."
4,Excellent Imitation of 40's Big Band and Swing,"Big Band and Swing music has been basically dead since the early 1960's. But Bill Elliot has been performing Swing in the Los Angeles area for over a decade to select groups. This is a first rate album, and don't be scared by the price. You can call the number on the back of the CD (310) 459-1717 or log onto studio8h.com/swingorch and get the CD direct. Sorry, Amazon. I buy 3-4 CD's a month from you, but a $50 CD is unacceptable."
4,Great early Ska from the originators,"I was stunned when I found this at the local electronics flea market last month, and the seller was rather strict in his pricing - $4 IIRC. But never having found this release anywhere else, it was hard to not pass up. A French import release of early Skatalites? Awesomesauce!My copy has 12 tracks, using UPC 3307514441129 and copyright year of 1997; though the vinyl was originally released in 1969. The label release number is JET SET 44 411-2 and is in a clear jewel case. A good listen of early ska, with the transfer of analog to digital not having any issues with my ears (though there is a disclaimer on the back art (BART) that some tracks are below standards. If so, I did not hear any issues - or perhaps I was just enjoying the tunes?If you find this release, I would suggest picking it up and enjoying some ska direct from the roots."
4,"No Frills, Low Down Blues","I only have one other John Mooney recording (Late Last Night), which I like. But I have seen him live in New Orleans. After a smoking set, he shocked me and all in attendance by coming out for his encore without his guitar, and singing acapella, a spiritual hymnall, the Son House style. That element of surprise is heard on Gone To Hell. John achieves his own style on this recording while clearly influenced by some of the greats of the Delta Blues. He has a scaled back sound, with usually only drums and bass backing him, but occassionally keyboards too. The songs are not francy, but original. They have momentum. The only thing fancy is John's slide work which is done appropriately. Johns vocals are gritty, yet soulfull. I think Tom Waits fans would like this artist. I like John Mooney because he is a skilled original artist who honors his roots, and that is reflected in Gone To Hell."
3,Good but not the best,"OK - got this even though some folks did say it seemed a bit less intense than other Mooney recordings. I'd have to agree - it has more of a mainstream sound to me than his other CD's. That given, it's still a good CD, still has some good guitar work and some fun piano as others have noted - but I really couldn't identify a favorite song - all seem pretty equal. So - recommend as a good overall CD, just not the best."
3,A guilty pleasure...,"Ok, first the bad news. This book really has no set plot, it relies on coincidence entirely too much. However, having said that it's just darn fun. The characters-both our normal guys and the others are well drawn and true to form."
3,Not so good,"Hawaii, the previous Llamas'album, was much more interesting. Here, there are too much dots and lops, and less lushly strings and horns, less melopeia."
4,Do You Want Suspense!,"A sixth grade boy and his 2 friends are going cave exploring. They are interested on a reward that was posted, they had to find indian relics. They find a mysterious cave and explore it, now they might be trapped in there for ever!"
3,Appear to be some math errors in this book,"I find this book to be well organized and easy to read. There is a great deal of useful material that does not go over anyone's head.I think there are some math errors - I looked mostly in the CAPITAL BUDGETING chapter. On page 328, the present value of 3.3073 should be 3.0373 with disasterous results.On page 348, the formulae for Standard Deviation appear to be totally wrong. Frankly I am amazed by these errors and they put most of the of math the book into serious question. I didn't continue into this chapter after this as I no longer trust the math - so beware and check for yourself.This is unfortunate - except for some simple yet devastating errors, I like the book a great deal. Just too bad."
3,"Story good, God's message so so.","The story was intreguing, clever, and well written. Archeologist travels to Jerusalem, does some digging, finds clues about the Urim and Thummim, and then goes to the deserts where he finds it. He then hooks it up to his computer and dialogs with God on a number of subjects. Cool. I researched the UT quite a lot over the years and I liked his story just fine. However, I found the dialog part preachy and boreing. I give it 2.5 stars."
4,Facinating Read,"I had found this book in a library several years back and the title intrigued me. The storyline and concept was interesting and before I knew it, I was hooked. Of course it could use a little more editing but within its pages are some real conceptual jems, and eyeopening ideas and concepts. I think one can find some unique perspectives that are not too far from the real possibilities. It is certainly one of my favorite books. The author has a few things dead set accurate or at least what I would consider so."
4,The Reason Tasca is a Great Manager,"This book opens our eyes. Sure, we feel that we know what we should be doing. Many times we are right in our hunches. Yet, we still do not always do what needs to be done. Instead, out of either laziness or taking the easy road, we fail because it is so easy to do so. Besides, the customer will always walk in the door. Right? As this book reminds us, the customer may never be back. It is in the insight of a professioanl like Tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know. Again, our implementation of these rules which he explains simply, we will achieve. Another book I encourage is ""Cars and People: How to Put the Two Together."""
3,"Work fine, A little noisy","A little noisy compared to others I've heard, but works fine. If I were to purchase again, I would probably get a see-thru blender, you have to stop blending and remove the lid to see if your concoction is blended to the level you want."
3,Not the original artists,I can't really provide a review of this single since I've never heard it. I just wanted to correct the review above. Casual Sweaters is a knockoff group who redid Lovefool. The Cardigans originally recorded this song and they are the group that appears on the Romeo & Juliet soundtrack. The Cardigans also released several albums prior to and after Lovefool.
2,POOR PICTURE QUALITY - NICE SCENES,"I've seen the whole series on TV and noticed it is based on the org. series of ABC KANE by filmer Hugo van Lawick. It's a pitty it's decided to spare on tape cost,these are poor copies on Extended Play format delivering blurred soft focus, this in contrast to the tv-transmissions and my original tapes. Remastered sound gets a 4*!..."
3,SCI-FI MURDER!!!!!,"Early murder mystery with elements of sci-fi. The Alpha DVD is not that great, but acceptable. However, there does seem to be some missing footage"
3,Doris Farrington is in for a shock,"The brilliant recluse Dr. Farrington (Frank Ball) has just completed his invention. The VXO Accumulator, a device that can harness the sun's rays and offer free energy to everyone. He discloses this information to his friend Judge Folger (Phillip Smalley) and plans to give it to the world tomorrow.Wait! What's this? The lights go out. When the lights come on Judge Folger is dead and soon Dr. Farrington disappears.The search for Dr. Farrington goes on by his daughter (Josephine Dunn) and soon-to-be son-in-law (Jack Mulhall.) Meanwhile we have mysterious viewers, long fingered creeps, hidden panels, and it appears that someone will be murdered at dawn.This is a 1932 black-and-white whodunit. The only version I saw was the Alpha video DVD. It needs a little cleaning up."
3,Not Mcmurtry's best,"I read this book after reading Lonesome Dove, and was not tremendously impressed. I'm a big Mcmurtry fan, having read several of his other books, and must say that this one is a bit weaker than his others. It is very quick and easy to read, however, and did interest me enough that I bought The Late Child (the sequel)."
3,A Faded Rose,"I love McMurtry's writing -- but this is far from his best. The weakness in this book is the main character: Harmony is powerless, easily intimidated and willfully blind to what goes on around her. Yes, she's a nice enough person, but she lacks the strength to take any decisive action in her life. Her daughter, Pepper, is energetic and domineering, even somewhat ruthless. Harmony watches her daughter's rise in life, but cannot seem to understand it or learn from it. She is, at the end of the book, as unfocused and weak as she was at the beginning. It's true that not every novel has to be a ""bildungsroman."" Still, I wanted to see Harmony open her eyes and show some spunk."
2,One of Larry's Many Trashy 80's Novels !!!,"I have read many of McMurtry's works from the 80's and find them to be quite trashy and immoral and other such nonsense. However, why do I keep reading his second rate novels??? Because I love the way he writes. Sure his plots are thin and his characters are rarely upstanding in everyway (not to mention having the same characters with different names and the old ladies in his books always die of cancer, etc.) McMurtry wrote quite a few of these little ditties that take only hours to read...but worth it if you like words........"
5,"Stunning, lyrical novel","Poignant, beautiful, complex character-driven novel a must for McMurtry fans."
1,Whose Kidding Whom?,"By setting the price for this extremely short novel, that was written decades ago - $6.00 more than the paperback - Simon & Schuster makes it clear that they don't want you to buy the kindle edition.I suggest you give them what they want.$13.52 for the paperback is also highway robbery, so I suggest you pick it up second-hand.The Dessert Rose isn't in the same class as classics like Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment, etc. but it's still vintage McMurtry, e.g. The Last Picture Show, Texasville, Dwayne's Depressed...BTW while were on the subject of Larry McMurtry - who got an Oscar for the screenplay - I highly recommend Willie Nelson's classic: I Ain't Goin Down on Brokeback Mountain."
5,Loved this book!!,I loved all of the quirky characters in this book. Harmony's optimism in the face of the reality of her life is inspiring. I can't wait to read the sequel to find out what happens.
1,THE DESERT ROSE,"I must admit I became a Larry McMurtry fan when I read Lonesome Dove, my first McMurtry novel. Since then I have been disppointed in most of his books I have read. The Desert Rose was a huge disappointment. Had I read Desert Rose first I probably would never have read another of his books. It was trashy from beginning to end. Was it really necessary to use the f word so often? Perhaps the book is a true picture of the Las Vegas showgirl scene. There many, many, many better books to read. Your time could be better spent."
1,Handle fell off after 1 week...,"I purchased the 9 quart Coleman Excursion to carry my lunch to work. I was replacing a two year old Rubbermaid 10 quart cooler that had served me well, but had begun to break down. After lightly packing lunch in the Coleman Excursion for five days, the handle unexpectedly fell off, spilling the coolers contents onto the sidewalk. Further examination showed the lack of a detent, or positive snap-in locking feature to keep the handle in place. A quick waste of $20..."
4,Keeps things very cold!,"This cooler keeps things very cold! We left it on our kitchen counter overnight, and the next morning, there was still ice in it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought I was buying a bigger cooler. I think the description could have been better."
3,no devider,We bought this cooler because it came with a devider that seperates drinks from food. This cooler did not have one
5,meh,"Unless you have never touched a mac before, this book is pretty weak. It arrived quickly and was pristine, but, look elsewhere for better instruction."
2,Not enough coverage,"I usually like Robin Williams' books but I am reallly disappointed with this one. I can't even find anything about the expose feature which is one of the main new features for Panther. If she doesn't cover this, I am wondering what else is missing. I really feel like I was cheated out of my money. This book might be useful to someone who isn't familiar with Mac OS, but it won't help anyone looking for new features in Panther."
1,Gamecube GForce Controller,"The Turbo Button would turn on randomly while playing a game.The controller caused portions of the game to activate. As an example, one game had a shield that would turn on and off by its self. It was as if the controller had a mind of its own.I would NOT purchase this item. IT does not work consistently.Although it is very inexpersive, it is not worth even the postage!"
2,Potential Opportunity Lost,"Shallow and self centered and in the end misses the opportunity to be inspired.In conclusion to the search, this lovely, supposedly enlightened women, still needed a man to feel complete or okay. The message being no matter how successful and beautiful, a women needs a man.So 1960's message and disempowering."
3,I was surprised.,"I have loved everything Julia Roberts has been in, up to Eat Pray Love. The story line is a common theme; Someone cheating in a marriage, feeling lost, needing to leaving it all behind to find oneself. Javier Bardem was great in the part, what a hottie. But Julia, She lacked something that I was looking for in her character."
2,a lame as I expected it to be,"I did not read the book, but I know there was a lot to the story. No way to cram it all into a movie and yet they had time for boring dance scenes that went on forever."
2,A total dud,"This movie misses the mark in every way. It never becomes clear what demons Gilbert is wrestling with, she doesn't seem to really learn anything from her travels, and the big questions of life are barely even hinted at, much less seriously engaged. Having sugary Julia Roberts play Gilbert only makes all of this worse. And to top it off, the movie is drainingly boring, with even the scenery failing to generate interest. In short, the movie lacks both substance *and* style.I hope the book is better than the movie. More importantly, I hope the real Elizabeth Gilbert has more depth than the shallow character presented to us.Not recommended, not even to waste time ... on second thought, maybe this movie would work well as a sleep aid."
1,Yawn.,"If you need a sleeping aid, don't take Tylenol PM, watch this instead. Eat, Pray, Love is the second worst movie I have ever seen. It is more interesting to watch your Uncle Rico eat, your Aunt Sarah pray, and even a nonexistent love life would be more interesting cinema than the nearly platonic love relationship of this movie. This movie has beautiful scenery as it is filmed in multiple countries, but a Google image search or travel magazines would produce the same effect. Furthermore, I though gurus were supposed to be wise and interesting. Highly disappointing."
1,Talk about self-absorbed,"This is a looooooooooooooooooooooong boring movie about a self-obsessed woman who really doesn't appreciate how good her life is. Julia Roberts does her best, but this character really needs to look beyond her own self-absorbed 'worries' and do something for others. Couldn't wait for the movie to end - I'd well and truly seen enough after the eat and pray phases. Avoid this movie and if you see the author of the book coming in your direction - get out of the way before she starts griping!"
1,awful,how you you take a stellar cast and create such crap???the book was self indulgent but well writtenevery performance here was falseany producer-director that create a film that makes you hate julia roberts and kills the appeal of james franco and javier bardem is heinousthey should not be allowed to make films for the public again ever
1,Save your money,"I will start off by saying that I hated the book. Hated it! So, why did I watch the movie? Good question. I had hoped it would be better than the book. Still selfish. Still boring.You will love this book if: you are in an unfulfilling marriage and hate your partner; feel like you should be doing something ""better"" with your life; just are not a happy person...If you love your husband and life, you cannot relate to this selfish person. Even Julia Roberts could not make her likeable."
1,Boring,"I enjoyed the book and hoped the movie would be good. It wasn't. I watched as far as her meeting Luca Spaghetti and lost interest. Rent this one if you must, but don't buy it."
2,Such high hopes,The book is much better. The movie *could* have been amazing but I don't think Julia Roberts owned the character very well. Also the cheesy melodramatic music cheapened it a bit. The book was awesome though!
4,Inspiring,"I really liked this movie. It is inspiring to anyone who may be going through life changes such as a breakup or divorce.If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, you may like this movie."
2,Cate Blanchatt,Cate Blanchatt I believe could have been a better fit for the movie. Oh and then there's the screenplay adaptation....lol.
4,Pretty Good Chick Flick,"I bought this as a raffle gift for a small party I had with the girls. We enjoyed watching it and someone went home with the prize. My friends were excited, and everyone loves to win something! Obviously, this is not my kind of movie to keep and watch over and over. If it's your kind of movie, then it's a keeper. The acting and overall movie is well done, and the locations are stunning. If you are a fan of the book, which I'm reading currently - some of the stories/scenes differ in dramatic ways. That's Hollywood for ya."
2,Disappointed,After all the hype I was looking forward to a movie about spiritual growth but this is just another hollywood movie about getting your man. Don't waste your time.
3,"Eat, Pray, Love DVD",Not the best movie I've seen. Way too long and very slow at times. Julia Roberts did not seem to effectively portray the role of Elizabeth Gilbert.
1,Eat pray love DVD review,This DVD had a huge scratch on it and doesn't work at all. I could never get it to play and I was extremely discontent with this product.
3,emotionally and spiritually uplifting--for rich people,"didn't think I would, but I did like this movie. I tend not to care too much for melodramatic movies about the rich and their little problems, but...If you aren't sick of movies about very wealthy people having spiritual crises and going off to find themselves (and extremely handsome lovers), it's worth a watch."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","Julia Robert's character has no brain! That is the first thing that comes to mind, the story doesn't go into detail to explain to the audience why she is so unhappy as we the audience CANNOT find reason for her to BE UNHAPPY. Next ..it seemed as if she coudln't decide anything for herself, people were telling her what to do, what to feel..and its like she couldn't decide where or what to think or do...don't waste your time..the only thing nice about this crazy movie is that the scenery is beautiful but the character comes off as an unthankful woman who really doesn't have reason to jump around continents!"
3,The story is great but......,"once again, as in all her films, you can't get past the fact that it's Julia Roberts playing Julia Roberts and not the character. The book was so darn good and the movie itself is a great filming experience and all the other actors did a fine job. If only the audience could forget and not see all of Julia's expressions and mannerisms, the huge mouth and laugh, it would be rated excellent by me. The Julia cackle has come into every single part she has ever played and when that happens, the viewer is brought out of the film and back to Julia. We know she has a huge laugh and bigger than normal smile but other actors have an English accent or whatever and they change that for a film and make their characters be the characters. Julia can't do that or maybe she can and just doesn't. Every person she plays can't have a cackle in their character, can they??? Other than that, the film is just fine..the story, of course, knowing the book, is enjoyable."
5,Eat Pray Love,I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn about traveling to Italy the religion in India and Indonesia
4,A good watch,"If you like Julia Roberts this is a movie you should not miss, she does a great job. I enjoyed this a lot. I think that something was missing - and am not 100% sure what is was, but being fair it also appears that mant others have a similar view.I do recommend this as it is a non-typical movie, thus; very welcome."
4,Eat pray love,"Again you have went way beyond my expectations. This is a great move and love Julie roberts.Wow!,,,,,Great great!!!!"
3,Just Okay,I read the book prior to seeing the movie and LOVED the book. The details and emotions that so important in the book are not shown in the movie. I loved this book so much and was very disappointed in the movie. Julia Roberts did a good job as always. If you loved the book the movie will disappoint for sure!
2,How does this work?,"I love a film or book about an active, engaged woman, but Liz is no Scarlett. She overcomes nothing but the constant attention of attractive men. In the end, instead of finding herself, she finds Javier Bardem; after a year of eating pasta and drinking wine all day. How does that work? Now there would be a good book!"
2,"Julia, I've never liked you.","I am the sick type who did not even enjoy Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman"". What kind of street walker has such gorgeous teeth? Since this is not a review of that movie, let me ask, ""What kind of middle-aged woman looking for meaning in life has such gorgeous teeth?"" I couldn't buy this movie for a second. What the heck was wrong with her first husband or James Franco or her lovely uptown loft? All middle-aged women looking for life's meaning should have it so hard. They should also have the money and the looks to travel the world, eat pizza, and run into Javier Bardem (without a cattle gun). Avoid at all costs unless you are a huge sap."
1,so after I have read the book...0.05 STARS,"I knew that is a big pile of self absorbed garbage,I dare to rent this crap...in the hope that by miracle Miss Roberts will make the crap smell better!of course not.Crap crap and more crap.We are Americans, we have a middle age crisis and we have money...yea and yes we want to enlighten a little just for fun and see where it goes from there....DO NOT READ THE BOOK AND DEFINITELY DO NOT RENT THE MOVIE"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G and dull!,Nothing happened! I couldn't find a point for the movie. She did eat (a LOT) but with no implied weight gain. She did pray (once). Did she love? I don't think so - just a lot of sex with different partners.I'm just sorry I wasted the money to rent the dvd.
4,Good,I liked the movie. It was long but kept my interest and didn't seem as long as it actually was. I find it interesting for the fact that it is a true story - takes lots of guts to do that.
1,I just wasted a 140 min...,"Waste of time, I knew I did not want to see this movie and I am glad I waited for the video so at least I did not waste my $$ too.Never had the desire to read this book, I think the Author is selfish and needs to get over her self. I hope her ex found a better women to be with one who doesn't leave because she is hungry for pasta!!Boring movie, really disappointed."
2,"Watch, yawn, snooze","I am a huge fan of Julia Roberts and don't mind what people label as chick flicks about self discovery such as ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", but this film is so tedious and self indulgent that I had to watch it over two nights. When I looked at the packaging it was mis-printed and said the running time was 4hours and 46 minutes and it really did feel that long. To be fair, the first portion of the film that took place in Italy was okay, but the rest of it was dull as dirt. I am sure there are those who really enjoyed it, but I was not one. Sorry!"
2,I couldn't even finish.,"Why, oh why, did so many ladies sing the praise of this book and movie? Do I really know that many stupid, dull women? This movie was so lacking in story depth, character (which I understand is what the character was lacking in the beginning, but still!). Sure, it was visually appealing - which is why I gave it 2 stars. If I'd stayed longer for the male rear nudity, maybe it would have gotten 3 stars but I doubt it. After 12 minutes in my daughter and I already wanted to turn it off. And just over and hour we couldn't take it anymore. I think maybe you had to have read the book first to have bonded with the main character. Alas, this movie was made without realizing that most of their audience did not read the book first and we were not going to simply love the movie because Julia Roberts was in it."
2,Ear Pray Love,Love all of Julia Roberts movies but this one was on the bottom of my list. It was just too all over the place. Wasn't sure if she should eat more pray more or fall in love more.Not one of her better movies.
2,Really slow and dull,This movie was not at all what we expected. Based on the cast we expected more than just a story with some actors that moved way too slow with little purpose. Wasted our money on this one.
3,Cliche,"2.5 stars.Here's the movie in a nutshell:1. Woman has mid-life crises and gets divorced.2. Woman has European vacation to find herself.3. Woman travels to India to live in an ashram to solve her existential crisis.4. Woman goes to Indonesia where an Indonesian version of Yoda magically solves all her problems.This is a rather dull and cliche story, striking me as little more than an adult version of ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" The only reason this movie wasn't a bomb is that Julia Roberts is such a good actress.Not recommended."
4,A Loving Journey into Finding Oneself,"I watched this before reading the book, which was a blessing. Having recently finished the book, I found it more in-depth than the movie. That said, I liked this movie a lot. Julia Roberts was (as always) beautiful and believable. The sentiments of the film stayed pretty true to the book, to wit, love yourself and find peace within you wherever you may be. I would watch this movie again and I would recommend it to other people."
3,Not what I expected,I have read the book so in my humble opinion it's usually a mistake to expect much of the movie.
5,Eat pray Love Review,"I came out of this movie and completely broke down. I realized for once that I was not the only one experiancing this. Afterall they made a movie about it. So I must not be alone. Secondly I had advice on how someone else overcame this. I want to purchase it and watch it over again, until I get it. The message is crucial to so many women and I would advise young women to learn from this. I cannot say enough good about this movie. It is life changing, at least it was for me and obviously for others. Saw this with my Mother, when we came out of it she said "" that was about you"". She was right and it helped my healing begin."
3,Eat Pray Love,"I loved the book but the movie was a disappointment. If I would have seen the movie first I would not have read the book. I am a Julia Roberts fan but she wasn't the right lead for the movie maybe because she was a distraction and I couldn't not see ""Julia Roberts"""
3,Eat Pray Love,"The movie was ok. Julia played the part well. But I like lighter movies better. It's a little bit on the depressing mood. I bought this movie as a gift, but after seeing the movie I know my kids won't like it as much as her other movies."
5,Well done!,"The movie captured and recreated the best of the book. Sometimes it felt like it was ""skimming over,"" but if it hadn't, the movie would have been six hours!"
4,Surprisingly Good!,"My wife wanted to get this one ""Eat, Pray, Love"". I thought it was going to be another mushy chick flick, which it kind of was but it was a really good story, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!"
5,Julia is wonderful,I loved this movie! It brought the viewer through so many emotions we women of a certain age go through. Now only if we all could make the life choice to live our dreams.
4,"Eat, Pray, Love This DVD!","The book was great, and this film does a good job of capturing the essence of the interior life of Elizabeth Gilbert. I agree with a friend of mine, Julia Roberts is an excellent actress, however someone less famous would probably have been more appropriate for this role. Kyra Sedgwick would have been my choice. She has the same quirky edge that Gilbert has. All in all the film is good. Director Ryan Murphy is pure joy in what he does with GLEE, but I would have liked perhaps a European director and crew to have made this film or Ryan Murphy could have utilized textures from European films, shadows, solitude, and angst. For some reason the film doesn't quite do that, but all in all I would recommend it. Love Javier Bardem."
1,PERFECT WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY - A MINUS 5*,"Godless, secular, boring, senseless, pointless, rubbish, all about the almighty SELF, poor feelingless non-stop annoying narrating,CRAPPY AND USELESS. A tue story? I pity anyone coming into contact with this fool!"
5,Love the movie / service,The movie came fast and it was great. Who doesn't love Julia? I would rec this movie to everyone. Thanks
2,just OK,"this will be a short review. I feel Julia Roberts was miscast in the role. i usually love all her work, but she just did not fit the part, couldn't show the right expressions or feelings much of the time. And there was no chemistry between her and her hunk Javier. With so many actressess to pick from, i am sure another would have made this a decent movie."
2,"Oh goody, let's make fun of Americans again...sigh","I didn't hate it. I do find it difficult when American actors agree to dialogue that attempts to state American stereotypes as fact. Apparently the American idea of fun is to drink too much and then spend every evening in front of the idiot box...mmm, not terribly accurate. The story is uninteresting. It seems that Liz in incapable of being alone, period. She seems to have a bad habit of expecting others to fulfil her happiness, she doesn't seem to have the ability to do the work and find it on her own. Therefore, she inevitable ends up miserable and can't seem to figure out why. She is a moron. I will give credit to Roberts for allowing herself to be dumpy through almost the entire film. And she is no longer trying to NOT use her trademark laugh, which is nice. Overall, if I had the resources to do what she did, I would have spent my time more wisely."
3,A great film that some people take a little too seriously,"I'm surprised at how many bad reviews this film is getting. Julia Roberts gives a great performance in what is a light hearted film about changing the course of your life. We're not being told to subscribe to the theory on display in the film, but simply to sit back, enjoy and consider some of the things being discussed.Personally, I thought it was great, light entertainment that has a heart. I'm also ordering a copy of the book as I type:)Very enjoyable."
1,awful,"I haven't read the book, but i'm sure that it's very good... But the movie is very awful!! It's very boring too, I was dozing off in the first 20 minutes of the movie."
3,Maybe I would Have Liked It More,"Had I read the book. Found it to be pretentious, way too long, thin on a real plot, and boring. Should have been edited down to the Thanksgiving scene in Italy, the wedding scene in India (and the elephant scene), and everything in Bali.Too wordy and chick flicky. I love Ms. Roberts, but this was just not an interesting enough film to spend nearly 3 hours on."
2,"Slow moving and boring. Otherwise, not very good.","I bought this for my wife for Christmas. We were going to watch it together, but I fell asleep. Does that count as watching it together?"
1,"Big Hollywood, big star, big loss","Watched it with the wife. WAsn't as bad as I expected it to be, but way too long, and am I the only one sick of Julia Roberts fake laugh? I agree with the other reviews that it was very indulgent."
1,Ugh!,There's nothing like spending two hours watching a self-centered woman trying to fulfill herself at the expense of others. I was deeply disappointed and felt myself being increasingly annoyed by the main character as the film dragged on. I was glad when my daughter interrupted me just short of the ending so I had an excuse to turn the thing off. I don't feel compelled to find out how it ends.
2,SLOW,"Dull, uninspired, selfish, and lacking charisma. Julia is a great actress and the scenery where she travels is absolutely beautiful, but the pace and characters were boring."
2,Slow and way too long,"I watch a lot of movies and I like Julia Roberts. But this movie was way too long and just too slow. They could have cut it a lot to make the story move along better. It almost felt painful to finish, but I had to get to the end. Not the worst movie I've seen, but very far from good. Would not recommend."
3,Good Book but the Movie Fails to Succeed,"I wish I'd read some reviews of the movie before attempting to watch it. EAT, PRAY, LOVE, the book, didn't translate at all well to a movie. This film is made up of too many disjointed scenes with brief introductions to characters so you don't really get to know or care about the people. The acting seemed flat. And, though at the beginning of the book, I was bothered by the author's self-absorption, her story grew on me through her depictions of the people who surrounded her in each country, particularly India and Bali. In the movie, she comes across self-absorbed the entire time.I found the interactions with Richard in India and some of the early scenes with the medicine man in Bali somewhat engaging. But overall, I'd suggest reading the book and skipping this movie."
1,Shallow; no value to real life.,"Oh please - what were they thinking?? Another little rich girl gets sympathy for not having everything she wants in life, and applauded for focusing solely on herself. Jumping from one man to another to fill her own emptiness - oh poor baby. If she could travel where she wanted, and eat what she wanted, and enjoy her money, that's fine; but to actually write a book and have a film about your boring self is another thing.No worries about job, money, responsibilities or obligations to others - no wonder she experienced ennui. Now she's even wealthier for publishing the nauseating drivel about her useless life, and we're expected to think of her as courageous and deep. No way.Oh, she leaves the men, but she's the one who's ""heartbroken""??? I'm not saying she should have stayed with them if she didn't want to, but the entire story is so ridiculous."
1,A silly chick flick. Save your money,I'll admit: I can't give a Short Attention Span Summary because I couldn't make it through the whole film. Who knew that a single woman finding herself while backpacking could fill up so much space or make such an intensely boring movie?Save your money.
1,slow and boring,I stopped watching this movie half way through because it was so slow. I won't bore you with a long review
4,Eat Pray Love,"I enjoyed this movie, that is why I purchased it through Amazon. Delivery was fast , first one came damaged .Replacement came quickly and was fine."
2,Travel channel movie,"Too long, a lot of faces (people) without teeth. Just appreciate USA dental care and do not follow J. Roberts. Maybe except of Italy, but be careful there as well."
3,"Eat, Pray, Love","EPL is the consummate ""chick flick"". The theme is that of a young woman searching for inner self and how she learns about life while traveling around the world. The locations are great visually but the characters are saccharin sweet. The ending was fairly predicable. I would not watch this show again, let alone pay for it, but my wife liked it. I can tell because she actually managed to stay awake for the entire program."
3,a bad as the book,"Eat Pray Love is the movie based on the novel of the same title by Liz Gilbert. Julia Roberts is very god at playing the fragile, tearful female, but it is difficult to capture a work with such a lot of inner monologue on film. Still, Liz Gilbert comes across as self-indulgent and self-centred in the movie, just like she does in the book. It's a good screenplay and well-acted: just a pity to waste such a lot of effort on a mediocre novel."
1,Stared with horror at Robert's swollen upper lip the whole time,"The book was insipid. The movie was worse. And, I could not stop staring at Julia Robert's obviously injected upper lip the whole time. It looked so swollen, I wondered if she was suffering an anaphylactic allergic reaction.No, probably just ugly lip plumping injections gone bad."
3,Fun,I liked the process she went thru to find herself has some reminders of runaway bride however didnt like the ending.
2,"Wanted to read book over and over - the movie, not so much","I LOVED this book so much, I re-read it. And I put it on a shelf with my favorite books. The movie was very disappointing, even though I LOVE Julia Roberts in every other movie I have seen of hers.The movie seemed almost plot-less and dull, and I found myself distracted and just waiting for it to end. And I regretted spending the money to purchase it, as I know I will not watch it again."
5,Eat Pray Love,The movie is great!! I had seen it and wanted to own it for myself. The DVD is in brand new quality
1,absolutely BORING,"great movies, are the ones you just LOVE watching again and again. This was not a movie I would watch a second time. It was downright BORING. Couldn't bring across the essence it was trying to display. No warmth in it. Really hopeless. This one should be filed under rotten tomato"
1,Waste of Time,"What a waste of time, talent and money. No point here. Seems Hollywood has gone Bollywood in a bad way. Poor script and surprisingly poor acting."
2,Not Much There,"This is a silly trifle of a movie. I love silly romantic dramedies, but this one tackles deep subjects with the cinematic equivalent of one of those little pink ice cream sample spoons. It's watchable, but not really worth the time."
2,Eat then pray the movie would make sense,"Loving Julia Roberts, and with a great cast I thought this movie would be amazing. How disappointed I was that the movie never reached a level of enjoyment like her previous movies. Visually the movie was beautiul, however the story never really got there."
2,Eat Pray Snore is more like it...,"I'm a big fan of Julia Roberts and get the whole spiritual journey thing, but this movie moved along too slowly. My title for this review says it all."
1,"Snore, Yawn, Fast-Forward","This is one long slog of a dull and pretentious film featuring an equally pretentious, narcissistic twerp who dumps her husband for no good reason and goes on a soul-searching journey in three different countries. She prays a teeny bit, eats some stuff in Italy, talks to a spiritual guide in Bali, and spends an inordinate amount of time in an ashram in India. But so what? None of it amounts to much, and it's so dull that I could hardly stop yawning. I found myself not caring at all what happened to her or to anyone else in the story. I hit the FFWD button on my remote several times because I just wanted it to be over quickly.What a waste of the actors and the locations.Ryan Murphy did a great job with Nip/Tuck and Glee, but he simply cannot handle a feature film."
2,"Worst Julie Roberts Movie, but not her fault","Julie Roberts is a talented actress, and as such, she should have known better than to do this movie. I read the book, which was tolerable at times, and other times just the author going on completely self-centered, bipolar mania rants. The movie was far worse and far more dull. The main character's selfishness comes out more as well. By the title and plot of the movie, you would think the main character is out to find herself by losing herself in other cultures and finding solice in spirituality. But in reality, she is on a vojage to Neverland to escape her problems like a teenager fleeing impending responsibility. The movie portrays the irresponsible side even stronger, which makes the character completely unrelatable. All the parts of the book where the character somehow makes progress to ""find herself"" and has moments of spiritual progress have been cut out of the movie. This movie is rubbish."
1,Julia Hits Rock Bottom,"I'm not a prude, a chauvinist, or delusional, as my old reviews will prove. This book is irrelevant because 99.9% of men will never read it. A 45 year old in rapid succession: divorces against her husband's pleas, rushes into bed with a new guy whom she quickly hates Then she travels around the world, eating 10,000 calories a day without gaining an ounce, embraced by crowds of loving warm new friends, confided in and mentored by wise old men, and rushed into a 2 week sex marathon by a Brazilian stud with a heart of gold. Yes ladies, celebrate all your crazy decisions. A long string of male mentors and lovers will magically fix you."
5,A favorite!,"I have read the book and while the movie is more ""Hollywood"" than the read, this is a must-see for anyone who has gone through, or is going through, major changes in life. Inspirational, funny, and romantic. Do not pass this up!"
1,THE SCENERY IS NICE...,"OK, so the meaning of ""Eat Pray Love"" is to not work on your relationship (dumping your partner/spouse in the process so you can go ""find yourself""), travel to Europe where fabulous people will automatically befriend you, meditate a lot but don't let go of the emotional baggage, do one nice thing for a less-fortunate, and snag yourself a hot rich guy with whom you have awesome sex. Wow, how shallow."
2,"Great book, awful movie adaptation","I loved reading the book. It brought me to places, ideas, tastes, smells and feelings of each experience Elizabeth encountered. It was nuanced with her challenges and internal struggles. I was really looking forward to an evening with this movie and a glass of wine.The movie was a great disappointment. Julia Roberts portrayed her character with very little depth and I actually never cared for Elizabeth. I found her whiny, needy and stupid. There was also zero chemistry between Elizabeth and Felipe.This was 2 hours of my life I will never get back. And I feel it soured me on the overall book experience also. ugh."
3,8 Reasons to watch this movie...,1 Javier Bardem2. Bali3. Javier Bardem4. Bali5. Javier Bardem6. Bali7. Javier Bardem8. Bali
1,Ruined the book!,"I read the book and was surprised how much I liked it. Very honest and amazingly wise. Then I saw the movie. What a mistake Gilbert made to agree to it! It made her awakening experiences trivial, her honest emotions sentimental. I could hardly bear to watch it. A terrible script and poor casting choices. Don't see the movie. Read the book."
1,This had to be the worst movie I've ever seen,"I haven't walked out of many movies in my life, but this was one of them... Dreary, meandering, pointless and even more self-indulgent than the book, this film was truly awful."
4,Read the book first.,"I usually don't watch a movie based on a book I really like because it is almost always disappointing. Even though so much of the wonderful background had to be left out, the movie did a great job of fleshing out the characters. I thought the casting was brilliant. Only Roberts could have pulled off this part and made it believable. Her non-classic beauty and charisma can make one believe that a single, non-wealthy woman could plunge into three different cultures and find the best and brightest."
3,Little slow,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie as Julia Roberts is one of my favorites, however this was slow getting into, maybe just too much deepness with out enough fun and action."
2,Book is so much better,"I just read the book and went right out and got the movie hoping that it would enhance my experience reading the book. I am so disappointed. The book is funny and the people are likable. This movie is heavy, slow and so sad. I was bored and a few times so tired of Julia Roberts (even though I like her). This is a hollywoodtised book/movie that does not work. Sorry, I really wanted to like it. Loved loved the book."
1,Not satisfied,I notified this company within the time frame they failed to responed and now I stuck with a movie that does not work. I bought this film for my mom. I should of went to target and just bought the film. Now the company wants to say I never contacted them or within the amount time. Defected material is defected material. I order alot from this website and so do alot of people I know. I would rather pay full price or go to a store then purchase from people who sell defective materials.
5,Love it,Loved tha book and definitely loved the movie. Its always nice when they stay very close to the book and dont change the story. Very inspirational story. I would recommend it to everyone who are on a spiritual journey.
1,I never got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I never got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I bought and paid for it but you never even Mailed it to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please send me something so I know you got this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,not as good as the book,"I don't really know If I've enjoyed the movie as a whole or I just enjoyed watching my beloved Julia Roberts bringingLiz Gilbert to life . The book was really thick and full of information and I believe Ryan tried to summarize the book focusing only on the important things ( which I'm sure was not the easiest task ), so eventually the movie looked like couple of random scenes were glued together :D . however I enjoyed the movie it has good cast and great sceneries."
2,Horror vacui,"Yawn.One star for the phony pretentious banality of the story.One more star for some good nature shots in Bali. I would give more for the Bali part, out of patriotism, if it were not so artificial. Even the market scenes are staged (did you notice how all people in the market are foreigners?). The Indonesian protagonists (the old man and his wife, the single mother and her child) are cliches and unreal.Waste of time."
2,Long vacation,"This tedious and boring chick flick is essentially the story of a self indulgent rich woman who decides to take a year's vacation abroad. Beautifully filmed, otherwise I'd give it one star. I hope the book was better, it has to be."
3,"Disappointing, just ok.","I really hoped to discover more classic Greek songs, but didn't care for any of the new ones. The best Greek album of Mouskouri's is still ""An Evening with Belafonte and Mouskouri,"" the sheer beauty of both voices and the simplicity of the arrangements to let the beauty of the songs shine through. I found this live album to be overly orchestrated and produced.A music lover"
5,A terrific find at the Picasso Musuem in Paris,"What a gem I was lucky to stumble upon during a Saturday afternoon stroll into the Picasso Museum in Paris!This book, published in 1987 by the Museum, has a wonderful collection of black and white photographs taken by the Brassai -- a Transylvanian-born journalist turned emigre photographer in Paris -- of Picasso, Picasso's works (including sculpture and art), and Picasso's studio. Brassai (1899-1984), to whom Picasso turned as his personal photographer, is also world renowned for his photos of Paris where he engaged in multiple interests in art, literature, sculpture and cinema. Brassai also collaborated in other ways with Picasso, the painter and sculptor, including through various dialogues the two mutually admiring artists held, glimpses of which come through in the pages of this book.Brassai's photographer's eye, which makes this book a visual feast, is the subject of comment by other admirers in this book, including Henry Miller."
2,Chloe,"I'm usually not one to put a book down and never finish it.....until now. Searching for a book to read at the library last week, I stumbled upon this book 'Chloe'. The description sounded interesting enough, so I picked it. I wanted to like this book, really. It started out okay, I loved Theran, but that was about it. I had a hard time liking any of the other characters, and it felt that they had no emotion or real depth to their characters, with the exception of Theran. But about the time Chloe and Minnie started modeling, I was feeling like this book had no point and was going nowhere....very slowly, and I got bored with it. A few times I put the book down and had to ponder 'what is the point of this story?' and 'why should I care for these characters?', and after that I just had no desire to pick it up again. It seems to me it could have been a good story if it had a more interesting plot and a little more excitement to the characters. But it just fizzled out way too fast."
2,Just regular,"I am giving only 2 stars to this CD because, though featuring really ""famous"" names such as Bartoli and Terfel, the overall sound is not as good as one expects it to be, maybe due to sound technicians, I could not say.But what I think it's WORST about this album, is the Laudate Dominum (from Visperae de Confessore, by Mozart) performance by the Santa Cecilia Academy Choir. Being a choir alt singer myself and having sang the piece a few times, it pierces my ears to hear the altos out of tune IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE CHOIR SCORE!!!! How could the recording company put this in the market? Did nobody in the recording notice it? And the choir conductor? I would be ashamed of having a recording of my choir out of tune."
4,Good mid value boot,"I'd say they run slightly big is the only downfall. Wear thicker socks and it's no problem though. Good mid level quality and price boot. If you're putting on more than 5-8K miles a year then upgrade to a better boot. Casual 3-5K mile riders like me, works great. Riding a VFR800 with them."
5,An excellent training course,"I really enjoyed this book - it took just 3 or 4 hours to read, and that included experimenting with all the features that the book introduced. This book tells everything one needs to know to write a basic web page."
1,Not what I thought.,"For $50, these weren't the color I expected, so I sent them back. I thought they'd be more peachy in color, but they just look pink to me, and I already had pink pearls."
2,"For archivists, not listeners","I have two recordings of this opera - this Bongiovanni/Corti/Amou CD based on Rossini's Vienna version of 1822; and a tape of his initial Rome version of 1821, performed as an oratorio in Paris in 1981. Both versions are authentic, but the Paris recording flows with an immediacy and urgency that make this CD set a real let-down in comparison. I particularly regret the absence on the CD of a perfectly electrifying tenor aria in Act 2 (borrowed, actually, by Rossini from an earlier opera - but that's Rossini). If the Paris production were available on CD, I would recommend it without reserve and would pay almost any price for it."
4,Exhilerating,"This is a rather uneven opera and performance. The libretto is weak and indeed silly, but for Rossini, especially when we are only talking about the audio part of a performance, that is not very relevant and this work has a great deal of complicated and exciting music. The conducting by and large is very good with a great deal of enthusiasm, moving things along in a brisk though not very nuanced fashion, and the singing is by and large accomplished. The exception, unfortunately, is Akie Amou singing the title role. She has a huge and very agile voice that can be beautiful, but it is not always under control and her high loud notes, especially in a crescendo, often become ugly shrieks -- mal canto rather than bel canto. Despite this, this is a very enjoyable set, recommended to those who are beyond the standard Rossini works -- which are indeed better material and have better performances."
5,Personal favorite,"I've had no problems whatsoever with this item; it's an absolute delight. Gorgeous color, high-quality make, and the vibration goes from gentle to surprisingly strong on a full set of batteries. Speaking of batteries, they lasted much longer than I thought they would. Plus it's waterproof, which is always nice. Couldn't ask for a nicer introduction toy."
4,Pretty good,"This has fairly good vibration levels, and the best part about it for me personally is the fact that it is NOT flexible. Even though it is ridgid, the surface of it is still soft, i.e. jelly as the name states. Overall, I am very, very happy with this product and would absolutely buy one again in the future."
2,Not as strong as described.,"This vibrator is not as strong as it is described, I was disappointed with the poor quality of the vibrator cap and how difficult it was to get the batteries in and out as well. Made more noise than actual motion."
4,Shower Time Fun,My husband bought me this for Valentine's Day. I don't normally like vibrators but it's an amazing addition to my shower routine. It is just the right size and it is very discreet. The controls are very easy to use and can be adjusted with only one hand. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Amazing,I purchased this last week. It only took about 5 days to get here. And I finally got the package today and I was so excited. This is my first toy and I was excited to have it so soon. It is waterproof so I did take a shower just to test it out. It isnt the biggest thing in the world. But It is a really good size. I love how you can adjust the speed to the way you like it. It takes 2 AA batteries so make sure you have those. But I would recommend have lube. I was in the shower so It wasnt really a big deal to me. The texture is amazing and the vibrations are great.! I would deffinately recommend this to someone. However make sure you clean it with a mild soap and hot water. I used baby shampoo. But So far I LOVE IT!
3,Not bad,"Overall this if a fine toy, gets the job done, but the bullet inside mine was not located where it is in the picture, making it less flexible than it should be. The motor was a little weak for me and has also begun to die already even though it's only a few months old. I think I may have just gotten a bad one, but I'm not as pleased as when I first purchased it."
1,too small,"Are you kiding me? The add should state what is on the package ULTRA THIN. Yea it's 6 1/2"" long but it's 1"" diamater. The add says 2"". not even close! forget about it..........."
1,does not work!!!,I was so excited that it arrived and the shipping was so quick then I opened it and put fresh batteries to find that it does not work!!! Very upset and its non returnable now what?! I just want a working one!!
4,Good basic vibrator,This vibrator is very basic but certainly gets the job done. Personally I have found that it is a better clitoral massager. If you are looking for something very basic this is great. It is not all that quiet but can easily be hidden with the sound of a TV or radio. Good couples toy too. The girth is somewhat smaller than (at least in my case) a man's penis. It can be used vaginally or anally if you are trying to work up to anal sex.
5,Great toy,"This was the first vibrator/toy that I have bought for myself, and it's quite nice. No gross plastic smell, shipped discretely (and fast - I was told that it would arrive on the 19th, it arrived on the 1st), and is well packaged. The ""jelly"" is a bit hard, likely harder as the motor is near the tip (just where the frenulum would be, for reference), however I didn't find this to be an issue. The colour is very nice as well, a deep cobalt blue. Easy to clean and very quiet - the noise of a shower easily covers even the highest vibration setting."
2,Dissapointing,"Disappointing, it has a nice feel and all, but the vibrator is really weak. Also the switch is placed terrible, when you are turning it down, or off, it's very easy to unscrew it and have the batteries fall out. The switch is literally on top of the place where you screw the cap off. Also it's tough to turn, and really hard to adjust when it's in."
1,Superball,"Pros: Good Vibrating power from low to high settings. So far after many months and battery changes it has been reliable even with water based and silicone based lubes. It wasn't expensive.Cons: Too hard, not very pliable, not really jelly like as title would lead you to believe. It seems more like really firm rubber similar to an old school superball. Mrs. doesn't enjoy it; says it's uncomfortable & usually hurts. Not sure if it's the shape of the head or the girth being larger than the rest of the shaft before the head/tip which seems weird to me. It actually makes the tip/head seem rather small in comparison to the rest of it. All of this is hard to see from the stock photo, but more easily observed when in hand so buyer beware.Other Thoughts: For us it's better at massaging the exterior than the interior. Perhaps, I will just melt it down to make a large superball."
1,Do Not Buy,"This vibrator is exactly what you pay for, cheap, weak, and rough. If you want something actually satisfying, don't hesitate to spend more money. I used this product once or twice and haven't since. Never in my life have I been more frustrated while trying to get off. It's a piece of crap. Not worth it in the slightest."
4,Pretty neat,"pretty good little toy, I bought for my girl just to spice things up a little. its her first one so we didnt want anything to crazy, but will be upgrading soon! Its a good little toy, not quite big enough though, but she says its good so i guess thats all that matters... she just really like the vibration and ability to take it in the bath. overall good little toy, powerful little vib, and provides lots of pleasure!"
4,Best Product By Far,*The batteries (when inserted) LAST!* The texture is very pleasant and parts are realistic*high quality and easily cleaned* Both fun for me and me+boyfriend
1,o_O,Save your $'s. Does not have various vibration speeds as noted in product discription.Size also not as stated... will move forward purchasing a new product.
1,Not what I expected,Wasn't as big as I thought it was suppose to be. Was looking for something bigger and a lot longer.
1,To small,"Very small, my wife does not feel anything, she hate it, she say it is better to play with their hands. Waste of money and time"
2,its ok,"its great that its waterproof, Could of been bigger and thicker for me but thats my own preference to it, I wasnt to impressed with the speed of the vibrations, but to each there own"
2,Not very good,It's too hard and the vibrator made me feel uncomfortable. The vibrator can not been controlled. I don't like that.
5,Very cute piece,"This is a nice Burberry cosmetic bag. Very sturdy. The zipper is a little hard to open though, I guess you have to break it in (hopefully). Thought the material would be softer but I like that it's not after all. Looks like it can stand alot of wear and tear. This is a nice piece to have or give as a very inexpensive (classy) gift. Comes with a Burberry cloth bag to put it in and a small burberry tag inside."
1,a great disappointment,"I am a huge Diana Palmer fan, and have read everything she has ever written. I usually lover her books and there is usually no question the book is going to be well written , have a great story line and good flow. This book was definately the exception. While reading the book I kept waiting for the story line to get interesting but it just never happen. I took me a very long time to get through this book and when I finally did I felt like I had just wasted my time and money. I even went so far as to return the book because it was so bad. I was sadly disappointed. So anyone reading this review I'm not knocking Diana Palmer's books just this one. Any other book written by Mrs. Palmer is well worth the money spent on it just not ""Trilby"""
2,Trilby,"This book had a strong story line, chRcters wer e well developed. He had suspense enogh to hold your interest. Four Stars."
1,"Hoffer - old, disproven science - repackaged and remarketed","I'm surprised that they are still publishing books on this old, disproven theory. Many research groups tried to duplicate Hoffer's megavitamin theories for treatment of schizophrenia, but nobody could.The good news is that there are some new amino acids that ARE showing strong positive benefits in schizophrenia and have the multiple clinical studies done by different academic groups - that support the claims being made. Look into these amino acid approaches to therapy (glycine and n-methyl-glycine / sarcosine ) and read about the new studies in this area. Do a search on Glycine and schizophrenia and you'll find the reearch."
1,DON'T BUY IT!! BOWEL OBSTRUCTION,"This bone single-handedly caused my Doberman puppy's bowel obstruction. After a 3 hour, $2000 surgery, it looks like she will be ok. Thank God. But the vet pulled huge chunks of this out of her stomach and intestine. So please do not let your dog have this. If you must, give them a dura chew."
1,Watch out!,"My puppy loves nylabones and it usually takes him a few months to start to rip off the pieces of the bone. However, with this bone, he worked on it for one day and had eaten the entire top part off. By the time I had seen what happened, I was looking around for the pieces, hoping he spit them out. Well, obviously he didn't because he spent the night throwing up the pieces of the nylabone. I will not be getting this kind of nylabone again."
5,My puppy LOVES these!!,My puppy cannot get enough of these....she is a very strong chewer and these keep her busy for HOURS!!!
2,"Not ""Souper"" for my dog","My puppy does not like this bone. There is really nothing wrong with it, it's a bit heavier than I expected for a pup. He just doesn't like it, and he's a professional chewer. I guess you never know until you try...."
4,Fantastic album!,"Goblins Club is an absolute fantastic album! ""Lamb with radar eyes"", ""Rising Haul In Silence"",""at darwins motel"",towards the evening star""""on cranes passage"" ""elf june and the midnight patrol"" they are all magnificent tracks! and the title track ""united goblins parade"" are suberb. :-) ""sad merlins sunday"" is the only weak track on this release. Thanks Edgar & Jerome & Linda."
3,"Not spectacular, but a decent album","Tangerine Dream's musical direction seemed to be somewhat scattered after Paul Haslinger left the band in 1991. By 1996, TD had been comprised of Edgar Froese, his son Jerome Froese and on-again off-again member Linda Spa.The music, although well structured and performed, seems to be a bit passionless and contains less of a ""techno"" element than their previous year's release, Tyranny of Beauty.The album does have some memorable songs (Sad Merlin's Sunday is excellent), but overall it seems to leave the average TD fan a little flat.It's worth a listen every now and then, but TD has done much better things before and after this release."
5,Poetry in Motion,"I AFFIRM/I am who I am/and love who I amWhen I opened ""Musings of a Mocha Sista"" to scan a few poems, I happened to open the book up at ""I Affirm."" Though the author wrote the poem for ""her systagyrls,"" much of it is relative to self-love within both men and women.Although I am more of a fiction reader, but love to hear poetry as a spoken word, I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Musings of a Mocha Sista."" It is rare that a poet stretches his or her wings, and the author does that with elegance through her poetry, short stories, and essays.This book is certainly a Bible for loving self and embracing spirituality. The author sums up something that the American Black community needs to live and learn by: love each other/support each other/cause we's be/on da black side chile."
2,"Well executed, but unremarkable","Passable apocalyptic folk ala Current 93, but it lacks the energy and sheer weirdness of David Tibet's work. I found most of the songs languid and boring, desparately in need of something to spice them up. This album was tolerable and well exectued, but there aren't any standout tracks, or anything terribly memorable. Overall, this is an unremarkable album that will fill some space in your CD rack until you decide to clean house and get rid of it."
3,Amazing rhythm section powers these guys!,"Portland, Oregon's Spurge have an amazing Bass player and drummer. They belt out some of their trademark punk-funk-ROCK tunes, slathered with guitar riffs that approach heavy metal quality. They explore some improvisational-jazz style breakdowns mid-song, interrupting the ROCK flow. The lyrics are pretty good, unlike the vocal quality. A transitional album?"
1,A real disappointment,"Presumably the author meant well when she wrote this book, but the tone throughout is condescending to people with ADD. Also, the information is frequently incomplete: the section on medication, for example, doesn't even mention the large percentage of ADD people who can't tolerate stimulant medications, much less discuss other options like biofeedback, nutritional supplements, and neuro-linguistic programming.There are plenty of other, better, books out there by people who know what it is like to have ADD and can get information across without the ""you-poor-thing"" attitude."
2,Disappointing,"This book seemed like a bunch of pamphlets strung together. Nadeau introduces a number of relevant topics, but they are all addressed superfically. While this book may have been an important contribution to education for ADD adults when it was written in 1996, more thorough and up-to-date introductory information is now available on the web. I think readers would be better served by other, more recent and more in-depth books."
5,A Must Read for Anyone in a Position of Decision Making,For true out-of-the-box thinking this is the book to read. It actually teaches the 'how' of creativity. You can learn to train your mind to be flexible enough to notice the often obscured perfect solution to any problem or situation.
3,Not aluminized pipe!,This is a good quality pipe for the price. The only problem I have is that it is not aluminized as advertised. Aluminized pipe does not rustsitting in the pipe rack!
1,Dose not work for most applications.,I recently bought this for my Onkyo home stereo system iPod dock so that I could plug in my iPod shuffle. It dose not work. From the research I have done this adapter will only work with iPod speaker systems. I just with I knew that before i bought it.
5,THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"I was kinda curious as to what this would do for my ipod shuffle and ended up finding out that this thing is just AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have the bose sounddock which unfortunately does not have an auxilary input, and i took a look at this and figured, heck, $13 (what i paid for it), it's worth a shot. I knew the shuffle has a proprietary jack, but the jack is only different on the third rung, and with the audio switch on, the third rung is disabled anywayz, which turns it into ur standard headphone jack. Be careful to NOT switch it to charging switch, who knows what it'll do. Anywayz, i took the extension cord that came with my bose quietcomfort 2 headphones, which were thankfully thin enough, and plugged it in. Electronics are idiots, all the sounddock knows is that there's an audio signal coming through and it plays it without complaining. This solution works great and is alot cheaper than any other method that i've seen."
1,Did not work...,"This product DIDNOT work at all with the ipod shuffles I have. There is a small ''tab''(not sure what to call it) that prohibits the shuffle from connecting all the way down. But even after taking a razor blade and cutting off the extra plastic that was in the way, the shuffle STILL wouldn't work with this! If I held the shuffle down snug with my finger I could get music to play, but as soon as I lifted my finger it would pop up and wouldn't play. So I guess I would say to make absolutely sure this will work with your EXACT ipod Shuffle 'Generation' before buying it."
1,Doesn't fit!,I saw a few other reviews that saying that this item didn't fit their docking station but ordered it anyway. Big mistake. Now I have to pay shipping to send it back! I had a standard clock radio docking station and it wasn't even close to fitting.
1,Melted,"I have the original Bose Sounddock (Firewire charge). For a few days, this product allowed me to wire my iPad to it and gave the Sounddock new life. Seemed to work well. Then, it simply melted. Kind of scary."
4,Works,"We bought this so my Daughter could hook her nano up to her ihome stereo. It took a while to get it to work - figured out you can't seat it all the way into the stereo, had to wiggle the nano, and then it started working. She is happy with it."
1,"Good product, lousy packaging","This is the official Apple product, as far as I can tell, but it was not in the original packaging. It said new in the listing, but since it was not in the original packaging, I can only assume it was used. The item shipped in two bubble envelopes, not very smart, the connector was sticking through the envelope. Stay away from this sellerr, they don't know what they are doing. The Apple product is working great."
1,Does not fit Bose SoundDock Series II,"The folks at Griffin need to either sell a dock that works for this specific Bose product or clearly explain on the web site exactly what systems this device does fit into. This product does not fit into the cradle. The plastic housing the connection is too large. The part worked fine, if you want to take the casing off the bottom... Not a good solution. Just a question, why does Bose hate the poor little iPod Shuffle so much that they exclude it from their sound systems? For the money you have to spend, they ought to include a decent dock convertor."
1,Griffin dock adapter for I Pod shuffle 2G (white),"Unfortunately I cannot give much of a review because the adapter did not work. It fit into my stereo but shuffle would not work. The prong for the shuffle to sit on doesn't seem to fit correctly, it seems to small. My son took a dremel to a plastic piece on the adaptor and ground at off and he got it to come on it we jiggled it a bit, but when you let go it would not play. I had to go out and buy an audio cable and will still have to charge my shuffle on my PC."
3,Griffin Dock Adaptor,"Unfortunately this product did not do what I thought it would, which was to allow me to use my ipod shuffle with a clock radio I have. It allowed me to play the ipod, but not use this feature. It's not an issue with the dock adaptor though, just the ipod. The product arrived on time and in good condition."
4,Allows for use of any 3.5mm input!!,"I bought this product because I was in need of new computer speakers and I had a Bose Sound Dock that was used twice a year. With this adapter and a 3.5 mm extension I now have a really good set of computer speakers.Con: Slight feedback noise. Only heard at higher volumes, so not a big deal at all.If you have Bose SoundDock 1st gen this will work."
3,Doesn't work with Alpine Car Stereo,"I have an Alpine car stereo that has the ability to control an IPod through the face. I have a regular IPod and a Shuffle. I was hopeing to use this little adapter so that I could plug my shuffle into my stereo, but no luck. It works like it's supposed to with other docking devices, just not in my car. :(."
3,Tried to use for non-shuffle,"I tried to use the adapter for a sansa clip after reading something online saying it could work. Well that person was wrong. I can't comment on how well it works for a shuffle, but definitely did not work for the clip. (if you were wondering, I have a ipod hook-up in my car but my ipod broke, so I was trying to get a converter to be able to use any mp3 player)."
4,Helps teach time,"My chap is a fan of Thomas, so this really help us teach him how to read the clock, which is pretty nice."
3,"Great clock, but content is dated","My 3yr old son is very interested in the clock but there's some slightly offensive text inside. A major character in the book is called ""the Fat Controller"". So yeah, I was surprised to see that on several pages. The book was published in Great Britain in 1992. ?"
2,The Gripper,"Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it."
2,runs to big,I have small hips and I went exactly by the products sizing and the shaper was too big... it doesn't do anything for me and I couldn't return it so be carful
3,Suck it in!,"I bought this thing to train myself to stand up straight and suck it in. Its true to size so make sure you order according to your exact measurements. I normally wear a small but I got the medium and glad I did. I would never have been able to get the small over my hips. It does suck it in and elimates the muffin top. However, it does poke the sides and roll down a bit in the back if you DON'T stand/sit up straight. Its very comfortable. I've been wearing it all throughout my workdays with no complaints, but towards the end of the day I can't wait to get it off. Pretty invisible under clothes. No one has noticed or at least they haven't said anything. No chaffing, rashes or sweating. Easy to pull on and off. In all, I would recommend this product."
3,Good control but...,"I was impressed with how the waistshaper was able to hold my tummy in. Unfortunately the diamond patterns showed through my wedding dress, so I returned it."
3,It rolls up at the bottom,"It holds nicely but it rolls up at the bottom almost instantly, nice shaping but hate the rolling up."
4,Excellent for Beginners,"As a professional trainer, my biggest concern is for begginers or sedentary people in search of a safe, appropriate way to get started with an effective program.For these people, there are alot of bad choices out there. But this DVD is perfect for beginners - safe, efficient and not overwhelming - A great way to build a fitness foundation.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitnesswww.AbsOfStoneCoreOfSteel.com"
1,Don't waste your money. There are better choices,"I was a big fan of the Mens Health Abs Diet series, so I bought the DVD. The information on the diet is the same as the books and magazine, there is no new information.The workout is awful, and totally unchallenging. Tom Holland is clearly targetting the workout to women. His comments of fitting into your miniskirt are unnecessary on a ""men's"" dvd. This just another women's workout that Men's Health is trying to position as a Men's Health product.If you wan t abetter workout, look for a used Men of Steel series tape. There si nothing better then ""Abs of Steel"" volume 1 and 3. Gilad's Abs workout is great.Again, avoid this product!!!!"
3,Okay for beginners,"The moves are easy to follow, and the host Tom Holland is very encouraging. That said, it's way too short and low-intensity for experienced exercisers! The ladies he has exercising behind him are obviously very buff, but he has them using 3 lb dumbbells and doing girl push-ups! What? Tuff girls are sure to feel a bit insulted by this, at least I did."
4,Great Diet!,"This product is slowly changing my life. I committed myself to follow the diet completely and after my first week I truly feel great. The plan is the best when it comes to great tasting food. Never have I enjoyed a plan as much as this one. The workout is relatively simple, straight forward and is complete. We just tried the intermediate section last night. I like it because you stretch in between excerises which means you don't become sore the next day. I was out of shape and not once have I been uncomfortable the next day. Go for it!"
2,The second dvd is much better!,"I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much. Boy, was I disappointed! The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit. The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form. Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2!"
3,Abs Diet Workout - Better for Beginners,"The workout is good for a beginner, and maybe and intermediate, but I was disappointed with the ""advanced"" workouts which are more warm-ups than workouts."
1,Money down the drain!,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this workout video. It was not at all what I expected it to be. I barely got a workout. Its slow and definitely not for those who crave intense workouts. I say its a waste of money unless you enjoy easy, slow workouts that you can't benefit from. It sat on my shelves for months until I finally gave it away."
5,Burton Highly Respected by Piazzolla as Musician,"Those who don't think vibes work with Tango written by Piazzolla are entitled to their own incorrect opinion, however, it must bestated that Piazzolla was a man interested in expanding the Tangoand incorporating jazz and other elements into it, and he workedwith Gary Burton, as well as many other jazz and classical performers and musicians to create a constantly growing Tango that would continue into the future. This album has many of theelements of the other albums Burton made with Piazzolla, a Tangothat added the new with the traditional. It is a gem."
2,Not for general audience,"For collectors or Anita Hegerland fans, a must buy item.If you are an entry level Mike Oldfield listener(first time shopper who is wondering which CD to buy as your first Mike's CD), avoid this. This 2 CD set can never be the ""Best"" or ""Greatest"" set - mere sampling platter created by AI or human being without respect for the music or art.""Picture in the dark"" and ""Innocent"" sung by Anita Hegerland are rare items for collectors.Disc 1 is collection of short songs for FM stations or driving, disc 2 is the evidence of the bad taste. I hate the way the publisher cut and shorten the original songs to pack up as many songs in a CD to make up CD set attractive. This will kill the music.Graphics and pictures are also rough and bad."
5,Excellent book,"I bought this book last year from Amazon, after being recommended it by a resource literacy teacher. It is very helpful to me, a classroom teacher. I would recommend it as great value for any teacher. I recently had the pleasure of hearing G Duffy speak at a day's conference here in New Zealand. He was so clear, so able to show the recent history of the teaching of reading, and how we might go about showing students the skills of comprehension, and what good readers do. In this book, G Duffy helps teachers model what good readers do. He is realistic and down to earth."
4,Review for literacy needs,This is a good supplemental text for a literacy coach or reading teacher to have on hand to explain breakdowns in students' reading.
1,There Are Better Books Out There,"As I understand it, this was one of the first low-carb baking books to come out.As such, I applaud its pioneer spirit, but I have to honestly say that there are better books out there now, and plenty of online resources where you'll find lots of better dessert recipes without going to the trouble of ordering and paying for this book.Almost without exception the cookie recipes call for shortening. If you don't use shortening for health reasons, you won't be baking any of the cookies in this book.Most of the recipes call for liquid Sweet n Low. Again, if you don't like the taste of sacharin, you probably won't be tempted to try these recipes.Clever cooks might be able to substitute powdered sucralose and some extra liquid for the liquid sacharin, but again, why spend extra time modifying existing recipes when you have so many other resources and can easily find recipes that don't call for things you don't want to eat?"
3,Baking Low Carb,"While there are some good recipes in this book, I find that too many are too many carbs and use ingredients that are not allowed on my low carb diet, Atkins. I also found some of the carb counts not accurate."
1,Not at all what I expected,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the one other reviewer here who is dissatisfied with this cookbook. After reading the excellent reviews on this board I decided to purchase this book, and I must say that I was quite disappointed. Simply put, the few recipes that I tried in this book were awful. I am very good cook and have no trouble making good recipes come out well, but these recipes simply were not good. The chocolate cake tasted nothing like cake. I'm not even sure how to describe it. The easy cheesecake was not what I'd consider a ""cheesecake"". It was more like slightly sweetened cream cheese whipped, spread in pie plate and chilled. I can in no way recommend this book to anyone who wants good food. Perhaps only to someone who wants low-carb desserts and doesn't care much about taste."
5,Fabulous!!!,"When I began my low-carb diet a few weeks ago, I thought I would have to give up desserts and a lot of the other foods I really like. After two weeks, meat & eggs were getting very old! Not only does Baking Low Carb provide variety, but the recipes are absolutely delicious!! Thank you Diana Lee for all the helpful suggestions and the time & effort you put into testing the recipes and putting this book together. I am one content dieter now!!!"
4,The Best Low Carb Baking Cookbook,"I have tried several of the recipes. I find that even for a novice baker such as myself these recipes are easy to follow and very tasty. I have even experimented with adding different low carb items to the bread and muffin recipes, such as adding a few low carb chocolate squares to the chocolate muffin recipe and adding cinnamon to the bread recipe."
2,Exchanging carbs for fat,"Like many low carb cookbooks, this one is heavy on whipping cream and cream cheese. I don't want to manage my pre-diabetes and get fat in the process! I had hoped for more recipes using healthy whole grain flours. Uses a lot of whey protein, which can be pricey."
2,"too repetitive, all upper body","The sets here are wonderful and the mood is engaging. The dancing, however, didn't work for me. Let me emphasize that I'm not an expert so this is purely an idiosyncratic, lay person review. But I found that the dancing was too repetitive and predominately arm-movement oriented. It just failed to hold my attention the way my other dance videos do. A friend who popped by and watched a bit of it, commented spontaneously about the same thing. Not bad, just not to my liking."
2,CD sounds terrible,"I picked up this CD fully aware that most of it wasn't going to be all that great. I just wanted a hard copy of her version of One Night in Bangkok to play on my fairly nice stereo, since I find MP3's generally don't sound as good.WHAT A MISTAKE. This 1996 'remaster' sounds horrible! The MP3 version of this song sounds much better. The whole CD is bass heavy, sounds slightly muffled, and distorts on the challenging sections. It sounds like a CD-R made from crappy low bit rate MP3's made in 1996, and that probably exactly what this is. I'm appalled at the sound quality on this disc.Don't waste your money on this. Try to find an original copy of the disc if you can.My question is, where does the better sounding MP3 come from??"
1,Yuck!,"The tracks on this CD contain simplistic melodies and minimal artistry. Robey carries the tunes, but without any apparent vocal training or richness in her ""style."""
4,G. I. Jukebox,"Collections dealing with World War II abound; this is a good introductory one. Nothing out of the ordinary here (although Rudy Vallee's ""As Time Goes By"" is an unexpected treat, along with the Merry Macs' ""Mairzy Doats""), but recommended for those who want a general overview."
4,WW2 Music,"Nice CD, with good music from World War II,audio quality, variety, and artists.They can think in a Vol II..."
1,Building Toothpick Bridges,I was disappointed by this book because it was not what I expected. It is structured as a classroom lesson plan for a team bridge building project for grade school children. The book does not provide much substance for real design and construction. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for instructions on how to actually build toothpick bridges.
1,Choking hazard,"I enjoy some of her earlier work but this one is misleading, in particular for those wishing to study (methods of) design research. Laurel neither relates nor contributes to the discipline of design research in this book in a direct way. Design postgraduates looking for a good book on design research are better advised looking at Design Research by Peter Downton, which is more difficult to get but worth it and newer."
3,A Little Bit Underwhelming,"I have to say, on the whole I was actually pretty disappointed in this book. It came off frustrating, I think, partly because there was no cohesive voice. Usually, one would say this is indicative of the design research community as a whole, but I found myself having a hard time switching from topic to topic so fast - the essays were pretty short, and as such, didn't contain a whole lot of information and/or depth to them. The most disappointing section, to me, was the first on ""People,"" because while this is one of the topics (ethnography and the study of people) that I'm most interested in, the essays only seemed to wade into the area knee-deep. That said, there were a few interesting gems in the ""Process"" section, especially Sean Donahue and Eric Zimmerman's essays. But in reality, I'd pass the book up for a book that more consistently and deeply approaches the topic of design research."
1,Design Research: Method and Perspectives,"Disappointing. Book is a mishmash of essays most of which are only minimally helpful to someone seeking a logical and organized presentation of information about design research methods. Many of the essays are rambling and self-congratulatory. The selection of an odd yellowish green make sections in which color was used difficult to read. Great topic for a book - but, unfortunately, this one is a waste of time and money."
5,great for those watching their weight/counting calories,"These bars are awesome. I had seen them in stores, but became hooked when a coworker told me she'd been eating them as meal-replacement bars and they helped her lose/maintain weight. Many days, I will have one as my lunch, and they really aren't bad! I must admit that I balked at the calorie count (about 200) when I first came across them, but if you have one as a meal, you're ok. They are full of vitamins and minerals, made with soy (good for you) and they have 80% of the DV of chromium, which is supposed to be good for helping shed those unwanted pounds (I believe it works!). My personal favorite flavors are strawberry yogurt, double chocolate and chocolate caramel cluster, but a lot of the other flavors are really good too. I buy these in bulk, they are so good! You have to try them!"
5,"""FRENCH DICTATION""","BRILLIANT!This is perhaps the best and most effective approach to our beloved Marquis! I expected something slightly different - a puppet version?? No, No, No! This is by far more sophisticated and effective. It's the Brechtian approach -humans behind the animal faces, in some cases, animal anatomy, it is alll quite SUCCESSFUL. This technique removes the viewer from the obvious, makes you look and digest.NOT FOR CHILDREN or the PRUDE, this refreshing, funny, moving and delightful work, it's champagne with sherbet. It's deSades adventures in the Bastille [that infamous prison] and his conversations with a specific and graphiclly ""portrayed with intelligence"" bodypart. DeSade is beautifully voiced by Francois Marthouret, and ""gestured"" by Philippe Bizot.[The other two movies, ""Quills"" and ""Marat/Sade"" are successful on their respective levels, but this one exposes more of the man some of us tend to be so curious about. This won't disappoint you!]"
4,Documentary style,When I bought this book I was hoping that it would be more about the author's experience with memory loss from ECT. The first chapter does give the author's experience which I enjoyed very much. The rest of the book is more of a documentary style where the author sits with an authority of some aspect of memory and gives a question and answer style information.
5,Sumptous and Splendid Performace,On original instruments. Recorded in 20bit this CD is of excellent quality. The piece combines theatre and music (early opera) of a high standard. Any fan of Monteverdi's Sacred vespers will love this.
1,Confusing title,"I want to warn you that although the title is ""Blue Base Badminton Net"" and it has a nice picture of blue base, it's just a net without any blue base. The refund policy is also kind of fishing. The charge 25% restocking fee plus you pay round trip shipping fee. I'll never buy anything from eSportsonline again."
2,"Looks good, not sturdy.","Within a day of putting it up, some of the netting has broken/snapped.It LOOKS good - you can slide a pole up into the yellow things on the side. You still have to find a way to tie it down - it's not easy to figure out on your own.But within a short time of being used, some of the netting snapped. Kind of a pain."
4,Perfect for our pool,This net is much easier to use than most other pool-specific nets and is much sturdier. Well made and very nice looking. The kids will have a tough time tearing this one up!
5,Seemless!,"Just finished ""To Reign in Hell"" and loved it. Seemlessly bridges the gap between ""Space Seed"" and ""The Wrath of Khan"" and I was thoroughly satisfied with the growth of the characters and the arc of the story.Derek Bullardauthor of MAYAN MOON and TWICE IN A BLUE MOONMayan Moon: The Jordon Journals: Book OneTwice in a Blue Moon: The Jordon Journals: Book Two"
3,A pretty good effort,"I'm not generally enough of a Trek fan to ruthlessly pursue all the novels in the series but I obtained this one because I enjoyed the authors other books on Khan. Mr Cox has previously done a good job in describing the often referenced Eugenics wars and you almost get the impression that such a war could have happened even though it didn't get into the history books.This book covers the period between Khan's abandonment on Ceti Alpha 5 and his rediscovery in Star Trek 2. It's not a bad read and does a pretty good job of portraying life in an extremely hostile environment. There are a few glaring errors, mostly involving the author's obviously imperfect knowledge of the metric system (I think sabre tooth tigers were longer than a metre). Also, the language is often a bit too flowery and melodramatic for my taste but this one should definitely satisfy the fans although I didn't like it as much as the previous Khan novels."
4,Good one,"Well,it was a good reading, a lot of passion, I love passion.It's a sad one, but we can realize that from the very first pages.Pages for You it's the kind of book that you find yourself thinking about it in your everyday life.I just think it could have been more dialogue between Flannery and Anne, but other than it's a great book."
5,Pages for Us,"In beautiful, short and evocative chapters, Brownrigg tells the story of Flannery, a first-year college student, who falls in love with Anne, a teaching assistant a decade her senior. The passion between these two women is honestly and powerfully drawn by the author. I was a little concerned about the age difference between the two as well as the fact that Anne could be abusing her power with an undergraduate. Once I got over these hurdles (and we shouldn't ignore them...what if Anne were a Walter?), I fell under the spell of their love and Flannery's not-so-surprising heartbreak. This is a well-crafted, haunting book that will conjur up vivid memories of one's first encounter with passionate love."
4,Good read for the open minded,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is a good book if you want to take a lazy day and get lost in your own little world. We know that the two main characters in this book are female lovers, but never is there a point where the run around screaming ""we're lesbians and proud!"" It is a well written book. It isn't written to help create tolerance, it is just a love story between two women who just happen to be women. I highly recommened this book to anyone (but it helps a lot more if you are open minded)."
3,Didn't live up to Potential,"Pages for you had potential to be a good book. It had a good plot, it had two intresting and developed leads, but it the book could have been so much more. The book also was set up in a funny way, which prevented the book from flowing in the way a novel should. It was an okay read, but if you can avoid spending $10+ on it, do so."
3,"Better than average, but not spectacular","This lesbian bildungsroman occasionally feels like the self-indulgent autiobiographical fantasy of first love it is. It's also occasionally fun, although a smart undergrad should find the depiction of lit crit university culture embarassingly naive and the protagonists unhelpfully flat. The prose is reasonably good, but often over-indulgent. My jaw dropped in disbelief when I saw that one of the blurbs compared the author to Jeanette WInterson. No comparison could be more off. (And that observation has nothing to do with indulgence, and everything to do with talent.) Nevertheless, it's steps above the average ""light lesbian romance,"" if that's the category you're browsing through. A reader less demanding than I may very well love its easy sentimentality. I read it on the plane, and it really helped the time pass."
2,It's oh-so-boring!,"I can't believe I am the only person who found this weird book boring. Each chapter is like two pages long, and basically, nothing happnes in this book. I mean, obviously some things are happening, but in a slow, un interesting way. The characters are flat, the pace is slow, and the plot is... well, boring."
4,Sweet story,This was a very enjoyable book. Once I started it I just couldn't put it down. A very sweet story about two women who fall in love.
2,A difficult read....,"I suppose the story is nice enough; but unless your name is Flannery or you're in love with someone of that name and like to read it over and over and over and over and over, you may find the author's use of it a bit tiresome. Six times in one paragraph in less than that many sentences? Surely there are many places where a pronoun would have fit much nicer, considering that you've already used the proper name so many times on that page already. I'd have to check out her next work in a bookstore where I could preview it before buying; I wouldn't have ever purchased this had I known what it was like to read. But then again, it was a penny book, so all I really paid for was shipping."
4,Steamy On-Campus Language & Love,"Anyone who's ever had a crush on a T.A., or fallen for an older woman for her beauty and her mind will find something to enjoy in Brownrigg's Pages For You. It's a lesbian love story, that like the best of Winterson, transcends the ""lesbian love story"" genre."
2,Mediocre at best,"I read some good reviews on here so I figured I'd give this book a read. It's an easy read, I zipped it through in 1 night. It jumps right in, the romance begins within the first few pages and 1/4 of the book is character development and development of the relationship. 1/2 of the book is just repetitive lust. It was exciting at first, but it became the same thing over and over for 100pgs or so. I began to get very bored with the exhaustive redundancy. The last bit of the book, well, I won't spoil it. It's not the best book I've read, it's not the worst either. If you're looking for erotica, it's in this book for sure, but honestly I just couldn't wait to be through with it and was disappointed by the ending. I was essentially dis appointed by the whole book. Give it a read though, it may be your cup of tea. I think it needs a lot of work to be a full, complete, enthralling, erotic piece."
2,Didn't last long,"We simply loved this toaster for 13months which is how long it lasted. It was the most used appliance in the house. Toaster, oven, warmer, etc but one day it just stopped working (right after warranty lapsed, coincidence?) Too bad because I thought it was actually a very well designed, simple to use toaster oven. I'm tempted to buy another one because I liked it so much...but I simply can't bear to spend that much money for something that won't last me long. I think I'm going with the t-fal this time."
2,I hated it so much I gave it away!!!!!,"I should have listened to the poeople that wrote reviews and said negative things about this item, but I bought it anyway. If I bought this locally, I would have returned it.1.I could not read the writing on the cheap plastic knobs.2.It was a decent oven, but a terrible toaster. Not only did it take forever, but would toast only side with the other side white, with one third burnt.3.The door did not open easily, you had to pull down hard, unsafe to do when the oven is hot.4.The oven was 50 degrees off.I did like the feature that the outside surface remained cool while in use."
5,The BEST toaster oven !,"The BEST toaster oven available ! A bit pricey but worth every penny! My laso DeLonghi lasted over twenty (20) years, the only reason to get a new one was to have an upgrade...my son is using the old one & it may just last forever!DeLonghi EO1238 1/2-Cubic-Foot 6-Slice Toaster Oven, Stainless Steel"
1,Horrible experience with this toaster oven,"It was impossible to actually toast anything without drying it out like a piece of jerky. Jerky toast - that's what I want in the morning! This was a problem from Day 1, but I thought that I'd solve it by turning the thing on for a few minutes before putting bread in for toast. Occasionally this was an acceptable strategy, but many times the oven would shut off the top element.I never could figure out how to get the heating elements hot and keep them that way. Additionally, I only once ever saw the bottom element get to a dull red hot, so I don't know if it ever was fully on. I don't know who the genius was at DeLonghi who designed this, but I'd like to tell them that YOU CANT TOAST BREAD ON LOW HEAT!!.Note: I purchased this toaster oven from a brick and mortar vendor, not Amazon. This was fortunate, since it simplified the return process."
3,Seven years...,"We've had ours for seven years and it's going strong. Only faults have been that he Teflon coating is going on the broiler pan, and I just had to replace the thermal fuse."
4,DeLonghi 1238 toaster oven,"Do not give 5 stars unless the item can read my mind, but have had this oven for about a month and if you remember the old adage, ""when all else fails read the directions"" it works great. Does good toast,toasted waffles, and broils burgers and hot dogs just like you want them. Even with the kitchen range you have to pay attention and this oven does the trick with light cooking chores. Would buy this manfacturers products again.Jim Martin"
4,Great toaster overn,"Excellent product. Toasts great and is excellent for small baking and grilling items. Reheats pizza and breads perfectly. Numbers on the dial are a bit hard to read - but not tremendously difficult. I do see that in the later model of the over they put the numbers around the outside of the dial.Slide out ""drawer"" in the front makes it a breeze to clean up."
2,I don't own it but....,"I went to Macy's and saw it on sale for $69(or $79? I forgot). After comparing it with Cuisinart TOB-50 which is also on sale but for $99, I chose Cuisinart. Plus open a Macy's card and pre-sale that earns me 20 dollars back, I only paid less than $70.Back to this machine. Its design is so attractive, the best parts are: its crumb plate pull-out is in the front--Cuisinart is on the back, and it's round inside so it can fit in a 12"" pizza.HOWEVER, the knobs are hard to read and very cheap made. The knobs in display are already loose. The knobs also looked like they are not in the exact places they should be. They are not in the center of the ""knob place"", a circle a little lower than panel.All in all, I don't feel like it's a high quality oven. There is no warranty info on box, either.Just my in-store observation for anyone who consider buying this."
1,$100 Toaster,"This product is a toaster. Nothing else.The timer control has 3 settings (for toast only), LIGHT-MEDIUM_DARK.In trying to cook a 6in. frozen pizza, it took 4 turns of the dial (to DARK) to produce an undercooked, soogy crusted pizza.This is a real POS. Dials are hard to read, does not cook ANYTHING well but toast.There are better choices, for less $. Stay away from this one."
1,I tried to like it,I bought the Delonghi 4 Slice Retro toaster and wanted the matching toaster oven. Wow was I disappointed. I tried to like it but it just doesn't get hot. Also the timer ticks through the whole process. Unfortuntely I had to return the toaster oven to Amazon and recieved a full refund. Thanks Amazon!
3,A Very Poor Purchase,"If you buy this DeLonghi toaster oven be sure you also buy the one-year ($9.95) replacement coverage. Our oven worked for four months, then completely shut down. It cost $15.00 to ship the defective oven to a repair shop that was willing to fix it under the warranty. We haven't gotten the oven back yet--after FIVE MONTHS. They keep telling us they are waiting on parts from the DeLonghi plant in Italy. How can Amazon justify selling this product?"
1,"Loved it, then hated it.","We loved this toaster, didn't mind the knobs. Size was very spacious. It completely broke down at 13 months and we had to buy a new toaster. We're not going with the same manufacturer this time."
4,"Works fairly well, knobs ARE hard to read, broke once","It's pretty, it does most things you want a toaster oven to do.Gripes:1) Knobs are hard to read.2) Mine broke after a couple of years. Thermal fuse inside burned out. Repaired it myself for $5...but this would be game-over for most people.3) Teflon on cooking tray started bubbling/peeling off.4) To call this 'stainless steel' is sort of like cars with 'leather seating surfaces'....the top is SS, the handle and lower front is SS. The sides are silver plastic and the tray and rear are aluminum.The good parts:It tends to work well and you can see what is going on with the light and big glass door.It looks fairly cool and upscale.It's easy to clean.Would I buy another one? Yes."
3,DeLonghi toaster oven review,"The pros of this oven is that it is user friendly. The door opens forward and the tray is easily removable for cleaning. Once heated, this products works well.The con of this oven is that it takes way too long to heat the element and therefore toast or bake an item."
1,Don't buy this one!!!!!!,"Door advance feature broke after several weeks. Lower heating element broke after six months. Customer service refused to stand behind the product, stating that the warranty was expired. Note to buyer- warranty is one year from time of manufacture- NOT the date you actually receive it as a gift or purchase it. The knobs on the unit are like a child's toy- cheap and plastic. This is a highly disappointing product- I doubt we will buy another Delonghi product again."
1,Not worth the high price tag,"I returned this item. Only toasted one side of the bread. Stainless Steel - only the top, sides are plastic. When I read that the knobs were hard to read, I took these comments with a ""grain of salt"". Those consumers were not kidding...and I don't wear or need reading glasses! Can't imagine anyone would actually pay over $200 for this item (suggested retail). I guess this consumer is really trying to keep up with the ""Jones's"". It's really the name you would be paying for - surely not a quality item from DeLonghi."
2,Poor Product!,Bought this in February of 2007. It Stopped working in March of 2008.Cost is too high for such a poor product. I wouldn't buy another one.
2,Just like everyone else...,"We decided to pay a little extra for this toaster becaues it almost perfectly matched the rest of our appliances. And we figured that at this price it would stand the test of time. It did. For exactly 23 months. Today it died. I don't expect things to last forever, but replacing a toaster after two years is just stupid. I mean, it's a wire, heating elements, and a timer. :-("
1,Disappointed in this product,This is the third delonghi toaster oven I have owned and by far the worst. The first two were great and just wore out after years of use. Given this track record we went for a third and right away saw some problems. It takes longer to toast then the earlier versions and after only 8 months of use it stopped heating up at all. Think twice before buying one of these.
1,disappointed,Unpacked the toaster. Plugged it in. Didn't work. Had to repack and lug it to the post office for return. UGH!
4,Great addition to the kitchen,"I bought this toaster oven at the end of June and I really like it. It makes much better toast than a conventional toaster, so bread comes out perfectly crisp. We've used it to reheat frozen pizza (yes, it does fit a 12-inch), roast corn and peppers, bake fish, melt cheese, slow bake, broil and more. The pull-out tray at the bottom is very easy to clean (no more crumbs collecting like our old toaster). I agree that the dials are slightly hard to read, but it's really no big deal. Overall it's a great product, well designed and worth the price. Plus, as I write it's almost 100 degrees outside -- and the toaster oven does not heat up the kitchen at all!"
1,5 Reasons NOT to buy this product,"5 good reasons not to buy this over.1. The knobs fall off. All three fell off within the first 6 months of buying and wouldn't stay on, even with glue.2. It takes forever to toast.3. To go from ""bake"" to ""toast"" mode, you have to adjust two different knobs, and one is easy to forget causing only one side of the bread to toast.... probably why there is another reviewer saying it only toasts on one side.4. The silver on the sides is not Stainless Steel, it is PAINT on plastic, and it bubbles and peels off after some time, about 1 year.5. Finally, after exactly 2 years, the oven just stopped working... totally.If you want an oven that stays together and works and that lasts more than 2 years, do not buy this one!"
2,Stopped Working after a Year,"Seems like other people have had the same experience...for no reason the whole thing died shortly after a year. For the price, this is unacceptable!"
2,"Purchased June 2005, RIP Sept 2007","I must start by saying that our prior Black & Decker toaster ovens lasted more than 5 years, and were still working well when we bought new ones. By the time we got rid of them, they were very unattractive, but we would clean them up and donate them to charity. One of our Black & Deckers might have actually died on us, but we never felt we got a bad deal.We paid about 100$ for the Delonghi, and for that price I do not feel we received good value at 27 months of service. Our expectations are more along the lines of 60 months of service, for less than 100$. As with another recent review, our unit just stopped working spontaneously.The Delonghi is stylish, which does not really matter much to me. It has an excellent removable tray which cleans easily. While it worked, it worked well. If it had lasted even 48 months, I would have been basically satisfied. 60 months and I would have been completely satisfied. 27 months is inadequate."
2,Not Great,It takes extremely long to toast things. It is also unnecessarily large. I would suggest buying a different one if I had to do it all over again.ReL
2,"okay for the money, but...","You have to pay close attention to the dials (a magnifying glass would help) because you have to have all 3 lined up correctly in order to toast something. With most of these things, you kind of get the hang of the ritual after a week or so, but this thing is a little counter-intuitive, so it takes a while longer."
2,I expected much more,"It explain well the relationship between price and volume, but I expected more discussion on the technical indicators like stochastics, MACD, Williams %R,RSI, OBV ect... It doesn't cover well time frame that has to be used when reading technical indicators. And it doesn't show you how to combine the diferents indicators."
4,Good resource,This book was required for my class and has been a great research in developing my research topic. The condition was as stated in the description and is not excellent. Quickly delivered and in time for use in my class.
2,Expected more.,Really like the feeling of tea tree oil etc on the scalp with the tingling/ refreshing feeling it imparts. This product does not deliver.
3,good organic,"This was my first try at organic conditioners and it works but you do need to use a little more of it in order to get the job done. i started using a leave in detangle spray so that helps. also, organics should help the environment, plastic containers (especially when theres so many alternatives) work against that. so 3 stars, -1 for having to use more, -1 for the plastic."
1,Does Not Condition,"Over the years I am a hair product junkee looking for something that really works. My hair is dry and bleached out so I thought I would try this product but it does not work on my hair at all. I can't even finish the product, I am throwing it out. It does not condition my hair like I thought it would from reading the reviews. I was hoping it would work better because I want to use more natural products but without the conditioning, I was pulling hair out when I combed it after I washed and conditioned it. I tried Avalon shampoo too and am not impressed."
2,No difference,Saw absolutely no difference using this product. Found out hair loss was due to iron deficency and not any topical issue.
5,my review,"I havent really used it long enough to see a difference, but it is nice. It is the biotin shampoo and conditioner."
2,Did not make my hair feel soft!,After using the conditioner it did not make my hair feel soft. It felt dry and damaged and was not easy to comb.
1,Don't believe everything you read,"Based on the reviews I read prior to my purchase, I expected my hair to feel fuller and thicker. It did not...My hair felt stiff and brittle. I tried it a second time and this time I could see my hair breaking off in my hand...the smell was great and that is about all. I am so disappointed in the purchase, price and end result of the product that I could shoot myself for such a waste....Don't count on it working for you. :(while the conditioner is thick, it does not offer a silky feeling to your hair. I found my hair hard to untangle and I spent a great deal of time delicately untangling my fine long hair to prevent further damage.I have gotten better results from generic conditioners like Suave than I could ever get from this product.What an incredible waste of money."
2,Dries out my hair,"Product dried out my hair. I was disappointed since this is organic. I expected it to be better. But, Pantene works better than this and does not dry my hair out. Smell was ok. It was not overwhelming, but it did not smell great either. It did make my hair look thicker, but dried out."
3,Not as good...,"I definitely didn't like this conditioner as much as other Avalon Organics conditioners I've tried. Maybe its the 'clarifying' quality to it, but my hair seemed more stripped, much more difficult to comb through than with their other products. The lemon smell is perfect, refreshing, natural lemon smell. My hair is thick, wavy, slightly dry, so it may work better for someone with more fine, oily hair."
1,no good,"This product did nothing for my hair, I have a hair loss problem and it didnt even help a slight bit. after using it made my hair dry and brittle, no moisture whatso ever."
5,thicker hair,I love this product. It really works. I use it with the shampoo. My hair is growing and it looks healthier and thicker. And it sheds a lot less. If you want a full head of hair I recommend this product.
5,best conditioner!,"I have used MANY conditioners and this one is my favorite. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. I found the previous review puzzling because I have dry hair and this does not dry it out-quite the opposite. Also, it has NO fragrance, another reason I like it. Used with the shampoo, I get the best results I have had from any hair product. I recommend it!!"
5,great conditioner,"I have only used this product for about a month, but I Love this conditioner. hair feels stronger and more manageable. Would recommend."
5,Best Conditioner for Fine Hair!,"This is the first conditioner I've ever used that did not weigh my hair down! I recommend this conditioner (and the Avalon Thickening Shampoo) to anyone with fine hair. I have alot of hair, but it's fine. I did not use conditioner for years because of the ""weighed down"" factor and decided to try Avalon Thickening Conditioner because my hair started to feel very dry. I like the Avalon Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner better than anything I've purchased at a salon! The only thing I'm afraid of is that whenever I find a product I like, it ends up being discontinued - hope this never happens with Avalon products!"
2,Didn't care for it,"The conditioner was the better of the two, but I didn't care for this product. The scent doesn't quite mix right to make a pleasant scent. It's ok, I just think there are better products out there. My hair is mid length, natural curly and thick. I didn't think there was any advantage to my hair type as far as moisture or frizz free benefits go."
2,"Didn't ""condition"" very well","For conditioner, this did not do its main job very well: conditioning. It probably did (used in conjunction with the matching shampoo) do a fairly good job of making my hair feel thicker, but it just didn't condition my hair much. Not impressed."
2,I get itch,"Something about this shampoo that although it smells good and refreshing, it makes my scalp itch. Could be just me. Wouldn't buy again."
2,Didn't see results,I washed and conditioned 1 a week but didn't see much difference. No thickening. May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair.
2,Unnecessary.,"I bought the shampoo and figured I had to get the conditioner to go along with it. Nope. It barely did anything for my hair. It was like adding water to my hair. I even tried to mix it with another conditioner. Big mistake on that one. My hair felt like it wasn't clean. Anyway, I would skip this."
3,Ehh...,This stuff is ok but it didn't work any miracles. I probably wouldn't order it again. It's not silky feeling like normal conditioner.
2,DRIED MY HAIR,"I BOUGHT THIS Avalon Organics: Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner, 14 oz AND THE SHAMPOO AND USED IT DURING THE WHOLE 2012 AND NOT ONLY DID NOT THICKENED MY HAIR BUT IT MADE IT VERY DRIED."
3,Good job at looking thicker,"This shampoo has some pro's: Hair feels thicker, looks thicker, more volume.and some con's: Need to use a whole lot of it because it barely ""suds."" After rinsing it out, my hair looks and feels extremely dry and brittle (wet and dry). But, it is a thickening shampoo, and I guess if it makes my hair look thicker, it does what it says."
2,Very drying to the hair.,"I just finished my first bottle of this product. I am in my early 50s, my hair tends to be oily and I have an unacceptable amount of shedding which is the reason I chose this formula. The smell is great but the conditioner doesn't moisturize very well even if you leave it on for 4-5 minutes. I eventually bought Aussie 3-minute Miracle to put on the ends and that did help me get through the bottle. I am reordering the matching shampoo but will look for something else for conditioning. I just wish there were a conditioner that had both Biotin and Saw Palmetto."
3,Adds some volume but...,"This shampoo does seem to add some volume to my hair, unfortunately, it's been really frustrating to use. It leaves my hair extremely tangled. Even when I put copious amounts of conditioner after this shampoo, I still have a really hard time brushing my hair. I've never really had this problem with any other organic or conventional hair product."
3,Smells good. Feels Tingly... Dries my hair,"This product is good for those that have a greasy scalp. It didnt fit me right. The smell is great and herbal. And your scalp feels pretty good, But beware it might dry your hair out."
2,Biotin Thickening Conditioner,"Following my review on the Biotin Thickening Shampoo - I do not care for this product at all. The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4"" away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I'm unsure if that's due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair."
1,super watered down,This conditioner not only seems watered down but it really doesnt do much for my hair either. I have to use a trememdously large amount in order to get any type of actual conditioning feeling in my hair with this...literally 1/4-1/3 of a cup worth. This wouldnt be SO bad if i didnt have super fine and thin hair to begin with and its short so there should be no reason i should have to use this much conditioner. I have used many different organic types of shampoo/conditioner and never have had to use this much. I was really excited to get this conditioner but honestly it is not at all worth the money paid for it. Very dissappointed
3,"Noticed no results, smell is not so good",This is thick and kind of difficult to spread throughout hair and doesn't smell that great. I've also not noticed any benefits one way or another. I'll not be buying this again.
3,It's Different,"I liked this conditioner, I just didn't love it. The texture is very different from any other conditioner that I have used. It did make my hair shiny and it did smell good, but I am just not sure it's for me. If you have dry hair, I wouldn't recommend this. It's a very lightweight conditioner that would benefit someone with oily hair. As a matter of fact, I actually ended up giving this to my teenage daughter, who does in fact have oily hair, and it seems to work just fine for her."
4,good,This is a good conditioner that is healthy for my head. I use it in conjunction with my Groganic's shampoo and alternate both of them. It is not heavy and it cleans my hair well without drying it out.
5,Kodocha Babbit hat!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG... I love this hat. I'm wearing right now, as I type this review.It's soft and adorable! The ears are standing up, they don't flop around or fall down. They are permanently up there. This hat is so awesome, I don't want to ever take it off. It's embroidered, so the eyes and mouth and sweet, little, pink heart on the left temple, are forever. Because it's made of fleece, it's warm as well. And the wings on the back are awesome... I can't say enough about it, it's my favorite hat ever."
4,Fun Art Activity,"I had a great time painting and coming up with creative designs with my neice. I wish the bowls were bigger, but overall it's a great product. And most importantly my five year old neice had a BLAST!"
2,could have been good,"We received the bowls...well actually the first order came with chipped bowls (which Amazon took back with no problem) and then the second pair came. The bowls were fine, but out of the 5 paint colors, only 2 were liquid. The other 3 were dried out. Since we needed these for a gift, I couldn't return it again, so we painted with yellow and red. It would have been nice to have all 5 colors. I am very disappointed. OH well, guess we'll plan better and go to a pottery place next time."
2,Very Out Dated,No SLI a 256 Vid card in a Ultimate Gaming Machine ? If you are a 1st time builder this book might help with explanations of what does what and how it does it. But if you are looking to build a Gaming PC thats dx 10 ready to play games such as COD 4 and Crysis go with a recent Maximumpc release.
4,Worth the Money,"I used this book as a guide to build my gaming computer. With the technology changing and new items coming out so fast, it's impossible for any book to be current for more than a few months. So use this book only as a guide and search for the most up to date info you'll need to build your computer."
5,"Tekiela's ""Birds of California"" very useful.",I purchased the book to help me identify birds that visit my bird feeders and have found it very useful. Have identified all of the 8 species of bird visitors. Recommend the book for individuals like me who want to identify birds they see. Bird watchers may also find it useful.
5,Terrific guide - makes identification quick and easy,"I've had this book for several years and I love it.I know a couple of reviewers here have panned the book's organization, but for amateur birdwatchers it provides the easiest method I can think of for identifying birds quickly.The book is organized in color sections, with convenient visible color-coded page markings that make it easy to get to the color grouping you want without having to go to the index or table of contents. So, if you see a mostly yellow bird, you just go to the yellow section. Within the sections the birds are organized from smallest to largest, so it's pretty simple to get to the right section fast.I'm going to be moving to another state soon and was pleased to discover that these same guides exist for other states as well. I definitely plann on buying the one for the area I'm moving to."
5,Quick and Easy Reference Book,"I am merely a casual bird observer with my young boys, but compared to other bird identification books I've owned and looked at, this is by far the most user-friendly for those of any age with no 'birding' backround. The ability to look for the birds by color is just the easiest way to look them up. The ability to view a photo of every bird, both male and female, makes this book outstanding! It also shows where on a California map they can be found during various seasons of the year, nesting, egg identification info., food sources and misc. info. on each birds' habits make it an excellent resource and my kids LOVE using it too. It is also small enough (4""x6"") to fit in a jacket pocket when hiking. I think every parent of young children should own at least one."
4,Fun Puzzle!,"This is a great puzzle for children that still need a little help knowing where the pieces go. It has the picture underneath the pieces, so the child can just match the piece with the picture. It also has the added bonus of making a firetruck siren sound when the puzzle is complete...rewarding the child for completing it. My 3 yr old loves it!"
5,great product,"This by far is the best puzzle I have every gotten. The crisp picture of the fire truck is outstanding, and the sound quality is great once the puzzle is put together. It is a great learning tool for kids to put the puzzle together and once it is put together the sound comes on letting the kids/child know it was put together correctly."
4,Comical,"I purchased this book to give to a friend who was retiring at 70. I am glad that I ""went through"" it before wrapping it. It is a comical book, but does not work for a lady who is not married, has never been married, and has no grandchildren, otherwise a cute gift. Now, I have it in my ""gift giving"" pile and will wait to find the right person to give it to. In the meantime, I need to find another ""funny""for the retiring lady."
3,The Bookschlepper doesn't recommend,"Another in the series of whimsical poetry books on aging. The problem with these poems, beyond their obviousness, is Viorst's reluctance to grow old. For those of us who flaunt every wrinkle and gray hair we've earned, some of this seems shallow. Dieting at 70? Gimme a break!"
4,I'm too young to be 70...,"Great book for those of us who are about to hit this big number! She is a great author. The best part, is that she is a bit older than I so I can relate to her books!"
1,Bordeebook did not deliver the product I expected,"The Amazon listing for the Bordeebook vendor that supplied the book I bought, I'm Too Young to Be Seventy, did not live up to its claim. This was supposed to be a used book in good condition. The book I received is warped diagonally from corner to corner. There was a birthday card glued inside the front cover as well as a personal inscription on the facing page. I purchased this book as a gift and was very disappointed about the condition of the book. Third party vendors need to categorize their books to a set of common rules."
2,I'm Too Young to be Seventy,"Not much humor and not fun to read. A disappointment. I had purchased an extra copy for a friend that is facing a huge fight with cancer and thought it would brighten her time and outlook.....needless to say, I did not give it to her."
4,A Great Gift for The Big One,"I turned 70 this month, as did many of my friends. I bought several copies of this book to send as gifts along with birthday cards. I've gotten delighted comments back. I also enjoyed reading it myself. It's the kind of gift that can keep being played forward."
4,useful source,5th grade daughter needed this book for her social studies essay on the Gettsyburg Address. Proved to be an informative source for her project
5,Challenging yet comforting read,"This was a fabulous book. The author takes a realistic, relatable stance on the effects of casual sex or casual intimacy on the heart, mind and soul of a woman, outside the safe parameters of marriage. Although she writes from the Christian prespective, the points and message of this book can be relatable to anyone, especially those broken by yet another failed relationship and who suffer a broken heart. It reads as if you are having a ""heart to heart"" with a friend with whom you feel completely safe and whose honesty comes from love, not condemnation. the best part: she offers solutions. You just have to be brave enough to take her input to heart and act on it."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK-A MUST READ FOR ALL WOMEN,"I loved this book. It said exactly what I have been feeling for years, but wasn't quite sure how to put into words. It really helped me get through the junk I had been dealing with from past relationships and the struggles I was having because of that. I would recommend this book to any woman looking for advice on how to regain her femininity without losing her sexuality. A great resource and a must have for any bookshelf."
1,ME ESTAFARON CON EL PRODUCTO QUE ME ENVIARON,"I BUY THIS PERFUME 100 ML OF MY HOUSE AND I GET ME ONE OF 7 ML. MEETING THAT CHEATED ME AND I SHOULD SEND THE FRAGRANCE OF 100 ML 4 MY HOUSE WITHOUT CHARGE CHILE AGAIN .. I DEMAND A SOLUTION, BEFORE TAKING ACTION LEGALES.CHAO"
1,Beware,"After reading the reviews I expected somwhat of an oriental fragrance. Instead, I received a fragrance that smelled like after shave. This one is not the least bit womanly. Beware - if you want to smell like a man, buy it, if not, make another choice."
5,MAJOR OBSESSION,"This is 1 of the HOTTEST scents out there. I am so glad that Calvin Klein made another version of Obsession that younger women such as myself can appreciate. This is the Toilette version which isn't as ""stick w/you"" as the Parfum version does. Thank goodness they make the parfum now. This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have purchased in the past 3 months. Get it, you won't go wrong."
1,it's not the same parfum,"It is same packing and the same bottle, but the perfume is imitation. It does not have the same color, it is yellow instead of transparency, and it does not have the same aroma. That cost me very expensive for imitation. 65$ with the shipping, and I can't use it. Excuse my English i'm french."
2,sharon g,"Had to try Night Obsession since I really love the fragrance of Sheer Obsession. It is ok but can't beat the Sheer's light fragrant smell. The top cap of the Night Obsession had a sticky substance covered all over it and took about 15 minutes to clean if off with Goo Gone product. The box it was in did not have the sticky glue on it. Strange the cap was just sticky, like someone put it in the box dried before boxing it. Was very disappointed with this surprise situation when lifting it out of the box. Hope it doesn't happen to anyone else."
1,Website deception,"After searching for Obsession Night, the first link was for perfume, the picture showed perfume, and the company sent body lotion. The perfume is great, and the price was great, if only they had sent the product advertised."
5,Favorite Scent,"Something I wear everyday, it is my favorite CK scent. Not too flowery, sweet, or overpowering. Produces a soft clean smell."
5,Lembas. Mmmm.,"While the other flavors of this line are also good, this is my fave, and I keep them cached in a drawer at work, in my glove compartment, in my backpack.For those in the know, this is as close as I've found to lembas outside a mallorn leaf. Some people find these ""how can you eat that"" inedible, probably because they are evil creatures.Unless you you like messy, the lack of a chocolate coating is a boon in the heat."
3,Product received is not what I ordered,"Ordered this inexpensive filter kit to play with before investing in some better ones. The box that I received was labeled ""Crystal Optics Limited Edition Digital camera/video 3-piece filter kit"" This is totally different from the product listed on Amazon.Upon opening the package, the filters don't look anything like what is pictured. They are actually black (not silver as in the product pictures) The seller needs to correct this so that buyers know what they are getting. They are un-coated despite the fact that it says ""multi coated"" on the box. The CPL and UV filters are glass, while the fluorescent daylight filter is plastic garbage. Build quality is so-so, I really just wanted the CPL to play with and it does a decent job, not as much polarization as other more expensive ones but it was cheap so no complaints. Just annoyed that the product I ordered was not what I actually got and it's not worth my time to send them back."
5,Must read for educators who help build intellectual capital.,"Intellectual Capital : The New Wealth of Organizations by Thomas A. Stewart, is a must read for educators. The education domain has dramatically underestimated its value and contribution to the development and deployment of intellectual capital. It is time educators reassessed and this is the book to start with."
4,Good introduction to terms and issues marred by...,"...few references to groundbreaking authors, such as Leif Edvinsson. Nonetheless, as a practitioner in the field, I found this work a useful way to introduce others with little time and less patience to evaluating ambiguous situations with more confidence. The book is a very good resource for introducing basic material and ""case-in-point"" examples from major businesses. More importantly, it's an easy plane read for those, like myself, who are racking up too many Frequent Flyer miles and need useful brain candy. After this book I was well-prepared to understand presentations and demos from the Knowledge Management conference last September in L.A."
1,Stewart treats us all like children,"I started reading this book with the best intentions. However, when Stewart begins with such kindergarten level assertations, I knew as a Business student, there was no point in continuing reading this book. Stewart, a Fortune Editor, has no business training: he is a Harvard English major, and this is clearly shown in his work. If one reads his fortune articles, they are equally poorly written with bad information. I would suggest that one spend their money on better Management authors such as Jon Katzenbach or Peter Drucker, both of whom actually have a clue."
4,Could use a little more power,"Built a stereo with this and the four channel version with two p5's and was pretty pleased. Not as loud as I had hoped but worked well for rock music and the like. My favorite parts were it's size and it's low amperage use, I had an alternator problem on my Focus from my last amp."
5,Tales From Earthsea is a wonderful anthology that answers some of the questions hinted at in the previous books.,"Le Guin's fast, lyrical prose is a joy to read and these five stories stand as sterling examples of her work. I loved everything about this work, especially the surprising facts that women and men founded Roke and that a single biased archmage created the myth that women could not be mages. The appendix at the end of the book sums up nicely all the varied tales and legends in Earthsea that were only mentioned in passing before. I was very glad about this because I always wondered what really happened between Morred and Elfarren. All in all a magnificent work. Also, if you missed Tino Georgiou's masterful novel--The Fates, go and read this popular best-seller."
4,Good But Not Outstanding,"This is a collection of stories and some supporting material about Earthsea, the fictional world developed by Le Guin in a series of previous novels. The Earthsea novels are first rate fantasy, on a par with Tolkien and Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy. The present book is not as good. While the quality of writing is solid, it doesn't approach Le Guin's best work. This book is still attractive by providing interesting information about Earthsea and the stories are entertaining. Le Guin is publishing another Earthsea novel this year and the last story in this book is an apparent bridge to the forthcoming novel."
3,"aka ""Feminist Tales From Earthsea""","Interesting addendum to the Earthsea saga, continuing a change to the feel of the stories that LeGuin started with Tehanu. Learn more about why men are evil, women are good, and dragons will fix everything. It does fill in some of the history of Earthsea, which is interesting, but she doesn't focus on some of the big names you would expect to hear more about--rather she invents new small characters to fill some of the historical void. Worth reading, but [$$$]is a little too much for this unless you really feel the need to add it to your Earthsea collection. Borrow it from the library..."
2,I can't help feeling Le Guin dislikes the original trillogy,"I could not bring myself to give this book less than 2 stars because Le Guin's writing is as captivating as always. I got absorbed into every story, although I found them to end abruptly - point made; the end. The overall tone of the book seems to be the unmaking, or ""unmasking"" of the Earthsea of the trilogy. It seems that Roke was founded by women who were supplanted by fanatical, misogynistic men. Ogion, Ged's master's role in stopping the earthquake is greatly over stated. Credit really belongs to a woman teaching magic forbidden by the men on Roke.The Master Summoner, saved by Ged in The Farthest Shore, takes up the Pelnish Lore - used by the enemy in The Farthest Shore for the purpose of keeping women out of the School of Roke. There is clearly room to improve the role of women in the world of the Earthsea Trilogy, but that is no reason to destroy that world."
3,Tales from Earthsea are not children's Tales!,"My children are 10 and 12 - just old enough to have enjoyed the original trilogy. Unfortunately, too little happens in these stories to hold their interest.I enjoyed the original trilogy and I enjoyed Tales from Earthsea even if my children did not. Tehanu I found preachy, a fault that Ms. LeGuin allowed herself to fall into at times during Tales from Earthsea. It seems to me that Ms. LeGuin has been writing apologia for making her original trilogy so male-centered. I would have preferred if she had simply made the original trilogy less male-centered, since Ged's story would not have been affected (or perhaps it would have been deepened with the added complexity of strong female characters), than try balance the trilogy with female-centered stories in which she tries to make a point rather than allow herself to weave a magical tale."
4,Not your standard fare,"I heard bits of this album on NPR one afternoon so I ordered it. The first track, ""The Compledgegationist"" is incredible and quite evoking (and best listened to loud). It is followed by a gaelic rap song, ""Tine Lasta"" which is original and a pleasure to listen to, even if you don't understand the words.After the first two tracks, the album loses a little pace. The rest of the tracks are okay, but not up to the quality of the first two. It's a pity because when you first put the CD in to play, you are blown away and lead to believe you're found something new and unique.So, I simply keep replaying tracks 1 and 2."
5,EAR CANDY,"This is an excellent cd, pure unadulterated joy to listen to. Each track has its own unique personality which reveals an incredible complexity of sound and texture..it would be difficult to top their last cd but the more I listen the more I think they did it."
1,no working just after the warranty expired.,"I am an unlucky guy, the laptop startup as blank screen just after the warranty expired. it requires to replace the system board as $900. if you like this laptop, please buy as least 3 years extended servcies with 100% hardware replacement."
4,9300 Nokia,"Awesome Product, i am fully satisfied with that nokia produce, i a, long time nokia product user, all though nokia realease this product much earlier but still it is worth."
2,Unstable,"I have owned the phone for about 6 months now. I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and recieve about 20 emails a day. The phone has a bunch of great capabilities and is ocassionaly a great work companion. The wide screen is excellent for viewing. The cpu functions work a little slow which could be expected from such a small package. The frustrating part is the phone frequently works slow as well. When it does calls are lost. About once a week it is necessary to take out the battery and let it sit for a minute before turning the phone on. The phone takes a couple minutes to turn on. Overall, it seems slow and unstable which overshadows all of its great features. Reminds me of Windows 98."
2,Nokia 3300i - where is the predictive text?,"This review is for a 9300i - the latest model - not listed. I bought this - very expensive- phone in the middle east, configured it to English UK and when I come to use predictive tect find that I get Arabic popping up. The handbook clearly states there is a Dictionary in Options when writing Text. There isnt. Nor can I access predictive text by pressing the suggested key twice - as in other Nokia models. My service agents have variously told me - 'It's ok - just use the computer keyboard'. - 'It's not available on this phone' 'Yes this phone has predictive text'.- It has been to the main service agent here in Dubai only to be returned in an altered state - but no predictive text. I cannot contact a sensible person face to face to get the help I need. NOKIA - get this sorted! How many people come to Dubai and buy these treats only to get them home and find they have spent a lot of money and not got the bargain they had hoped for."
2,Damn Lousy Tribute,"All the female vocalists on here sound the same, what's up with that? With the exception of a cool reading of ""... Factory"" by the amazing Swarf Sisters and a slick version of ""... in a River"" by some band I never heard of, everything here is VERY boring. The dance, electonica masacre of ""Rock N Roll..."" is blasphemy and the jazzed/popped up version of ""Gloria"" is aggrivating. Though the rendition of ""Easter"" on here is quite lovely, it falls flat when compared to the heart renching original version. This CD is only seven bucks though, and the softened up version of ""Pissing in a River"" is quite awesome and anything the Swarf Sisters do is incredible, so if you love the swarf sisters or a Smith hardcore, get this CD; you can always laugh at the chick doing some stupid faux... kitten act on ""Because the Night"" in the car."
3,rebuttal of previous review,"In preparation for building a cello, I have successfully built a violin using Mr. Strobel's ""Violin Making Step by Step"". I have reasonalble amatuer woodworking skills and simple but adequate tools and space. I also reviewed all of the reasonably obtainable sources on violin constuction and found Mr. Strobel's books to be more helpful than most. The author recommends the first time builder of a cello to first build a viloin in his preface to ""Cello Making"" and I heartily agree. The price of the wood is much cheaper and techniques can be mastered on a smaller scale. The price of his book is about that of one cello lesson and it will last a lot longer."
4,"Good book but depends on ""vilion steps by step""","It,s a good book with several tips and tricks,measures,ilustrations and templates,the 2 cellos mentionaded by the author is a 4/4 and a 7/8.And in several parts of the book the author mentions ""how meant on violin step-by-step book'' so to fully understand you need to have both books."
4,Must Have for Those Who Fix String Instruments,"My husband is the woodworker in our family; our daughter plays the cello and also is a public school string teacher. Last year she had a cello in bad need of repair but her school budget didn't have the money to repair it, so. . .she brought it home to Dad and they got it fixed. Unfortunately, they had to completely take it apart to fix the problems but didn't have all the supplies to put it back together. Fortunately she could afford to pay someone else to glue it back together. This sparked a seed in my husband to want to learn more about how to work on a cello and we finally found it in this book. NOT FOR BEGINNERS, it does have all the information you need to work on a cello but we recommend also getting the ""Violin Making"" book as the two work hand-in-hand."
2,"a disappointment, really","The book starts off in a good way. The first few chapters are OK. Sadly, it loses its way completely in Chapter 4, where the author tries to give examples from actual research-work and how econometrics is used in them. One expected real illumination here, which is sorely lacking. I would not recommended it to people who are just starting out."
2,"Concise yes, intiutive no","After a promising preface and introduction, this book jumps the shark almost immediately in chapter two when it starts with formulas and terms such as 'probability density function.' It continues with a series of 'statisticspeak' terms, and formulas with random examples mixed in. This is not intiutive in any way. What it really amounts to is condensed econometrics with all the explanations taken out. So, if you can speak statistics fluently, this might be a good book for you. If you are a regular person, don't bother."
1,YUK ! ! !,Have had other Denali tools and have been very happy with them BUT this one I just got their reciprocating saw and attached the new battery fully charged and I hit the trigger and it went BURRrrr and froze up in less than a heart beat... WHAT THE ??? very disappointed.
1,No Batteries Available!!,This product comes with no battery and there's no way to get batteries for this saw. I even did a googles search for the batteries to no avail. The manufacture should not be selling products that the customers will not be able to operate.
2,Consume a lot of electricity from battery,It's really very powerfull but it lasts only tens of seconds with one battery. What can I saw???
2,Cable received not as pictured OR described,"Item listed as - 6-Foot Gold-Plated HDMI Cable Male to Male 28AWG with Ferrite CoreThe cable I received, from SF Planet, had NO gold-plating and NO ferrite cores.I'm sure this cable would work just as well as any hdmi cable, BUT.... HEADS UP....email and CONFIRM what cable you're REALLY ordering BEFORE you purchase (especially if you WANTED one with ferrite cores)."
3,Comfy but not too durable,"Very comfy seat, few people in my group were riding them. But seat ended up a bit crooked and same thing happened with couple of my mates seats."
5,It's a no-brainer!,"Using this book is a no-brainer - which is what I REALLY needed. My husband was just diagnosed with Type II diabetes, and his nutritional needs are critical. We are stationed in Germany and are in the process of moving. I was disheartened when I found that the military dietician is unavailable right now. Other books were confusing - trying to figure out 30% fat calories, etc. This book saved my sanity! The spiral binding and split page design are FANTASTIC and the food is GREAT. Directions are concise and it's easy to prepare a menu and shopping list from the book. Best of all, we're getting nutritious, consistant, easy meals and snacks and half the work is done for us. Some of the books in the series even include smart choices when eating out at fast food restaurants - another bonus. When our doctor and nurses saw these books, they were AMAZED. My recomendation: get all five!"
4,Much more than ok...,"This is one of the great albums of the nineties without doubt.Singh brings so many different kinds of music together and yet creates a beautiful whole.This is where music should be going in the new century,with composers utilising all kinds of music to create new forms. My only gripe is the opening of the traveller..which for me just does not come off...especially after hearing the mix on Cafe del Mar...This is 4 minutes that this disc does not need..Apart from that though..this is one great disc...buy it now...!!!"
4,good stuff,"beautiful, powerful eastern techno/ambient/trip hop. the only part i dont like is the beginning of the first track, the rest is great. anyone who enjoys techno and/or world music will enjoy this one."
4,4 stars and rising...,"Wow. If you ever need to go on a musical journey, there are several of them here. I keep llistening to it and it actually gets better - there's so much depth here. Very atmospheric, superbly influenced by Talvin's Indian origins - a real gem."
3,good aural wallpaper,"OK is a really nice mix of drum 'n' bass, techno, jazz, spoken word, and traditional Indian sounds. I like having it on while working, driving, messing about online, or whatnot; It's upbeat, and keeps the intuitive/artistic part of my brain occupied, but it's not at all intrusive. Fun to listen to."
4,Something special,"When you slide in this CD and listen to the first track, you wil be surprised by the refined sound which will take you on a journey into the spirit world of Indian sounds with some classical intermezzos. After that the pace picks up. A very good CD and a step up from the last (Anokha)...."
1,Appalling,"I found this album a poor excuse just to deliver an album to his fans. The course of evolution usually takes an upward direction. This album takes an immediate nose dive. All the tracks deliver a mystical abstract sound...Yes sound and not music...Thats the problem. If you like sound and not music, thats cool. But if you are looking for some coherence in the tunes forget it, your bet off with a Synthesizer, Tublar and a sitar!!!Peace"
1,This album is not good,Transparent and misdirected. One predictable stereotype after another. This is the kind of music that makes people turn away from electronic music - a shame. Juxtaposition and cross-over can be skillful devices. The artist's use of them here rather resembles an infant driving a Semi-Truck off an embankment.
2,East-West fusion not there yet?,"I'm a big fan of both traditional and electronic music, but I don't think that fusions of the two are working out so well in most cases - OK by Talvin Singh, as well as music by Tabla Beat Science being key examples. I like drum and bass. I love tabla. But then, I like mustard and I like mayonnaise, but not on the same sandwich. Download a couple of these songs and check them out before you buy - some people really dig the sound, but I think it still, at the least, needs further development (""Future World Funk"" is a notable achievement, however)."
5,The sheer majesty of TRAVELLER ...,"The sheer majesty, brilliance, and grace of the first track TRAVELLER sends me into another place."
4,GOOD BUT A BIT DISAPPOINTING,"MICKEY MCDERMOTT WAS QUITE A CHARACTER DRUNK AND SOBER. IN THIS BOOK WE LEARN HE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GOOD MAYBE GREAT PITCHER. HIS STUBBORNESS, EGO AND CONTROL PROBLEMS LIMITED HIS SUCCESS. LATER ON HIS ADDICTION TO BOOZE WOULD ALSO BE A GREAT CONTRIBUTOR. MICKEY TELLS SOME SCARY AND HUMOROUS STORIES BUT THE HUMOROUS ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. HE IS PRETTY HONEST ABOUT THIS DRINKING AND CAROUSING WITHOUT BEING TOO STRONG ON THE DETAILS. HIS HEART PROBLEM IS REALLY INTERESTING AND WHILE RECOVERING HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND/WIFE WIN THE ARIZONA LOTTERY. QUITE A BIT IS BACKED IN THIS BOOK ALONG WITH HIS FRIENDSHIPS WITH FRANK SINATRA, JIMMY CAGNEY AND MANY MORE. I RECOMMEND THIS MOSTLY FOR FANS WHO KNOW WHO MICKEY IS AND PEOPLE WHO NEED A DECENT LAUGH."
2,Only for the highly motivated,"I bought this book (and several others) as part of a plan to learn some Spanish prior to a trip to Ecuador.I will readily admit that I did not make it very far into this book. While I liked the fact that it teaches Spanish for the Western Hemisphere, I had real trouble trying to learn to speak by reading. I did not buy the cassettes that are available for use with this book. I think I would have been more successful if I had.The book also moves very quickly. So if you don't want to go through 3 chapters of ""hi, how are you"" conversation at the beginning, you might like this book.I eventually purchased a learn-from-tape program (Pimsleur, no book needed) that worked for my personal style."
5,Excellent Non-Fiction. As Interesting as the Best Fiction!,"In the early 1970s, Professor Gail Lee Bernstein lived with a rural farming family on Shikoku Island, Japan. There, she recorded the actions, words, thoughts, ideas, and struggles of her host family. As she overcame the initial resistance of her host family, and then eventually, that of the community in which she lived, Dr. Bernstein was exposed to a life that few foreigners have ever had a chance to write about.Haruko (the matron of Bernstein's host family) helped, at and the same times, hindered, the ability of the author to record a true snapshot of the community. Of greatest importance was the interactions between several generations of the villiage's resident women.A must read for students of Japanese History and/or Cultural Anthropology, and a great-if-read if you're anyone else."
3,A life changing experence!,"I picked up this book for my History of Japan class at the University of Oregon. I had some ideas of what to expect, but this book blew me away.I took about 10 pills of aderall and read the book in 20 min. And it was the best 20 minutes of my life. Better then me meeting my wife, and the birth of our two young daughters.Please buy this book, and change your life!"
5,Awesome CD!,John Williams is one of the best classical guitar players I have heard. This collection is well worth the price.
5,One of my favorates,I love the smooth performance of John William. The beutiful melody of rich variety of selections sallows me to enjoy it without getting tired of it. I listen to the CDs almost every time when I work at the desk in my study. They keep me going.
3,Not Bad,"Just not great. It does have an abundance of cuts, but ultimate? Hardly. Some of the music is not what I would call universally pleasant to every ear. For $16 you could do a lot worse."
2,Not My Favorites,"I thought it would be a good classical guitar collection and it might be to some people, but not to me."
4,Solid,This is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album. Now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise. I like almost every song here but I skip about 4 of them and the rest I can listen to all the way through. I recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but I recommend it.
3,"Acer Aspire AS51003577 15.4"" Notebook PC Review","Neither this notebook nor any other computer using MS Vista, should be sold with 512 MB RAM. This deficiency slows and spoils the performance of an otherwise very good machine"
3,really cute but material is weird,"this bag was so cute, but alittle bit too small for me. it was the coated canvas which felt more like plastic to me. unless your are familiar with coated canvas, you may not like it."
4,Love it!,"Looking for just a tea kettle, just want I wanted. Use it often, it's exactly like the photo. Washes up great and always looks good on my stove."
2,Scares my 3 year old,"As an adult, I think this little guy is cute, but my 3 year old daughter is absolutely terrified of it. She demands that it is always turned off and must stay in another room. I don't know what it is about the bear that makes her scared. All I have to do is threaten to get the bear and she does whatever I say. I feel badly that her aunt spent good money for a toy that she will never play with. Can I take it back after I threw out the box? I wish."
3,Hmmm...It's all right I guess,"I got this toy about 2 years ago. I was ten then. And even then I was bored with it. It CAN do a number of things such as drink it's bottle, giggle, ask for a hug, but then these things can only be so exiting. I think that anyone under 7 would probably enjoy this iteam, but anyone over that will get bored of it fairly quickly. So if you're over seven and want a nice fake pet try looking into Scamps my Playful Pup."
1,Bust,"This toy was bust, difficult to use and not very durable. My daughter has already sold at yard sale."
2,Such a disappointment!,"We purchased this toy for our 4 year old daughter. The fun lasted for about 1 hour. It is heavy and hard. The arms are stiff and stick straight out. The motors make too much noise when it moves. Within a month or so, one of the arms was broken. What a WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,Cute bear!,"I just got this cute polar bear for my 3yr.old daughters birthday. She saw it at the store & wanted it so bad but I could not see paying $32 for it. After finding it on sale alot cheaper, I bought it for her.She loves this bear so much! I agree that the motor is a bit loud when the arms move. The cutest thing we think it does, is when it starts making slurping noises when feeding it, he/she sometimes gets the hiccups afterwards. When I first saw this toy I thought it would do alot more, esp for the price I first saw it at. IMO I do not think it's worth more than $20. The legs do not move on their own. He does move his arms & moves his ears, head & snout a little bit. He doesn't really make alot of different sounds. His favorite to make is a whooping sound. One thing that kinda gets annoying after awhile of hearing, is the snorting (just like a pig) he makes while laughing when he's getting tickled.I would buy this toy again b/c my daughter loves it & it is so cute!"
2,Mom in Illinois,"My 5 year old just HAD to have the Panda....well, she got it last Christmas and I must say it makes a really cute shelf knick knack! She played with is a little, but that little bit is still more than the ""Growing hair Dora"" which she has NEVER played with. At least I didn't have to pay full price for the Panda."
2,Scary Little Guy,"I bought this toy for my three year old daughter for Christmas, since she loves toys like this. He definately works but she is absolutely terrified of him, I had never seen her react this way to anything before. The bear had to spend the night in the basement so he would be no where her sight, so needless to say he will be making a trip back to the store. I think this toy if for an older child"
5,About my wishlist,I really like my wishlist. Is it possible to get the stuff on your wishlist for free if you wish and win?
5,Pleased With my Purchase,"For christmas I bought 2 cubs the polar bear and Panda. My girls are ages 3 and 5. My daughters both love playing with their cubs, they enjoy, feeding them and caring for them.They seem durable since my youngest daughter carries her's around by the arm and shoves the bottle in it's mouth a little roughly and it still continues to work. The one down side to them is the battery compartment, it is difficult to get into, and the switch to turn the cubs off completely, is almost impossible. Which makes me appreciate the fact they turn off automatically when not being used."
4,"Enjoyable, although it has flaws.","This movie doesn't always make sense. There are a lot of holes in the plot and things that just don't seem to add up. That said, it's an enjoyable escape. It's not sugary sweet, it's just a nice relaxing movie that makes you feel good."
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!","i love this movie. i like movies that are kind of with a time-warp. sandra bullock's character is living in 2006 and keanu reeves' character is living in 2004. they communicate with each other by writing letters. they put their letters in the same mail box and they some how receive each others letters. it's a one of a kind love story because they truly do fall in love. with their love between letters they want to meet, but how with 2 years apart? this is a must see. and at the end you get goosebumps with a chill... but trust me, you'll love it!"
4,A good love story with a unique twist and fully-drawn characters,"Unlike with the overtly sappy ""The Notebook,"" I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have tremendous chemistry together, and that is the key to a successful love story. The fantasy aspect of the film doesn't bother me, as long as I can suspend my disbelief. The characters are very well-developed and they feel real. The slow pace helps us get to know the characters and allow us to piece the clues together. There is a mystery in there, too. While an earlier event might foreshadow what is to come later, by no means does it spoil the enjoyment of the movie and its satisfying denouement. Yes, there are plot holes and logical flaws and sometimes the timelines are difficult to follow as the editing becomes confusing, but none of them are fatal. For the hopeless romantics, this is a must-see movie."
5,Somewhere in time?,"In the style of Somewhere in time (Christopher Reave and Jane Seymore) lake house presents itself as a mini time machine with the house and Jack (the dog) as the mediums.Does not have the impact or music score of Somewhere in time, but does have two (more) of my favorite acters (Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock).The end the movie left me wanting for only one thing; Where the heck is Jack, and why was he not in the final scene?"
5,The Lake House,"I absolutely love this movie!! It has been one of my favorites in the same genre as ""Somewhere in Time."" I had to purchase it when I saw a edited version on Lifetime TV. I'm so glad I did. The subtle performances from Keanu and Sandra made me realize why i liked their first collaboration so much (Although ""Speed"" was an adrenaline rush instead of a romantic 'moment in time' rendezvous.)I recommend this film to anyone who has the passion to wait for the 'right' one even if its years from now."
1,This Sucked!,"This sucked it was boring and they spent most of their time at the mailbox,I loved the ending tho it was so sweet!!!!"
1,Very Predictable,"My husband and I went to see this movie-he fell asleep an hour into the movie and I witnessed 2 couples walk out of the movie. If you pay attention to this movie, you can guess where the plot is heading within the first 10 minutes. There are alot of holes in the plot which leave you asking, If she's smart enough to be a doctor(Sandra Bullock), why didn't she look up medical records also, if you worked on saving someone's life and they died and you were devasted wouldn't you know who they were?-this will make sense if you see the movie. Could have been a great movie but missed!"
1,It's Like Pain You Can Watch,"This is one of those movies that seems like it has a neat premise, which it does, but it's executed about as skillfully as a cripple riding a half-pipe. If you enjoy predictable, ham-fisted romance with just enough of a clever twist to make yourself feel like you're more intelligent than the people who liked ""Black Book,"" than this is the film for you! If, on the other hand, you don't enjoy having an assault of suck on all of your senses, avoid this movie at all costs."
2,TIPICAL ROMANTIC AND UNSURPRISING BORIED MOVIE,"Well when i went to the movie to show this film, i though tha t this movie could be most interesting. But in the theater, realy i got sleep, becouse the screenplay is fool and the House by the Lake is the most vulgar than any house in any lake.And the Keanu Reaves performance, is poor, i think this actor have a terrible problems about his performance, becouse he have the same face in all of his movies."
5,perfect movie!,"I just loved this movie! It's right up my alley. It has mystery and love and twists and turns that are not expected.....I went to the first showing in my town....sat there and was so engrossed I didn't even notice time was passing, but when it ended I wanted it to go on and on.....Who ever thought of this plot!? Neat! Regis's talked w/ K. on his morning program yesterday and just couldn't grasp the concept....I would have been a much better host to him.....Regis just didn't get the plot when it was explained to him....even I got it...unreal......CJ"
1,oh my oh my,"Personally I like a bit of mystery in a movie. So I don't really care about the how and why of the 2 year time warp.I think it could have been a great movie if the acting wasn't so terrible. Good movies get under your skin, they draw you in. You feel the laughter and pain of the persons that are portrayed. Good movies can take your breath away from sheer laughter, and can move you to tears, often by simple gestures and ""under""acting instead of over-acting. I mean I saw Reeves breaking down and crying after his father died and I wasn't moved at all. It was superficial, artificial and 1-dimensional. I would have liked this nice story to be played well. The story certainly deserves a remake with better acting. This movie is certainly not for keeps. Don't even spend your money to rent it."
5,GOOD,"Finally something different and great. Everytime you watch it, you'll find something new to enjoy."
3,"If you're someone that care about details, skip this one.","Reviews are only valid if coming from someone with a similar taste as you.So if you're someone that cares about details in a movie, like ""this makes absolutely no sense"", you probably won't add this movie to your top 10.It is definitely a cute movie. A love story between 2 people that meet through letters, but they can't meet personally because they live in different times.Fits more into the ""chick flick"" category, but if you're into that kind of movies, go for it. If you're being forced by your girl to watch this with her, just be prepared for a sweet movie, but don't expect a great plot (or even acting)."
4,The Lake House,"Alex (Reeves) and Kate (Bullock) are two lonely people. They each live in a fancy glass house on the shore of Lake Michigan. The same house, in fact. He lives there in 2004, she lives there in 2006. The house's mailbox begins delivering letters through time, and the two are able to communicate, and eventually fall in love. They just have to figure out how to meet.If you can get over the time traveling mailbox, ""The Lake House"" is an enjoyable movie. Reeves and Bullock are together again for the first time since ""Speed"", and one wonders why they have not teamed up again sooner. They have a chemistry that is believable, and you root for the characters to get together in the end. I recommend this film."
2,McCartney's song,"In the movie they dance to a Paul McCartney song that Sandra Bullock says she knows, but the dance took place in 2004 and the song wasn't released until 2005. I guess love letters weren't the only things traveling in time."
4,Time travel romance,"Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves play two people who occupied a lake house at two separate times. Somehow they are able to communicate by letters put in the lake house mailbox, despite the fact that she is living two years in the future from his life. The movie shows scenes of their separate lives, hers as a doctor and his as an architect. Their paths cross in unexpected ways, some planned and some by accident. The premise sounds ridiculous, but somehow these actors make it work and they create an aura that pulls in the audience. This is recommended viewing."
4,Good heartfelt movie,"I just caught this movie last night at blockbuster and decided to try it out. I was actually really impressed by the way that the director and editor made it look how both characters were together talking.As long as you can put aside time fluxuation absurdities, changing a past by information from the future, and all that Doc Brown warns about in 'Back to the Future' this movie is one sweet one in the middle of our crazed, zombie infested, blood/nudity/gory society that actually is worth watching.As for the acting... Sandra Bullock certainly pulls the weight of Keanu Reeves cardboard acting and leaves the movie feeling lighthearted and warm.I certainly enjoyed this movie and would recommend this to anyone who can look past the 'time' problems!"
4,Interesting Plot,"I wouldn't be suprised if this movie gets an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. It's interesting how the time zones are two years apart for the two main characters. The two characters are determined to meet eachother, so they spend all of their time trying to think of ways. One of their ideas seems like the perfect plan, but something mysterious happens to get in the way of it. One scene shows that the two characters have already met in Sandra Bullock's charachter's past, but it is Keanu Reeves's character's present. The two character's plots come together in a suprising way that will shock you. The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because it gets a little bit confusing in the middle, but it's easy to understand after you think about it for a few seconds."
5,This is a heart warming video,These 2 pair of actor and actress really work together they are a pair that know how to warm your heart and give you a good movie to watch. I really enjoyed watching this one. I believe in this film very much. I highly recommend to you this movie. I also recommend adding it to your collection.
3,NOT BAD ROMANTIC FANTASY JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT TOO LONG,"I watched this film with an open mind and through the first half hour or so, I was thinking....""is this as dumb as it seems""? I was interested in the story enough to watch the entire movie and in the end, I thought it was OK. I did figure out the ending long before it happened and some things don't add up, but....it's worth a look with your sweetheart on a lazy rainy day."
2,If you thought this was good you really need to watch the original!,"There's a Korean movie I saw several years ago (2000) which left a lasting impression on me. It was called ""Il Mare"" and was about a man and a woman who are both living at the same lake house but in different times. Sound familiar? ""Il Mare"" was restrained, romantic, tragic, really beautiful, with a bittersweet ending that lingered in the mind long after the movie was over. Despite knowing full well that Hollywood is great at taking brilliant foreign movies and remaking mediocre dumbed down versions of them for American audiences, I still went to see ""The Lake House."" As expected they ruined it. I guess they figured the original Korean ending was not ""happy enough"" for US audiences! Whatever. Anyway, don't take my word for it, go see the original."
2,Boring and sappy,"This was a boring sappy movie. So, surprised because I only rented it bc Sandra Bulluck and Kanu Reeves was in it. Really like both of them. Wasted my movie on this one."
2,Lacking!,"I thought this movie would be really great but was somewhat disappointed byt he end. The movie was boring and predictable, not to mention confusing. I really did expect better from these actors. I won't say this film is terrible but it definitely lacks interest."
5,wonderful!,"[sorry for my english, my mothertongue is french]This is a wonderful romantic movie. Even if the ""space-continuum"" thing is a bit complicated & strange.You'll be delighted by this movie if you let your feelings go while watching this movie."
2,"Good idea, poor writing.",I watched it because the idea seemed interesting but they appear to have spent the budget all on actors salary and none on anything else. SLOW AND VERY PREDICTABLE! Even my wife wants the time spent watching this back.
5,The Lake House,"Thought this would be just a chick flick, I was plesantly surprised. Not to give away the ending but it was worth hanging in for the end. Nice twist to the love story."
5,Love in the Twilight Zone,"This movie is a combination of ""Message in the Bottle"" and ""Frequency"", both very good movies. I love way two people can meet through letters and seem to know each other better then someone they know personally. Also the fact that no fate is set and that messages from the future can help people form the past live on to see their future that they didn't see the first time in history.If you have love in your heart and want to believe that we can influence our past and this is the movie for you. You might need a few tissues if you are soft at lovely endings."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I am normally hesitant about a remake. I held my breath when read that the original Korean edition, Il Mare was going to have a Hollywood makeover. Whilst the original movie was good, it got some bits that remained unresolved and probably would have been done better. I'm pleased to say that this Hollywood version made the transition smoother & more cohesive. Supporting cast is outstanding. Special features of the movie was the extended outtakes that weren't used. Highly recommended for the romantic hearts out there."
4,suspend your disbelief,"You will have to suspend your disbelief in order to get through the story about a man living in 2004 and a woman living in 2006--or maybe the other way around. They are able to correspond with letters in a common mailbox and must try to find a way to get together in person since they form such a strong bond just from writing.Keanu Reeves gives a better performance than usual, while Sandra Bullock is reliably good. They do the emotional scenes well.It moves a bit more slowly than necessary, but has a satisfying conclusion."
4,Chick flick guys will like,"Any movie with Sandra Bullock is worth watching, but this really good chick flick is also one of the few that I enjoyed, as a member of the another male who belongs to the ""Don't like chick flicks lodge"". It's well presented and keeps you wondering how would I approach someone who won't love me for another 2 years. The two lovers are 2 years apart, but a mailbox allows them to send messages back and forth over the 2 year time span, without knowing what the other looks like. The pace of the movie is excellent, and it does challenge your brain. You won't be able to just predict what happens next in this one. This movie is well worth the money I paid for it."
1,The Lake House,"I loved the movie, but when I ordered it, I mistakenly order HD DVD and I don't have HD. The party I purchased the movie from was not willing to exchange it, so while I really liked the movie, my experience purchasing the movie was not successful."
1,reviews only,Please for people who just want to know if the movie is worth seeing please put your comments. But for people who just want to put their judgemental agenda don't bother. Some of actually want to read just reviews.
1,"Stupid, just that.","Movie producers are happier than ever. It's becoming very clear that audiences are liking any piece of garbage they throw on them. If movies like this one gets so much high ratings, it's because audiences simply don't care anymore. Anything will do it.The LAKE HOUSE is atrocious in every aspect, from acting to pace to implausibility, to plot holes, to lack of chemistry."
5,Watch it with someone you love,"This is a beautiful story, beautifully told. I thought both Reeves and Bullock played their parts superbly. Suspend your disbelief, don't search for flaws, and above all accept that such relationships don't only happen in Hollywood. Highly uplifting."
4,I really enjoyed it,The concept of this film is great. At times it is a little hard to follow what time is what. But overall I enjoyed both characters and the romance of it all.
4,Great movie,I really loved that this movie was connected with Jane Austen's Persuasion.Big Jane fan.I really enjoyed watching Keanu and Sandra act together. I know Keanu gets a bad rap for being totally devoid of emotion or character. But this time was different. He was in character and was able to portray the love and lost important to this role. A+
3,It's Okay,"I watched this movie because it was filmed near my old house. I used to stop for breakfast at a spot that overlooks the ""lake house"". I was expecting it to be the stupidest movie ever, but it was actually sort of cute. Even despite it's clumsy plot, refusal to resolve conflicts created by the time travel element and painfully obvious plot twist, there were parts that were sweet and silly enough to make it palatable. Overall, I think if you go in with really low expectations you may be surprised."
3,I love Sandra Bullock but,most of this was just boring. There were a few good scenes but mainly my attention was in and out of the movie. I could spend 15min thinking about something else and come back and find out I hadn't missed anything.
2,"good idea for a film, but ending very confusing","This review is intended for those who have seen the film. Don't read it if you hate spoiler reviews. You've been warned. *** *** *** I liked the idea, but I found the ending very confusing. It seems they got the time line a bit mixed up. He gets killed at the beginning of the movie while she's sitting having lunch with her mother. Yet he is late for his *evening* out with her, as she is having *lunch* in the park. The timing doesn't work out at all as far as I can tell. Other than that, though, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of either of the main stars, but they were both pretty good in this movie.Another big disappointment was the Paul McCartney song ""This Never Happened Before."" That must be one of the most lackluster songs I've ever heard, and this is coming from a long-time McCartney fan."
2,Bad ending,"It really feels like someone tacked on an alternate ending to please the crowd and otherwise ruined a average/good movie.The photography is very nice. You can get into the story, except for the scene with the tree.But the ending, they ruined the movie.I could not find info on the web as to whether the ending was changed after audience testing or not."
4,going back in time...,"Keanu and Bullock, together again... This time it's a romance with a time travel-ish twist: the couple fall in love through correspondence only, and they then realize that they are offset from each other in time by two years. It's the first film in a little while that's made me want to read Jane Austen: Persuasion, in this case. Both characters carry the film well, and they continue to have great chemistry together. The storyline could have fumbled under the weight of its Macguffin, but didn't. Of course, I have a weakness for time-travel type stories, but this film was definitely enjoyable."
2,``The Lake House'' on Blu-ray,"I have to say that I was kind of disappointed by this movie when it was all said and done. I liked the concept of two owners of the same house at different times being able to correspond with each other via the mailbox out in front of the lake house, hence the title of the film. Just that I was frankly a bit put off by how the relationship ended up developing between the two and the lackluster ending. Wish I'd rented this first before buying it, but then again, I got a pretty good deal on the Blu-ray copy."
5,Incredible Love Story,"The lake House is such a wonderful, heart-warming incredible love story.I reaaly enjoyed and had a great pleasure to see this movie.I am sure all the Keanu funs enjoy this movie and can have a great time."
