1,Sure it's beautiful but it also can burn your fingers off.,"I have been looking around for a Crock Pot for sometime now and finally decided to buy the Rival 5445 because of the stainless steel look and because it was oval. The shape is excellent for putting a whole chicken in but don't expect to leave it in there all day because it can get very hot even on ""low"". It was not very well insulated so the pot was even very hot to touch. The steel or metal got so hot the knob cracked off and broke altogether. I don't have children now but it can be very dangerous if you do. I will definately return this one and get one that is better insulated and cool to touch."
2,Too hot for the handles,"Deja vu! I thought I was reading my own words when I read the other customer reviews. Looks great, cooks okay, but the lid doesn't fit. It clanks and drips hot steam all during cooking. To top it off, the outside gets dangerously hot causing the handles to crack and break. Praise the Lord, I was not trying to lift the pot at the time the handles started cracking and breaking off in pieces. It could have been hot wassail all over grandma this Christmas! I'm thinking we may have grounds for a law suit. Reckless endangerment or something."
4,Great Little Slow Cooker,"I love this slow cooker, it's just the right size for a family of 2 or 4. I use it to cook roasts all the time and they turn out excellent. Easy cleanup (except for some stains, which I cannot remove, that appear around the inside where the liquid has cooked all day, but not a big problem). Yes, the outside of the unit gets hot but you just know that from reading the manual and don't touch it with your bare hands!! I also like the lid, it's not as heavy and bulky as some of the other brands so I feel more confident while washing it.I've seen other comments about the lid not fitting....it's not supposed to fit tightly so the steam can escape!! I believe that this issue is addressed in the manual also."
3,Confused,I am in search of the 'perfect' slow cooker. The one I ordered initially is now unavailable. I searched at epinions and all the reviews thought that this rival 5445-BC was a great slow-cooker and yet everyone here hates it. I am confused.
2,not what I expected,One of the items I regret buying. Even my daughter didn't want to bother watching it after the first time. Poor quality DVD.
2,Waste of money,"I bought 3 DVDs and 2 flash cards package hoping to make a super kid out of my 2-year-old. To my surprise the Alphabet and Phonics DVD did not offer any creative teaching tool. Little ones learn better when the information is packaged in the form of music,songs and some dance. This DVD had no songs or action, just some elevator type background music.It fell short of any PBS kids programs. My son didn't pay attention after 10 minutes.The flash card is very attractive but a 2-year-old might find some unfamiliar animal names and words. I found similar flash cards at Walgreens for much cheaper price.I didn't want to open the rest of the DVDs or flashcard, I sent my purchase back and got a refund."
3,Works really well until half way down,"I love this candle and I bought 4 of them but everyone of them has the exact same issue once the candle burns half way down, they dorwn themselves in wax. Did i just buy duds? I loved teh nouise and the scent but having to digg out and remove wax to keep them burning is a pain in the you knwo what."
2,sent wrong scent!,"Not sure about quality of candle, but they sent me Cinnamon when I ordered Vanilla! Not worth the hassle of returning - I think they should be more conscientious with their shipping practices."
4,Love wood wick,Great candle slightly smaller then expected maybe that's my fault. I have only ever seen woodwick in two sizes and thought this was the smaller of the 2 sizes I had been aware of. This however is even smaller then expected. For the price I would not have bought such a small candle. The smell and design of the over all candle are fabulous. Only complaint is the size for the money.
3,Love the candle but...,"I sent this candle to a close friends mother in Michigan for a Christmas present, however upon opening this present today I was informed the candle was broken which was a bit of disappointment. I've sent a few Woodwick candles to other friends, but never encountered this problem. She was able to super glue it back together which was good, but I would have liked it to arrive in one piece! Besides this I love the candles, and they smell great!"
3,Great smell but annoying noise,I love candles but this candle didn't convince me as for the aroma i cant complain its good not too strong but it is the damn cracking noise that is annoying to me. If I would of had known it made this noise I wouldn't had purchased this.
2,Bright and loud...,"My first experience with crackle candles was the one brand carried by Target stores. At about half the price these candles give off a light scent with the sound of a gentle rain. Out of curiosity I tried the Woodwick candle and made comparisons. This candle sounds more like a hail storm or a roaring furnace. And for some reason the wick does not stay level with the wax as it burns. With the wick sticking out about an inch this results in a flame, which shoots beyond the height of the glass container. It easily lights up my entire bedroom. I'm going to return to the Target candle."
4,more than A-Z,ferns are some of my favorite plants. This is a great book and I have had it a while I use it every time I teach a class on ferns. I really like the comarison shots of the different selection. THose really help to Identify labeless plants. I would have like some of the info in a bullit points at the beging or end of each enrty. for height hardiness and the like the stuff that every entry should have this would have made the book easier to use. BUt that doesn't mean I wouldn't get it I love this book. It is a must have.
3,Great except for the Black Ink,"The colored ink was just fine for my printer, it was the perfect fit. But the black it came with was not. My printer takes a different black than the one in the box now I'm stuck with it. But it was still a good price."
1,Black cartridge will not work in printer,"The 3 color cartridges work, but not the black cartridge. The black cartridge is the wrong size. Don't understand why the black would come in the same pack when it doesn't fit the printer."
1,Poorly packaged for shipping,Received the ink cartridge packed in a bubble wrap envelope. The ink pack packaging was smashed flat. The cartridge could well have been damaged. This is the first time I've received one in this condition--they've always been better packed.
2,canon ink cartridges,"Nothing wrong with the Canon product, but the packaging had been crushed during transit, and one of the ink cartridges leaked. At the time of purchase I only needed a replacement for the Photo Magenta cartridge....care to guess which cartridge was the leaker???The vendor wanted me to send the entire package back for a refund, then re-order another. Since it took over a week to receive the first one, I opted to try the leaking cartridge; after a brief clean-up in the kitchen sink, it seems to be working okay."
1,Recieved the wrong product.,I received the wrong color ink and the shipper did not have anymore of the color I ordered. I decided to keep it instead of spending more money returning it. I will use the tank eventually.
3,CLI-8 4-Pack,"The product works; big deal.What is really important is the cost of the product -- INK! If one converts the few thousands of a litre of ink into gallons, this ink costs THOUSANDS of dollars per gallon. And some people think the oil companies are gouging the price of gasoline!"
4,No Problems,This ink has worked just fine for all of my needs. I prefer to buy the ink from the manufacturer and Amazon offers them at the lowest price. I like that the colors are separated so I only need to replace each color when it actually runs out. I've switched over to laser for all my BW needs but still use this printer (and ink) for any of my color prints.
1,Packaging Extremely Poor,"I received my Canon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink Tanks that were sent in a thin cardboard box in a bubble lined package. The package had been left in my mailbox for hours. It is 95 degrees right now with a heat index of 99.5 degrees. When I opened the package, the box had been damaged on every side, and top and bottom. I took pictures because it was so bad. This would have been avoided if the sender had shipped the item in a box.I would rather pay full price than deal with this kind of service.The bad thing about this is the inconvenience even if the sender offered me an exchange or refund."
4,Colorful Packaging,"OK, before you order this, make sure it's the right ink for your particular printer. Dang it. I guess I'll donate it to the local school or something."
4,printer ink,It's so easy to get the right printer ink when I order it from Amazon - I don't have to worry about quality or delivery - it just is there.thanks
4,"High quality, but extremely expensive",The short and sweet is this:Quality of printed results-Wonderful.Value for the money-The worst.
2,More than one ink tank of the following color is installed,"""U071 - More than one ink tank of the following color is installed"" I got this error for the second time. Obviously there is a problem with the chips on the inks. I could not return the inks. It was to late."
3,Refurbished Not Worth It,"I purchased the refurbished tanks on the off chance that the cheap price might be worth it. So far, I have noticed the black especially does not reproduce properly. Instead of black I get some weird purple cast. If the photo does not have a lot of black, it is better.I have used 3 of the colors (not yellow) so far. I would say that if you want pictures of the same quality as those printed from official Cannon ink then you will not be happy with these. If you want something so that you can produce ok prints, then the price makes this acceptable."
1,"Beware if your printer requires the ""chip""","I made the mistake of not realizing my printer required the ""chipped"" version of this ink. So, I'm sure the product is fine but just make sure of what you need before ordering."
1,"amazon says these cartridges will work with my printer, but will they?","I have a canon pixma ip 4000. I bought this set of cartridges from Amazon, not noticing that they are 8's, not 6's, (which we have always bought), because the menu said yes! these cartridges will work with your printer. Before I open the box, does anyone know if this is true? My printer is not among those listed on the box.thanks"
4,Nice combo,I wanted ink for my MP970 color printer. I didn't want to mess around shopping for each color. I live out in the country and did not want to be without the color I needed. I like these multipaks. I wish the prices would come down though. I have used generic ink from Ink 4 Less in the past and have been satisfied but if Canon would continue to offer these handy mulitpaks at a reasonable cost I would definately use the Canon brand.
2,NOT FOR MX 700,Need to have a boxed set dedicated for the Canon MX 700 since this black ink will not work and need the bigger size PGI-5BK. For the Canon MX 700 buy the three color set CLI-8 & buy the black separately.
4,Canon inkjet color cartridges,I have found the Canon cartridges always perform better than off brand. However the printers use lots of ink and usually tell you that you are about out of ink and your cartridge will be half full.
4,Canon Ink Tanks,These tanks work well of course and the Canon printer prints near photo quality images. No complains about the system except for the cost of the 6 tanks needed to run the process; that is why 4/5 stars. Right now another difficulty lies in finding 1 vendor who carries all 6 colors; Amazon does not directly so I had to use 3 different vendors to get all 6 tanks. I'm sure that will change in time.
4,Don't purchase for PIXMA ip4200,I purchased this for my PIXMA ip4200 Canon printer. The 'will this work with my printer' feature assured me it would work with my printer. It didn't! I credit Amazon with a quick response and refunding of my money. Just wanted to save anyone else from making this mistake. Canon and Amazon are both excellent companies.
4,"Nice inks, wish they recycled","I am the satisfied owner of two canon printers (Pro9000 and MP620) and am a relatively low volume, high quality printer user. I can't add anything specific regarding the quality of these inks, however I would like to point out that while the price is less on Amazon, Staples does have a very nice recycling program for used ink cartridges of all types. I would say that tossing these when they are empty may not be inline with Amazon's new greener packaging initiative, and return mailers (uninsured, and not tracked) may be a cost-effective way to improve overall user experience for this product."
2,CAUTION: Ink EXPRESS may not send GENUINE Retail Box item,"Order two different ink from Ink Express. Yellow ink sent was in original retail packaging and black in was in a bubble wrap with paper stating it was genuine. Be cautious when ordering from this third party seller as I have never had any other seller send me just a bubble wrap product. Description of the product is for retail box item. I expect a retail box product. Even if it may be a genuine product, I felt deceived. I have order dozens of ink off of amazon and everyone came in a retail box."
1,Dont Buy-Doesnt last long,Got these at the end of August and I dont do that much printing and ONLY lasted 3 months.Spending $$$ X 4 each year-Ridiculous!I am going to look for ones that can at least last double the length of time.
5,BUY THE REAL STUFF,I always buy the real stuff. I don't trust the refill one or compatible one. I use the ink to print photographs so I need something that I can rely on. Canon so far produce the best quantity. I highly recommend it.
3,Canon inkjet color cartridges,Canon cartridges always work without flaw. They just don't last long enough. And your Canon inkjet printer will tell you your cartridge is nearly empty when it can still be half full.
3,great service,"I was very please with the quick delivery and attention I received. These ink tanks are a pain in the neck to track down, no store sells them. Thanks for stocking them and for the price.Paula"
5,cost effective,I will no longer purchase from office supply stores if I continue to find these ink cartridges at these prices at amazon. Even generic versions of the same ink did not come close to the price offered here. Shipping was timely and the product was no different than what I could find at a big box store.
1,Does not work with Canon MP980,"I ordered a Canon MP980 printer and purchased the recommended ink 4 pack CLI- 8. The cartridges are much too big and now 9 months later, I found that out. Luckily, Amazon will let me return it."
2,Beware with this seller,"Several of the inks (which I noticed after I had used some and tried to use one of the defective ones) were missing a part and unusable. I did not realize it and when I took cover off one, the ink leaked out and I now have a permanent stain on the carpet. Ink is good, I would just buy elsewhere."
5,I Couldn't Ask for More,"First quality, great price, and faster than expected delivery. I could not have asked for more. BTW, the Canon iP4200 is a great low priced printer."
2,Nice quality but programmed to get you to by ink,"Overall I'm very pleased with the quality and speed of this printer. One huge complaint I have and this has been confirmed by others as well, is that the printer software will warn that the printer cartridge is out of ink, I take it out snap it back in (the same cartridge) and it will print another 200-300 pages and more.. I had this printer for 2 years now and has been confirmed by me several times. So, I think it's time for someone to start a class-action suit against Canon as this is an outright intentional fraud that's programmed into the printer and the software so the consumer buys ink from them when it's not even needed!"
4,Cheaper at NewEgg,I used to buy a lot of ink for my Pixma here at Amazon but I recently found it cheaper at NewEgg.
3,Companionable but short term.,"Less than a single's month's use from the cartridge, and I don't do photos--some ""moderate"" internet downloading for class. Time to go into a more lucrative profession and invest the entra bounty in Canon stock. [Beware of Canon's confusing marketing. The CLI-8PC (P = photo) is currently going for twenty cents more than this one. I'd like to know why ""not"" select that one. Also, this Cyan cartridge is available as part of a Canon 4-pack, which may seem to be the better value--but only until you discover you've gone through 5 multipacks and accumulated four unopened Black 8s.)"
2,Double-check for compatibility.,"Not compatible with Canon MX700, for one, and I found that out the hard way. Seems I'm not the only one to have this trouble. Amazon was prompt in issuing me a refund, even months after I ordered this item, but don't trust the rubric on this page. I'm baffled at how they can even pretend this cartridge works for such a wide array of printers."
5,CLI-8 Photo Ink,"Although more expensive, I have found that original manufacture replacement ink gives far clearer and accurate color."
2,Rip-Off,"The quality of this product is fine, especially for photos, but if you do any printing, Canon has priced themselves out of the market with these SMALL, EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, PROPRIETARY cartridges. With this set up you are constantly replacing cartridges and emptying your wallet!!"
3,"Product: 5 stars. Packaging: Eh, not so much.","I'm a huge fan of Canon ... never had any problems with their printers (I've had three) or their ink. Superlative quality. But they must know that, of the eight colors in this pack, you're going to cycle through SIX of them several times before the green and red run out, even once. So to be kind to their loyal customers, you'd think they'd have a special six-color pack, sans red and green; they don't. And buying colors individually is WAY more expensive than buying the combo packs. So I wind up reordering this product, while I've got three greens and three reds, just sitting here collecting dust. Canon could stand to get a bit more customer-friendly..."
3,Great print quality in a not so convenient package,"I recently purchased a Canon Canon Pro 9000 MKII to replace an Epson 2200 photo pinter. I find the print quality using this printer to be outstanding in comparison to the Epson. The color rendered by these inks are very accurate and the detail provided by the Pro 9000 MKII is easily seen as superior to the Epson 2200- as it should be since the Epson is 8year old technology.I purchased the 8 ink tank multipack to tray and save money. I rated the multipack as 3stars because, while it is less expensive than buying individual ink tanks, a more cost effective option that Canon should offer is a 4pack that would include 1 cartridge each of Photo Magenta, Photo Cyan, Yellow and Cyan. These are the colors that are used by the printer by a factor of 2 to 1 of the others."
5,Excellent Ink,Great ink and great printer from Cannon. Pictures come out clear and bright and happy with it so happy with it
4,Canon CLI-8 4-Color Ink Tanks as expected,Canon CLI-8 4-Color Ink Tanks product was as expected. It isw a Canon ink tank and they do a consistent good job.
4,Works!,"Expensive, but always does the job! When it goes on sale, I buy more. Otherwise, take a chance on 3rd party inks."
4,"Good images, thirsty printer",Our Canon printer produces great text and graphics with these ink tanks. Just brace yourself for the alarming rate at which you'll consume these pricey but necessary items.
1,My Printer was Ruined,"I've always used only Canon ink that came in original packages.The seller sent me 2 ink cartridges that were NOT in the original packages.Now, less than 6 months later, my printer is completely ruined.My printer takes 5 different ink cartridges. But, the only ink that is causing me problems is the one that was delivered to me without the original packages. %150 printer and a complete supply of ink going into the garbage thanks to this product off of Amazon."
3,"Works well,but is overpriced.","Real Canon ink simply works. Consistent color, never clogs.Unfortunately, the capacity of these CL8 cartridges is very low and they are drastically overpriced."
3,No correct for MX700,"The Amazon ""widget"" where you enter your model # and it reports back re compatibility said it was appropriate for the MX700. Be aware that the black cartridge in this 4-pack will NOT work with the MX700. I just trusted the info on the website. It wasn't until I got to the point of actually needing to replace cartridges that I found it requires the PGI-5BK, not the CLI-8BK in the pack. I was in the middle of a project when I learned this and had to buy a higher priced, correct black cartridge locally. This tool/info should get fixed so others know not to buy it as they won't be able to use 1 of the 4 ink tanks in the set. I was lucky on this in that I also own an MX970 which does use the CLI-8BK."
3,The black doesn't fit to Pixma ip3500,"The black ink cartridge in this package wasn't compatiable with the Pixma ip3500. I have to go to Wal Mart to get the black ink. The spec is not right. However, the color ink cartridges fit well."
4,Canon 8C,"As always, very expensive, but much cheaper than local office supply stores and ordered in quantity you even ge free shipping. Canon inks are the best and I warn you against ever trying the cheaper ""compatible"" inks...they are total crap."
3,"Nice ink, but too expensive.","Canon makes a quality ink, but the purchase price is extremely high. Then the printer flushes the majority of the ink in preparing to print. After keeping track of ink costs for two years, I calculate that I have an average cost of $8~$10 per 13"" x 19"" print, each!"
3,Ink,"Since this is the only ink that will work in my printer, I had no choice but to purchase it. I wish the manufacturer would tell us why it is so costly."
5,great and cheap,i like buying from Amazon because the shipping is cheap and I can save so much money by buying from them.
3,Beware Canon MP520 printer owners!!!,"Just a warning to others like myself who own the Canon MP520 All-In-One printer, scanner, etc. Under the product description, it states that the CL1-8 4-color multipack will work with this printer. The three color tanks, blue, magenta, and yellow,(#8) will work, but the black cartridge will not. The black refill cartridge for the MP520 does not take the number #8, but the number #5 replacement. Therefore, I gave this item three stars for the three usable ink carts. Just beware of the mis-information listed on Amazon through Canon."
3,Canon MX-700,"This product indicates that it is compatible with the Canon MX-700. However, the black cartridge is not compatible. The 3 color cartridges are compatible. The price for the 3 color cartridges usually runs about $40. So do not buy this product for the Canon MX-700."
2,Multipack Ink Tanks,"Although it was suggested that I purchase this multipack ink tank package with my Canon MX700 printer, the black ink cartridge was not the correct size. So, this was a waste of money and an inconvenience."
1,WARNING not compatible with 8C,"WARNING even though this fits in the place of the 8C cartridge and is the same color as the 8C most commonly used, it IS NOT COMPATIBLE and will not work except perhaps in a few printers. I thought this might be an improved version for my printer and bought it. When it came time to change cartridges, I opened this one and installed it only to find it WILL NOT WORK. Now, I'm out the money for this and my printer WILL NOT WORK until I go out and buy an 8C cartridge at least 30 miles away. The irony is that I only need to print with black anyway with the job that will have to wait for a few days. Thanks for nothing Canon."
1,Amazon's Inks broke totally my printer,"I bought from Amazon Canon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink Tanks. I installed them recently. Couple days after all the ink tanks leaked in the printer. Now, my printer is totally unusable. I claimed to Amazon for a new printer. I am waiting for their reply. Hopefully, Amazon will take the responsability and replace or refund my printer."
2,Beware! Not for the MP800 Printer,"Almost the same name as the CLI-8C except for photos, right? No, this will not work in the PIXMA MP800 printer. Be careful when you order. This is for the PIXMA iP6600D or PIXMA MP950 only."
1,DO NOT ORDER IF YOU HAVE A PIXMA MX 850 or 860 (or certain other canon printers),"If you go to the web page for the MX 850 or 860 and click on the link for ink cartridges, it takes you to this box of cartridges. While this package looks like a good deal based on the price, this is the ink cartridge set for another line of Canon printers. Half of the cartridges in this box do not work on the 850/860 line of printers."
2,Check which CLI-8 you need...,"Hi, I'm sure the ""photo magenta"" is a good/very good product, but it didn't fit in my printer. I got confused on the model numbers of the ink cartridges. Check again before you buy!"
1,THIS IS NOT FOR THE i9900!!!,"I LOVE Amazon, and this is the first time that I have been lead astray. I typed in i9900 (as I have a Canon i9900) and purchased this ink set. I did see the ""6"" edition come up too, but I figured that I needed the ink for all 8 colors. I sure hope this doesn't mess up my printer!!!"
1,CLI-8 4 Pack,"It's misleading for Amazon to bundle a CLI-8 4-pack with a PGI-5BK 2-pack. These cartridges are for different printers. And, all Canon ink is outrageously expensive."
4,Ink can smear when highlighted,For a few years I used an Epson printer to print out USPS shipping labels on plain copy paper. I used a bright green highlighting marker to highlight the words DELIVERY CONFIRMATION . It never smeared. Recently I changed to a Canon MP810 and when I highlight these labels (about 10 minutes to an hour or more after printing) the ink smears. Other than that I have no problem with this ink (although I have not used it for color printing yet).
3,Not as good as described,"I bought the refilled cartridges and found that not all of the cartridges are recognized by my machine. For example, I had to go out and buy a new Yellow because both the yellow cxartridges were useless."
3,Good but doesn't last long,The ink is good but it seems to run out faster than the others. It seems to be used quite a bit when printing in greyscale or Black.The price could be lower but that's how the printer companies make their money!
5,Arrived quickly,"Received quickly, but I have not used the product. I haven't changed my cartridges yet--ordered early--before I need them."
4,Canon quality-but pricey,"This tank has a chip with a LED on it.So far there are no direct after market replacements for it(there are some without the chip-they say you can use the old chip).You must use Cannons.These CLI-8s contain only 13 ml.which is less than the older BCI-6s 15 ml.the older ones cost half as much for genuine Canon and there are many excellent aftermarket ones available.However,they do work to Canons usual perfection."
4,"Quality is great, price on Amazon is the best","We have the Canon Pixma MP830 and use these ink cartridges. This is our first Canon printer of any kind and we were surprised at how fast the ink empties out and how expensive they are to replace. I searched online for a few days to see if I can find genuine Canon cartridges anywhere else...but Amazon turned out to have the best price, plus I've been shopping here for years so I know I can trust the products that they sell. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because these cartridges run out so quickly and they are so expensive to replace."
5,Canon Ink Preferred,"Have been using Canon 8 ink in my Canon Pixma iP520 photo printer for over 3 years. I sell prints from this printer.I teach digital photography and recommend printer manufacturer's inks to assure quality results. ""Compatible ink"" means ink cartridge will work in that printer. Quality varies considerably."
3,5 Stars for the Canon item in the box; 1 Star (or Less) for the Purported Canon Item in the Bag,"Initially, my order was filled by Amazon.com with an ink tank that arrived in a grey plastic bag. The description on the outside of the bag purported to state that the bag contained a genuine Canon ink tank; however, my printer wouldn't recognize the tank after I installed it. (This had NEVER happened before.) Amazon.com replaced the item with an ink tank which arrived in the ""usual"" Canon box, and upon installation this tank was immediately recognized by my printer (as were all other ""genuine"" Canon tanks).So beware of ""substitute"" products - especially substitute Canon ink tanks which are packaged in grey plastic bags. My ""star"" rating for this item is 3: the average of 5 (for the replacement ink tank) and 1 (for the intital ink tank sent to me by Amazon.com)."
4,Check multipacks carefully...,"I ordered this pack in 2008 and just today needed to add the black tank to the printer. When I went to install I found that the cartridge was missing the plastic pressure tab that holds the cartridge in place. It looked like it was manufactured without it. I cut the tab off the empty cartridge and was able to wedge it in place. The printer did recognize the new cartridge and print, but obviously the cartridge is not snug in the compartment and I'm not sure how long it will last. It's too late in the game to ask for a refund/replacement, so I've lost about $13.00. Learn from my mistake and check each cartridge in the multipack for the plastic tab."
5,Canon CLI-8 4-Color Ink Tanks,"These OEM tanks have never given me problems. I will recommend to those interested to always use OEM ink tanks, and try to avoiding using compatibles whose prices are temptingly low."
3,Canon replacement ink tanks for Pixma printers,"Replacement cartridges perform well but are quite short lived and are consumed quite rapidly, even though we make relatively few color copies. The black and yellow cartridges were consumed most quickly. Why yellow would be used so quickly when the vast majority of copies are black, is a mystery for me!"
3,Always buying ink,"I used to be happy with my Canon color printer situation... that is until I realized that every time I print a few pages in color, one of the ink tanks needs to be switched. It's very annoying and expensive.I have a laser printer that prints 10,000 pages before the toner cartridge needs to be replaced. My current printer (and this ink) seems to last for about 25-50 pages, and only persuades me not to print very much in color. That defeats the purpose of me buying the printer and this ink in the first place."
3,Beware Ink & Toner Finder errors!,"If you actually have a printer that uses all these inks (Pro 9000), then great and the ink is just fine.Be careful tho, as the Amazon Ink & Toner Finder lists this multipack as compatible with other printers as well, such as the Pixma MP970. Yes, technically you can use 6 out of the 8 in the box, but the MP970 does not use Red or Green ink so you're faced with either throwing them away or trying to find someone to sell those extras two cartridges to.Not cool, Amazon. If the pack is partially compatible, then say as much in the Ink Finder!"
3,It's printer ink?,"What can you say, it's printer ink; it works; it's too expensive like all printer inks."
2,"These inks have to be replaced very often,","However nobody can beat Amazon.com price on this item plus free shipping.These inks for MP830 PRINTER. Quality of the prints is good , but inks ran out fast.Bundling inks are one of the reason I keep buying more inks when out. You can not use the printers other functions such as fax , copy etc. due to ""ink tank need replacement ""If one of the ink runs out. message pops up although black ink is full. Over all I am not happy with printer and usage of the ink.Canon needs to load up more ink on these ,if that happens I may stick with it for a long time. If not I will be switching over to another brand."
5,Lasts long,"I really like my Cannon printer. Though there are several cartridges they really seem to last a long time and each cartridge is around $14.00, better than $30 - $40 a cartridge!"
5,cli-8bk,The product was Genuine Canon as it stated. The genuine canon products seem to work the best in my canon printer.
3,"Canon ink works best, but is too expensive","Real Canon ink simply works. Consistent color, never clogs.Unfortunately, the capacity of these CL8 cartridges is very low and they are drastically overpriced."
4,Canon ink cartridge,Have always used these branded cartridges and been extremely satisfied with their quality. The only problem is that they have small reservoirs and are too expensive. The Amazon price is competitive with what is out there.
2,Amazon mixup,"This is a review of Amazon linking this Ink Pack to the MP-520 as a bundle package. Unfortunately, the black cartridge in this pack does not fit the MP520 printer. The rest of the colors do. I'm offering this review to make sure those with the MP-520 do not end up like myself with a black cartridge that does not work.Cheers,MikePS: I was able to finally talk to an Amazon customer service rep regarding their mistake in linking this product to the MP520 printer and am getting a refund. Amazon is being gracious in this matter since I had already opened the ink cartridges."
5,Fast delivery,great price for these inks. I wish Canon made a multi pack of the photo cyan/photo magenta. Those are the inks that run out the most.
2,Overpriced,"The product is good 9 out of 10 times. But, always keep your receipt and box in case you need to return, because it is not uncommon to have an ink cartridge stop shortly after purchase, well before the ink is out. Anyway, my real complaint about this product is the pricing. I go through enough of these expensive ink cartrigdes to pay for a new printer several times over in a 1-2 year span. My current printer is the Canon MP830."
3,Good but pricey,I like the quality of the print-outs but the ink is pricey (I know that's the business model for printer manufacturers).
4,your only choice,"After buying a 'compatible' ink package, went back to this. It is obscenely expensive for what it is Note that the compatible inks (which are probably just as good, it's just the jimmy rigging of getting it to work that is the problem) cost about $3.00 a tank, as compared to about $13 a tank for these, and the only discernible difference is the micro chip thingy Canon puts on each cartridge to keep you from using reasonably priced ink from other manufacturers. It sucks, but the fact is these work, the others just don't, at least in my experience."
5,Canon Ink,"The bottom line is if you own a Canon printer, what choice's do you have ?????? The Canon printers with Canon Ink do a wonderful job. But the overall expenses per picture is more than double the box store printing prices.Amazon makes it possible to remove some of the pain of home printing.Thanks, Obie"
4,canon cli-8 ink tanks,"The Canon CLI-8 ink tanks seem to perform well and somehat consistent as I am still trying to decide as it is a new product for me. The only thing I noticed for sure is the lack of tonal range and contrast control, but that probably is because there is only one black ink in this printer instead of two or three. Other than that they do a fine job."
1,not compatible,"The black ink cartridge is not compatible with the Canon Pixma MX700 even though they are bundled together. Here is what Canon says:The color inks bundled in the multi-pack are compatible with the MX700,however, the CLi-8BK ink tank is not compatible with the MX700. Wesincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, thepack you purchased is a multi-pack, which includes all the colors andthe CLi-8BK. You may need to separately purchase the PGi-5BK ink tank.We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.So, don't buy this four-pack thinking you can use the black ink."
2,"Great Amazon price, but have to buy WAY too often","I've been fairly happy with the quaility of these inks through my Pixima printer. But, I somehow let my normal a-retentive research slip and purchased this printer before finding out about the ink supply. Before purchasing a printer, always find out what ink it uses.I bought this set up so I could print my own pictures from home. That is SUPPOSED to save you money from going to a photo shop. Add the cost of the ink & glossy photo paper and this printer/ink/paper combo can be over .10/picture higher that getting them professionally developed!NOT COOL, Canon."
1,wrong ink for my machine,"I don't know how this happened, to be fair, but amazon shipped me this inkthat's totally incompatible with the printer."
3,multipack canon ink,Be careful if you have a Canon with only four ports for printing. Additionl colors won't work without some sort of chip. If this had been a multi-pack with two of each basic color it would have been a good deal. Maybe they should include that in the advertisement that you need an additional chip to use the other colors.
1,Don't get confused!!!!,"This item will not work with PIXMA MP810 printers. None of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit. I am now the proud owner of a CLI-8PC ink tank that is completely useless to me. I suppose it's my fault since, when I looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem. Let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake!"
5,Great.,"I actually have a Canon PIXMA iP6600D printer (which doesn't use the red and green ink cartridges) but this was the cheapest I could've bought the other inks anyway. Otherwise, I would've had to buy all the inks separately (6 of them at $12 each). The item shipped in very little time and got here before some packages that my husband had ordered the week before."
5,Canon 8PC Cartridge purchased through Amazon,I ordered two of these ink cartridges through Amazon.com online and was amazed when they arrived in a day or two. This was very fortunate because my existing 8PC ink ran out sooner than I expected. The Canon ink works great as always.
4,Canon Ink,"Needed coloured (Magenta) Ink for my Canon Printer. It arrived OK within the expected time-frame. I usually buy this product from the local Costco. It was not in stock. As always, Amazon produced the goods with the usual quick response efficiency ~ and I was up and running again. Cost is a little higher than from the local Costco ~ and it takes a little longer."
5,Canon CLI-8M Magenta Ink Tank,"You have the BEST prices -- better than even the bargains at eBay -- so I look forward to replenishing from you!Re: quality, I will NEVER buy a Canon printer again! The colors run if paper gets slightly moist. Don't see that with the HP printer!"
3,Lowest price way to purchase original Canon cartridges,All OEM cartridges seem overpriced. This 8-pack is the lowest cost per cartridge way to buy the original Canon CLI-8 cartridges I have found so far.
5,"It is yellow ink, and it works fine in my IP6600D printer","Not much else to say! I don't print photos very often, so I can't comment on how well the ink stands up to time, but it works fine for regular document printing."
4,Make sure you know what your printer uses,"I was happy to get a multipack with all 4 inks, 3 color and 1 black. I typed in my printer number and everything, and it showed they will work with my printer. I have a Canon MX700, the 3 color inks uses CLI-8, but the black is NOT CLI-8. So I can use the color inks, but not the black one.Funny thing was that I bought the multipack because I needed a new black ink, so at the end I went to office max and bought the black ink. So just make sure you know what your printer actually use before you buy the multipacks."
2,Wrong ink for MX700,"This ink was listed as the correct ink for the MX700 under the ink finder information presented by Amazon. The color ink is correct but, the black ink will not work in the MX700.Since it was still an ok price for just the color inks, I didn't return it.Like all color ink, you don't get much for your money. Anyone ever calculate the price per gallon on this? $15 per 13ml.There are 3,785 ml to a gallon, so, there are about 291 of these little ink cartridges in a gallon. That's $4,365 per gallon for this ink."
2,Bait and Switch,I have not tried this product yet but it arrived in a non-Canon package by shipper different than listed in original order (Ink Express). Ink Tank came in a bubble package claiming to be from a Canon Asset Recovery program whatever that is. Doubt this is a true Canon product.
5,Glad I bought this ink,"I used to get ink that was done by internet companies at a lower price than the brand name but could not do that with my Canon MP600. I was a bit frustrated over that since ink tends to get expensive. I ordered this ink because it is well priced here at Amazon compared to other stores and the free shipping makes it even better. The ink arrived pretty quick and installed soooo easily. The color of the inks are beautiful and smooth looking. Considering there are 4 ink tanks, the price is not that bad at all. I will definitely order my ink from Amazon again."
5,Ink for my CANON MP830,"It is Ink made by CANON for CANON printers, what could go wrong? Just make sure it is compatible with your printer. I know for sure it is compatible with the MP830. GREAT PRICE AMAZON, THANKS!"
4,"Good product, but....","Printing a lot less color prints, because of price. Never thought I'd try generic ink, but taking a chance."
1,Not the ink for the Canon 980,"Amazon knows that I bought this printer. When I needed some ink, I used the ink finder which correctly identified my printer. However, the ink it identified IS NOT the correct ink for the printer. I did not realize the error until I tried to put a cartridge in my printer. Therefore I was unable to return it and am out the full $45 cost. It is a costly error."
1,Overpriced,"So why buy a printer for $90 then $200 on ink? Why not buy refilled ink for a fraction of the cost of the OEM stuff? If it breaks the printer (or clogs it) after the first time, who cares? You are still ahead of the game. Never buy OEM ink, huge waste of money."
1,wronk ink,Amazon has done this twice to me now that they recommend the wrong ink for my printer. I know in someways its my fault for not making sure but inks looks so much alike and there are so many models for example the my printer is mp480 and this ink i bought went up all they way to mp470 i mean this is getting difficult to keep up with this stuff. THe ink looked exactly the same but it differed a little in size. I don't buy from stores because usally they are ridicously expensive and sometimes they don't even have the ink your looking for. I finally found the correct ink and they don't even reccomend it for my printer. But i do like the return policy that amazon has and that is something i found out is great about this site. This ink toner finder is the only problem i ever had with amazon but the return policy was very simple so i can't get to mad at them. I think the real problem is there are too many printer models and different ink cartrides!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Beware! Not for the MP800 Printer,"This ink tank is the same size, and shape and fits the Pixma MP800 all-in-one printer but it does not work. Even though it is for photos and has photo in the name, this only works with the Pixma iP6600D or the Pixma MP950. The correct ink tank replacement for the Pixma MP800 is the CLI-8M. The items are to closely labeled and easily confused especially when you are thinking of printing photos."
1,Good price,"Was buying 6 at a time, sent stock that was returned from another store with stickers still on the packages and old packages. open up one of the colors and one of the inks had dried up or leaked. NOT WORTH the savings"
5,Canon Print Cartridge Review,Not much to really say. It costs me $10 less than Staples and arrived in a few days (with free shipping too). I'm a happy camper.
5,Great Price,Best deal on the web. This is the second time I've purchased these ink tanks and will come here again when needed.
3,Canon MP830 printer magenta ink,"My husband insisted on the Canon printer because it's supposed to print better quality photos. What we didn't know was that we had to get Canon photo paper; it will not print correctly on Kodak or other photo papers. That aside, the printer ink colors are OK, but the printer goes through more ink than any HP printer I've ever owned. The ink is fine, the printer just seems to run out too quickly, particularly the cyan and magenta colors. My next printer will be another HP printer."
1,Wrong Ink Cartridges!!!,I just wasted money On these ink cartridges because amazon incorrectlystated they would work on my MP620 Printer. They Dont!!! You will need theCLI 221 series of ink cartridges which Amazon Incorrectly indentifies as non-compatible.How on earth does amazon not catch these mistakes is beyond me.I lost $40 because I already opened and try to use ink cartridge whichdid not fit. Thanks Alot Amazon!!!
2,afraid to buy non oem,Shortly after I decided to fill my own ink tanks my last printer died. Now I'm afraid to buy anything but oem ink tanks and so I'm paying through the nose - Amazon has the best prices though...
4,"Great item, but doesn't last long enough","If I would have know how much the cartridges cost and how much they last, I probably would not have brought this printer. The cartridges are excellent quality but it seems that the printer sucks up these cartridges like a sponge. If you do plenty of printing, its best to have plenty of spares on hand since you don't want to get stuck without ink.I have found Amazon and Circuit City have the best prices on this ink."
5,Satisfaction,"Lasts a very long time before running low. Color reproduction is excellent. Holds color on universal paper, without fading, for a very long time. Cost of ink per page very competitive.Canon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink Tanks"
1,watch out the defected product,"I bought this product several times. The last one I bought have the defect itself (the snap part of the ink tack is not gone somehow). since it past one month free return period,I have to pay 50% for return/exchange. So my advise here is to watch out and try to test it in one month. It could have defects."
3,Problem with black ink,"I bought this product to replace the ink tanks on my Cannon 520 printer. All of the tanks were correct size except the black tank which did not fit. I had to go to Staples to buy the correct size black tank which cost me $18. in addition to what I paid for the CLI-8 multipack. I don't know If Amazon would have given me credit for the black tank I could not use, because the packaging was destroyed when I opened the tank. No way to open it without tearing the packaging,then you discover the wrong size too late."
3,Wrong information on Ink,"Your web site stated that the number 8blk ink would fit my Cannon printer the colors fit the black does not.The ink had to be purchased locally to keep me in business. I want to return it for a exchange, I have already opened the black and am going to need the colors soon. What can you do to help me in an expedited manner?"
3,Okay product.,Purchased these for a decent price but did not last long. Received them within two weeks. Purchased aftermarket cartridges and am very satisfied and cheaper than the Cannon products.
1,This package requires review. It is not recommended for the CANON PIXMA MX700 printer,"This package did not meet my expectations.Your answer to the question; would this work with my Canon PIXMA MX700 printer was ""yes"". Unfortunately the CLI 8BK does not work with this printer. The package should include the CANON PGI 5BK instead. I had to purchase a PGI 5 BK cartridge locally. Ihave to dispose of the CLI 8BK in the trash."
5,Great Value for the Price,"Although it was not listed, I found after reading another review, that these cartridges would fit my Cannon MP530.They work great and the price made it great buy."
3,necessary,"Required by my printer. It is good ink, but expensive. I am Leary about generic inks, so I have not tried them."
5,printer makers make great ink,The ink arrived just as expected and of course the quality is top notch. I have made the mistake of trying to fill my own cartridges. It is best to pay a little extra and get the best.
3,Canon printer always had stripes in solid areas.,"Very good color reproduction, but the printer always printed stripes in large solid areas. No adjustments seemed to get rid of this problem. Printer cartridges lasted an average amount of time. Using third party cartridges to save money ruined the printer. Cost of cartridges far exceeds the the cost of the printer. Use good quality ink-jet paper for best quality results."
1,"wrong product, unuseable","completely wrong product sent; need to return, but do not know how to manage the hassle; money refund would be nice, product will end up in the garbage"
4,Canon 8PM,"As always, very expensive, but much cheaper than local office supply stores and ordered in quantity you even ge free shipping. Canon inks are the best and I warn you against ever trying the cheaper ""compatible"" inks...they are total crap."
2,Ink cartridge errors constantly,"My yellow cartridge is constantly erroring, and I have to remove it and reinsert it almost every time I print now. One other new cartridge did the same thing a couple times too. The yellow one is basically unusable and it's not returnable because I did not use it right away and 30 days has come and gone long ago. The only fix I've found for this on the internet is to remove the computer chip and replace it with an old one. Luckily, I was slow to recycle it and still have it."
3,Not a good value,"One of the real benefits of buying a printer like the Canon MP830 is that you can purchase individual color ink cartridges. I bought this pack because it seemed good at first, but found that you use up certain colors - especially the black and red (usually) - more often than the others. If you buy this box too many times, you'll end up stuck with left over cartridges of one or more colors. Great ink - just not a good support of the whole point of the printer."
4,It's ink,"What else can you say about it? It's the stuff you use for the pro9000 and I use it. This price is decent but, of course, you know that you're not going to use these 8 colors equally. A nice starter buy but I prefer to go to Atlex to purchase my inks. I only use OEM and I've found their prices to be the best around.If you're in need of all 8 colors then this deal is good - especially because of the free and fast shipping."
3,Amazon claims this works with the MX700,"Amazon claims this works with the MX700. The color inks do, but not the black. Be aware that if you buy for the MX700, you need to throw away the black (you need a CLI-5, not the CLI-8 included)."
4,A comment on Canon Ink replacement,"Before you install new ink cartridges, let the old ones completely run out, let the software indicator turn red. Otherwise Canon's software will not recognize that the tanks have been replaced and will continue to indicate your out of ink."
5,Animated X-Files,"If you are like me and miss ""X-Files"", you will love this. The animation is terrific. The characters are memorable. Lots of good action. One of the series that got me to start liking anime. What's not to like?"
4,Slow start of no consiqence,"Despite starting more slowly than the other Tunis novels I've read, the book quickly makes up for lost time Spike and Bob Russell are slick-feilding brothers who come to a Dodger team whose manager fails to inspire. Spike is apointed manager and success increases. But when Babe Stansworth, the Brooklyn catcher is injured, it falls to Jocko Klein, a young Jew, to fill in. In a world of religous bigotry Jocko cracks, making his teamates and opponents alike belive all the more that ""Jews are yellow""-that he can't take it. It falls on Spike to stop this horrible stream of verbal (and physical-pitchers throw beanballs to him) attacks and make the team WORK as a team."
3,Assessing Financial Vulnerability: An Early Warning System,"Save the money! To get a clue on the subject go to the IMF site and download the variety of Kaminsky's and friends papers available. You must go to the references in there, Eichengreen and his friends for instance."
5,Looking into her soul,"This is a heartbreaking beautiful CD, particularly in light of Susannah's suicide on May 19, 2001. First released in 1983, this CD is an example of what caberet is at its best; a succession of tunes by composers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Blossom Dearie and Oscar Brown Jr., each song a separate part of a integral theme: the romantic trials of a now-single woman in an urban setting. The genre is not new but there will never be another Susannah McCorkle. These songs will be easier to listen to for me, after the shock of her death has passed. ""The Hungry Years"" by Neil Sedaka/Howard Greenfield is an excellent example of the perfect emotive qualities of her voice and timing, or try ""The Lady's In Love With You"" (Frank Loesser/Burton Lane). If you are hearing this CD for the first time, I can pretty much guarantee it will go straight to your heart. Not a bad cut among the bunch."
5,A great singer,"I've had this album for years and have played it countless times. The song which first caught my attention, and which I rate as near the top for a performance by any female jazz singer is ""Bye Bye Country Boy"". It shows Susannah at her best--wistful, brimming with emotion, feeling the pain of life's lost chances, but never overstated. On the contrary, it is moving in a quiet and deeply memorable way."
5,Beier gives a top-rank performance.,"This is the second of Beier's two volumes of Bach, and it maintains the fine quality of Volume One. If you want highly decorative, unorthodox versions of these works, Lislevand might be your man. If you prefer straightforward accounts with little embellishment, then Lindberg might be ideal. But if you prefer something right in the middle, Beier's discs are top candidates for your cash. The nearest I've heard to performances like these are Hopkinson Smith's, but Beier isn't recorded quite as close. The result is very positive, clean and purposeful with very nice, tasteful embellishments that seem totally appropriate.Beier's Milano disc first made me aware of what a top class lutenist he is. Now I've heard these excellent CDs, I've no hesitation in ranking him with the very best around.The recording quality itself is also extremely good."
3,"good wine glasses, but...","Very lightweight - almost too much so. The stems are nice and thin, but the wine glasses themselves are extremely fragile. I suspect they will not last. Even with just hand washing.One of mine broke in transit (poor packing!!! you shouldn't rely on a simple cardboard box with no padding to protect glass!!!), and Amazon/Target were nice enough to refund the full price (incl. shipping) and not require a return, so I ordered another set. Hopefully the next one will arrive unscathed."
2,Book,This is outdated and I am sure there are more useful and current books for the topic of children with disabilities. Is nice because it goes through the process of helping the child through birth to three or your local school district.
3,nice but not the best on the subject,I would recommend Christopher Wood's book Fairies in Victorian Art over this. It's not a bad thing to have this book as well though. If you had to pick one between the two books that exist on this subject then Christopher Wood has written the better book in my opinion. This is a catalog to an exhibition more than a strict book on the subject.
4,Okay,I thought this book would be like a invite to fairy land. but i was very disapointed. dont botherbuying this book.
4,Captures a variety of perspectives on the Middle East,"I picked up this book, thinking it would be a political analysis of the Middle East. Instead, I was surprised to find that while it covered this angle admirably, it was in actuality a travel book summarizing Selby's tour of the Holy Land on her bicycle. The stories she tells of her journey really bring home the scale of human suffering caused by the conflict between Israel and its neighbours. The stories surrounding her travels through the settlement camps in the occupied territories are particularly moving. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Middle East, peace and conflict studies, or for those who enjoy their travel books written with a strong dose of reality by a razor-sharp wit."
2,Buxton Heiress Collection Black Leather Cigarette case,I smoke 100's and these are NOT made for them. I can get my cigarettes in it but it wont close. I was very disappointed.
1,inexpensive case,"cheap and cheesy, but i guess i could have expected that for the price, wont purchase another without seeing first"
3,Boring Haydn.,Why chose these symphonies to record? Fairly well played with good sound quality but who cares - not his best work.
3,I will happily pay more for a shoe that doesn't fall apart...,"I find myself aquiring a third pair of 10 EE in a year. Up until now we have outgrown soccer shoes, but never worn them out. My 16 year old has hit six foot tall and has wide feet. The growing seems to have stopped and we should be having shoes last. Instead they are falling apart midseason and we limp along with them simply getting a new pair for the following season. For anything else I would not again repurchase something of such low quality. Unfortunately I cannot find any other soccer shoe that comes close to fitting. 9.5 EEE in a better made shoe would be ideal. (Insert Irish sigh here.)"
3,Great camera except for flash speed,"This is a very nice camera, except for one fatal flaw. The flash takes forever to charge. Unless you keep the flash ""topped off"" (e.g. by periodically turning on the camera, which fills the capacitor) you will never be able to take a spur-of-the-moment picture with a flash."
4,Pretty nice,"I needed a tiny camera and this one fit the bill. I love that I can put it in a jeans pocket. I am pretty wary of throwing it in a backpack, though. It seems somehow fragile, and I'm trying not to break it. Battery life is unbelieveable. Pictures on the whole, are nice and able to be improved if necssary with basic software. There are lots of fun features, but I can't say they are all intuitive. It does take some work to get through the manual. I've had it a couple of months now, and am still learning. All in all, I'm glad I bought this camera. I use it several days a week."
1,Torts in Epstein Land,"Epstein consistently fails to distinguish between the law as applied by real courts and the law as Epstein would like it to be. On the rare occassion that he does acknowledge that his views are not law, he refuses to present the arguments in favor of the majority rule fairly or objectively, often characterizing a court's allegedly faulty application of a rule as a mistake, or worse. The vast majority of Epstein's views in any area of law, including the law of torts, are way out on the fringe of American jurisprudence, and he does the reader a disservice by pretending otherwise."
5,Extraordinary Casebook,"Richard Epstein's Cases and Materials on Torts is easily the best casebook I used in law school. The cases are well edited, and the prose clear and tight. The notes after and before the cases are clear and thought provoking, but more importantly, let the reader know why the cases have been included in the book. While the book is heavily slanted toward a law and economics approach to tort law, I recommend this book for any professor who wants a systematic and clear approach to tort law that students will appreciate"
2,utv rhino seat covers,The seat covers were fine but the head rest covers do not fit properly and do not have straps to hold them on. Thank You.
3,Not Racing in the Rain,"Like other reviewers, I read Racing first and loved the author's voice (well coming out a a dog's mouth, but you get the drift). This work has a similar voice, which I liked, but the story is disjointed and sort of lurched from place to place. Can't say I would recommend it, but it's not terrible either."
2,How Evan Broke his head,"Not a bad book, just not as interesting and readable as his last book ""The art of driving in the rain"""
2,Not the quality I expected,"After reading Stein's fabulous ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" I was anxious to read other offerings by this author. This was terribly disappointing. There is a juvenile tone to the entire work. Perhaps Stein should stick to the dog voice!"
4,Really enjoyed,"It may seem a little sad at times, but it's really not. I like that it's a story that could belong to someone. I love a good novel and for me this qualified!"
5,Garth Stein rocks,"I started with The Art of Racing in the Rain.....amazing book!!! Then I read Raven Stole the Moon, another amazing book! So I'm a dedicated Stein fan by the end of that one so I ordered Evan as soon as i finished it. You know when you're so excited about an author and yu build the book up so much then it's JUST what you expected and more....that's how I felt about Evan. This book rocks!"
4,yes...they're ugly.,"i try to overlook the fact that these are soooo ugly....because they're sooo comfortable. for excessive amounts of walking during the summer, i highly recommend them. nothing compares to crocs, short of going barefoot."
2,explaination below,"we like the correct product, the person that was shopped for ,not me ,had bought a pair of size 8 , it fiited her great , so her daughter , via amazon, bought her another pair, , same number , they did not fit her ,Then i ordered anothef pair , one size bigger, the one i returned, well, in the one ,( I compared it to the old one she is still using) the strap is shorterf, they dont fitWhen we checked the crocs we found that the old one she is still using is made in Mexico , the other two are made in China, It looks like the Chinese are using a different patttern,, and knowing from experience , the Chinese have smaller feet than Us , I can see the problem, CAN YOU CORRECTED IT FOR AMERICAN SHOPPERS ? and if you are going to answer this message, can you tell us the difference between the womens us/mens us and only womens sizes we see when we order shoes or crocs?Thank you"
5,Old Standard Still Popular,What can I say about Crocs. I bought these as a gift because they were on his Christmas and he loves them. I bought them at Amazon because I had trouble finding them and I always can count on Amazon.
2,Way to big!,Ordered my standard size but these kind of shoes are not made for slender feet. I felt like I was clomping everywhere.
2,took too long,didnt know this item was coming from amsterdam germany. Next time im checking the seller profile before buying. Not the color I expected. The blue they had posted looked more like a baby blue the ones we go were like denim blue. Not a fan of the color.
1,Sizing was WAY off,The shoe itself seemed to be nice but was about 2 sizes smaller than my crocs I bought before in the exact same style. They were so small I couldn't even get them on but were marked the same size as the ones I have now. Had to return them and don't really want the hassle of trying another pair without knowing if they will fit right.
5,Crocs for Christmas,"My 25 year old had mentioned when he tried on his dad's crocs several months ago, how much he liked them. He was totally surprised to get his own pair for Christmas, and just loves them! Not sure though what his girlfriend will think......"
5,Wide for my foot.,"I have a narrow foot, so these are a little wide. I wear them around the pool, so they work great for that. White is bright, but blends with everything. They are comfortable."
4,Beautifully ugly,The perfect shoe for walking around the house. Spongy and soft. The first steps are painful for me in the morning and these things take the pain away. The only negative is that the tread on the bottoms wear out a little too fast and when slick are dangerous on a wet walkway or driveway.
4,Beware of sizing,"These are perfect except that they are much bigger than I thought. I'm using them at the pool/gym so the bigger size is OK. But if you are looking to get these to wear out and about I would order down a size. After I got them I read that yes, this is the way they should fit - meant to be large. They seem to be just what I needed and have a nice thick sole that seems to hold up well on the slippery steam room, pool, or shower floor. Recommended for comfort too. But let's face, these are not pretty shoes. In my case I am willing to give up a bit on the style side as I was strictly looking for function."
3,too large for size specified,"they fit slightly loose compared to the same size I have in a different color; other than that, they are made very sturdy"
4,Crocs review,Make a nice easy on shoes for going outside in a hurry. They are not comfortable to me for long distance walking.
4,Great crocs!,"Great crocs, though the sizing seems to have changed over the years; this pair is a bit smaller than the same size pair I have from a few years ago. They are such versatile, comfortable, easily cleanable shoes!"
4,Sperry,"This is the second pair of these Sperrys and this pair is improved over the prior pair, if that is possible. They are a great casual shoe both in looks and comfort."
3,no longer Made in USA - Made in China!,"The cayman i received fits fine and works fine. The details of the moldings, however, were noticeably less defined than the ones i bought last year. Upon closer examination, i noticed that the words MADE IN USA imprinted on the underside of the crocs on last year's model were replaced with MADE IN CHINA on this year's model. Perhaps THAT explains the lacking quality difference? Again it still works fine, but SORRY! I'm not paying $30 for crocs MADE IN CHINA that look like the cheaper chinese-made knock-offs! For those, the only things lacking are the cute little croc buttons on the sides. I'll buy other brands (albeit made in china) for a lot less."
2,comfortable but really ugly,"I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might. In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these. I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable. I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor. The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them."
5,Great Shoes!!!!,Excellent shoes! this is my second pair and they are the best shoes for the shower. They are great for just walking around the house or out in the street. I will continue to buy other styles.
5,Great shoes,Crocs are some of the most comfortable casual shoes I've ever owned. This is my second pair. I am still using the first pair for around the yard. The shoes come in different styles and color and seem to be indestructible.
5,My second pair!,I bought an exact duplicate of the crocks I had worn out. They are wonderful to walk in. The only problem I had was the soles of my feet got very dry if I wore them without socks for any length of time.
5,Like walking on air!,"The crocs clogs are the best investment I've made yet for my feet. I am disabled with arthritis in the knees and these shoes make it so much easier to walk! My crocs are so comfortable, I forget they are on my feet."
3,Size are not always correct,"This is the second pair we ordered. The first pair came quickly and was a true womens 8m. We ordered a second pair, a women's 9m, it has that size on the shoe but it is the same size as the first pair we ordered, which was very disappointing"
1,What the heck with Sizing?,Every seller has their own sizing chart for these things. It's not consistent and it makes it impossible to order them. I give up and I'm not going to bother to buy them. No wonder Crocs is bankrupt!
1,what a Croc!,I ordered my daughter the orange Crocs for her birthday. They arrived in two days in time for her to open for her big day. They broke within an hour of wearing. I am so disappointed. I have to find out how and if I can return them. What a hassle!
1,Horrible return policy,"I ordered these crocs over the summer for my day camp job. But what I did not know was that they run big. I got a size 7 in this color and a size 6 in the purple. I only used the purple ones during the summer. The other day I was cleaning out my closet and found this khaki crocs, and I no longer want them. When I tried at least returning or getting Amazon credit I was told no because the deadline date had passed. But I don't get if it is in it's original packaging. HORRIBLE!!!!!! Will never order shoes from this site!"
4,"""They're alright.""","I bought these for my mother to replace some cheaper versions that she has had for years. She likes them but still wears her old noname ones quite a bit. The price difference makes them a ""good"" pair that she doesn't wanna get dirty yet."
1,rubber chafes my ankles,"I wore these for one day only. The rubber chafed against my ankles until my skin was rubbed off. So, don't wear these without socks. In addition, they just weren't very comfortable at all. It felt like I had a bunch of hard rubber nipples pressed against my foot (and that's pretty much what it was). I guess if you want shoes that you can spray off with the garden hose, then these will work for you. But, if you want something more comfy, try Teva, or Keen."
1,wrong size,"I ordered 2 pairs of shoes, both from the same page, which was sorted by size.The order came, both pairs of different size, and Amazon says I ordered them that way.Never again."
5,"Great ""sandals""","Very comfortable shoes. I use them around the house as an alternative to flip-flops or sandals. Easy to clean and breathable. Delivered faster than expected, which seems to be a hallmark of Amazon."
4,Super comfortable!!,"These shoes are the most comfortable thing you'll put on your feet. They are very casual--not a problem if you're on vacation, but very clunky if you're doing business casual."
4,Extremely comfortable,They do seem too wide but I suppose that is because these shoes are made to fit both men and women. Even with the wideness of the shoe it doesn't seem to affect the comfort level. Good support and quite comfortable.
4,Keep Crocs out of the sun,The new crocs I ordered for my husband came on time and in the perfect size. They are replacements for the ones he left in the sun for a couple of days. They shrank about one size. He thought at first that his feet were swelling.
3,"This are made in Mexico, they're not good like the made in Italy. I wish I knew this before....","I purchased one pair for my mum a few months ago, those were made in Italy and they're great! So I ordered a econd pair, just got them and they're made in Mexico and are like the Italy ones, this are mush smales (even they're the same size) and les wider. Wish I had know this before and I would have not purchased them......"
4,A Comfortable Gift,This was a gift for my mother who has been looking for another pair of comfortable crocs. She picked the raspberry color and says she loves them.
3,they are a little big,"Received them on time, just a little big, thought they would fit like my other pair that are an XL- 10-11 men. I ordered 11 men, should've went 10 men, oh well, they will still work for what i'm using them for."
4,Great gift,"I bought the Crocs as a present for my Dad. He loves them. He wears them all the time. They are so comfortable. He was skeptical at first, but he remarks how great these shoes make his feet feel. He wears them everywher, to drive, relax around the house, etc."
5,On time and as ordered,Smooth purchase. Have bought many pair of Crocs over the years and this purchase was speedy and as ordered.
5,I love crocs!,"I own 5 pairs of crocs in different colors and models, they are fantastic for casual wear. My favorite model is the classic. I just flip the heel strap forward and wear them as clogs. they are soft and squishy and helps alot with heel pain as I usually stand for 8-10 hours a day at work. Love em!"
4,Excelent shoes,Mi son is very happy because this shoes is confortables and have a very nice look. Excelent product. This review.
1,Seller never came through with the item.,"I have had Sperry Top siders before and loved them. When this item was on sale as a close out item I was happy to see it available in my size. After waiting for a month or more, I finally got a E mail saying they had cancelled my order, because the supply had not arrived, and invited me to contact them directly, not through Amazon, to re submitt the order.I thought it was strange that a close out item would be on back order, and the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth, so I just declined to pursue the item."
1,WRONG SIZE AND COLOR,"The item received was the wrong color and most importantly the WRONG SIZE, cost more to return from a deployment than it worth............:("
1,wrong sizing,Crocs are marked M10 / W12.. Since when are women's sizes LARGER than men's. Had to return them since I was looking for an actual men's 10.. These were way too large.Amazon said it was my mistake for orering the wrong size. Ha.
2,Crocs had a shrinking problem from sunlight.,"My size 12 crocks began to shrink, apparently from exposure to sunlight or the heat of the sun. Within 3 weeks I could no longer get the right one on and it was visibly smaller than the left. I believe it had gone down more than one size. Amazon did a great job of providing a means for returning them!! I have 2 other pair of Crocs that never had this problem."
4,these run large,"These crocs are great and comfortable, as all crocs are - but a warning to other buyers that this particular style runs very large. I bought two Crocs as a gift for a friend, in his regular size. The other pair fit perfectly, but these ones were huge for him. I think it is because it is also a wide fit. I had to return them and exchange for a full size smaller, which work fine on him. So just be cautious as to the size you order in these ones - I would recommend going a size smaller than your regular size."
4,Nice Crocs,"I work in the offshore industry and these are perfect for when I need to go to the mess hall or showers etc. For anyone who works offshore, they're sure to understand what I mean. The quality is good, the price is great and it feels quite good on my feet."
5,wonderful shoes,"I have had many Sperry deck shoes over the years, these are very attractive and very comfortable. They appear to be very well made. sizing was just as I expected. Order delivery was prompt. You will love these shoes for all occasions."
5,Perfect!,"I was looking for a shoe which would cushion the toes of my arthritic feet. I thought I'd try Crocs, and am so glad I did! I love them. My husband saw how great they were and ordered a pair for himself. We wear them all the time."
5,Original is best,"This croc pair is very similar to the original croc pair I have since worn out. They fit true to size on my feet just like the original- not too big, not too small- Just right!"
3,"Good, but watch the color","The shoe product is very nice and comfortable on my feet. I was able to get a 13W, which is not easy in many styles. However, the ""oak"" color description is not accurate. The color shipped to me was not as seen in the description, it was much lighter. I still liked the shoe but I rated it a 3 due to the color discrepancy."
3,Sizing a problem,"Ordered for my husband for Fathers Day. His normal shoe size is 10 1/2. So I ordered size 11. Way too large. Then re-ordered size 10, STILL way too large. Hopefully size 9 will fit. A full size and a half smaller than normal shoe size! I also ordered a pair for myself. My normal size is 8. So of course I order size 8, way too big too. Re-ordered size 7. These did fit."
1,Sizing woefully wrong,The Crocs came packaged appropriately and in due time. The size was way off and was 2 sizes smaller than what is said on the bottom of the shoe as well as on the tag. They said made in China. I bought them for my husband to replace the same pair he owned-same style and size and color but his old pair said made in Canada. So buyer beware.
1,Horrible!!,"I've been looking for a PINK pair of crocs for a while. I found these and ordered a size women's 8. When they came I was so excited except they sent a men's size 8 which ends up being a women's size 10 so they were HUGE. Also, the pink they show is not the correct color, in person it's more of a coral pink than a ""hot"" pink as indicated. BUMMER!"
3,Too big if you wear a men's size 9,"They were true to product adverstised. However, if your hubby wears a men's nine, they will be a little bit big, since they come in double sizes (9/10)."
5,buen producto,"las especificaciones descritas en la pagina del producto se ajusta con el fisico del mismo, por lo que este cubre las espectativas."
3,a bit more clunky,"these are arguably the greatest invention since the bedroom slipper and flip flop... however, how far can we go with injection molding? this version is VERY large and clunky.. the airwalk version is much more slip and less cumbersome. i could even fit these into my overnight bag..."
4,Crocs Classic Clog,"Runs a little big for me, my feet length is 27 cms and this 11 clogs are really spacious. But with cushion crew socks feels good."
5,Great work shoe,My daughter is a CNA and she loved getting these shoes for work. They were true to size and color. She is very happy with this purchase and they were delivered on time.
1,Wrong size!,"I ordered a size 11 and got a size 13 - In Afghanistan, so it's not like I can just return them.... booo - clown shoes"
1,too big,"Do not order shoes from Amazon unless you know your size for that brand of shoe. I order a pair of crocs Yukon Clog the same size as my running shoe which has worked for me in the pass for other brand name shoes. But these crocs were just too big, it cost me 8 bucks to fine out."
4,Crocs,"Perfect shoe to slip on for a trip outside, yard work, etc... Easy to clean and care for. We leave ours by the back door."
4,"Great price, great product","Other than the color being just a bit lighter than I perceived these are really good shoes, work well with my scrubs, and keep my feet happy with me after 12-13 hours."
5,Review of Crocs Cayman sandals,Item arrived well within the specified time and in good condition. Excellent service. Thank you.
4,"Great, But....",The item ship fast but the only problem was that i order one black crocs and i recieved one pair brown..but it did not matter i like it anyway...
4,"Great overall, but soles wore through fast","My husband wanted Crocs for house and outdoor casual use. He loved the fit and ease and waterproof qualities of his Crocs, but we were were surprised when the soles wore through in 6 months. We expected longer better wear of a ""beach shoe."" But still Crocs are Crocs: we ordered another pair."
4,Buy one size bigger!,"I normally use size 9(Women) but in this case wears too tight, I mean, no cramped but tight to be a crocs. I recommend to buy one size bigger.The color is as bright as the picture (I love it) and the delivery on time."
3,Crocs,My crocs r great but when I first received them in the mail I pulled them out of the box and the tops and back foot bands were all crunched up and was kind of uncomfortable but after about a month wearing them here and there. They went back to there original shape. So all worked out and they fit great
3,Comfortable but hot weather can cause blisters.,"I attend a water aerobics class and noticed that a few of the women wore the croc shoes. I liked the kick around idea and knew there would be no harm when wearing them around so much water. I got them and was pretty happy until one day in the summer I took a mile long walk at the school near me. About half way through the mile I noticed a burning on the top of my foot. When I got home I took a closer look and seen that I had a pretty red welp and could not wear the shoes for about a week. There was a burn mark for a couple of months after the walk. They are fine with socks in the winter, but for summer wear I suggest if you are going to be doing a lot of walking I wouldn't wear the crocs."
3,Not as good as they used to be,"This is my third pair of the original style crocks, but obviously the mold these are made from is a new one, because these don't fit as well as my others do. They are almost too large, especially in the width of the heal and the length of the strap. My foot will barely stay in these if I rely on the strap. I quickly compared these to my older pairs to verify I'd ordered the same style and size. They are all made in Mexico and were the same size and style, but there were several differences in mold marks that made it clear these were made from a different mold. If I had ordered these to serve as anything other than a pair of house shoes, I'd return them. There's no way I could wear these all day and feel comfortable."
5,Classic practical shoe,"Yes they look like hooves, but what other shoe goes from fishing to boating to beach to camping without missing a beat."
1,Crocs,Poor - The strap broke after only 1 week. I guess I know why they were cheap with free shipping.
2,Sizing Error,"The crock in the size men's 12 M, in the color white, is wide and long. Perhaps this is not true in the other colors, but the white is sloppy big on my husband's long narrow foot."
4,"Crocs Classic Clog,Cotton Candy,Women's 7 M US/Men's 5 M US","This year I bought 6 pairs of Crocks, love them all exeps this shining material of these Crocs Classic Clog,Cotton Candy,Women's. But I am happy because my gran child always ask me to wear these."
3,Runs larger than the same size in the mall,"First I love these shoes and have several pairs. But these particular ones seem to be about a half size larger than the ones I bought at the Croc's booth in the local mall, thought the size printed on the bottom of them is the same. They also just feel a bit wide. I will probably not send them back but give them to my husband."
5,Comfy,These are nice. They are a little wide on my foot but I have an exceptionally narrow foot. They never slipped off or anything though. Little bumps on the footbed are very cushioning. I really like them.
4,My sweaty feet love them,These fit better than any shoe I've ever had and they allow my feet to breathe! I love wearing these on the beach. Four stars.
3,Look fine but something wrong,"I got these for my son when his old ones broke. They look fine, same as the previous one. But at the rivet that keeps the strap in place they rub against his feet and now he has 4 blisters. I don't think they are real crocs because they have never done that and he's been wearing crocs for 6 years."
2,Damaged prior to shipping,"I am very dissatified with this product, as well as the vendor (I believe it was ShoeMall). The plastic rivet that holds the strap on was missing when it arrived. The strap was extended straight out and flopping around. The rivet was not in the box either, so it was in that condition when shipped.Then, making it even worse, ShoeMall did not refund my shipping fees! I can understand not refunding fees if I changed my mind or didn't ""like"" them. However, sending out a obviously defective item, that should not have been shipped to me in the first place is HORRIBLE customer service. I had even written on the return slip that I expected a refund.This is the second time ShoeMall has done this to me and I will NEVER order from them again."
5,Crocs are great,"I was always critical of crocs because, in my opinon, they are some pretty ugly footwear, but I thought I would give them a try. Being in Afghanistan and having to use public showers, you really dont want footwear that is going to fall apart on you. These things not only do the job when it comes to showering, but they are just extremely comfortable. Waking on gravel back and forth from the tent to the showers, you cant even feels the rocks under your feet. As assumed, they breathe really well and just good shoes to wear around and kick back in. The only thing is that they ran rather big and I had to send the first order back. I wear an 11.5 and a 12 was absolutely gigantic. I ordered a pair in 11 from another site later on and they were perfect. yes, they might not be the most visually appealing shoe on the planet, but they are amazingly comfortable and durable."
3,Smaller than they used to be!,"My family has worn Crocs for years and loves them! My husband has worn out his old pair, so we ordered a new pair in exactly the same size. But the ones that came in were a full one inch shorter than his old ones even though they are labelled exactly the same size. Obviously they've changed their outsourcing and a mens 10 in Mexico differs from a men's 10 in China and a men's 10 in Canada or USA."
3,"Good, Not overwhelming","I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable. I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor. The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them, and I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might. In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these."
5,Best shoe I've ever worn,"Since hitting middle age, my feet have given me trouble...have been to podiatrists, etc. I tried Berkenstocks and they were okay, but the Crocs have been my life saver. Maybe not gorgeous to look at, but I can walk and walk and WALK in them and not have any problems. I've tried a lot of other highly recommended shoes, but these are by far the best. I love the pink, navy, and khaki...and I do find the Cayman's/Classics to be the best of all styles for comfort."
5,Son Liked,"Bought these for our older son who goes through sandals quickly. He liked this style, its comfort and its hardiness."
4,"Nice Boat Shoe, but Wish They Didn't Change the Oak Color and Had Laces That Matched the Shoe Color","This is about the only reasonably priced boat shoe that will match tan Dockers. I preferred the old Oak color to the new version, but these will do. I also, wish Sperry would make their laces oak to match the shoe color. Overall a nice shoe that would be perfect if they tweaked it slightly as I said."
3,It's okay,"Bought it only for the brand. I have used more comfortable slip-ons. Also the color of the product which actually arrived is a bit different, a bit darker and duller than what you see in the picture."
4,I made the mistake or ordering the wrong size,I contacted the company and returned them and was given full credit back in two days. Overall would use them again.
2,Crocs went from good to bad. Not the product it once was.,"Shoe is now a harder material. Not cushy like the original Crocs. Also foot bed has huge nubs that hurt the soles of my foot. 2 pair, navy and black are being sent back. Sad that the company tweaked their shoe, but went the wrong way."
5,"crocs Classic Clog,Black,Men's 9 M/Women's 11 M","crocs Classic Clog,Black,Men's 9 M/Women's 11 M; I never thought I would see the day I would by crocs! I think it might be middle age, and my back injury, lol. They are decently comfortable and easy to slip on and off.They also clean easily in the sinkThe sizes are near exact so if you wear a half size, like 10 1/2, order an 11."
2,Sizing Has Changed,"I purchased the exact same style and size as my last pair of crocs and this pair was significantly smaller. Unfortunately I had taken all the tags etc off before I went to wear them the first time. Before I even put them on I noticed they looked smaller, so I checked the size, which was right according to my old pair but they were significantly smaller. Now I have a pair of Crocs I can't wear. Definitely try them on before you detag them to make sure they will fit the way you are expecting."
4,Great Shower Shoes,The crocs are fine the only thing is I ordered them in black and when they got here they were brown.
5,It's a crock!,This is a wonderful color and the wearer is thrilled with its color and comfort. A lower price would have been nice but that's the law of supply and demand at work.
3,broken strap on shoe,Received the size 9 croc sandal but my toes hit the op of the shoe uncomfortably. Obvious no half sizes. The right shoe strap on the inside is not connectred well and keeps falling off. I will not buy another pair. Beverly Covington
5,"comfort, not style","I love Crocs and buy new pairs every year because once the bottom ridges smooth out, there is a slipping risk. I have wide feet, so Crocs give me toe room and cool the feet in summer heat."
3,Didn't fit well,"The original size ordered fit in length, but was just too wide to be wearable. These were returned due to fit. I was trying them as a woman. They may fit a man's wider foot better."
5,great price,"thanks for the offer, I really like these crocs. come on! why do i have to do this? enough already!"
2,Not for me,"Not a good fit for my feet, which are long and thin; my toes scrubbed against the front of the shoe, so I had to send them back :("
1,Very Disappointed,"I wear a size 8.5 to 9.0 men's shoe. I read the reviews on here and people said to round down,so I did. I ordered a size 8 croc. The shoe arrived on time,actually early. But! Rounding down one size was incorrect,these shoes are HUGE. My son wears a size 10 and they fit ok on him. I received them today and they are being returned today. Even with socks they are so big they will not stay on my foot. That includes using the strap,they are just to big. I have no idea who measures the size of these things but they really need to learn how to read and measure. They are way off. Now to top it off I am being charged to return these."
1,what happen to crocs,"Recently I purchased a new pair of crocs as I need a choco color. I have had a pair for several years. I sent the new pair back as they were uncomfortable, stiff and hard. What happen to the soft rubber soles that soften each step. I wish products that were good to excellent would not use lower quality material that changes the comfort level they once had. I will not purchase crocs in the future. There is a huge difference. My four dollar off brand for gardening felt more comfortable than those new shoes."
2,Inconsistent shoe sizes,"I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7. However, when they arrived, while the Thongs fit perfectly, with room to wiggle, the Caymans were way too small (I'd almost say a full size too small). The Thongs were ""made in China"" and the Caymans ""made in Mexico"". I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries. It would appear to me that there is no ""standard"" mold used. So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size, depending on where they are manufactured."
5,They're THAT Comfortable!,"I have trouble wearing just about any shoe, and have spent a sizeable amount of money with Keens, Dansko's, Birks, you name it. These shoes are the answer to my prayers. They are light as a feather, fun and have a wide toebox and good arch support. Just bought them for my 65 year old mother and she hasn't taken them off. I wish everyone would wear these all the time so I could get away with wearing them for more formal occcasions like business meetings.They're kind of funny looking so I intentionally buy them in outrageous colors so they're even more obvious! Yu can wear them with the strap forward like a clog or around the back of your heel. You can wear them with or without socks. You can wash them too. You will love these."
1,Serious sizing problems,"These shoes are at least one size larger than the ""normal"" size should be. I had to return my order and pay shipping. After reading the other reviews, I found that my problem is obviously not unique. Since there is no way to try out these shoes in local stores and buy the same size at Amazon (sizing inconsistent, depending on origins of manufacturers), I would NOT advise anyone buying them online."
4,gives me great arch support,I bought these for the advertised arch support and they do that for me. The strap however is a pain and I removed them... These are a bit over priced or I would get a 2nd pair..
4,Cross Sandals,"The shipping was on time, and the product was what i expected but on of the four pairs of shoes was not right on the size, the fuchsia shoes came 8 Women's"
5,"What a ""croc""!!!",Everything is fine with my recent purchase of a pair of crocs......I bought these for one of my daughters.....She is very happy with them...
4,Quality and affordable,"A great alternative to flip flops without spending a ton of money. Try them, chances are you'll like 'em."
5,Excellent producto,"I have bought other Crocs through Amazon before. Again, this purchasing experience was excellent. No problems with size, color or delivery time."
5,lined crocs great,"Size 14 lined crocs were great! just as advertised! would recommend! Fit as expected, looked as shown in clip. Would encourage others needing a large men's size to try this product!"
5,Classic Crocs,These were purchased as a gift. They came right out of the box and onto the feet. Color and fit were perfect. No complaints.
4,Very good,"This product is great a good shoe for my father that he is a little fat, but the bad thing is that box was too big for shoes"
5,comfortable,"I was a bit leery about ordering online without trying the shoes on first, but the size was spot on! Also I ordered from Australia and was thrilled how quickly the order arrived. Will definitely use Amazon internationally again!"
5,Addicted to Crocs,"I LOVE these shoes. I seldom wear anything else. I am a potter and I also work a lot with animals. These shoes can get nasty and dirty but then, they clean up like new. I also have not had the ongoing knee problems that I used to have."
4,Great item,"Comfortable sandals, classic Croc design (not so pretty but you'll get use to it) but in my opinion kinda overpriced for what it is."
4,lime green crocs,This item was purchased a Christmas gift for a friend. She loves them. They are comfortable and the color is something she has been looking for
3,Barney purple,"Ugh these dont look like barney purple to me online!? Maybe I'm color blind, other than that there everything your avg crocs are supposed to be."
4,Like my CROCS,"I ordered a pair of these in khaki, size 8 and although they were just a bit small I kept them. I normally wear a size 9 shoe. I ordered another pair in earl a size larger. They were so wide and huge, seemed to be 2 sizes bigger, but did say they were 9's. I returned them for a size 8. The size 8 were pretty much the same length as my khaki's I bought earlier, but were much wider. I love the shoe, so comfortable, but sizes seem to really be different from color to color."
5,Great purchase,Wish I had bought more shoes arrived in just a few days. Super buy. Great product you just can't wear them out!!!
1,Darn! Wrong Size,"Wanted to be in the five star review group, but that was not to be this. I just got my Crocs - excited as I have not been able to find them locally. I live on the beach and walk everywhere miles a day, so this silly looking shoe has become a must have for me. I am a convert won over by there comfort and durability, but they are not a comfort when they run a size small. I returned mine, with the usually no problems return from Amazon and I have ordered more in size 9 instead of size 8. Lets hope the 9 fits, or I swear I will go back to sneakers."
4,Great Product,"This is a great shoe to wear around the house or on the boat. As all sperries must be worn without socks, this shoe took a little while to get adjusted to and worn in properly. Once in proper shape, these shoes were great. Although I prefer the more traditional and formal original topsiders, these are great for working in or just relaxing. I had to order one size smaller than normal to get the perfect fit however, so beware of the sizing issue."
5,Crocs rock!,Crocs are very comfortable and stylish. All my friends and i have them and we love them. Your feet do not get sore in these and the aren't slippery. You can also get charms to put in the holes called jibbitz. There are many colors and styles to choose from. Buy these! They are the bestt!!!!
5,Just what we expected.,"We weren't sure what size to get, and they are a little big. However, my son is only 11 and still growing, so we intentionally bought big. Overall very happy."
4,great foot wear,"The pair of Crocs that I purchased are very comfortable, fumctional, and exceed the expections I had when I considered everyday foot wear."
5,Great Crocs,"My 10y old Daughter went rafting down the river and lost one of her crocs. She cried she was so upset. I bought her a new pair immediately because of how upset she was. She loves her new crocs. Great fit, comfortable, great service! I should have bought myself a pair!"
1,I don't care how comfortable they are...,"These shoes just look ridiculously stupid on anyone who wears them. So, unless you are a little kid or a clown - please stop the madness."
1,UGLIEST PIECE OF CLOTHING EVER CREATED!!!!,"I feel sorry for anyone who has such severe foot pain and discomfort that they would have to actually wear these horrendous looking shoes in public.If you own a pair of these, do yourself a favor and LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR before you go out in public wearing these unsightly things. If you can't see how ridiculous you look, I just don't know what to tell you.... Other than that everyone else can see just how dreadful you look wearing these hideous shoes, and we're laughing our @$$es off at you!"
1,Please. Everyone. Stop! Please stop wearing thses.,"Let's get one thing straight. These things are ugly as sin. I'm not a fashionista or a shoe snob by any means. I mostly tend towards sneakers, and I own Teva flip-slops. I care very little for fashions. Crocks, however, make my eyes bleed just a little whenever I see them.Yes, they are comfortable. That does not make it OK to wear them. Many, many, many other shoes out there are also comfortable and also have the benefit of not being a crime against humanity. Wearing them with jeans or slacks is twice as bad, and makes baby Jesus cry. And if there are any hipsters out there considering them, it is also not OK to wear them ironically.Please. For the good of all humanity, do not wear these. Ophthalmologists everywhere will thank you."
1,These are not shoes,"I first saw these abominations on a 6 year old and I thought, it won't happen again; surely this is just a one time thing-but no. Then I saw another person wearing them and another and another, and I said ""oh no"" ""no no no"" ""please, no"". They are a complete fashion disaster. If good fashion had an evil twin brother, they would name him crocs. I won't even acknowledge anyone wearing these....things. Anyone seen wearing these catastrophes will be removed from my will. When I get one. Horrible, just horrible. If you purchase these, don't even look at me. I will ignore you and I will make sure you know I am ignoring you."
1,False Promises,"In general a negative buying experience. Item did not arrive as specified in the specified date range.I declined review of item twice and amazon keeps asking me still to review this object, which is really annoying and detracts from the overall expereince"
4,My Crocs:D,It finally came in. i waited for about 1 week and 2 days. The color was like blue green-ish.i thought it was going to be aqua -.- but i love it~ :)
2,it has not tha same quality as other purchased directly from the store,"it has not tha same quality as other purchased directly from the store.one is larger than the other, despite having the same size"
5,VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE,"When we received the crocs one was damaged so I contacted the seller and they shiped me right away another pair. The next pair arrived the following day! very pleased with the seller and the product, Crocs rock! they are so comfortable and great for backyard work, I got them for my husband and he's really happy with them too... and I must say, they are cute too!"
4,"Great Sandal, sized big","I purchased these for my husband. He has always worn a size 10, so that's what I got. They were too big for him, so I had to return them and get a size 9. Aside from that he LOVES these Croc Classic Sandals. Very comfortable, lightweight, great color (chocolate brown is what we got)."
3,Nice clog but they rub the top of my foot.,"These crocs are extremely practical despite the way they look. Feels like you are walking on air. They are great when I wear socks with them but when I go without socks, they rub the top of both of my feet in the same place (where you would normally have shoe laces on a shoe) causing blisters/cuts. Maybe I just need to get used to them, not sure. Anyhow, these are great clogs with one major drawback."
2,Too small,Last year I ordered the same size crocs from Amazon. They fit wonderfully. These are too short on the left foot. I ordered the very same crocs as last year. Did you change manufactures?????
1,Regretting buying Crocs there..,"I am a big fan of Crocs before but I now dont like it after I wear this. It is not comfortable, and I don't know why my feet even feel painful after wearing this. I don't recommend you to buy it. .. Hope seller can improve its quality."
5,Very comfortable!,"I had hesitated in trying them, but now I'm glad I did for they are very comfortable. They were just as described."
5,The best!,"If I could live in these things i would, i recommend them to all my friends and family. They are so comfortable and you can wear them anytime!"
3,Buy a size smaller,They were ok. I plan on using them just for gardening. They certainly are not my everyday shoe. Too wide and a tad too big.
4,Runs large,"Shoe is the typical classic clog. Ordered for my husband who wears a Men's US 11. Have returned this pair for a size 10 (which has arrived) and is also borderline too large. Love Amazon Prime with it's 2-day shipping, free returns, downloadable shipping label, feedback that the returned package has been received, Would give Prime 5 stars plus, but the shoe only 4."
4,Made in China now. Used to be Italy,I bought these to replace a pair of worn out crocs. My old pair were smooth and had a flexible rubber feel to them. They were also made in Italy. The new pair are a bit stiffer and feel like plastic. They are made in china. Well I've only owned them for a week and so far so good but I don't know I they will last as long as my previous pair (1.5yrs)
4,Bionaire Replacement Filters,"My Bionaire moves a lot of air and performs well. It is a bit noisy for me. The filters hold up as a solid replacement, sturdy and filter well. If you are using a Bionaire the replacement filters should work well for you. I do pull them out and clean them with a vacuum at lease once a month, pending how much I use it."
3,great but too damn expensive,i'd be much happier with these filters if they were 7$ each and not 20$. it just seems way too high for what it is and what it does.
1,"2 Per package, however Bionaire BAP650 requires 3","To replace the filters in my model, BAP650, you need three filters. They are sold two/pack. Either design the product with filters in multiples of two or sell them three/pack. How illogical and annoying!"
3,Not as Good as Expected,"It's on the noisy side (equivalent to perhaps an electric fan on medium). The output air smells a bit warm and stale to me, rather than ""fresh."" It does a good job of filtering dust, but it really hasn't made any tangible contribution to reducing my allergies. I think I'll shop for an Ionizing air cleaner next (when I have the budget)."
5,Very effective and easy to replace,These filters are very effective. The air really does smell better and is fresher. They are also very easy to replace.
5,works great,"once ordered it arrived quickly as described. after buying the tripod used I realized it was missing something, a way to attach the camera. I love it now."
1,Disappointing,"An Oblate of Saint Benedict promises to live their life in obedience to the church. Although you needn't agree, you must obey. Part of that obedience is the ability to refrain from spreading your personal disagreement in order not to draw others from church teaching.""Benedict in the World"" highlights several Oblates. Unfortunately, I found the highlights to be less than inspirational and, in one chapter, violating the promise of obedience.Chapter five tells the story of the Crowleys. This chapter borders on ridiculing the Catholic Church and the Pope for their views on birth control. It quotes the author of ""Papal Sin"" and explains that the Crowleys publicly dissented to the publication of ""Humanae Vitae.""I recommend that you pass this one by."
1,Word 2003 Users BEWARE,"There are big *UNRESOLVED* compatibility issues with Word 2003. The ""Cite While You Write"" feature doesn't work, which is a big deal. Don't be fooled by the endnote.com Web site--their seemingly easy fix doesn't work.Don't believe me? Do a quick Internet search on Endnote 7 and Word 2003 compatibility. Many have had problems."
1,Buggy Buggy Buggy!!!,"Their older versions worked perfect. But their new versions are so buggy since Endnote 6.0, e.g. memory leaks, word slowdown and freeze. Now, when I try 7.0, it always pops up an error saying ""Endnote is waiting for user information, please go back to Endnote program""? There is no information on their tech support page as well. I really doubt what those guys are doing for such an expensive software."
1,"Nice, but not for Mac OS X","I recently bought version 7 of Endnote for Mac OS X, and after downloading all the suggested updates for both Endnote and MS Word it crashed seriously many times. Although the software looks like a great tool, it is not ready for the Mac yet. Hopefully future versions will work, instead of crashing hard."
1,About to Give Up on Fantoms,"Here I am on the phone on hold - so far for ten minutes - for a customer service representative, because yet another part of my Fantom vacuum has broken down. Because there are features of the Fantom vacuum I really appreciate, like its light weight, Hepa filter, and easy-emptying canister that doesn't need a bag, I have actually purchased two of these machines in the past 3 years, thinking the first one might have been a lemon. In view of the fact that the second machine is now falling apart, I can't believe I was so dumb!Between these two machines, there is not one mechanical or connecting part I can think of on the spur of the moment that has not broken down and needed repair or replacement. Too bad. It's a good idea, but in my opinion a poor product. Surely it can be made to hold up better and longer. None of my previous vacuums of other brands had a track record like this. Consumer beware!"
1,"""Reconditioned"" means beat up piece of crap","The item I purchased was $20.00 less than a new one and looks like it's vacuumed its LAST floor. I could have probably bought one of these in the same condition for $40.00 at a yard sale.Oh well, live and learn. I,m now out of the $33.00 for shipping and handling and for what, nothing."
3,Not too Pleased,"I purchased this vacuum when it first came out on the market. A friend let me borrow his and wow! I was impressed. I later bought one and I liked it, I still do but it is in need for engineering improvement. The power head shuts it self off when it feels like it, and the power cord sticks, and when you try to pull it from room to room or around corners it smashes into the walls. The wheels could use a better design also. It is a lot to keep emptying the canister but at least it gets it clean. I love it but I wish the design was a little more thought out before going on the market. Would I buy another? Yes.. but only when they come out with a better design."
3,i work on these!,"i have worked on this vacuum several times, always something new.1st it was the retractable cord, no prob. made a new guard for it, works great, 2nd it's main mtr stopped, thermal fuse goes bad, replaced works great. 3rd brush stops spinning, red light comes on. brush mtr going bad, repaired brushs inside mtr. relubed bearings in brush. works great. to get parts for this go to [mfg. website]they still have parts for it.tim"
5,An Enemy of the People is agonizingly brilliant.,"While Ibsen's other two plays in this volume are great, neither can come close to the genius of, An Enemy of the People. Dr. Stockmann's battle for truth against the self-interested masses is perhaps the most agonizingly wonderful exploration into truth and individuality. Ibsen is a master."
2,quick shipment,"This item was a little pricey for what it was, but it was shipped quickly and was perfect for a last minute birthday gift."
1,PNY Flash drives suck,"This was bought for me by an employer. I was able to get one machine to recognize it, my Micron office machine running XP Pro. However, this drive wasn't recognized on any other the computers I have used it on: a dedicated offline Dell, my homebuilt XP Pro machine, my second home PC running XP Home, the networked Microns at the labs at work, my wife's IBM laptop, my IBM Thinkpad. And without the company receipt, Best Buy wouldn't take it back, and the receipt is gone; and it only cost $25 so it's not worth pursuing. It's still annoying, though.I don't know how PNY stays in business selling garbage like this. I've owned three other flash drives, including my current 1G Lexar JumpDrive, and never had a problem."
5,Portable File Storage,"The attache 128 MB USB 2.0 drive offered by PNY is a useful tool for those who work on more than one computer.If you have Windows XP, setup is a snap - just plug it in and you will be able to treat it like it is any other disk drive.The drive is small yet sturdy and can take some bumps. The device also has a lock feature (a la the old 1.44 MB diskettes) so that it would become write-protected.Remember one thing though - the Attache is not really designed to be rewritten repeatedly. If the user repeatedly erases and rewrites the Attache drive, eventually parts or all of the drive will become unreadable. Therefore, one should only erase and rewrite when absolutely necessary. Also, one should always backup his or her files in a location other than the Attache."
2,It died,"I used the PMY 128 meg USB memory stick for maybe 6 months and it died a quick and unexpected death, taking valuable files with it. I got the message ""this drive is not formatted."" And then I got the message ""this drive is protected."" or some such thing. I am out of of info and memory chip."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Don't buy it!!! Don't buy it!!! The first time I used it I copied some files to the 4GB Attache driver but later on when I decided to delete some of them I've got this deleting error message that the disk was write-protected. I called PNY technical support but they were unable to solve the issue. The thing is defective. They told me to return the driver for a replacement. But how can I return the driver loaded with sensitive info, that cannot be deleted, and get the replacement??? I am stuck with it! The PNY people were sorry that they couldn't help me...I am even sorrier that I have purchased this junk!!!"
1,Another Unreliable Unsupported Product,"As others have commented, worked great for 6 months, then became unrecognizable by XP. Wouldn't work with ME on other machine. Files not recoverable. Guess will try another brand. USB drives handy, but keep a backup on hard drive or other disk somewhere else since with this model its just a gamble and a matter of time before you lose your data."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this a little while ago, and it was working OK. However, the casing felt somewhat flimsy. About after a month of use, it would not work on any of my computers unless I constantly reformatted the drive. A SanDisk Cruzer or Sony Micro Vault would be a much better choice."
2,works ok - but not for key chain,"I wanted a flash memory drive that I could keep with me always - on my keychain. Although this product has a loop for attaching to things (like keychains) - the loop is very small and difficult to work with. After having it on my keychain for two weeks, the small plastic loop broke and the flash drive fell off - I almost lost it."
1,Bad.,This flash drive does not work with Windows 98SE. The back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for Windows 98SE at the maufacturer's web site. First I tried downloading the driver. Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver. After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC. The FAQ at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled. But the FAQ doesn't tell you how to enable the BIOS.
3,Nice while it lasts...,"I got this as a gift in May of '10. Set up and have been keeping it just the way the directions stated. Not too much algae growth and all that good stuff.After 3 months the shrimp began to die off. There were originally about 10 of them swimming around, then 6, 4 and now there is one lonely soul.It was nice to watch (have it set up by the iMac) while working, but now it's just sad.The one fellow just can't keep up. I clean the glass to help out, but still, it's really a bit depressing at this point.So, just to let potential buyers know, this in all likelihood is a very short lived experience. (Which explains the short life of the warranty the company offers)"
5,Finding Your Own North Star,"This is a superb book for anyone going through a life transition where they need to take stock and consider their future direction. Written with sensitivity, humour and style, it takes a person through the incremental steps needed to chart a course without being judgemental or preachy. I highly recommend it to people of all ages, who are asking themselves, ""What do I want to do when I grow up?"""
4,Motivational and practical,This is an excellent book because it provides motivation and very practical exercises to help to move the reader from wishing for change to making change happen. Martha Beck writes with a wonderful sense of humor as well as sharing her own journey which I found inspirational. Since this book is about potentially radical change she also prepares readers for that and for how to deal with the fear and internal resistance that may arise as one takes the steps to find a truly happy and rewarding life. I found the book provided hope and motivation in facing some difficult career challenges.
4,Never Judge a Book by its Cover!,"When I first bought this book, I bought it based on the reviews, not the title. Actually, the title holds a great deal of truth in this rather inspiring self-help book.The author is this book is a woman who knows her stuff. She shares some of the examples from her own life which lends credibility. The book also includes many exercises to assist in ""Finding Your North Star"". Some are better than others.Overall, I'd suggest this book to anyone who feels like their life is off track. The writer gets straight to the point of how to move forward to where you should be. This book coupled with a few sessions of therapy and a good friend will make you a happier person."
5,Wonderful,"I see myself and just about everyone I know in this book. It is a good read, interesting, insightful and has a lot of exercises to help understand what's going on in your life and how you can change the things that feel wrong. Martha Beck is just plain wonderful!"
2,godo for someone lost in heavy job,I thnk this book is good for someone lost themseleves in the heavy work and especially when that job is not suit them.
3,"Many details, less essence",The approach of this author is very detailed. I consider the problem of naming one's calling very brief and simple in case the right approach is applied. And this book is so detailed and so long and the printing is so minute...Too much for as simple subject as defining one's calling should be. Three stars for endeavour.
1,Not Gonna Find Your North Star Here,"Don't waste your money. Purchased the Kindle addition, made it through about 30% of the book before deciding the author couldn't point you the way out of a paper bag. You want to see the North Star??? Look up in the night sky, you have a better chance of seeing it there. I would've rated it a zero if Amazon allowed that."
1,Book almost killed me,"A friend of mine, meaning well, approaches with this book in hand. ""This changed my life,"" I hear, knowing full well their life is the same drama it has always been. So I read it to humor her. I could just cry sometimes when I see people are in such pain that they will attempt to find peace in anything, no matter how nonsensical, weak, useless, illogical, or just plain silly. This book was a prime example, reading it made my heart weep that anyone could feel so empty or whatever inside that they would abandon reason - that which makes us more than just another animal - and accept any of this. The so-called self-help industry is awash in this feel good nonsense, with the only goal of parting you from your money. But hey, if you want to live your life obeying what amounts to slight symptoms of indigestion, be my guest. My heart truly goes out to anyone who feels desperate enough to swallow such frivolous techniques as truth."
3,finding your own north star,seller did not indicated there was writing in the book. book in good condition other than that. arrived in timely fashion.
2,"Book in good shape, but so many underlined passages I wasn't aware of.","Book in good shape, but so many underlined passages and the underlines distract from my enjoyment of reading the book. I underline my books that I do not intend to sell. I wish I'd known the book I chose to purchase had so many underlined passages. I would have bought another one."
1,Excellent,This is a great book. Martha Beck is a wonderful writer with clear insight. A must read for anyone seeking their true path in life.
1,A Book for People with Unlimited Resources,"I think this book would be great for the college educated, wealthy house wife that is looking for her next adventure. I don't fit that category. Some of us are just trying to pay the mortgage and find decent health coverage. You have to be in a position to make the choices Ms. Beck suggests before you have the freedom to act on them."
5,This book is like air,"I can't recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who is or ever has been through a major life change (and who hasn't). That's why I say that this book is like air. I can't think ofanyone who would not benefit from Beck's insight. I have already given this book as a gift. I would especially recommend this book to all of the high achievers out there who aren't happy in their ""successful"" lives. Beck gets it. She'll help. No gimmicks here; no quick fix. Just real solutions from someone who's been there."
4,Worth you time to read..Like having a life coach!,Author has sense of humor and many good thoughts which help you to see your life more clearly.This book is used by many life coaches to help you find out why you react and think as you doHas areas to fill in with your own personal information to make things specific to you...Think you would benefit from this one!
2,"good writing style, humorous in places, but useless advice","If you can fnish the following sentence, ""I was always meant to become___________."" you will know what your ""north star"" is. No one can fill in the blank for you. No one, including Beck, can give you your ""inner compass."" This is the gist of the book. Do you really want to pay $10 or more for this?"
5,so much truth and humor,"This book is so awesomely good. It is full of truth and humor, and although she doesn't say the way to your true life is easy, reading this book will make you feel positive and strong about getting there. The author emphasizes joy, and this is truly a joyful book."
5,very good read,"I admit I have not finished this book yet and not done the exercises suggested, but this book is so thought provoking and helpful to those of us who have no idea what to do with our lives. Instead of some namby pamby self-tests (which I do like taking though) or limited lists of career choices out there, this is a book that forces you to look at your whole life, how you got where you are now, and where you want to be in the future.It's probably a good read as well for those who are happy with their work, but not with other aspects of their lives since many of the suggestions and exercises have nothing to do with career."
5,Martha Gives You the REAL Keys to the Kingdom of Personal Freedom,"I came to this excellent book via The Joy Diet, and Leaving the Saints -- previous books I loved by this hilarious, brainy, irreverent, zany, altogether brilliant and engaging author. Even her dog Cookie has great life lessons to impart.Enjoy enjoy...and remember:I told you so!"
5,Tuning in means tuning out,"When you experience a natural inclination to be a certain way ... it is something to pay attention to. We all have a natural flow that is in line with who we are. The challenge is to be true to it. Life often conditions you out of your real self early in childhood and only as an adult can one claim their destiny. Martha Beck uses the analogy of an inner compass for one's life direction called The North Star, to navigate the waters of work and career. One's intellect can override the natural intuition of the heart and Beck's method is a way back to our true instincts. A great book on being more of who you are rather than trying to be what you are not."
5,Navigate your life,"Beck's sassy style and mixture of life lessons, wisdom, and leading questions are an enjoyable read. Not only did I find my North Star ... Beck's method promotes the courage to claim your dreams. This is a book for anyone committed and ready to say good-bye to people-pleasing and hello to their authentic life. Two other books that were invaluble to forging my career path were ""The Authentic Career"" by Maggie Craddock and ""Now What?"" from Laura Berman Fortgang. Career evolution is a journey ... and you won't get lost if you keep your eyes on your own north star."
5,"Good self-help, even for smartypants","Beck writes in a good, non-patronizing, humorous way. Good self-help for people who find a lot of the self-help books annoying."
4,I was lazy about the exercises but...,"...I still enjoyed this book. It was funny and witty and comforting. I do think it was a BIT too long but the lady had a lot to say! I always enjoy her column in Oprah's magazine, so I got the book from the library. It really could be life-changing if you let it be, and you're in the right place for that. I think I would have gotten more out of it had I done the excercises but they were sort of exhaustive. That said, you don't get what you want without some hard work."
4,Martha Beck Was Recommended by someone,"I cant remember why I bought this book, except someone recommended the author. It is a fair book, but her style does not inspire me."
1,NOT 9/11,None of the horror and terror of 9/11 is here. You would never think most of the compilation was about 9/11. Very antiseptic. The filmaker could afford to be dispassionate. It didn't happen in his country.
1,Garbage,"This movie seemed like a series of the worst student films I have ever seen. In addition, some of the acting was the worst since the invention of film. Avoid this garbage as if it was an on-coming semi truck."
2,Just an Unabashedly Anti-American Diatribe,"This DVD was just the opposite of what I expexted when I first popped it into my player. As it turns out, most of the films in this collection put the blame squarely on the US for inciting the WTC attacks. A few, like the Chilean story, imply that the attack was poetic justice. Some actually seem to trivialize the loss of life on 9/11. Even the US entry, directed by Sean Penn, has an ambiguous ending that could be interpreted as seeing positives in the attack (flowers begin to blossom in the newfound sunlight created by the collapse of the towers).On the plus side, all of the films are technically slick. In particular, I thought the darkly comic Isreali entry was brilliantly staged and photographed.I'm a liberal. I welcome a diversity of views. But I also value honesty. This is just anti-U.S. propaganda masquerading under the title of ""September 11."" If thinly disguised U.S. bashing is what you want, you'll love this."
3,Lovely Necklace,"The glass heart was larger than I expected, but that was an attribute. The ribbons holding the heart were also very pretty. The only problem was that I felt I was getting a good deal at (I believe it was) around $10. Several weeks later, I was in a gift shop. They had quite a few of the same necklace and others similar to it. They were selling them for three for $10. That was a disappointment, but who knew?"
1,"Where's ""Summer of '69""","I don't know what you people are talking about this album is by no means Rock and or Roll. Its garbage.... Where is the catchy tunes and riffs that made this Canadain rocker a legend worthy of hall of fame status... ""I bought my first real 6 string, ohh at the five and dime"" now thats Rock'n'Roll!!!! I agree with the rest of these guys, I'd rather buy a Yanni CD than waste money on this overrated self indulgent mess...."
1,Poor example of music,Avoid at all costs. A bad attempt at making music of any kind.I can make better sounds on a tin can.............
2,Rock and Roll Over,"This sounds closer to Bryan Adam's version of ""rock n roll"" than Paul Westerberg's.If you wanna hear real rock and roll played sloppily, buy Paul's Come Feel Me Tremble. If you want to hear phony rock and roll played cleverly This Is It."
5,Masterpiece,"This album brought back rock from the dead. At least to those who know what rock is/was. I don't care about the musical direction Mr Ryan Adams is going to take next, as long as he keeps producing wonderful music. People that are in love with Heartbreaker or Gold, whatever, will also love R&R for great art should be loved no matter the genre it belongs to, and because great music, like this album, is great art, universally"
4,Better than,"I give this record 4 stars in part because of its relative competition. It is actually a 3.5 star effort. I agree with the critics who say Rock and Roll lacks the emotional tug of much of Ryan's past work (both solo and with Whiskeytown). But, I think that was his point. Does it make the listening more rewarding knowing that he achieved his intentions? No. Does it make these simple rock songs derived from his influences unenjoyable? No, again. A nice bunch of songs to tide you over until he gets ready to dump his emotional baggage on his fandome."
2,"I feel cheated, want my money back!!","Totally derivative. If you're a young person or new to the lo-fi/3 chord/garage sound, you may like this. If you've been listening to this sub-genre for the last 20 years, you'll likely find it to be totally uninspired, derivative and formulaic. Others have done it before, and have done it much better.I bought Faithless street in 1998 and have followed Ryan's career for almost six years now, so I'm not just dumping on him here. Although, this record mirrors his live sound much more closely than anything he's done up to this point, the songs are just so bland and mediocre. If you've seen him live, you know he can do this sound much better. I'm disappointed and wish I'd spent the money on Paul Westerberg's new records. If you're reading this and aren't familiar with Mr. Westerberg, check him out, you'll see where Ryan got the idea..."
1,the unfortunate decline continues,"Not that I have anything against him. I really like heartbreaker. Fantastic CD. I am happy that he has found commercial success. Unfortunately, that has come at the price of the heart of his music, which i think gives it any staying power or worthiness of more than one listen. It certainly lacks what made Heartbreaker great, and what made the following CD's ok. You might like it, but that means you like crappy music. Oh well, so be it. But try Heartbreaker, a CD with so much more to it."
1,"no heart, trash","not the ryan adams that i have grown to love but thats not the main reason that this album sucks. no heart was put into making this album, just 2 weeks of getting stoned. i must admit the songs sound a lot better live than they do on this album..."
1,Heard it before,"It's all been done before; there isn't a single new riff or fresh idea offered here. For a songwriter and musician as gifted as Ryan Adams, this disc is a huge disappointment. For current fans, pick up ""Love Is Hell"" parts 1 and 2 but avoid this train wreck. If you want to turn friends on to Adams, share any of his other work, solo or Whiskeytown. The musical contents of this release can be summed up by...""bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam...bam."""
2,Not quite crap,"No matter what anyone says, it is never a good idea to charge studio time to your credit card, get drunk with your friends, play endlessly, record it all, and then give the stuff to your record label. The care not put into this record shows. It's simply not that good."
1,Disappointingly Weak,"Do I appreciate the fact that Ryan Adams is a gifted songwriter and musician? Yes, he has clearly proven that many times over... but that doesn't mean this album contains good music.I just don't dig it."
3,Oh Ryan ....,"""rock n roll"" is a big departure from his alt-country style. Looking for Whiskeytown or ""heartbreaker"" or ""gold"" here, you will not find it. The sound is stronger than ""demolition"" - whichI thought was a filler LP with way too many ""cheesy"" songs that sounded as if it can straight from the GOO GOO DOLLS. Sort of has a clean later-Replacements sound with some songs with a touch of older-U2. Can we expect Ryan to be consistent with his material? Probably not."
1,Skip it. Buy the Love Is Hell duo instead.,"As others have said, its not Gold and its not Demolition. And its certainly not ""good"" Rock N Roll. You've heard the story, his record label thought ""Love Is Hell"" wasn't worth releasing and sent him back to the studio. Apparently this is his joke on them. There are a couple of decent songs here, but for the life of me, I can't figure out the 5 stars heaped on it. Lots of mindless music cranked out here and not much else. Go directly to Love Is Hell 1 & 2 and you'll find yourself enjoying the ""record"" that should have earned a 5 star rating. And you'll say, ""what were those record execs thinking? This is great!"" This is one of Ryan Adams' great tragedies."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"As much as I loved his last album, Gold, and his previous work with Whiskeytown, I'm am severly disappointed by this album. His writing and performance on Rock N Roll is horrendous. It's one of those cds that gets progressively worse the more times you hear it."
3,Trying real hard,"I am a big fan of Ryan Adams. Loved his work in Whiskeytown, loved his previous solo releases. But once I started to see Ryan do Gap commercials and then actually wear the Gap clothes he is peddling in photo shoots etc., I started to get a little worried. Rock n Roll is definately a logical direction to go, but I am sorry I hated the 80's when I was living it and I still hate that sound in music today. Perhaps I attached myself to Ryan's music because of the simplicity and common man/woman quality to it. This record to me spells pretension, I know Ryan has better ""Rock n Roll"" in him than this shotty super catchy happy go f uc k yourself sound he presents here. I think its time for Ryan to get on Heroin. I'm ready for the punk and blood he claims flows through his body. The finger isn't it either. Eddie Vedder needs you man."
3,Still Ryan Adams,"Not to beat a dead horse, but this album does grow on you. On first listen, it sounds like Adams severs ties with his alt-country roots; seeking to make a purely ""rock"" album. However, multiple listens reveal the same old Adams. Clearly different stylistically from his earlier efforts, this album still delivers the tight knit songs with introspective lyrics that we have come to expect.""Wish You Were Here"" is a more rock version of vintage heartache Whiskeytown songs. ""So Alive"" and ""Boys"", besides sounding like early U2, have the unique Adam's pop sensibility. ""This Is It"" and ""Luminol"" draw from the harder tracks heard on ""Gold"" and ""Demolition"". However, most likely by intention and to my dismay, this album is void of acoustically driven gems such as ""Factory Girl"" and ""My Winding Wheel"".""Rock N Roll"", although somewhat of a departure, is a solid album that only complements the wide range of songwriting heard from Adams thus far. A definite highlight of 2003."
4,so i can imagine there are skeptics,"but it's still a great album. it's definitely the album of a morrissey fan. ""So Alive"" is an amazing song that I'm sure will be making many an appearance in my upcoming mixed cds.Love is Hell, pt 1 is also brilliant!"
3,I REALLY wanted to like this album,"I tried differnt moods, settings, setup, everything to get into Adams' vibe on this disc but I couldn't do it. The other reviews are right, he's rockin' the hell out of this album. The instrumental side is kick-butt and tight as hell. Lyrically this album comes up short. I like to rock out as much as the next guy but my music also means something to me and I couldn't find it here. If you want something to throw in the player at party or rock it on the open highway then this is a solid buy. If you want an album you can hold onto for a while then may I suggest Gold or Demolitions."
3,Summer Of 69,"As I listen to Rock and Roll, something knaws at me. What could it be...what could it be. Could it be that this album sounds, rather shockingly like BRYAN ADAMS??!! Alas it is true. Just as Garth Brook's idea of full on rock and roll was Seal and Crofts, Ryan Adam's Idea seems to be corporate rock circa 1984, Dire straits, Hooters and yes Bryan Adams. This is a shame because on songs like Gold's ""Enemy Fire"" he seemed on the verge of something new blistering, raw and new. Rushed albums are fine for Iggy Pop, but Adams, for better or worse is a craftsman like his buddy Elton John or Elvis Costello and needs time to make something good. Rock and roll is what it is, a toss-off. I'll buy it of course, because I'm a fan, but greater rock and roll exist elsewhere."
4,Ryan Adam's other musical dimension,"The bad reviews comes as quite a suprise coming from Ryan Adams fans who seem oddly suprised that his sound has changed. If the pieces haven't fallen together yet, Ryan gave clear signs of his fascination with the Smiths/Morrissey in the opening track of Heartbreaker when he argues with a friend about which album a ""Everyday is like Sunday"" is on. The new release ""So Alive"" finds Adam's vocals sounding a lot like Morrissey which should be the next big hint.Ryan is attempting nothing new as a lot of people assumes he has, his other influences have just surfaced in this album, the ghosts of Madchester are alive and well in Adam's songs. The people that seem suprised just haven't been paying attention.The new album is reminscent of the luminous sound of James, the Sundays, and the Smiths. The songs are a refreshing oasis from the tired nu-metal fad that unfortunately dominates much of radio today."
1,very lame,"This album is such a complete disaster that it makes you wonder if the formerly talented Mr. Adams has indeed lost his mind. Sure this 'rocks', which basically means there's some heavy electric guitar scattered across the album. But this new found heaviness results in an album that favours sound over songwriting. These songs are horribly trad-rock, generic and mediocre, more Stereophonics than Stones if you know what I mean. To be honest, when I heard that Ryan was making a rock album, I was thrilled and envisioned a bunch of rootsy, blues flavoured Stones-like rockers. Instead we get this mess, apparently delivered with a straight face. The Love Is Hell EP's aren't great either but they're better (and cheaper) than this pile of garbage. Avoid at all costs."
3,Cynical and generic but what the heck...,"This is pretty much the record for the unadventuresome 15-year-old in all of us. There isn't a single song on Rock N Roll that doesn't sound ripped off from two or three earlier ones but hey, I'm easy. I bet you are too. Slide it on and put your brain to rest."
1,Not likely to be a fan ...,"I finally bought a Ryan Adams album because Amazon and other sites wouldn't stop reccommending it based on what I like. Not my style at all. It sound like some kind of cross between the Smiths and the Ramones, and it doesn't work. Some of the tracks are okay, but there are a few that are SO bad, the record is terrible as a whole.I'm not sure why this stuff is reccommended to me. My time would be better spent going to the nearest corner bar and listening to a garage band. This ""artist"" should not be a ""national act"" at all."
5,Great album!,"This album is unpopular with fans who are not pleased with his more contemporary sound. I think it's different for Ryan, and yes it's not the album he intended to make (since Lost Highway scrapped LOVE IS HELL and asked him to make this album, even though LOVE IS HELL was released as two EPs anyway and pretty soon just as one CD) but it's still pretty good. Contemporary doesn't equate bad music. ""So Alive"" was a great choice for first single, one of my favorites on the album. ""Anybody Wanna Take Me Home"" is another highlight. The title track is an interlude, which seems out of place because it doesn't resemble the sound of the rest of the album, but it's nice. Would have been better if longer. ""Do Miss America"", ""This Is It"", ""Shallow"" are all great uptempos, where he's more reflective on songs like ""The Drugs Not Working"", or ""Burning Photographs"". Overall, a nice album from the talented Ryan Adams."
4,Lucky us!,"Ryan Adams' response to the current state of rock-especially pals The Strokes and the White Stripes-plays like a greatest hits album for a rock career he hasn't pursued at all. Often accused of faulty quality control, Adams has made a short (under 50 minutes) album that never slows down long enough to question its quality at all. It wasn't the album he wanted to make-look to Love is Hell for that-but we're lucky Lost Highway pinned Ryan into a corner. This album is well worth the trouble it took to get it made."
4,Big Bag o' Influences,"This album is a fun listen for fans of rock and roll music. Ryan Adams wears his influences on his sleave, and each track seems to recall another major artist. Paul Westerberg, U2, I think I even heard The Cure in there somewhere. But it's not so much a rip-off as a homage to his musical peers. While this work may have been heavily influenced by other artists, it also has it's own soul.There is a great variety of style and tempo to the album, so you'll probably start by liking some tracks, not liking others, and then changing your mind a few weeks later. A good album to grow into. Personal highlights include ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Note to Self: Don't Die""Best line ever: Don't change, just lie."
4,-,"i love ryan adams for making this cd. it's a departure from his usual and expected style which might be a good thing. his rebellious, passionate, and desperate natures come through stronger than ever and with his bold experiment he proved that he was up to the challenge of tackling rock and roll. when he was with whiskeytown he sang ""...so i started this damn country band 'cause punk rock is too hard to sing,"" but it's obvious that he's found his nitch in rock. tracks 1-3 are excellent, 5 is my very favorite, and the rest aren't too shabby either."
4,Nice addition,"I must confess that I am an unapologetic Ryan Adams fan. While not in my top 3 Ryan Adams/Cardinals favorite CDs, it is certainly a welcome addition to any fans collection."
2,Not his best - For a good reason,"Most of the folks who are fan's of RA will agree that this isn't the best album. There's a good reason for this. Ryan wanted to release a much more sombre album. The record execs said it was too ""down"" and told him they wanted something a little more ""Rock and Roll."" Adams provided these recording and (probably out of spite) released it under the title ""Rock and Roll"". I think this was a big FYOU to the label and his heart probably wasn't in it, for the most part. He went on shortly thereafter to release the record he wanted to on his own in the form of two EPs ""Love is Hell"" Parts 1 and 2. Love is Hell is the real Ryan."
2,I've tried to get into it...,"I listened to this album first in a music store and decided against it. A friend of mine told me that she really liked it so, a few months later, I went to another music store and listened to it again and thought, ""What the hell..."" I have tried on several occasions to listen to it, and I can't get through more than a few songs (frankly, I can't even remember which ones I can tolerate). While I'm disappointed, I'd rather spend my money on a crappy Ryan Adams CD than on some of the other stuff that's out there. Perhaps my disappointment stems from the fact that he is capable of so much more (or at least of making music that is more compatible with my tastes).I saw Ryan and the Cardinals last fall and, to my great joy, they played songs from every album EXCEPT this one. If that's not an indication of the artist's own feelings about the music, then I don't know what is."
3,Uneven,"3.5 starsReminds me of REM's MONSTER-- At the time it was released, a lot of critics thought it was heavy and great-- Now the band says they don't really care for it and you can find more copies of this REM cd in used cd bins than any other. I like almost everything else by R. Adams more than this-- Paul Westerberg's new cd is, on the other hand, a great rock and roll record (COME FEEL ME TREMBLE)."
5,One Of My Favorites in the 00's,"As has been pointed out in previous reviews, this record has so many direct lifts from other rock songs (my favorite is the tremolo-heavy King Missile riff from ""Detachable Penis"" used on ""Burning Photographs"") that it could almost be a covers album.However, that's all balanced by a tongue-in-cheek vibe in borrowing those riffs, and that's why this record is so much fun. It's a musical wink-and-a-nod, and it just flat-out rocks in most places. The production is crisp, the guitars sound fantastic, and Ryan's singing surrounds it all perfectly."
3,Ryan having some fun,"There are some really good songs on here, and there are some forgettable ones. This is Ryan Adams after all. Mr. Adams seems to have a penchant for genre hopping which is not a bad thing, in and of itself. However, some artists tend to stretch it a bit and end up actually sounding like they are imitating. Mr. Adams seems to be at his best when he's doing something a little earthier and rustic, not punk rock. In fact, in the punk world, I think that Ryan would fail quite miserably. Suffice it to say, there are some rockers on here and they are well worth the listen, 'Luminol' and 'Anybody..."" in particular.We all wish that Mr. Adams would get his act together and hire an editor of sorts(and possibly an etiquette tutor). But seeing as this will never happen, we will have to be satisfied with the solid but patchy handiwork of the delicate troubador from North Carolina."
3,"Probably his worst, and it still gets 3 stars","This is simultaneously the worst and best album I've heard in quite a while. How is that possible? First of all, look at this record song-by-song. The guy is ripping off T-Rex, Oasis, Nirvana, and every other big name band of the past 30 years. But he does it with a cocky wink, so much so that its difficult to not nod along with every stolen hook on this thing. Its this brazen attitude that ultimately saves the album from swimming in mediocrity, but it doesn't redeem it completely. Some of these songs would be lame no matter what artists they were stolen from: namely Do Miss America, and 1974. Skip those, but give the rest a try. Its not his best work (Heartbreaker, Demolition, and anything from Whiskeytown) but you're still better off with this than anything from The Hives, Yellowcard, or whoever else MTV happens to be whoring as of late."
2,"Somewhat catchy and fun, but distinctly mediocre","I have to admit, I like this album a fair deal. The songs are catchy, but they're very very simple, and they fall apart on multiple listens. The lyrics are boring, the riffs are boring, and the whole thing feels really, really phony, and it feels like all Adams is doing is making up something about himself to make a few bucks, and it's shameful in the end. I have nothing against an artist like Adams changing genres...I'm not so attached to Whiskeytown that I can't let it go...but his rock efforts are really quite weak. Give us a break, Adams, and put some effort into what you do."
3,I don't love it or hate it.,"I was leary of this album after reading several reviews by Ryan Adams fans who seemed to be let down. Rolling Stone and other publications, however, reviewed it favorably. What's a person to think? I've been looking forward to this day for two months so I could rush out and get the new album.It's not the Ryan Adams that we all know and love. While I wasn't wholly disappointed, I was certainly hoping for more. ""Demolition"" wasn't my favorite either, but after several listens it did grow on me. I'll hope the same is true for Ryan's latest.I found ""Love Is Hell, Part I"" to be more satisfying. I'm anxious for Part II. It surprises me that Lost Highway wanted this album to be released over ""Love Is Hell."" I found it to be more like the Ryan that I love. Check it out."
4,Introducing this side of Ryan Adams,"Ryan Adams has thrown off the alt-country label for real this time. Rock N Roll is as far from Ryan's Whiskeytown days as he could possibly get. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just very different. Ryan's greatest asset, in my humble opinion, is his voice. I miss hearing it on this album. It's there but you have to listen very hard on most songs to hear it. The catchiest track is ""Wish You Were Here"", but it is full of profanity which means you shouldn't play it around young kids, or on your computer at work. I suppose that Ryan Adams is trying to make a point, but I hope he's not purposely trying to alienate his long time fans. I'm sure he'll gain legions of new ones. Buy this album, it will become a classic and you'll be glad you have it in your collection. Listen to it a few times and you'll probably grow to love it, just don't expect to on the first listen."
5,ryan being ryan,"This album does not fit the alt. country mold, but then again when has Ryan Adams ever tried to fit into a mold. This is Mr. Adams putting out an album that all goes together under a common theme. . . . Some of these songs were written well before ""Gold"" even came out (the song 1974) but he's always tried to put out records that flow, hence why all the songs on ""Rock n' Roll"" have a Rock n' Roll theme. This album is simply amazing and the guest appearances from both Parker Posey and Billie Joe Armstrong just make the album better. This is a well produce and more importantly well written album, and any Adams fan should enjoy it; if for nothing else the sharp and insightful lyrics."
3,Not His Best,Not crazy about his rock oriented songs. Listen to it before you buy it and if you like his earlier slower music you probably won't like this one.
4,"Not sure how to rate it yet, but...","I think its interesting that people deride this CD for sounding so bland and mid-tempo... if you listen to the songs you realize that most of them are in the style of other bands... listen to This is it, it sounds soo much like The Strokes, Luminol with Foo Fighters, 1974 with Smashing Pumpkins, etc...just my two cents"
3,Frustrating,"Frustrating to listen to...Some songs make me want to throw the cd out the car window, as it sounds annoying and too whiny. Sometimes it sounds like he said, hey if the Strokes sold a million debut albums, why don't I try that? I wonder if the rockin' is a bad sellout crossover attempt or just him cutting loose.Then at times, it's back to the more gentler roots rock that is absolutely beautiful and I forget the other not-so-good songs on the album.So it's a completely frustrating album for me. I personally liked the Love Is Hell EP more than this album. I wonder which path he'll take in the future...."
3,"""Love is Hell"" is more like it... ""Rock N Roll"" lacks originality","I got into Ryan Adams' music not too long ago. I first heard his ""Love Is Hell, Part 1"" album, which I simply loved! Now, hearing Rock N Roll, it sounds a bit like a pastiche of 70s and 80s guitar-driven R&R songs, without much purpose or intent. Very much in line with most of the acts ""out there"", which forces me to take awat a couple of stars from it. It simply lacks originality. With the exception of ""So Alive"", the rest of the album is not bad, just simply a bit more of the same!"
2,Derivative Crap,"I don't understand how so many people think this album is genius. It's just a watered down version of Paul Westerberg's worst material (post replacements rock tunes - westerberg's worst stuff). I understand that Ryan is 'eclectic' and 'prolific', but this stuff should never have seen the light of day."
3,Always Worth a Listen,"Ryan Adams courts ridicule. His albums are uneven because he puts it out as fast as he writes it. On this one, he can be mocked for trite lyrics (""... takin' me higher than I been before"" - Shallow) or bombastic arrangements (Note to Self, a couple of others), but then he utterly drills a song like Anybody Wanna Take Me Home, a simple idea on the outsider theme that rivals the best of Brian Wilson or, yes, the Smiths. Ryan Adams is in his prime. Listen now so you can tell the kids you knew him when."
2,"Easy to use, but not technically correct","The book is easy to follow, and can help a non-programmer pick up the basics. The problem is in the code examples. The code examples in this book all compile, and the binaries run, but if you enable warnings on your ANSI-compliant compiler before compiling any of this code, you will see a whole host of warnings and error messages. Don't think that you will learn C from this book and then go get a job somewhere as a C programmer. Your code will be as non-ANSI compliant as it could possibly be while still working. This makes it even more difficult if you progress to a more advanced C text after this, as you will likely have to go back and relearn quite a bit. I give it 5 stars for ease of use, but it loses 3 stars for not ""teaching good programming practices"" as it claims to on the cover."
2,Not that awesome...,"I am learning programming on my own, and really am an absolute beginner. However, I just finished chapter 3, and for chapters 2 and 3, the exercises in the end require information we have not yet gone over in the book, such as using string characters, including more libraries (using the #include header), and one instance asks me to take a character and an integer and compare the two (which can't be done).For those of you who NOW know nothing about programming, if you REALLY want to learn it WELL, I do NOT recommend this book, as it will lead to much frustration when you attempt the exercise questions, or when you get to real life problems for which you would like to use C to solve.I also could not get the suggested compiler to work properly that the book suggests, so I downloaded DEV C++ from bloodshed."
3,Good if used in conjunction with a class,"took a college course on C and this was the required text. written so just about anybody can understand. well written with few mistakes, but not as complete as it needs to be to learn C by yourself. If your taking a class, this is a great companion. If your trying to teach yourself steer clear. Numerous times when code written included subjects not covered earlier in the book. Overall well written, but incomplete."
3,A Mixed Bag,"I enjoyed the author's previous book very much. I 'd like to give this book a 3.5... I really enjoyed the first half of the book - the development of the characters, the writing, the storyline, etc. As someone involved in the Jewish community, I especially enjoyed the Jewish educational piece through the descriptions. as I got started I it really felt like a delightful read for my recent vacation. However, about 1/2 way through (why does this happen with so many books - both fiction and non-fiction!) As the book reached it storyline climax, I cared less about the characters than I did at the beginning. I no longer could believe what was going on.All in all, I would share this book with friends, but would let them know to expect a book that has some really lovely Jewish parts, but has a mixed story line."
2,Joy does come in the morning,"I liked a little of this book, the psalm ""joy does come in the morning"" besides that I was bored out of my mind. I have no idea where the good reviews came from? This book is plain boring. I forced myself to finish it, but I was glad when I woke up in the morning and realized I wasn't reading this anymore. There are some great lessons, but it just never became a good story."
2,Great Title... Poor Execution,"The concept of joy coming in the morning, despite whatever came the night before is profound and promising. Unfortunately, the book didn't deliver on its promise. I never grew to feel any affection for Lev, his bride to be (Deborah), Lev's mother, brother, or even his briefly suicidal, fast declining father. Without caring about the characters I felt little for their somewhat contrived dilemmas (finding oneself performing a funeral service, getting fired, having a crisis of faith). I finished the book hoping that something would move me. All I was left with was a feeling that life is messy and complex, even for characters I cared little about."
5,"Rabbis are people, too","I loved this book. I loved that the main character was a woman rabbi. I loved that the author allowed her to be a human being and not a cardboard stereotype. I loved the ""coincidences"" in the story, and especially that some of my own beliefs and even quotes that I love were in this book. This book resonated in me on several levels. The only part I had trouble with was when the rabbi's boyfriend conducted a funeral, but that was mild. I felt this book had a lot of spirituality and love, and was, in an everyday way, very mystical. I couldn't put it down."
2,Contemporty novel disappointing,"I found this to be yet another boring contemporary novel. It ranks right along with Aloft and The Corrections as yuppie-esque and uninteresting. There was nothing about any of the characters that caused me to care about them at all. Deborah, the rabbi, seemed irresponsible in how she approached her faith. I'm sorry I spent the money to download from audible. (The reader drove me nuts. Her voice is absolutely annoying.)."
3,Product is cute but comes folded in the box.,"The product is cute but I assume to save on shipping costs, the tail is folded on top of the gator in the box. This leaves a permanent crease in the pinata. Its not a huge deal but I wasn't happy to see that. Also, the pull string kit is a do it yourself kit which includes cutting a hole in the pinata and patching it up with different colored tissue paper. The gater is dark green and the tissue paper is lime green. Not thrilled about that either. But my son likes it and since its for him, we kept it."
1,Bad Shipping,I'm sure the product would have been fine if whoever shipped it didn't fold it in half to fit it in the box. I had to order another one from another company and that came to me in perfect condition.
3,Incredible Photography,"Benno Thoma captures the essence of men, while giving the readers a bit of wanting to be like them"
4,An art educators delight.,"Learning Through Art is a wonderful teacher tool to expose students to art and artists through fun filled reading, writing, and observational activities. Many students have never visited or explored a museum. Learning Through Art gives students a feeling they have been able to visit a museum to discover and learn about art, art history, and art of many cultures. I share this book with students at the beginning of every school year and they love the activities."
4,Great mouse for a great price,"First off, let me start by saying I'm using this on Mac OS X. Using the Kensington software (most recent can be downloaded) it behaves perfectly. And I love being able to program the buttons to act differently for different applications. I've only been using it for about a day and I'm already hooked. I could never go back.For $20, how many other electronics devices make that much of a difference?"
3,ouch,"This mouse is bigger than Mouse-in-a- Box which I am used to. It's too big for my hand! I started having arm cramps/pains within the first day of use. I gave it away to my husband, who seems to like it........"
4,nice mouse,"It's a little big, but not too uncomfortable for a man. A woman, child, or other small-handed person might like a smaller mouse. The scrolling is very smooth. Much nicer than my old Optical Elite. The MouseWorks software makes it a breeze to program the buttons. I use the side clicks to go backwards and forwards in pages in Safari (web browser) and Word. I'm using it on a Mac running OS X Tiger. My only complaint is that the side buttons are both on one side. I guess the idea is that you use your thumb to click either, and that's ok, but the size of the mouse makes it a little difficult to use the side buttons efficiently. I prefer one side button on each side."
3,Mediocre at best,I bought this mouse for work as I have rather large hands and have enjoyed kensington products back in my wired mac days. The scroll wheel placement is my gripe too. It is not comfortable to reach and should be further out twords the end of the mouse. I like my old trusty logitech wireless optical at home much better.
3,"eh, not that much bang for the buck",This is OKAY... nothing special... I use it more for foreplay than anything else really. It's not very comfortable to wear.. but like I said - if you use it for foreplay rather than getting off then you'll be alright.
1,Don't Buy this,"This is the worst buy I have done, It does not work at all, it does not have any power and it is unconfortable. It's a waste of money. I try it once, and never used it again. Not pleasureable at all."
1,not worth it,"The part where the straps are latched to the plastic of the butterfly broke the first time I used it, vibrations were decent, very hard to get the straps adjusted to the right size."
3,His tooter stopped,"When I received Walter his tooter worked just fine. When my granddaughter received it at Christmas, he had run out of any gas. I have ordered a new one so she could get the full effect."
4,Little Boys Love It!,What better than a farting dog for 4 and 5 year old boys? It brought us into a discussion of their own dog and his farting ability and other animals ability to do the same.
3,"Neat idea, dumb book","Great idea, kind of a dumb book. Not really a good story. To long and it just does not really hold my kids intrest."
3,smaller than expected,"I thought it was a little larger, although it clearly states that it is 8"". It wasn't creative on any other level than sound. The color was bland, the material was unremarkable. For $15 I guess I expected more."
4,A funny toy,It's a fun toy and I think my nephew enjoyed it very much. It is also the fan of the show so it is more advisable if you have a special liking for the character.
4,Walter the Farting Dog,"Walter The Farting Dog is cute. Walter was a great gag gift with 2 loud sounds! Smaller than expected. Looks like an oversized Mickey D toy. 8"" from tip of nose to tip of tail and at the most, 4"" tall."
3,The Farting Dog,This toy is a cute prop to accompany the Walter books. For some reason I pictured it a little bigger. The sound producing device is sometimes hard for little ones to locate.
4,Walter The Farting Dog is great fun for the kids!,"Bought it for twins, age 4. They love it! They show it to everyone, and take it to Show & Tell at pre-school.Mom is embarrassed :)"
4,"Funny, farty dog","I ordered this book after seeing one at the library. Kids think farts are funny so what could be funnier than a farty dog? These books help kids find humor in an unfortunate human function--everybody farts. The illustrations are really good, very colorful, and children would like them very much. I bought the book for my great-grandson who will LOVE it."
5,"Spanglenhelms, Cataphracts, Spathas...","I love this series and its publisher, Osprey. Only the British can put out such quality. Besides the excellently detailed plates, each book in this series gives an historical overview of the subject's time period.I've always been fascinated by the Roman Empire, particularly the later Christian period. This book (and its companion, LATE ROMAN INFANTRYMAN AD 236-565) shows the influence of Germanic and Iranian styles, weaponry and tactics which not only transformed Rome's military but also layed the foundation for the development of the medieval knight.Be sure to purchase both books together."
5,NOT BAD,"I bought this product for someone else, who decided upon trying it out that it was not for their purpose. I now use this backrest in my study for all of my desk work. I never had a problem, but I believe this item is helping me even if I don't know it -- it keeps me straight and supports my lower back -- it's very comfortable."
4,Good for an office chair,"I needed some back support for my chair at work. This helped a lot. I like the fact that it has a handle so I can easily carry it to another chair for meetings, etc. The clip makes it easy to secure to a chair."
2,It wasnt good.,It did not help me at all. I am sorry. I spend 120 Euros and it wasnt of any use! The old obus forme I have its much better and I use it a lot.
4,Dramatically Reduced My Lower Back Pain,"Although not perfect, the *ultra* has helped quite a bit. The convex design is radically different than most support products on the market. In fact, I originally purchased a cheaper Obus backrest that was concave in design and it didn't have nearly the support of the ultra. I am 5'11"" and I purchased the large because it was cheaper and available for fast shipment (I was in a lot of back pain that day). I am glad that I purchased the large even though it is recommended for 6'2""+. You can adjust the backrest vertically several inches so it is safe to go bigger if you are unsure what size that you need. This product does force you to sit up straight which in turn prevents you from slouching your shoulders. This may be somewhat uncomfortable at first, but it sure beats the back pain that I get from leaning back or slouching over in my chair too long."
5,awesome!,"awesome - bought for myself during recovery of a back injury and it worked wonders. If you sit or drive for extended periods you will LOVE this thing. My wife liked it so much bought her one - I am 6' and 180lbs and she is 5'5"" and 125lbs and it works great for both of us - you won't be disappointed."
5,Very good at the price.,The back support system is certainly worth the price compared to something almost identical at over $700. Thanks to whomever for bring out something that is good but reasonable.
5,"Obus Forme Ultra Forme Ergonomic Orthopedic Back Rest,",Being on the small side I use it to adjust my forward position while piloting. I also have a few back issues and forget the rest is even there - no problems or aches and pains to think about.
2,Unsure as to helping with pain,"One issue is the width of the chair back and that of the back rest's straps. I did buy a slender ergonomic chair and adjusting its chair back seems to help more overall than the slight pressure of the bottom bulge of the Obus on a lumbar region that has herniated discs, a narrow canal, spondylothesis, spondylosis, etc. Opiates, TENs, and Spine Worx work where I can feel results."
2,hurt my back,"i bought this because my car seat forces me to hunch over. i drive 2 hrs a day and have constant pain by the time i get home. i have a small frame 5'6, 130lbs with a small waist. whenever i sit down, i never feel like i have enough lower back support. i purchased this thinking it would help my problem. first of all, i was excited because it wasn't hideous but once you get the thing in, you can no longer rest your head. i liked the back support at first and then noticed much more back pain once i got to my destination. simply put, there's not enough lower back support. i ended up using my memory foam pillow until i can find something better. would love some recommendations if anyone has them!!"
4,back support,"Overall, I find this to be a good product. If it had a little more support for the lower back I would love it!"
4,"Bright, Crisp, Clear","Our department replaced a bunch of high-end Sony CRT's (the kind with the great Trintron tubes) and I have to say that the general consensus is that these new X73s are GREAT -- a lot of bang for the buck. First of all, color quality is great (we work with photos all the time) and I especially like how sharp and black text is on these monitors (I'm an editor, and spend hours looking at text.) No, these X73s aren't as fantastic as the Apple LCDs, but few can match Apple's LCDs. For a great price/performance LCD, I would highly recommend these to anyone who has to look at a screen for hours."
1,Non acurrate info about this items,"The description given by this seller was not accurate. He forgot to mention the dead pixcels and the brownout right in the middle of the monitor. I will never by from this seller. I had bought used monitors and they were right on the money with the description, so no surprise. I was very mad when I plug this monitor and discover all the flaws not listed. Any other person would it send this back. I didn't because I hate to do returns. What the heck I will eat this one because is the first and last from this seller."
5,Great griddle,This is very well made and does a great job. It cleans up easily too. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
5,"The ""Breakfast Machine""","I LOVE this!! It IS non-stick, and it is fabulous. We cook bacon, sausage, eggs, hamburgers & lots of other things on here. We use it almost everyday. I would definitely recommend it to anyone - it is amazing!!"
5,good buy,I really liked this dvd. The instruction was very good and not to complex if you are new to this type of dance. It is a bit weird to see a guy performing these moves but he was a great instructor. I do recommend this one.
2,"Not so much Burlesque but more ""Burlyesque""...","This DVD was okay. Not a big fan. I am really into burlesque and striptease style dance. This video was mostly just a Rodney James sales pitch. He is not sexy in any way, shape, or form. Just plain nasty lol. Like the other review said it's not very feminine but more burly movements. Burlesque is graceful and a art. This was anything but... The man can dance and he can move I just think the DVD would have been alot better if it was a sexy female dancer showing us these moves. He does do counts for you which is nice. You can mix and match routines. Maybe good for a straight beginner but I still see error even it that. Kinda feel like I wasted my $$$ Hopefully there is truly a Burlesque DVD out there we can learn/benefit from dance and work our physique."
3,Low-intensity and for beginners,"If you are looking for a low-intensity workout, step right up. There is no fancy footwork, complicated moves or strenuous activity on this DVD. The warm up/stretching portion could be a dance routine by itself. If you are bothered by men in high heeled shoes, move along."
2,not impressive,"I tried to do the routine, but this may be for dancers. I had a difficult time keeping up with this routine. It was fast paced and have only tried it once. I am back to doing my Zumba."
3,ehhhh...,"this really wasn't what i expected... rodney james is wayyyy over the top.. guess i knew that going in, but was hopint that it would be more of a fitness dance workout then just a routine... a little disappointed, but i'll probably do it a few more times and see if it picks up a little better... may be fun to do it with my girlfriends.. lol. :D, other than that, this one stays out of the weekly rotation of workouts. :(, so i give it 3 stars, it was so-so."
1,not good,"The pace was too slow for this to be a good cardio workout, and I felt more stupid than sexy doing the moves."
4,My Ten Cents,"First of All:Rebecca from Medford...I think you need your ears checked because there is a HUGE difference between some country twangin' southerner and a richly soulful Canadian. Not that I don't have mad love for Leann Rhimes, she has some good songs that I like to listen to but I honestly cannot see how one could mistake the two. Leann has a slightly deeper voice, while Tamia's voice is higher and more raspy, yet, still crisp and rich. As where Leann bellows out her notes, Tamia belts them. There is a difference; if you cannot tell the difference, then you shouldn't point out your own inadequacies as a human, just simply fade into the background while the rest of NON-audibly challenged listen to our music unabated by your useless commentary.Secondly and Lastly...Tamia is a great singer who doesn't get the credit she is well deserved of!"
5,Not A Stranger Anymore,"This one of the best R&B ballads to show up this year. Tamia's smooth voice transforms what could be a simple love tune into a smoking emotional ballad. A song about a relationship that is drifting apart, this also has the on fire video, and a catchy upbeat album track called ""Un'h...To You"". If you like this single, check out the maxi-single, which has mixes that transform this from a slow groove to a full dance anthem."
3,It is okay.....,I bought this cd hoping to hear this mix I heard on the radio for Stranger In My House. It was not on there. It was the regular vision. I later learned it was a Smooth Silk Hurley remix or something like that. I did like the fact videos were with the cd. I do not know any of her other music sadly.
5,The Tamia Remixes Are GREAT!!!!!,I first heard the remixes at a club in New Orleans while on vacation. Great dance beats and one song is even slow enough to grove to. Would recommend it highly!!!!
3,"Great City, shame about the Symphony","Visually, this is a very good product, with excellent b&w film of 1920's Berlin. The musical accompaniment was appropriate, but very faintly recorded and TV volume had to be on full in order to obtain sound at a moderate level."
4,A magnificent portrait!,"This a landmark film carefully filmed in the middle of the Weimar Republic Walter Ruttman built this gem movie .This is a great documentary . Berlin seen in perspective under the lyric gaze of Ruttman , unfolding from dawn until midnight . The film captures the basic insights of this multi facet city .Who can deny this film inspired to Win Wenders to make sixty years after his memorable The sky above Berlin , best known as Wings of Desire?"
1,No OPUS on bootlegs.,"Be careful buying used copies of this DVD. Mine was a bootleg and the ""bootlegger"" neglected to put a copy of OPUS 1 on the DVD. It was the only reason I bought the DVD in the first place."
1,What a disappointment,"I was hoping to get to see some good vintage performances from some classic artists. Instead I seen lots of talking and a few short short snippets of performances. What a waste, I know somewhere there is archived film footage rotting away in a box somewhere. I could be watching that instead of watching a whole lot of documentary."
3,Hank,"Thought this was a movie that was gona show different singers and all, but oh well still enjoyed watching it"
1,Not much Elvis...,"If that's the same thing I saw on video years ago, there's probably no more than 2 or 3 minutes about Elvis... Remember, this is the story of the history of the Louisiana Hayride... NOT Elvis at the Louisiana Hayride.. (and that's only 62 minutes, so don't expect much Elvis on this DVD). If you ALSO like the L.H, then get it. (But if you are only an Elvis fan, not a L.H. fan, like me, this may not be worth it... get it on sale at Wallmart, or Ebay): )"
3,"A lovely, lyrical start which went downhill","After capturing relationships in a truly beautiful way, O'Connor had to go and spoil everything by going all Tarantino. What could have been a truly great book sacrificied to fashion."
3,Clarification for NLP readers,"This Joseph O'Connor is an Irish novelist, NOT the NLP trainer and author of the same name."
5,good color and forumla,"Love this polish! It's a bit streaky, so if you're super picky about that you might not like it, but in two or three coats it's not even noticeable from a distance. Very long lasting, too. Wore it almost a week before taking it off, and there was only minimal tip wear when I did."
1,Heavy mailbox,The construction of the mailbox was excellent. The finish was black powdercoat. The paint was scratched down to the bare metel prior to it being shipped. I sent it back for a replacement. The second one appeared to have been dropped prior to being shipped. The paint on this one was chipped down to the bare metal also. The product is excellent however the person shipping it out needs to be more careful. I sent the second one back too. I will not try a third time.
5,"Hot dog, it works!!!",With in about 1 month of getting this beast it was put to the test. Just before going to bed about 1 am I heard lots of loud bangs outside. I knew exactly what it was. the vandals took off and I went to survey the damage. Mine just had some minor pings from a crow bar while the neighbors was pretty much flattened. It is still sitting pretty as we speak. Well worth the money!!!
4,Great product,Our mailbox is located under a basketball hoop and gets hit constantly. The previous one was thin sheet metal and was pretty banged up so we wanted something that could stand up to this abuse. The Solar Group TB1B0000 fits the bill perfectly. It's make from some pretty thick steel and the balls don't even leave a mark. The door is held closed with a magnetic catch so it doesn't fly open when the ball hits it. This is a good sturdy mailbox and well worth the extra money.
4,Great item for medium or advanced players,"This is a good book but definitely not for a beginner. Especially if you can't read music. Would work well along with lessons.It's a great book for more advanced pupils. Like other instruments, playing scales gives you more practice and skills to handle more difficult pieces.I would order this product again."
5,"Lionel Hampton, an infectious personality","This is one of my favorite CD's (I have lots of favorites). I don't have very much with Lionel Hampton, so it is a joy to hear him in an intimate setting play the piano, the vibes, and sing (yes, sing!). The conversation is interesting, touching such areas as being a black performer in a difficult time and getting tired of playing How High the Moon.Hampton doesn't have a great voice, but he does have a great personality, and that comes across in his vocals. It's fun to hear him switch from vocals to vibes to piano.I particularly like the Mack the Knife and Sweet Georgia Brown numbers."
2,Hardly listenable,"I had high hopes when I purchased this CD, but was disappointed by it overall. Each song on the CD is prefaced by awkward and uninformative conversation between Ms. McPartland and Mr. Hampton -- sometimes as much as 6 minutes worth! The musicianship is competent but neither Mr. Hampton nor Ms. McPartland are challenged musically by playing in partnership with the other. You're probably better off getting separate CD's of these otherwise fine musicians rather than this uninspired and uninspiring collaboration."
3,Useful Reference,"I refer to this book regularly while working on my FreeBSD systems. It's hard to call it much more than a hard copy of the online handbook. The lack of an index is an annoying shortcoming. The book is a good companion to Greg Lehey's ""The Complete FreeBSD"" book. For basic setup, configuration, or general information it's very useful."
4,"Great Little Headset, except....",I really like the Nokia BH-800. I have a A900 phone from Sprint and with other headsets I frequently lost paring with the headset. I rarely have this problem with the Nokia. My only complaint is the in the ear piece -- it's to big for a normal size ear. I think Nokia had only men in mind when they design the ear piece. Even with the over the ear hook (which is optional) it still not a good fit; however it's a great fit for my boyfriend... but that doesn't help my situation since I got it for me.
4,"Excellent, but requires ear loop","Everything about this headset is better than I expected. Quality, ease of use, design, etc. The one complaint I have is that there is no way it stays in place without attaching the included ear loop. It's not a huge drawback, but it would be more convenient and elegant if it could be used without the loop."
2,"Comfortable and attractive, but poor sound quality","The unit is small and looks attractive compared to other units. HOWEVER, I found the sound quality to be unacceptable. This is my first Bluetooth, so maybe my expectations are unrealistic, but I can't hear without static on this thing unless I hold the phone (Samsung A920) up near my ear within a foot - which defeats the entire purpose.Other negatives are that the neckstrap us useless - you can bump it right out of the holder. In addition, the headset plays a long tone (3-5 seconds) when you get a voicemail. Quite annoying - you have to ask the person to repeat what they said every time it happens. There is no mention in the manual of how to turn this off.Again, my first Bluetooth, but I was disappointed with these major inconveniences given the price."
2,No sound with 6131 (v5.5 firmware) either,"Worked fine with a co-workers phone (Samsung i730) I just hear connect/disconnect ""bleeps"" and will successfully force the phone to redial.There were reports that the BH-600 works with the 6131 (v5.5) but don't know about the 6133.Bought the BH-800 hoping for Nokia compatibility ... very disappointing to say the least."
2,Not so good,"I bought this for my husband after his research showed good reviews. Well, it didn't work well at all. Always static in the line, if he walked just a few feet away you couldn't hear him at all. He used it for about 2 weeks and I convinced him to send it back."
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed. there is generally always static. I have trouble hearing people and they have trouble hearing me.
1,Defective out of the box,The BH 800 bluetooth I ordered was defective when it arrived. I was very disappointed. It took 3 phone calls before I received any response and there was no option for a replacement the only option available to me was a refund. I went to the store and purchased another brand. I have a great headset now. I may never purchase online again after this recent experience.
1,A high price for a wooden box,"First of all the four movies on four discs are black and white not color as advertised.The quality of both audio and video are the originals of the 1940's.On a scale of 1 to 10(1 being the worst)the quality is 1.At times peoples' faces were totaly blurred.The only thing of value is a real wooden box with pictures of ""Roy"" in color.If you want the best western movie product on the market, buy Hopalong Cassidy volumes one thru eight.You get five movies in crystal clear audio and video(black & white) per volume for $6.99 each at Amazon."
4,Practical and Hopeful Information,"I thought this was a terrific book on using nutrition and related approaches to ""heal"" MS, primarily because Ms. Rigg does not advocate any one particular approach but rather emphasizes the need for each person with MS (or any other health challenge) to do lots of research and figure out what works best for him or her. Her emphasis on keeping a diary to record reactions to different foods and the inclusion of many recipes are both practical and useful ways to help the person with MS. After almost a decade with this disease, I am tired of medication and even more of insurance companies, and am committed to trying the nutritional approach to MS by starting a diary this week. Thanks Ms. Rigg!"
4,Good book.,"Recommended to me by a nutritionist....quick and easy read, with lots of information. Will flip through it again one day."
2,You People Are Insane,"No one knows better than I that the Raspberries should be fawned over, and given a break for past achievements... But please! I'll cut to the chase: 1) Duh! No Eric Carmen! (and you say but butbutbutbut... and I point out!: No Eric Carmen!) 2) not a single one of these songs is on a par with any song on any of the original Raspberries LPs, and you know it. Don't give me the Aging Gracefully blather either, John Lee Hooker still packed a punch til he was like 80.Scott, Wally and Dave have every right to play music together if that's what they wanna do. But I will call a spade a spade: it's not really the Raspberries, and this record isn't good. But please buy Raspberries s/t, Fresh, Side Three and Starting Over NOW, because the Raspberries are the essence of a beautiful and powerful and very special thing. Just don't look for that essence on Refreshed."
1,disappointed,"first,the plate is not yellow,as pictured,but a terrable shade of brown.it is not 8""and is of vary poor workminship.sorry i bought it."
5,Read this book and have your MD read it too.,"Dr. Fishman presents information in an easy to read, caring manner. This books not only provides education, but also illustrates how some doctors really do listen. It is a great reference guide to have and an important book to read before you go to a pain clinic.. This book will help patients and family members be able to better advocate for services and treatments. Pain clinic doctors, primary care physicians, and medical students should read it to help them avoid providing the the same menu of treatment for any patient who walks in their door. Thank You Dr. Fishman for a informative and hopeful book!"
1,War on useless books,I heard Dr. fishman on public radio and got excited that maybe there was hope for my chronic pain. After finishing the book I realized this guy is only out to sell a book and promote his practice. The book was a waste of time and money and gave me more reason to be depressed. He offers little information that will give any hope of curing pain. In the end you walk away from reading it with the feeling that it is hopeless. So don't even bother wasting the thousands of dollars it takes to get tested and prodded because in the end you will never be cured. Save your money and buy some other book amazon has in its vast arsenal that will get your mind off of your pain
4,Looking forward to filling it all up,"Bought two books based on the reviews and am happy with them. Very colourful, good questions for each level/grade and what I especially wanted - nice, big pockets for storing 8 x 11 sheets of paper. I researched many of these kinds of books and this is the best one. Amazon gave the best price compared to other stores, including online ones. The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because in our school system, we have Nursery & Kindergarten and we also have pre-school before Nursery (although pre-school and Nursery are technically optional). The book only has pre-school then Kindergarten, meaning I'll have to combine two years into one page."
4,very happy,"I am very happy with this product, I like that it is large enough to keep art work without folding it, and there is a place for my daughter to write her name each year and see how her writing progresses each year. It is a very colorful book and I am thrilled with my purchase and look forward to filling it out every year through to her high school graduation!"
4,"Cute and simple, yet effective","Bought this one because of the size (fits regular size paper).Does not fit too much work because of awards/report cards (limited space- so purchased expanding file for good work and art).Had kiddos write in sharpie, careful to let it dry and worked well.It's a little dated in the graphics and some questions.However overall the process and the momento it will be when they are older is priceless. :)"
5,Great Keepsake Book,This book is great for holding all my daughters memories from school. I love the fact that I will have this to give her when she is older. I truly believe she will appreciate it and enjoy it as much as I do.
5,Awesome,"Wonderful product! We bought three of them, one for each of our kids and it was just what we were looking for to continue the record keeping beyond the baby book! Thanks!"
1,No Space,"This book has only a folder pouch, no pages for putting pictures, displaying anything. My other son has one that has at lease 6 pages per year to attach memories. I'm selling this in the yard sale and buying another one."
2,School Memories,"Quite a good layout and good size, but I am in Queensland, Australia and a few things aren't right for our school system. We do kindergarten then prep (book has Preschool then Kindergarten). I did not think that through. Also units are not metric. I am going to look around for an Australian one now."
5,Really pleased,"This is just what I was looking for. I got this for my grandson. Now he finally has his own school memories book, after having to watch his sisters look through theirs and show him all of their school work. Now he has his own and he is so proud!! Has big pockets to store all those special memories."
5,Awesome!!!!,"This is a wonderful organizer to keep school treasures i.e., report cards, writing samples and drawings in a common place."
5,School Memories Album,I had one of these for my son but the outside got wet & ruined a couple of pages. Luckily most of the mementos could be saved & I ordered a new album & transferred all the memories.
2,Just ok,"It's cute but not very big pockets for keepsakes. We returned it for the larger ""School days"" keepsake memory book."
5,Nice!,"The pockets are large enough to hold a standard 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper, woo-hoo! So my son's treasures will not be wrinkled. In addition to fill-in-the-blanks that help you and your child remember details such as favorite color, teacher's name, height, etc, each grade has a place for your child's school picture, a place for his signature, and storage for paper keepsakes. I love it. The only improvement they could make is maybe making the book expandable to hold more keepsakes. Sometimes it's hard to choose just a few!"
4,Help children develop multi-focal literacy,"Buy this book! As a librarian, and mother of three, I highly reccomend this book and CD for both children and adults. This initiative by the Irish Hospice Foundation joins the considerable musical talents of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer with spirited illustrations by Bono to create a richly rewarding sensory experience.The narration and orchestration are novel and pure listening pleasure for children and adults. The practice of enriching text with thoughtful art and quality music has the well-documented effect of promoting literacy and improving cognitive skills in children. This project does that, and does it extremely well.My only complaint with the book is that the size is too small to share easily with large groups of children."
5,Peter and the Wolf,Wonderful! A delightful story with interesting illustrations. A fresh change from the typical children's book. Accompanying CD brilliant. Highly recommended.
3,20 Qt. Roaster Oven,"This product was very handy for preparing our Thanksgiving turkey, freeing up the standard oven for other things. It cooked the turkey much faster than I anticipated - plan on no more than 15 minutes a pound.The only drawback - the bird wasn't nicely browned. If anyone has a hint on how to accomplish this, I'd appreciate hearing."
4,Replacement parts are not to be found,"I bought the Rival R0200 Roaster Oven to increase my oven space for the holidays. One oven isn't enough sometimes. I actually liked the oven, although the ham was done much sooner than I expected. But the top plastic handle got broken while I had it stored in my garage, and I cannot buy a replacement. I emailed the manufacturer, and my email was forwarded to The Holmes Group. Their response was: ""Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately we do not replace handles on the lid. Sorry for the inconvenience."" This is more than an inconvenience, its a safety issue. The handle is what holds on the viewing window."
3,Should have known better to buy Rival,"Very good cooker for the first 3 times I used it. And I should have known to not buy a Rival product. Every one of their products I have bought ended up not working after just 1 to 5 uses. Slow cookers, deep fryers and now this Roaster Oven. And when you call Rival, they don't care. No offer of replacement or refund. You have to beg for that.But yeah, if you want a roaster oven that works good before it takes an early and sudden death, this is the one. And never call Rival customer service."
4,20 qt roaster oven,love the digital readout. easy to adjust the temperture. the see through window eliminates the need to lift the top. Easy enough for my kids to operate. I use sometimes in place of my oven since it doesn't generate the same amount of heat in the kitchen as the oven. Only down side is it doesn't brown meat very well. Would absolutely purchase again.
5,a good investment,"I do a lot of BBQ and this roaster is a great finisher for ribs, brisket and shoulder. Holds up well and it keeps on going. I use it often and love it."
1,Bad tracking,"The tracking on this mouse was terrible. I tried multiple surfaces just to be thorough and every surface resulted in jumpy movement. It really comes down to something like a low sampling period. It claims to have high resolution, but I think in order to conserver power it samples at a lower frequency that a normal wired mouse. I am sending mine back. I just purchased a Logitech MX1000 laser wireless and the results are absolutely superb. It was 2x as much but comes with a charger/docking station and tracks better than any wired mouse I have used."
2,Non-standard mouse4 and mouse5,"I don't know if there is a standard position for the mouse4 and mouse5 buttons on the left side, but this mouse had the buttons backwards from every other mouse that I've used (Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer, unknown Logitech 5 button wireless mouse).The mouse itself worked ok. It seemed a little jumpy, but I think all wireless mice are like this."
3,Interesting reading,"I have a interest in the David Lynch adaptation of Dune. So much so that I am still (Part-Time) interviewing and researching a book on the making of the film.Ed Naha has written a competent and informative book in the same standard as other 'Making of...' books. In a book of this purpose, none of the problems with studios and post-production are ever to be aired. This is, and never was, to be like 'The Devil's Candy'.We are given plenty of anecdotes concerning the making of the film and a very informative first section concerning the earlier attempts to film 'Dune'. We are also treated to description of scenes that were later discarded during the editing of the film.For those who are still interested in more information about David Lynch's film, I would reccomend them to look at Harlan Ellison's two part essay on the film (to be found in 'Watching'), Frank Herbert's intro to 'Eye' and Paul M. Sammons article in a double issue of Cinefantisique."
3,terrorism again,"Cassina Dixon is 13 and dead. She narrates her existence after being killed in a terrorist bombing which also kills her little sister. As a ""para-spirit,"" she passes through a bunch of people, including the actual bomber and his religious zealot of a boss who wants him to bomb again.This is a fairly unique take on the whole life after death, hovering above thing. The ending is rather good, but I didn't feel like I really deeply knew the characters well enough to make this a great book. It will be an easy sell to the teens though!"
4,"Easy to forget, a pleasure to remember","I'd forgotten all about this book until I was going through an inventory of my library in preparation to move it to me from storage. I couldn't remember what it was, so looked it up. As soon as I saw the cover here, I started laughing. It's that funny: I'd forgotten all about it, but just the sight of the cover brought back all the sense-hilarity. If you like your humour with a bit of bite, and alot of visual repetition, this is for you. All about horrible, horrible snobby girls.And pay no attention to reviewer Petrov; reviewer Petrov can't even spell!"
1,they'll print anything these days...,"I went to college with the author and he started doing these sketches in the undergrad newspaper as a comic strip on weekly basis. They were quiet pathetic and rarely funny, it's like he pulled them out of his ass every week, trying too hard to make they seem brilliant and original. Instead, they were dorky. Yes, I said it, dorky.Now all this pathetic untalent is published in one big unbook.Would you pay 15 whole dollars for a series of strips from an undergraduate newspaper that were not even funny to college students?If you care for the trees or your sanity, skip this book. If you don't care for either, still skip it. Just for the hell of it. I dare you!Get Dilbert if you want something funny. Get a pack of white printing paper and number the pages if you just want to buy something that looks like a book."
4,"good ""saturday afternoon read""","normally nobody would read a book about university life written by a young recently tenured professor of hydrology on a beautiful saturday afternoon as i did. but this book is different.given that you are interested in academic life in US, once you start reading this book, its difficult to put it down soon. excellent first hand account of the inside stories of universities in US. a must read for anyone hoping to get tenure or aspiring to be a professor himself !!!! good show professor !!!"
3,falling apart but exactly what I paid for,The product arrived fast and was exactly what I needed ad paid for. I had no issues with this company. I will defiantly use them again in the furture.
3,Best Reference Available (But That's Not Saying Much),"Good generic reference but sparse on useful details. For example, difficulty in following instruction disassembling door. I ended up feeling my way about via trial and error. Locating placement of parts in my 1999 Nissan is often an adventure. Need to replace the heater motor resistor; can locate on wiring diagram but I'll be damned if I can locate in vehicle."
3,For an after market manual it does a good job.,"I rarely rebuild an engine; but I often replace swithes and relays. This manual is little weak in these areas. I does have some schematics that I have found lacking in other after market offerings. One example is the system to allow you to trouble shoot the locking system for the steering wheel and shift lever is not there after you locate symbols in the diagram, it takes some real guess work to locate them physically. I wonder if I would not have used the money spent to purchase more expensive shop manuals."
3,OK...but not the greatest,"The handle for this screwdriver is VERY long, so if you're short on space, this is not a great tool. Also, the magnetic, telescoping head is good for picking up things, but because it ""telescopes"" (like an antenna), the bits sometimes come out of the screwdriver. It's functional, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Not Just for Girls,"I was a little put off by the Barbara K logo, but it had what I was looking for. I wanted an ""upstairs"" screwdriver, one to keep in a drawer for little repairs upstairs without having to go to the well-stocked workshop in my basement. This isn't a girlie-man tool, it's a solid, journeyman screwdriver. Magnetic bits of enough sizes and a light that either shines where you're pointing the tool or detaches. The only thing more I would have liked for this type of tool would have been a ratcheting mechanism."
2,A Reference For Career Centers rather than individuals,"Over 87 Resume samples are included with a little bit of advice how to write them mixed in.The resumes are split into very specific sections ranging from sales, health care, science and accounting, so for one person a large amount of the book is not hitting a direct target. Good for a career center where many different people will look."
4,EXPERT RESUMES,I bought this book for my small business reference library to use in preparingresumes. It is a good book for reference.
4,A good reference for updating resumes,I found this book at a bookstore and after reviewing it I decided to purchase it. It has several good resume examples. I used this as a reference when I updated my resume. These samples are very professional. This book is targeting experienced professionals. A good buy.
4,Good book for those who haven't recently written a resume.,"This book gave me some great insight on creating a resume, which I haven't had to do in the last 13 years."
4,BT40 fan,"Lots of wind, low noise. If operated horizontally, it makes noiseas the shaft moves back and forth. Angle needs to be 5 or 10 degrees away from 90."
2,"Poor transfer, darn it.","Wel, let's agree that the 1935 version, with effects by Willis O'Brien, is the one to see. But fans of Steve Reeves should enjoy this entertaining rehash, with modest but effective destruction scenes. Too bad nobody has given Reeves work the attention and restoration it deserves: the films are not presented in widescreen, and the prints are really terrible: washed out and filled with scratches and other imperfections. Wouldn't it be nice to see these Italian-made historical dramas cleaned up and restored? They're Reeves most lasting legacy, and it's sad to see them so poorly treated."
1,WIDESCREEN POMPEII,You can get a Widescreen Beautiful quality copy from Amazon France.Just type in the name in English.Avoid the U>S>A> Release.Its in English & French with a Doco though this is in French onlyThey also have Samson in Widescreen though this is French onlySAMSON is now available from Sinister Cinema in the same top notch print in FULL WIDESCREEN & English DubbedBoth DVD.s are quite cheap. 5 Stars for this oneRock on brothers Paul
4,Last but not least,"Overall one of Steve Reeves best movies. Certainly his most lavish. Good sets, great arena scenes and quite a good ending showing (some of) the actual horrors of Pompeii'a destruction. Sure it's sword and sandel.But it's one of the best with some exciting action sequences. Mike Markowski....Dorchester, Ma."
5,Better than I expected,"Very nice comforter set...SOFT cotton, brightly colored but still a classic, great for a young boy or a college bound teenager & well made so it will last."
1,Awful Print,"The printing on this book is awful, words are too small and seems they are trying to save on inks so words are too faded out to be read. Already gave up after 20 pages"
5,Complete indeed,"A great resource to not only learn about the history and mechanics of heraldry, but also for inspiration for creating one's own coats of arms. I mainly picked this up to create heraldry for my strategy table top war game, but the historian in me enjoys it as well for scholarly purposes."
4,Raw,"You definitely get your money's worth here as it is a three cd set. The only disadvantage is the mix is kinda raw. Other than that, great names such as Oakenfold, Roger Sanchez, Chris Lake, fatboy slim, Above and beyond, marcel woods, gabriel and dresden, the prodigy, basement jaxx, royksopp, mylo, and of course, sasha xpander. The highlight of this set is the 2nd disc, towards the end."
2,Poor Description,"This product only holds ONE 5X5 photo. It is an album for 4X6 photos, so DO NOT buy it if your wedding proofs are all 5X5!"
3,Average,"These glasses were fine, but I ultimately returned them because they didn't feel like they were top quality. Probably worth the 25 dollars I paid but a little cheap feeling. Amazon was great about the return."
5,Nice gift.,I bought this for a gift for my mother and she and others she knows like the way it smells. She has been asked where she bought it by men wanting to buy it for their wives.
5,Great Read,This is a great read. This high action international thriller is difficult to put down. It is convincing and tackles some very relevant scenarios being played out in the international scene today. It is very believeable and has been written well. I highly recommend it.
1,Could Have Been Good,"The story in this book is a good one, but it is written in such a stilted and stiff way of writing that it turns out to be just plain boring. Perhaps the author should find something else to do besides writing books."
4,A good collection at a great price,"Although I think the collection ""Every 1's A Winner - the Very Best of Hot Chocolate"" (red cover) is a little better retrospective, you can't beat the price for this CD. With its focus on Hot Chocolate's 1970s songs, it leaves off a couple of good 80s tunes, but it includes the essential tracks You Sexy Thing and Every 1's A Winner. Some may even prefer this one, because it also includes some good songs not found on the other album. (So get both - I did!) Although a few songs sound like filler, there are plenty of catchy melodies and great rhythms."
4,"The Brits had the funk, too!","If you like David Bowie's funkier tunes, then you'll dig these guys. The production of the tunes is actually a bit raw for disco, but it adds to their vibe. It's not so much disco cheese as disco rock. If you can appreciate what I said in the past three sentences, then you'll dig this album. If not, you might not want to bother."
1,cheaply made.,"was send broken, so was sent back. Not build good enough to buy another one. Went with a Kenwood amplified box instead. Better quality."
2,NOT WHAT I'D HOPED FOR.,PERHAPS FOR SOMEONE WITHOUT ARTHRITIC HANDS THIS SHOWER WOULD BE TERRIFIC. NIETHER MY HUSBAND NOR I COULD ADJUST THE SPRAY SETTING NOR OPEN THE HANDLE TO INSTALL THE CARTRIDGE..
4,Great Spray...,"I bought this shower head in 2008 because reviewers said it was great for hard water areas. At the time we lived in the high desert in southern california and the water actually made our skin peel and break out. This shower head and timely replacement of the filters worked out great for us. It lasted exactly two years (at the time we paid $43 for it) before the adjustment ring broke. I turned it on recently and water was spraying out all around the ring. Sprite responded to my email quickly and offered for me to send it in for repair.This shower head has excellent water pressure and the three settings are just what you need without the useless ""rain shower"" type settings or massage settings so hard that no one ever uses them."
3,Bad reviews!! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,Ignore all reviews stating they used this product to filter hard water. All it does is remove chlorine. Idiot myself for not reading the description. Lesson learned.
2,"Great idea, but not durable","My wife loves the Sprite filtered shower heads/handles, and I've bought about ten of them. She says they make her skin much less itchy than regular shower heads. I don't notice any difference in how my skin feels, but the Sprite shower head performs well enough. My beef is the poor quality construction. The hose fittings look like metal, but they're really plastic. Consistently, either a hose fitting or the plastic handle has cracked and leaked after about a year of use. I haven't been able to find replacement parts, so I end up buying a new shower head every year. Because my wife likes them so much, I'll keep buying them (reluctantly) until a competitor comes out with a more robust alternative."
2,This is 3 adjustable settings NOT 5 SETTING!,"I bought this to replace my old Sprite Royale shower filter that broke in the handle area. Very dissapointed the description states there are 5 way adjustable settings for the shower. *5-Way Massaging Spray (Fine Mist, Fine/Full Spray, Full Spray, Full Massage, Massage Spray) NOT TRUE!! There are only 3 settings. Very dissapointed!! I miss my Fine/Full Spray!!!"
5,A Much Awaited Return!,"Ereth returns in this, the fourth book in the Dimwood Forest series. I am a fourth and fifth grade teacher. I have read the entire series to my students and they absolutely love it! The classic battle between good and evil and through it all, Ereth's wonderful, hilariously scathing view of all around him---except Poppy, of course! In this book, Ereth experiences all of the joys of parenthood, even if it was by accident! This book simply flows along. My students did not want it to end, and neither did I!"
4,Excellent workout course for beginners to intermediate,"This video really works. I've been following exactly as they said, and I notice my muscle is building incredibly fast. They are correct to emphasize form over how much weight you are using. I did work out when I was in college, stopped at age 27, and now am 45, so I did have a small base when I started. I also have eaten smartly my whole life. But following this course, I can see the muscle building quickly. I agree that patience and good form are the keys, as well as keeping tabs on your progress. I can see myself becoming quite developed using this workout routine. It's an excellent course for beginners."
4,A Dream without Reason,"There are only a few points to add to Micah Sisk's excellent review of this deserved but unacknowledged gem from 1976. First of all, the title is a French translation of King Crimson's legendary live bootleg. Secondly, Un reve may be the first true marriage between the clinical precision of electronic music and the fiery power of rock. Pinhas' guitar almost literally sounds like a mastadon in heat as it charges its way through a jungle of massive, mechanized percussion (Francois Auger) and violent synthesizers. Un reve is really the first in a long wave of albums that would come later that can be truly classified as ""Cold Wave,"" a legitimate precursor to such industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and Fad Gadget. In some ways, Un reve is Heldon's most important, most influential album (though not necessarily my personal favorite) and as such deserves at least some belated recognition for having gotten there first."
3,A bible,"This book is a must for anyone who intend to or managing. In this book, you'll find many ideas, cases an tools which could help you manage better."
5,Grease gun,"I'm an Operating Engineer, so I need to grease regularly. I'm honest in the fact, I'm lazy about the pump by hand and wanted a powered version. While it isn't a household name brand, the gun is mpore than effective and comes with an extra battery. I highly recommend this. The price was unbeatable as well, somewhere around $55 discounted on Amazon......"
2,Grease gun,"First use of the product the barrel flew off, dew to a defect with the threads. When greasing it is difficult to tell if any grease is flowing."
2,Batteries,I've had it for a year and the gun works fine but the batteries don't .At a year old they run down too soon. Have too take them to Batteries r Usto get them rebuilt for $46 each.
2,Less talk and more music would make this a 5 star CD,"Marian and Dizzy are beyound any doubt right up there with the greatest musicians. On this CD I think that they should talk less and play a whole bunch more. The CD is slightly over 57 min. long, there's only 41 min. of music. Need I say more?"
2,Watch the only good part on YouTube,Point de Fuite is a delightful 10-minute film about a nude high school geometry class. But the rest of the disc contains body dismemberments and other dreadful stuff you probably don't want in your house. Be content to watch the only good part on YouTube.
2,I have bought 4 of these...,"...and only 2 are still working. The other 2 simply died; one met its end rather suddenly and the other endured slow, ever-more creaking demise. Now I know nothing is perfect, but the ""service"" I received from Bionaire was so cavalier that I did not return the dead fans (they wanted me to jump through too many hoops) and simply decided to buy from them no more. Live and learn."
1,An inferior product,"I bought one of these in April, and put it into service in May. After less than 2 weeks use, it simply died. The remote worked, the little LED lights lit, but the fan didn't blow air. I returned it to the manufacturer (at my expense PLUS $10), and received a replacement about 3 weeks later. After just over 2 weeks use, the replacement died. I e-mailed the manufacturer, but received no response. Since I already have $70+ invested in the original fan plus shipping the first one plus $10, I'm thinking I may just chalk it up as a bad experience and cross Bionaire off my list of brands I would buy."
4,"""Cool"" Idea","My high rating of this product is due to it's design, multi-function remote, and power of the air stream. The only thing preventing me from giving it a ""5"" is I would have really liked to see a speed adjustment for the oscillator. I don't think this is nit-picky considering all of the other features it has."
2,stopped working after three months,"really space-saving, quiet, loved it until it just stopped working after only three months."
1,"As other reviews have stated, my fan died also.","I purchase this fan in April of 2003. In July of 2003 it suddenly stopped working. There are other reviews of this nature for this product, so I would not trust this manufacturer if you are in the market for a fan. I, personally, will not buy another product from this manufacturer."
1,Do not buy this fan,I bought this for 47.99 and it lasted one full summer and two months into the 2nd one before it died. I believe that it is over priced and not worth what I paid for it - I have replaced it with one from a discount store for 19.99 which has the same tower styling and also has a remote and is quieter - Save your money on this one
1,Do we have a quality control problem here?,"Like other reviewers, my fan conked out...after less than 3 months. Phooey. It's way too much trouble to box it up and send it back. So into the trash where it belongs."
1,Bionaire sells garbage,"I recently bought a tower fan from Bionaire. It looked pretty good in the store and was supposed to be quiet. It worked well for about a day and then got out of balance. I didn't even move the fan so I have no idea how it got out of balance. It is now two weeks old and it sounds like it is about to die. If I was selling a product that was this pathetic, I wouldn't put my company name on it."
5,Great book!,"I rank it up there with sci-fi books like ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Childhood's End"", ""2001"", ""I,Robot"", ""Advent of the Corps"" and more such space operas and high-tech stories! A definite must-read!"
3,A little disappointing,"It's tough for me to give Bruce Sterling a bad review because reading his Schismatrix so many years ago was such a wonderful and mind-blowing experience. The novel schismatrix is a little dated now, but it heralded a wave of exciting new sci-fi that explored today's developing technologies and extrapolated exciting new technologies that could not have been imagined in the golden age of sci-fi.But, nostalgia aside, this is just an OK book. A little paranoid, a little dismal, and a lot pessimistic. Typical Sterling actually, but the thrum of new ideas, the exploration of new possibilities is lacking in this one, perhaps because it is confined to the near present. My advice is to skip this one and read Schismatrix or his Islands in the Net (another favorite of mine) first."
1,I was completely confused,"This is the worst work of fiction that I have read in the last ten years. I picked it up after reading a short review in Wired. I should have known better. Mr. Sterling writes for Wired and thus _will_ get a good review for his work.The book has Dr. Vandever as a super computer scientist who is famous for his work on 'Grendel' (something like a secure Beowulf cluster.) The whole thing about finding the issue with the Keyhole 13 satellite, controlling a BBJ aircraft from the ground or building a giant ground-based laser to kill super-secret satellites feels so unreal and superflous. There is also this love-affair between Tony Carew and the Indian film actress that was kind of totally unecessary. Mr. Sterling used a lot of scientific works just for the sake of it. This book was a huge waste of my time. Please save your time."
1,In Short: Awful,"This is an awful book.Was there a ghost writer involved? Did Sterling turn his name into a brand, much like Tom Clancy? I really hope so. This is a worse read, than even the dreary NetForce books from brand Clancy. (And that is saying something).Awful storyline, awful characters, awful grasp of technology, awful love affair.Bruce what happened?"
1,Weak..A short story writ too long,"Overall, this was a disappointment. Either you like Sterling's prose or you don't. I happen to like it but this book is less than a novel that what seems like a long treatment for a novel. Plot points come and turn on a dime with little involvement of characters or even explaination. Bits and pieces sparkle with Sterling's take on things but these flashes are far and few in between. You really don't care that much about any of the characters and when the main protagonist goes through huge, mostly unexplained behavior shifts, you really don't care. I only kept reading it to the end just to see if Sterling would put him and the reader out of their misery. I think I'm going to have to re-read ""islands in the net"" to wash the bad taste of this one out of my mouth."
2,Where's the beef?,"A peculiar book. Sterling's descriptions of technological gadgets and governmental processes are convincing, but Zenith Angle seems to be missing some things. An obvious or compelling plot, for one - you can read 3/4 of the way through the book without figuring out what exactly is the point of the book. The characterizations are weird - a mixture of colorful, dull, and just plain odd. For a hundred or so pages it seems like it might be a good read, and then after a couple hundred pages more you realize you have just about run out of pages, and it hasn't become a good read yet.Each page is well written, but taken as a whole, the book's pages add up to surprisingly little."
1,Way below his usual form. Buy something else,"This was a real disappointment. I finished it just to see if anything decent would happen. It didn't.It's a poorly-constructed ramble of a dot-commer who moves into Federal government and foils a ""dastardly"" plot in the post 9/11 era - all rubbish. The plot moves in fits and starts. The main character is unbelievable. The bit about using spam as an energy source is utterly pathetic (I don't think that would count as a spoiler).To summarise, if you want a good read, check out Richard Morgan's ""Altered Carbon"" or ""Fallen Angels"", or Stephenson's Baroque Cycle."
1,Stay Away,"Bruce, man, I have to say this is your *worst* work ever. Someone wrote in another review that readers who have a background in the sciences or information technology will appreciate this book. If only that were true. Anyone who has a vague understanding of any technology will immediately be hit with the realization that just about nothing in this book has any grounding in reality.See, when you're writing typical science fiction, you can get away with some vague handwaving about certain techno-things accompanied by random jargon. But when you're talking about stuff that actually could exist - it falls very flat. Very. I mean, spam powered laser weapons?And the unbelievable characters - this guy who spends millions, perhaps billions, on a scientific facility to create a fixed in place weapon that he wants to sell for $750 million? Why not skim a little off the construction budget there, guy?Skip this one."
2,Bad writing,"He writes like he's trying to write paragraphs for an ADHD 12-year old. I gave up about 30 pages in, because the writing just mocks the reader's intelligence."
2,A short book that took forever,"I wook in the technical industry and watch a lot of Alias. When I heard that this book was about spies and IT, I went out and bought it. It is somewhat technical and he does become a ""spy"". But, I just kept waiting for it to get real interesting. It is the type of book you can get from the public library later on in life."
2,Very disappointing!,"I've come to expect a lot more from Bruce Sterling, starting with amazing shaper / mechanist universe, aka Schismatrix Plus. All his other works are very good, though none invoked in me the same sense of wonder. Reading ""Zenith Angle"" was shocking, knowing Bruce Sterling cannot be this awful! Mind you, this book ranks fine with most other populist crap printed today, but for Sterling to have his name associated with this book should be devastating! I am truly sorry that some of Sterling's peers, such as Gibson, Rucker and even Varley exhibit similar letdowns in their latest books. Perhaps they should consider being less of visionaries and more of simply good authors / writers. 3rd grade language, terrible charachterization, jerky story line and no excitement!"
1,Poorly written,"This has to be one of the most poorly written books that I have ever read. I didn't expect Shakespeare, but give me a break. It was difficult to read, making it hard to understand the ideas that the author was trying to convey."
4,Collection of 3-D cutouts for AD&D; get it for the cityguide,"This is the hardest module to find complete in the FR series. Why? Well, it's a boxed set; and, once you get the pieces out of the box (cut-up buildings and maps), they never go back in! It's almost impossible to find as a complete set. The module includes 12 different street layout patterns, and 33 buildings - you can create an entire town or city block in a single night! Also includes the outstanding 64-page city guide, with invaluable information for random encounters (useful in any campaign). Not just for the Forgotten Realms - this set is ideal if you play with miniatures in the game, or with BattleSystem!"
2,not really programmable,"I have been disap[pointed with this one--the buttons only allow you to choose high or low, and the times are already preprogrammed and cannot be altered. If you interrupt the times, it will not switch to warm. Also, as mentioned, the lid does not fit properly, and steam runs down the outside. I have burned several dinners in this one! I would return it if I could--I suggest you stick to the standard old Crockpot with no fancy gadgetry on the outside--a much better appliance."
2,Poorly Made,"After waiting for many weeks we received this smart looking unit .... There was however one major problem with our unit. The earthenware crock pot was poorly made and not only did heat escape from below but also steam from cooking escaped from above, where the glass top did not meet the rim of the pot. This resulted in hard to calculate cooking times and sometimes dry food. Rival also make a fully programmable Slow Cooker which allows you to input the exact time required. I prefer this. We may have just been unlucky but our unit had 'factory reject' written all over it."
1,So disappointed,"What a major disappointment. This is just not a good product. Feet feel off, bad taste when cooked on high, on and on and on. All Clad, should be all bad"
5,When I fall in love,The Lettermen are all about my high school years. Now one of the original Lettermen Jerry Paul (THE best singer of the three)lives in the 55+ beautiful community I live in. He does shows for us from time to time. He's Waaayyy cuter now at over 70 than he was then! He ends his show by standing on his head. He is such a doll. Shirl
3,Great Music,"This is great music. I can't help but wonder, did their hair really look like that, or was the photo touched up a bit? Great oldies!"
4,Lettermen - All time greatest hits,I like the Lettermen and their harmonizing type of songs. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of music.
4,Good stuff,Their versions of these songs sound their best on CD disk. Glad that I have it and highly recommend it if you like their music.
2,Great tunes but too few and with a mistake (1981 audio cassette),"I bought this used and old. The cover showed ""1981"" as the date, and the code S 1558A also appeared.Like other reviewers, I thought there were too few songs included.The quality was poor with plenty of distortions and volume dips, something I've seen in several old cassettes, probably the result of degradation with age. I generally avoid used cassettes now, but sometimes you can't get what you want on CD.One of the songs listed on the cover was not on the cassette. ""I Believe"" was missing, and in its place was a second track of ""The Way You Look Tonight"".I'm hoping to get the ""complete hits"" CD (28 tracks) for Xmas."
1,Poor sound quality,The folks that were responsible to ship this did a great job. The sound quality on the cd was horrible. It was so low (volume) that I could not hear it well at all.
4,Why not a COMPLETE BOX SET?,"I am a huge fan of this wonderful and talented group but for the life of me cannot understand why someone has yet to come out with a COMPLETE set of ALL their songs. This has been done for many other less talented performers and frankly were it available I would pay a huge amount of money to have all the songs together in a set of 20 or 30 CD's, or however many it would take."
4,the Lettermen : All Time Greatest Hits,"This also was an older brothers gift, I remember as a very young onethe name of the Lettermen....we had a few of their albums at home.... But like many things we've had over time, they disappear ! Thanks for the memories!"
2,A Not So Historical Novel,"Actually the tie-in to actual history is quite good, this period is something of a passion of mine and I haven't caught the author in a historical mistake yet. I particularly enjoy her characterization of Elizabeth I.On the other hand however her period detail is simply awful. The Duke of Norfolk's household is Victorian rather than Elizabethan. A nobleman would not have a housekeeper but a Steward for example and the servants would not eat in the kitchen but in hall. The use of first names by all and sundry is irritating, in those days a lady would call even her husband 'Master Stannard', and a man-servant would not be called 'Master Brockley'.Ursula herself is far too Nineties in her sensibility, especially in her attitude towards religion. Interesting as the mysteries are I simply cannot cope with the anachronisms."
3,Contemporary folk music,"The music here, while traditionally based, has got some very contempoarry production values attached to it. This doesn't have the distance of older, more earthy recordings of similar music; it's very clean, sharp and upfront.The songs themselves are a great capturing of a tradition, but it wasn't wholly my style. If you're looking for the accessibility of, say, ""Kama Sutra"" or the earthy tone of ""Gift of the Gnawa"", you'll find hints of it, but not quite the whole kick-back flavor you know. For peopel heavy into world music - especially Moroccan music - already."
5,I Have Recommended this Book to Every Reader I Know,"Ms. Domingue's use of language, paranormal science, actual biology, love, sex, understanding of relationships blends beautifully into a compelling, unusual love story that transcends even death. I have recommended it to every reader I know.Sarah Phelan, Author of Stay At Home"
3,If only the book was as exquisite as the cover art,"As a graphic designer, I'd like to give appropriate recognition to the artist who designed such a beautiful piece of cover art. The illustration and typography are terrific; the book is quite a lovely package. My hope was that the story within would be equally appealing. While the premise of the story was clever, the ultimate execution was rather flat. Overwrought word choices and phrasing, less than completely rendered characters, and a very uneven knitting together of the two plots are a few of the signs that this new author has more work to do. Editorially, I was suprised that there were so many typos. A disservice to the writer, and perhaps a sign that the manuscript was rushed to publication - unfortunate, as more editorial input would have helped refine the end product."
5,An enchanting read,"I've not read the Alice Sebold book that this keeps getting compared to, so my opinion comes from this book on its own merit. I found it enchanting, the prose as haunting as the title and story. The author has a distinct lyricism to her voice, and more than once, I fell head over heels with the sheer beauty of her prose. The story is structured much like The Time Traveler's Wife, with the narrative jumping back and forth in time - present tense used for Razi's living life and past tense used for her ghostly life in the present day. I never found it confusing, and the graceful way it's interwoven, revealing more and more of the characters' lives as it goes along, was masterful. The parallels between Razi's life and the young couple she ""lives"" with now only add another layer of loveliness to an already glorious tale. Loved it."
4,"Mystical, but the air maybe a tad too thin","After your demise imagine hanging around 'between' able to observe and even interact on a ghostly plane with those you knew in life. The book is beautifully written- an amazing first novel. A 4 because though some of the main characters such as Raziela were well drawn, others just didn't speak to me. There didn't seem strong enough foundation for the serious problem that seemed to just crop up between Scott and Amy, or for the resolution of same. I will say that Ms. Domingue can write great love scenes when so many authors fail with love scenes that are just icky or ridiculous. Ms. Domingue has written a truly unique ghost story. This book should be on best book lists."
3,parts were great,I had trouble following who was who and what was where initially but once I was able to get that right in my head I enjoyed the story. Parts had me in tears.
3,I Wanted to Love This Book....,"...But I didn't. The reviews were so good, and the premise of the book was so intriguing, I couldn't wait to read it. My primary criticism of the book was that it was choppy. I love books told with multiple narrators and different points of view. But because each ""chapter"" was was so short (usually just a few paragraphs), by the time the reader understands who's talking and whether they are in the present or the past, it's time to move on to another character.There were many enjoyable aspects though. The setting--New Orleans in the 20's, some memorable characaters--Razi and Etoile in particular. The writing was, at times, delicious, and the concept of being ""between"" was really thought provoking. There is a particularly memorable scene where Razi comes across a little girl who is ""between"" and helps guide her to a more legitimate death. Wow, what a scene.I wanted to love this book the way I loved the Time Traveller's Wife, but I didn't."
5,The Mercy of Thin Air,"I'm sure this book isn't for everyone, but I loved it. It's hard to figure out sometimes but I loved the ending too."
5,This story will haunt you,"I originally became familiar with this novel on an audio CD. I purchased the hard copy as a Christmas gift. Razzie's story will haunt you, but in a good way. It is simply unforgettable and fascinating. More than a love story, there are many layers to this novel."
5,Beautiful use of language...,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I happened to find it on my local bookstore's bargain shelf. Thinking it would be a light summer read, I discovered it goes much deeper. This is not some silly ghost story, but rather a beautifully written novel about the fragility of life and love. The author has written a touching and sensual story, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, it is obvious Domingue has a love of language. I love this book."
2,The Mercy of Thin Air,"This book was used for our book club. While it was not a big hit with some, others really enjoyed it. There was much discussion with many points of view and interpretations. I would still recommend it."
4,My Favorite,This book is in my top 3 Favorite books. It was so romantic and tradjic easy to get lost in the story. I read in on my luch breaks anytime I had free and was sad when it was over.
4,Lovely ending,"The story is about Razi - a woman who died in her early twenties (back in the 1920s) and now as a ghost follows the lives of living people to keep herself busy. The latest couple she chooses to haunts is dealing with marital problems and secrets that mirror those of her previous 'life.' As the story moves forward we see the couples history/story unfold in parallel with Razi's own. At the center of each is a love story and a loss story.I struggled at time to read this because it is told in very, very short chunks. Sometimes they were a page and a half. Sometimes they were half a page. I felt like I was just getting into something when we'd switched to a different time and storyline. It felt choppy.However the story/stories themselves very much drew me in. And the surprise ending (which ties Razi to the living couple) was so unexpected that I literally laughed out loud. Then for the next few pages I cried, because it was all so touching."
2,Where was the editor???,"I have to confess I found this a laborious read. The concept was good -- highly creative -- but, the writing? Yikes. Whoever edited this manuscript did an injustice to the author as well as the reader. From people putting things ""on the ground"" instead of on the floor (Huh??? When did they go outdoors???), to anachronisms, to some of the most bizarre useages imagineable, I have never been so distracted from a story by it's language. The line that put me on the floor giggling was a scene where the dead girl's ex and her dad are commiserating and both men ""mash"" their forearms to their eyes. Good lord. What an image!"
3,Meh...,"As others here have said, I so wanted to like this book. Premise sounded great, I love that time period, it should have been a 5-star read for me. The sample was good and I bought the book. I was close to halfway through it when the other books on my to-be-read list started beckoning me. I read one book at a time; it's never a good sign when I am only halfway through a book and already yearning to read a, well, good book. I realized that I just plain didn't care what happened to those characters. It had become convoluted and confusing and was moving at a glacial crawl, and I didn't relish the idea of putting days of good reading time into finishing it. So I abandoned it, something I very rarely do with purchased Kindle books. (And btw, the next book I read was fantastic.)"
5,young love,"This is such a sweet movie! It brings back everything, the good and the bad, about being young and hopelessly in love. The actors do a wonderful job."
1,Don't buy Blu-Ray if you have an Oppo Blu-Ray player (even w/ latest firmware). This disc will not play beyond menu,"My Oppo BD-83 blu ray player has never hit a snag in six months of use (even when I was using it during their beta program, it played all DVD's and Blu-Rays). Then it met ""Summer."" The disc started to play a trailer and halted in the middle. Then it jumped to the main menu. There, despite hitting every ""play"" and/or ""select"" button on the remote to advance, it would do nothing except provide the universal circle with the red line through it on the upper left screen. I tried close to 10 times, reloading and so on. Nothing worked. I double-checked live to the Internet for the latest firmware updates. But my player is up to date. When I tried another disc, the player briefly had a problem until I restarted everything again. My player definitely did not like Summer or whatever Fox has put on this disc that is causing the problem. Beware."
1,WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST BLUE RAY PLAYERS,Thank God the company was generous and refunded me plus a free shipping back
1,500 days of not funny!,this movie was misrepresented as being a romantic comedy when in fact it was sappy melodrama. About the only funny part of this movie was the very end.
2,Why is the standard DVD being released 2 weeks after the Blu Ray?,This was one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years. I just don't understand the logic of the Blu-Ray being released on December 22 and this being released January 5th!!!
5,A great sleeper hit,"I went into this movie expecting it to be a dumb sappy love story and I have never been so happy to be proven wrong, If you've ever experienced any romantic troubles in your life then you'll immediately be able to connect to this movie. The cast meshes perfectly together, the scenes are well planned and the occasional jokes are always good."
1,Save your money,So I thought I would get this movie as it looked like a chick flick and from time to time I get one to see with my wife during the evening as a treat to her. I usually view them first. After about 15 minutes of watching this my mind was so numb that it rebelled and I had to shut it off and do something stimulating like doing my taxes which as you can imagine is like wanting to pull out your fingernails. This gives you some idea of how much I liked this movie.Ken
1,Didn't work.,"I got the case, which seemed fine. I opened the case to find a very strange looking DVD. The front was labeled (500) Days of Summer, and I don't doubt that it was the right disk, but...The back of the disk was completely warped. It was bumpy and strange looking, almost twisted, yet the disk wasn't out of shape. Needless to say, it didn't work."
1,Worst Movie,"If i am asked what is my least favorite movie, then this is the one i say. I can't find anything positive to say about this movie. It jumps back and forward so many time that your head is spinning and your completely lost. I'm just very sorry i wasted my money on this."
1,Time we will never get back . . .,"How do I start with describing this crappy movie? Romantic comedy - huh? The movie was trying so hard to be interesting and not be a formulaic movie that it ended up being a choppy mess. The whole movie seems like it was shot underwater and the dialog and plot seem to have been written by children. Seriously, I wanted to like this movie . . . my wife and I had been waiting for it to come out on Amazon Downloads so we could rent it. Too bad we won't ever get that time back. Yuck! If you HAVE to watch this movie, you will understand why I gave it 1 star. Decent soundtrack, so perhaps just buy the CD Soundtrack and skip the movie."
1,I find this movie to be rather dull.,"It was like watching one long 2 hour conversation between two people. If I wanted that, then why would I watch a whole movie about it?"
4,Reality Bites should be the title of this movie,"Tom Meets Summer, a girl who is independant and isn't looking for anything serious in a relationship. Add 500 days and you have the ups and downs of a relationship told in a realistic way thats not too sugar coated by many love stories. kind of a sad movie but the ending I felt was rewarding for both charectors, I know some reviewers expected something else but I thought it was handled well. A good movie to deal with a breakup."
4,500 Days of Summer,"`500 Days of Summer' is kind of an anti-love story and follows Tom, who is a greeting card writer, when he falls in love with Summer. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer doesn't believe in love and as he falls deeper and deeper under her spell, she moves further away. This the basic premise but if offers up slightly more than that. This has a slight down beat, mildly melancholy, feel to it and although it has funny moments throughout and I laughed at numerous points, it has a poignancy not hinted at in the trailers. It also has a great soundtrack, which features The Temper Trap, which only adds to the film. Both main actors play their parts well and there are some unique and stylish direction techniques used. This makes for 90 minutes entertaining viewing and as long as you don't expect a full on comedy, you should enjoy this a great deal.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Lighthearted Romance,"The two stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (from Third Rock TV Show) and Zooey Deschanel (Failure to Launch) are almost too good for this film. They are great characters and the movie is funny. Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is the star. He writes and creates greeting cards but has higher aspirations. Tom wants to be an architect. Zooey is Summer, a sweet and beautiful quirky girl. The film goes back and forth in time, and we see a complicated relationship, often troubled with some communications problems. It is typical romantic piece, and satisfyingly fun to watch."
2,I don't get it,"I don't understand what the point is.Sure, you're told straight off the bat ""this isn't a love story"". But Summer is so flat despite her quirks and enigmatic-y-ism that when she finally makes her decision I didn't really care about her happiness. I don't want to give anything away, so that's all I can say.There was some interesting stuff going on in the main man's story, but his ""revelation"" about his work wasn't really that fair, so it also falls flat. You do feel for him, though.YMMV. For me, it was a waste of time."
2,Disappointed.,"I was expecting something special given the great critic reviews and user reviews. I found the female lead character unlikeable and unsympathetic. Movie should be rated R, definitely not for children - a number of unnecessarily vulgar scenes are included."
4,Refreshing movie ! Love it !,I bought the blu-ray version of this movie and I love it! It's a movie about a man searching for his soul mate and the obstacles he faces in his relationship. This story is told from the perspective of a man which is refreshing! This is definately not your typical relationship story. This movie is definately worth watching more than once. If youre into love stories and relationship movies then get this movie pronto!
5,great movie,"This is a great movie I loved the performances, and the script, I've watched it over 5 times already :)"
3,500 Days...,"Purchased as gift for my daughter. She keeps raving about this movie. So... finally I check Amazon and, of course, they had it available. Received in a very short time and just in time to be a great stocking stuffer.Can't give a review on movie, yet. But, plan to watch over the Christmas holiday.Happy Customer"
3,There's actually a lot to this movie but almost none of it was developed.,"This was a fun movie, but not very good. Above average music, acting, story, and production values, but that's not saying much I guess... nothing to be embarrassed about if you're caught watching this, but not much to be proud of. There were nice touches through-out, but partly the main man was a bit fake, partly it was all just outside my income bracket so I couldn't relate very well, and then there were a lot of 5 and 10 and 30 second cuts that were fluff.Of course the leading lady is hot hot. And all the fluff... those are good moments to squeeze your date's hand, or something other than a hand, and make out.I was actually worried this movie would be packed with clever ideas for getting and keeping the girl, but it really wasn't. The IKEA one was nice. But, well, again, I just wasn't the target audience for this one."
4,"Sweet, quirky ""not a love story""","Other reviews here have pretty much covered the waterfront. This is a charming little movie that's both inventive and engaging. The two leads do a fine job of bringing their characters to life, and anyone who's ever been through the ups and downs of unrequited (or barely-requited) love will feel Tom's frustration. Not quite a 5-star move - more like 4.5 stars - but definitely worth watching with someone you love."
4,Great editing and wity humor.,Rented this movie for a day on the Video on Demand and the quality was amazing and the video itself was better than expected. Subtle humor was nice to see and the story line was really easy to keep along. Would definitely recommend watching this movie.
4,Required viewing for women who think guys are heartless,"This film is 4-stars not 5, but its primary success is exemplary: portraying the pain of a guy whose girl remains elusive. Such a role reversal is uncommon for the modern chick flick, but it's not played just for that novelty -- it's played for the reality of the emotion involved. 500DoS should be required viewing for women whose experiences have them believing men incapable of caring. Tom cares - and pays, and pays, and pays.SPOILER: I thought the ending was more than a bit of a cheat. I don't remember what ""Day number"" (post-Summer) ended the film, but a guy like Tom would probably grieve quite awhile before reaching out toward a new girl (particularly a stranger), and even after he started again, his first few such advances would probably fail. To give him a quickie happy ending, starting off again post-Summer with a shot at a new relationship, felt tacked-on."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This movie was a lot better than I expected with the out of order sequence of scenes. Joseph Gordon Levitt was good for the first time in a decade and Zooey Deschanel was phenomenal as always. What makes her performances great is her uniqueness, the fact that nothing she says or does is what one would expect. The ending could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall it was good."
4,500 days of summer,"i found the movie to be very good and enteraning..and would buy again ,and would recomend as a good adition to any colocten"
5,Engaging and entertaining,"This is a very sweet, slightly off-beat movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it highly! The acting was believable and writing was great."
3,Too much hype with no Hip.,"I heard all the fuss about this movie when it was in theatres. Not much of a love story if you ask me. The actors are adorable and just watching them is fun by itself, but this movie is not what everyone claims it to be. Its not The Notebook, and there is just too much angst, confusion, and separation for this movie to be considered a love story."
4,Good life movie,"Good movie with surprising ending, not your typical hollywood love story. Good price, easy to view via Vizio TV with Amazon app."
5,One of my,favorite movies for the year. Was surprised that I liked it so much... could have been because of Zooey.. :-)
5,500 days of wonderful,"500 days of summer is one of the best movies ive seen in a while. its so funny and down to earth, this is the story of every man or woman in the dating pool. you may come out of it with negative feelings or not like it at all, but you will have to admit that it was well written and you connected to the characters enough to form a strong opinion."
4,Cute movie,"Cute movie, a little bit annoying trying to keep track of the different time periods, but once you give that up and just enjoy the movie it's pretty nice."
3,A Very Different Movie,"While unique is sometimes interesting and even enjoyable, I found this movie to be interesting but not particularly enjoyable or entertaining. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a very good actor and his subsequent movies bear that out he seems to me to be alomost disengaged in this role. If you want to see a quirky odd piece then you might like it, if quirky and odd is not what you are looking for, pass this one by."
4,A Very Unique Film,"I kind of had a sense in the direction this film would go, as the narrator at the beginning kind of spoiled it and gave me a heads up. And this isn't your typical boy-meets-girl romance comedy (if it can even be described as a romance film to begin with), nor is it really a comedy at all. It's more of a drama about love and loss, and being able to pick up the pieces of your life when things don't go quite as planned. What made this movie stand out, though, was the way certain scenes were filmed, which did well to convey the emotions of Tom Hansen's expectations and the reality of the world around him. No, this is not a masterpiece, and the film is indeed flawed by constantly shifting back and forth between days (the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5), but this was definately one of the better dramas I have seen for quite a long while."
3,"OK movie, but digi download doesnt work anymore","If youre getting the bluray version for the digi download your getting ripped off. The movie itself is ok. Different, sad and funny. It just felt like it was missing somthing."
2,Don't waste your time!,"This movie was awful. I spent the whole movie trying not to hate the main female character, only to find out in the end I might as well have hated her. It was terrible. I think even if the movie had wrapped up neatly with a happy ending and a bow I still would not have liked it because the characters were in no way likable. I couldn't even relate to them and say ""yeah, I might have done that too."" Please don't waste your time."
2,500 days of Summer,The movie 500 days of summer was the movie that was really bad movie I didn't enjoy it at all should be destroyed I am glad I didn't buy it
5,500 Days of Summer,"Although sad, I like this movie. Lesson for all - take a risk. When you want something, go for it before it's too late!"
4,Speaking of preferences,"Young female flirts with an office co-worker-young architect just to wear a ring similar to one her female friend does and marry a guy (supposedly) even much less interested in a regular sex than her ousted young-teen-sister-consulted buddy is.No worries, an architect hangs around with at least two lads interested each in other more than in their reproducing.I really like acting by actors playing the major roles."
2,not a happy story,"I have been on a waiting list for months and when I got it I was in the mood for something heart warming smart movie. I wish someone would have told me that this is not a happy movie. Through most of the movie we see the couple falling in love and falling apart. I have meet lots of girls like Summer, and I hate them. They use guys and tell them they are going to do it, and than keep pulling guys in for the kill. I hated waiting that again on the TV screen.I loved the acting and the writing. If I had gone into this movie know that it was going to be a downer but interesting, than I would have been ok with it. But Light warming and fun it was not."
2,Artsy references do not make for depth.,"I repeat my title: artsy references do not make for depth. Neither does a non-linear time frame, even if it is meant to evoke the way memory functions. With as common a theme as he loves her/she loves him not, this should be a character driven drama to make the audience feel the emotional conflict. The characters are too thinly drawn here to evoke that response. Honestly, I knew more about Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the red headed girl from Charles Schulz's four panel cartoons than I do about the leads in this movie. The direct camera interviews seem formulaic after TV shows like ""The Office."" The narrator seems more like an apologist for this unsympathetic love affair than an omniscient voice. The only reason I am giving this mediocre movie two stars is the charismatic lead actors. I would like to see Zoey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in something more worthy of their talent. (And per other reviews I read, this is no comparison to ""Annie Hall."")"
5,It was just as I remembered it!,"I have very few positive memories of my childhood. One of the few is of a copy of this book. It lived on a small desk in a back room, and I would sit and read it over and over when I needed to get away for a bit.This copy is exactly the same. It was in beautiful condition. Thank you."
2,Mediocre at best,"I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, particularly if you have ever done any other sort of gardening. The entire book can be summed up in a couple of sentences - Put the seeds in some dirt and keep them watered. The end.It can be charming at times, as Perper often waxes poetic about the joys of fresh fruits, how nice it is to smell the aromatic leaves of a lime tree, etc., etc. But, unless you really go for Reader's Digest sweety-sweet stuff, or you've never gardened before and need reassurance about how easy it is, I wouldn't pay more than 25 cents at the used bookstore bargain bin for this one."
5,Trisha touched my heart with her honesty,"It's hard to get a copy of Trisha's ""drive"" when you live in Holland like me. When I finally did, I jumped in the passenger seat and couldn't stop reading. I feel connected. Her honesty moves me. Reading her thoughts, experiences and feelings helps me to stay on my track. Thank you Trisha."
1,"As an avid Naiad reader, I found this to be a disapointment","I was very disapointed in this book. It rambled on and went nowhere. I finished the book because I had paid for it, but that was the only reason. The discription of this book lead me to believe it would be great, but it was anything but. I could hardly believe anyone would drive 1700 miles in the dead of winter only to turn around and go back the next day. It was aptly named ""The Drive"" because that's all it was about. There was very little about character development,"
4,No title,"A friend of mine recently suggested that I read 'The Drive'. I'd never heard of Todd, but thought it might be interesting. It did read like a journal and yes, a journey. But to where?After living many years as a part of the 'lesbian community' I share what appeared to be her frustrations where finding the 'right' woman were concerned. I applaud her for her honesty. She allowed the reader to see a sadness too often seen in our world where many Annies & Danielles exist.An exploration of each attempt & failure with a reassessment along the way to perhaps to qualify the effort.By book's end, I was still uncertain as to how much she'd learned about herself, beyond her obvious need for spirituality.Perhaps that was it. Have faith in where you are going. Fate promises a fun filled ride. Just make sure to pay attention along the way.I hope to see more from her"
4,Good Drive,"A speedy read, could not put it down, driving fast to the resolution. Well written and graphically enjoyable for those of us who have been there."
4,"Nice Ride-Not out of touch, very real.","The funny thing is that I read this novel on my commute to work every morning. What I loved about this book is it's real. I really long for lesbian orientated novel that are contrived or too on the edge in the character's lifestyle that I can't connect. I could connect with this book. I even think that I think a bit like the narrator, including driving to far for love. There is some personal stuff, I think, about Trisha Todd, which is kinda nice, if you ever wondered what she was up to. I guess that really helped the book become more real. Get it if you want a read that you don't have to say,""aw come on about."""
5,I feel the pain of everyone. . . then I feel nothing!,"This book could have been about me, but without the driving. I could not stop crying as I read the last pages. I felt the author's pain as my own. Her Annie is my Michelle, and I wonder how many others like us are out there. I am numb again as the memories crash in. ""The Drive"" is a lament for love lost. I loved it!"
4,"lonestar's ""Lonely Grill""","This c.d. was great! Although, there were a few songs they could have left out. They added new spice to this c.d.. They seem to have fallen back in love with their country fame. They put on a great tour for this c.d. though. Go Lonestar!!"
3,A little bit crazy...,"This one is a little bit crazy and hard to follow at first. If you can get used to a slow start, you'll eventually be hooked. There is a lot to pay attention to at the beginning and I don't love that. It reads like a journal, which is also kind of a courtroom drama. It's good, but not Daniel Handler's best."
4,teen diary?,"It starts as a teen girl diary but written in a style that is strangely appealing so that I found myself caught up in the story.Story Telling has been described as an Art: one must capture attention and lead the listener down new paths, Well the author has doe that. I won't tell you plot or the end, but knowing the author also wrote 'Lemony Snicket' gives one the knowledge that things will go in unexpected paths. There is drama, comedy and more. After a few pages the diary style becomes a normal prose style with quoted speech and narrative joined as in the standard novel form. Read This!"
5,Hilariously Moving,"I could not believe how much I loved this book. I knew Daniel Handler was funny from his Series of Unfortunate Events, but this book binges on black comedy, to great effect. I did see the big twist coming (not the ""who dies"" twist) about halfway through the book, but I enjoyed the shock of the reveal nonetheless. Definitely requires a second read, it's that good!"
5,"I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants!!!!!","Handler's keen insights into teen angst and despair are completely enthralling. It's funny, it's gory, and it's great at parties."
3,"interesting book, but a stretch","Overall, I thought the book was pretty good for Handler's first outing. The characters and story were developed nicely. I only had 2 real problems with the book. First, as has been pointed out by others here, there are too many inconsistencies. While one could argue that they simply reflected Flan's view of things rather than reality, I think that a copout and doesn't explain away all or many of the inconsistencies. Second, I thought that the story would have been more appropriate if it took place in a smaller city or town. Given San Francisco's liberal and metropolitan mentality, it's hard to believe the perspectives and actions of many of the characters in the book. I guess he used San Francisco since the high school he was parodying is in San Francisco, but why bother if you're not going to actually use the real San Francisco. Otherwise though, I generally liked the book. It had me reflecting on my days at Roewer."
3,Former Lowell Student from Handler's class,"Was thrilled and shocked by the journey back to high school. Handler captures the setting so perfectly that at times I had to put it down and go back to my adult life. Handler doesn't really bother to change anyone's name (or identity), except only slightly. How has he avoided the lawsuits? The humor was excellent, the setting and the tone were dead ringers, but the ending was too long. However, I can't wait to read his next work."
2,"Cute Words, Thin Satire, Ugly Story","It is hard being smart in high school as illustrated in this novel: a high-school senior in a clique of smart kids gets into trouble, big trouble, and murder trouble. The clever language and thin satire are hard to perceive, much less appreciate, being smothered in foul language, graphic sex, and the profane, making this novel unsuitable for high-school students (though it is on some YA lists) and undesirable for most other humans. Are there good ideas or wisdom here? How can one tell?If you are squeamish about what you read or otherwise limit the foul language, sexual content, or ravings against religion in your reading, then you will want to skip this novel."
2,A mediocre first effort,"Why is it that if someone doesn't like a book there's always a crowd of people who insist those readers ""just didn't get it""? I have discussed this book with many ""intelligent and engaged"" readers who had justifiably critical things to say about it. The book has funny parts, particularly those dealing with the inanities of high school life, but apart from the narrator the characters are flat, unappealing, and nauseatingly pretentious. I look forward to reading something by the author that isn't partly autobiographical, since for whatever reason he doesn't appear capable of distancing himself enough from the subject matter to write a truly brilliant parody. And for all the big deal about the ""surprise twist"" at the end, I thought it was pointless, since by the time I reached it I couldn't have cared less about the characters anymore. This book is most definitely a one-time read."
2,Even with all the outlandish praise given here: 2 stars,"Sometimes I wonder who is writing the reviews on Amazon. The author's friends? The editor? The agent? The writer's family? True, there's a lot of good laughs in this book, and a lot of very engaging moments. But I certainly would not recommend running out and buying it as soon as you can, or reading over and over again. It's an enjoyable read, but come on, guys, this isn't exactly William Shakespeare."
3,I liked this amusing book. A fun and easy read.,"I heard about and read The Basic Eight because I attended the same high school as Daniel Handler. I'm not a friend of his. He didn't dissapoint with this book. I enjoyed The Basic Eight. I thought it was an entertaining, witty satire of the high school experience. I do wonder why he veiled names so lightly... Nevertheless, I laughed out loud several times, agreeing with DH's oddly trivial but right-on observations such as the first-day-of-school-cover-your-books phenomenon. (Like another commenter, I missed my bus stop reading this book.) It's also been an interesting conversation piece in light of recent events. I am looking forward very much to Daniel's next book."
2,"An easy read, and mostly fun","It was fun reading this, but was silly and a kind of vapid at the same time. Good but not great."
3,5 stars....I don't get it...,Not a bad book but not great. It has funny bits and if you went to high school with these people (I did...Los Angeles WESTSIDE high schools back in the 80's...those of you from Los Angeles know what that means...for everyone else...Bev Hills 90210...Clueless...those kids are real ;)...that being said...it's an OK summer read but you will be able to put it down...and you don't need to read it again...
1,Could not finish it no matter how hard I tried!,"The first three-quarters were readable but filled with irrelevancies. The last quarter was far too long, with a so-called twist that I could see coming from a mile off. I hated all of the characters and really would have liked it much more had they all unexpectedly died in an Earthquake.I gave up and tried to read the end expecting some fulfillment but did not even finish the last page because it was more drivel."
2,Sloppy and annoying,"The best thing about this book, to me, is how encouraging it is for the aspiring novelist: you too may be able to copy the central premise of a much more popular novel (published a scant three years before your own, and now a box office hit), include two pages of exposition per chapter, make sideways pop culture references, mix realism and silly faked celebrity names, mix realism and nonsense cultural geography, and talk about the weather in almost every scene! And get published, to great acclaim!I mean. Screw literature, I'm going to start writing kids' books."
4,I can't stop thinking about it...,"... and it's been a while since I've read a book that had this effect on me. Flannery Culp, high-school senior, belongs in a group of friends. They call themselves the Basic Eight, hence the title. It seems like an innocent clique, but what happens when a guy named Adam State appears and starts drinking up Flan's heart? What happens when a ... biology teacher takes advantage of Flan? What happens when Flan realizes that the Basic Eight aren't exactly who they seem to be? That's for me to know, and you to find out.Handler's masterful use of black humor and heartwrenching writing is not to be missed. The Basic Eight is a book different than other books, and I would not hesitate to recommend it. It keeps you thinking long after you've finished it- is this a good thing? Discuss."
5,"Very, very witty!","You'll either love it or hate it, but you have to admit that it was incredibly well-written. (if you hate surprises, this is not the book for you.) Yes, the heroine is self-centered, a snob, and you probably won't like her very much, but even though this is written as her diary, the author's sarcasm and twisted sense of humor shines through to expose her. Hilarious. I'm using it for a discussion group..."
4,Rare interview,"Mancini is not a fascinating talker, but interviews with him were pretty rare. He's quite honest about what his music was, and the two of them playing together is fun. What else is Mancini's music about?"
3,Adequate at best,"There can be no denying that Henry Mancini was a major force in American popular music. His beautiful TV and motion picture themes are touching, inspiring and timeless. Unfortunately those characteristics didn't seem to carry over into his personality and he was a surprisingly bland conversationalist. When Marian asks him how he got into composition he tells her he has no idea. When she asks him how he came to write the Pink Panther Theme he replies, ""What else would you write for a Pink Panther?"" Not terribly enlightening. Between the two of them they perform eight Mancini compositions. Given the talent of the pianists involved they are all performed proficiently, but Mancini's music is best served by a full orchestra as it was intended. There's plenty of name dropping throughout this program (which was recorded in 1985) but not much insight into the man. If you buy it you'll probably enjoy parts of it, just don't expect any major revelations."

4,A good software gift,A good software for a little brother who is into movies. There are not a lot of options without spending a ton of money but this proved to be pretty cool for him. Good quality!
5,The best childrens book ever published,"I don't know if this review is what you are looking for, but bear with me for a moment. When I was 8 or 9, my teacher assigned reading projects to my class, she assigned to half of the class ""Black Beauty"" and to the other half ""Wind in the willows"". I fell in the ""Wind"" half, and was quite honestly, disappointed (to say the least). However, as a slightly older and more read observer, I can't thank that teacher enough, for allowing me to find out what magic, words can evoke. ""Wind in the willows"" should be required reading for every young person entering the world. I am convinced that my love of the written word, devolves from this wonderful narative. I am buying it for my grandchildren this very evening. The use of language to paint scenes and moods is unseen and unknown in most of todays literature. This is quite simply a wonderful entre to a life time of appreciation of literature. BUY IT FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN."
5,A magical classic,"I just revisited this wonderful story, after reading during my childhood and to my children when they were young. It has lost nothing of its magic for me. Mole, Ratty, Mr.Toad, and Mr. Badger are loveable and timeless in their appeal to young and old."
4,The wind in the willows,This is a very good book it is a bit hard to understand but otherwise there is nothing wrong with it.
5,Great classic!,"When I first read it, I was too little to fully appriciate it. I recomend it for ages 8 and up. A must read, It is a great story. You really must read it."
3,A strange mix but entertaining,"A children's classic that escaped my childhood readings, I read this as research for a short story I did.A rich vocabulary with a strange mix of sometimes natural and sometimes human characteristics for the animals, the short sections were enjoyable and fast paced.I think I prefer either the simpler Pooh stories or the more complex Watership Down, however."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I enjoy most classic childrens' stories and I relive my youth when I read them. I was disappointed when I read this book because the characters were not very likeable. Mr. Toad seemed to have everyone wrapped around his finger; his sad puppy eyes seemed to allow him to get away with everything. I was hoping one of the characters would stand firmly against him and not eventually give in to his whims. Even though this book is fantasy, I had trouble believing that Toad could look like a human washerwoman. It was also strange reading about the animals sitting down to dinner to have ham, pheasant, rabbit, etc. Basically, I thought the author could have been more imaginative about how the animals interacted with the humans in the story. The ending was also a little unbelievable considering Mr. Toad's character. The redeeming factor of the book is the writing style and the vivid images of nature."
1,The Wind in the Willows,"Horrible -- never got it to work. Downloaded, could not load in any of the formats on my droid or google play or kindle. Don't waste your time on the bandwidth pulling down this."
3,"Good for children, but if your an adult buy another book.","I was looking for a fanciful animal fantasy so I bought the book. Unfortunatly the book was a little to childish for my tastes. A warning for anyone who is thinking about buying the book: The animal characters and humans all act as if they are one and the same. If a toad came up and spoke to me I would freak out! That's my main flaw with the book. I guess I was expecting something more in the vain of ""Watership Down""."
5,The Wind in the Willows,I am very happy with the people who work for this company... The first copy was lost so I contacted them and a book was sent out that day and I got it in 2 days. Now that is CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS BEST. Thank you. I will tell everyone I know to get books from this company.
1,disappointed,"i love the cover, but in the ""product description"" it says that there are beautiful colorful illustrations. not the case. first, they are black and white and tiny and second, they are not by micheal hague!"
1,voice,"Planned to download the audio version for a car ride with my 9-year old grand-daughters. Unfortunately, the narrator's voice is flat, not nuanced enough to do justice to the wonderful story about to unfold.I'll read it to them myself."
5,Greatest book ever!,"Many people consider this book a children's book. But I, along with many other fans of this book would totally disagree. This book has incredible imagery in the writing. I consider this book a movie the writing is so good. I'm not really looking at words but I'm rather seeing the words. This is by far my favorite book. Even better than Tolkien (my second favorite author). Kenneth Graham has created a wonderful world with unique places like the River Side, Toad Hall, and the Wild Woods just to name a few. I recommend this book to all ages. It's even Theodore Rossevelt's favorite book."
5,A treasure,"This classic book has been one I've come back to for 40-plus years for it's stories, it's characters and it's wonderful story-TELLING. As uproarious as Toad's madcap adventures are, though, it's probably the story of Ratty and the sweet-natured Mole's adventure in the Wild Wood and their subsequent return to Mole's little home that resonate most with me. This is a book to be read over and over."
2,Dull,"I was so excited to finally read this classic, and I feel terrible that I found it so dull. I read lots of book to my son I homeschool. We read all levels, but he didn't like it either. I didn't read the whole book. I got about half way until I just couldnt' read it any longer. But, so many people love this book, so if you have never read it go check it out at the library before buying it. I think people either love it or hate it."
2,Might be great for children,It was about a mole who takes a trip with a river rat and meets other animals. I found it boring.
3,"Story endures, so should the illustrations","The story is preserved, thank goodness, as some other publishers I won't mention have modernized the story--making it PC, American, and otherwise awful. The art, however, has been redone when there was no need to redo it. While the current pictures are acceptable, they are not as appealing as the Smallman illustrations in the copy I own. I know artists need to make a living, too, but couldn't they stick to illustrating new books instead of messing about with books that already have perfectly fine illustrations? Please?"
2,book store sent me the wrong edition,"One of the classic children's book, but the best illustrations are by Rackham. The book store sent me the wrong edition, and put me in a useless loop when I tried to return it."
5,A delightful children's story that captures the imagination.,"The Wind in the Willows is a delightful tale that captures the imaginations of children and adults. The adventures of Mr.Badger, Toad, Mole and Ratty are skillfully presented in a way that the reader can identify with. The illustrations enhance the tale and help the mind create the scenes described. This book can be enjoyed by the young and the young at heart."
3,"Wonderful idea, poor writing","I had a perhaps overly-romantic urge to have my son read this book, and quickly remembered why I myself never finished it as a boy. The sentences are long and stodgy, difficult, almost Victorian (if that makes sense), and easily frustrate even a hardcore young reader who wants to please his father.We gave up. That makes me sad. I don't demand that good children's literature be simplistic, because what would be the point? I do, however, expect good writing. This is really not very good writing.Perhaps my son said it best: ""I think it's British."""
5,"Delightful, charming, and beautifully written...","I read this book for the first time two years ago, and it is one of my all-time favorite books - which I re-read now every spring. I owned this edition. I say ""owned"" in the past-tense, because I am buying it now... for the third time... to replace yet another copied loaned out and loved too much to be returned to me!This is a delightful story, whether you are a child tucked into bed and being read to, or whether, like me, you are the adult with your feet tucked up beneath you in some quiet, sunny spot. There are moments in this book that are so charming, so profound, or so amusing, that I find myself re-reading the passages again and again, and just laughing."
5,Great for all ages,"I never read this when I was a child, but saw the Kindle price of ""Free"" so I could not resist.What a great book. The language is incredible. Some of his descriptions of the scenery is just amazing, you can almost smell the flowers and feel the wind.I highly recommend this for all ages.If you read it as a child then rediscover it again with a child or grandchild. both of you will be happy you did."
5,A must read for children and some adults...,"From the first time TWITW was read to me by my mother (about 30 years ago) to my most recent read of TWITW, I have always loved this book. I have read TWITW over 25 times in my 38 years, and each time it touches a chord in my heart. Very few other books that I have read create such beautiful mental imagery for me of the wonders of nature and leave me feeling so spiritually refreshed. This is probably not a book that should be read indiscriminately to very young children, but it is wonderful for school-age children and for adults that still know what it feels like to be a child. Although the animals throughout the book are treated as humans, this does not detract from the overall feel of the book, but rather adds to the childlike delight I feel everytime I read it. If I was to have to discard my 1000's of books, this would be one of the last ten to go. If you are a child (or are an adult that has not lost all of your innocense) TWITW is a must read."
5,"O, how charming!","At 22, I'm just reading for this for the first time, and I love it. There's something about losing yourself in the world of fussy and friendly little animals with startling personalities--I wish more books were written like this. I'd reccommend it for older children, maybe 9-13, and up, because the language can be difficult. But everyone will love the story, so read it aloud, read it to yourself, read it read it!"
5,A Classic Barn-Find,"While reading a biography of C. S. Lewis, I learned he was very fond of this story. I vaguely remember its being a classic from my childhood and decided to read it for myself. This is one of those stories (like The Pilgrim's Progress) that virtually everyone had read a hundred years ago, yet it is almost unheard of by today's population. A worthy classic for young readers that should be read by many more. It's like Tom Sawyer and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - too good to let slip away into oblivion."
3,Children's story,"This is a story written for children. I honestly don't know whether this story would appeal to a child, but it seemed too cloyingly sweet to me.It's a classic, which is the reason why I read it in the first place. I found the plot subservient to the descriptions of the way the animals live in their cute and cozy world, which did not endear me to the book.It is quite possible that children will love this book for its imaginative drawing of a world where animals live as people. But, unlike other classics, such as ""Narnia"", ""Peter Pan"" or ""Five Children and It"", this one is not worth reading as an adult."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I never received this book. I submitted a previous review on the seller, received a reply stating THAT THE BOOK WAS LOST IN THE MAIL! I have received NO INFORMATION THAT THIS HAS OCCURRED; DID I RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT? NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!!!"
3,Eh...,"This ""Loveable"" Tale of adventure and friendship is anything but rememerable, infact it was the pure essence of all that is boring and evil only closely 2nd place from the most unenjoyable Golden Compass Series. During this book I felt all my emotions coming to life, the insesent gagging, my eyes drooping, my nose being clogged with the sheer stupidity, the ever resisting urge to rip the pages up and burn them and then laugh. My brain even hurt from the simplicity and I was about 6 when I read it. I just couldn't stand it, the only good part about it was that it was short so it ended quickly so I give it three stars for, Lame, Smelly, and stupid."
3,missing parts,free kindle edition missing ducks' ditty. i presume other poems based on other reviews. otherwise fine. is it copyright issues i wonder. also miss rackham illustrations. which do not seem to be available in any kindle edition. disagree with reviewer who says not suited to children. this was one of my first books.
3,"Decent read, not as advertised","The book is a decent read. Its not in-depth, has some really good word-based imagery, and a very amusing story with decent characters. However, only two of the characters really change or evolve throughout the story. Mole and Toad are the only two who show any progress or development. Its not a work of literary genius, but it is fun to read.Not as advertised: The item description mentions nonexistant colorful illustrations. They did not show up on my Kindle (which is a 2nd Gen and wouldn't show them anyway), my Kindle App on the PC, on the phone, on the tablet, or on my cloud reader. Not as advertised. On the other hand, it WAS free."
4,Signet Classics version is very small,"Before you order, note that the Signet Classics paperback version is quite small (about 4"" x 6.5"") with small font and small drawings. Nice for traveling light, I suppose, but I wish that, instead, I'd purchased a more attractive and easier to read-aloud version to share with my kids."
5,A Charming tale!,"I really enjoyed this book. It's a charming tale, and one that adults will enjoy as well. The illustrations are good. It's a really good story, that stays with you and is hard to forget."
1,Bad formatting of classic book,"I recommend trying and buying another edition of this book. This edition does not format the text correctly for the Kindle and places line breaks in the middle of every second line, rendering the text unreadable."
3,"A classic, but hard to place an age group","The Wind in the Willows is, of course, a classic, and deservedly so. There are so many reviews that I'll leave those to speak to the content. It is a beautiful book, but it's ""classic"" nature can make it challenging to find the right age to introduce to your kids. By the time a kid can read it independently, many of them will no longer be interested in a quaint-yet-majestic animal adventure tale. The younger age-set that would enjoy the animal-themed adventure tale will have a tough time with the language, perhaps even as a read-aloud. I tried it with my 5-year-old. He was completely engrossed at times. At other times, there are flowery digressions and tangents that, unfortunately, had him lose interest in the book altogether. In hindsight, I wish I had read ahead to know what parts to skip over to keep his interest. A beautiful book which, sadly, is becoming dated in our modern culture."
3,A tad on the dry side,"Although somewhat interesting, some parts got quite a little boring at times...otherwise it's a good read for a younger audience."
5,Just Beautiful!,"My 8 year old daughter and I read this together. We loved it! It's just such a beautifully written, funny, clever story of four friends - Rat, Mole, Toad and Badger and their wonderful adventures along the river.It was so memorable to my daughter that she actually dressed up as Mole for this year's school Book Week Parade and won best dressed in her class!"
4,Charming little book,"This is a charming little book, very famous, written for a child but clearly loved by adults also. Easily read in a matter of hours, perhaps on a train journey or a lovely sunny day in the garden. You will come away with a real feel good factor, following the lives and adventures of these enchanting (or in the case of toad, madcap) animals. Well worth a read, charming and funny."
5,My Favorite Version!,"Michael Hague's artwork is sublime! His version of this wonderful story is ageless. His beautiful pictures will enchant children, parents and grandparents as well as everyone who loves beautiful books.Over the years, I have bought many copies of Hague's Wind In the Willows for my friends and without exception they all fell in love with it, too.If ever a book deserved to be reissued, this would be the one!"
3,"Great book, mediocre illustrations","Soon after getting Wind in the Willows (Michael Hague, illustrator) from the library, my daughter fell in love - at bedtime, it's 'Toad! Toad!' and 'Hang spring cleaning!'. So, based on reviews of this edition, I decided to buy it. Sadly, we were both disappointed. The book is still great, but the illustrations in this edition are mediocre at best. Cartoonish and bland, they don't come close to doing justice to the author. The Michael Hague edition may have fewer illustrations, but they are deep, rich and glorious - just like the book. If your child is ready for this book, she's ready for 'grown-up' illustrations, too.Do yourself a favor - get the Hague edition instead."
2,Kindle edition is not illustrated!,"We have this in a print edition, and it's one of our favorite books. We have read it countless times, and we love to pore over the amazing illustrations by Michael Hague.We have already downloaded a free edition of the book for Kindle (which we use on the iPad), but when we saw this same book available inexpensively we downloaded it right away.We were SO disappointed to find that the beautiful illustrations were nowhere to be found. Maybe it's an iPad thing, but be clear before you purchase that this is just the story, not the illustrations. My daughter's Kindle is also illustration-free.It is unclear when ordering whether it is or is not illustrated, but I think it is misleading to use the cover of such a lavishly-illustrated edition to advertise an edition with none.I'm still giving it 2 stars because it's such a great classic, the font is nice and easy to read, and it's not abridged. The print edition gets 5 stars."
5,A Classic!,"This book is a re-read for me--I haven't read it in years! As always, the characters come alive with their very individual and unique personalities. I loved it."
4,nice illustrations,"The contrast of the images isn't as sharp as I was hoping, but it is a great addition, and I feel it is the worth the added cost to get the images."
2,Disappointed,I was looking for a children's book. The absence of line drawings or pictures will turn most children away from reading the book.
5,Childrens classic,Ah this book brought back so many memories from when i was a child back in England. What a fantastic story
2,There is no place like home and friends,"All writing needs a beginning, middle, and an end. The adventures of four unlikely critters longing for excitement stretches the imagination to believe they are real people in real life situations. The story would appeal to children. I read it as part of my bucket list to visit books l DID not read as a child. It was enchanting and had political undertones."
4,A very dear story!,I really was wanting an adoreable story to read to my grandsons. This one is just precious. It is written and expressed in the UK vernacular. It is terribly cute and I highly recommend. The book was delivered on time and shipped well!
2,Dissapointed,I thought by the description that this would have the illustrations from the 30's that I remember from my youth... It has no illustrations except on the cover... so it goes...
1,Wind In the Willows,I kind of disliked this book a little but it may interest somebody else. I hope other people enjoy this book
2,Pretty good read,It's a good read. Nice and easy to comprehend. I would not recommend though if you want a more thrilling/exciting book.
3,Not what I was expecting,"This book was not what I was expecting, but it it was still a cute, quick read. It's hard to picture animals living like and interacting with people, but made for an interesting story."
3,"easy to finish, but just okay","I see this was written in 2001 and I have enjoyed other books better from Sparks since this was written. Not to say avoid this book but this reader was a little less impressed with the character and story flow in ""a bend..."" I guess my main problem is the protagonist Miles, a sheriff in a small town who comes off a little silly and too drama prone for the story's own good. Still can't wait to read another novel by this talented writer."
3,Okay book,"I read this book a few weeks ago while on vacation. It sucked me in and I finished it in two days (but then again I had nothing else to do but to relax).A Bend in the Road is about a man named Miles Ryan. His wife Missy dies in a fatal car accident. The thought of it haunts him for years to come. Although Miles is still thinking about Missy all the time, he finds himself falling in love with his son Jonah's teacher Sarah Andrews. Little do they know, their lives are entwined in more ways than one.This book, although cute, funny, sad and romantic, is incredibley predictable. Like all Spark's novels, the writing style is elementary, and undescriptive.Good for a quick, easy read, but nothing spectacular."
5,Amazing!!,Definitely not your typical Nicholas Sparks book. I was hooked the minute I started reading it and could not put it down.
3,Not too bad.....,"I liked the story behind this book, it was a little slow to get into. Was happy with this book, but, I wish there was more to the ending."
5,Very exciting,Kept you're attention. Had an unexpected ending. The plot shows the disappointment and waste that comes from holding a grudge.
4,Sad mystery and sweet romance...,"Sparks is a pro at building real and emotional love stories, but he decontructs the romances he creates just as easily. A Bend in the Road centers mostly around Miles and his new love, Sarah, but their relationship is clouded by Miles' unwillingness to let go of his dead wife, Missy. Missy was the victim of a hit and run accident, and the person responsible has never been found.If you read this book, don't read the summary before you start it because it might give too much of the story away. Since I read the summary, I was able to figure out the whodunit part after just a few chapters so the ending was bittersweet because I was right. I like a mystery that stays a mystery until the end of the book.Overall, the story was decent, and the romance was sweet. I like Sparks, and I don't get tired of reading his books. I like his characters; they are always so welcoming and likable. He's a reliable author, and I guess that is why I keep going back to him."
3,One of his best (Spoilers included),"This is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. It really goes in depth with the character's emotions and throws you for a loop! That being said, I admit the ending left a lot to be desired for me (this happens with many of his books). I got a little worried when the two main characters went their separate ways only a chapter from the end. They reunited, but it never gave details as to their reconciliation. I wish he would dive deeper into the resolutions that take place at the end of his novels."
2,Another one I liked up until the end and then threw it,"I started reading Sparks' books about a year ago. I have read about eight. I either really like his books or I end up throwing them at the end. This book was good, but like some of the others, I threw it at the end. He needs to write more books like, ""The Lucky One""."
2,A Bend in the Road,"When I started reading this book I was enjoying it. However, after finishing, A Bend in the Road, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I expected the author to go into more depth about the relationship between Miles and Sarah. I certainly was not anticipating a cross between a ""romance"" novel and a ""who-done-it"" murder mystery. I found myself wishing this character (Missy) had died of a brain tumor if she had to die at all. Or better yet, why couldn't Mr. Sparks have had Miles be a divorced man who just happened to have full custody of his son?"
1,Can I give this NO stars?,"Awful. Just awful. I enjoyed ""The Notebook"" and even ""Message in a Bottle,"" but since then Sparks is just mailing them in. What was his publisher thinking when it decided to let this one go to print? AWFUL. I'm thoroughly ashamed that I read it through to the end. I have only myself to blame."
2,Predictable and Unambitious,"Anyone could have written this book. So many cliches, predictable conversations, hollow characters. This is basically a Harlequin romance written by a man. I can't understand how this book graces the Bestsellers Lists."
1,A Bend in the Road,"I was listening to the book and discovered that you had sent 2 of the #4 CD and there was NO #5 CD in the package so I could not finish the book on CD. If Amazon doesn't correct this matter by sending me another book, I will never order from Amazon again. I'm sure that somewhere out there someone has 2 of the #5 CD. Unfortunate, but very maddening. PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THIS."
3,Could have been better,"This was more of a mystery than the romantic story that Sparks usually writes about. It was still a good book but not as good as his others. The lead male character had a bad temper and I did not care for the way he was treating the lead female. Also, I don't think most women would just take him back no questions asked after treating her the way he did. It shone an unfavorable light on women."
1,Poorly Written Book,"It is a great story idea, but the writer made it predictable and trite. There were many long dialogues where nothing was actually said. I was horribly disappointed, and I live in the town the story was set. That in itself should have kept me interested...or maybe not?"
2,This was not Sparks Best!,"Lots of non-sense babbling through this book, I felt like he was just trying to fill in the holes,I was very dissapointed in this book. I did not like the creepy weird thoughts of the hit & run driver. I typically give my books to friends who like to read, if it is a good book, but this I will donate. I wish I could get the time back that I wasted reading this, it was horrible as far as my opinion goes."
2,Blech!,"This was my second Sparks novel. I really liked Safe Haven so I got this one from the library. I knew exactly what would happen in this book by about the 3rd chapter. I was entertained while reading it, but wouldn't recommend it. The love story was cheesy and, like I said, so predictable."
2,A very bland read,"I was really disappointed in this book and I am glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend money for it. The storyline was very bland and uneventful. Because this is a bestselling author, I expected it to get better, but it didn't. Not much happening in this story. It was a waste of time for me."
3,Nicholas Sparks,"As we all know, when reading a Nicholas Sparks book, the book is going to leaving you in tears for one reason or another. This book was strange and I wasn't a big fan. In fact, it was this book that made me decide I'd rather move onto a different author all together. It had a good story line but I just didn't really like the way everything ended."
4,wonderful,"i really liked the book, and i loved how the relationship progressed throughout but i wasnt a fan of certain areas as much as others"
2,I kept reading hoping it would get better...it did not!,"Shallow, boring and very predictable. It seems Nicholas Sparks is unable to write with any substance, after The Notebook, his books all seem the same, hoaky themes with no depth of character or literary interest."
3,A Bend in the Road,"A Bend in the Road didn't turn out to be the mystery novel I was expecting, and so I was a little disappointed with that aspect. On the other hand, it's not a bad story, and if you can put up with the predictability, it's worth a quick read."
1,Worst novel I have read this year,"I wasn't expecting great literature, but Sparks' novel is so banal, with a boring and predictable plot and a comic-book level of writing, that I only finished because I had made a game of guessing the next cliched phrases the author was going to use (I listened to the audio book) - and I was doing pretty well at it. The character of Miles was especially ridiculous: devoted father turns into crazed avenger and abusive boyfriend (who seems for a while to forget he even has a son)? Far from being touched by this love story, it made me want to gag. I do NOT recommend wasting your time on this book."
4,A Bend in the Road,An excellent book by a great author. I would recommend A Bend in The Road to anyone who likes to read a romantic book.
4,Very easy reading,I enjoyed reading this book it have its last and at the end I was really surprised.I would recommend this book to someone that wants an easy reading with a surprise ending.
5,A Fabulous Choice,"A Bend in the Road was and excellent book. I really enjoyed the budding romance between Miles and Sarah, and it really made it seem real the way that Miles was worried about his son. I really like how they moved slow with their relationship. It took me only four days to read this book. I highly recomend it."
5,A soulfull story of love lost and forgiveness.,"A Bend in the Road moved me as most of Nicholas Sparks books do. I was draw into the loss and sorrow of the main character and understood his fear of commitment, but enjoyed the unfolding of the story of love and loss and new love found and the risk he decided to take."
5,Hooked till the end.......,"Being a native North Carlolina girl, Nicholas Sparks brought back memories of those wonderful country people. The very way he describes the folks in this town and how they spoke are very native to true ""Tar Heels"". This book is one that you can't put down till the last word is read. Most Excellent in every way, from beginning to end!"
5,Heart warming love story!,"Sparks has done it again! I have cried during each of his books! He has quite a talent for writing characters people care about. The story is very entertaining, heartwarming and there is a great love story to boot! Sparks is at the top of my favorite author list now!"
3,Ehh..not his best.,"I just started reading Nicholas Sparks' book this year, and I have loved them all. A Walk to Remember is my favorite. This one was really predictable, once we got over the initial shock that Brian was the driver. The thing with the dog at the end was pretty shocking, too, but the rest of it was predictable. If you're looking for classic Sparks, look elsewhere. He just didn't seem to have it in this novel. The story took weird turns and some twists were just not right. However, I will remain loyal to Sparks because I think he is fantastic! Everybody has bad things now and then."
2,Boring and predictable,"This is the first Sparks' book that I've read (listened to on tape). It was very predictable, and I was disappointed in the elementary style writing. I also did not care for Miles, the main character. You can figure out the ""mystery"" so early on, that it is almost silly to finish the book. Don't think I'll spend time on another Sparks' book."
1,Not his best,"I love Nicholas Sparks but I was really disappointed in this book. It is very drawn out and most of it is pretty boring. I kept waiting for it to get better and pick up but it didn't. Also lots of parts repeated over and over again. I do not recommend reading this, unless of course you have trouble sleeping at night lol, I fell asleep reading many times.Read Sparks ""Save Haven"" instead and save yourself the money on this book."
5,Love it,I Love this book! It is one of my favorites so I bought it for a friend - very affordable and arrived on time :)
3,Mysterious Romance,"I found the book slow in the beginning. I was kind of bored when it was describing Miles' daily life after his wife died. It started to get more interesting when Miles meets his son's teacher. When the author described the different perspectives, like the person that did a hit-and-run on Miles' wife."
2,Easy read and predicable,"If you like to coast through a book, I would recommend this. Otherwise, it is pretty uninspiring. Ever since the Notebook, which I really liked, Sparks seems to have become...well, lazy I suppose. The Notebook swept me away, but his follow on novels don't seem to have the same inspiration."
3,"not bad, not great","If you like romances this book will not disappoint. But if you are looking for in-depth character study and interesting dynamics between the individuals in the story, this book might be a bit of a let down. It's a solidly written book but I would not overly recommend it to friends."
5,So good!,This was SUCH a good book. It was so not as expected. I definitely recommend this book! Its a must read!!!
4,dini's review of book by Nicholas Sparks,"A bend in the road by Nicholas sparks.I had read another books of Nicholas and found that rather nice. I like the sensitive way he writes. This edition I was not so impressed with.It was well written, sad and very intriging. That was ok I quite like that a little son was also invoved andit made for good reading. Again the theme was wrongdoing, how we react to this, how we deal with this and how we forgive.The thing that disappointed me was the steamy explicit sex scene's. Not for some people today I know; but I am not a fan of this. I do not think it nessesarry. But well written just the same and with lots of suspence."
5,Awesome Book,"This book is an awesome book, i would recomend it to anyone!!! If you are a person who likes to read, you will definately like it!! Miles is a nice man with a child whos mother had died. Then he meets Jonahs teacher and everything changes. It also has a mysterious ending. You will be very surpised once you find it all out!! Good luck!! You'll love it"
4,"Not the best, but still good","I got hooked on Sparks' books this past summer, and I think they are all great. While this one is not his best, it is still a very touching and interesting story."
5,Thrilling...right down to the very end!,"A bend in the road takes the reader on a journey that encounters heartbreak and sorrow, and ends with a chilling twist that is guaranteed to leave the reader smiling and teary-eyed."
4,For the hopeless romantic,"Nicholas Sparks' is the cookie cutter of commercial authors. He gives readers exactly what they want with ""A Bend in the Road."" It is an easy weekend read which doesn't require much deep thought. The storyline is predictable if you have read some of his other novels; the characters will either work things out and live happily ever after or one will die in a tragic accident (or of a terminal illness i.e. ""A Walk to Remember""). Women are drawn to Sparks' writing because he writes male characters that every woman dreams of, the knight in shining armor that needs to be saved himself. We are captivated by the idea of small town romantics. It is no suprise that Nicholas Sparks can sell books by the thousands and make the Bestsellers List."
4,Great Book!,"This book was very good, no surprise from Nicholas Sparks. I loved how it kept going back to the person who had did it, it took me until pretty much the end of the book to figure it out (which was nice because I was hooked the whole way through). This book had a little bit of everything in it, suspense, romance, faith, mystery it was a little bit of everything to keep you interested and Sparks wrote it perfectly."
4,"Not favorite Sparks book, but good....","Not one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books, but good none-the-less. Most times, his books get me right from the start. With this book, it didn't really start grabbing me until the second half. Lots of surprises (no spoilers here!) and twists in the plot. Some things I could guess, others I couldn't. All in all a fairly decent read."
3,Left me with a bad feeling...(CONTAINS SPOILERS),"I really enjoyed this book over all, but the end disappointed me. I suppose Sparks was trying to be realistic instead of the typical ""happily ever after"" ending, but I felt really bad for Brian, and if I were Sarah, I don't think I could have stayed with Miles if he couldn't forgive my brother and at least have some semblance of a relationship with him. But I do give Sparks credit for trying to have a more ""original"" ending than what you usually read in love stories. It's still a great read."
2,Not at all a page turner...,"The book was OK, but not nearly as good as I thought it would be. All Nicholas Sparks books are so predictable and they're just so repetitive. I thought the characters in this book were especially unrealistic. Miles was ridiculous and irritating, and Jonah acted like he was 3 years old rather than 7."
1,not his best,"This was an ok read...but just that, ok. I love nicholas sparks and have read just about all of his books but this book was not one of his finest in my opinion. i found it a little boring."
2,Meah,"Didn't really care for this book. I wanted to but it just wasn't a page turner in my opinion. I liked the relationship between Miles, Jonah and Sarah but 1/2 way through the story line kinda fell through and moved on to other things. I kept on reading and waiting for it to get better but it just never did. Every night as I read on my kindle in bed I would say to my husband ""I am ready for this to start getting good!"" My 2 fav Nicholas Sparks books = Safe Haven (LOVED it) and A Walk to Remember (very sweet)."
3,Beach Read,"Entertaining feel-good beach novel, but not particularly well-written. The characters are all-American sicky sweet, and the writing is so simplistic that this book can be read in one day with time to spare. Not awful, but not a great work of literature. Predictable ending."
5,Another tear-jerker..,"As always, another wonderful read by Mr. Sparks. You can't go wrong with his novels."
2,Predictable,"I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen. As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story. It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing. The story's decent. The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go? Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe? It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work."
4,Loved it - but was a bit predictable,I knew there would be a connection with the main characters - and of course there was. But what happened after the connection was out in the open - was different from what I expected. Another tear jerker - one story I kept trying to read the ending chapters on to see if my guesses were right - but just incredible as the other books I have read by Nicholas Sparks.
4,A Sweet Romance,This is a romance that is hard to put down. Although I don't know if this relationship could hold in real life. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish the author would of let the characters consumate their relationship after they were married. They jumped into the sack way to early. I will be checking out more of Spark's books.
4,FANTASTIC,"This book is really well written. It is not exactly a mystery, but it could well fit into that category. I gave it four stars because the ending seems a little hurried. It all came into place too soon. But, really, it is a good book. The ending can be a little surprising if you are not used to reading mysteries."
3,Enjoyable,"If your reading the reviews on Nicholas Sparks's ""Bend in the Road"" it's clear that people either immensely enjoyed the book or hated it. I, for one, found the story enjoyable. In spite of the story being slow at first and burdened by details at times, I was still able to relate & feel apart of the story.Each of us are faced with obstacles or painful circumstances. Sometimes they may even seem unforgiveable. In this love story, Sparks brings out the importance of working through and letting go of the bitterness/pain/hatred that we may feel. Even if these feelings are justified. Life goes on with or without you. The choice is ours to make. And I can't end this review without mentioning the ending. It was beautiful."
3,No Bang,"This was not my favorite Spark's book. It was a good story, however, very predictalbe. There was no bang at the ending except for who the driver was that killed Missy. But one could figure this out easily. I did think the characters were well written, especially Miles. I would have liked to have seen a more exciting, heart moving ending, then what there was. I have loved all of his other novels and will continue to read his new ones as they come out - this novel was not a page turner like his others."
3,Entertaining enough but nothing special - abridged audio CD,"This book (abridged audio CD) was engaging enough to keep me occupied during my daily commute, but I'm not sure if I would have continued it were I to have been reading the actual book. I thought it was a bit slow even in abridged version. The reader, John Bedford Lloyd, has a very good ""normal"" narrator voice but I had a hard time with the Southern accents many of his characters had...overexaggerated and slow, quite irritating. And sometimes it was confusing which character was speaking, because Mr. Bedford's normal voice would spill over into the characters and vice versa."
3,CAN I HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA SAP WITH THAT BOOK PLEASE?,"Let me start this review by saying I am not hard to please when it comes to romance novels and I don't mind a little extra sap mixed in, at times. For me this book was a good read to pass the time on these long winter days with cups of hot chocolate. If your looking for an enjoyable book, something that is not ""heavy"" and that you can see being a movie of the week on the LIFE TIME Channel you will enjoy this book. I did figure it out pretty early on and I still wanted to finish it. Can't ask for much more then that from a book that was in the bargin bin for five bucks at BORDER'S BOOK STORE. ( Off the record, about the author, a guy that looks that good should not be allowed to write romance novels. Boy is he hot )"
1,"Enough with the immature, and angry men...","Although I have enjoyed several of this author's previous novels, this one dissapoints. The main reason? A male character with the emotional maturity of a five-year-old. Two years after the death of his wife this guy is a self-indulgent rageaholic who can't get on with life. Yes, he is a good father and I admire that, but he is also impulsively angry, lacks self-awareness and is generally graceless when it comes to considering others' reactions to his wife's death. Yuck. As a man, I am tired of stereotypical (angry) and emotionally stunted male characters. How about a smart, sensitive, self-regulated guy for a change. I think I am most disenchanted with all the glowing reviews of the book by women readers. Is this behavior really romantic????"
1,SNORE ....,"Oh Lord, please deliver me from this boring, plodding story line. If it were not for my fetish about finishing every book I read, this one would have been back on the shelf within the first few chapters. Syrupy sweet; I feel like I've overdosed on cake & cookies after some time with this one. Mr. Sparks first book was very enjoyable, I think they have progressively declined since."
3,"Wonderful author, but not one of his best","In the past year I have become quite a fan of Mr. Sparks. I loved The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Message in a Bottle, and the Rescue. He has such an emotional way of writing and has drawn me into his other books in a matter of pages. That is why I am disappointed with A Bend in the Road. The book itself was close to 400 pages and I think the story could have been told in about 200. It seemed to drag and never ventured outside of the main storyline. In his other books I like how Sparks takes time to develop all the characters. In this particular story only the two main characters get the limelight. If you are looking to read a Sparks novel for the first time read this one eventually, but don't start with it because it doesn't do justice to his powerful writing style."
3,predictable,"The main focus on this is Mile's attempting to discover who really killed his wife. He kept accusing an ""enemy"" of his -- when really, by half way through the book I knew who did it. I then I had to bare myself through all of Mile's investigating and what-not to the point as to whether his relationship with Sarah would last."
4,Revival since his last book,"I could have my order wrong here, but I believe the book before this was ""The Rescue"" which I think was his worst book by far. This story, however, was fantastic. It's still doesn't compare to ""Message in a Bottle"" or ""The Notebook"" but is definitely a great read. I finished it in a couple of hours I was so eager to know what happened. It's a bit of a sappy romance, but the fact that it has an actual plot besides just the romancing sets it aside from the lovey dovey really sappy stuff. Of course, all his stories start off with some kind of tragic loss, but this one has a lot more depth to it than some of the others, and is a great book."
1,Ambler Scramblers Review,"A Bend in the Road is an emotional and intriguing book. Miles Ryan's life was torn apart when his wife Missy was killed in a hit and run accident. He felt that, as a cop and as a husband, it was his job to find the driver. He is trying to get through his problems when he meets his son's teacher, Sarah, a just divorced woman who is new to their town. They connect and work through their problems together but when they find out they are connected by a dreaded secret, they are pulled apart. One thing leads to another and Miles is highly doubting that he will ever see Sarah again. They don't know what they are going to do from there, but closure is soon found."
2,boring,"I lisetend to the audio casset & almost couldn't get through the whole thing...not only was the story sappy, but the person reading it made it even sappier. Nothing ruins a book more than the wrong person reading it. Too sweety for me."
2,A marketing product; not a creative novel,"I enjoyed the first Nicholas Sparks book I read, but now, after reading a few, it's apparent that Sparks writes for sales, to fill whatever contract, and not because he has a truly creative idea. A Bend in the Road is predictable and trite and is an insult to serious book lovers."
2,Much ado about nothing.,"This is the first book by Sparks that I've read. I've seen his books on bestseller lists and expected more. The plot was contrived, the abrupt ending too neat and convenient, and the characters unconvincing. The book seemed more like an extended Good Housekeeping romance story...maybe that's what Sparks writes. If so, this will be the last book of his that I read. I suppose I need to remember that ""bestseller"" does not mean literary excellence."
1,Sappy,"I really hate to do this, but it irks me that an over-rated author could get to be a best seller. This book is not as good as the worst Harlequin I have ever read! There is not one thing in this book that kept me turning the pages."
3,thanks a lot,"thanks so much for ruining the end of the book shawnmacd...no need to purchase it now. a bit of advice, some people read these reviews to find new books to read, and don't appreciate when people ruin the book by giving away the ending. don't take my 3-star rating seriously, i didn't get to read the book."
1,A Bend in the Road,"Good grief. If this hadn't been a selection by my book club, I'd never have read past page two. Just. Really. Awful."
3,DISAPPOINTING LAST 50 PAGES HURT THIS STORY,"I became very interested in these characters right from the start. They were engaging and likable and people who I could identify with.However, the last 50 pages proved to be very unsatisfying, as the protagonist took a turn down an extremely irrational road from which he never recovered. Reviewers who called this story ""sweet"" and ""uplifting"" obviously didn't stay onboard till the end.The story deserved a better resolution."
3,book review,How can I review it when I haven't read it yet.There is no star for haven't read it yet????????
2,Anyone else hate the narrator's voice?,"This book is extremely predictable, and does anyone else hate the narrator's voice? The voice of Jonah is annoying, and there is no real emotion in any of the dialogue. I doubt this book is any better in the print version, either. BORING. I do not recommend it, even if you are looking for a really sappy romance. Read The Notebook instead."
3,"Very predictable, average book, but still enjoyable.","The last two Sparks books I've read, The Rescue and this one, have just not moved me the way The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember did. A Bend in the Road was so predictable, that the big revelation lost all of its impact. I did however enjoy the love story of Miles and Sarah and the setting. But that is always two of the author's strengths - characters that you care about, and wonderfully descriptive narrative. I'll read his next book, but the author is on ""probation"" now as far as I'm concerned."
3,Fair,"This book is mediocre and moderately entertaining. Due to its simplicity, it is a quick read. The character development was a little weak. Miles went from being shallow to thoughtful off and on throughout the story. The personalities of the town criminals such as Otis and his brother were a little thin. I never really got a good feel for Sara's character. The first third of the novel is sheer romance while the second two-thirds pretty much drops all the passion and tries to move toward a conclusion to a bland attempt at a psychological thriller. The storyline does become more interesting toward the end. This book is a good read if you have a couple hours to kill in an airport."
2,Disappointing,I have liked all the Nicholas Sparks books I have read before until this one. This one starts out pretty good but by the end of the book I ended up disliking Miles and Sarah (the two main characters).I still would recommend Nicholas Sparks books but just not this one.
3,"Uh, it was nice","In the beginning I did enjoy the book, but toward the end my attention kind of was lost and I got bored with it. For me it was predictable of who had done it but maybe I am just really smart! Maybe not. Well, it was a nice book but I don't know if I would read it knowing how I feel now about it. It was nice but nothing amazing."
5,Excellent story,"I have enjoyed all of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one is no exception. Am looking forward to next one and to the movie ""A Walk to Remember"". Especially liked the happy ending in ""A Bend in The Road""."
2,Boring and Blah,"I was required to read this book for school, and let me tell you one word that describes it perfectly. BORING! I could not get into this book at all. It just wasn't an interesting novel."
4,A Bend in the Road,"Nickolas Sparks is a great and creative writer but I shy away from his books because of too much intimate detail. However, in the Bend in the Road he alludes to the intimacy without all the detail.This, added to his amazing writing talent, results in a truly great book.Many can relate to the trials of death, divorce,etc. and this book deals with it all so well."
4,The book that got me hooked on Nicholas Sparks,"This was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read and I immediately read 7 others. Miles Ryan loses his wife in an accident and tries to carry on with his life, raising his son, and keeping things together. One day he meets his sons second grade teacher and they fall in love. This new relationship brings him a surprise and answers some questions about his wife's death that are more than he can handle. A very intense story."
3,Love and thrills,"A Bend in the Road is a powerful love story in which to unexpected people fall in love. At the same time, it's not your typical love story including a bit of suspense along the way."
4,Good read,I thought the story was going to end one way but totally changed gears and ended differently. Couldn't put book down.
4,A BEND IN THE ROAD,"I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AND SO FAR, I LOVE IT. IT ISN'T AS GOOD AS OTHERS I HAVE READ BY HIM. ""SAFE HAVEN"" AND ""THE LUCKY ONE"" ARE STILL MY FAVORITES. AT LEAST THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN DEAR JOHN. I LOVE THE MOVIE, I JUST CANNOT GET THROUGH THE BOOK AS I HAVE TRIED AND FAILED NUMEROUS TIMES TO READ. ALL IN ALL, THIS IS A BOOK WORTH READING."
4,Excellent read,Very well written book. Nicholas Sparks comes through again. Enjoyed the book to the end. I haven't read a book that I couldn't put down for a long time. I would highly recommend it as a summer read.
3,Enh.,"Nicholas Sparks produces a competent if unexciting love story in A Bend it the Road. It is the story of two people's second chance at love after one of them has been through a nasty divorce and the other has lost his wife in a hit-and-run accident. The details of the courtship are formulaic (Sparks provides us with the heroine's hair color, for example) and not terribly inventive. The one element of intrigue is the unsolved hit-and-run: was it murder? an accident? an act of revenge? In the end, however, the suspense isn't enough to make the book memorable."
1,A Bit Disappointing,"I am an avid reader of Nicholas Sparks's novels, but, this latest by Sparks was truly disappointing. Other readers interested in Sparks should stick with ""A Walk to Remember"" or ""The Notebook"", which I consider his best works. ""A Bend"" is slightly above ""The Rescue"" (which was just INCREDIBLY disappointing as well), but, ""A Bend"" lacked Sparks's typical creativity and, therefore, was just too predictable."
4,A little depressing,I have read a few different Nicholas Sparks books and loved A Walk to Remember. The Notebook was wonderful but I found this one to be a little depressing. There was the love aspect between Miles and Sarah but the fact that Miles kept dwelling on his dead wife Missy kept bringing me down and I felt so badly for his son. It seemed like different writing for Sparks...not his typical romance writing.
1,This is truly amazing!,"If I could give this book negative stars, I would; I am absolutely flabergasted at these reviews. I had to read this book for our Book Club and found it to be the worst book I ever read and a total waste of my time! I am an avid reader and am angry when I read a book that is such garbage as this one was. Not only was it totally predictable, but Sparks' style is elementary. I read one other book by him for the same Book Club, and found it to be total dribble- what is the American public coming to?Better spending your time reading The Corrections- now that's a good use of your time."
1,Trite Drivel. Terrible Narrative Style.,"It seems that, in every bookstore, there's a colossal wall of Nicholas Sparks books. A Bend in the Road appeared to be an interesting read, so I picked it up, only to be extremely disenchanted. The narrative was simply horrible! Sparks spoon-feeds the reader - explaining the obvious, and disclosing ""clues"" MUCH too explicitly. Furthermore, he REPEATS these superfluous ramblings ad nauseam. He DESCRIBES feelings and emotions, rather than allowing his reader to sense and experience them. This takes the very purpose and pleasure out of reading a book! I find that Sparks's writing style is trite, predictable, rudimentary... and even a bit patronizing to anyone with more than two brain cells. Sorry, Nicky!"
4,BEND IN THE ROAD,I loved that the couple ended up together at the end even though you kind of wandered what would happen.
4,Dealing with the difficult side of life,"A Bend in the Road goes into the life of a young woman who has had to deal with difficult relationships through some bad choices. How she chooses to face these events displays her strong character as well as her understanding of what ""real"" love means."
5,Edge of Your Seat Story,"This was a ""whoa - what's next?"" kind of book. I never anticipated the ending. Didn't see it coming. This is a must read!"
5,A book that keeps you guessing,"This book is a heart wrenching story of love and overcoming an obstacle which most people would not be able to do.It makes you think about how much you would be willing to forgive once you know the whole truth about something that you had mispercieved. Because,you could only think of one way that something could have happened.To read another book the keeps you guessing try The Secret of Escape, a sailing mystery adventure."
3,Nice Romance,"Being from North Carolina and knowing New Bern I enjoyed the romance of the book. I found it to be an easy, quick read however, I had figured out some of the plot early in the novel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a sweet love story, rather it is love between a man and a woman or love between family members."
1,Another ONE star,"I simply couldn't believe that this book was written by a New York Times bestselling Author. I kept turning the pages thinking it HAD to get better. The writing is poor, the pace agonizingly slow, and the story trite. This must have been published because the author's other books were great. (This is the only Nigholas Sparks novel I have read.)"
4,Not one of his best,"This book was okay. I wouldn't say I forced myself to finish it, but just about. [...] I will say, the book really gets rolling about 1/2 way through and the last few chapters, naturally, are the best. It is an okay read. You must read A Walk to Remember....grab your hankie!"
2,Superficial,"One of those historical overviews that tries to cover a little of everything, and in doing so, covers nothing very well. Most of the book comes across as an orgy of name-dropping with very few broad points (except perhaps that Greek civilization affected lots of places in lots of ways, and bridged the gap between classical Greece and Christianity through philosophers' attempts at something like monotheism)."
4,"Short, practical and very inviting to read.","Short, practical and very inviting to read, this self-help book for divorcing parents imparts sound, useful information on a variety of topics including: telling your children about divorce, communicating with an ""ex,"" handling different parenting styles, helping children cope with their feelings and helping parents handle their own feelings."
2,Overly Simple,"This book is a very easy read. But it deals only on a very surface level with the issues around a co-parenting relationship. I was looking for advice with more ""meat"" than this books provides. Whereas it does provide a simple ""how to"" approach to problem solving, it does not provide much insight into the issues nor does it provide much insight into how some of these approaches may be received."
5,works great,I have a husky mix dog who gets terrible bites from bugs in the summer time. I've started using this on him and it works great to help his ears heal and keep the bugs away!
3,Fun but not entirely useful.,"I enjoyed using this book and found it fun for a little bit to look at. I still sometimes will bring it out to read about other people. I don't entirely believe in it and do not think it is something to follow so much. For my own part, some parts I could agree on but others I shook my head at. It's basically one of those things were you can interpret in different ways."
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping to receive a book about relationships to help with some classes I will teach. So, this book about astrology was very disappointing."
5,Great Book,This book has had the price lowered since the other guy's review and is exactly as shown in the picture. It is a must have for any serious collector of historical Bar Books.
3,WYSINWYG,"The seminal cocktail book that all serious afficianados should have in their libraries. Unfortunately, it does not come with the full-colour cover as shown in the amazon page that features it. Misrepresentation? The inside text is probably a straight black and white copy of the original or subsequent edition. Not great production values, cheap to produce, therefore should be priced much lower. The same can be said for the other title in the Classic Cocktail Books series that I have received, namely The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book."
2,not what I expected,"Although this book has some recipes, it doesn't have the variety that they sell at Single Barrel in San Jose, CA. I bought this book because it's on their website. During my visit, I was made an English Cosmo which was wonderful. To this day, I can't find this recipe anywhere!! Sorry, this book just wasn't what I expected."
1,Grossly mislabelled item,"This item is NOT worth buying. The cover suggests that the music is performed by an orchestra. In truth, EVERY single piece of music is performed on 1 (maybe 2) synthesizers. Any true fan of film music will be VERY disappointed. Please avoid this item at all costs."
1,Worse than a dead skunk on hot pavement.....,"At high noon, during a southern summer....This CD collection is abysmal! Don't waste your money on it. Synthesizers and not much else. This is worse than the infamous 'Drews Party Music' CD series, at least those covers use REAL INSTRUMENTS!!!!!I'd give it to someone just to get rid of it, but I wouldn't inflict this audiophonic nightmare on my worst enemy. You get what you pay for and boy did I get taken. Buyer beware.FrFubar"
3,"Good, but not one of Sleator's best","Leo is driving his friend Tim to New York, where Tim has an appointment with a publisher who is interested in Tim's drawings, when the two are seized by strange, dirty aliens who take their blood. Leo awakes with no memory of what happened, and there is no trace of his friend Tim. His story of what happened--""I don't remember""--sounds like a more than ordinarly pathetic excuse, until a psychiatrist begins working on him to recover memories. Strangely, those memories are not of what really happened....This book lacks Sleator's usual carefully structured plot--it just flows along, helter-skelter. Also lacking is strong characterization and the tensions between humans that Sleator usually works in as a sub-plot, and that's quite a loss. But it's a good, fast-paced read, with a eyebrow-raising twist at the end."
2,The Night the Heads Came,"The book, The Nights the Heads Came, written by William Slator, is a science-fictional thriller about a boy named Leo who encounters some creepy incidents. It wasn't the best I have ever read but it was O.K... I think that this novel is more for the younger kids who are more into the alien-type stuff, which I am obviously not. Leo has to deal with a lot of stuff while his friend Tim is missing from what seems to be, alien abduction. He has to go through tough therapy which I could probably never do in my lifetime. Leo reacts unconcernedly but horrified, and the ending of this is horrific. All in all I would recommend this book to a sixth-grader who likes science-fiction; it gets two out of five stars on my scale.JC"
2,"Fiasco, book or film?","Oh, is this book flawed. There are a number of incorrect facts from the small (Madonna's confirmation name is Veronica, not one of her birth names as Parish states) to the large (General Bethlehem was a character in ""The Postman"" movie that was completely made up and did not exist in the novel the film was based on). There are some grammatical and spelling errors. The writing is a cross between Entertainment Weekly and Premiere, and one gets the distinct impression that each chapter was written as a separate article that was rejected by either rag (there's little chapter continuity). One has to wonder about several choices Parish made in what films he chose to discuss (""Town and Country""? ""The Wild Party""?) while ignoring others he constantly mentions in passing (""Heaven's Gate"" being the obvious choice)."
2,Repetitive and Dull,"The topic of the book is intriguing, but the author seems to have cobbled the chapters together from previously published sources without conducting interviews or in-depth research of his own. There is a notable lack of juicy details and, as a result, the book is superficial and each chapter tells essentially the same story, but with different names. This could be interpreted as the author's way of making the point that Hollywood never learns from its mistakes, but that's a point that could have been made in fewer pages."
4,Informative but could have been written better,"James Robert Parish knows his material and delivers a well-researched, informative volume here. My complaints with the book are minor, and mostly have to do with the writing. Parish sometimes favors industry jargon where this kind of historical overview calls for more inclusive wording. Also, he really overdoes it with the term 'vehicle,' even to the point of misuse. Another odd thing is that the summaries near the end of the book begin to feel a little more personal and snarky, giving them more of a tabloid feel than the rest of the book. These are all trivial complaints, though. The author does, unfortunately, commit one unforgivable literary crime in the section about Popeye; specifically his characterization of Robin Williams as a ""brainy funster."""
2,flopola in more ways than one,"An interesting concept semi-doomed by a few built-in flaws and not a few glaring typos.Yes, you can hardly write a book about disastrously expensive films without including movies like Cleopatra, whose financial follies have already been covered ad nauseum for decades. But where are the chapters on such spectacular misfires as Myra Breckinridge, Hello Dolly, The Little Prince, Jonathon Livingston Seagull, Howard the Duck, Heaven's Gate and Bonfires of the Vanities?Case in point: As interesting as its offscreen travails may have been, The Wild Party (a scarely-remembered Raquel Welch ""art"" picture budgeted at under $1 million) was simply an unsuccessful film, not even in the same ballpark as the monumental bombs that are supposedly the book's focus. (And can this picture really have been shooting, as the author claims, from May 1974 to July 1975?)Typos aside, this book's biggest problem is that most of the material is old news to readers most likely to want to read it."
4,A Lasting Impression,"Fiasco, doesn't seem like a book one would be interested in reading, I mean- come on, Disaster! HOWEVER James Robert Parish did it again, he took us on a trip down memory lane and explained why some of these Top talent,writers,directors and all the money still could not pull us into the theaters. A history lesson, facts we thought we knew with a twist. I can not wait for book two."
5,a must read for all film lovers,"If I had only $50 in my movie book budget, I would buy TWO of Jim Parish's latest. I woudl give the second copy to any decision-maker in the industry. At first it seems that in this book there are only 14 ""iconic flops"" discussed. But in fact there are hundreds of films discussed and a mind-blowing list of financial failures appended and sorted chronologically. The cast list, for which Parish is famous (and copied), are worth the price of the book. How else would we know who played Charlie Chaplin in ""The Cotton Club""? Let's hope the industry can learn from past mistakes dn Parish's analysis. He knows the industry, the people, the history, the priorities. If the industry doesn't learn, it won't be the fault of Parish. This is a must read for anyone who wants movies to be worth our time and attention...although it is often fun also to see the flops, especially if we weren't investors in the stupid thing. Meanwhile, this book is definately a good investment."
4,Bombs Away,"Hollywood has always thought big. From time to time, it has failed big too.""Fiasco"" profiles some of Hollywood's most notable failures (and Parish explains what makes them worthy of note).""Fiasco"" profiles the minds and the money behind the worst of the worst and, what's more, explains how and why these projects went off the rails.It's fascinating to read how Elizabeth Taylor, Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Richard Gere, and Geena Davis each were involved their own 'errors in judgement.'""Fiasco"" chronicles both box-office and creative flops, and each story is as unique at the film itself.An appendix of failures, from 1960 to the present, appears at the end of the book.""Fiasco"" is great fun for movie fans and industry insiders alike."
4,Entertaining and informative,"FIASCO is certainly not for everyone, but it's a book that definitely and deftly illuminates some of the mishaps of ""modern"" (post 60's) cinema. The real joy of this tome of cinematic miscarriages is that Parish's style is so breezy and easy to read, that the reader can take in the vast historical, biographical, and economic data in a way that remains accessible and, dare I say, fun.What really impressed me about the book is the fact that Parish so effortlessly condenses so much information into such concise vignettes. He breaks off into little modes of expository anecdotes about a particular star or producer or moment in history that he's brought up, gives you the gist of what you need to know (including various tidbits that I would imagine are difficult to drudge up elsewhere), and then goes back to the main point without a lurch.Surely, most cineastes already know about the movies Parish discusses in his book, but there's a lot more there than you'd expect..."
5,Very Informative for movie lovers and students!,"I bought it for school, but will keep it for personal knowledge! Detailed reflection on causes for failed production, i.e. competitive mediums, studio involvement, cast & crew troubles, etc."
1,Utterly Terrible.,"These paintballs are the worst. They are so greasy, that once you shoot even a single ball, it screws up the rest. they break in the gun, and bouce alot. That's why they're so cheap.My advice: don't buy them, you'll end up spending more time cleaning your gun than actually shooting it."
1,crappy paintballs,these paintballs will acually cuase you to get more splatter on yourself than anyone else. They are horrible and even for the low price they are not worth the hassle of cleaning your gun after every round. They also dont break and always curve when you shoot even if there is no wind. If I could have given them a zero I would have.
3,Pure Death Metal,"This is Unleashed's debut album and it contains 11 songs of pure death metal. It's recorded at Woodhouse studios in Germany, which is quite weird because in the early 90s all swedish bands recorded their albums in Sunlight Studios. Reason for this could be that Unleashed are on Century Media and Centuruy Media uses Waldemar Sorychta and Woodhouse Studios. I say that this average debut album. It do not offer anything special just Death."
2,A Good Idea but a Flawed Product,"Wow, this is totally disappointing. The concept is fantastic, but the decals are NOT colorfast. I have had mine in the window for seven months, and the red color is completely gone."
2,Unimpressed,"This item doesn't stick to the window very well at all. It doesn't fall off per-se, but the top and bottom edges start rolling off and it looks very sloppy if you don't reapply it every few days."
1,These FADE quickly,"These have been the only static cling, i.e. not stick on, decals I have found in our area of NH. Thus, I have been using and replacing them for about 3 years now. They *FADE* very quickly. I wish someone would make a static cling version that would last, was thicker and did not fade. It would be worth a few dollars to save my animals lives!"
2,doesn't last long..,"adheres good to window however, the bright red color fades after about 2 months making the sticker appear transparent and barely noticeable (presumably from the sun, but it's worthless as a reliable alert)."
3,"Looks great, but doesn't stick well","It is very bright and colorful, and I am reasonably happy with it. The edges don't stick well at all, they keep rolling, but I put a very thin piece of tape along the top and bottom, and it is working just fine now. I really like having something that lets emergency services know about my dogs!"
3,Pet alert for emergencies,I ordered these to put outside for emergency professionals to alert them of pets inside that need to be saved. I thought they were stickers and they are window clings only. Didn't work so well in our house because we have dark screens over all our windows and these can't be seen. I really needed stickers or a plastic sign. Didn't work for me and was a waste of money
1,A disappointment,"This was a huge disappointment. When the decal is placed in the window over time the sun/heat takes the color off. When I wrote on there the amount of pets in the house and that it was cats, the writing would not stay. Once again the sun would bleach it out."
5,For peace of mind when it comes to my pets!,"This is a second style of window decal I choose to display in my home windows should ever a fire or other disaster affect my home while I'm not there and my pets are. I liked the larger display size and the attention grabbing red color. There is enough white display area for me to indicate (write) not only number of pets within the home but a general area where they may be located. I like the peace of mind these decals offered me knowing emergency personnel would be informed our pets could well be inside and need rescued. I purchased enough of this style and another product style to display on all the windows of my home. I'd recommend these to others if you have pets, these could be real life savers."
3,"OK, but fades quickly","It is nice that these come in a two pack so there can be one on the front and the back entrance to our home.They cling to a window- so this will really only work if you've got a visible window right next to the door or on the door.Positive:They seem to stay in place fairly wellEasy to remove without leaving residueLarge and visibleNegative:Fade quickly! Neither decal was facing really strong direct sunlight, but both faded quite a bit within one year- the one that got a bit more sun was faded to the point you really couldn't read it at all or notice what it was. This much fading meant it wouldn't serve its intended purpose."
3,Doesn't stick to the window!,I have bought the same decals before and had no problem but these don't seem to stick to the window and keep curling up at the edges. Real useful if they fell off during a fire!
5,Great value,Just the decal I wanted. Easy to move and does not leave a mark on the glass. Shipped faster than expected.
1,Good till faded,"The attention-attracting red color has faded to nothing, it would be lucky if someone noticed this sticker. Look for another one! Also for something to go on my front door I would have preferred something less cartoon-y"
3,Nice but don't always adhere well,"This Pet Alerts are a good deal, but on our windows they do not seem to adhere like they're supposed to. I added a tiny sliver (so small you can barely see it), and that works very well."
2,Looks good at first but fades with minimal sun exposure,"I'm not sure why but this window decal looked great for about 5 months, then it began to fade. I have this decal in a window that is mostly protected from the sun most of the day plus i live in the northwest so i don't get a lot of sunlight. I don't recommend this product."
1,They do not work!,I just received my stickers and when placed on a CLEAN WINDOW they fall right off. I can't get them to stay. Not only do they not work I paid twice as much for the shipping as I did for the sticker's (2) I guess I should have read the feedback first.. Now I need to order from a different vendor! Bad product :(
3,Screws were missing,"I was happy with the product, but the 4 screws to attach the Denali cover to the bracket were missing. I found 2 screws in my shop that fit, enough to hold it on, but I wasn't pleased. That's why I gave it a 3."
1,Doesnt smell like sandalwood,"Terrible smell, nothing at all like sandalwood. It smells more like a bad mixture of musk and other misc stuff. Thankfully, the ""fragrance"" isnt strong, nor does it last long. Complete waste of money."
2,Not Sandalwood...,"I'm still looking for a good sandalwood product, but this is not it. Best one I've used so far is Aubrey Organics' City Rhythms.Men's City Rhythms Aftershave - 4 oz - Liquid"
3,"Okay, but not great...","I love the smell of sandalwood, so had high hopes for this one. It's okay, but doesn't really come off as very much of a sandalwood scent, IMO. As such rarely wear it and won't buy it again. Doesn't have much staying power either. It's not a bad scent, just doesn't do anything noteworthy enough for a repeat purchase."
3,"Alexander Shields,it ain't","Pleasant classical fragrance. fades rather quickly and lacks strength. Not on a par with the far more intense and complex, Alexander Shields sandalwood which regrettably is no longer made. Ms. Arden would do well to see if she can find the Shields formula. It was the best."
5,Sandalwood cologne,This cologne is an excellent product. My wife loves the way I smell. It has a masculine smell that is very subtle yet definitely masculine.
5,Good and old fragance,"I was looking this fragance for years, was the father's favorite.Good purchase"
4,Jade Green: A Ghost Story,This is a wonderful book! I recommend it. One of my favorite parts was when the hand was playing the piano. Another part I liked was when Judith saw the blood on the stairs.
3,Jade Green,"This book wasnt that scary. You might not want to read it at night. It is worthwhile reading thogh. Its about a girl who goes to a house to help out like a maid). The thing is she keeps on seeing this hand. THE HAND OF JADE GREEN, BUT did she really kill herself. Is she evil. And theres something about Charles but she doesnt know what. READ IT AND FIND OUT."
5,"""everyone plug your ears; I'm going to scream!""","this book is teriffing, but in a good way. it isn't thick but it demands to be read again and again. this is the scariest book I have ever read."
5,Jade Green,Jade Green was an excellant book. This book was my favorite ghost story that I have ever read. The book was like you were inside the book with Judith. I have never ever read a book like this in my life.
5,An excellent story of suspense.,"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's Jade Green provides an outstanding ghost story as it tells of Judith, a new orphan who awakens a ghost in her new home with her uncle. A creeping hand and a dangerous secret affect her newfound home and threaten her in this excellent story of suspense."
4,Page Turning Ghost Story,"Wow! I couldn't put this book down. The author graduallydivulges pieces of information, so the reader can figure out what'sgoing on. Judith has come to live with her uncle after she is orphaned to the dismay of her lazy, philandering cousin. She soon learns that a girl, Jade Green, ""died"" in the house. Gradually parts of the dead girl's life and death are revealed and the ghost makes appearances in the form of a severed hand! Very creepy, but great. I gave it 4 stars since I wanted more to the end, I felt it stopped short."
4,Jade Green,"Have you ever read a book with so much suspense that you just have to keep reading it and you can't stop? Then Jade Green is the book for you. It all starts when a young orphan girl named Judith, moves in with her Uncle Geoffrey and Ms. Hastings. A girl named Jade Green is supposedly haunting the house. Judith is really scared and tries to hurt a mysterious hand. Whose hand is it? You will have to read it to find out.I really don't like Cousin Charles because he is kind of snooty and unwelcoming. He is very mean to her and just won't stop spying on her. I really like Zeke because he is very nice to Judith and is very romantic. At first I was wondering why Judith couldn't bring green into the house. She can't bring the color into the house because that was Jade Green's favorite color and her last name. This story is very suspenseful and mysterious. It is definitely worth reading!"
1,Inappropriate,This book is inapprapriate for young readers. It ends with the orphan girl almost being raped by her uncle. Then the ghost's hand strangles the uncle. This is not something I want my child reading. It was required reading for him. Can't we find more encouraging and respectful plots for our kids.
5,great story,"this was one of the best books I've read lately. Good ghost story with lots of suspense. The villian of the book was not who I expected it to be, but it was great. You'll be surprised at the end."
5,WOW!,"This book is awesome! From the moment you pick it up to the moment you read the last word, IT IS THRILLING! I recommend this book to everybody and anybody!"
4,A Hand with no body,"I like this book and some parts no,I liked this book because it has horror and the parts I didn't like says thigs that kids shouldn't read, only teenagers can read it,but it doesn't say things that are really bad just skip those parts.It was a good book and scary, with a little horror.In this book a ghostly hand tries to save Judith Sparrow from Charles but Judith doesn't know!"
5,Jade Green,"Our book is about this girl and her name is Judith Sparrow. This teenage orphan moves in with Uncle Goeffery because her home used to be on the streets. The main characters in this book are Judith, Jade Green, Charles, Uncle Geoffery, and Mrs. Hastings. This story was extremely interesting and inviting. We enjoyed it because it left you wondering after each chapter. Connections that we made throughout the book were that one of us was adopted just as Judith was. Also, this book related to our lives in that you should not always trust the people that you don't know alot about. The most interesting and exciting scene in our book was when they first mentioned about Jade Greens hand. To know more about her hand read the book to find out. Moreover, we loved the work of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor in creating this wonderful book!"
1,Jade Green,This book was kind of boring. But I really liked the words the author used. The way she wrote made me feel like I was dragged into the story. I felt like I was taking a place in the story.
3,a nice book,"I liked this book; it's a fairly typical baby boomer coming-of-age book with all the stock middle America characters, but it was well done and had a few interesting twists. The anachronisms got to me, though. (A *used* Mustang in 1963, when the first Mustang didn't come out until 1964?) This felt like a 1990's view of the early 1960's, and for that reason it didn't ring true."
4,when a marriage falls apart,"12 year old Suzanne Keller thinks everything is finally going right when her family moves into their new home. Her mother isn't gulping down aspirin or immobile with a migraine. She seems to turn into the mother she has always wanted. That's until the news of JFK's assassination rocks her world.Suzanne's mother, Helen was obsessed by him, his family and all he stood for. Once again, she is irrational, nervous, chain smoking and chain reading, looking for an answer to the question mark of her life.The family disintergrates around Suzanne as her mother tries to deal with the demons of her past and get a grip on the future."
4,"Easy to listen to, laid back guitar sounds","This cd has bits that sound a little like some of the Narada label guitar offerings, some other bits like Acoustic Alchemy and also, a little bit country.I guess laid-back New Age country guitar might be closest. Whatever it is, Wollo's cd is really charming, easy to listen to and despite the comparisons above, unique. If you like relaxed guitar sounds, you will like this cd."
5,Outstanding Album You Probably Have Never Heard,"I bought this back in the early 90's at a record shop on the east coast while stationed in the Army. I read a review in Guitar School magazine giving the album rave reviews. I highly recommend this disc. If you are someone looking for a pure hard rock record that still stands up to most anything put out today, you won't go wrong with this."
5,Great Album,"This was one of the first Rock Christian Albums I every purchased, over 20 years ago. Was told only the devil owns rock music. Not the first lie I was told by the church but one of the most guilt causing ones. Still have this music album and now many many more. Great songs that never gets old. God Uses Rock or whatever is given to him for his purpose."
5,The Best Book on Prayer that i have read,"I can't say enough about this book. One of the best books I have ever read on prayer. Richard Pratt looks at the Three elements required for prayer, God, Ourselves, and Communication. The book is broken up into 12-13 chapters so it is great for using for a Sunday School class or for Church Home Group bible study. The fact that each chapter is individual from each other, which helps in that if someone misses a week, they are not ""lost"". The author looks at praying through our joy, our sorrow, and not just focusing on one aspect of God himself (i.e The Righteous Judge, Merciful Father, The Great Healer) but to focus on all his attributes. I try to read this book once every other year as a refresher. A must buy!!"
4,"Pray With Your Eyes Open: Looking at God, Ourselves, and Our Prayers","Haven't finished reading yet. This is a special book on prayer compare to others I have read. It combines Biblical teaching, theology with practical instructions nicely. Very helpful."
4,Chemical Soldiers,Chemical Soldiers is an excellent resource for information concerning the chemical warfare used in WWI. It was an easy read and very informative.
2,Very disappointing,For the price of the knife I expected much better quality. First off the handle feels cheap; almost like plastic parts you would snap together for a childs toy. The blade was not nearly as sharp as some of my other knives (I have 2 kershaws that exceed the form/blade/function of this knife in every way) and is a complete let down especially for the price. THis is my first benchmark knife and I was hoping for alot better.
4,"Great knife, too large for most everyday task","The build quality around this is great and the design is well thought out. Virtually every point on the knife is textured in order to increase the gripiness and I know understand why the axis lock and benchmade have the following they do.My only complaint with this knife is it's just too big for an everyday carry knife. I may buy the minigrip in the future but I've found myself leaving this at home and using ole reliable, a Victronix SAK priced at less than a third of the griptillians."
4,Good knife,I would say this is a good knife the blade is great the handle is OK. It is a hollow plastic so when you flick the blade open and then closed it makes a annoying popping sound. The axis lock is fast and very smooth. I would say if your looking at this knife also look at the paramilitary 2 it is a great knife but it is not perfect but almost. If you could combine the two then you would have a perfect knife. The axis lock and the blade on this knife makes it worth buying the handle needs improving.
2,Good knife ?????,"I own tons of knifes from Chris Reeves knives to china made 3 $ knifes. I wanted a good EDC, so I looked at the benchmade 550HG love the blade shape and the sypdie hole and the weight so I made the purchase. When the package came in I could not wait to open the box, after opening the knife I checked the blade centering which was off really bad to one side also the axis lock was sticking every 3 to 4 open/closes for a 80-90 $ knife this should not be. Sorry benchmade will stick to a Spyderco Para-Military 2 wayyyyyyyyy better craftsmanship and around the same price."
5,WHEAT BELLY,WHEAT BELLY... I LOST 60 POUNDS IN 12 MONTHS AND STILL FOLLOW GUIDELINES. DROPPED FRON 255 TO 195. 44 TO 38 PANTS AND XL TO L. SHIRTS. DONATED 70 POUNDS OF CLOTHING TO RED CROSS. ABOUT SAYS IT ALL!
4,Best,"I mainly wanted a functional and cute folding step stool and this is the best I could find. It is a little larger than I expected...but I must not have looked at the measurements. I think it'll be a great addition to my place. Feels sturdy and is pretty cute. The box it came in was packaged poorly, but no damage was made."
5,Exceptional Value...Just what I needed.....,"Exceptional Value...Just what I needed.....Polder 2-Step Designer Step Stool with Rail, Argento Silver and Black...very sturdy and durable...folds up really easy....very happy with this purchase!~"
2,Good Step Stool But Missing Rubber Foot,"This is a good step stool and I would have given it five stars had it not been missing a part when it was delivered. I searched high and low for the missing rubber foot (which must have fallen off before it was packaged) to no avail. I wrote a complaint to Amazon, but got no response. Since I needed to use the step stool immediately, I improvised by taping several layers of paper towel around the leg with the missing rubber foot. I did not want to go through the trouble of sending this huge package back but am annoyed that amazon did not even acknowledge my complaint."
5,Step Stool Perfect,"The step stool by Polder lives up to every expectation I had of a sturdy, reliable, and safe way to reach the tall cabinets in the kitchen, and to accomplish other tasks in our home. Easy to open and it feels sturdy when it opens with just a click. This step stool comes with a rail, that lets even the most unsteady person feel secure when using. I have seen others that were shakey at best and just plain unsafe, but the Polder feels and is as strong as you could get at a reasonable price. Speaking of the price it was a great buy for the money, you won't go wrong with this designer step stool."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"DO NOT buy anything from AB Marketers. They are a joke. This pillow cost $100 dollars and the zipper on the cover is cheap and flimsy so it broke off when washing. So the claim that it is washable is a complete joke! What's worse, you cannot purchase a new cover without purchasing an ENTIRE other $100 pillow. No one sells one that fits, including the company!"
1,Too steep a slope,"This pillow was disappointing. If I'd been able to try it prior to ordering it, I would not have purchased. It is just too steep a slope up from the bed. I've tried to sleep on it both on my back and on my side and there is just no way. It's not the fault of the pillow, just that I should not have bought an item like this without trying it first. I will look for another that's not so high."
3,"Ok, but doesn't come with the smaller pillow as shown","Thought it would come with the smaller pillow also, but apprently it doesn't. Had to wash the cover as it came dirty. Now I have to buy the smaller pillow also."
4,A Good Read about Audubon's Challenges,"Rhodes describes Audubon's challenges, his demons and how Audubon persisted and succeeded. A good read for Audubon fans. A good effort by Rhodes, but not his best."
5,great CD of party monster surf rock,"you will love this CD. It is fun, fun, fun. Great songs, great humor, great recordings. I listen to this one a lot, especially in the morning when I go running and need something good to pick me up and get me going. Make sure you have this CD on hand if you ever have a Halloween party!"
5,I Love Lucy,"This is my favorite I love lucy DVD. It has it all: Lucy dresses up as a martian, the Black Wig, etc. Cant say more than if you can only buy one season make it season 3."
5,Einfach Klasse!,"Als großer I love Lucy Fan freue ich mich, dieses DVD Paket wärmstens empfehlen zu können. Wunderbar lustige Episoden, mittlerweile habe ich sämtliche Folgen und schaue sie mir immer wieder gerne an - von Season 1 bis Season 6. Mit Lucy kann man nichts verkehrt machen :) Herzliche Grüße aus Deutschland!"
5,I really love Lucy,Great DVD collection with complete and uncut episodes. I watch them with my children and we never fail to laugh even if we have see the episodes before. I highly recommend this series
4,Overall great set!,"Just wanted to say that on Disc 5 in the Special Footage section there was a minor flaw in the Christmas Tag scene with Ricky and Lucy; Lucy's first few words are temporarily muted in the beginning of her dialogue; If one keeps rewinding several times in the hopes of hearing the full sentence, there is a possibility to overcome the problem. My DVD player plays perfectly and if anyone noticed this imperfection, please post your impressions as soon as possible. I LOVE LUCY!"
3,"Woody the Woodpecker returns, for the 2nd Time","What's not to like about Woody Woodpecker?Even though volume 2 contains the Paul J Smith efforts who came in on budget, but short on comedy,these toons are a hoot. My kids, who have only seen a few Woodpeckerss, loved this set. Watching some of the episodes, I remembered these played at lunch-time during summers. Ahh, what memories.The set includes 75 cartoons starring Woody, Oswald, chilly Willy, Andy Panda, Buzz Buzzard, and Lucky rabbit. We can't forget Knothead and Splinter either. Walter Lantz is remembered for many things, and Woddy is just one of them. If you don't like one cartoon, just skip ahead, you're sure to find one that keeps you laughing. Tex Avery isn't too bad either!The special features include TV pilots, a TV show episode, and 'behind the scenes'.All worth the money.Tim Lasiuta[...]"
1,"Nice box, terrible product","This is probably the worse excuse for a commercial software package than I have seen in 20-years. The documentation, including the online PDF manual is useless, following some cosmic logic that would suppose if you threw 2 different 500-piece jigsaw puzzles into the air it would come down as a single completed picture. I spent 3-hours trying to make the ID3 functions work correctly and only 25% of the time would files get updated correctly, but often even some of those would mysteriously later blank out the data in the fields. The manual proudly declares this is ""an intuitively constructed program,"" - perhaps if you are a schizophrenic monkey. The producer touts a so many great options available with this program that I'm sure some of them are bound to work - but after wasting 4-hours with this turkey, I couldn't find many (even after downloading their ""update."") Consumer beware, this product is junk!"
1,Absolutely garbage,I bought this program because I owned an old version of Magix Audio Cleaning Lab which for its time was great! This idiotic program won't even load properly and now that it is partially on my computer it has taken over control so that I get error messages when I try to run iTunes or even the Windows player. I have tried several methods (unsuccessfully) to uninstall it and have decided that to get rid of it I will have to reformat my hard drive. I have NEVER bought such a piece of trash in my life. And forget the company's customer service also - more like customer dis-service.
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY - AVOID,The CDDB database flat out does not work at all which renders the program essentially useless. And you can forget MAGIX support or the user forum. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!
1,absolute trash-waste of money,"I bought this software because I used an older version of mp3 maker but it started having some problems. Since I liked the product for it's simplicity and functionality I decided to buy this newer version. What a horror! To get full mp3 functionality you have to register the product and then you get a code send by email. Doesn't sound to complicated, does it? I tried everything in my power to get this code, but in vain. Costumer service sucks, it only works by mail or life chat. All my chatpartner gave me was the same instructions from the program's help menu! A call would cost you -no kidding- $25 !!! So now its rotting in some landfill for throwing away is the only thing left to do."
1,Magix is really no magic at all,How can I perform all those features listed with this product when even the CDDB does not work. I install the program and nothing works right. The AudioID that's supposed to give me track info takes a long...long...time for each track. I feel like I wasted my money. I have older versions of MP3 makers and they worked better than this supposed updated one. Don't you test anything before you send it out for sale? I am extremely disappointed and this supposedly cool software is just going to sit and collect dust.Useless!S.K. from New York
5,"excellent book,he holds your attention so you have to finish",i'm reading this book on the tapes for the blind and find he is so good i have all i can to put the book down
4,reread,"I actually read this series when it first came out way back when. I restarted it when I saw it available on Kindle. John Jakes has a great way of making his heroes very likeable and the villains very unlikeable and yet at the same time they are very realistic and believable. Having rediscovered the books, I plan on going through the series again, but will be waiting until they are at a more reasonable Kindle price."
4,Just ordered the next 2 volumes....,"I love John Jakes and after finishing vol I, I expect the story to get better and better. The writing style is excellent, easy to follow and flows perfectly....Can't wait to read the remainder of the chronicles. If they are half as good as North and South, I will be happy."
4,great historical fiction,"This is a story that seamlessly interweaves a great plot and characters with the historical setting of the beginning of the American Revolution. You have to suspend a little disbelief to believe that Philip Kent just happens to be in the right place and meets the right people at every turn in our nation's beginnings, but the excellent writing keeps the story moving, and really invests you in the characters. A great way to learn of our nation's history, and a very good read too!"
5,full of detailed history of the time period,"I had a hard time putting this book down. Love reading about life and times of this era. John Jakes is a great story teller with true history in the background. Cannot fathom all the aspects and horrible-ness of war on the ground in those days - the filthiness, disease, heartbreak. And the dedication people had to live in America in freedom. John Jakes brings those realities to life. I intend to complete the series."
5,A favorite.,I remember reading this when the series was first published in the 70's. Just as good now as then. Highly recommend this series.
1,Boring...,"I read the first hundred pages or so of this book, which was recommended by a female literary (?) friend. It's annoyingly unbelievable. Just a romance novel with a few historic facts thrown in, written at a 15 year old level. He couldn't have developed his reputation with this novel."
1,Very dubious reprint.,"Used copies of the original of this are readily available and *significantly* cheaper than this so-called affordable edition. To make matters worse, Ward Press seems not to have any web presence whatsoever, leading me to be rather suspicious, especially since, to my knowledge, all editions of this particular text are still under copyright, which is why they are not available through Google Books or any other scanning system.It's worth noting that nowhere in the description is the date of original publication mentioned for this, which is concerning, as it is important to know which edition of the repeatedly-revised original this actually is.I would love to be wrong in my suspicions, but I very much fear that I'm not."
3,no bionic sound WTF,"The bionic sound is missing on season one....no bueno....still pretty good but loses some of the fun, hopefully season 2 has it"
1,Bad customer service,Ordered this and canceled it within an hour of ordering and it was listed as not yet shipped but they shipped it anyway. Now I have to go through the hassle of waiting for it in the mail and then returning it. Very poor customer service.
3,disappointed,My husband opened this yesterday as this was all he wanted for Christmas and cd 1.5 is all scratched up! Unfortunately when I rec'd and opened it a couple of weeks ago I threw out the packaging as I re-wrapped in Christmas paper.
3,"This show needs to be remastered; better, stronger.","All good fun of course, I can't imagine many people that buy this DVD are new to the adventures of The Bionic Man.The big downer with this season is the poor colour balance and rendering to digital. On my big LCD screen its muddiness is apparent.I'll wait until Universal gives this show the technical technical attention it deserves.Until then it remains a pricey DVD."
1,What a disappointment.,"I will wait until they release it for viewing on AMERICAN machines, before I go digging around for any ""special unlock codes"" to watch this show. How incredibly lame that the release to other countries would take priority over the country this show was made in.Rediculous.I was initially excited to see this show available, I absolutely LOVED this as a kid...but then...depression. :( If this is never released in USA format, I will never buy.What would have been an easy 5-star rating, gets one measly star soley based on this reason."
5,dvd,Really liked this dvd. I enjoy watching Lee Majors. It was a tv program originally so it was fun to watch and no bad language.
2,Certainly not a book for beginners,"There are a lot of hard math and comparisons among different OCR methods, but there is almost nothing about software implementation and algorithms. For example, the book does not talk about how to apply the integration formulas to integrate over the discrete image pixels."
5,Embrace the changes in life,"I loved this book. It was written with such wisdom and sensitivity. This is a wonderful reflection on aging-- a time of peace in knowing who we truly are. It encourages us to relax and enjoy where we are in life, to look at the positive, and to embrace the changes.Read and enjoy!"
5,brilliant,ASTHE AUTHOR OF BUSH LIES IN STATE I HAVE TO SAY THAT ON REFLECTION ITS DAMN GOOD.

1,Bad writing.,"""Essay"" is a generous term for the miasma of run-on sentences that comprise this book. The essays are rambling, egoistical and full of juvenile arguments, only a few of which are rescued by McCourt's humor. As in ""A Monk Swimming"" and ""Singing My Him Song"", McCourt shows a fine lyrical voice, but no cold eye for truth. He seems to prefer cliches to realistic descriptions.Malachy McCourt is a man of many talents but writing does not seem to be among them. Those who buy this book expecting the skillful prose of a Frank McCourt will be disappointed."
1,I was looking for good old fashioned,"Bush-bashing, and found this one to be quite flat-footed. After page 10 I was like ""OK, I get it, what else?""Also, the comments below, credited to the author, in response to a bad review, are kinda creepy. I mean, if McCourt is gonna dish it out he ought to be able to take it too, right?"
1,Not worth the money,This McCourt Brother is not a good writer. His style is tedious and he has nothing new to say. Don't waste your money on this one-go to the library. I am sure there will be copies available.
3,How Many Miles to Babylon ? the film,"A little disappointed :The actors are convincing in their roles, no doubt about that.But having read the book, the film was exactly what I expected to see, word after word, and its tempo was too slow, and some scenes that were significant in the book ended very flat. To see once but not more than once, not too long but boring...little about Ireland (setting of part I of the book by Jennifer Johnston), very little about WWI (setting of part II of the book)."
1,Beware! Picture is misleading,"I ordered this surge protector based on the picture. What I received was a fairly generic, low protection (less than 400 joules), over-priced tablet. On top of that, Amazon.com has not refunded me the full price I paid for it, arguing that the return was not their error! A very, very deceiving offer."
1,Wrong pictures,There is an error on this item.The picture you get of this item DOES NOT match the picture on the product page. The one on the search page looks much nicer.
3,What A Difference One Generation Makes,"This novel accurately points out the diferent cultural values and morals which characterise people from different generations and ethnic groups.This novel gives a realistic portrayl of mother daughter relationships and an adult's memory of her her childhood.Although this novel does give a very pessimistic view of romantic relationships,"
2,"Has potential, lose the sex acts and profanity!","I actually stumbled on this book in the library, in a desperate, few-minute search for some quality reading, it must have been the title! I have always read wonderful stories about the old Chinese culture, lives and characters. But some newer authors can do the ""new"" clash very well. There were good descriptions into the lives of these two generations, but I wasn't intrigued by the pathetic lifestyle of a young girl fulfilling her sexual angst. The story doesn't evolve into a plot and not much happens. It rambled on and on about living back home but I didn't want to read a whole book on the subject. Again, there is potential for this author!"
3,Not great,"Although this offers a realistic protrayal of Chinese-American family life with immigrant parents and American-born kids, I found it just depressing and flat. I only got through it because it's a short read. Didn't grab me."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was very disappointed in this novel. Granted, the author is talented but, I could not get into this book. I did finish it but it took me a weeks. Nothing in this book made me want to pick it up once it was put down. I struggled to get through it. The chacters were lifeless and uninteresting. I did feel sorry for Ruby's father Franklin. These characters had such an opportunity to discover why they didn't get along but nothing was resolved. Ruby remained selfish and Bell a doormat."
2,A chore to read,"I'm not particularly picky when it comes to books. I'll excuse flaws after flaws if something about the book catches me. This book, however, was such a chore to read. Ng's grammatical errors were obvious and frustrating. Sentence structures were poor, unimaginative and many times defensive even at times when it need not be.But her biggest flaw were her storytelling paths. They were unfocused, many times uninteresting, lacking grasp and shaky. I found myself trying to help her re-write her book. It simply became tiring.While I'm not against the use of profanity, I felt Ng's excessive use of it left me with the impression that the author was a poseur trying too hard to reiterate Ruby's angst."
4,Ruby's search for her soulmate ends in self-realization.,"Ng's first novel vividly portrays Ruby's confusion and restlessness in the months following her graduation. The author's detailed description of Ruby's emotions and desires offers a deep study of her heart. Almost a ""coming-of-age"" novel, ""Naked"" carries its readers through Ruby's realization that people are not always as she thinks them to be. Although her summer at home brings her closer to her family, she comes to understand that her childhood perceptions of them were not as clear as she once thought. ""Naked"" offers a variety of subplots, each with one common factor--Ruby is dissatisfied in some way with the people she comes into contact with. The novel's pace brings the reader even closer to Ruby's constant search for her soulmate, a quest that even she does not even realize that she is on. As she finally understands that nobody--not her father, sister, Nick, or even her mother--is perfect, she truly begins to grow up."
2,False Advertising,"The name of this book should be Depressed Girl Moves Back Home. The best parts of this book were the excellent descriptions of everything from the laundry to the basement to the neighborhood. The character development, with the exception of the mother, was fairly weak. I also couldn't seem to define a cohesive plot. I think this book would have worked better as a series of short stories."
3,Great overview; No explication.,"This DVD starts with Li Bingci demonstrating the first 10 movements of the Wu Long Form, but that's the last thing he does in it. Students demonstrate the long form, the competition form, the sword form, and the saber form. The video is subtitled in English, but awkwardly; however, that doesn't hamper its prime purpose, which is simply to show the assorted Wu forms, performed well. This is NOT an instructional video; there are a number of videos in this series which are, however.Single camera, one angle, no frills. A visual record of the forms and that's all."
3,a not-so-excellent debut from an excellent band,"as reviewers are so fond of saying, ""this one is for the fans"". while the formula that later gave rise to a masterful band is all here, it is not executed well enough to be noteworthy. while there is indeed some excellent material on this release, it can also become a tedious bore rather quickly, especially for people who are not fans of eyehategod or of sludge in general. this is definitely not a very good starting point for a new listener; for that, check out their last two albums, Dopesick and Confederacy of Ruined Lives, instead."
1,Extraordinarily boring,"Very slow, extremely dry music. Listening to this is listening to boredom incarnate. After hearing this album, I can only hope their later stuff is better. I won't be buying any of their other albums though. This stuff is dry and empty music! It's devoid of all life."
1,Unpleasantly Suprised,"The first time I put this CD on and advanced through the tracks I thought my stereo was broken. But it turns out every track started with the same feedback tone and proceeded into crummy riffage that permeated every tune. Don't get me wrong, I like doom / death metal. But this album is a poor attempt."
2,MAE WEST IS WONDERFUL ON THIS ALBUM!,"I bought this CD strictly for the fact that it had Mae West singing ""A Guy What Takes His Time"".It's a purely sexy song and once you adjust it on your stereo, cd player, etc., the sound is phenomenol.In addition, there ARE other versions of this song that Mae West made recordings of, but it is THIS album that has the best version of ""A Guy What Takes His Time"". It's got a lot of sultriness to it, a lot of giggle."
3,a good book from the bravo series,"i love the bravo series and this book is up to par. the story was ok, it kept me on my toes and really spent an entire day reading it until the last page. i felt the heroine in this book was a masochist from the very start and it pained me to know the lengths that she went through to get the guy, i.e. asking him to marry her to save the ranch, still accepting him even when he made her leave L.A. when he finally knew she was pregnant and all that. there are other books from the bravo series that calls more deserved attention like ""the MD she had to marry"". it's still worth reading though."
2,Very Tiny,"These are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys. They have a diameter of about 3/4 of an inch. I wanted to put aprons on them, but they are not big enough, nor strong enough. They have a micro sized magnet on the back that is strong for its tiny appearance."
1,"Yeah, don't buy these","These magnets are definitely not strong enough to be worthwhile, even for light objects. Try the ones rated for 25 lbs... even though that's probably overkill for your needs, at least you'll KNOW that they're adequate for any task."
1,Small and Ineffective,Magnets on the back of these hooks are very small and not strong enough to hold up very much. They could not support the weight of my oven mits. Would not buy again or recommend them.
3,too small to be useful fridge magnets,"These hooks are nice but small -- 1"" in diameter, which was difficult to tell from the photo provided. They weren't strong enough to use in the kitchen to hang oven mitts off of the refrigerator. I'm not sure what they would be useful for. They're attractive on the front side, but on the back, the magnet is very cheaply glued on."
2,"look good, but not functional for anything involving much weight","These magnets look good from the front, but suffer from design flaw and poor assembly:-- the magnets may be strong, but they're entirely too small for the purpose here: they stick out far enough that if you put any weight at all on teh hook, it levers off the surface and slides down or falls off-- the magnets are bonded to the hook with a brown epoxy that is sometimes sloppily applied, and they are often off-center. (see image provided)They do work well for holding up a pen or pencil horizontally (two of them, side by side)."
2,Super Tiny,"While the magnet is strong for its size, they magnets themselves are too small for the size of the hook. The hook is the right size for my cubicle needs, but not near strong enough to hold up the wind breaker I bought it for. It does however hold lighter items well. Not a horrible product, but would be much more useful if the magnet behind clip was larger by at least 4x."
2,Undersized magnets,"The actual magnets are +/- 1/4"" in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things. Did not work for my 6 keys plus a car fob.The hooks look good though. That said, I am sending them back."
1,Magnets are weak,I was very disappointed in these. The magnets are extremely weak. Don't purchase these if you need to hang anything heavier than a single key.
3,Strong but not THAT strong,"These compact magnets sound too good to be true and do actually look nice in-person, but they don't hold the weight. I wanted to hang hot mits on my fridge, but it took some finagling to get it to stay and I could only put one mit per hook."
1,I threw these away. Not remotely strong enough,"I bought some earth magnets at the same time as these, and they are about 100 times more powerful. These might hold a paper. Might, on a nice flag metal surface.These are not even in the same category but oh SO much nicer: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040MPB80I just used some of the above to hang halloween docrations from my ""walls"". Presumably there is a nail or something they are attracted to.This item is not worth buying."
2,"Hooks fine, magnets weak",Needs larger stronger magnets. I replaced them and now they work? Manufacture needs to upgrade to a larger diameter magnet
3,They do the job - sort of,"They are smaller than I had imagined (I suppose it's my fault for not more closely reviewing the specs). They work for small sets of keys (2 keys), and lightweight kitchen towels/hot pads/oven mitts - otherwise they just slide down whatever you stuck them to."
5,Great fridge magnets,"Rounding up from a 4 1/2 for this one. I do with the hooks were slightly bigger, but they are great. I keep these on my fridge. In a small apartment, I make use of every space, and these let me store a few kitchen gadgets (tongs, colander, mesh strainer) in an attractive way while maximizing my space. They hold great - don't expect anything out of this world, but I keep a light metal colander with no problem. It is a thin handled one, otherwise it wouldn't fit on the small hooks."
1,Essentially useless.,"The magnets are about 1/4"" across and are too weak to hold up a dog leash or anything else useful."
3,"Small, cute and nice for lightweight items","I purchased these hooks specifically for the purpose of hanging potholders on the magnetic fridge. They work but you have to gently hang them to prevent the hooks from sliding down. They may, however, work better on other magnetized surfaces. They are tiny and cute but I would not recommend using them as refrigerator magnets."
1,"weak magnets, tiny hooks",These really are not as described. They are tiny hooks on a not-terribly-magnetic backing. Two hooks together could not hold up one thin apron.Very disappointed.
1,not as described or shown,"When I read the prior reviews I was excited to get these hooks to use on my refrigerator to hang dish towels. When I received them there were no magnets just sticky stuff on the back. Also the items sent were cheap and bent easily nothing like the photo shown. Don't waste your time if you are looking for magnets, or maybe the company sent me the wrong item I don't know. But I was quite disappointed, I will be returning them."
1,hold up what exactly?,"these are the weakest magnets i have ever seen on any hook. ""rare earth"" they're tiny and wont hold a paperclip up. not a complete waste, because i'm going to rip the crap magnets off, and put on real rare earth magnets. then maybe they will hold up the dish towel i bought them for."
3,Poor vertical strength,"The magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal surface.Unfortunately, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame. My frame is an 8x11 docuement with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards."
1,Do not work,"Would not hold any weight. All 5 of them together can not hold one lightweight apron, just slide down. I am sending these back."
4,"Good, but not as magnetic as I had hoped","I bought these hooks to be able to hang aprons on the side of the fridge, but the magnetic power just isn't very strong and they easily slide."
2,Much smaller and weaker than they look,"Very small hooks with a even smaller magnet! I wanted some actual strength! They are maybe 3/4"" diam - the photo is zoomed way in."
2,not a good product,"I ordered the magnetic hooks thinking they would be like two I already own. The ones I own are bigger AND the magnet cover the entire back. These are small--not quite one inch in diameter. The bigger problem is that the magnet on the back is not the same size. The magnet is about 1/4 inch in diameter. One tea towel is ok to hang on it, if I am very careful. The items I had hanging from my old, bigger magnetic hook hangers take these new one right down the side of the refrigerator to the floor."
4,does the job,does the job and is fairly attractive.. i'd buy it again. It's very bright though so make sure you need lots of light!
5,"My goodness - Really, REALLY beautiful music","Hi gang. If you're like me, you're always on the lookout for those very special CD's that really flood both your mind and heart with the wonderful aroma and color that is unique to really good music. As a professional programmer, I have to listen to music when I program or I'll go absolutely nuts. This CD is really something. I've only had it a few days but I've already listened to it countless times. If you appreciate creative and beautiful arrangements of really nice music, you'll surely enjoy this CD as much as I do. First class stuff. Enjoy!"
5,Crisp and quietly exhilerating,"Unlike many New Age compositions which strive to be dramatic with extended pauses and silence, this CD achieves its drama by layering exciting rythms with enticing harmonies.This is a CD to be ""listened to"". The music is not content to be played in the background while reading the newspaper. If you try, you'll find yourself reaching for the volume to turn it up. It is masterfully crafted to be soothing and exciting at the same time. It's a perfect cross between Danny Wright and the Rippingtons."
4,Asus A7N8X-X,"Was looking for a board to use an AMD Athlon XP 2400 that I had when I found this deal. The board fit the bill perfectly and was the right price. Made use of the CPU that had been on the shelf for months and made a better computer for the grandkids.The board lacked some of the bells and whistles of others I have used, but all in all was a good deal. I like the Asus product line and have had very good luck using their products."
3,A pleasant surprise,"Most New-Agey type ""picturebooks"" with few pages and much white space, which consist of a few sayings are a bunch of garbage. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the Zen quotes selected for this one were actually interesting and valid. Some of the images set the tone well, others are just fillers.Get it if you want to be exposed to a wide range of quotes many of which will probably be new and if you can find the book for a good price as there's only so much content a small 60 page picture book can have."
3,Learned a lesson.,"Should have read the fine print. The item took a long time to arrive which shorted us a Father's Day gift for Dad. Ordered & paid for on the July 2nd, didn't arrive until the 25th. Inconsistant shipping info: Seller profile states usually ships 1 to 2 days, shipping info states it may take 1 to 2 weeks. When contacting the seller, they apologized and pasted their 1 to 2 week shipping policy in the email. The item took over 3 weeks to arrive, again, missing our Father's Day deadline. Also looked as if their were 2 items in the picture when it was depicting front and back is same photo. A bit spendy and arrived slightly damaged."
1,Blank DVD,"I was so excited to watch some footage of the Cat when I received it in the mail. When I got it in my DVD player, it wouldn't read the disc. I then went over to my Labtop and attempted to play it there. It still wouldn't play. After that I was very suspicous and used my labtop to read the disc and its properties. It turned out it was a completely blank disc with no information on it whatsoever. So now I have a perfectly blank DVD with a fancy label and case. NICE. I then sent a few emails to the company -stickpo@yahoo.com- however received no reply."
5,Best bag I found,"I have several camera bags and this by far is the move versatile I own and my standard bag for out and about. It easily handles my Nikon D50 with 3 lenses and a flash. I have room for extra batteries etc.The top compartment was great for carrying my Gortex jacket, sun glasses, power cords and chargers, as well as a baseball cap and more.It's light enough to carry all day, doesn't make you look too much like a tourist.If you are considering this - you should also look at the Adventure 9 (#5549). I don't have that one yet, but other than the extra ""weight"", it looks like another alternative."
2,not good for long lens,"The ads is misleading, it can not match the need for a photographer with long lens. Look at the demo image in product description, What I can tell you is these two lens are all medium length.long lens+body > height of bottom apartment plus 4 inch.So you can not put the lens-attached SLR vertically like the demo image shows.long lens+body = width of bottom apartment.example: a 70-300mm lens attached to SLR camera, i have to either put it in top apartment (which is assumed to hold jackets, lunch and other stuffs according to ads), or i have to remove all ""wall""s from the bottom apartment to lay down the camera and leaving ""un-walled"" little space for two medium-size lens."
4,Safari Pack,"This is a well made pack and has a surprising amount of room for its size. Once I got used to it, it was comfortable to wear. I used it for a Canon 12 G small camera, a Canon Rebel body and a Sigma 18 to 200mm lens plus batteries, cards, etc. All fit in the bottom designated camera area but the pack was more comfotable to wear when I wrapped the heavy Sigma lens and placed it in the top compartment.I used this mostly in a Safari vehicle to shoot animals in Africa. I did not walk around much with it.Jean HansonPS. I am a senior, 76 yrs old, about 5'7"" and 130 lbs. Pack was purchased at a discount price (in like-new condition) from Amazon.com."
5,Just What I Was Looking For,Backpack was received on time and in good condition. I wanted a pack to carry on an upcoming trip where I'll be going on tours during the day. It provides a cushioned place for my camera and long lens as well as other lenses and photo equipment. It's also got an area for packing other items to carry during the day. Fits in a standard aircraft overhead too.
4,Day Trip Bag,Well built bag that is good for a day trip. Bottom holds all my gear that I need. Only thing missing is a holder for my tripod. Top holds food and an extra jacket or raingear. Would recomend for someone looking for a good day trip bag or a carry on for airplane. If you have a laptop this not the bag.
5,Adventure 7,"Great Backpack! It is well made, padded straps and back. I have a Canon 20D with grip and about four smaller lenses in the bottom. I do have to keep my Canon 70-200 2.8L in the top section with a lens wrap around it."
4,convenient but small.,"It's a hip, compact bag, but the fitting is a bit too snug. My camera hardly fits in the slot for it, and kind of sticks out a bit, but still fits fine once closed. I use mine to carry around my Rebel xti, two lenses and a few accessories, and so far all of my gear has been fine.If you want a bag thats easy to carry, and don't need a whole lot of space for all of your gear and lenses. This is for you."
2,Almost Quality,"The main clasp for the bottom part isn't perfect... it's slightly bent and requires some manipulation to ""click."" The tripod's great, the cleaning kit's great. Be careful about that front clasp. It was shipped quickly though."
4,Excellent photo bag!,"I purchased this bag before going to NYC. I wanted something to carry not only my photo equipment, but also some personal items. It's very well made with good padding for the camera and lenses."
4,Put all DSLR into one location,"I used this bag to hold all my DSLR stuff. However, it is not big enough for more than 2 lenses. It is small enough to carry it around."
4,"All I need, nothing I don't","This is the second Tamrac backpack photo case I've purchased. I looked at the quality of the material, stitching and padding. Zippers never failed in the four years I owned the first one. I like traveling light in hunting and fishing areas. It held photo gear, rainwear and lunch as well as cameras, telephoto and macro lenses. It was always well balanced,plenty of pockets to keep the gear secure and held up to briars, branches and rocks. That's why this is my second one."
3,more review!,This is a good storage bag but not good for getting quick access to the camara. The Velocity 7 back is much better if you want something that allow you to get access to your camara quickly and also able to carry most of your camara equipment with you.I returned this bag and purchased the Velocity 7 bag. Loved the Velocity 7 bag.
4,Perfect for the day hike,"I was very happy to see the size of this backpack. It is perfect for holding my digital slr, lenses and accessories. The top storage compartment isn't big, but sufficient."
4,Good general bag for amateur or novice shooter,"I got this bag one year ago and now have used it in just about every condition possible. As a outdoor photographer I would say for non-professional use it is a good bag. However, for professionals it is not going to work. It has no tripod holding (although some Manfrotto tripods have a loop below the head that will allow you to stick two feet in the side pocket and attach the loop to the top handle on the bag with a clasp or d-ring). It also does not hold many lenses. A canon XTi with a 70-200mm is about all you will fit in the top. For a day pack or two lens set up and no tripod it is really good bag. But not for professional use. I still use it for quick hikes and like the bag. It is also a great backpack just to have around the house for general use. enjoy!"
5,Video Review for Tamrac Adventure 7 - Love This Pack,"Length:: 3:27 MinsWhen I was researching bags and backpacks I had a hard time visualizing what I could actually fit in a bag. This video covers the Tamrac Adventure 7 photo backpack showing how much room the bag has with two lenses, a camera body plus lens and a flash."
4,"Very good bag, more space would be better","I like this bag very much, it can hold my SLR body along with 2 lens, even with one 70-300mm, although bit hard to fit in well. I would expect it little bit bigger, however current size looks perfect if carry out for causal travel. And the bag is good quality and solid. Nice backpack."
4,review of camera bag and tripod,the camera bag has worked really well for me. its so nice to have places that i can put more lenses that are not attached to my camera.only complaint so far is with the really cheap tripod bag. ive only taken or moved the tripod bag maybe 10 times and the shoulder strap is just barely holding onto the top of bag
5,The Complete Videographer's Guide to Legal Video Taping,One of the most concise and comprehensive books ever written on the subject of legal videography. A great asset to those who want to enter the field of forensics videography and video court depositions and related work.
5,225 pages of frustration for gun control advocates,"Using all the available data, John Lott asks -- and, alas for the advocates of ""gun control"" answers -- the question: What effects do laws permitting competent, law-abiding adults to receive handgun carry permits have?The answer is, manifestly: to reduce violent crime.Which is why the gun control advocates are reduced to the sort of handwaving that several of the scoffing reviewers engage in here."
2,"Great statistics, but not a very fun read.","Yes- as everyone says, Lott's study is detailed, comprehensive and based on real evidence. However, it is NOT a fun read by any means. Nearly half the book is ""as this regression shows..."" and the like-monotonous and uninteresting after a while. If you're looking for something to read in relation to math or statistics course, grab this book; it's a gem in that cateogry. If you're just looking for something to read, there are many other books as stimulating that are much more entertaining."
1,Puzzled European,"I think I should read this book. ""This timely and provocative work comes to the startling conclusion: more guns mean less crime."" I have always wondered why we Europeans drown in crime but there is pretty much no such thing here in the US?Just from my personal observation:32 years of living in Germany:Burglaries experienced: 1Murders heard about in city I lived in: 0Fatal hit and run crimes heard about in city I lived in: 0Property thefts experienced: 07 years of living in US:Burglaries experienced: 1Murders heard about in immediate neighborhood: 2Fatal hit and run crimes heard about in city I lived in: too many to countProperty thefts experienced: 5 or moreI think I should also read, ""More Cigarettes, Less Cancer,"" or, ""More Pollution, Healthier Children."""
5,A Scientific Analysis superceding emotional issue.,"A very academic and dry read, except for the introduction and a few parts of the book.I loved it, because it is so CORRECTLY politically incorrect!"
4,In-depth look at the truth behind legal firearms and crime,"Finally, a study that can open the eyes of Gun Control advocates to the truth about lawful gun ownership...if only they could look beyond their biases and actually read it. John Lott Jr.'s study of firearms ownership is packed full of statistics and explanations of why gun control actually helps increase crime by making criminals, and not law abiding citizens, feel safer on our streets. Everyone can benefit from reading this book. Overall, I found this to be a very informative book. Some areas that were heavy with statistics and graphs were a somewhat slow read but, in the end, John Lott's conclusions were informative and help remove the veil of lies, misinformation, and scare tactics that the media and Gun control advocates have used to blind the general population."
5,In Depth numbers analysis,"Most of us have given up on statistics. They've been manipulated so often that few of us trust them anymore.John Lott took the same statistics we hear arguments over and broke them down into as many specifics as he could. In some areas, data just didn't exist to support either side of this debate. He notates accordingly what he found, very dutifully I might add.What you have is a book that gives you specifics on numbers, the comparisons (as they can be made) and some startling conclusions -- startling even to pro gunners.This topic is filled with bogus and questionable statistics, on both sides. John Lott brought the indifferent academic mindset back in play and gave us some real information to work with."
5,"Hartford, Ct. is wrong","Actually, I haven't read the book. But the reviewer from Hartford, Ct. is wrong on his statistics. Bigger samples are only more reliable if they are drawn from the same population. By his standards, a comparison of Switzerland, where all adult males have guns, with New York City, where, theoretically, few adult males have them, would show an even stronger negative correlation between guns and crime."
1,But his data is false,"I was completely persuaded by this book when I read it over ten years ago. It seemed irrefutable. Then I read about his 1997 hard drive crash which wiped all the data he cited in his book, so he couldn't demonstrate his work to other scholars. Then I read other scholars reviewing the same types of data that Lott claimed that he used for his analysis. Their analyses showed different conclusions. So in the end, it turns out this book proves nothing. Even though the central idea is logical that criminals would rather target people without guns than people with guns, Lott just doesn't prove it with review-able statistics, and his work is pretty much discredited by real academics. Potential purchasers should know that. They could also google ""John Lott Mary Rosh"" to discover a little about how controversial a character Lott is."
4,"Great information, but difficult, laborious reading","""More Guns Less Crime"" is brutally detailed in its facts and figures: Regressions, scatter diagrams, means, standard deviations, whew! It's enough to make the non-initiated's head swim.The book has great info showing the reduction in crime as related to increasing handgun ownership and right-to-carry permits. However, I found the reading so laborious that it detracted from the message being conveyed. It was downright boring at times, for pages on end.But if you are up to the task, ""More Guns Less Crime"" is a scholarly, academic work. If you love facts, figures, and charts, this is for you! (Perhaps you are a sociologist, economist, statistician, math whiz?) If you prefer the more ""human"" side of the gun debate issue (case studies, would-be victim testimonals, etc.) you will be less than satisfied."
1,In whose interests was this book written?,"Not a good book, erroneous research that lead to dubious conclusions. Buy only if you agree with the aims of the NRA!"
2,Be rational,"Not all gun regulations are bad. Use your head, otherwise we just hurt our cause.""It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."
1,Review the reviewers,"Poorly researched and using fictional statistics, this book is a great example of how NOT to do research!Look at the reviews here on Amazon, reviewers who highly rate the book provide no credentials while those who pan the book seem to represent experts in field.Better put, if you already know all the answers and ""won't let things like FACTS stand in your way,"" this book is for you. If you are a participant in the debate HONESTLY, regardless of side, this book should be avoided."
