4,Does what it's supposed to,"On the other hand, it makes your poo smell really bad, and if you take the recommended dose, it often causes severe constipation. Beware!"
5,"Quick, correct, what I needed, and a good price","I needed this book for a class and try to get either new or like new books for any text I foresee keeping or needing in the future. This book came within a week with standard shipping, was the item I needed, in like new (I wouldn't have been able to tell if it had not been it is in very good condition), and most importantly was a great price."
3,Very simple,I used this book for a bioinformatics class and I also worked as a biotechnology programmer for around 8 years. It is a simple well written introduction to some topics in bioinformatics. But it not high level enough to use a reference for my work; but a introduction is probably what the author intended.
3,Soft but Loose,"I own a lot of Gold Toe products and normally love their socks. These socks, however, are a bit different from their usual ones. They don't have a lot of stretch, so you put them on and they just sorta ""hang out"" on your foot. This causes them to sag and move around."
1,Are you kidding?,"I have been wearing the same gold-toe socks for what seems like 10 years. I finally caved in and ordered new ones (the Bermuda Turn Cuff - the Crew Athletic didn't come in black). What a major disappointment! These are no where near the quality of my old socks. You other reviewers have got to be kidding!? (Or else they sent me a completely different item.) The quality is so poor it makes me think they've outsourced their product to China, really. I can literally see my hand through the heel. The toe has a thick band on top and is uncomfortable with and without shoes. I am so sad to be having to find a new manufacturer. Priced at over 4 bucks a pair, DON'T DO IT. You can find the same quality at discount stores for less money. (I've never reviewed an item before but was so disappointed in this item I was compelled to write.)"
2,Returned,"I have purchased Gold Toe socks in the past and liked them. However, these were knit from a coarse, rough yarn that felt a bit abrasive on my feet. They have a thick, course seam across the toe that bothered me barefoot, much more so inside a shoe. No thanks -- trying something else..."
2,"Comfortable, but didn't last.","The socks are a comfortable medium-weight cotton, and not too tight on thick ankles. Great for every-day use, but not for too long- they started to wear thin after eight months and before a year was out, they had to be thrown out because of the big holes. Gold Toe used to make great socks... these were definitely a disappointment."
3,Way too eclectic for me.,"I fully enjoyed Break You Off, The Seed (2.0), Complexity (Their best song EVER), P.U.S.S.Y. Galore and Something In The Way Of Things which is quirky and scary. VERY scary sounding.For that it gets a 3 star rating.The production is on point for these songs. I like their lyrics for the most part too. Black Thought seems to be very intelligent. But I can't get past the fact that this CD is just too weird for me to listen to it regularly. Things Fall Apart was the same way, except it wasn't *this* weird!3.4 stars."
4,Phrenology......A study in music....str8 from the roots!!,"The roots took it on a different level this time around which is something I like. Well when you look at the steps they made they always try to take it one step forward with every new project. This album brings it all tho....rock, a lil reggae, blues and R+B all on one live mix of tight beats and rythms that keep you listening all the way through. Songs I was feeling here:*Break You off*Rock You*Thought@work*The Seed(2.0) -- this is the song right here*water*Quills*P**y Galore*Something in the way of LoveThey came on a very abstract vibe this time around while still using a famailr sound everyone knows. Anyone trying to hear hip-hop on a not so typical level with more deeper lyrics.....on a more alternative vibe should check this out.Get it!"
1,Total Junk,"I have been a Roots fan for 9 years and this album couldn't tie the shoe laces nor wipe ""Do you Want More's"" rear end. This album possesses two tracks at least. The problem with most of the reviews that are positive is that they are probably written by early to mid twenty year olds whose ears are so used to the garbage on the radio that this slight improvement as reflected by this album seems like Nirvana to them. Buy Do You Want More and Iladelph Halflife play them several times and then play this album several times and then compare and contrast. The Roots wanted to make money because in making music, art was stating to imitate life too much, and they weren't making any money. So they became commercial as a result you get garbage product like Phrenology. The Roots need to get off the musical swine and keep it real!"
1,what are some artist trying to do to hip hop?,"i thought that of all the hip hop artist out there i would be able to count on the roots to keep hip hop real, but i was wrong. the roots have jumped on that bandwagon that releases that radio garbage. if you want to hear roots at their best get illedelph halflife that is truely a great album. dont get me wrong, the roots have a ton of talent, it is just that they didn't use it for this album. as soon as you see nelly furtado as one of the features you know that something is up. go pick up gangstarrs new album ""ownerz"" or large professors, those are real artistic hip hop."
2,Maybe two tracks,"Sacrifice and maybe number 11 are half-way decent. The rest literally are horrible when compared to the three previous albumns. Wow, especially that Talib Kwali song - it sounded like a corny nursery rhyme with a hip-hop beat.da-da---da-da--da-da--da-da--duh-duh-duh--duh has been like a herpes outbreak that just won't go away."
2,Very average for the roots,"There are two songs that i really like: Water and hidden track no 17, that doesn't appear on this tracklist. If you want to check some really standout stuff by the roots check Illadelph Halflife (his best cd in my opinion) and Things Fall Apart."
1,Hey you guys! What happened?,"I had thought that these guys had come a long ways since Illadelph...but when i think about it, maybe not. Do You Want More was by far the greatest Roots Cd they ever recorder. Things Fall Apart went a little down hill as the roots started getting into ""harder"" beats. This Phrenology junk though, is taking it too hard. All the songs sound like any other song played on BET or MTV these days...all exactly the same. What happened to the originality? What happened to the jazz? what happened? Just download a couple songs from this album and see what i mean...if anything, buy Do You Want More before you buy Phrenology...unless you're into that BET shi*."
2,so dissapointed,"ok....ummm....what the hell happened?? how can a group go from something so good...to so bad...so fast?? I'm not even trying to compare this to ""illadelph halflife"" or ""do you want more??!??""...or even the more recent ""things fall apart"".. This is...at best..a poor attempt to get into the main stream. The only good tracks are the ones with talib kweli...the ""seed 2.0"" crap is horrible pop non-sense. The ""tipping point"" album was SO much better. This is the weak link. So....download..don't pay....i can't believe i said this...but its sooo true.."
1,Subpar,"This album lacks the zest, the instrumental appeal and everything else their previous albums included. I was very disappointed!!"
1,No Thanks...,"I bought this album they day it hit the shelves in the UK, and damn was I disapointed. I pray that this album is just a ""vanilla release"" to get The Roots out of a bad record deal, because this is awful.Theres a bad imitation of a PUNK tune on their, guests like Nelly Furtado!! What more else do I need to say.The breaks and beats were awful, and it is very difficult to actually here much of the lyrics.Rest assured that my copy of ""Phrenology"" is sitting gathering dust in my local used record store.Avoid this album unless you like strange Rap/Rock fusions and wasting your hard earnt cash..."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This CD only has 11 songs on it. ... The first is an intro, There's a poor iteration of a PUNK track on there, WAOK roll call is a pointless track, and that hidden song is, well, while you can count it as a song, I can't hear it. On my setup, the annoying breakbeats are too loud, and you have to strain to hear the lyrics.These people get an A for effort, but I was looking for some semi-underground sounds. Instead i got Jazzy beats. I should have known that if their guests are people like Musiq Soulchild and Nelly Furtado. If you like that, cool, but if you like listenin to the local rappers, then this isn't what you want.My impression of this CD: It's just a bunch of black people running around doing what they want, not trying to be anything.Oh, yeah, and ""illadelphia""? I laughed out loud at that. I still can't tell if they're trying to be serious when they say that."
5,Phrenology.....well worth your $$!!!,"Phrenology is a must have. The Legendary Roots Crew was been in existents or a long time and if you have never purchased any of their music this is the time to do so. Phrenology features drop in from artist such as Nelly Furtado, Musiq, Talib Kweli, Jill Scott and the legendary Cody Chesnutt. The Roots are true musicians and sound as good live as they do in their album (which is a rare quality for artist now a days). The Roots have created a classic Hip Hop album, which delivers rhyme and instrumental skills...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM ...IT A YEAR'S MUST GET!!!!"
3,Caught up in a....mix up of....Phrenology.,This album by The Roots is mix bag of songs. I totally like it when artists do different stuff and keep tight. Tracks like Quills and Break You Off (Musiq) keep it real and have tha groove. But sadly this album goes in a mix of....uhm $#%@. Why would they do something like Sacrifice(Nelly Furtado= weak artist) and a crappy track take it back.Plus the Rock You over and over and over again Yuck!! Overall not a good/bad album just a little odd.
5,They've done it again,"The Roots new album Phrenology is the real deal. No hip hop group has it together like The Roots. They combine elements of all different types of music that create a sound that is purely original with no equal. Black Thought's flow is amazing and the group holds it down as they remain the only hip hop group to successfully hold down their own music. The Seed is an amazing song and its vibe is a new style of rock, r&b, hip hop, soul and funk. I didn't think they could do it for the fifth time with this album but they did it. This is the best one yet, even better than illadelph halflife."
5,2002's best in hip hop,"The Roots ""Phrenology"" is one of the greatest hip hop albums released this decade. They are a rare rap band. They blend rap, R&B, dance, and rock. Black Thought raps his lyrics very emotionally and very powerfully. He forces the audience to feel what he's rapping whether it's anger, love, or strong polital issues. Every instrument played by the band blends perfectly with its theme and environment. Their guest artists: Musiq, Jill Scott, Talib Kweli, Nelly Furtado, and Cody Chestnutt; add that special chemistry to their particular tracks. ""Phrenology"" is a great album for all fans and non-fans of hip-hop. Their musical variety allows the further audience appeal. Also, those who are tired of the same ole music played on mainstream radio will enjoy this escape. This album proves that The Roots will continue to entertain for a long time."
2,What happened?,They lost me on this one. I love the roots but this album was really a disappointment. I only played this twice and really did not see a reason to play it a third time
2,Not as impressed....,"with the rest of the album as I was when listening to ""The Seed (2.0)"" on the radio. It's infectious groove pulled me in, but the rest of the tracks do nothing for me. I realize these guys have lots of talent.....just not for my sensibilities."
5,oh yes - the roots,"ive heard a lot of good things about the roots in the past but it wasnt until mtv actually played something good when i got to see them perform in concert. a day later i had this cd. these guys are so different from the bulls*** hip hop that is popular today. these guys dont sing about money and women the way all these big time rappers with no skills do. instead they talk about things that are important such as the media influence on music. also these guys have an actual band. the roots have been around for awhile and have got fans by a lot of hard work. black thought is one of the best lyricists in the rap game and drummer ?uestlove is the man. phrenology in a great album with great original songs. some of my favs were thought@work, the seed(2.0) and quills. put this cd on and let other people hear and know about true hip hop. buy this cd"
4,NOVEL EXPERIENCE (4.5 STARS),"The Roots have taken their music to yet another level with Phrenology. The mode of Phrenology is that of creativity and experimentation. The sounds are the most eclectic I've heard since Miles Davis' ""B****'s Brew,"" ie. ""Water"" and ""Intown."" This cd is like gumbo; it has a little bit of everything: rock, hip hop, rap, jazz, and new age all fused together for one hell of a musical collage.I've been bumpin' this cd since I got it and the only song I skip is ""The Seed"" with Cody Chestnut (just not feelin' the lyrics).Standout tracks:-Break You Off w/Musiq (tight track, Musiq has that Marvin Gaye falsetto going).-Sacrifice w/Nelly Furtado-Water (talks about the dangers of drugs; the end has futuristic fusion).-P***y Galore w/Tracey Moore (title says it all)!!!-Complexity w/Jill Scott (hypnotic music blend).If you like atypical music, excellent instrumentation, and tight rhymes you want to cop ""PHRENOLOGY,"" these kats are pioneers in this genre.-"
3,"The Roots are Moving from Their ""Roots""","I remember in 1992 (or there about) tripping up in a record store and taking my last 20 bills to take a risk on CD of a group who I had heard spittin' on another compilation CD. It turned out to be paydirt--a whole new genre of rap. I didn't have to have watered down rhymes to have a live band rockin' it. Now the Roots have drum machines and all types of electronica. This record is not a progression it sorta the opposite. They still rock the cuts where they are true to the genre they popularized and the rhymes are still tight, but cuts like the Nelly Furtada--what is that about??? Come on bros keep the ...cuts coming and stay true to your ROOTS!"
4,Complete,"I've bought this album like three times it something for every listener R&B, old school hip hop, little rock you name it"
3,Have not tryed it yet,I play the piano and am looking for a small piano that i can use when I go on trips. I hope it is durabal and can hold batteries. If not thats ok too.I will still try it out and wright a real review. :)(PS I raited it wright in the middle 'cuz i dont know yet sorry)
1,Who can afford it?,However good this book is it's not worth $43. The publisher should be ashamed for keeping this valuable informative work out of students' hands.
3,HAPPY!,We were very happy with the condition of the book. We liked the fact that the seller email us. The book arrived on time. We will look forward to other purchases from this site.
5,An alternative to Chariots of the Gods,"Published in 1972, during the peak of the ancient astronaut craze, Mysteries From Forgotten Worlds covers the same topics as Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods, i.e. Easter Island, the Great Pyramid, the Nazca lines, the lost city of Nan Madol, Tiahuanaco, Sacsayhuaman, and the Bimini wall. But instead of aliens being responsible for constructing these things, as von Daniken claimed, Berlitz thinks they are the remnants of a lost civilization."
5,hidden objects,So much fun finding hidden object. Its addictive. Rooms change all the time so its like a new game every time you go back
4,review by MS,"The tape counter seems to count in seconds and this is not very standard for these systems. The unit is nice for the price but I would have liked to see an ONKYO "" INTEGRA"" line quality."
4,does the job well,"would rather buy a good 3 head deck like the old days, but this does what I need it to do, play a bunch of old cassettes. Sounds good"
3,Very Good stand out tape deck,"One of the last great tape desk left in the market for converting cassettes to cds and ipod and believe me there is not many left to do this transition with good play back recording, only disadvantage I find is there is not pitch control button to adjust your cassette speed, especially for the D.J. out there who like to change speed on the music, otherwise it works great.Terry"
2,Top Rated Failure,"Worked as expected for awhile. Just after the warranty ran out with no more than 10 hours of use, this player/recorder simply quit recognizing a tape. It is waiting for the scrap pile."
3,too new to really tell,First impression - buttons feel hard and clunky when pushed. This does not inspire confidence.I really have not had the chance to use this very much yet. Therefore I do not feel comfortablerating this product at this time.
3,Onkyo TARW255 Dual well Tape Deck - the review,"this was purchased as a gift, to facilitate the conversion of cassettes to mp3 and ripping cd's.i have always liked onkyo products, as they tend to be very solid. what made this purchase stellar for me was the auto-reverse feature. now when ripping cassettes its just play and let nature run its course. ok, not so much nature, but a piece of equipment that gets the job done. both wells have auto reverse. you can also have to tapes play on relay, in other words, press play on one and then the other will begin to play when the first one ends. also it has remote control connection jack in the back, i won't need it, since it's hooked up to a pc."
1,WORST ELECTRONICS EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!,"Horrible deck coupled with atrocious service. Within the first month, it ceased working and Onkyo told me it was a problem of theirs. Thankfully, instead of having to mail it at my expense to an authorized repair center, Amazon exchanged the deck. Two months later, same problem. Customer service was cold, clearly not interested in my problem and handed me the standard answer. Now I have have to pay $20 or more to ship a deck that cost me a bit over $100. I would never buy an Onkyo product again. This could not have been a worse experience, and waste of money. Just horrible!"
1,Onkyo deck purchased for school music room,"This deck was purchased for a general music classroom. It did not work out of the box but unfortunately was past the 30 day period when it was tested out. One would not expect a basic tape deck to not be able to play or record cassettes, but it appears to be a fairly common problem with a sensor in the unit. We are now trying to deal with a service center in another state and are out money for shipping on a brand new unit. Poor experience with Onkyo."
5,Great item.,"I have used this to make a couple holes in my sanke kegs and it works great. There is minimal dulling to the bit after about 5-6 kegs now. The price is great and beats anything else you will find out there at the bigger brick and mortar stores. They want 5X as much for a similar item. If you are a homebrewer and need to make a few holes i your kegs or kettles, get this!"
4,Decent product for a good price,"Amazon to the rescue when I needed to drill some large holes in the sills of my track car for the roll cage mounting points. No step drill this large was available locally, but Amazon shipped it to me quickly, and I was able to complete my project. Sharp drill bit and it stayed sharp even after drilling 10 holes."
3,Ehh.. cheap price... dulls quickly,I only needed it to drill one hole in a piece of stainless sheet metal.. Slow speed with cutting fluid.. It's now dull. It did what I needed it to do.. but I should have spent more so I could have used it down the road! Chinese Junk
2,Cheap,I bought this bit hoping to save some money but it ended up costing another 35.00 to go get a klien bit at HD to get the job done.Dont buy 4 stainless brew kettle. Fast shipping tho
2,Step Drill Bit...sorta,"It looks like a step bit, feels like a step bit, but does not cut like a step bit should. I bought this thing to drill 3 holes in a 55 gallon steel drum. Used cutting fluid to try to keep the bit cool and lubricate it but even then it just vibrated, overheated, and did just enough cutting to barely make the holes I needed. Not only that, but the hole sizes were not accurate due to the poor quality of the bit. I guess you get what you pay for, in the future I'll buy a name brand product."
3,Made in CHINA - NOT USA,"WARNING: deceptive advertising. ""Neiko tools USA"" is actually made in China, not the USA. Buyer beware! Too bad they have to lie about where their products are made"
3,Item came Quickly,I used this product for a purpose the drill is not made for.I needed to drill a 5/8 hole and a 3/4 hole in thicker steel thanit said the drill was to be used for and took the edge off. I should of purchased a 5/8 and a 3/4 bit for drilling steel but they are hard to find and so expensive. Also why does ever thing have to be made in China.D.B.
1,"Didn""t Like it...",I used the step bit on my brew kettle which was made of 304 stainless steel. After the first four steps it was useless. I had to get my rotory file out to finish the job.
2,Not very durable.,"Product shipped quickly and arrived as expected. I used this on sanke keg walls, after just a few uses the bit wore down and was not able to penetrate any longer. I ended up buying a different brand from my local hardware store in a hurry. Once the bit wore out, it also had the effect of hardened the metal I was trying to drill."
3,You Need A Drill Press,"This bit is pretty sturdily constructed, but even with a beast of a 4.5A drill, it will kick like a MULE if the slightest thing goes wrong. I bought this thing to put tube socket holes in .052"" aluminum, and had the chassis go flying a couple of times. The cut is never clean, it spits out shards and will make protesting noises the whole time. I don't own a Unibit in this size, but I wish I did - they're of superior construction, and make drilling holes a breeze."
2,Dont use for drilling a Keggle,"Do not use this bit for any really hard metal like SS. My Keg was 1/8"" thick and this did not even get through the first 3 steps and it was shot. I was using cutting oil and had a large delta drill press. I'm sure it's fine for easy applications but if you are looking to drill through some serious metal look elsewhere."
3,"Good album, but it takes a few listens","Overall a good album, but don't expect to fall in love with it the first time you listen to it. Give it a few listens over some time and you're likely to find yourself wanting to hear it. I agree with the previous reviewer that it begins weak and gets stronger...."
3,Definitely not for beginners,"I gave Spanier only three stars not because I think it is a bad book: as the previous two reviewers have pointed out, Spanier is a comprehensive (and still good) account of the subject, but is by no means for beginners. Now that more user-frinedly ones like Bredon, Fomenko-Novikov, and Hatcher (forthcoming) are available, it would hardly justify giving it four or five stars. And for reference purposes, there is a small (and sometimes too terse) but attractive account by May that covers topics not touched by Spanier."
2,It was the 6th not the 9th edition,"I received a book from 1961, the 6th edition. The order was for 9th edition"
5,beautiful romance,"A magical story that captures what it's like, when you do work that you love, and yet still feel there's something missing in your life. Matt Baker is about to become a plastic surgeon, but when he spots pilot Carrie Porter, he feels the void in himself. Stuck in her remote Alaskan village, caring for a child who could be paralyzed, he begins to open up to the possibility of creating his own future. There's real suspense in the emotional conflict between these two very human and likeable (and sexy!) characters. And a wonderful sense of what it's like to live in such a remote, beautiful but sometimes forbidding place.I gobbled this story up in one sitting! Look forward to more of her work."
1,Not Satisfied.,"I bought this whole book for one song (Daphne Descends) I wanted to learn the rhythm guitar part which Billy plays but James' part is only transcribed and transcribed without using an EBow (which he only uses in the whole song). Usually you buy a tab book and you have all guitar parts and in the right order. Well some songs may be right, but most songs have only one guitar part. Not happy with my purchase, I paid $20 dollars to learn one song and it's not even transcribed or correct.I didn't even want to give this product one star but I guess I had to, to submit my review."
4,Spare Battery ALWAYS a good idea,"I decided with the purchase of my Nikon Coolpix S51, that having the extra battery was a great idea. I have always carried spare AA with my old camera but since this camera uses a special battery, I needed one and I have certainly not be sorry. The battery life is pretty long but you never want to be without on vacation and miss that perfect shot!"
4,Good replacement battery,"I have tried generic-brand batteries, and they just don't perform. I have had them arrive DOA, and had them wear out REALLY fast. The original Nikon battery is 5-10X as expensive, but at least you can count on it."
2,????????????????????????????,"Spoke with vendor about who the manufacturer and name appeared on battery, he said Nikon but no packaging or documentation, I have found the battery does not hold a charge. I was probably, I'm guessing, the 2nd owner and the battery had been returned by a previous customer. I have an original Nikon battery in my camera which still holds a charge for a longer time than the one I'd received, so I'm guessing the price was low because the battery was inadequate."
2,Lost package of a not so great battery,"It could just be me but for whatever reasons this battery sure is taking more time to charge than my previous one which used to typically get charged in 2 hrs whereas this one is taking about 4.5 hrs. Need to use it for few more times to identify the battery life.And the original package for this battery was lost - all the effort to get a replacement, which finally I got, seems to be in vain if the performance is not upto the mark!!"
4,Backup batteries are good,"I wish I didn't have to remove the battery to charge it, but otherwise it works fine. I bought this to have a backup when my primary ran out of juice."
3,Nice ideas....missing something(s),"I bought the book to get some inspiration for excercises I could use.It does cover te DMAIC series and shines light from different directions. Which is good as it covers many areas involved in improvement projects. I feel that the begin of the book is stronger then the end of the book.There is one area I miss in the Analyse area. It doesn't touch base at all on the use of ishikawa diagrams, fmea etc. It focusses more on the data in this area. Data is important, however the underlying cause can be a bit further away.The further I get in the book the more I miss.Happy reading!Marcel Ekkel"
4,Decent Games,"Since this is perhaps the only handbook available on activities for trainers trying to impart six sigma (DMAIC) concepts in a classroom environment, it should get it's due. Although the games are simple but the authors leave a lot for the trainer's interpretation and understanding of the activity. That would have been a good thing for a non-technical training like ITIL, PMP etc. But for technical training interpretation, trainer's guide etc. need to be very specific. The book covers activities on all aspects including ice-breakers, team formation, each of DMAIC phases etc. A seasoned trainer would be able to make good use of the book. Given that six sigma concepts are theoretical in nature the activities/games in the book do a good job of breaking away from the bookish rigor.More compact and direct activities with specific six sigma tools' usage would have fetched this book much higher rating. But nevertheless it's a good oasis amidst the six sigma training desert."
2,Do not buy this book,A bunch of junk. Not any of the really meaty excersises. An excuse for the auhor to make money.
2,Maybe Two Sigma,I was disappointed in this book. It flies way below the level of serious Six Sigma training. I would definitely not recommend using this book for other than the most basic venture into the world of Six Sigma - awareness not application. Using it with budding Six Sigma practitioners would be a major mistake.
2,Average,Not very practical and very difficult to be able to implement. Could have been alot simpler - will keep looking
5,the satan bug,outstanding flick! why in the world is this not available on DVD? just do not understand.
3,Good solid thriller>>>,I'm a fan of 60's t.v [Mission Impossible]. I enjoyed the movie and it was good seeing Maharis [who seemed to have fallen off the map].
2,satan bug,"d 14 years old this movie was very good for me,but when I saw it again,not the same like before..."
5,Indelible Doomsday Thriller,"THE SATAN BUG is one of my favorite modern day psychological manhunt dramas. It is well made biological doomsday thriller directed by John Sturges. I always amazed by George Maharis and his stoic, deadpan style of acting which he is well suited for here as the hero and main character of the film. SATAN BUG is a solid, engrossing and suspenseful film. This is good film-making all around right down to the performances, the script, cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. This film is truly haunting in nature. The black and white images, the darkness and shadows are indelible."
3,"Fun, if trivial","This wasn't quite as good as I remembered it from nearly half a century ago, but is still good fun. It is hard to see where a mad scientist is going to get goons to help him possibly wipe out the human race (more accurately, all life on Earth), with mad scientist and goons included, but this does make for an exciting story. The underground germ warfare facility is nowhere near as impressive as the similar installation later used in The Andromeda Strain, and the villains gain entry in a way at least a couple millenia old. George Maharis as the hero has, let's say, some thespian limitations, and I wouldn't have minded seeing more of Anne Francis, but Richard Basehart does a predictably excellent job. One of the villain's goons is Ed Asner (Lou Grant).This is based on a book by Alistair MacLean (Ice Station Zebra) using a pen name, with James Clavell (Shogun) co-writing the screenplay."
1,Wonderful Film - AWFUL DVD,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. The transfer is nothing less than APPALLING. It is a DISGRACE that such an awful transfer made it to market.
3,"Great movie, looks like a TV print however","I always loved this movie, but it's indifferently transfered to DVD. It's fuzzy and the colors look faded. Most of the other titles of this brand seemed ok, but they kind of struck out with this one."
2,Blotchy color despite proper application,"I've now grouted five different major tile projects, and am not impressed with the performance of polyblend grout. In both natural gray and sandstone, the color was very uneven in the finished project. It looked fine until the grout was thoroughly dry, but then some spots still looked dark (like they were still wet), and other spots were lighter. The problem has persisted for 10 years in one bathroom and four weeks (so far) in another. It's not my technique, because I didn't have the same problem with the Laticrete brand."
5,Very Good,This book is very informative. It has detailed information on not only the U.S. space program but also on the Soviet program as well. One of the best books I ever read on the subject.
5,Great CD Organizer,"Very compact, flexible organizer. No annoying slots, just slide your CD jewel case, single or double, into the friction holder. Can be stacked or placed side by side."
5,ecxxelent backpack,"if you really care abbout your camera,then you need to have this Kata r-103 rucksack.this is a total protection for my camera my lenses.etc. I am really happy with my purchase"
3,Great bag but difficult in the field,"I've tried to like this bag for a long time. It's well made but use it now for my secondary equipment which stays in the vehicle. It's more like a small daypack bag than one to take all you need into the field. I switched to the Lowepro Photo Trekker AW II Camera Backpack. I do not find the Lowepro too heavy as I do not pack it full of equipment, however, the ergonomics is so much better. The Lowpro provides better organization and easier access to what I need."
5,Great Photo Backpack I've ever seen in the market.,It's the great photo backpack for you to consider. It's has a lot of space and a lot of accessories to attach with. Just only one color that make me no choice to be different from my friend who use this same backpack.
4,Nice bag,"I love this bag! My gears are very secure in the padded compartments, and my laptop is not squished despite filling up the bag. I especially love the fact that when I put on the bag there is a slight gap so my back does not get sweaty.I just don't like the pockets which cannot hold many things. And I don't like that the raincover is not attached to the backpack, unlike in my Lowerpro Mini Trekker. But other than that I'm quite satisfied with this backpack.Definitely worth recommending to my friends. And I plan to get the R-101 to use as my daily backpack."
4,"Great bag functional, comfortable, practical.","This is a great bag, I have a Canon 20D with battery grip, 70-200mm F/2.8, 12-24mm f/4, 28-105mm, 35mm, 50mm, card reader, macbook pro 15"", bag of 24 AA batteries, canon 430ex flash, 250gb external drive, note pads, extension tubes, pens, and the power cord for the laptop in the bag. Other than being heavy, the bag fits comfortably, and rides on my scooter with me. Other than needing an extra divider or two, this is a great bag. Comes with nice camera strap, tripod carry strap, and several little pull tight bags that can stick to the inside with Velcro."
2,Disappointed,"Highly recommend The Guffalo and Room on a Broom as stronger picks from this author. Snail on a Tail comes in second place. Low recommendation for The Gaffulo's Child. My child (4 yr old) found Charlies Cook's Favorite Book hard to follow, as did I. I ordered it because of our success with the above mentioned books. We read this one once and it has remained on the shelf since."
3,"Not Her Best, But OK","This book is not her best work. Gruffalo and Room on the Broom are great, this one is just ok."
4,terrific !,"my 3 yr son loves this book, even a year later! it is somehow engaging and fun even though it is relatively short. You need to add this to your book collection. buying stick man now. hope it is an engaging."
2,It's ok,This book wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be. It's a bunch of little books inside of one. Kind of weird but ok. My main problem was the page about a ghost and the ghost taking off and holding her head. Not something I want to be reading to my kid who had to sleep alone at night! I skip that page when I read to him!
2,Charlie Cook's Favorite Book,I think Charlie Cook's Favorite Book would be more appropriate for and older child who might have been exposed to the books discussed. I was purchasing this for a five year old.
4,Good quality watch for everyday wear.,"This is an attractive watch but I am not crazy about the way the hinge on the inside of the band leaves a mark on my wrist. Also, the diamonds are extremely small and do not contribute much to the design. (I purchased mine for half the price at an auction site.)Update: Two years later, it still runs and still looks nice. Overall I would say it has proven itself to be very durable and I would qualify it a good watch."
4,Serves as a sampler of Monday Michiru circa 1994-1996,"At first I thought this was just an attempt to recycle older tracks to cash in on Monday Michiru's increased popularity in recent years. While that may be a factor, after hearing the album several times I'm beginning to appreciate the smooth, consistent flow that this choice of 1994-1996 tracks generates when connected together via this non-stop mix by Kaoru Inoue. The tracks themselves show little or no remixing, though...so basically you are getting the album versions of tracks from MAIDEN VOYAGE, JAZZ BRAT, one from DELICIOUS POISON, several remixes or non-lp cuts, and one track Monday did with United Future Organization. Overall, the music shows what happens when the potential for the so-called ""acid jazz"" genre is reached via strong songs, excellent vocals, and creative arrangements. I'd recommend the original albums first, but this is a nice sampler if you want an introduction to Monday's first few years of musical creativity."
5,Works as expected,Not much to say about this serial cable. I use it everyday for work and it has never let me down.
3,One Trick Pony,"The Automatic's not accepted anywhere is a pretty average effort. Monster is a great, catchy tune. The rest of the album is not much to write home about. Save yourself the expense and download Monster - ignore the rest."
5,wonderfull,i love this book! keep up with the good work and bring us some more. great present for your children.
5,The Annotated Brothers Grimm,"A beautifully bound volume of the Grimm collection. With its side notes and explanations of what is going on in each tale, what better way to teach children the origin of these stories and gain a greater appreciation of its creation.This book is just that book to have on your library shelf. I am delighted to have it. (And I am well over 13 years of age.)"
5,Great,I gave this as a gift for my little brother he absolutely loves it. We read it and he gets introduced to the lesser known culture of the true brothers Grimm stories. The annotations also help him understand the works better than I could have helped him.
5,Great Edition!,"I bought this as a gift and was very impressed when I received it. The information provided in the annotations are wonderful and very relevent. They are provided in the margins which prevents a lot of page flipping or distractions from looking at the bottom of the page. The drawings and pictures are wonderful as well. I did think that the print ran a little too close to the spine though. The hard cover looks very nice underneath the dust jacket. I was very tempted to keep this edition for myself, as it is better than my own, but my dad loved it!"
2,Far Out,"Mot people think I am far out, but this book is even too far out for me. I had my first regression in 1989 and have been regressing other people since 1997. I haven't seen it all, but I've seen a lot... and nothing like this. I'm open minded and curious, but I couldn't finish this book. I thought it jumped to a lot of conclusions with the thinnest of facts to back it up and was just too fantastic for my mind to comprehend. If you are curious about past life regression or progression, just do it. The truth will connect with you on an emotional level."
3,poem,"Fop Flop In the most elegant apparel Nothing but worm silks In the finest golden thread And superior king red velvet sashesYou'd think I would have known better? I couldn't blame them who wouldn't? cut air with scissors while sewing their needles into invisible cloth for the very low price of..... silk a loom golden thread a full bag of coins Oh those Villain Scoundrels! Now, I know not to buy such vestments with rather large investments Oh what a bratty gnatty I was For I thought I was cool but truly a fool Why emperor you look rather bare, that's quite rare! I was in such a pursuit For only a birthday suit I must admit now Me, My very own self yes indeed, your emperor himself have become a stupid and incompetent dandy All for the Imaginary Image! and now I live happily ever after, no more garb well, that is until the next apparel discovery (Now if you'll excuse me there's a clothier waiting at my door who says he's created the latest design in Pajama attire)"
4,Great Triple Feature,"All three movies are great. You can preview them when they come on Lifetime, but I wanted to add them to my home library. The movies are as good as the Harlequin books. Very romantic and fun. They are often fairly predictable, but still very enjoyable. Here's what the back says. May help you decide if you want to make the purchase:""The Awakening""A levelheaded young woman is thrown off balance when she teams up with a bounty hunter to track an antiques smuggler. Her adventure leads her to discover a passion within her.""Broken Lullaby""Attempting to solve a family mystery, Jordan meets Nick, who is searching for the same music box that is her only clue. But someone else is searching for the priceless antique.""Loving Evangeline""A powerful executive returns to his seaside hometown following his brother's fatal boating accident. He finds himself becoming obsessed with the truth about his brother's death as well as the attractive marina owner."
3,behind the times,"I once saw all of these movies and found them romantic at that time but basically they are old and now outdated and somewhat cheesy as far as how the romance part of the movies in particular are filmed. In order of best to least I would put The Awakening 1st but close with Broken Lullaby, and Loving Evangeline last. I would pass these over easily for some that don't even have sex (no nudity shown in these except back,shoulders,and legs) in them."
3,One out of three ain't bad...,"I saw Loving Evangeline on WTN, and wanted a copy for myself. When I found out that the price of that movie alone was the same as the triple feature, I figure I had nothing to lose. I'm glad I didn't pay extra for The Awakening (I found it offensive, actually), and Broken Lullaby (boring). Luckily, Loving Evangleine was just a good as I remembered. It has an excellent mystery (the identity of the bad guy came as quite a surprise), and Nick Mancuso made me cry not once, but twice, talking about his murdered younger brother. It is a movie I'll be watching again often."
3,"Yeah, but...","There's no doubt that Paul Kearney has the ability to spin a powerful yarn. The politics, the drama, the plot twists, the characters, they're all there. But I base my rating of a story's quality on its ability to hold my attention. And nothing diverts my attention more than flagrant spelling errors which should have been caught in the proofreading stage. These appear throughout the novel. Rather than galley proof reviews, ""The Second Empire"" was apparently given a quick run through a spellchecker, without regard for the results. When I read ""I am tyred, Betanza thought. I am tyred, and I am older than I think I am."", I imagined Betanza as a golf cart rather than leader of the Inceptine Order. If the author is tired of the story, he should just finish it and spin us another fascinating tale. Ace Books should be more careful."
3,Dream Away,"I bought this for 2 reasons. First, I always loved Frank Sinatra's version of Dream Away from his Ol' Blue Eyes is back. I recently discovered that it was based on but not in The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing soundtrack. Second, I think John Williams is one of the best soundtrack composers. Unfortunately there is no single track that contains anything close to the wonderful arrangement on the Sinatra recording. Nonetheless it is still an above average soundtrack. It also contains the rejected Michel Legrand version which was nothing special. My favorite tracks are 3,5,6,9,10,16"
4,Plenty of room,"I bought this because I was moving from Boston, MA to Phoenix, AZ and driving myself and my 2 daughters. I was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity- and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut.It rained and snowed on our trip and luckily, we had everything already wrapped up in plastic bags - this is not a waterproof cargo bag, but rather, water *resistant*.When we got to Phoenix, I noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed. I think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship.I recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip, but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving.Good points: Was able to fill it really well, was very easy to installNot so good: straps really can't be secured down and end up flapping in the wind"
4,"Good cargo bag - roomy, but not huge.","Bought this cargo bag for Burning Man. The picture (I think) is a little decieving. It didnt hold as much as I hoped, but did hold 2 large tents, a camping tarp and 2 small duffle bags. The straps fit securely around my Jeep Grand Cherokee stock roof rack. I would recommend this product - especially for the price - but take the lack of storage space into consideration if you're expecting to stuff a ton of property into it!"
3,rooftop cargo carrier - soft,"for the price, it was good, it did what it needed but just flipping it over on the sidewalk put 3 holes in it. I guess I thought it would be tougher than that. It is also just weather resistant, not waterproof. It worked well and was spacious enough for what i needed so it was still money well spent."
1,car top cargo bag,"So we used this exactly as instructed, and only filled it 3/4 of its capability. The straps came loose, the material ripped in several spots, and the inside shed material all over our stuff. I am very disappointed with this product. It wasn't even worth the 25$. We had to tape the straps and rips halfway home to ensure it made it. Ridiculous!"
4,"good pruduct, great price","I bought this one for my family vacation from PA to outer bank, NC. It works great."
2,Are you kidding me? The straps aren't waterproof?,"I have a 2008 Prius without any sort of roof rack. I purchased the 15 cu. ft. Roof Bag and installed it with no real issues. Then it started to rain--the straps soak up the water and transport it to the interior of the car, where it drips all over the seats. This is completely unacceptable! To add insult to injury, I can't get in touch with their customer service department. The recording either states their business hours (which I called well within) or that all their representatives are busy, then asks you to leave a message, and that's it."
3,Used to go from Sand Francisco to Miami and back.,"I wanted something cheap, that would work for a really long round trip. Well, this ""worked"" but was falling apart by the time we got back. The straps stayed strong with no problems. The shell was not very good. The waterproofing worked a little bit, but I still wrapped the luggage in plastic bags (good thing I did on the way back). The canvas began to fall apart and the waterproofing just flaked off the inside. It is cheap, which was the appeal, but not for long term use."
5,Great poroduct,THis item was shipped and was received better than expected. I'm very happy with it. inexpensive and helped very much on my last trip.
3,Know your needs,"This cargo carrier must be used with a four rail luggage rack on your car. My car only has 2 side rails so the carrier slide backwords the whole trip. It is very difficult to get things in and out while you are travelling, if you need to access items daily on a journey its a struggle.Some water does get in. There is no lock so it can be cut easily and broken into. A hard top carrier with a lock is much safer."
3,Died 14 Months After Purchase,"CO2 Review----------------------This is one of those items you assume works because it doesn't go off and sounds when tested.The unit was still on the original batteries which, after testing, showed were still well charged but switched the out just in case. No change, still getting the dreaded 30 second beep after initial power-up which the label clearly states ""After seven years from initial power up, this unit will 'chirp' every 30 seconds to indicate that it is time to replace the alarm. REPLACE IMMEDIATELY! IT WILL NOT DETECT CO IN THIS CONDITION!""If this trend keeps up we will buying a unit every 15 months which is no where near the SEVEN years indicated on the label.Kidde we would happily pay a few dollars extra for a unit from a country of origin where quality still reigns.Smoke Alarm Review----------------------This unit is still passing it's tests and has been 'used' a few times due to young, aspiring chefs going for well done :)"
3,No Tabletop Stand,"I ordered two of these combo CO / Smoke Detector sets, the CO detectors are supposed to come with a tabletop stand which would eliminate unnecessarily drilling holes into walls, neither of the two sets I ordered included the stand, what are these, reject sets ???"
5,Best Algebra 1 Textbook,This book is the best Algebra 1 textbook I have ever seen. It explains all the problems easily in a way a student can understand it very well. I recommend this book to anyone who is is planning to take Algebra 1.
3,Ok for some but too busy looking for me.,"I selected this item for a boy or girl and thought I would just add accent colors when the baby came. It arrived quickly but I didn't like it. The crib skirt reminded me of the 80's and their was just too many patterns going on. I would have used the comforter and bumper pad, but didn't like the crib skirt and sheet and it is priced to high for me not to like all four pieces. I also felt the quality was cheap compared to what I paid for it. If you aren't sure if you are going to like it based on the picture, you probably won't like it when it arrives at your house."
2,Unable to support its claimed weight capacity,"I bought these mounts because they are rated for speakers up to 25 lbs (I have Infinity Beta 20 speakers that weigh 20 lbs).Unfortunately, the vertical tilt isn't a locking mechanism -- it relies on friction from tightening down a screw. With my Beta 20's, you can't apply enough pressure to keep the speakers pointed out. They immediately sag until the bottom of the speaker is touching the wall."
3,Does the job,"The mounts fit the bill. Its a bit of a challenge to then set up and to line them up so that the speakers are good and straight. To some extent, this is probably part of the price you pay for getting a unit that has a lot of flexibility. All in all, it does the job, which is all that I had hoped for."
4,Nice Speaker Mounts,I was looking for some sturdy mounts for some older wharfdale bookshelf speakers - these did the trick. Some of the screws included were cheaply made - the heads stripped out easily - but the wall mount itself seems sturdy. Would buy again overall.
5,This is owesome,This skate tool is very handy when u r out there skateng to this is a good purhase so get it
3,"Simple, portable skate tool.","Great tool for the price. Fits in pockets of shorts comfortably, and fits my vinyl cruiser skateboard as well as full size boards, and even longboards. Only problem with the tool, as other people noted, is the screwdriver mount doesn't always stay in the top of the tool.definitely recommend this to future buyers."
5,Its a skate tool,It is what it is. Also comes with Flathead and Phillips screw driver inside the tool. Changed my longboard hardware with this tool.
1,Broken on arrival,"Upon opening the package, i thought that i had gotten a good producthowever, the 8mm hex screw would not turn!further inspection showed that it had been snapped clean off, BEFORE i took it out of the package!!Anything endorsed by amazon should have better quality control"
5,It works,"Nice, handy, tool to have with you when you are making sure your ride is correct. It is a nice toolbox for your board that fits in your sweater's pocket."
3,"Good, but screwdriver is weak.","I really like this tool, but don't count on being about to use the screw driver function (built into the handle) for much torque."
5,Its Great,A Few Days Ago I Got It It Was Great Didnt Have Nothing Wrong With It And I Am Very Happy I Got It I Hope Other Peaple Agree And Get It Thank You
1,Horrible,I ignored the first message. Noone can understand our message when they call no mater what we do. I didn't believe an organization could really not know how to make the basic functions work but I was wrong. Our's still hasn't stoped flashing. I am returning it.
2,Rather a disappointment...,"...what a shame. The Goblins have lost their edge with this one. I'm a HUGE fan of their previous efforts, but this one just lost me. They've done away with their slower, more doomy/spacey stuff and replaced it with faster-paced ""punk-metal"", for lack of a better term. The lyrics have lost any originality and they sound more like Metallica now than anyone else.With this album, they've given up their crown..."
2,"Another wannabe ""tango nuevo"" album","The product description says it all: ""[the album will] appeal to a sophisticated lifestyle-oriented consumer"". But will it appeal to a tango lover? Hmmm.Unfortunately the better tracks here are the least adventurous, which should tell you something. ""Libertango"" is completely in the style of the Gotan Project's first album (which is no bad thing). But from here on its mostly downhill. ""Vuelvo al sur"" is given a very simple repetitive drum-bass treatment with no variation of beat.What drew me to this album was seeing that track 3, ""Homage to Chet Baker"", was based on the wonderful tune ""Alone Together"". Unfortunately it's just a mess - the wonderful melody has no chance. Listen to Jo Stafford to hear this tune done properly.Track 5, ""The Gaucho's Pain"" is indeed that, a painful reworking of Piazzolla's ""Oblivion""In summary: a commercial attempt to cash in on the tango nuevo mini-boom, with little of originality - sorry"
4,lovely illustrations,"Let me say right away that this book is rather abbreviated. If you really are intently interested in oceanography, try Garrison's full text. But this Essentials text will convey enough of the field to let you decide if oceanography is a pursuit for you.The treatment is roughly at a freshman level in university, or perhaps for an advanced high school course. Some prior knowledge of chemisty and physics is assumed, in order for there to be any intelligent discussion of many aspects of oceanography.The text also is well illustrated. The subject is one that readily lends itself to many photogenic shots. While this may sound frivolous to some, to others it has always been one of the attractions of oceanography. There are indeed some lovely photos scattered through the book."
3,book for class,"The book is good. Can't say much about, its only a book for a class I'm taking. I'm glad that I got it a lot cheaper then what the school was offering. I would have rated it higher if it was a book i actually wanted, I mean who can be excited over a book for class, not me. But I'm sure it will do its job once it comes time to use it. =)"
3,Worth watching despite trouble committing to one theme or another,"'Facing Windows' had a lot of promise and, in general, is a pleasant enough viewing. But the early reviewer who I think has it spot-on is the one who says ""Turkish-born director Ferzan Ozpetek...often loses his way."" Exactly. That encapsulates the issue. Some here have praised this film's ""multiple levels,"" but I think instead it's a lack of focus - it is, by turn, a portrait of a marriage, a detective story, and a story of new love. I don't see a dexterous intermingling of these threads; instead, it appears Ozpetek has trouble committing to one theme or another.That said, I do recommend seeing the film. The beautiful Giovanna Mezzogiorno is a talented actress. And the core tale involving mystery man 'Simone' - of his heroic actions towards the end of WWII and his love that dare not speak its name - is the film's most intriguing and well executed thread."
3,"Dream, Dream, Dream","A haunting film on memory, love and loss. Giovanna Mezzogiorno humanizes this film. Massimo Girotti offers a mesmerizing final performance. Don't dismiss your dreams ~ Demand them!"
2,Um what?,"I really wanted to like this film but honestly it was just boring. There was nothing too exciting about it, the elderly man's character is the only one that is interesting. The women is bland, the film doesn't give you a reason to care about her. The end of the film my thought was um what?"
2,I would personally not advise this book.,"If, by any chance, you can tolerate wrong grammer, spelling and mislabeling of constellations, then this is the book for you. If not, look somewhere else."
2,"Great Pictures, Horrible Text","This book is torturous to read! It was originally written in Italian, but the book's publisher seems to have hired the worst Italian-English translators available, so the English is horrible. Also, many diagrams (and even some sections of text) are still in Italian (for example, see pages 31 and 40)! There are even some factual errors. On the other hand, it has some amazing pictures and a great layout, but that's pretty much all that's good about it. It would probably be really good in its original Italian version, so it's too bad I don't know Italian. Basically, this is a great image book to flip through, but don''t read a word of it!"
1,"Nice photos and graphics, but poor translation and lots of typos","I would like to confirm the other critical reviews here, regarding the following two points:- while the book is well-structured, and the photos and graphics are nice,- the translation is one of the worst I have ever seen. In some parts, the grammar is wrong to a level that makes it hard to understand sentences, or even paragraphs. In some instances, there are also original Italian words in the text which must have slipped through untranslated.Furthermore, there are lots of typos, and when it comes to numbers, this can make quite a difference. For example, on p. 226 some temperatures are given as 102 to the power of 7 K, and 101 to the power of 5 K (written with a superscript 7 and 5, respectively), where they actually should be 10 to the 27 K, and 10 to the 15 K, respectively -- quite a bit of a difference...All of this together does not build up a lot of confidence in the accuracy of the text."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I too was deceived by this book. The photos are of excellent quality and quite beautiful but the book is completely useless if you want to learn anything about astronomy. As others have stated, it is difficult to read due to the italian translation but more importantly, there are factual errors in this book. So if you are in it for the pictures, go for it. But if you are looking for correct and valid information, move on."
2,One of the worst translation jobs ever to see print,"This book was originally written in Italian, and ""translated"" into English by someone who had a tenuous grasp of the language at best. ""The Atlas Of The Skies"" is full of misprints, nonsensical phrasing, weird punctuation errors, and outright mistakes of every kind imaginable (and some that I could never have imagined, until I came across them).Several photo captions are still in their original Italian - I don't know if they were missed, or if the ""translator"" threw up his hands in despair, and gave up.""The Atlas of the Skies"" rates two stars, and those are only for the beautiful photos and excellent (though poorly annotated) diagrams it contains.I bought this book for my son, who was two at the time. I was thinking when he learned to read, the book would be there for him, and until then we would look at the pictures together. Guess we can still do the latter!"
2,Seriously in need of editing,"A beautiful looking book, well illustrated and seemingly informative, until you start reading it! It has obviously been written by an Italian with an imperfect knowledge of English grammar and syntax, and it makes for very heavy reading. Sentences are long and difficult to follow. Other sentences have no verb. Some captions are wrong, and others are labelled in Italian. Star names are also in Italian, which is not helpful.Why was this book not edited for the English-speaking world? I give it two stars for its appearance, but zero if I could, for the lack of editing."
1,In flames rip-offs,"the first track was the longest song i had ever heard. then i looked up to see that i was halfway through the album. every song is the same thing. way to repitituous. not to mention how they have managed to copy in flames to the exact riff. I hear no originality in this album. and dont even think about buying Embodiment. Its basically them same thing. if you want to hear these guys though, then just buy ""the jester race"" and ""whorical"" by in flames. save your money and listen to a band has some originality."
4,a great history lesson,"This is a simple and delightful children's picture book that introduces today's children to an American legend. The book tells of childhood in Indian Territory, where he learned ""to ride and rope as well as any boy or man"" . It also tells of his love of books. This provides younger readers with lots of great information on a hero of long ago that they may have never even heard of. All in all it's a great little history lesson.This is a lovely story that will excite children's imagination, and the beautiful illustrations will charm young and old alike.We recommend this book for kids ages 4-8 who have an interest in cowboys."
1,Keating's Attempt,"Former Governor Frank Keating's book is obviously just an attempt to link his own name with that of Will Rogers. The book was poorly written, inaccurate, insensitive, and unnecessary. Innumberable books about Will are out there already - written with much more skill and knowledge. For adults, I would recommend Ben Yagoda's ""Will Rogers: A Biography"" (University of Oklahoma Press, 1993), and younger readers would enjoy Liz Sonneborn's ""Will Rogers: Cherokee Entertainer"" (Chelsea House Publishers, 1993). The irony of a politician trying to capitalize on Will's image even now is pretty funny."
3,Camera Battery,Not really sure how good this battery is because there may be a problem with the camera itself in terms of holding a charge. It charged rather quickly but discharged rather fast as well.
2,"When it worked, it worked great!","We've had this battery for a few months and it worked almost as well as the canon battery. But now it just won't charge. Seeing as how we keep it in the camera bag when it is not in use as an alternate, it's not been subjected to any kind of hard treatment or moisture. It just gave up."
4,Inspiring and beautiful,The inspiring true story of a Jewish couple who fell in love as teenagers during the 1940s and were separated by the Holocaust.
3,"Ambitious, but . . .","Carl Sandburg is best remembered for his poetry and his multi-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln. In addition, he also wrote an excellent memoir about his childhood years and this 1,000 page novel (among other things). The theme of the book is America, mainly the Pilgrims, the Revolutionary War, and the Civil War. It's a sprawling book as it deals with each period, so sprawling that the characters, and there are many of them, never really come to life. Sandburg writes well, and much of the novel takes on a poetic feel. But the novel seems more about the American Dream than the flesh-and-blood people who actually dream (and live) it."
5,Simply a great novel.,If you like historical fiction you will love this novel. Carl Sandburg's saga of America covers four major eras of our history: the Puritan's founding of the Plymouth colony;the Revolutionary War; the Civil War; and World War Two. Sandburg makes the characters come alive as they struggle with individual life circumstances and major issues of their respective historical periods. As a reader you will be saddened by their failures and revel in their accomplishments. This is one of the best novels I have ever read.
5,Sandburg's Forgotten Classic,"Carl Sandburg's sweeping epic tracing a family line from Plymouth Rock to WWII, touching on significant events of American history along the way."
5,A show everyone can enjoy,This is one of my favorite shows and is very funny. I gave a rating of 5 stars for its quality but a rating of 0 stars to the studio for changing the theme song. I know it will not take away from the quality of the show but the song they were using fit so well. I wonder what they will use as its replacement. Lets just hope that the episodes are uncut at least.
3,NOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY DID NOT!,"How can they be so stupid?! changing the theme song as it leads to the name of the show: WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU! god the new one's so painful so I have to skip the generic which I like! Anyway fun little comedy with some really funny situations and others a little to easy.Can't wait for season 2,my favorite one."
2,not the worst show...,"Here's the problem with this show- it starts out good in the first season as it explores the relationship between an odd couple of two sisters, and then quickly declines as it solely focuses on the love triangle between Holly (Amanda Bynes) and two young men. This cliche ends up ruining the cute and fun aspect of the show. I happen to think amanda bynes is talented and plays these quirky characters quite well (especially in What a Girl Wants and She's the Man). But seeing Jennie Garth play a character with awful comedic timing and who barely gets to deliver a comedic line is difficult to watch at times. Especially because of how great she was on Beverly Hills, 90210. I also think the show finds difficulty finding its own voice and struggles between being a comedy and being a cliched corny drama. I'm actually surprised it lasted for 4 seasons and would attribute that solely to the talent of Amanda Bynes, who carries the entire show."

2,MISSING PAGES,"Very disappointed.I'm enjoying Miller Williams's poems, but pages 19 to 50 are missing! And yet the book is bound securely in paperback form. Let this be a warning to anyone else intending to send for a copy. I'm not sending it back for a replacement because that might also be faulty. Besides, unless it came by fast freight, it would be too late, as I am going to be away after August 20th.And this IS an Amazon Verified Purchase!- Murray Jennings"
4,enlightening and interesting,"As a genetic female who had friends who are transgender, this book has helped me to understand what my friends went through in their journeys to their identity. I have also seen various women's communities (lesbian and feminist spirituality groups) struggle with this issue and grow toward greater acceptance: I believe change is coming. The reason I gave the new edition only 4 stars is that I felt disappointed that the appendix consisted more of a rehashing of a past conflict with an intolerant individual. I know the author had a need to get this off her chest and explain,but I wish she had also brought us up to date on changes in her life since the events of the original book.Although not transgender myself, as a lesbian, a computer ""geek"" and a Goddess worshipper I related in many ways to Geri's story and am glad it is now again back in circulation."
3,Fair for $25 a pair,"Nice size (they were about 10mm each), nice luster, but have some blemishes. One has 4 blemishes, and the other one has 5. I bought them for daily use, so I can deal with it. They were $25 anyway."
2,no title,"I don't think I like Sherwood Anderson at all, with the exception of ""Poor White"". Another depressing bunch of stories, except for the title story, which was actually very funny in the beginning. All was internal thought, with no real action and, worse, no real resolving of problems. The endings just seemed to dwindle off into nowhere. How this man ever came to be thought of as a great writer is beyond me. And it is puzzling why almost all his characters who have internal dilemmas are women. He is always trying to get inside the mind of a woman and delve into how she perceives sex and men - while she is still a virgin. An obsession with him."
3,button batteries,ok batteries.seller sent these instead of the ones i ordered.he finallt told me he was out of the pnes o wanted.these work just fine
4,universal speaker mounts,"Worked out great for the price. You are limited on your rotation because you cant swivel 360 degrees. Its either up, down or left, right. Used these on an older set of Sony surround speakers and it looked good and they were secure."
3,great little radio but needs better reception.,"battery life is great. works and sounds like a charm if you get a reception. however, the tuner is weak. needs better reception for popular philadelphia radio stations like 94.1 fm, 950am, and 1060am.bottom line is that u get what you pay for."
2,better quality needed,"I found this product to be poor in quality, with extremely limited reception. The return policy with BuilderDepot will charge me a 15% handling fee plus the additional cost to ship it back. I will keep product but will not shop BuilderDepot again. You get what you pay for. Next time I will know better."
1,believe the bad comments!,"I didn't believe the reviews and I wanted to give this unexpensive radio a try... but the tuner was weak as they said and above all the volume was really temperamental, and now after not even a month of really moderate use it died... I wish I kept the box to return it, instead I am just tossing it in the garbage"
4,great coat,Great coat for the pricecomfy and adaptable to different stylegood deal overall.. recommended
5,Engrossing and lovable characters!!,"I really got into this book!! It was in my recommendations and I was a bit hesitant about buying it but I thought what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I am sooo glad I did, as it was one of those books I could not put down. It is engrossing and suspensful. I fell in love with Dr. Susan Shader and there is such depth in her relationship with her son that the authoor is very perceptive in portraying. As a parent I felt her pain and really could not believe how adept Mr. Glass was in making me feel a lot of things throughout the whole book. It is so much more than just a thriller although it does that well too. Very deep and moving and anyone who did not enjoy this book must be made of stone. It shows a real sensitivity that a lot of books lack and I can't wait to read his next novel, ""Blood""."
4,Grabs you from page one!,"This is the kind of book that grabs your attention on page one and doesn't let go until you've closed the book. In fact, you'll probably find yourself thinking about the book long after you've put it back on the shelf. Glass (the pseudonym of a New York Times bestselling author) effectively builds up the suspense and keeps the reader guessing. I really liked the main characters, and found them to be extremely interesting with a nice 'human' quality about them."
2,All over the place and boring snoreeeeeeeeee....,"Sorry Miss Shader, but this one was dull dull dull! It seemed the book was all over the place with alot of very boring detail that just didnt need to be there at all...then the last chapter was finally exciting. I had a hard time drudging through it. I was surprized to see others liked it so much. I found myself skipping or skimming pages to see if there was anything worth reading in it. Finally the last 20 pages there ws some action. Shesh! Next time try to spread that action out a bit ...I found that most the people/circumstances unbelievable and boring.Good luck next time."
2,Disappointed - in myself for reading it.,"For me, it WAS an ""Airplane Book"". Reading it on the plane on the way home from Florida, I was continually disappointed in myself for picking a book of such little substance. There are better books out there."
3,90% chance to recover your data from a dead LaCie,"This drive is easy to use, but has high failure rate. We use about 40 LaCie Firewire drives year round and have about 10% failure rate. We recovered 100% data from more than 90% of the ""dead"" drives. It doesn't make any sense if LaCie told you that they can't recover the data. Let us know if you need help to recover the data."
1,LaCie 500 Gig External Drive,"I had a 500 gig LaCie external harddrive fail on me after the one year warranty period expired and LaCie would not assist. I opened the box and found inside two 250 Maxtor drives. If I wanted Maxtor, I could have purchased them for a lot less. Where is the quality LaCie promises if they use Maxtor?"
2,Same problem . . .,"The drive performed admirably for 20 mos, then failed. LaCie suggested it might be the power cord and offered a replacement. That didn't work. However, I think I've discovered that if I plug in USB cable, then the firewire cable, then remove the USB cable, then plug it (the USB cable) back in, I'm able to access the drive. This seems vaguely repeatable, for now . . ."
2,Sad former owner,"Just over two years old, my La Cie 500GB external drive died today. Even after counting the drive contents as a total loss and reformatting the drive, copying data back to it soon failed and the drive reported the exact same errors. Terribly sad.I bought a Western Digital MyBook to replace it. Hopefully that will treat me better."
2,not working correctly,"The hard drive only works if connected through a USB cord. Neither the fire wire 400 nor the fire wire 800 works. Contact with LaCie resulted in a request that I send the drive to them for repair. I got no instructions on where to send it, even after I asked."
1,LaCie Hard Drives - Fails within 2 years,"In 2 years two out of my three LaCie drives have failed, the most recent being a Big Disk. It just stopped working and became inert one day. LaCie insisted that if i wanted to claim the warranty then I was not allowed to recover the data on the disk which LaCie insisted would be destroyed. If I tried to recover the data before providing them with the failed LaCie drive then the warranty would be void. LaCie confirmed they would absolutely not help me recover any data as part of their warranty. If you buy a LaCie product then make sure to also buy another hard disk from some other manufacturer so you can backup the LaCie given there is a relatively high probability the LaCie will fail"
1,"If you value your data, do not buy a LaCie.","I had the extreme displeasure of owning two of these paperweights and suffice it to say the negative reviews for these drives and this company are spot on.Both drives failed, exhibiting the same symptoms as most of the other users here on Amazon and if you research this company and drive you will find that the reviews across the web are lock step with what you will see here.Not going to get much more into it than that, just know that if you value your data do not buy anything from LaCie because they have made it abundantly clear that they don't value your data or your repeat business."
1,Lacie Drive Failure,"The Lacie Big Triple 500GB external drive was purchased three years ago to offer more storage and become my Media Drive, replacing smaller Maxtor drives (five years old). I used Backup software and TimeMachine to keep current backups of the iMac internal and Lacie Media Drive... Fortunately!!!The Lacie started clicking, and after some research, and no customer support offered by Lacie, I found out that there was a power supply issue with these Lacie's. I decided to keep using the drive till total failure. This happened about six months later. No files were lost because I ran backups continuously.I have ordered replacing Seagate and Maxtor drives. I will never purchase or recommend Lacie to any of my clients or for personal use.Shame on you Lacie not extending Customer Service and replacing the faulty power supplies on your drive assemblies."
1,Quality control issues,"Got this as a replacement for a defective 400GB of same model. Lasted about two years before suffering from same problems as noted by others. Either they can't figure out good suppliers for their power supplies or they accept too many failed drives. Anyways, I wouldn't waste your money with these."
1,LaCie 500 Gb,"Saw the other reviews, scared the **!! out of me so I returned it and got a Segate 300GB that was highly rated. No problems to date."
1,big disk sucks,I have 2 big disks. They have each been replaced twice in the past 8 months. They both just failed again. I am certainly not trusting anymore data with these unreliable things. Possibly they are failing because they get so hot.I own a couple of maxtors that have been up and running without hassles for 2 years.
1,Absolute garbage,"I have bought about TEN 500gb Lacie drives. Within two years, I have had all but 1 fail. Several failed within the one year warranty period and were replaced. The replacements failed a few months later.I gave them the benefit of the doubt and suggested that perhaps they got a bad batch of drives or components. They respond with the standard line about how many drives they sell and how my drives are out of the one year warranty. Essentially, customer service and tech support make no attempt to help. When I mentioned how many bad reviews (all of them) they receive on Amazon, their response is that only people with problems write reviews anyway. These are all canned lines taught to customer service.So, I figured I'd add my .02 and warn any one even thinking of buying a Lacie drive to stay away if you care at all about your data."
1,I wish I can give it zero star,"This is a very slick looking drive but it's a POS. Good thing I didn't have to spend a penny buying this drive because the company paid for it. About 2 years ago, 500GB drives did not exist so instead LaCie decided to use RAID 0 2 x 250GB to get the 500GB capacity. BAD idea! Great for performance but you have zero redunancy. The fact that it only takes 1 drive to fail to lose all your data is highly risky to put any important files in it. Buy an external drive with 1 drive only or one that offers RAID 1 or RAID 5. You will be at less risk of losing your data if one of the drive goes bad."
1,Poor customer support,"Mine crashed within one year but I did not complain until the 14th month. LaCie said no warranty after one year and the cost to repair, as I offered to pay for repair, was as great as buying a new product. Apparently, the life expectancy is one year. LaCie does not advertise this limitation as far as I know."
1,Not worth a Star,"If one really wants to understand how a ""scholar"" distorts, misinterprets and ignores the facts then this book is a must buy. The author has intentionally turned his back on the abundance of literature on Sikh history and old historic accounts and rather chose to write his baseless assertions without any facts. This book hardly gives any factual information about Sikhism. It is one thing to disagree with tradition but another to question it without presenting any credible evidence. Author's opinions cannot be considered historic facts when no solid evidence is presented. I would suggest saving time and money by staying away from this garbage of lies. This book has been refuted by many Sikh scholars in ""Invasion of Religious Boundaries"".[...]"
5,Marley and Lee R together? Heaven!!!,"If you love your smooth jazz and your Bob Marley, this is simply heaven!"
1,Marley Fan's Stay Away,"This is really no better than the muzak versions of Rolling Stones songs I heard in elevators as a kid. Sure the musicians are technically proficient - probably better than any of the Wailers, but there's a reason why you don't see Lee Ritenour Posters in every mall across America. Marley had soul - this stuff is lifeless. Then again, if this helps you unwind during you commute, by all means buy it. We can all use less road rage.I'll stick to the original myself. By the way - if you're into jazz AND Marley, check out Jaco's version of ""I shot the sheriff"". Much cooler (although not as smooth) than anything here."
3,Three and one half stars,"I heard the three best songs on the cd on the radio quite a while back and have intended to purchase the album. It has been quite a disappointemt to expect the flavor of Marley and hear the twisted renderings that exist on this record. The 'redemption songs' are Get Up Stand Up, Jammin' and a distant third 'Is This Love'(Ritenour did a better job on his album by that name). All in all, get it if you can endure the stretch from reggae to R&B. Check out the samples and hopefully this helps."
5,GREAT!!!,This is a great CD!!! It consists of Bob Marley tunes performed as contemporary jazz. The fact that Marley's work lends itself so well to such a disimilar genre is a fitting tribute to his work and a testament to his greatness as an artist.
3,Thanks Rit!,"Never could get into Marley until this album. Maybe his politics or lo-fi production just put me off. But I enjoy good musicians playing pop. I would have liked it even more if there were REAL percussion, or that it sounded REAL. Music played to click sounding tracks has its drawbacks. There were some opportunities for good fiery percussion here that were missed. So though I like the positivity and sunny approach to Marleys low-brow musings I couldn't rate this album higher than 3 stars, maybe 3.5 but just not a 4. High octane talent sure.... but, you need REAL sounding drums and percussion. All shine but the too reigned in drummers. I'm a guitar player but I'm nothing with out the sizzle of a great rhythm track. Richard Bona shines brightly. So too Rit. That cast is so great I expected more. However, I probably would've always dissed Marley without this production to open up his music for me. So thanks Rit!"
5,Defintely a great twist of Marley,"If you love the amazing music of Bob Marley and also love jazz, this is the perfect cd for you. The compilations are simply awesome. It's basically smooth jazz versions of Bob Marley's music. Let's be honest though, no one will EVER do Bob Marley's songs better than he does, ever ever! But the musicians on this cd do an OUTSTANDING job upholding the great lyrics of Marley's classics. Throw this cd on and pour yourself a glass of wine and relax...or pop it on for cocktail hour at a party and you've got a winning night. I highly recommend."
1,"Great product, if promised what was in the picture!","Strap was exactly as listed in the picture with everything included except for the seat-belt part which is the most important thing about this replacement part. Know that if you are purchasing this product it DOES NOT include the seat belt, it is just one continuous adjustable strap."
5,a bohemian's bible,"i got this book at a second hand shop and then the same day bought the first one 'living on the earth' , its charming the pages are written in hand text, leaving super amounts of fun to be had within these pages, like a colouringbook for your brain...It also doubles as a colouring book... Talks of digesting food taking thanks for the food... sun songs, your soul mate, meditations, altars, yoga, healing, every budding bohemian should get this book"
5,Reprint this book,Why don't you reprint this book. We want to be able to buy it. I love Living On the Earth and have shared a lot of time with the author through reliving the life she wrote about. Give this book the same opportunity to be savored.
5,Worth a listen,"Another album by Carmen Consoli, another step forward. Lyrics are beatiful as usual and Carmen's sound grew up once again. My favourite songs are ""L'eccezione"", ""Pioggia d'aprile"", ""Mulini a vento"", ""Matilde odiava i gatti"", ""Masino"", ""L'alleanza"" and ""Venti del nord"". If you like this album and want to listen to something else by this singer, buy ""Confusa e felice"" or ""Mediamente Isterica""."
2,Carmen's downfall,"I was shocked not only at how bad this CD was (her earlier efforts are exceptionally good, especially ""Confusa e felice"" and ""Due parole""), but also how bad Consoli looks in the liner photos. As much as I like her earlier albums, this features music that is insipid and uninspired--and occasionally downright annoying. In response to some of the more positive reviews, I've given the album several more listenings for several months, and my opinion hasn't changed. Obviously, a lot of Carmen's fans just don't like this material. As the Romans said (and the Italians later): de gustibus non est disputandum. There's no accounting for taste."
5,The best collection !,Extraordinaria coleecion a un modico precio. Relajese y pongase comodo que esta coleccion traera los mas hermosos recuerdos a su mente.
4,Meeting Lily,"I enjoyed reading Sarah Woodhouse's Meeting Lily. Ms. Woodhouse is a skilled writer of historical romances, but this is the first contemporary romance. The book is slim but captures well the Italian village where a widow Nan, the protagonist, runs a B and B in an old villa. Nan puts up with Lily, a visitor whose elderly husband dies in one of the beds of the villa. Lily does not seem to mind the passing of her mate. She begins to enjoy her freedom again often at the expense of Nan and her staff. Parallel plots involve the seeming affair of the local doctor and another guest, the local priest and the not so long ago memory of the war. Nan's aunt comes to visit, making her question whether she wants to return to England where she grew up. Or will she remain in Italy and find a new love? If you like books set in exotic places, some mystery and romance, Meeting Lily will satisfy you!"
4,"Not quite the same, but still good","I agree with other reviewers, this is not the same recipe I knew as a child (about 20 years ago). The broth tastes the same to me, but the ""wontons"" are not filled with as much chicken as they used contain. However, since I had not seen this soup in 15 years, I was overjoyed to find it and try out one of my old childhood staples! If you want it to be more like the original and have more chicken, I recommend adding Gerber Graduates Chicken Sticks cut into small chunks, it's the same chicken taste and texture. Overall, I'll get this again, whether online or on Amazon. By the way, I found this soup recently at my local WalMart."
3,An OK Thriller,"In the sequel to ""The Mark of the Assassin (Gabriel Allon)"", ex-CIA agent Michael Osbourne is recouping from his physical injuries and gets bored out of his mind playing Mr. Mom. When Osbourne's father in law has taken a position as the USA's ambassador to the Court of St. James, Osbourne willingly comes back to the CIA in order to investigate a new Irish terrorist group as well as protect his relative. Osbourne manages to foil the plot, but the group takes out a contract on his life.The plot actually has two main parts, the Irish terrorists who call themselves ""The Ulster Freedom Brigade""; the second is about Osbourne and the two parts are closely related.This book has most of the same characters as its prequel, but the book is not as enjoyable. The pace is fast but the story is predictable, about half way through (if not sooner) I already figured out the ending which, this time, had no twists.This is an OK thriller, I liked Silva's other books better."
3,Let's Get This Straight,"Let me say first that The Mark of the Assassin and The Marching Season are Michael Osborne and not Gabriel Allon. I would like to read more Michael Osborne, but you can't tell by the way they are listed if they are really Garriel Allon or Osborne, anyone know?So we got rid of some of bad guys in The Marching Season but some of them are still in business so there must me more to come."
4,Good CIA Thriller,"For some reason, I inadvertently read books in a series out of sequence and such is the case here. I read ""The Marching Season"" without having read the first book, ""Mark of the Assassin."" This was a very good book, but I probably won't read its prequel because I now know how things are resolved. In any case, I heartily recommend this novel if you've read the first book. It zips along nicely, is well-crafted, like most Silva novels, and has a lot of suspense and excitement. It gives a pretty clear view of various aspects of ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland. One downer for me is the inclusion in the plot of a malicious global organization which exists only to foment turmoil. I think that's a device that insults the reader. Also, the ending gets crazy and silly. Silva cooks up such a good plot that he doesn't know how to resolve things, so he just makes a mad dash for the exit. In any case, I'm a big Silva fan and I enjoyed this book. If only I had read the other book first....."
4,Irish troubles mixed with globalization,"I love Daniel Silva's later books; this is one of the early ones where he wasdeveloping his style. It's good, full of description, action and suspense, just notas great as the books that came after it."
1,"I'm a Daniel Silva fan, however this book,....?","...is simply awful. That is awful, not awesome. God, what a stinker.Technical details are shallow and/or missing, and the story is so laughable implausable, that for me being a Silva fan caused me to put this sad effort down and then return to it a half dozen times.It is where silly meets dumb and provide for the least interesting characters possible. I found that I was migrating towards minor characters like real estate agents and canines rather than the main and secondary protagonists.I am very glad that Mr.Silva's writing has improved in his later works. This one was, well,...painful.Worse. It was boring."
2,Disappointing,"After completing Mark of the Assassin I couldn't wait to devour The Marching Season. However, I found it disappointing in comparison. Reading more like a travelog of England and Northern Ireland, Silva assumes that you're already familiar with the characters and for those who aren't you'll be left feeling empty. Mark of the Assassin was a page turner - I skipped pages in The Marching Season trying to find the next section of real action. He's still a great read and if you only read this one you'll be impressed."
4,Without Gabriel,"This is one of Daniel's earlier books and does not feature Gabriel Allon. I have read all of Daniel's books except this one and as usual was fascinated at his exacting research, no one does it better. Its easy to see how THE MARCHING SEASON led to the creation of ""Gabriel"" who could have been the one tracking down ""Octoiber."" First of all it is an excellent story beautifuly crafted, a page turner in every sense of the word."
4,Engaging read that entertains,"This is the eight book that I have read by Silva and I have enjoyed all of them. In this book the action sequences were descriptive and vivid with an engaging plot but it was somewhat predictable. It was unusual in that one of the villains, an assassin, had some redeeming values that made him almost likable.The inclusion of a malicious world organization that existed only to foment turmoil for its own financial benefit required suspension of your disbelief system. But the story did have an unexpected ending which I liked.Author of al-Qaeda Strikes Again"
4,"Better than ""Mark of the Assassin""","Based on reviews here, I expected this sequel to ""Mark of the Assassin"" to be tedious. Reading it before I forgot the characters from the first book featuring Michael Osbourne, I actually thought this one was better - a little more depth to the characters, thriller elements clearer, and genuine emotion at times. I still prefer Gabriel Allon to Michael Osbourne, but this novel was good enough to kill time with on a beautiful day in autumn."
3,A typical sequel,"I liked Daniel Silva's ""The Mark of the Assassin"", so I expected I would like ""The Marching Season"" as much, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a sequel to the previous book, with the same main characters, including the title character of the first book. At the end of ""The Mark of the Assassin"" you're told he was killed in a storm escaping his attempt to kill the good guy. Anyone who's ever seen or read any mysteries knows that's a dead giveaway: the assassin's still alive, and of course at some point he gets his cross-hairs on our hero again.I liked this book about as much as I liked ""The Mark of the Assassin"". Silva's a good writer in the Vince Flynn/Stuart Woods line of things. These books aren't literature, the plots (so far anyway) contain no surprises or twists you can't forsee, but they're reasonably well-written and the pages fly by you at a blistering pace. Good for a day or two at the beach."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"After having read ""The Mark of the Assassin"" I was looking forward to read this follow up. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations.Even if the lead characters are all the same and the conflict in Northern Ireland is insightful and interesting the story is much simpler this time. Even worse - the way they bring down the Ulster Freedom Brigade is so simple and unrealistic it almost hurts. (Such a simple trap is all it takes? Give me a break...)After having finished this book I could not get rid of the feeling that the author quickly needed a follow-up to his big (and first) success and did not take enough time to develop a better story.Too bad, a wasted opportunity..."
1,Absolute drivel,"I managed to get through the previous book, but couldn't manage more than 120 pages of this one. The writing is atrocious--it's so bad, I'd swear it was ghost written by an amateur--and the story simply laughable, beyond implausible and yet utterly predictable. The worse aspect of all is wishing the main character would die and why he didn't when there were so many easy opportunities is the biggest mystery of all."
3,OK read,"This is the first Silva book I have read and I picked up this book based on reviews I read on internet that its a worthy read. The story started off promising but stalled in the middle. The ending regained my interest, but if I had never read this book, I would not have missed much."
3,need more of Oct.,"I wish that Oct. had more stories about him. Even though he is an assassin, and bad. I still liked reading about him. Its just fun reading about what is going on in his head and how he deals with his killing. This book was still good, but a slow read. If you read the Mark of the assassin, you should read this one as well. Just don't expect to read it in a few days, like i am used to doing."
2,Formulaic but fast,"I reread this book recently and failed to see why it had stuck out in my mind as one of the better espionage books I had come across. The plot is derivatave, taking elements from authors like Ludlum as well as modern movies...believe me this isn't anything anyone familiar with the genre hasn't seen many times. The main characters are pretty clichéd, the new family man who must return to the CIA (think Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) and the coldhearted assassin who will stop at nothing to fulfill his mission. On the positive side, I was never bored with the book. It hums along on a decent page and builds tension fairly well. Unfortunately, the ending is anticlimactic and the story goes more or less where expected. Basically, if you are looking for the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, this is it."
4,Another top notch thriller from Daniel Silva,Mark of the Assassin was my first read of Silva's and I was intrigued enough to pick up the Marching Season in hardcover. The book starts a bit slow while he introduces the problems in Ireland and from there he picks up steam making the book is hard to put down. I just wish he had developed his characters a little more from where he left them the first time. Don't let that stop you from reading Assassin first and then this one!
4,Worth the effort,Freeman is an excellent writer. I have no background in science and I was able to follow what he was saying. He writes in a clear and simple style.
2,Just bellow average,"Just bellow averageThis book is nothing special, you can find in the internet better 3D computer graphics, so way buy!!"
3,Cut Too Short,"Smooth fabric, light support, thin under clothing. I found it to be a bit too short in length though."
5,Beautiful book.,"This Journal book helps us look at our lives and helps us to ask the questions that can help heal.It helps connect us in a very spirtual manner with God, by opening a dialoge upon the pages.Wonderful gift Idea for anyone with a need to heal. Very creative and beautiful pictures."
3,I admit it..,"I cheated because I got very bored. I hacked into the game and gave myself a million credits after an hour. The good thing about this game is that it plays just like ""Elite"", one of my first and favorite games; and that is one of the bad points as well. Playing the original Elite game took weeks, time I just don't want to spend playing a game anymore. This game looks nicer than Elite and the money-gathering schemes are more complex but you spend a lot of time doing nothing. Too much time."
1,Tedious,"Mr Gunning has tried to wrap up broad cultural and societal themes and notions, many of the letter being unusually personal, about a compelling artist. He ""jump cuts"", so to speak, throughout much of this very long book. But worst of all, he is a tedious and plodding writer, with no distinct style and little energy. From the desriptions, I anticipated a good book, if not a near great one. I expected more background details. rather I began reading and soon found myself swamped and confused by the author's theories and even his descriptions of others'. Couldn't get past forty pages."
4,Odd but excellent,"This book allows you to do what every U2 fan has always wanted to do: go on tour with U2. It is told through the eyes of someone who is doing just that, in a plain, day to day format. Although the arrangement is a bit random, it lets you peek into the offstage life of the band. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book."
5,"Excellent stories, better pictures, must have for a U2 fan.","This is an excellent book, with an excellent way of presentation. The stories are funny, and interesting. The photos are marvelous. If you like U2 you'll love this book!"
2,A Misleading Representation of Wineries in Napa and Sonoma,"Do not be mislead by the book - it IS NOT a complete guide to Napa and Sonoma County wineries. While this book has great historical and wine production reference information,it seems to be a pay to play publication. Many of these books feature only wineries that are willing to pay to be a part of the publication, If you don't pay, you're winery is not included. Many, many fine wineries in both Sonoma and Napa are not listed in this book. DO NOT use it as a guide to all wineries in the area - you will miss many of the best. Some of the smallest wineries, with limited budgets have the best wine - they are not represented in this book - probably because they couldn't afford to pay for inclusion. The so called ""Master List"" in the back is very misleading - it is missing many wineries. Use the free publication ""Wine Country This Week"" for a complete list of all wineries in Sonoma and Napa Counties! The same goes for the restaurants and lodging."
2,Interesting Ankle Support,"I got it and it just seems odd. I like the idea of magnets but they are right on the ball of my ankle, not anywhere else. It doesn't fit very well. I wear a size 10.5 shoe and the brace is big. Doesn't close tightly enough and it covers your entire heal which to me feels funny in a shoe. Plus $7.50 for shipping. I'll look elsewhere next time."
3,better than no shoes at all...,"these shoes are comfortable and cost less than the dansko clogs that they resemble, but if you wear them every day like i do, you may find that they don't hold their shape very well.i have had two pairs and in both of them, at least one of the toes caved in. if you don't care what they look like, they're great. really comfortable, but the toe thing... not so good."
2,Definatly not Dansko!,"My wife bought these clogs so she will now write the review. I thought maybe these clogs since they looked so much alike would be comparable to Dansko clogs, which I love. However they are definaly not! They hurt my feet over the arches and my legs are so fatigued by the end of the day that I hardly want to walk. However, they do look nice and give me the extra height that I want."
5,Better than bedroom slippers!,"I love these shoes and practically live in them. I've had mine since December and haven't had the experience others have had with creases. Mine are only just now starting to wear out a bit in the back where I slip my foot in. As an added bonus, the little platform gives you a lift, which is great if you're short like me, but hate wearing high heels. Comfortable, sturdy, casual--I'm getting another pair."
3,"Comfortable, but",These shoes are incredibly comfortable. The only disappointment I have with them is that I started getting creases in the toes after only one wearing. It would be nice if they were a bit more solid in the toe area.
3,Beautiful pages and A lot of Info but Doesn't have a lot of info on the Newest models!,Positive:Beautiful pagesDescriptive InformationBig bookGreat book materialNegative:I got this for my boyfriend and I think he would be more interested in the newer models like the 911 Turbo then the first Porsche. I expected the book to talk about everything! This book just basically focused on the first models and how it was created and such. Not on the recent models. So that kind of disappointed me.
5,"Porsche "" The Road From Zuffenhausen "" , Pristine Book !!","Porsche , the road from zuffenhausen is a wonderful book regarding the historical perspectives of porsche cars !! A great book for porsche fans,collector's and historians ! The complete history of all model porsche cars , many beautiful photos and original documents and posters ! A great reference book for the porsche owner ! The best porsche book on the market ! A great coffee table porsche book !"
4,"A good 50,000 Foot Overview","If you have toured a Vanderbilt house in Newport RI, Hyde Park NY, Northport NY, Florham NJ, or in New York City (Yes, one of the original Vanderbilt homes is a store on 5th Avenue and 52rd Street) and have had your interested piqued, then this is a excellent book for an overview of the family and there beginnings. The book never goes very deep but gives you a very good understanding of how the Commodore made his first $95 million and how his son, William, turned it into almost $200 million. But the best part of the book helps you understand how the next generation of William II and Cornelius III and wives spent almost all of the incredible fortune. The author, Arthur Vandy, is kinder to Alva than most books, but hey, they are related."
5,Juicy Gossip,I LOVE THIS BOOK.I can read it again & again & never get tired dreaming about the characters described in this book & the lives they lived.It takes you from beginning to end.Pennies on a Dollar????A Lesson to be Learned.Never to be forgotten.
4,A family affair,"Fortune's Children was a good read for anyone interested in how the rich lived in the late 1800's. The author detailed the main characters very well as well as the over the top, outlandish homes that these characters resided in. It is truly a nice look into that era and what it all meant to be a Vanderbilt. Reading this book has piqued my interest in other books about the first rich family of America. Once I began reading this book I had trouble putting it down."
5,Teresa Brewer/ Dixieland Band,Very Nice Dixieland LP by Teresa. That gal could sing everything.Thank CORAL Records for a nice recording!
3,A good recorder for the price.,"This recorder is still hard to come by. I have had about 30 days experience with it, and here are my thoughts. The good: 1) Intuitive menu's that I have grown to appreciate 2) burns a disc successfully and plays on my 3 other dvd players in the house. Here is the not so good: 1) 1 button record only records, for example, it does not give you the option of 30 minutes, 60 minutes and so on. I wish it would. 2) It is finicky playing audio cd's. This is a big drawback. 3) I think it takes a while to load the disc (I am not sure if that is representative of all recorders, but it seems a little long 4) It's odd that the S-Video port is not enabled out of the box. You need to be aware of this before you return it. Hook it up to a composite video source first and then enable the s-video. Lite-on has a good reptuation for their PC products. This unit appears to have positive reviews overseas."
1,GREAT JUNK-RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!,Hi and good day...I burn alot...so I thought I would like to own a back up burner (just in case) BAD IDEA!!!I paid $199.99 at some other place (BB) hooked her up and nothing.....All the s-video connects were NOT funtional...sent it back...denied I ever owned it ...if only for a few hours
1,Glad someone liked it,"I, too, like one of the other reviewers, had trouble with the S-video connects: both were bad. Took it back for another, and this one was defective, also.Another example of gettigng what you pay for. There's a good reason that the next cheapest (name brand) recorder is $150 more..."
4,Good player/recorder,"Just bought the Liteon DVD Recorder. I was charmed about the price (euro 300,in the Netherlands). I had doubts when I had read all reviews. Then the salesman told me that it was impossible to swap channels in order to put your favorites at top. At home I discovered he was right. But after updating the firmware a menu item was added and channels could be put into any order.I am pleased with this DVD recorder, it does what is supposed to do and has a very good recording/playback picture quality. Even at EP (4 hours/dvd) the picture quality outranks my old VCR.The only negatives points I found so far are the relatively slow start up and the strange noise it makes when it is switched on.If you have questions you can mail me at: max@ffkijken.com"
2,If it would only continue to work,"I purchased this unit in June 2004 for Father's Day. I loved it. We burned over 200 DVDs with only a few problems. Then after 6 months of use we started noticing a few problems here and there. First it would skip in playback mode, then it not allow me to finalize the DVD, then it recorded the video just fine and dropped the audio.After 8 months of use, I selected ""open"" to eject the disk, out came the disk along with a smaller white foam/rubber disk. It was the piece that helps to hold down the DVD while reading and recording (I assume). I took it back to the store (had the extended warranty)and they gave me a new one to replace it. It was DOA right out of the box (""Fail"" came up on the LED screen).I've definitely lost my confidence in Lite-On. Too bad, it was a great unit while it worked."
2,Wait for a better recorder,"It worked well when it did work.1)Poor video output. Output from the recorder is dark and you lose lots of details in the shadow area.2)Destroy DVD if you attempt to record more than space that you have left on DVD. Not intelligent enough to stop recording when you run out of space.3)If you hit the record button and walk away and forget to stop it, it kills the DVD media. See #2.4)It died on me after 6 months of casual use. Was able to record 15 DVD before it died."
1,Doesn't last,I purchased this recorder depending on Lite-on's great name. Unfortuneately right after the warrenty ran out the recorder died. I didn't use it very much at all.It stopped reading DVD +/-R and would only record on DVD+RW for 1 minute before failing. For a Lite-on I expected a lot more than 14 months of minimal use before dying. While it worked it worked great. I would buy an extended warrenty on my next recorder. The life span is too short for the money.
2,"Great TV, terrible DVD player","Ours also has great picture and sound, but ours also stopped playing any DVD's whatsoever within a few months of purchase. Unplugging it as the support dudes suggested seemed to make the problem worse. It would be fine if we were just using it as a TV, but we bought it specifically to watch DVD's on, which isn't so great for us."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON,"I ordered the item on NOV 28th. IT WAS NOT SHIPPED UNTIL 8DAYS LATER!!! AMAZON DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE SHIPPING WILL BE DELAYED. ORIGINAL ESTIMATED SHIPPING DATE WAS DEC 4TH AND ESTIMPATED DELIVERY DATE WAS BETWEEN THE 8TH AND 12TH. NOW THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE IS 15TH-22ND. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON! I'M GOING TO SEND THIS TV BACK TO THEM..THEY DONT DESERVE MY BUSINESS. I'M SURE THE TV ITSELF IS A NICE TV, I WILL GET IT FROM SOMEBODY MORE RELIABLE. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS."
4,Very hot. Not for the faint of heart.,"Very hot. Not for the faint of heart.Purchased one for my daughter, and one for a friend.I discovered this after buying Death Rain Potato Chips."
2,Boring and repetitive,"This book is ok. It follows the concept of Halo: Combat Evolved. In fact it's basically a game script because the exact same things happen in the book as in the game. The Master Chief gets in a billion fights, and its really fastpaced. The thing is, it gets really old really fast. It's basically M. C. running around and shooting hundreds of guys every page, a book shouldn't be like your playing the game. The only thing I really like was the other Marines and their story of struggle. The Covenant's point of view during the story wasn't bad either. Overall, it's an alright book. I wouldn't recommend it, but if your a die-hard Halo fan go ahead and buy it, otherwise borrow it or steer clear of it. Play the game, it's funner."
4,It's ok....,"It's not as good as the first one. They make everyone seem dumber and Master Chief a lot weaker and reckless, like jumping straight in with [firearms]blazing. He doesn't seem to careful like in the Fall Of Reach. The author keeps on confusing the gender of some of the characters, but if you ignore that little problem the book it alright."
2,Mirrors the game,"Maybe it's because I've played the game so many times, but I found this something of a slow read. I'm glad I read just for its filling in the gaps in the storyline from the game. If you're not a die hard fan of Halo, you might want to pass on this one."
4,Halo: The Flood,"This book deserves as much as it does. The game followed the storyline of only the Master Chief, when this followed all the stories. 'Zamamee, Yapyap, and McKay. This book is very interesting, and gets insane at the end. The auther did skip a lot of detail though - but it would just be the same thing over and over again if the author didn't. Why would you want to hear 'He grabbed a flood and popped it' twenty times in a row?"
2,"Okay, not nearly as good as The Fall of Reach","This book is an acceptable action romp, with plenty of action and gore and etc. However, it suffers from two major flaws. Both can be overlooked, but this book isn't going to be winning any awards.First, the author just isn't that good. The Coventant aren't very convincing, and the marines hollow stereotypes. The description of the actions scenes is passable, but all two often degrades into ""Master Chief shot so and so, then turned and shot so and so."" Hardly what we want when we can just play the game and get the same effect.Which leads me to the books second major flaw: it's basically the game translated into book form. The parts with the marines are interesting, and fill in some of the background material the game was missing, but the parts with the Master Chief (comprising probably 70% of the book) are scene by scene adaptations of the game, with very little new.The final word? For the average reader, not worth the time. For Halo fans, buy it used."
1,not very good,"i thought that the book was not very good the first book was much better. In the first book ""the fall of reach"" you learn about the Master Chief and the Spartans you learn why Master Chief is the only one of his kind left. you learn all about his training and it leads up to the game perfectly....but when i read the second book ""the flood"" i thought it shouldnt have been written.... maybe if you havent played the game you should read it but for all of us [real] Halo fans you played the game and already know whats going to happen. so i wasnt really into the book because i already knew the outcome. In ""the fall of reach"" you dont know whats going to happen next. so i recomend reading Halo ""the fall of reach"""
5,Excellent!!,The Book based on the first Halo Game is was so cool reading the book and having the corresponding memory of playing the game. If your a Halo fan this is a must read.
2,Where's Eric Nylund ??,"Who ever take Eric away n put in this guy deserve a full clip of plasma rifle in the butt.I read many, many books. Plenty I had finished more than once.But this book give me hard time finishing it.Kill, kill.. shoot, shoot,.. boring, boring..Where's the imaginative aspect of novelty?If I want to read about emptying clips and reload again.I'ld have watched John Woo's movie."
4,Worth it! - Just what I needed,"This was perfect. Just what I needed to fill in some of the blanks. After reading this book go back and play the game again. Dietz does a nice job to fill in all the extra action that takes place throughout the story. It also tells the story of Halo from the Covenants point of view and their opinion on the war with the flood, Halo, and the humans. The battles with the Marines were cool, providing you a different look at the game from different character's perspectives. Although there were some minor discrepancies (mostly editing) I really enjoyed this book with its intense connection to Halo the game."
4,Halo [The Flood],"Halo the flood, was a pretty good book. It had Humans, Aliens, and mutans all killing each other. Master cheif is a sparten that likes blowing up stuff that gets in his way. I hope you get this book because it's really good."
1,totally worthless book,this book totally follows the game almost word for word it goes into a little more detail but its useless detail. if youve played the games at least once there is no reason to read this book. however the first book (fall of reach) and the third book (first strike) are a thousand times better with a better author (eric nylund)
1,legendary,"I recommend that you read this book on the ""legendary"" difficulty setting. You will have to read and re-read certain sections endlessly, but you'll finish the book with bragging rights. Do you really want to tell your friends that you only read this book on ""normal?"""
2,My least favorite book of the series.,"And for good reason. The book doesn't really delve into any backstory or characters. It's basically a walkthrough of the game. Some parts are really good, but then go into pages upon pages of Master Chief mowing down Covenant and Flood. I just couldn't give it more than two stars because there were just too many pages of mindless killing of Covenant. We understand the book is based off of a video game, but it doesn't need to be an exact walkthrough of the game. I'd like to see future authors branch out a little more and really create more of a Halo Universe. Definitely a skipable book in the Halo series."
3,you could just play the game...,"this is a pretty good book, but it is exactly the same as the game. its pretty much just ""master chief runs over here, shoots this, shoots that"" and gets pretty repetitive. ill give the author credit for putting a game into a book so exactly (its even got the exact places where enemies are located in the game correct)and i understand how hard it would be to do. it does have some side stories that dont appear in the game but when it comes to playing a video game or reading a book, they dont really dont support it much for me. so, if you have already played the game, then there is really no reason for you to read this. but if you havent played it, maybe you can read this first and it will give you an advantage in the game. in my opinion, this didnt really need to be written for the saga."
4,Almost.....,Almost as good as the first book (Fall of Reach). I found it interesting because you could very easily visualize everything you were reading after having played the game(twice!!). That is one thing to keep in mind though. It is just the game in book form so if you didn't like the game then you will probably not like the book either. If you're a fan of the game though it's a definite read!
4,Good but slow,The first Book is better then the second book becuse the second book is slower and William C. Dietz could of don better on it. I think this Book would of ben the best if Eric Nelond Did it.
2,"Ironically, this is the wrong book for a Halo fan to read.","The people who are the target demographic of Halo novels - namely, people who've played Halo games - will not be well-served by this book. It really is just a recapitulation of the first entry in the game series, focusing almost completely on action, and even then not very well.Boasting that your futuristic pistol can ""reach out and touch someone"" is not what you'd call high art in terms of prose, but that's not the real issue. The problem is the direct description of the game as it goes from level to level and room to room. Getting lost in the confusing map design of the library level? That's actually in here, and not in a charming way. It grinds the story to a halt. It all feels like a retread of the story you know very, very well.Anyone who wants to get more out of the Halo universe should go to the other books to expand it. This one's too familiar."
2,Halo: The Flood,"Halo: The Flood would be great if you wanted a book that read like a war video game, which is what it came from. It would be a good story without the constant battle scenes. Unless you are into war, give it a miss."
2,If you've played the first game don't bother....,Just like the title says ...if you've played the first game then save your money and read the next one. Just like the game but gives you a bit more detail on the events. Found myself skipping entire chapters on this one.
5,great for book reports,Halo ce is easily in my top 5 games of all time and I love the rest of the games (3 is my favorite) so I decided to read this book when I was assigned a book report on a science fiction book. It is great because after the first chapter you begin to realise that this is basically a narrative of the game. Play the game and you get a book report and Np teacher cares enough to look into it! :) this book is also cool because I picked it up and read it a couple months later because I was bored and I discovered that it is a great book to find out what happens with everyone else from the pillar of autumn. It really goes into great detail and has a great story. I would give it six stars if I could!
3,Too much game not enough story,"This book was really good,however in the whole length of the book there was hardly any story or speech. I believe that the writer was explaining the actual Anniversary game than a story. I recommend this book to people who like the Anniversary game but not a Halo story."
1,Replaying the video game would be more interesting.,"The Fall of Reach brought real richness to the Halo universe in terms of history and characterization. It's a book based on a video game, sure, but it doesn't insult your intelligence and gives your imagination some new space to roam.In contrast, everything in The Flood is dumbed down. There's little sense of wonder, some things don't make much sense, and the battles are formulaic. Even the prose gets repetitive. For instance, every ship that is hit ""shudders"" before going down. I got bored, gave it another few chapters, and then shelved it.I would recommend skipping this book and replaying the video game."
2,Disappointing if you've played the game,"The only people I can recommend this book to are those who have not played Halo but wish to play Halo 2. It basically tells, blow by blow, exactly what happens in the first game and what astute players were supposed to infer from hints dropped through the game.It's competently enough written, but is a waste of time if you want more from the Halo universe. Try ""First Strike"" instead, which takes place immediately after Halo."
2,"If you have played Halo, you have already ""read"" this book!","If you haven't played the Xbox game Halo then this book is not a bad read. It will completely ruin the story for you if you ever do play the game though.The best way I can describe Halo: The Flood is if someone sat next to you while you played the game and just wrote down everything that happened, added some extra dialog and ""off-screen"" action and put it all in a paperback novel. I couldn't wait to finish it, but of course...I knew how it was going to end before I even started reading it.If you haven't played the game and never intend to, it probably deserves a 4 out of 5, but if you have played the game don't even bother."
2,Terrible book,I have only read this book once and it was several years ago but I still feel the taste of disgust in my mouth when thinking about it. This book is not a fun read nor does it add anything interesting to the Halo Universe. The Forerunner Saga and The Fall of Reach are much more worthy of your time.
2,Its been awhile since I have read a book that fails on so many levels,The title and cover say HALO but you wouldn't know it to read this book. Whereas The Fall of Reach and Fleet Strike were light and fun The Flood is painful. Basically the problem that I had with this installment is that both Master Chief and Cortana behave in ways dissimilar to their ingame personas and new characters when introduced prove boring and tedious to read.Overall-It's the literary equivalent of having the author hit you with a baseball bat for 200 pages and that's difficult for me to say because I love all things HALO.
3,Good book but repetitive at times,"First off, I want to say that I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and it really portrayed the first Halo game well.That being said, I think it portrayed the first game too well. In fact, it seems as though the author played the game over and over, took meticulous notes, and recreated the game verbatim in print. There was way too much killing and reloading. The book paints the Master chief as an indestructible war machine who can kill hundreds of covenant and flood without breaking a sweat. While that may be true in the game, it didn't translate well for me in the book.Now don't get me wrong, the book isn't bad. I just think Dietz went a bit overboard with all the combat narratives. There were many enjoyable parts, such as the story of the OSDT marines which wasn't told during the game. I enjoyed the character of Major Silva and his interactions with the Master Chief."
3,It's ok........,"My question is why have a different author right one book out of a three book set?.. Having said that, the mood is completely different as well as the angles from the first book Fall of Reach. The book is ok and does give a little background that the game does not. How ever, having said that I was bored with this book at times because it feels like you are watching somebody play the game over their shoulder. It's an ok book, but falls short of Fall of Reach. Have not read First Strike yet, hopefully it will recover what is left of this series"
3,Halo: The Flood,"This book was ok but it was not as good ""The Fall of Reach"". I have beat the X-box game Halo and I was hoping for some different information outside of the game. The book basically followed a liner path and if you played the game, wasn't very interesting. No new technologies or weapons were explained or introduced. I was hoping for some new insights on the Covenant or the Flood that the game didn't already explain but there was nothing. In the end of the book Spartan 117 is floating in space just as the game ended. I was hoping the auther would have set something up for the next game or story. If you like sci-fi space-marine action as I do and you havent played Halo on X-Box you should enjoy this book."
1,Why is this book averaging five stars?,"Fail. Not even mildly interesting. This book is 90% ""Then the Chief shot this guy, then he threw a grenade at these guys and then he ran to the next room, and he shot this guy with a 7.99mm bullet, and killed 4 guys with a 108mm rocket, and another flying guy came and he shot that guy too...""Mind-numbingly badly written. Yes two adverbs. The story takes backseat to the action, which is cluttered nonsensical and confusing. Poor. Book 1 was ' better."
4,A Good Companion To The XBOX Game!,"This is the second installment of the Halo novel trilogy. I loved the first book, THE FALL OF REACH, this novel pretty much follows the action in the first Halo XBOX game. In THE FLOOD, if you like action and near incessant warfare, there is plenty of it here. You can't read more than three or four pages without something violent occurring. The Flood is vicious, never mind what the Covenant is up to! Compared to the first novel in the trilogy this one seems much more superfical, with it's nearly unending parade of violence, and interpersonal relationships take a back seat here. Nevertheless, it IS part of the trilogy and worth reading, to learn the details of what is really behind the XBOX Halo games, written in an easy to read style, if somewhat shallow."
5,Halo The Flood,I think that halo is one of the best games to ever be into a book.I play The game and its the best game for xbox.If people don't Agree I ThINK they are one of the Dums Person ever.
4,"Fates Warning : ""Live In Athens""","Although Fates Warning doesn't go for all the big stage props / visual effects, they put on one very tight, and heavy live effort here on ""Live In Athens"". Like many have stated, the dual axe attack of F. Aresti / J. Matheos are worth the purchace price alone. On top of those two battling, the set list is excellent...They scan alomost every era of their 20 years in Metal, and being that this was recorded just last year{2005}, it's amazing to see how much Fates may still have to offer today. This is a great live performace, and without question the best Fates has sounded in years...I've seen other various live Fates recordings, and none come close to touching this in terms of production or precision...."
4,Future Music,"This magazine is invaluable for the present-day producer.I produce hip hop tracks and find that this particular magazine is tailored perfectly to the producer who works much with virtual instruments, plug-ins and the like.Each month's issue also comes with a bonus CD that includes plug-in demos (often free fully-functional plugins), tutorial videos, sound samples, etc. This, for me, puts ""Future Music"" in a different league than other magazines.Mags like Mix and EQ are great - covering a wider scope of music and music-for-film production, but for the producer working with a Digital Audio Workstation, ""Future Music"" is probably the best ""get right down to business"" audio magazine available.Highly Recommended."
1,Better Watch Out!,I sent in a card for a preview issue and never recieved it. Since then I've been bombarded with with forceful Must Pay notices. They've now turned me over to a collection agency. I've not to this day subscribed.
1,No longer publish!,"This mag is not publish anymore as told in previous reviews. They won't tell you instead I got a note that said I would get Guitar World, and got 1 issue only. Not only I just got 1 issue, but I never asked for guitar world. Please take note that Amazon is very good at everything except mag subscriptions. They send you with the publisher to deal with. No refund are made this way. Also this happened with the Mental Floss mag subscription. Your are on your own with magazine subscriptions."
1,BEWARE!!!,"Just like another reviewer, I sent in the card for a preview issue. I did receive one issue, which I found to be of limited value anyway. I have since been bombarded with collection agency notices. I can't believe I may have to get legal help for this. Absolute rubbish."
1,This magazine is no longer in circulation.,Don't buy this magazine sub! The company no longer makes FM for the US. I have a two year sub and they never told me they stopped making FM US. They just started sending me Guitar World. I don't even play guitar!!!DON'T BUY THIS SUBSCRIPTION.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...
5,Great Photos of Nebraska,"I love this book. It's a durable hardcover, not too large or heavy, with just the right pictures to capture both urban and rural Nebraska people, places, landscapes, and wildlife."
2,Poor sound,I wanted this disk because it had some Wilbert Harrison tracks that don't seem to be otherwise available.But the sound is loud and 'boomy'Recommended for hard-core collectors only.
2,Poorly constructed,"The T-shirt is gorgeous and my son loves it. Unfortunately, I had to repair the seams in the shoulder before it was even washed!"
2,"Beautiful color XXXL runs VERY SMALL, Must RETURN","I'm very sad I had order from this company years ago and am still wearing them. So when I found The Mountain Tee Again I was excited and order my normal SZ XXXL. which always fits very loose (use as night shirts) should be a 26/28 NOT. NOT EVEN CLOSE. It's runs like a 22/24. When I laid it against my old shirts even the shoulders seam was 2 inches less. The color purple is a rich true purple, still heavy cotton, vivid design but just too tight all over. Never had this problem before.The seller shiped fast, hopefully the return will go as well"
4,Recommended,"Very funny story about what a guy whose father is a mob boss does when he finds out his girlfriend's father is the FBI agent investigating his family. The story features many over-the-top hilarious scenes and is well worth your time to read. I would have given this story 4 1/2 stars if able, because I thought it was so well done. If you've read any of Gordon Korman's books, your will recognize his style of humor, but I didn't think this one was quite up to NO MORE DEAD DOGS or BORN TO ROCK. Recommended."""
3,Son of the Mob,The Son of the Mob is a great book about the hecttic life of a teenage boy. The weird thing is that Vinces the main characters dad is the Mob leader of NYC (the Godfather). Vinces love Kendra is a big part of his life but her father is a FBI agent trying to get Vinces dad away forever. Although this book is very slow it was lightly funny overall it was pretty good.
5,Hilarious,"This was an entertaining, laugh-out-loud book! Max Casella was awesome as the reader, and his voices are very believable. I was swept into the interesting story immediately, and it never lost my attention. Korman created in-depth characters and a great plot with comedy, romance, and suspense!"
5,Mafia Mayhem,"Although as hilarious as any of Korman's books, this book is more appropriate for older readers. Of course, I started reading the author's books when I was 7, so ""older"" is a relative term. That's probably why these memorable characters reminded me of a mafia-based dinner theater I wrote, although I wish I'd thought of ""Uncle Pampers"" first. The writing style is believable, as if the book were a memoir from your average ambivalent son of a notorious mobster. Main character Vince Luca is ignored at school by everyone but his new girlfriend and his newly jealous best friend Alex. Poor Alex spends most of the book third wheeling with Vince and Kendra or watching Star Trek reruns in his basement. Vince's attempts to keep the family ""business"" a secret from Kendra only tangles him further in a web of ridiculousness. Ciao."
2,Freakin idiot...GOSH!,"This book is a very easy book to read. If you like to have an easy read type of book i would reccommend it to anyone. The main character is 17 yeards old, but his language and reactions are that of a 12 year old. Some of the stuff he does can be childish, in the fact that he acts younger than he actually is. This book should be read by 6-7th graders."
3,Mob?,"When this said mob, I chose it to read thinking there would be action and killings. I after all did enjoy all his other books. After reading it, I thought it was just O.K. I did find it was geared towards girls because of all the romance. I would probably only recommend this for a quick read or a book report."
2,Not a Guy Book,"In this book there is a kid named Vince Luca. He is a high school student whose life is different than anyone else's. His dad is a mob boss, making his life really weird. Vince's dad is constantly interfering with his dating life. Vince's brother also works in the mob with his father. When his brother and his dad try to help him with his dating things go horribly wrong. Then he meets a girl he really likes, but he can tell his family about it because her father works for the FBI. Her dad has been trying to put Vince's dad in jail for years.I dislike the title of this book. It is very misleading. When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be filled with action and cool things, but in reality it is a book about dating.I think a girl would like this book. I has a lot of dating things in it."
4,Son of the Mob,"Son of the Mob is about a 17 yr. old boy named Vince(ya cool name)who's dad is the mob king. He has to go through finding almost dead people in his trunk on a date, getting very unusual presents(Chapter 4), and dating the FBI agent's daughter(the agent that stakes out there house).He doesn't want anything to do with his fathers business. Vince eventually gets sucked into the business and barely knows he's in it.Gordan Korman does on awesome job in this book of keeping the reader glued to the book. All genders will love this book. It is hilarious!! There are many different kinds of action in it, if you know what I mean. It shows you a little bit of what the mob is like, and what their kids have to go through. This is a great book for anybody."
4,this book is chill,"The Son of the Mob, written by Gordan Korman was a great or should I say outstanding novel. Vince- maincharacter, has never had very much luck with relationships. This is all due to his fathers ""Vending machine business."" His luck finally turns his way when he meets the girl of his dreams. Although this relationship is almost sacrificed by his fathers business. Read more to find out how Vince'ssocial life is almost put to an end all due to his fathers business"
3,Son of the Mob,"Son of the Mob, by Gordon Korman, is about a young boy who's father is one of the most respected men in the mob. Although having a father in the mob could be handy at some times, Vince hated it. And once Vince got involved, he couln't get out, and perhaps was going to lose true love and a life of his own.Son of the Mob was a book that made me realize what it can be like having people around you that you don't really know the truth about. It also made me realize that some people have people watching them and listening to them all the time every day, and maybe never knowing that nothing is personal in the mob. And sometimes the truth hurts, but you are going to find out some time but it is easier to find out in the begining.I think this book would be a great book to sit down and read."
5,Really great!,"Son of the Mob was fantastic. I bought this version (on cassette) because I'm a huge Max Casella fan, and he's great - but so is the story! The whole thing is full of comedy. From the first body in the trunk to the last FBI agent, from ilovemycat.usa to Uncle Pampers singing karaoke, the book's super and I couldn't stop listening to it. One of the really great factors was the characters - besides Vince, I really loved how Gordan Korman made Alex. I hope there's a sequel!"
3,Good with some modifications,"We purchased this to keep our 2 Boxers safely in the back of our SUV on long trips. It installs using tension between the ceiling of the car and the floor of the cargo area. Unfortunately, mid-way through our first trip using this it decided to fall over. We have an all season floor-mat in the cargo area and I think it shifted slightly, releasing the tension on the barrier and allowing the barrier to come loose. Needless to say, this created quite a hazard when the barrier toppled over onto our dogs. We immediately had to pull over and fix it. The dogs were freaked out and we were too. To prevent this problem, we wrapped bungee cords around the barrier and around the posts of the rear headrests. This firmly secured the barrier so that it could not come loose or fall. We kept the barrier in place for over a year with that arrangement and it worked fine. My only complaint is that it did occasionally rattle and it left a slight impression in the roof of the vehicle."
1,Lethal object,"If you think having a large piece of metal hurtling around inside your car in an accident is a good idea, you should consider this product. Otherwise look elsewhere."
1,Totally trivial and poorly written,"I read this book a few years ago - correction - I read it about half way through and got so disgusted by its triviality of content and terrible prose that I flung it back into my bookcase.I largely agree with ""A reader from Lakewood, CO United States"" and can't comprehend why anyone could have a positive opinion about this book.The book has some significance, be it a very negative one, viz. that its bad, cobbled together content, by, mind you, the man in charge of the MIT Media Lab, symbolizes the typical ignorance of many scientists regarding the historical, socio-cultural context in which new technology should be viewed.I would recommend a crash course in Lewis Mumford's great ideas, as discussed in Technics and Civilization and the Myth of the Machine, to all students embarking on high-tech research and development."
4,"BAD AMAZON SERVICE, AGAIN",IT IS THE FOURTH TIME AN ORDER FROM AMAZON IS LOST. Are you still asking me to review a product that was never delivered. Can i ask back how can I get my money back?
1,diary of an egomaniac,"Negroponte is the man who created Wired Magazine and then had them put his face on the cover and give him made-up awards. It is hard to point to any important discovery coming from him or the MIT Media Lab, except perhaps the invention of hype."
3,"Important, but ultimately not far-reaching enough","Computer use will soon be as unavoidable as cash use is now, those digital illiterates will need books like this as an important introduction.However, negroponte is too restrictive in his ideas. OK, he works at the Media Lab at MIT so his research focuses on media & comms. But being digital is about so much more than being able to throw away the TV Listings and not needing to answer the phone.When we are truly digital, it will be about freeing your data from geographical and political constraints. Yes, even the constraints of time itself.If you're new to it all, or if you're too focused on Binary tree algorithms read this book. Even the techies should look up from the command line once in a while."
2,"If You Know What a Network is, Don't Expect Much","I had a hard time assigning a ""rating"" this book. On one hand it does raise some interesting issues, but on the other, most of the issues are somewhat obvious IF you have an understanding of networks. If you have a technical background and know what a bit is, don't bother with this book.The author is really hung up on the word ""bit"" to the point that I found myself shouting ""ok, shut up, I understand"" as I read the book.I have difficulty recommending this book to the technically challenged as well. It won't explain how a network works. It will not explain the Internet. In fact it doesn't explain much of anything, except.... it DOES do a good job explaining the various modes of tranmitting bits and the limitations. It was because of this I gave it 2 stars.The book does seem dated. Many of the technologies he talks about are already in the PointCast software."
1,Absolute drivel: Remarkably content-free,"This work, taken either in context of its original 1995 or today, is essentially a compilation of whining complaints against technology and uninspired dreams for the future. For the bulk of the complaints, Mr. Negroponte is a technologist and should know better. And as far as ideas for a better, brighter world, any B-rate science fiction novel will offer richer content. Don't waste your money."
5,A MUST READ,"Anyone who plans to live longer than a month needs to read this book. Negroponte's insightful view of where our technology is leading us is not only envigorating, but a fun read too! Even for the technology illiterates this book is well worth checking out. Everyone should read this"
3,the future didn't come true.,"I have to say that this book could be very interesting if we were in 1995 or 1996. But from the modern perspective, this book is too simplified and optimistic. I can't deny that some anticipations in this book may come true in the future, but obviously, not now, in 2002."
3,Sleek but complicated,"I purchased 6 of these for work. Of that 6, three have to be sent back for repairs. Not a good percentage.The menu is complicated and there is NOTHING intuitive about the usage of this device. I actually had to read the manual to figure out how to schedule a recording manually and burn it to a DVD that will play on regular players. I usually NEVER have to read manuals.On the positive, the devices look sleek and professional. They have very large hard drives and when they work, they work well."
3,Network Navigation,"Purchased my unit at the end of November, and recv'd in good order from Amazon. Everything seems to be working fine (I haven't tried working w/the DVD-Ram yet, or burning to disc), with one exception. I have encountered a problem w/Network Navigation. It won't work with Internet Explorer 7. I phoned Customer Service and was told that an update to resolve this issue wasn't even in works. Perhaps they are waiting for Vista, but as this seems to be the Toshiba HDD-DVD flagship, and IE7 has been out for a while now, I feel like this should have been addressed before now. The Unit itself would have recv'd 4 stars (it is fairly complicated), but this issue drops my rating, as this was one of the features I was looking forward to using. So before you spend a day crawling around in your attic to run a network cable (like I did), check your browser."
2,useful,"real shortthis isn't a High Definition recorder.the TV guide is compatible with Cable TV.very difficult to use.I paid over $500, I wouldn't reccomend it, given the price."
2,nice design but blade keeps comming out,"I have the original superknife and I bought this one because the original required you to remove a screw to replace the blade. This one has simplified the process. The thumb stud that opens the blade is also the unlocking mechanism for the blade. The only problem is that I've found that I accidentally push down on the stud, thereby releasing the blade, while I""m using the knife. I suggest going to Superkinfe's website and buying one of the newer models in the hopes that they have corrected this little glitch."
3,Almost perfect,This knife is so close to perfect. Very light. Very easy blade release and awesome one handed opening. The only flaw is that the blade has come out a few times while I've been using it which could be a major issue. I may just have a defective one.
2,NOT a Gerber,I bought this knive because it was advertised as a GERBER (Legendary Blades). It IS NOT a GERBER. SK knife. Cheap feel; OK for the $.
2,Blade constantly falls out,"It is almost totally useless. The blade falls out, even if you are absolutely sure your thumb is nowhere near the blade release pin. Push it into drywall, pull, and watch the blade come loose and fall out. This is with the stock ""Superknife"" blade, so you'd think that would be compatible with the knife. I wrote to the company today hoping for a resolution, but a visit to their website looks like they are heading for trouble: only one knife is listed and they used to make several. I'd say do not buy these knives. They look great and feel great - the quality of the build is there, but they don't work. A near miss; and dangerous."
1,Do not buy!,Poorly designed. Blade falls out when open and being used. I spend as much time picking up my blade as I do cutting anything. I work in a lumber yard and use knives for everything from opening boxes and packing slips to cutting plastic bands on bunks of lumber. This knife has a faulty blade lock. And I don't think the thing is even made by Gerber like advertised. Nowhere on the knife or the packaging does it reference Gerber. Go figure.Laters
5,Dealing with Loss from a defeated Confederate soldier....Rebel Private,"My son introduced me to this book. I found it not only a great source of original material on the history of the Civil War, but even more, it was fascinating to read the author's candid philosphies of life and how he came to view the dead soldiers from the other side with little emotion but felt enormous symathy for the wounded who were still living. His post-war adjustment to life and his changing views as to how to relate to the victors also gives us a good direction to take when our own political views have not won the day. The book is refreshing for its candor as much as for the historical material it contains."
3,Interesting but incomplete,"While the narrative centered around camp life is fascinating (Fletcher seems to loosen up and ""flow"" much better in these sequences), the confusing descriptions of troop movements and battle sequences are vague. Many Civil War books suffer from this stilted language, often failing to convey in words what the movements on the battlefield actually looked like. I have always had a difficult time picturing the soldiers moving from place to place during battle, despite the author, perhaps the fault is mine, but Fletcher's writing certainly didn't help me overcome my confusion. He does a marginal job of describing the actual terror (perhaps he was fearless), and I found myself skipping whole sections of troop movement descriptions. But nevertheless I was entertained by his story. He is without question a forthright and honest soldier, not a professional writer, and his honesty and humor come through clearly, elevating his story above the level of many other Civil War narratives."
1,"Shocking, Ms. Jordan!","The three troubled heroines in this overlong novel go through relationship problems which are probably not unknown to many female readers. Alas, for about 500 of the 538 pages, the heroines suffer from near-constant shock. The verbally abusive husband misbehaves (every day), and the heroine is shocked (and trembles). There are misunderstandings, and the heroine is shocked. A chance encounter, and the heroine is shocked. Etc. etc. The word ""shock"" in all its grammatical permutations on average comes up at least once on every single page. Less than halfway through the book, I found myself no longer caring for the whimpy heroines and instead just sarcastically anticipated when the next ""shock"" would come along. I'd say give this one a miss!"
2,too fast,"music box plays the song just fine, but the tempo is about twice as fast as it should be, makes the song kind of difficult to recognize if you dont know what it is beforehand. I suppose im being hard on it considering its just a cheaply made toy, but its just bothersome. If you want a quality music box try something else, possibly something a little pricier."
3,"Good concept, tedious story","I have been a huge fan of Harry Turtledove for around 6 years now. With the excpetion of How Few Remain, I have loved eveyone of his books. However, I am starting to get the feeling that Turtledove is getting bored with the HFR/Great War story line. I found myself skimming over large sections of the book where Turtledove repeated information that had been recounted numerous times already. For example: Sam Carsten's sun burn problems. Turtledove spent a large portion of the book simply catching readers up with information most of his readers already know about the characters. Still, I have high hopes for the Settling Accounts stories. Hopefully the start of the new series wil reenergize this rather tired story line. Turtledove's writing seems to flourish when he's writing about war. In peace, he tends to resort to repetion and melodrama."
5,American Empire: VIctorious Opposition,"This is long awaited book does not disappoint. Concluding the American Empire series started in Blood and Iron. Mr. Trutledove ends the lives of many main characters such as Sylvia Enos,Mrs.Moss, Nellie Semproches and others. However he does this in a fine fashion making they're deaths seem in the right place and replacing them with characters that compare but also differ. He also sets the stage for WWII and builds the suspense to the boiling point until in the last tantalizing paragraphs the second World War, the one that Turtledove has been marching towards during hte entire series explodes. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who has read the series and cannot wait for the next series, Return Engagement."
4,"An excellent read,however...","Another chapter of an ongoing saga of Americana of what-ifs and what-thens. If only Harry were to lay off on the gratuitous sex scenes,this would be an absolute 5-star novel.The action is well done and even in the lulls between,there is never a dull moment.Read all his Great War/American Empire novels and you will never regret doing so...."
4,Good story,"This was a good one. It seems to be real Turtledove, not some boiler room typing team just batting stuff out."
2,Nietzsche Misunderstood,"I can't believe Nietzsche deserves this type of attack. G.E. Gorfu appears to have misunderstood him totally. I have read several of Nietzsche's books but have never seen this side of Nietzsche. Is it Gorfu or I that need to read Nietzsche again? I wonder... Nietzsche was misunderstood all his life. I am not surprised if Gorfu too, has misunderstood him. The book may be well written, but what is the purpose? Why try to destroy this great icon of philosophy? Let people read Nietzsche and make up their own conclusions? Why do we need to see Nietzsche through the heavily tinted glasses of G.E. Gorfu?"
3,Not Bad,"Quality is OK. Don't expect these to be like American Optics or Ray Bans, you get what you pay for. They look nice and stylish. I like sunglasses with straight earpieces so these were good. Come with nice protective case I got the Chrome/Mirror and they are pretty nice."
4,OK forprice,I got the silver and the gold. They are not Randolph Engineering but serviceable. I got them for travel and lose the often
3,Decent Product,The glasses were rather sturdy and still are. The only issues I have is the nose pieces seem a little loose and the arms sort of bugle/arch out a tad bit. I wish it stated that in the description.
2,Not even close to MI,"Ok these aren't remotely close to my AO's. I mean for a 10 dollar pair they're not bad, but not quite what I was looking for."
4,Text Book Order,Product was delivered on time and in the condition as described in the outline on Amazon.com. I am very satisfied with this provider.Byron M...
3,Acceptable,"Product was definitely used, as I expected. The pages were all intact and readable. No writing or smudges."
4,Not bad for a textbook!,"I like how the author has broken down the different chapters. As with most textbooks there are a few areas that sort of drag on, especially the intro chapters, but mostly due to them giving you a background and history of Child Development. As you start breaking into the other chapters the information gets much more interested and it starts to read faster. I had to get this book for a class I was taking, but I found the information also useful in my personal life. All in all, not bad for a textbook!"
3,whatever,"this book was so boring idk i didnt do well in the class cuz i really didnt care, i think i sold the book shortly after it arrived"
5,Incredible book!,This book is just the perfect tool for teachers and parents to introduce their children to courtroom basics. It is engaging and entertaining. Bravo. There is nothing else like it out there that I could find that is comparable. Get this book. You will not be disappointed!
3,"Great for parents, not so great for teachers.","This book seems like it would be great for a parent. However, I bought it with hopes of learning some tips to teach my students. Most of the tips were geared for parents to implement at home or for a child's move from/to school. While there were a few things I can shift for use in the classroom, this will mostly become a resource for my students' parents."
4,Organization really does help,This book is very well written and was recommended to us by the developmental medicine physician my son sees for his ADHD. I think it has a great deal to offer with alot of useful suggestions (especially how to set up a binder). We adopted alot of what she said and it did help my son (and also his sister without ADHD) but some of the ideas were over the top for a fifth grader. The child also has to see the value of organization because if he doesn't work on it and buy into it you will waste alot of time and money.
5,Life Saver!,"My boys, 14 and 12, have embraced the ideas and concepts of this book. For once, we are ALL looking forward to the upcoming school year!"
3,What about the disorganized parent?,"If you actually have time to sit down and read this book, you will probably discover there is nothing in it you didn't already know. The real problem is the overextended parent who doesn't have the time to be a good example of organizational skills.Well-written and informative."
3,"Not bad, but not very good either","The book is readable, and it has nice hints about physical space, surroundings, etc. Unfortunately it is a little too commonsense and basic - do we really need pictures of office supplies to show us what they are? I am a bit disappointed."
5,The standard,"Professor Olivelle is a great scholar - no doubt one of the most highly respected Sanskritists and prolific translators of our time. As such, it should be no surprise to find that his translation of the Upanisads is the best currently available, and will likely remain so for quite some time. The introduction to the text is extremely informative and helps place the works in their proper context. The text itself is quite meticulously translated - striking an agreeable balance of readability, scholarship and faithfulness to the original Sanskrit. A must for anyone interested in Hinduism."
1,stilted and biased,"This translation pays no attnetion to traditional Upanshadic scholarship in India, is totally Germanic (i.e., indological, colonialist), misrendering terms with a Christian or at least theistic bias, e.g., the Isha Upanishad, where Shankara's long commentary on the first verse is totally ignored."
4,Excellent one-volume resource,"This book is the first attempt to capture (in English) the nearly 1,300 years of papal coinage into a single volume. While such an undertaking cannot hope to be totally comprehensive (even multi-volume works find this task daunting), it has become, in the years since its publication, the #1 reference for papal coins. Listed all major types from the issues of Gregory III (731-741) to John Paul II (1978, up to about 1990), with special sections discussing monograms, denominations, heraldry, etc. All the major dealers use his numbering system.The only problems I can see is that there are numerous typographical errors which hopefully will be corrected if Berman comes out with a second edition, which to my mind at least, is long overdue!!!"
1,Awful!,"I bought this due to the decent reviews but very soon regretted it, these were so tight around my thighs! So tight it created an awful lumpy mess and massive panty line. I bought a medium which the sizing chart told me to buy, that was a lie.. Please save yourself the money and awful sights."
2,Uncomfortable & Rolls,"I got these thinking that I'd use them under my wedding dress. I wore them to one dress fitting and then tossed them out! As soon as I sat down or bent over the top of the pant rolled. Once it rolled, it made a large lump and indent in my torso. The idea was to get rid of lumps and bumps not to make a bigger one. The worst part is that this rolling and squeezing made me feel even pudgier than I already am!I ended up going to kohls and getting a body suit type of thing (looks like a leotard). It worked much better. There was no rolling or bunching with that!"
2,Would not order again,"I found these very uncomfortable and they made my middle look strangley rounded. Even under clothing they just made my shape look bizzare. I am a size 16 and expected these to flatten things, not round them."
1,Shrinkage,"Bought the same brand and style a few years ago. The material has changed and, when washed they shrunk 1 to 2 sizes. I had to discard them."
3,Bad sizing,"Looks like it does its job, but I find it runs very small according to the size chart. I will have to wait to wear this, but i'm keeping this product because it seems like it's wonderful quality. Size is my only complaint."
4,Its more like 4.5 stars,"Gary Barlow may have been initially the one touted to be ""The Next Big Thing"". But its Robbie Williams who now gets the label and he deserves it. Every one of the songs stands out making this album a pleasant one. ""Angels"" and ""She's The one"" are pretty ballads that are worth more than just a glance while ""Millenium"" and ""No Regrets"" displays a well-placed knowledge of Britich pop. Ricky Martin may have been the breakthrough of the American market but its really Robbie who has the talent to go all the way. And if he gets the exposure that he really deserves in the U.S, he'll be bigger than Ricky Martin and the Backstreet Boys in no time."
2,Was I in a merciful mood tonight?,"Maybe. I heard ""Millenium"" in a Burger King last Tuesday, and it drove me to depression for awhile. I went on a personal crusade to find out who did that song, and I almost took it out on the Backstreet Boys(Sorry Guys). I finally tracked it down here, and I started having daggers in my eyes ""KILL KILL"". However, there is a rather decent sound to this except for ""Millenium"" of course. However, it's not enough to make me go out and buy this. I will say though that I will hopefully download ""Old Before I Die"" off Napster someday as that is my favorite song off here. Maybe ""One Of God's Better People"" too, but a definite maybe. Well now that I found the culprit who did one of the songs that can make me helpless as a kitten, and sampled more of his music I can let go of this now as I have had my say, and that is: The Ego Has Landed in the water, and has drowned. Wait for this to go on sale for .99 cents."
1,1 star. I would have given him none but it won't do that.,I come from the same place as Robbie does and I think he is shameful to us. Of all the people to become famous it had to be him. Everybody in England has heard of him and his songs and I wish we didn't. Americans if u like him so much u can keep him and his songs.
5,"robbie, my love","Robbie is probably the most carismatic pop singer all over the world. He is so beatufil, and he is a nice person too. I am from argentina and i am very cheerful because last month, robbie came to our country and he gave us the oportunitty to knew him better and his show was really fantastic. In conclusion, i love you robbie."
5,A CD Worth Listening To,"I got this CD because of one song ""Angels"" and it's not even my favorite after listening to the entire thing. My new favorite is ""One of God's Better People,"" but I adore almost every single track on there. The lyrics are fun and catchy, an example being 'Strong's': ""Early morning when I wake up, I look like Kiss but without the makeup."" Also good is ""No Regrets"", ""Win Some Lose Some"" and the remake of ""She's The One"", but then all the songs are great and there is probably a song to fit your every mood."
1,Snobbie Williams - a no talent.,"I only rated this 1 star because you have to. It deserves nothing. This guy is disappointing to put it very nicely. The title of this album is the most hypocritical statement I've ever read. If you have ever listened to this guy talk ,you'll realize that his ego will NEVER land. His song are fabricated by some group of inside writers, no different than America's N'Sync or Britney Spears. And with an ""I'm-out-of-breath"" voice like that it is a sheer wonder how anyone gave him a chance anyway. You haven't heard a good singer until you listen to people like Michael Hutchence, Freddie Mercury, or Bono. Take my advice, he's so pompous and egotistical, you'll even get insulted just listening to his songs! Save your money Please."
4,Pop music at its best,"I will be honest, I am not really into pop music of this type. However, the lyrics are realistically blunt with some interesting melodies. For exapmle, you have probably heard ""Millenium"" with a sample of Nancy Sinatra's ""You only live twice"" from the James Bond movie of the same name. ""Jesus in a camper van"" is a catchy tune. ""Let me entertain you"", ... did he manipulate a line of Nirvana's fame?? Well i think this is one of the better cd's i bought in 1999. And because i think most new music is awful, that says a lot. I encourage you to get this cd even if you only know and love a few songs. You are sure to like the rest."
4,ROBBIE WILLIAMS IS GOOD!!!,"ROBBIE'S DEBUT U.S. ALBUM SHOWS HOW HE IS SO FAMOUS OVERSEAS.THE 1ST SINGLE ""MILLENIUM"" IS GREAT.BUT I REALLY LOVE THE 2ND SINGLE ""ANGELS"" CUZ THE VIDEO IS GREAT .I ALSO LIKE ""LAZY DAYS"",AND ""SHE'S THE ONE""(THE 3RD SINGLE) IS WOULD PICK THIS CD UP."
2,"Derivative, Pointless, Commercial,... man from Stoke","Robbie Williams indeed has a huge ego. Considering his serious lack of musical talent it is difficult to know why he thinks his mediocre trash is indispensable listening for us all. The point is, who needs this filling the charts when there is so much genuine talent out there that needs some airplay. The production on this isn't bad, songs like 'Angels' are decent... but most is UNentertaining drivel. Please refrain from buying this record and getting him the superstardom in America that he is craving."
2,"Two stars for CD due to lyrics, otherwise five stars","My interest in Robbie Williams began after hearing MILLENNIUM on the radio. I searched for this song. I finally heard the name, Robbie Williams, mentioned and went to Amazon.com. I listened to the clips available to hear and ordered the CD.I was shocked when I listened to the entire CD. Robbie Williams has much talent as a singer, and the music is wonderful to the ear. JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN, is heretical. The first line of STRONG is truly distasteful. These two songs, in particular, are 180 degrees from MILLENNIUM and YOU'RE ONE OF GOD'S BETTER PEOPLE.The music and vocal talents earn a five star rating, The CD earns only two stars primarily based on the quality of the lyrics. Since I won't be listening to it anymore, I truly wish I could get a refund"
5,I can't wait for the ego to land!,"To the inhabitants of the US, Robbie Williams is not yet a household name--but watch out! When he hits the states, you will all be wondering why the Ego didn't land sooner. This album is a combination of his other two, Life Thru a Lens and I've Been Expecting YOu, both of which are excellent. I'm sure this CD will be a big hit. Buy this CD and let Robbie entertain you!"
3,A good effort but let's not go overboard with praise,"Robbie is cool, Robbie is hip... It's fair to say he is flavour of the month, especially in the UK. But how long will his appeal last?? A nice debut effort for our American friends but why wasn't Robbie confident enough to release both solo albums as opposed to a 'greatest hits' album?"
5,An Awesome CD,"I bought this CD because I love the ""Millenium"" Song. After listening to the entire track, I thought every song was great, especially ""Angels"" Can't wait for the next CD."
2,"Music and vocals are great, the lyrics drag down the CD","My interest in Robbie Williams began after hearing MILLENNIUM on the radio. It took me some time to finally discover who the artist was. I found out and went to Amazon.Com. I listened to the available clips and ordered the CD.I was shocked when I listened to the entire CD. Robbie Williams is an extremely talented singer and the music is wonderful to the ear. JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN is heretical. The first line of STRONG is truly distasteful. These two songs, in particular, are 180 degrees from MILLENNIUM and YOU'RE ON OF GOD'S BETTER PEOPLE. Due to lyric content I only can listen to six songs on this CD.The music and vocal talents earn a five star rating. Sorry the lyrics lower the rating to only two stars. The hidden track is very sophmoric and below a talented artist as this.Just for the record I have written email to the Robbie's Management without response."
1,Junk.,"It's a good thing that butt-ugly British import Robbie William's popularity seems to be taking an expected nose-dive. And I guess that's not saying much, considering the fact that he didn't seem to be making much of an impact to begin with. I hope Robbie Williams ends his days very soon at the end of a sewage duct pile-up."
4,Cool cd,"I thought this cd was really good, except for the fact that he copied Oasis, the Beatles, and, apparently, Elton John. My favorite songs are Millenium, Win Some, Lose Some, and Angels. I really liked this cd."
2,Gotta say this...,"I really like Robbie's style, he's a kool and sympathic guy. i also like his videoclips because they are somtimes so outrageous and therefore kinda brave, I like it! But still: This man just can't sing! I really think his voice is an unpleasant tone which makes u wanna turn off the radio and watch the videoclips without tone. I mean Robbie is a good entertainer and a kool gyu but his voice is a tragedy."
5,Robbie Rules,"Quite simply you must listen to this CD. It's soft. It's hard. It's loud. It's easy listening. It's everything. Robbie shows just how versatile he is and often bares his soul in doing so. Clever lyrics and great catchy tunes. Lets hope for more of the same from this most individual of artists. All tracks tell a story and my favourites are the raunchy ""Man Machine"" and the beautifully anthemic ""She's The One"". ENJOY."
5,It's a Brill cd,"The Ego Has Landed it the most brilliant cd of the year. I've been a fan of Robbie for many years now and I have both cds that was put together to make this cd. These songs are the best of the bunch. They are top notch. The poppy-ness on the album is seen through such songs as Millennium, strong, and Jesus in a Camper Van. This is also filled with many ballads such as Angels, Killing Me, and She's the One. The Ego Has Landed takes all types of music such as rock, pop, ballad, etc and when put together you get this amazing cd. It is for anyone and everyone because you are bound to find at least one song you love on this cd. I think Robbie said it best himself when he said, ""This is a concept album, the concept being it's great."""
5,Watch out America .... here comes Robbie!,All I can say is it's about time that Robbie's record company decided to share his music with the US. We've had the privilege of listening to Robbie for the past few years since he split from Take That and the fact that he managed to break away from that TeenBoyBand image and gain the respect of proper music lovers is phenomenal. His performance at Glastonbury last year was voted as the best - outing the indie groups who regularly take the top slot. This is a cd that has to be listened to LOUD. I guess it's a pity that he's such a cocky little sod. :o)
4,Outstanding,"I first heard Robbie Williams last Fall while I was in England, where he is inescapable. I'm not much of a fan of pop music... okay, I usually hate pop music but Robbie Williams is my one exception. The hooks in this album are amazing and you just can't stop singing along to it, even after the CD is long over. In my opinion, Robbie Williams is the thinking man's pop star. Sure it's light and it isn't the most ground breaking stuff I've ever heard... but it's great fun and it doesn't insult your intelligence."
4,Good album,His voice is the combination of pet shop boys and oasis. All songs in this album are easy listening
4,No regrets,"It is unfortunate that Robbie Williams has not truly burst onto the American music scene. I found this album a refreshing break from the pomposity and fluff that is American pop music. I enjoyed the fact that instead of every song sounding like the next, each was unique in and of itself. Is this my favorite album? No...that place currently belongs to ""Sing When You're Winning"" Am I glad I bought the album? Yep, no regrets."
5,Robbie's best songs in one CD...,"I'm not a Robbie Williams fan, but I liked listening to many of his songs. This album had given them to me on one CD as a collection, instead of havin to buy 2 of his albums, or quite a few singles..."
4,Finally we see the consequences of boy bands!!!,"Take That was one of the worst groups to ever come out of merry ol' England, so when I saw Robbie Williams on David Letterman, I was understandably skeptical. His attitude, however, proved my fears groundless. Here was man who had become a teen idol and realized what a Hell it can be. ""The Ego has Landed"" is an exceptional narrative on this reality, as well as Williams' personal struggle with drug addiction and his own mortality. Some of the best lyric-writing since the eighties New Wave era, good beats, and one helluva voice. Oasis and Paul Weller had better watch out, because Robbie Williams is doing what they should have been doing along!!! Chris N."
5,Robbie Has Landed - Hurray for Him (& Those Who Hear Him!),"When I first moved from the US to the UK last summer, Robbie Williams' ""Millenium"" was just being released here - and what a tremendous way to be greeted into my new home! I was so smitten with the man and his music I sent CD singles of that song to all my family and friends back home in the US. I'm so thrilled he's finally made it over there himself, and I can't recommend the new US-released CD highly enough. It's the best of his 2 UK albums, and I'm going to buy it so I can hear all my favourites without having to change CDs!"
5,WOW!,"I picked up this CD after hearing Jessica Simpson's cover of 'Angels'. Having heard the powerful lyrics from Simpson's version, I was intrigued. After 2 listens, I know that this is one of the best pop albums I've ever heard. It's diverse, eccletic, and catchy. I have not found a weak track. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do!"
5,"Come on, America!",Buy this album! You'll love it! There are at least nine great pop songs on this one record. Who could ask for more?
4,"I hate to say it, but really enjoyable","I hate to say this, but I really like this album. I enjoyed ""Millennium"" when it was released and I thought about buying it, but now that ""Angels"" has been released as a single I had to buy it. At first I kind of expected the boy band junk that originally brought Robbie into the public eye, but was suprised to find everything from Oasis type alterna/rock to great pop songs. All in all a really good record."
5,This CD is truly a work of pure genius!,"Robbie Williams has managed to bring together the best of two huge CD's and give us a taste of who he is. From the beautiful song Angels to the hip shaking sound of Let Me Entertain You to the Bond feel of Millenium, Robbie has truly shown the world that if you believe in yourself you can rise above the boy band image and create amazing adult flavored music. The music and lyrics on this CD can never be matched."
5,Awesome cd!!,This is one of the few cds that I can listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs.
5,Robbie puts the KING in Kingdom!,"The United Kingdom, that word should stir all Robbie fans as the Brits have done it again. Although Robbie is no John Lennon he has an extraordinary talent that deserves to wing its way across the pond. Forget the publicity and hype and buy the CD. It is great!"
5,Man of the Millenium!,"From Lazy Days to the strikingly hostile poem, Robbie Williams has it all covered. He touches on the reality of life, but somehow manages to allow a peace of attainable Utopia to emerge from his songs. I believe that Williams is way before his time, explaining why his amazing talent has not been taken note of, by the majority of the new age music listeners that stand before him today. This is a must-have for anyone with the ability to hear!"
5,"Mega, mega, mega...","I hated Take That, and was thusly suspicious when ol' Robbo took to a solo career, but apparently the time he's spent with Oasis did him some good, or brought out some genius within. ""Millenium""...what can I say, except that it's still going to be issuing forth from my CD changer at said time. ""No Regrets""...brilliant, as is ""Lazy Days"". And ""Old Before I Die""? Wow, sort of sounded like Oasis' ""It's Getting Better Man!!"" the first time, but gets better and more distinctively individual upon subsequent listenings.Excellent compilation of material, and highly recommended, even to an American public that no longer seems mad for a British invasion. Perhaps this will change some minds."
4,A good read for conrad fans,"There's a lot of detail here about his life, too much, perhaps, but certainly among the great 20th century writers conrad led one of the more interesting lives. I was more interested in a study of his works, what inspired him to write stories like lord jim and the secret agent (incidentally victory, one of conrad's best, overlooked works does get this sort of detailed inspection - but it is the exception) but for the most part meyers speeds through these parts. But if you have an interest in conrad, have read a number of his stories and would like to know more, then I certainly recommend this biography."
2,Not good,"This churned-out biography tries to sensationalize Conrad by speculating an affair with Jane Anderson and speculating Conrad's dislike of the sea and speculating, and speculating, and speculating ...Don't waste your money. If you are interested in exploring Conrad's life, buy Najder's ""Joseph Conrad: A Life,"" the work of someone who has spent a whole life on Conrad and cares about getting his facts straight."
5,Great CD,Bought this for my mom for her birthday and we both love this CD. Great Southen Gospel Music! Love it!
5,Love my michael bowling cd,I had owned the cd once before and lost it. I weas so happy to find it on amazon.com. It definitely deserves a 5 star rating. Would highly recommend this cd to everyone. If this cd doesnt move you nothing will.
5,If everyone read this book....,"If everyone read this book and put into practice just a few of these suggestions, this world would be a much better place.Although written from the perspective of helping birds, many of these suggestions will help the world as a whole, one step at a time. As I read this book, I was surprised to learn the consequences of some of my actions that I had never even thought about. Now I'm thinking seriously about changing some of these seemingly innocuous behaviors since I know their big-picture impacts.While not purporting to have all the answers, Erickson has done an incredible amount of research and helps guide us to make responsible decisions on even the stickiest of issues.Anything but a dry read, and a book you won't soon forget."
1,waste of money,"Chapter 1, page 1 - 5 tells you to only drink organically grown coffee. So next time you go through McDonalds drive-thru be sure to ask the teenager waiting on you where the beans were grown. Page 5 - 10 tells you not to eat beef - something about habitat destruction. I agree caring for the environment helps all living things but really???"
2,Not for young Kids!,"Overall the book isn't worth reading.Also, I know the book was intended for middle-school aged girls, but you should read it before you pass it on to anyone.*Spoilers**Spoilers*In the book, there was the brutal death of an animal stomped on multiple times; the main character 'used' to be huge into drugs but now she only smokes joints every now and then; a pregnant girl in the house smokes cigarettes and asks for a joint - then proceeds to ask the main character if she has ever had an orgasm; and finally she ends up having 'passionate' sex with a guy she met the day before.Pretty hilarious, actually.The only part that was good was one brief interaction with the male unicorn."
3,short and sweet,"This book starts out as a run of the mill fiction book, until the drugs and the families ""secret"" is revealed then the plot is twisted into a modern day Noah with whimsical feats and futuristic tales in it. Basically it is a 60's version of Noah. I recommend this book it is short and you will get something out of it. For ages 14+."
4,Very durable and my son loves it!,"My toddler loves looking at pictures of our extended family and I think it has helped him become familiar with faces that he does not see that often. We have had our album about a year and it is very durable. The reason I only rated this as 4 stars is that it was hard to size pictures to the picture openings. Since the pages have all different shapes and sizes, faces did not display easily. But once it was put together, it has been a great product."
4,They Almost Made It,"""Scott of the Antarctic"" chronicles the attempts of Royal Navy Officer Robert Falcon Scott to lead the first expedition to the South Pole. Although somewhat dated, the film adroitly depicts human courage and frailties as Scott attempts to keep the men in his charge focused on the prize. The ending is not together unexpected but very poignant in the use of visual symbolism. John Mills and Kenneth More are excellent British actors more than capable of illustrating the mounting tensions and fear as the men finally acquiesce to their fate. Highly recommended."
3,Bit Disappointed,"I had seen it years ago and thought it was pretty good but after watch it again I was not very impressed. It is OK, but not enough drama or action."
3,Capable if leaden storytelling,"The Bottom Line:Scott of the Antarctic follows the facts of the doomed Terra Nova expedition rather faithfully (if dryly) but it fails to delve much into the character of Scott, depict the cruel twists of fate that lead to the deaths of the explorers, or convey the sense of despair and futility that accompanied their ultimate demise (they were only 11 miles from critical supplies and fuel); I can't really recommend the film because if you already know all the details you won't get anything out of the rest of the film and if you don't know the details you'd be better served reading a book about the expedition.2.5/4"
2,Best knife but RUSTS,"I would have given this 10 stars if it wasn't for one thing...it RUSTS. This knife is made in Japan, cuts paper thin vegetables and the short length is just perfect. After using it for the first time, I noticed the blade started rusting. I called the customer service to see what they have to say about this before I returned it. Apparently, this knife consists of three layers, the outer layer being stainless steel, middle layer being another type of steel, and the innermost layer being ""carbon steel"" which is the blade itself. The innermost layer is the only layer which rusted. According to the customer service, if the knife is not washed and dried immediately after every use, it will rust.If you have the patience to immediately wash and dry the knife after every use, rusting should not occur (so it is claimed). But I have the habit of washing my knife and let it hang dry in the knife storage. It is going back."
1,Disappointment,"The sound quality is average, the singers are 3 non descript individuals that have never seen Ireland nor have they any affinity whatsoever with this beautiful country. The filiming is below average. Most of all all the twigs from the christmas tree lie all along the floor, very untidy !"
4,Ok,"These were a good price and I am glad to have but, they are making my little plants really stretch to get the light and so compared to LED these are not good, but i think i will keep them around."
1,Bad Mismatch,"I have not bought this product here. I have bought the product named in the title elsewhere and found it beneficial and would happily give it at least four stars; it has nothing to do with vitamin K, which is all that is mentioned in the product description. I have no idea what someone would get if they ordered, nattokinase or vitamin K. (Don't really expect the review to stay -- just fix the problem!)"
5,Jersey,I purchased this item in the 4th quarter of the finals and I must admit that the quality is great. I am very pleased with this purchase. Go Mavs !!!
2,some neat facts... silly solutions,"While some of the facts are interesting, to this author it seems like solution to most of the world's problems are:The US should give a lot more moneyAfrican countries need to sign a lot of treaties.One of the silly facts:More people know the McDonald's arches than the Christian cross. The reason... Christians are not tolerant of gays.. Really?? I would think it is because the Majority of the Chinese and Indian belong to a different religions.It was a quick read, but I wouldn't look for any in depth research."
5,Blows you out of your shell - if you can distract yourself from Hollywood,"Well researched, thought-provoking and well-written.Unfortunatley, most people are more concerned with the latest TV programs / Hollywood stars to really give much hope.Turn in, turn off and drop-in? Please...."
1,letdown,"Valor and vengeance is kill and his voice/growl dominates. This cd is way over-produced and it is awful. Go spend your money on something good like Despised Icon ""the ills of modern man"" or just go get some old Sheer Terror. No cartwheeling allowed dorks."
4,"Cool, unique, but not indestructable","In my experience, these cars are unique, entertaining, and educational. My husband is as entranced with these as my 4 year old son. The mini sedan drives very smoothly and clips back together very well.Despite liking this toy a lot, I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5, because of problems with durability. The manufacturer claims that these cars are tough, made of solid wood and polycarbonate. However, within two weeks of receiving this car as a gift, my son handed me a torn tire. He now has a 3-wheeled car.While this is a great little toy and the manufacturer recommends it for ages 3 and up, I would personally recommend it only for kids 6 and up, who will treat their toys a little better. The body may be durable, but the tires are easily destroyed."
2,Not worth buying,"This was one of the very first router bits I purchased after I bought my router. I thought it would be cool to make my own crown molding. I've never been able to make anything usable with this bit. I made all sorts of jigs to try and hold the wood as I passed it over the bit, but the problem is the bit design. Now that I've bought and used other bits, I realize that this bit does not have a little roller spindle at the end to hold the wood from going too deeply into the bit. Almost all of my other its have this sort of thing. So, if you're excited about making your own molding with this thing, maybe you better think a little more about it."
2,great acting. slow plot - needlessly sad all the way through.,"I love the actors in the film. However, the plot itself, aside from slow, was needlessly tragic throughout. Full of co-dependencies and relationships lacking any healthy semblance of love. Lots of manipulation and self-indulgence. The viewer is left with less of a sense of pity for the characters than a general sentiment of disdain."
2,Compatible?,"I am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices, however, with my Panasonic SV-SD80 MP3 player, this product was not compatible. I could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to SD Audio support."
2,Doesn't work with SD Audio,"As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio. Total waste of money."
2,slooooooooow,"This card is such a disappointment. It is soooo sloooooow. I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq. It takes forever to copy anything to and from it."
1,worst choice of my life,"Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?Now I can't use it at all....I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.Buyers beware...."
1,Disappointment...A total waste of time and money,"This book was a total disappointment. I was hoping to learn about the history of Islam and origins of the violence from some of the modern-day Muslims. Instead, I wasted my time wading through supposed ""history"" and ""facts"" to find that I was reading a biased, non-factual and emotional polemic. It is shocking what passes for scholarly and historic these days. Do not waste your time and money on this when there are many books on this subject that are worth the investment."
1,Very Disappointing,"From the preface forward, Schwartz spins a tale that would have the believer swallow the nonsense that Wahhabists are hijacking this peaceful religion called Islam (submission). He misses few opportunities to insult conservatives and even compares Christians who embrace the fundamentals of Christianity as similar to Wahhabism (p. 79). There must be some value to this work, but it is disheartening to wade through the muck contained in this book to find an occasional gem."
1,Misleading and mendacious,"The author's suggestion that pre-Wahhabist Islam had been peaceful, and the Ottoman Empire tolerant, is a fallacy better understood in the context of his own conversion to Islam. Mr. Schwartz is known among his co-religionists as Suleyman Ahmad and has an eccentic entry on >jews-for-allah.org< about his relgious experience. This is essential information about the author and his agenda. It is unfortunate that it is missing from the blurb or from the book itself."
3,Main Points Are Well Taken,"The main thesis of this book, that the Saudi elite seem to be our friends on the surface while encouraging fundamentalist extremism behind the scenes, should be very clear to everyone with a brain by now. Schwartz shows plenty of evidence of how the Saudis and Wahhabism effectively have been deceiving the west with some very frightening results around the world. That's the main message of the book and it's right on target.Other parts of it are a lot harder to swallow. He seems to think Iran is pretty harmless, which seems ridiculous given the latest elections and the nuclear bid. Without giving any evidence, he asserts that Bush really wants to start putting the pressure on the Saudis and do the right thing while it's Cheney that's really to blame for the continued whitewashing by our government of the Saudi role in terrorism. Last I checked, Dubya's still president and he's to blame if steps aren't being taken to really alter our relationship with the Saudis."
2,pictured wrong,"The product photo display depicts 2 ea. tube, an o-ring and a pressure coupler. Package had only 1 ea. tube in package. Pictures by sellers can be deceiving."
2,"Not the original, that's for sure","The flavor of this gum is clove, but it's not nearly as good as the original, or other ""knockoffs"". The white stick is not as soft as it should be, and the flavor goes away very quickly. I was extremely disappointed, I've bought this from other makers and it had a much stronger flavor. In other words, this is a cheap imitation and the company that makes it must making LOTS of money off of it. Don't buy it, you will be disappointed."
5,Some things never change!,I have a lot of childhood memories that included CLOVE GUM. It was always a favorite of my Mom and considered a real treat! My Mom recently celebrated her 91st birthday. I found several nostalgic surprises for her on Amazon including GLOVE GUM. She was thrilled. Some things never change.
1,Clove Gum - The wrapper taste lasts longer - wast of money,The gum was hard (very old) The flavor lasted less than 2 minutes - no exaggeration. This product is a waste of money. Dentyne is far superior not to mention so many long lasting refreshing flavors out there today. Maybe that's why this one is not carried by your local drug store or supermarket - nobody would buy it a second time.
5,Gum from the Past!,"This is an excellent gum for smokers, drinkers, and for folks who like to eat spicy and smelly foods. It really gives your mouth a clean and fresh scent of cloves. It's a gum from the past that gives your mouth a blast of freshness."
5,expensive but you get what you pay for,this gum is really good and tastes great. it was a little expensive but it was worth the money I have quit smoking and I am totally satisfied with having it at my convenience.
1,Gum is old and stale,First I have to say that I love this gum. With that being said I was extremely disappointed when I received my order. This gum was old and stale and when I unwrapped the gum it crumbled into a dozen pieces.
1,BAD,"Do not purchase this item! Gum was over priced,brittle,stale and old. Do not waste your money. This was for a nostalgia gift and I had to keep it, otherwise it would have been returned."
1,Stale,"Gum arrived with good packaging, sealed in plastic.The gum its self however is stale and crunchy. looses flavour quickly.Don't bother."
4,great idea,"The mat was very wrinkled from being folded, but I did press it out with a steam iron. Otherwise works well and is a good size. Had one before which didn't have the inflatable tube and it did not work well-too hard to roll without puzzle separating."
2,"Great idea, but a pain to use","The idea of this item is fantastic - but the way it's sold and designed makes me hate it. The mat comes folded, so there are creases that keep puzzle pieces from lying flat. Also, the felt makes it impossible to slide a piece into position. If there was a way to make the pieces more movable, it would make using this much easier. (I know the mat needs to be a bit ""sticky,"" since it's designed for keeping the puzzle intact, but still, when not moving a puzzle from place to place, this makes for a very annoying ""feature."")Until this is repackaged so it's sold rolled (uncreased), I WOULD NOT advise anyone to purchase it."
1,DISAPPOINTED,DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS PRODUCT - INCLUDED AN INFLATABLE ITEM WITH KEEPS PUZZLEIN TACT AS IT IS WRAPPED UP. TO ME IT WAS FLIMSY AND NOT WORTYH THE PRICE.
1,Not what I expected,I don't think I will ever use this! As soon as I opened it I knew it was not what I wanted. I put it in a drawer! It would be very annoying to do a puzzle on since the pieces dont slide around. Puzzles have dust in them so you could never just dump a puzzle on the mat. I have no idea if it is any good for storing a puzzle because it is no good for doing a puzzle on!
1,not good in household with pets,"I loved the idea of being able to roll up my puzzle, and I did so with this quite alot. Then one of our cats got to it, put a hole in it, and it never worked again.Then I bought one made of simple round cardboard tubes and voila! No more leaking air from my puzzles and the whole thing getting messed up. The only thing I regret now, is not making those tubes myself."
1,Completely worthless,"I must say that this is truly unbelievable. I cannot believe that anyone would create a puzzle mat that sticks rather than slides. ANYONE who has EVER worked on a puzzle knows that one must slide the pieces at times (quite often, actually). I cannot stress enough that whoever designed this is simply inept. No one in his or her right mind would create this, much less market it. I am angry that I was duped into buying this terrible piece of cloth labeled ""puzzle mat.""In addition, the entire set (mat and container) is extremely poor quality.I would recommend burning it, not buying it."
1,not easy to use,"I would not recommend it! It is huge, not user friendly having to blow up the interior tube to roll up the puzzle"
1,Useless,"I agree with other reviewers, folds in the felt never straighten out. The felt make it impossible to adjust the alignment of pieces without them pulling apart. I bought a large piece of foam core instead...it doesn't roll up but I can move it off the table and serve dinner! A similar product made with a smooth plastic or silicone would be better for those who need to roll it up thier puzzles."
2,"Too big, puzzle pieces still escaped","whomp whomp, I was looking for something to protect my puzzle, all I got was misc pieces coming out the sides of the felt as the tube slightly deflated over time. It's also really awkward to store because it can't be placed on it's end and it's a pretty wide tube. Seemed like a great solution, but in practice it didn't work out so well for me."
4,Works well,This works really well for putting the puzzle away untill you can work on it again. its hard to slide the pieces around on the mat so i didnt like putting the puzzle together on it.
3,A good idea with some flaws,"The idea of storing a puzzle in progress is very appealing, but this mat has so many creases in it, that it made it very difficult to keep the puzzle flat while we were working on it.The rolling-up part was not too difficult, and it unrolled nicely with the puzzle still intact.I would prefer if it came with 3 bands instead of 2 so that it was more secure when rolled up.The color of the mat is supposed to be a bright color so it makes it easier to see the peices, however the mat that I got is black.It's also made of felt, so if you have pets, it will collect some hair.I am going to attempt to iron the mat before using it again to see if this will help smooth it out."
2,Does not lie flat,"This came out of the box all folded up, so it had many large creases in it. Even after trying to press out the creases it will not lie flat, so my jigsaw is coming apart because the mat is so uneven. Not really happy with this product."
4,Not bad at all!,"I was a little nervous buying this item after all the folks who said they had problems with it. I took a chance and am quite satisfied. The mat I got is yellow felt, and looks just like the picture. It wasn't too creased - just where it had been neatly folded to fit in the box - and those creases came right out with a bit of ironing. It was a good risk and yes, probably a few dollars more than if I made my own as others suggest, but man was this easy! :)"
1,Waste of money...DO NOT BUY!,"Trust me when I say this is not worth a dollar, nevermind ten. I wish I had read the review before buying this piece of garbage. It consists of a square piece of felt that will not lie flat (kind of necessary when doing a puzzle), a blow up tube that is sure to pop and 2 ties that a bound to get lost. What a waste of money and a disappointment because it sounded like a great idea. Completely flawed. Someone else should create a better design..."
3,Puzzled,This item is great for a group project that can only be worked on at certain times. A darker color would be a better choice. The yellow shows too much dirt.
3,It's functional,"You definitely have to iron it before you start using it, but that's not a big deal. I found that is easy-to-use and I like the contrasted yellow against the puzzle pieces. Now my wife's not mad when I use the coffee table in the living room to do a puzzle."
1,Junk,I thought I was getting something of value. This is a piece of junk. It consists of a cheap piece of felt and a balloon to roll it up on with 2 velcro straps. What a rip off!
2,Not what I expected,I had expected a surface that would be suitable for doing puzzles on. This was just a large piece of felt and very bumpy surface. I don't see how anyone could do a puzzle on this surface. I just requested to send this product back because it did not meet my expectations.
3,"this is ok, not too thrilled","The rolling feature has an inflatable piece that goes in the middle. It's an ok product, but I wish I'd gotten something that stays flat."
3,Disappointed with the Quality,I have to say I'm disappointed with the quality of this product. For $15 I expected something more professional and durable. It's simply a piece of felt and a blow-up cylindrical tube. The fasteners aren't even attached to the felt. I suppose it fulfills the function but it's not the brilliant longer-term solution I was hoping for.
4,"Good Product, Functional and Sturdy","I am really happy with this product and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It's basically a large, heavy weight piece of felt that rolls around an inflatable tube and keeps your puzzles in place to work on at your convienence. It is a nice weight of fabric that seems like it would last quite a while and the inflatable tube holds air well. It does have folding creases right out of the box, but that was easily remedied by throwing it in the dryer with a wet hand towel for a short time. When removed from the dryer, the creases were absolutely gone and we proceeded to puzzle away. The only improvement I would make is to add an extra strap for the middle of the rolled puzzle, but other than that it is a product I would recommend."
4,It works.,"This is not rocket science, here, it's pretty basic: a felt cloth on which to work a jigsaw puzzle, an inflatable tube to aid in rolling the puzzle up, and some elastic straps to keep it tightly closed. I am not really sure that anyone can make anything better than this because, you are in fact rolling-up hundreds or thousands of cardboard pieces, and it's hard to get perfection when rolling something like that up. It does the job for the most part; just be prepared to have to re-do some of the puzzle when you un-roll it later, but that's a jigsaw puzzle for you, and you don't mind too much because you like doing puzzles anyway, or you wouldn't be doing a jigsaw puzzle in the first place. This product has been well thought-out, and I think it's much better to use it than to leave the puzzle out, hogging my dining room table in-between puzzling sessions."
4,perfect for short term storage,"Incredibly helpful for moving puzzles out of the way when you need the table or desk for another purpose before you can finish the puzzle. Pieces don't slip on the felt, so easy to roll up. Though not great for longer term storage (if you want to save the completed puzzle) since the inflatable tube deflates. Also, it works better with puzzles that have smaller pieces, they can wrap around the tube easier. Also, the felt does not sit flat when it's first unfolded out of the packaging- but it settles after some use, so it didn't bother me. Definitely recommend if for short term storage!"
3,puzzle wrapup,"This is a great idea for moving jigsaw puzzles around when you need the table. Unfortunately, the blow up tube had holes in it, and therefore made it unusable. The company is supposed to be replacing it, but so far we have not seen it. It has been two months."
1,"Falsely described, very poor value","1. The product is falsely described: ""bright felt mat with special non-skid backing"": it does not have a non-skid backing and is very slippery.2. The product came folded, in a box, with very sharp creases so it would not lie flat on a table without ironing.3. The product is grossly overpriced: buy a piece of felt at a fabric store for a fraction of the price and cut it to the size you prefer.Ravensburger Stow & Go - Puzzle Accessories"
4,stow away puzzle,Bought this for me Nephew he reallyliked it and said he will get much use out of it. he also can store iy & finish at a later date which he also liked
4,Good Item,"I did not realize the tube was inflatable, but it still works.It makes the item a little more versatile."
1,A joke,This didn't work. The plastic blow up loses air quickly. The puzzle started falling out of it. Dont waste your money on it.
4,Does the Job,"This product does what is expected. It rolls up and stores a completed puzzle. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because is it tough to work on the felt base. When building the puzzle, the pieces don't slide around so that you can connect them to other parts of the puzzle. Just a suggestion, but before you start a new puzzle, take out the yellow felt, open it up and iron it flat. It comes in the box folded, and the folds at the creases make it difficult to keep the puzzle flat. I know there really isn't another way to pack it, so ironing it first will save you a headache later."
4,Stow and Go is a good value and delivers portability,This product does just what we wanted: inexpensive and will make it possible to move puzzles from the dining room table so we can eat! Less likely to lose pieces as well.
3,Convenient Puzzle Storage,"I had never used a puzzle storage device before this one. I really needed a way of getting partially completed puzzles off the kitchen table without losing all the work I had done on the puzzles. This puzzle accessory consists of a bright yellow felt mat, an inflatable tube, and two elastic bands. You must inflate the tube by mouth unless you have a pump; this procedure is quick and easy if not sanitary. You lay the mat out and work the puzzle on it. When you get ready to put the partially completed puzzle away, you put the inflated tube on one end of the mat, roll it up and secure it with the two bands. When you unroll it, some of the puzzle will break apart, but you can reassemble it fairly easily. Some puzzles with parts that interlock well may not fall apart at all, but the one I am working on has some pieces that do not interlock at all and other pieces that interlock with a loose fit. In other words, the problem may be the puzzle, not the accessory."
2,"Good idea, packaging could be better","The Stow & Go should be a God-send for puzzle addicts like my daughter (for whom I bought it) but it turns out that it causes more problems than it solves. The yellow felt mat included arrives with some pretty heavy-duty creases which take FOREVER to settle down. The uneven surface makes for an extra challenge for puzzles with lots of pieces. It would have been much better if the product was sent in a tube, with the mat rolled rather than folded in on itself, that way it would be playable right out of the box."
3,For puzzle lovers,"This was a gift to my mom; she loves to do puzzles. Unfortunately, she has a cat who loves to play with puzzles too. She always had to put books on top of it so the cat wouldn't move the pieces. This gift seemed like a good thing for her. Only problem is: she likes the really big puzzles and this doesn't work for all of hers. Overall; a good gift."
5,A wonderful book that touched my heart!,"This is a wonderful story about a woman's efforts to bring comfort, understanding and love to her mother and father as they both cope with cancer and dying. Although potential readers might perceive the subject to be depressing, this book is not a downer, but rather a compansionate look at how to create a sacred and fulfilling event for both parents and children as they face living with a life threating disease. I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in spiritual growth and self discovery."
4,Excellent,"I live in Chucks hometown and have met him on occassion. Having lived in the artic for many years, and worked in the stock market arena, doing private placements many times, few people know what it has really taken for this man to accomplish what he did especially in the diamond industry. No overnight success many years in the making, hard work ingenious thought. It takes a special person to do it. Call him eccentric if you will, Hats off to him, great read, as adventourous and different as the prospector himself. And NO I am not a friend of his at all, met him twice. If you have the chance to meet him personally maybe you can listen to a personal snippet of what the backbone of the Canadian mining industry is all about, borrowed cups of coffee meals on tabs in local restaurants, long nights in cold dark places, plain hard work, which sometimes doesn't get rewarded, and this time did.Super good read, and tells it like it is."
3,Not completely authentic!,"Living, and having been in several of the countries and places described in the book, I could not help thinking that Charles Fipke could well have been there, but the author had not. It also seemed more about CF than the discovery of Etaki and all that went before that."
5,A Must For Camping,"We took the Graco Infant Car Seat Netting on a 3,000 mile road/camping trip with our five-week-old daughter and it was one of the most essential gear items we brought. The netting kept mosquitoes and deer flies off our baby's delicate skin while she snoozed next to the Salmon and Blackfoot Rivers of the Northern Rockies. The trip would have been a nightmare without it! Instead, we had a super relaxing trip and enjoyed a special time in the out-of-doors as a new family."
1,Poor glasses,"Very bad quality!!! ,!!! Bien malo no es buen production no lo recommends , the glasses are bad quality,,,,,nada q ver con unos espejuelos para pilotos no Los compren"
4,Great price,As one review stated the channel changing is a little slow if you're just channel surfing but other wise the picture is great and the dvd player will also play cds. I mounted ours on the master bedroom wall because I wanted to remove a 19in tv and stand that we kept our dvd and cd players in and it gave us more floor space by doing so. If you want more sound to knock you out of your chair or bed I suggest getting some speakers to add on. We are really pleased with our purchase. Also be aware of cost for wall mounts. They can be pricey.
4,Good,"Have been using it for 1 month, good product overall, good picture quality, good sound, price is fair and DVD player is a great feature. Only complain is that produces excessive heat at the back."
1,Stopped working within 6 months,"We had high hopes for this combination TV/DVD player and it gets very light use in my daughter's room. Unfortunately, it has had problems over the past 3 months, not turning on at all, and after several weeks of ""sometimes"" working, it no longer powers on at all.Save your money and buy a Sharp or Sony."
1,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!","As the previous two reviewers said, this remastered version is utter garbage; Dan Hersch of Digiprep (credited with remastering) has destroyed the second half of ""The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion"". (It's possible, I suppose, that someone else was responsible for the screw-up.)The first CD (""The Incredible String Band"") is fine, and the first few tracks of ""The 5000 Spirits..."" sound decent. But starting with track 7 (""Blues for the Muse""), the channels are all out of sync and the music is ruined.By all means buy this music - it's great stuff. But avoid this particular edition like the plague."
5,Freestyler,"Freestyler has come in with a major explosion and is proberly one of the best mixes for 2000! This is one of the best singles that I've ever bought, although there are only 5 tracks on the CD it is definately worth the money!"
4,Cellex-C Works,"I have been using Cellex-C since January 2010 and have seen a noticeable reduction of under eye dark circles and puffiness. If you're looking for a product that erases all traces of dark circles and under eye puffiness, you will likely have to consult a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. However if you are interested in a noticeable reduction of dark circles and puffiness, I recommend Cellex-C. Initially, I thought that it was expensive, however, I still have half of a bottle left. I used it 1 to 2 times a day and have been more consistently using it twice a day for months."
4,Great eye gel,It is always hard to tell with eye creams/gels but I swear I can see less puffiness almost immediately. I use it all the time. It has a cool tingling feel which is invigorating as well.
4,"Works, but stings a bit","Works well on puffiness, but so mentholated it makes your eyes water. Only for serious puffiness."
1,"Literally no effect on me after weeks of use, avoid!","I've suffered with dark circles under my eyes for a LONG time. I have basically every factor that can go into dark circles: hereditary, horrible allergies, high blood pressure, etc. So I've been looking for something, anything that can help alleviate that problem.This product is not that thing. I saw literally no change after faithful use for weeks. Still dark as ever. Still puffy as well. It only managed in annoying me with getting my dark circles all moist. Nice smell though!Avoid this product."
1,sad eyes get more sad,"I have been using about two weeks. Directions are poor, doesn't say how much to use or how often. My wife says my eyes look worse, more puffy, but I can't tell one way or the other since it was her idea to buy this because I never really paid much attention or cared. I'll keep using it until it's gone. Who knows maybe a miracle will happen by the time I get to the end of the bottle, but I sort of doubt this.An interesting aside...a friend told me he has been using Preparation H for years to reduce the puffiness under his eyes and he swears by it. I'm not making this up..."
5,Helpful info,I am very excited about becoming self-sufficient in feeding my family of six. This book has extremely helpful ideas that are very cost effective. Highly recommend this book.
3,A little disappointed,The book is very helpful when it comes to thinking about winter gardening but I think the average person will not have access to a huge portable greenhouse to accomplish this.
5,Four-Season Harvest: Organic Vegetables from Your Home Garden All Year Long,Eliot Coleman has combined how-to text with drawings that inform and inspire. Highly recommended reading!
3,It's not for the southern gardener,"I couldn't relate to most of it, being from Florida. I had hoped for more general info on greenhouses, how to choose one etc..It is probably a good book for northern gardeners"
4,Great book with great ideas!,"This is not as good a natural farming and no till, but there are a LOT of GREAT idea in this book for growing all year. I have found that I can grow more food over winter than the rest of the year because there are few pest! Thank you for writing this market garden book!"
1,The author is too self involved - not enough real info,"After seeing the book here on Amazon I thought I wanted it. While looking for another book at the local library I found this book in it's revised and updated edition. I was sadly disappointed. It is more a travellog than a how-to on gardening. I read several other similar books and the best one I found was ""Solar Gardening"" by Leandre Poisson from Chelsea Green."
5,Every Gardener should read... changed my philosophy about life!,"Beyond just food, this book even shook my foundation by practical real knowledge of living. It exposes so much of the bias of ""common sense"".A must for any gardener... and could open many other eyes as well!"
4,Surprising but true,"If gardening can be done in maine it can be done anywhere. This author is well known in organic circle from earlier works, but through his continuing research it is now a mature science and well worth adding it to your gardening library."
5,Awsome service,"This company was awsome to deal with. I ordered books last year from Amazon through a different dealer, and waited five weeks for my books to arrive at my home. With this company eventhough I didn't pay for the extra fast shipping the books were at my home in less than a week! Additionally the company sent me a prompt email to make sure that my order was satisfactory. I would order from them again in a heartbeat and encourage others to do so with complete confidence."
5,Perfect gardening read,"This is a wonderful read and resource for the veggie gardener of any variety (that experiences a winter). Very easily paced, lots of great information, and truly appeals to a gardener such as me who wants to work WITH nature and not push it with machine-processed fertilizers, antibiotics, etc. I also have his Winter Harvest book of which I whole-heartedly intend to read next."
5,we love it!,it is so nice to have an all year gardening book that actually works in the state of maine! Makes me want to get my hands dirty!
5,Great Quick Read,I couldn't stop reading Four-Season Harvest. Elliot Coleman has an easy to read style that is no-nonsense. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to grow fresh veggies for her family. Garden in the spring/summer and harvest nearly year-round is the jest of it all. Great book!
2,"It's okay, but it is too general","This book is a general overview on how this guy runs his high-production, high-cost garden. No details are given on how the average Joe can build or buy the stuff. The wife and I were pretty disappointed. I learned nothing from this book and fell back on the intial plan: build a big quality greenhouse."
4,Solid welll made mounts,Good quality priced right. Easy install and adjustment. Holds and supports speakers within specs with no problem. I would purchase them again.
2,NSC063 Waterpik Hand Held Showerhead,"Shower selectable spray does not provide enough water flow with restrictor removed, was more impressed with aquasource compatible showerhead that is no longer available.Hose is made of cheap stinky plastic, which is somewhat larger than the opening in the receptacle.Over all a cheaply build showerhead with no attention to details.I do not recommend this product without further quality control improvements."
2,Great TV,"I've owned this tv since Jan 07, and like it alot. I bought it when best buy had them for 399 at their local store. It has all that I need. I only have standard Directv (not HD) and my dvd player and dvd recorder are not HD, so I didn't think I would need a HDTV. If I want better sound, I hit a few things on my Pioneer stereo that is patched up to my system. Also this already has the ATSC / QAM Digital Tuner which will be required next year. I also have a Samsung 26 inch hdtv, which is great, will hook it up to my computers tv tuner card someday.UPDATE: this TV quit working around Jan 2012. It's had problems for the last couple years. Picture would turn all red, or look like a rainbow, or TV would turn off by itself. Hauled it to the recycler because I figured it could catch my house on fire maybe. Bought a new Sony ex720 3D tv spring 2012 at Amazon for a great price."
2,THE NIGHT JESUS MET SANTA CLAUS children's book,"I enjoyed this book, as did my students. However, I found attached in the MIDDLE of the story, PAGES FROM ANOTHER BOOK!!!! This made it difficult to share and keep the children on task. Would advise the powers that be to check their products BEFORE sending to customers.CWills Cape Cod, MA"
3,Quest for the Potion of Power,"This is an episode of the Captain N television show from the early nineties which featured a boy named Kevin who was transported by way of his NES system into a parallel universe called Videoland, where video game heroes are real people! The Quest for the Potion of Power is the one where Kevin (Captain N)travels to the land of Hyrule to meet his favorite video game characters, Link and Zelda. It seems that someone wants to ressurect an evil person named Gannon that Link killed.The race is on to find the potion and save Hyrule from Gannon's clutches!This video is a must for anyone who remembers watching the Captain N series."
5,Sudoku fun,I always feel like I have really exercised the brain cells when I do Sudoku. This game has not disappointed. Love it.
1,Save your money on this DVD,"You will most likely be very disappointed if you expect to see footage of Bengal tiger in its natural surroundings. There is very little footage of real tigers in the wild. Most of the movie is about some Indian villagers who hired a British hunter to kill a tiger that attacked and killed one of their villagers. Even a National Geographic documentary utterly sucks on this DVD. It shows some Indian movie star that lives in New York City and then goes back to her country to see tigers in the wild. They talk about poaching and loss of natural tiger habitat, but there is very little footage of tigers in this documentary. So far, I could not find anything that even comes close to BBC series: The Life of the Mammals, Blue Planet, and Life in the Freezer with David Attenborough."
1,Boring!,"Beaytiful scenery, but an utterly boring story.Perhaps it came off better in the original IMAX, but I doubt it."
1,Still have not received it--been a month since my order,Still have not received it--been a month since my order. I sent you the new address and I still do not have the item.
2,easy to use but not much to learn,"This product is very easy to use & interactive. It works well but there is very little to learn from it beyond some basic nouns (colors, numbers, food, modes of transportation); it is however, the only audio Telegu program I could find. It's almost impossible to learn Telugu from most of the books out there. For what it does teach, it does well."
5,The Best Magician's Wand in the market,"Lets be honest, anything that Magic Makers sells is of excellent quality and they always back-up their warranty on any item contrary to Mak Products and others. If you are into Magic Tricks you need to buy this ""Wand"".It will add to your presentation and repertoire in your close-up performances. This is the best ""Wand"" in the market and highly durable to last you a life time. A second class competitor ""joe Porper"" manufactures his for $200 bucks! Get real!!!Magic Makers Wands are the real deal, compact, durable, high quality and beautifuly designed!Till this day 2010 no one makes them better!!!Magician Rasputin"
4,Lots of information,"Good information, anacdotal and statistical.Could have done with out the information about hooking up with other expats, but I guess people need that."
2,Experience is everything,This book has a lot of good information for potential retirees. The author is an excellent travel writer but has never really lived in Costa Rica for a long period of time. She just came to write the first book and returns to update it. To really write a book of this type one has to spend years living in a country. Also she is far too young to relate to issues retirees have to confront. If she were older she would have more credibility.
1,Hot with know flavor!,"I gave this Hot Sauce one star because i love hot sauce with heat and flavor but this Mega Death is to freaking hot, So hot it has know taste it just hurts you can't even taste your food you put it on so if your looking for a good prank item buy this and sneak some into your victims food and watch there face you'll get a good laugh! PS: Don't Forget To Record The Prank & Upload The Video On YouTube."
5,God Almighty.,"God Almighty. That pretty much sums up this sauce.If you're looking for great flavor and usability you've come to the wrong place (although considering the heat its really not THAT bad..)This sauce will humble you to the God's of spice. You will truly know what pain is. I had a small spot on the top of a fork and my tongue was burning for about 20 minutes. I had a spot on a cracker and my entire mouth (not just my tongue, my cheeks, gums, throat, roof and floor of my mouth, and sinuses) were burning, this lasted (even with milk to stop the pain) for about 20 minutes, if I didn't have milk in my mouth it felt like there was 100 white hot knives stabbing every spot in my mouth.In short : SWEET!"
5,great taste with the heat you want,"one of the the best sauces i have had, has all of the heat (maybe more)of the insanity line with a fantastic flavor-i need more"
2,More of a heat additive than a proper sauce.,"I tried this on pulled pork and on a chicken sandwich, and I found that I dislike it for the same reasons I dislike the original Dave's Insanity Sauce: it's a heat additive with no attempt to make it taste good. What little there may have been to taste got washed down with the first gulp of milk, leaving only the bitterness, pain, and desire to have nothing more to do with this sauce. Lower-tier sauces in the Death series--like Pure Death and After Death--have great flavors and are worthy as condiment sauces, so I was disappointed by this one."
4,Carter p4594 elec fuel pump,"The fuel pump works great easy install,performs like it should. The only concern is the power wires I have has them get loose and come off. Overall it is the pump I thought it would be. Thx"
3,Interesting translation,there are many translations of this greek classic of Homer. I just compare this translation with other translations of Homer's classic story entitled The Odyssey.
2,The Odessy,"My major complaint with this translation was the way it was written. Throughout the book, written as a novel as opposed to in free verse, there is a forced sense of grandeur from the author. Conversations between characters seem more like monologues than any actual dialog. Two chapters, or books, that immediately come to mind are when Zeus and Poseidon are talking followed by the almost laughable conversation between the main hero and a swineherd. Rouse uses a more rustic dialect for the swineherd yet maintaining the long drawn out mini-speech approach used previously in the book."
2,Required reading for school,Needed to buy the book as required reading for my daughter's English class. Book is kind of confusing and not her normal type of reading material.
4,"The Smoke Lesson by Chris C. Geneva, NY","Book Title: The Berenstine BearsIn this book the Berenstein Bears are trying to stop Smokey the Moose from selling tobacco to children. Four children and their papa bear went out to stop the moose. On their way they found two kids,Joe and Sammy, smoking the Mooses' tobacco that he sold to them. The children had a meeting with Smokey to try to get him to stop selling tobacco to small kids and adults, but the meeting didn't work. finally the children and the papa decided to get the police involved.I think this book was very good. It tells children that they should not smoke. Sometimes things look cool because the person selling them looks cool, but it can kill you. I think the children were smart to go after someone who is bad on the inside that was selling things that could hurt them. You should buy this book for your children because it teaches them how harmful smoking can be."
2,Wrong edition...not a 1970 edition,"It was my mistake to not know or pay attention to the difference in editions of this title. I was looking for a replacement to a 1970 copy I have of Quest of a Hemisphere, but this was a school edition of the same title from the 50's. The difference? the earlier edition had several authors and less text and simplistic illustrations. Boyle took the text back in her 1970 editon, and brought it to life with great pictures and illustrations, and an excellent section on the establishment of the new US government. A more complete instrument for education. My bonus to having this book I don't really need? Boyle autographed it! So buyer beware..."
2,Moles are tougher than the repellent,After reading the material on the Liquid Fence Mole Repellent I thought I had finally found something that would rid my flower beds of moles. I have been battling moles for years and tried just about every thing including traps. I actually used about three times more of this product than the instructions suggested. It appeared the moles left for about a week but they have returned again. I sprayed the area again and the moles didn't even leave that time that I could tell. They were still making tunnels. I give up!
4,Mole repellent,This stuff works. It may take 2 applications but since the second application moles are gone from my yard.
1,"Not work at all, waste of money","Bought this last year, not work at all. No matter how much you put there, the mole still come and go without issue. My lawn did not survive the winter after apply this product. The mole still so active on my lawn during snow time."
1,consumistic magazine for gear-addicted eggheads,"This magazine is perfect for people who think that knowing all the gear and buying most of it, helps you to make you a great guitar player.It's just the opposite: all this gear crap is a filler, a distraction. Trust me, I have been there, and it was a mistake. Get rid of this magazine and learn to play by going to a quality tutor or online."
4,Very helpful indeed,This book is a great place to start for anyone either wishing to resurrect fantastic old pieces or just make the most of the ones they already have. It's packed full of diagrams and should have something for both amateurs and the experienced alike. It basically tells you how to deal with furniture restoration and maintenance from simple polishes to complete overhauls. A great resource to have around.
3,"""U.S.A. Pieces (qty.)"" equals ""Made in Taiwan""","If you don't mind spending $$$ on chinese tools, then go right ahead and buy them. You can get the same quality USA-made tools for less money. Mayhew's been an enormous waste of my time with their deceptive advertising."
2,"Cute shoe, but very hard to wear!","This is a very cute shoe and seems to be comfortable when you try it on. However, it is extremely hard to walk in because the heel constantly slips off. I tried putting rubber pads in the back, but the front has such little coverage that the back slips off all the time. I got a lot of compliments on the shoe, but I had to get rid of them because I couldn't walk 5 feet without it hurting. The shoe fits true to size but there is no grip."
3,Not sure about the titles!,"It looked cute on the website, but when I received it....I wasn't sure what all the labels 'Wine Lines' meant. I could have been just me not understanding the product and the different languages."
1,Poor design and quality,"I purchased these speaker stands from Best Buy based upon a recommendation from a worker there. Because these stands were one of the more expensive sets at Best Buy, I thought they'd be fairly decent. However, they are ABSOLUTE garbage... the upper portions were not of matching diameter and did not install properly into the bases. I ended up cracking the plastic adjustment ""bolt"" on one stand. The one stand that was not ""defective"" would not stay at the proper height and the speaker would rotate too easily. The screws stripped the plastic pieces. The base is too light... it would take very little to knock the speaker stands over even without a speaker installed. Overall, because of the price and picture on the box, I thought these speaker stands would be a good buy; however, they turned out to be very flimsy and defective. Even if one of the stands was not defective, I still would not recommend them. I am no longer using these stands. Don't waste your money."
4,Curious Correspondence,"The letters that make up this volume, written by the infamous Marqus de Sade, show more about the man himself in terms of his daily thinking than he his erotic fictions ever could. Whereas his fiction is born of his imagination, what he writes here are his own opinions and ideas of his life and his surroundings.He writes frequently to his wife from prison and has what I think of it as, a scathingly dark sense of humor about it all. If your already a devote fan of the Marquis or just a curious reader, (then even before you pick up his own works, I would recommend reading this first to get an idea of the man) then you should find this collection of curious correspondence to your liking."
5,How beautiful!,"I've read this novel about three different times and I always find something new in it. The way the early church is portrayed is very endearing, yet somehow realistic because of the conflicts involved.Some other reviewers have wondered about the Seneca sections, feeling that they detract from the book rather than add to it. I think Seneca was actually included to serve as a foil to Paul, to be a contrast to him, as well as show the historical context of the plot.There was actually only one thing that sort of bothered me: The whole ""speaking in tongues"" bit. From what I can gather in the Bible, it wouldn't have been like it was described in the book. I wonder if Mr. Wangerin's personal bias didn't sneak in there. Otherwise, this is an excellent book."
5,great book,This is a very well written book. The author keeps you guessing and still provides enough facts to make the book read so you feel you are a part of the events taking place.
4,One of the better Christian novels,"I bought this book on a whim. I've read The Robe (see my review - a reader from Ky) and thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. I've read several religious novels and most of them, quite frankly, are not very well written. Paul, by Walter Wangerin Jr. is an exception. He has crafted a very fine tale without letting doctrine get in the way. What doctrine there is unfolds slowly and naturally throughout the novel, mainly through the personalities of the characters. His description of Saul is not exactly what I had pictured in my own head, but it was interesting nonetheless. Not in the class of The Robe by Lloyd C. Douglas, but Paul is a very good book in its own right. It makes me want to read The Book of God, also by Wangerin. I found some of the negative reviews of this book to be very much off the mark. They have perhaps let their own personal religious zeal cloud their literary judgment. Bottom line: Paul: A Novel is a very good novel!Thanks."
1,A small minded western look at a liberal eastern religion.,"The title of this book would more appropriately be ""The Saktas, A biased and predjudiced slamming"". The author is constantly refering to tantric practices as ""revolting"" and ""disgusting"". The book was written by an early British colonialist, and its authorship is aparent in every sentence. I do not understandy why, if he felt this way, did he take the time to write the book."
5,Blackened Sumerian Swing,"One of the best black metal albums ever. The middle-eastern influence on strings and the Mesopotamian lyrical themes set Melechesh apart from your standard metal band; their fist-pumping, head-snapping, metal-frown-inducing grooves put them three cuts above. ""Emissaries"" is required listening for any metalhead worth his or her salt."
5,A Thoroughly Exciting Experience,"This book is a page turner for me. I cannot put it down. The selected topics covered by the chapters are so well chosen and so clearly written, that, when finished, the reader is led, through an absorbing tour of ideas, to appreciate the heroic progress of calculus up to the development of measure theory. This is a book one is glad not to have missed out."
4,"For the right audience, a good book","There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book."
5,Great side reader for a calculus course,"I wish this book had been around when I was taking calculus a few decades ago. It is extremenly well written and explains all the reasons why mathematicians had to introduce all the concepts and definitions you encounter in a calculus course. Reading this book on the side will tell you exactly why you're doing what you're doing, and where you are going. All students of calculus will benefit from this book."
2,Too simple!,"Bought this for our on with Autism. Wasn't complicated enough to keep his attention. Received his in plenty of time and in great condition. Just not complicated enough. But, thank you!"
1,Flawed,I was looking forward to this book based on my enjoyment of Rosen's book on Jack Molinas (Wizard of Odds). I was severely disappointed and question my own judgment of the Molinas book. There are a staggering number of factual errors in this book that could have been corrected by thumbing through a copy of the Basketball Encyclopedia or any number of websites that include boxscores of playoff games. I wouldn't have done that but for my own recollections that were at odds with Rosen's reports. I now question whether anything in his other books is worth the paper its written on.
2,"OK, but docked a star for errors","This is an entertaining look at the Lakers historic title run in 1972; however, it is filled with errors of fact (Neal walk a rookie in 1961?) and spelling (Dave Debusschere is a Hall of Famer - spell his name correctly)! There are more examples, and they're pretty disctracting - it's tough to see that a major publisher wouldn't do a better editorial job."
4,Insight into the early NBA,I enjoyed this book. It covers an early part of NBA history after the Celtics had established a dynasty and just as the Lakers were heading in the same direction. There is great insight into the play and personalities of many early stars such as Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West. I am a Lakers fan and particulary enjoyed it for that reason.
4,Interesting and funny,"This book tells the story of the 1971 - 1972 Los Angeles Lakers, the team that won a record 33 games and the eventual NBA championship. I read this book as a basketball fan, and found it to be quite interesting and entertaining.The book begins with a good background to the players and coaches prior to the season, their successes and their failures. The book also gives a short history of the NBA up to that point.The meat of the text focuses on the season itself, with a short summary of each of the 82 games played during the regular season, and each of the playoff series the Lakers went through to become champions. The text discusses both events on-court, off-court in the locker-room, and outside basketball altogether. Therefore, we get a glimpse of life in the NBA; the parties, the traveling, and of course the interactions between the media, players, and management.In all, this was an enjoyable book to read, taking about three hours."
5,Eternal wisdom for frazzled moms,"I came across 'The Apostolate of Holy Motherhood' 12 years ago when I had two lively toddlers, and another baby on the way. I was tired, frazzled and up to my neck in diapers. This wonderful book gave me a new perspective on the challenges of motherhood, marriage and life itself. Its divine guidance, in the form of messages from Our Blessed Lady and the Christ Child, helped me to find peace in the midst of busy days and sleepless nights. I have referred back to the book many times in the intervening years as my children were growing into teenagers and have found its words to be consoling, uplifting and unfailingly wise. And why not? Our Blessed Lady was a mom, too!"
3,Amazon is the greatest!,"After months, no years, of searching for this album, I am delighted to have a copy in my possession! I have yet to try out the cd, but tonight looks like a great chance to do just that. Thank you so much, you guys deliver consistently good service and the options are enormous."
3,CD,"Delivered in a timely manner. All of the ""teeth"" that hold the CD in the jewel case were broken, but the CD was not scratched."
3,a bit disappointing,"After reading the uniformly positive reviews, I was very excited about this book - then felt a little let down when I read it.I loved the main setting. And the characters - especially Gladys - did indeed offer many insights that were humorous and on-target.But I felt that the entire story, and the characters, kept me at a distance. I never felt that the author was allowing me to really get to know the characters; the portraits to me seemed shallow and sketchy. Probably as a result of feeling shut out in this way, I found the book to be a slow read; I forced myself to finish it because I had already invested quite a bit based on its promise, and I did care enough to be curious.I hesitated to write this review because I didn't want to be wet blanket, but I felt that perhaps another point of view should be included among all the praise. The book is still a pretty good read, and had the potential to be so much better."
3,"Ok, but not the best!","""One Heart"" was OK enough for me although I did not finish it. The plot with Ivy and Gladys seemed OK but once James came into the picture all went amuck. I just couldn't get into the rest of the book and mostly just gave up."
5,Poignant and funny. The writer does it all!,"Ever since I read an excerpt of ONE HEART in The Kenyon Review about a year ago, I have been anxiously awaiting the publication of this novel. And it was worth the wait. It's really terrific -- I gave up my lunch hours to finish it. It's sad and compassionate, and yet really funny. This writer can do humor better than Lorrie Moore -- she doesn't need the neon-flashing punchline. I loved these characters the way I loved Gus and Clara and Deets and Pea-Eye in Lonesome Dove. I'm glad I happened upon this author -- the writing world's best-kept secret."
5,Great for Colicky Babies,"I bought one of these at the local drugstore when my kids were babies (40+ years ago) and loved it. My son had colic and this helped calm his gas so he could sleep (and me too). When my granddaughter was born and was colicky, I looked everywhere for a baby hot water bottle. No one seems to sell these anymore. Amazon came through! This is one of the best tools that new parents can use, and it's safe ... no drugs. I would recommend putting a diaper between the baby and the hot water bottle - just in case it's too warm."
4,A nice incentive to get the kids into bed on a chilly night,"I bought two hot water bottles for our two kids and we have used them almost every night this fall/winter. They love having a warm spot in their beds when they get in. It is incentive for them to go to bed! These are high quality items - thick so that you aren't sure if you put warm enough water in them for a few seconds until the rubber warms up. My only complaint is that the hole at the bottom (for hanging upside down) isn't large enough to fit on any hook I have, so I have to hang it upright to dry from a hook near the fill hole."
3,Just Okay,"I wanted a small hot water bottle for travel, and the size is perfect; but it is too thick. It takes forever to feel the heat, it seems like it never gets really toasty, and the texture is uncomfortable. Also, oddly, the hook is on the wrong end to allow hanging it upside down to drain/dry."
3,Pretty good,"This game is pretty good overall. It's great if you're a Breakout fan. If you're not, it's just okay."
3,A disappointment in an otherwise fine series,"This has been an excellent series with a compelling protagonist, fast-paced plotting, psychological depth and some great depictions of New York and Chinese-American culture. But this book isn't up to the level of the others in the series - the author doesn't seem to have put her usual care into it, and the conclusion feels downright rushed and a bit perfunctory. It's still worth reading, but I hope the author will drag herself away from her other series and give April the attention she deserves."
2,Not Her Best,"A Clean Kill is the June 2005 paperback entry in Leslie Glass's April Woo police procedural series.April is the American Born Chinese [ABC] New York City detective, daughter of the infamous 'Skinney Dragon' [who is guaranteed to make your mom look good], and newlywed wife of hunky Hispanic precinct captain Mike Sanchez.Maddy Wilson, wife of a celebrity chef, is found slashed to death in the shower of her fashionable town house; the next day her best friend is murdered. The obvious suspects? their nannies.I didn't find this one to be up to Glass's usual standard: the characterizations were very shallow, lots of threads were left hanging, and it was one of those 'wham, bang, thank you ma'am' endigs.Some of the books in this series are quite good. If you're looking for a good police porcedural with a strong female main character, I suggest that you start with one of the earlier books."
2,Nothing special,"I find that I am reading Leslie Glass novels for old times sake more than anything else. When I started reading them, I really loved the character of April Woo and the relationship with her Chinese family. Their scenes were so funny. In addition her relationship with her partner, Mike Sanchez had a lot of chemistry. These days Skinny Dragon Mother and Mike are barely in the novels and the plots have not been that compelling. This addition to the series is disappointing in that it does nothing to move the characters forward. The secondary cast was not likable and I would have killed them all off."
4,Good Installment of the Series,"Although predictable, I enjoyed this installment of the April Woo series.I was a bit shocked though to find April and Mike married. I had to go back to the author's website to see if I'd missed an installment because I was really surprised that she'd marry the characters off and have it happen ""off-screen."" That could've been a book all by itself.I do sense the series will be winding down soon with all the hinting about April not feeling well, and her mother's potions to try to get her pregnant. It's too bad, because this is one of the better procedural series out there."
4,APRIL WOO DELIVERS AGAIN,"AS ALWAYS, LESLIE GLASS CONTINUES TO ENTERTAIN AND AMUSE WITHSOME VERY GOOD DETECTIVE WORK THROWN IN. THE PLOT GIVES AFEW SUPRISES AND INSIGHT INTO THE NYPD. THIS IS A BOOK I WOULDGLADLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR SUSPENSE THROWN IN WITHA TOUCH OF HUMOR. APRIL'S PARENTS CONTINUE THEIR DEMANDS ANDINTERVENTION INTO HER NEWLY MARRIED LIFE. THE BOOK ALSO GIVESA LOOK SEE AT THE GOINGS ON IN THE UPPER WEST SIDE OF MANHATTANDOMESTIC LIVES AND FOIBLES. IN THIS CASE I HOPE IT'S MOSTLYFICTION. COCAINE, PERSONAL TRAINERS, AND MISGUIDED NANNIESMAKE FOR A FUN READ."
3,It's ok for on the go,"First of all the use of the word ""cooling"" I found misleading. It is two pieces of plastic held open by a clamp you can adjust and one of the pieces has a hole in it to allow the bottom of your laptop to breath. There are no fans. I am using it on my bed right now my laptop slides a little on the ""non-skid"" surface. Also it is not as wide as a laptop, it is the size of a piece of paper. Folds up and has a handle so you can take it anywhere. Seems best as an emergency backup if you can't find something else."
3,good,It was OK. I wont say very good. It cools my laptop moderately. Because it does not have any fan you have to position it well so that the air goes out. My dell has vents both in the bottom and in the side so its tough to find a position so that all of the hot air goes out. But its size is good you can carry to any place you want to.
2,"Not for 17"" laptops","The product description says it is for 17"" laptops but I found this item was too small for even my 15.6"" laptop and unfortunately, I had ordered a second for my sister's 17"" laptop. If product measurements had been included I would not have ordered. Too small and poorly made in my opinion. I'm not sure why others gave it such good reviews."
4,I like it....,"I actually like this product.... for some reason I expected fans to be under it, but ehh no. But I do think it's actually a great product. My laptop no longer overheats no more. I use it mainly for my nightstand and bed. I recommend to purchase it."
4,notebook stand only...,"If you're looking for just a stand, not a cooling fan stand, this product is for you. Light weight and strong, easy to use. Good product."
3,Cooling laptop stand,THis product is ok for cooling off standard laptop. Would not recommend for extreme over heating like mine though. But also great for propping up the laptop so you dont get strained.
1,an expensive piece of plastic,"An expensive piece of plastic. It took 20 minutes to cut open the tight wrap. The tilt is too low to elevate the notebook screen to eye-level for comfortable viewing. The notebook can easily slip over the plastic because there is no catch at the bottom. The opening is too small for good airflow. It would be better to pay a little more money on something well-designed and with a fan. Try the Targus products, for example."
4,"Good Product, But Not Worth $20","I like the product and it does what it claims to do; but if you can find something similar for about $10 or less go for it. It's just two pieces of plastic on a hinge with, for lack of a better word, a little kick stand to give you two different heights. The price is the only reason that it did not get 5 stars. Then again maybe I'm just cheap. Lol."
3,Cheap Portable Notebook Computer,"Well, the idea of buying the cooling stand was to avoid laptop over heating. However there are certain difficulties in accomodating the laptop over the stand and for it to stand still. I also feel that it still gets heated, but i have a Toshiba and thats very particular of those kind of laptops. The price was reasonable compared to other cooling stands so I can't complain if its functionality its not the best."
2,Just plastic with a hole,"I failed to read the description thoroughly and didn't notice that this is really just 2 pieces of plastic joined with a hinge. There is a hole in the top plastic piece which opens when you separate the two pieces of plastic and elevate the laptop with a little wire brace. The hole may or may not match up with the fan on your laptop - it didn't match mine. If you don't elevate the laptop,there is no hole for heat to escape. NOTE! There is NO fan - just a plastic stand with a hole in the middle."
3,Kensington Lift -off Portable Notebook computer cooling stand 60149,"I like the product, it works well; although, one of the two little plastic pieces broke off rather quickly (the small piece where the stand extends, allows the two pieces of the stand to move/separate). Broke off after 1 weeks use. So far, I am still able to use the product."
2,Not practical for 17 inch laptops,Useless for large screen laptops. Doesn't balance 17 inch laptops. Obviously made for smaller laptops although product info doesn't say so. I can't use it because each key I hit causes the laptop to wobble.
3,Its ok,well its better than nothing but I would suggest you spend a little more and buy one with a fan. They keep the laptop much cooler
3,OK,"This product serves the purpose I bought it for, but the heat from my computer melts the glue that attaches the rubber piece to the base. Then it slides a little. But all in all I like it because my computer doesn't shut down anymore when it gets hot."
4,You get what you pay for!,"I was not sure what a laptop cooling stand was when I ordered it but delivery was prompt, price was reseasonable and I am satisied with the product. It does get my laptop off the table and allows air flow underneath it."
2,Seen better,"Basic tilt stand with hole cut in to let computer breath better. Hole doesnt line up with all my heat escape holes. Dropped it on carpet and a hinge broke...brittle plastic. I think this works but is worth less than $10, not $20 as charged.I also have a Belkin u shaped stand with no hinges and a fan and all exhaust holes breath...better."
2,Not as useful as said,"I am dissapointed with this product. You just have two position to raise the hinged support. The fit between my new ThinkPad T61 and the support is loosy. It keeps moving because the product has just an small rubber framework to act as a resistant to slide. Additionally I am not pretty sure the air flow is improved. The name ""portable notebook coooling stan"" is too much."
1,JUNK !,"I hate this cooling pad and this is why. One, its to narrow the laptop slides off and you have to keep your legs close together or else it falls between them. Two It still gets hot! Three the anti skid rubber only goes around the center hole, not enough to prevent the laptop from sliding off. Four , the hinges on the bottom stick into your legs.Five its to expensive this product should sell for $1.99 at walmart its total JUNK."
2,Spend a little more,"I bought this to help elevate and cool my laptop. The design is decent, its lightweight and portable. The part I didn't like was my laptop kept slidding down and the elevation wasn't angled enough. If that wasn't enough the platform itself wobbles and makes it difficult to type on."
2,Laptop stand,This product was ok but cheap it's better to go to Fry's for $7 and buy one that is better without shipping charges etc. But Amazon is good and stands by their product that's why I always use them.
1,Piece of useless junk,"I believe this is this first or maybe the second time in my life that I have ever written a review here. I of course brought this product based on the 5 and 4 star reviews. I can not believe that people actually gave this piece of junk such a high rating. I wish I could give this thing a 0 rating. Needless to say, I'm going to have to spend money to sent this crap back. In no way shape or form is this a cooling stand. Instead, it is a flimsy lift stand. My computer still runs hot. This stand is misnamed and misleading. This stand is for a toy laptop."
2,Not really a cooling stand,"After reading reviews that people were able to use this stand while sitting on their laps and that's exactly what I wanted. Yet, the first day I had it and used it on my lap, it shut off within a few hours. In the next couple of weeks of having the cooling stand, it hasn't worked. My computer is constantly over heating, no matter if the computer is on my lap or on the table. It just doesn't work on keeping the air circulation going on my computer, so my computer is constantly overheating and shutting off. The Targus chillpad worked much better, it's just to bad that the usb cable for it no longer works."
4,"useful, light, and easily portable plastic computer tray","This tray does exactly what it says it will do in its promotional ad. It is easy to assemble, and because it is light, it is easy to move around and to take with you. My computer has never slipped off the tray, due to the rubber strip present. The tray can be changed between its two different height settings quite easily. While some people might feel it is a limitation of the tray that there are only two different options of settings, I do not, because the tray goes exactly to the heights I need. I suspect most, if not all users, will have the same experience.My only complaint is that I wish the bottom of the tray were softer so it would be more comfortable when I rest my computer on my legs.I definitely recommend this tray and am very happy I purchased it myself!"
2,Functional but poor quality,It serves the purpose. But the construction is very flimsy and it broke 2 months after purchase.
3,Ok product,Would like to be able to adjust it to a better heightgreat for if you are on the go I need one for a more permanent option.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"I ordered this, and it broke after less than a month. I was sent a replacement, and it LITERALLY BROKE IMMEDIATELY. This is a terrible, cheaply made product, do not buy!"
3,Kensington laptop lift-off,"Fast shipping, compact for portable, little bit expensive, you have to take care to use, the laptop may fall, helps in cooling the computer"
4,"reasonable price, does the job","I was having trouble with an overheating laptop and this solved the problem instantly. I have a small 13"" however, and it slides forward sometimes. The rubbery rim around the hole loosened and slipped a bit because of this, but I simply pulled it up and stuck it back in place. Not exactly something you expect from a quality product, but it only cost me $15 and suits my needs perfectly."
4,Does a good job,"I travel a lot and this Cooling stand does a good job, It keeps my notebook cool. The only issue is the rubber stripping will eventually ware off."
1,USELESS PRODUCT,"THE KENSINGTON CIILING STAND IS A TOTAL RIPOFF,I HATE THIS PRODUCT,IT IS OVERPRICED AND USELESS.IF I HAD THE PACKAGE IT CAME IN,I WOULD DEMAND A REFUND."
1,How Disappointing,"I thought this product was going to be great for setting my 17 inch laptop on the table and keeping it cooler. I set my laptop on it and all it did was wobble on the stand, because the stand was so small. If I had a 10 inch laptop maybe it would work, but trying to type with my laptop on the stand was like I'd put it on a teeter-totter. Just terrible!"
5,A distinctively written and illustrated picture book,"A distinctively written and illustrated picture book by Jennifer E. Sheehan, Chicky Dicky's Animal Pancakes (the fourth title in an original series about the animals from Bumpleville) finds Miss Bumples and all of her animal friends cooperating in a joint project to make animal shaped pancakes. From the mischievous beaver, to the love-struck chickens, to the tail-swishing alligator, everyone chips in with the different chores in this wonderfully entertaining tale for children ages 3 to 8. Also very highly recommended are the other Miss Bumples titles: Miss Bumples Lands On Earth (09700975260, [money amount]); Miss Bumples Moves To Bumpleville (0970095201, [money amount]); and Griffy Giraffe's Accident (097009521X, [money amount])."
1,all wrong,"They said this charger fits a Motorola razr. I have a Motorola razr and no matter how I tried to fit it into my phone, it wouldn't . I asked for one that fit but they have not answered me."
3,Not enough depth for the money.,"If you know *anything* at all about subtractive synthesis (VCO/VCF/VCA/LFO/etc) then this is NOT the book for you. If you are an absolute beginner and have never played with a synth before, then this will provide a ""20,000 foot view"" into the various functions, techniques and terminologies of synthesis. In a colorful style, the author covers numerous topics including vintage synths, analog sound design, controllers, sequencers, effects devices, but does so at the expense of depth. There's more color than content, and in some cases, the author's opinions reveal some inexperience. Primarily, this book teaches terminology - further research is left as a homework assignment for the reader. The author's on the right track however, he just needs to add the necessary depth to a second edition (and fix the grammar!) thereby tripling the number of pages."
1,No real info,"You'll learn more about the author's ""pet peeves"" than you will about Analog Synthesis. I read it twice thinking may be a missed something the first time. Perhaps if you take the subtitle ""A Newbie Guide..."" VERY literally it might be OK, but this book offers less info than than most Synth manuals (and that's saying something). Save your money and check out the Web there are several sites that provide way more info than this book does."
5,"Graceful and elegant results - and great quality, too","I've had this pan for over two years and have used it numerous times. It is a favorite of my many bundts. The quality is exceptional - it is heavy enough to be sturdy and bake evenly, and light enough to lift and move easily. And the finished cake! Beautiful. I think it is a feminine look, and reminds me of the skirt of a ball gown - but perhaps that fanciful thought is prompted by the name Belle. It washes easily (might need to soak a short time)and so far I've never had a problem with sticking. I wish Wilton would design more pans - though I don't know where I would store them!"
3,Faint Pattern,"The Dimensions Belle pan is beautiful to look at, but the pan detail does not translate deeply enough on the bundt cakes. The pan works well, cake cooks evenly and slides out easily. I've used it three times with different recipes (no frosting) and the outcome is the same. Perhaps my expectations are swayed by a competitor mold that has deeper impressions in the casting and turns out like a work of art."
2,SENT IT BACK.....,I LOVE WILTON BRAND AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PAN WAS EXCELLENT HOWEVER IT WAS MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN I ANTICIPATED -- IT WILL NOT ACCOMODATE THE BATTER FOR MY CAKES -- I DONT NEED A PAN I CANT USE SO I RETURNED IT......RARELY RETURN ANYTHING TO AMAZON.......WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT IS OK -- LIKE I SAID IT WAS THE SIZE NOT THE QUALITY FOR ME........
2,L'italiana in Algeri,"First of all, be aware that this video does not have subtitles. The filming is amateurish. Mustafa is singing and the camera is on Isabela. The singing is OK, but the production is almost ridiculous at times. I had just seen this opera at the Met when I bought the video and was very disappointed. Some of the blocking is embarassing as well."
5,Tao of Nutrition Maoshing Ni,I absolutely love all the info in it. It is a useful guide to a better nutrition and a more peaceful way of eating.
4,Funny and thought provoking,"Witty& self-deprecating. A well written, unbiased look at religion and it's role in our society from the viewpoint of a minister"
4,EXCELLENT,This product is well made and good looking. The only reason it isn't 5 stars for me is that I'm used to have a logo or message on my caps and visors.But this visor is great if you want a plain one.Excellent.
2,Cute but Very Cheap Quality,"In this instance, you get what you pay for.These glasses arrived very quickly and the packaging was appropriate. The glasses were barely over-sized (perhaps over-sized for someone petite). The quality was very cheap, and one of the lenses fell out immediately. This wasn't a good purchase."
2,A bit misleading...,"I was disappointed after I realized the Miel & Muscade scent is NOT the same as Vanilla Nutmeg. I burned a large Vanilla Nutmeg (that I already had) & the new Miel & Muscade at the same time, in different rooms and the scent was NOT the same. I love the Vanilla Nutmeg, that's why I ordered these votives. Normally, I rave over these candles- not this time. The packaging was adorable, as always; but, the scent was off."
5,Response for reviews,It does say right in this description that it does not come with injector plate... Which you wouldn't need anyways if you have a high performance intake that has direct ports already pre drilled and tapped for you... Don't put on a car that couldn't handle the power you will just blow your motor and look like a fool...
1,Totally Superficial,"Why spending 475$ in this book? With this money you can buy: 1 bottle of a good french vine, or a cachemire pull or a ticket to Acapulco..."
4,Link takes you to the wrong product,"Don't click on the New Paperback version, as you will be taken to Dungeon Crawlin Fools, rather than No Cure for the Paladin Blues. And if you're like me, and you don't notice, you will order the wrong product which you will then wrap up and give to your husband on Christmas Day. And he will look at you and wonder how you went from hanging on to his every word to not listening to him at all in 10 short years, and he will sigh gently."
3,Read the online comic,"...1. There is a free version of this available online.2. It is stick art. Literally. Remember drawing stick figures? Ok, good. This comic is *just* that.I like ""The Order of the Stick"" but i don't go shelling out money for things I can get for free. No one should. You can get this for free online. I don't see the value in this at all.If you like playing ""role playing games"" - which is sitting at a table with friends rolling dice and pretending to fight goblins and dragons - you'll like the online (free) comic.I don't like doing that. I still like the online comic. It is pretty good. I definitely wouldn't spend money on this, though, nor want someone to. If i want to read a back-issue... it is FREE. ONLINE."
1,Amusing but TINY!,Got this as a stocking stuffer. Tin is cute but so tiny that its impact is really lost. Pretty pricey for its size to begin with but especially so when you tack on a $1.95 per item shipping surcharge!
2,product as advertised but arrived a week late,"I specifically ordered this product with rushed shipping so it would be here in plenty of time to give as a gag gift at a birthday party. It showed up a week late, and was not there for the party."
2,Constantine is capable of far better.,"3 Heralds is a well-packaged booklet collection of three short stories by the author of the cult classic Wraeththu trilogy. It's nice to look at and a supplemental to any Constantine fan's library. But that's it. The first story, 'Such a Nice Girl,' is interesting to a point with a few intriguing devices, but never realizes its great potential. 'Last Come Assimilation' also has potential for an interesting science fiction story, but is clumsily handled. 'How Enlightenment Came to the Tower' is downright silly. Hardcore Constantine fans will want this, but Wraeththu fans looking for more will be disappointed. Spend your money on the Grigori books instead."
3,For the Intermediate Artist Who Likes to Get Dirty,"Besides drawing with the things, Flattman shows how to prepare your own papers, and even roll your own pastels! Wonderful for the incurable do it-yourselfer who wants custom ranges of colors, but you'll need a garage or basement space you can devote to the messy business (and you'll need a respirator, too, not just a dust mask). There are lots of finished works, but the how-to step-by-step stuff uses too few steps usually. You need to have a good background in drawing already, and experience with composition. Flattmann comes to pastel from watercolor, and never thinks you might not already be accomplished in another form of painting. Pastels were my *first* media, when I began lessons when I was six, so they are not ""inherently advanced."" I would recommend you use this in conjunction with Bet Borgeson's _Color Drawing Workshop_."
3,great book but end made no sense.,I read The Best Christmas present ever so I ordered this book. It was as good as the first till the ending which made no sense. They never explained why what happened happened. I was disapointed.
5,The Best Halloween Ever,"I downloaded this book for my grand-daughter to read, and also read it myself. A fun read for any age!"
2,More trick than treat,"I loved Barbara Robinson's Best Christmas Pageant Ever and have given it as a gift to several friends, but am disappointed in the Best Halloween Ever. I see that others enjoyed it, but to me it lacks the charm of the first book. It seems forced, as if the author were doing her best to churn out a sequel to her successful Christmas book but not quite succeeding. I wish it were as charming as the Christmas story, but it just isn't."
4,The Best Halloween Ever,"My nine year old son and I bought this book to review and present a report to his class for Halloween. My son is not a fan of reading however, this book kept his attention. The descriptions were vivid and entertaining."
5,Great as always,"We love all of Barbara Robinson's books. My family read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever when I was young and I read it to my daughter as soon as she was old enough to listen. This book like her other ""Best"" books make you laugh out loud at the characters and make you see true human nature. It is not just a children's book by any means. I could pick one up and sit down and read it for a good laugh anytime. Halloween is a favorite holiday in our house which made this one appealing. I would highly recommend any of Barbara Robinson's book and especially ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever"" and ""The Best School Year Ever"" as well. We read all of them out loud to the family or on a long ride and it makes that time go by quickly and with a lot of laughter."
3,ENtertaining to young kids...,"This book was a good enough read for before Halloween. The story, while entertaining enough for young kids, will drive any adult crazy. There is no chance a few unruly little kids could ever, EVER cause an entire town to cancel Halloween, it simply wouldn't happen, and with the whole premise of the book based on that one fact, it sort of ruins it, at least for me. My daughter was less bothered by this aspect and thought it was a funny and cool story. So just let them read it themselves, and everything will be fine."
4,"Nice, Cheap and comfortable","I wear those shoes to work, they are very comfortable and I think I will be wearing them for a while"
2,Plasticicity,"My speakers weigh about 5 lbs each. They cause these mounts to flex a bit, so the adjusting was tricky, Pointed up a bit with no weight to make it straight with the weight.Also, the screws they included to drive into wall studs are made of really soft metal with poorly formed phillips heads. After stripping the first two, I gave up on these and used some left over screws I had in my shed.These are working well enough to keep, but not that great."
3,It works but not perfectly.,"I bought these mainly because they seemed to work OK and were inexpensive. Well, that is exactly what you get: Average not expensive items. They do NOT hold much weight if you hold them on a ""high"" angle even if the speakers are less than 10 pounds. So if you plan on actually have to keep high and weird angles with your speaker you better get a stronger stand."
4,Good product for amazing price,This product was amazing for the price. It was easy to put together and came with all the parts necessary to mount my speakers to the wall. I highly recommend this product for the price.
4,Good product,"These speaker mounts are great. The only negative is the drywall anchors and screws, they don't work. I had to use some others that I had."
4,Good ceiling/wall mount speaker mounts,"I purchased these to mount my Klipsch Quintet speakers at the rear of my media room. I had previously mounted rear speakers at the top corners of the room and wanted to do the same with the new Klipsch. They are made of very strong plastic and assembly went very quickly with me attaching the speakers using the 1/4x20 screw through the pad. The only issue that I had was that the two assemblies slide together with the set screw to hold them. I would have preferred that there were some sort of design that would not allow them to simply pull apart (and hang from the wires) if the set screw became loose from vibrations. They were easy to adjust for the proper angle and locked securely into position. I recommend them, but caution you to tighten the set screws very well or you could find them falling from the ceiling or wall."
2,Generalization of personal problems,"I don't doubt the validity of the experience of the author, and he has a good handle on methods for dealing with his problems. His error is generalizing his personal problems to chuch members and whole churches. I would not agree that solving background emotional problems is the singular key to solving church problems, the origin of church problems is much more diverse. The workbook was also not helpful and was rather negative; it presumed problems in most of its questions. Our small group is reluctantly diving into this study; I would not have chosen this study for our group, but it was mandated to us. The response from group members is surprisingly uniform."
4,Deep waters,"This book is not for the faint of heart. Be courageous though, read it and allow God to minister deep into your soul."
3,Help in the fallen world,"If you have ever read larry Crabb's books and left them frustrated about how your Church/small group could ever actually fulfill the desire for connecting from the inside out to the safest place on earth (like how I used his book titles?), then this is a book for you. Seriously, this book takes a very practical look at what the Church needs to do to provide a holisitic view of discipleship, that allows for a person to have deep emotions and how to properly process them. Its not about more bible study, more time at church, involvement in another program etc... Its about taking an honest look as an inidividual and as a Church, and helping to grow from within that pain. Good read, could have more practical application, but is the only book of its kind that I know of."
4,An important book for a vital subject,The book was helpful to have a perspective ofhow to develop emotionally in the church.It was heavy on testimonies and could havea bit more biblical basis.
3,Good Confessional,"The book rates well as a confessional of a Pastor who almost burned himself and his family out. He had a bit of an awakening as to how to make himself emotionally more open and available to others, and how to set up more healthy boundaries for himself. The principles that he offers are practical, but not as important for ministry professionals as just reading his story and reflecting on it. There's a helpful self-exam included in the book which can be photocopied and used with staff teams. My only hesitation with the book is that he describes the crisis happening in 1997, and the book was published in 2003, meaning he got everything figured out enough to write a book about it in 5 years, which seems to me overly quick."
1,"Pop-psychology, channeled or what?","What part of this came from the Bible? old Testament, New Testament? Come on folks get back on the narrow road..."
5,Read this book cover to cover!,"""The Emotionally Healthy Church"" is not another another ""pop psychology"" ""feel good"" ""happy church"" book. Pastor Pete Scazzero takes off the Band-Aid and digs deep...now healing can begin! If you are at a loss as to where to put your foot down next, spiritually speaking, read this book! You will find your next step on the road to true Christian maturity! This book has ""integrity"" written all over it!"
5,Truth becomes personal,"Lose the pretense. The pent up emotions, unpleasant memories, childhood experiences, disappointments, unmet desires, and motives of our heart that we hide behind the veneer of ministry, reputations and titles are bluntly exposed for what they are. Truth finally becomes personal and unbelievably shocking! Jesus was emotionally whole and freely expressed his anger, surprise, joy, and sadness. This book is key to taking an honest look at yourself and relationships. Begin your inner healing and start developing and maintaining honest healthy friendships, relationships and marriages, or mending broken ones. This book is a must read for all Christians young and old, including pastors, leaders and those who serve in any capacity of ministry. Thank you Peter for humbling yourself and baring your soul and teaching us how to do the same."
5,Great product,I love this product. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit hard to store. But it DOES unwrinkle fairly quickly once placed on the stroller. My son loves being in it too.
2,Beware of the cold,"We have a peg perego and this rain cover fits it fine. Although I would agree with the other reviewer that it would be much better if it were longer and came down more in the front. But my biggest complaint is that our cover cracked. Apparently, when it's really cold the plastic gets really hard -- when we had a number of below zero days this past week the cover cracked and now is totally useless to us."
2,Excellent quality but has major design flaw!,"I bought this rain shield after reading another review that said it fits Peg Perego strollers. Since we live in NYC, it is an absolute essential! We had a Prince Lionheart Rain Shield but left it behind on a trip.The quality of this shield is excellent; durable, heavy plastic, nice side vents, etc.The major flaw is that it does not hang down far enough in the front, and when we were out with it last, my 17 month old's feet were drenched because the shield left them exposed. He is of average height but since he will obviously grow before he is totally out of the stroller, this shield is useless to us. (I will save it for any future babies, when we are using the carseat/stroller combo).I am really disappointed and will have to buy another shield."
4,As described,"Book came quickly and was as described in information. Was needed for a class in school for my neice, so this was just right."
3,Bought as gift for male staff members,"Nice looking and large. For a few bucks more get one that it monagrammed and leather. I wasn't blown away with the quality of the material, it's a faux suede look."
3,SERVES PURPOSE BUT IS OVERPRICED,"The item is roomy and holds quite a few items. As stated in other reviews it could've used an inside compartment. I just put items in smaller plastic bags to keep them neat. The quality of the bag is mediocre, probably won't last for years for frequent travelers. The price is way too much for what you get, but since my last travel bag finally gave out (after 20 years LOL) I had no choice but to get a new one. This bag should not have been more than $15 tops."
2,Not Durable,"Firstly, I'll give the product its props and convey that it is definitely a handsome bag. Its design is terrific as well. So, if you want to sit at home and admire it, you're all set. In contrast, my travels called for the item to actually be used. Set off on an extended trip with this item in tow and it lasted less than 60 days before the leather hanging strap on the end snapped at the rivet and the stitching on one of the two zippers came undone. As a result, I had to wrap a bungee cord around it to keep everything from falling out and really didn't use the zippers anymore because it was easier to reach straight in through the eight inch gap in the side."
4,Ample room to spare!,"He had a really cheap previous toiletry bag. This one is of good mid quality, very nice wide opening which makes getting at all your items really nice. He used it right away for an overnight trip and really liked that he could fit everything he needed and had ample room to spare!"
4,Great Quality,The item was a lot nicer than i expected. The fabric felt much more expensive than i thought it would be. My only complaint was that the color was so dark it was hard to distiguish it from black.
4,From the Heart,When I met Ann in 1981 what struck me about her most was the love she showed for others. In this book she tells us of her inner demons and how she let them get control of her life because she needed us to love her.
1,Poor Will -,"I gave a star for husband Will and what he's had to endure from a self-consumed wife viewing life and traumas from her 'me' vantage point. If she has misread others and their conduct, THEY have to convince her otherwise?! Dream on... Too much doesn't add up in this book. I respect the author's individuality and right to live a high drama life, but there is no way I'm donating this book to the church library and thereby condoning poor choices and excuses made - and worse, cloaking them in scriptures to further excuse bad behavior. As much as I enjoyed ""I Gave God Time"", I disliked this one."
3,Sigh,"The book is certainly interesting, especially when so many of us as young adults wished that we could somehow maintain her seemingly perfect, God-filled life. I give the book three stars for her writing style, which has always left me engrossed in story. I remember thinking ""Huh?"" years ago when she commented about holding up an entire airplane full of people to go buy a woman a lemonade. I kept wondering how many people missed their connections, perhaps missing time with family or other important life events because of that lemonade. I'm not sure those people were loving the word impossible. Certainly, I'm glad she's made peace with herself. Perhaps in her next book she will find a way to make peace with those she deceived. The moral for all of us is ""Get real."""
4,Excellent.,"We love the Baby Einstein videos and this is no exception. My two year-old calls it the ""Tiger 1-2-3"" video. He already could count but didn't recognize the numbers when he saw them. That changed after day one of watching Numbers Nursery. We bought this for him and he watched it over and over and over the first week. Now we watch it once every other day or so. He loves it and counts along with the children. His favorite parts involve the animals, of course. I do wish they had used the numbers 6-10 though. He learned 1-5 so quickly. I think even taking it to 20 would have been good. Otherwise, great video."
1,Borrrring!!!!,Even I could not watch this DVD. I feel asleep watching it with my 16 month old son! It's boring and does not keep the baby's attention for long.
5,Great for introducing numbers,"We bought this for our 18 month old, and it was a great introduction for learning numbers.One of the things I like about it, is the puppets count objects, so there is a meaning to each number, not just a sequence. Between this and the number puzzles we use, our daughter, now 25 months has a good understanding of numbers, their order, and what they mean.She also loves the puppets, and the different scenes keep her engaged in learning."
5,BEST LEARNING TOOL!,NUMBERS NURSERY IS THE BEST! My husband and I are both teachers and we love Baby Einstein educational videos. Although the numbers nursery says that it goes 1-5; there is a special tab on the menu that shows a video for numbers 1-10. My daughter is 16 months and is able to say and recognize numbers 1-10. Of course we worked with her individually but the numbers nursery video is also a great asset as well. It is an extension of what you are already doing with your child. DEFINITELY BUY THIS VIDEO. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
3,not complex enough and mistake on french track,"I buy these dvd's mainly to teach my chidlren french since we don't get french tv.so two points. i agree with other reviewers about the limit of numbers. my sons are two year old twins who can already count to fifteen. Five seems too easy at this point.as for the French track. get better QA for your dvd's because a poem that states a cow is flying in the sky and then shows a horse is not an acceptable mistake. My children know the difference between a cow puppet and a horse puppet, even with a hat."
3,You don't need videos...,"Although BE videos are a wonderful concept, they aren't a staple needed in teaching your child! We have several BE videos at home for my 2 year old Daughter and I keep it running on her TV in her room when she is in there playing. She is not a TV watcher and will only focus her attention on it when something catches her eye. I have been doing this since she was about 2 months old. My Daughter could count to 11 by time she was 20 months old, knows at least 5 primary colors, and can recite the entire alphabet since she was about 18 months. She also has a vocabulary much larger than that of some Pre-Schoolers and is very articulate. However, I do not think that BE videos had much of anything to do with this. What does matter and will help your child in learning is YOU and/or a Caregiver taking time out to TEACH your child the old-fashioned way!"
2,Slow and boring,"First introduced to baby when he was 11 mos old. He didn't like this one bit so I assumed perhaps he was too young to appreciate Baby Einstein videos. Re-introduced at 15 mos, and then 18 mos. Same reaction from him, he would sigh, fuss a whole lot, and when older would walk out of the room the moment he discovers it's the numbers video. But he would gladly sit through and interact with other Baby Einstein titles like World Animal Adventure and Baby Wordsworth.The pace of this video is very slow though it may appeal to very young babies watching a DVD for the first time. I feel that it doesn't capture attention the way the other Baby Einstein videos do. Numbers 1 through 4 seem like a drag while suddenly number 5 picks up pace as if time was short and the video had to end. My 20 month old now knows his numbers 1-10 and learned the sequence through books and live demonstrations, sadly not from this video. He would however pick up new words from other Baby Einstein titles."
4,A Gift,"I gave this as a gift so can;t say much about it, actually went to Best Friends Animal Society and was on their list of things they needed"
3,Kindof a mixed review...,"We have a 7 month old lab mix that chews EVERYTHING and loves ropes. I thought since this rope toy was tied in knots it would be harder for her to chew up....but alas it is in pieces all over the floor. It has taken her a couple weeks, but it has been a mess all over the house. She loves the toy though. Just wish it was harder for her to pull apart."
2,Didn't last long,I gave this to my 50 pound lab mix and it took him about 10 minutes to pull out the end of the rope from the knot and start fraying it. Instructions tell you to discard the toy if it becomes frayed so it made for a very disappointing buy. I would only recommend this for a very light chewer.
1,Rubbish,This toy lasted about twenty minutes after we gave it to our Borzoi puppy and then became dangerous when all the strands of rope came away from the ball. A waste of money. I would not recommend this to anyone!!!
1,WARNING,"My sister works for a vet. Although many dogs love these typr of toys, the toys fray, and the dogs tend to eat the strings that fray off of it. The strings tend not to digest and in some cases can cause balls to form in thier intestines, causing very expensive surgeries. Just a fair warning to any consumer looking to buy any dog toys made from string."
3,Didn't last very long,Our dog loves chasing balls but she is also a chewer & this toy just didn't hold up to her chewing.
2,Puppy loved it,I got this for my 7lb morkie! It's about the size of his head and pretty heavy but he loves it! he carries it around and chews on it. He did start to unravel the ball and that gets all over the house expect to vacuum everyday! I probably wouldnt buy this again just because of the mess it makes when its unraveled.
3,Kept my dog busy,My dog is a yellow lab and loves to pick apart strings and ropes. This was an ideal toy for her but inside of a month she did manage to pull all the ropes up and out and made the toy a baldy. This did last longer than the similar ones I have bought at my local pet store so I will buy one again. This does leave thin strings on your carpet as they are pulled apart but can be easily picked up. I watch my dog to be sure she's not eating the strings.
2,Unties Easily,"It is tuff, but it untied in a few days and I only have a small toy terrier. Now it's just a rope & I already have some of them."
2,great toy at first,"I have a golden retriever that rips every toy apart that she can. When this came in the mail I thought I had found a toy she couldn't destroy, I was wrong. Although, this toy lasted a little bit longer than most, it also was destroyed by my one year old puppy."
4,Good for aggressive chewers,I am surprised at the number of reviews that state this product fell apart after only a few minutes. I have three aggressive chewers (a boxer dog and two Boston terriers) and have a hard time finding toys that they cannot destroy. We have had this ball for years. It is one of the few toys I can say that about.
2,"Dog had no interest, doesn't dry out either","Our dog (Great Dane) is a prolific chewer. She will chew on anything from Kongs to cardboard boxes, but for some reason, she had absolutely no interest in this toy. I even tried stuffing the crevices with treats, and still no luck.Even if she did like it, I discovered that if it gets wet (washing, wet grass, slobber), there is NO way for it to dry out, and it starts to stink like rotten cloth. Had to toss it in the trash a few weeks after buying it.I gave it two stars because if your dog happens to like rope or chasing a ball, I would say the construction of the toy was good quality."
2,Not for strong chewers,"I have two dogs of the same breed: one has had this toy for years and never ripped a piece off. When we got our second dog, we bought him his own rope ball and he tore it apart instantly, there were rope pieces all over the house. The toy is unusable now. I recommend this toy if you're sure you dog will never be interested in taking it apart, but if your dog has the smallest interest in unraveling this ball he will succeed."
2,Nothing amazing...,"We bought this for our labrador, who loves toys especially balls, but he has never been interested in this. It is really hard and heavy. He hasn't been able to do any damage to it, but that's because he doesn't play with it."
4,Strong knot,"I bought this toy for my miniature Poodle since she was chewing very quickly through her tennis balls. I made the mistake of buying the medium, but it turned out great, since after she chewed thought her first knot I cut away excess fabric, and it became a smaller toy. Works as a chew toy, a fetch toy and a ball. It's gonna take her a long time to destroy this one."
2,Dog not interested,My dog loves rope toys but he is not interested in this toy. I am not sure if it's the shape or what?
3,Too big for my Havanese.,"This toy hasn't been played with very much because it is bigger than I expected, and too big for my Havanese. Even though he loves rope toys this one stays in the basket."
2,"Love rope toys, fell apart very quickly","I feel that rope toys are almost ment to fall apart. My always do and it flosses my dogs teeth. However, as soon as she got through on of the ropes in this knot the whole thing fell apart and I have pieces everywhere. I have had dogs my whole like, they have always loved rope toys, however, NOT recommended."
3,"Good, for a while","This toy is great, until your dog figures out how to unravel it. From that point on, it's all downhill. It then becomes a rope with a ball at the end, which can be flown about your house if your dog gets too excited while playing with it. Then, as it unravels more, large pieces of rope begin falling off. Our dog pulled off a section of rope that was several inches long - not just a few strands, but an entire section of those twisted, multicolored ropes. It was at that point we took it away. But she enjoyed it a lot until that point."
1,Lasted 10 minutes,We have a Weimaraner and she chewed this up in 10 minutes into pieces. I do not recommend this for a Medium to large dog who is an agressive chewer
2,Thirty minutes of play for 5 bucks...,"My dog loves this toy. She loves to play fetch with it. Unfortunately, when I tire from throwing the thing she starts chewing and within thirty minutes its an unraveled mess that I have to throw away. Even though it only costs five bucks I was hoping for something that could at least withstand a few days. If you want to play fetch with your dog and then put the toy straight away consider it. However, if you just don't have the heart to take away your loyal friends toy (the dog) then skip this."
1,Nuts for Knots Ball toy: Nuts!,"The strings on this toy came unravelled within a day. Luckily, Harley did not swallow any."
2,2 hole mask,Maybe it's just my head but I have difficulty seeing through the small eye holes. They are sown together at the brow and this interferes with vision. Other than that it's fine. Nice and warm and the knit is comfortable.
2,Not everyone can write a cookbook,"I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the instructions are poorly written and the book's organization is odd. Don't get me wrong, I will attempt some recipes but it'll be stabbing in the dark as far as technique/timing."
4,If you're into this sort of thing...,"...then you'll enjoy it. Reality TV in its early stages. Don't get it if you're expecting nothing but people getting naked and going at it in the back seat. Some nudity.The best one of the lot was the woman recounting her 9/11 experience with a close 2nd being a man talking about his life living with primitive tribesmen.It's amazing what people will say to total strangers. Of course, there is no way to know if anything they said was true or not.Worth getting if you're into social voyeurism."
5,Long Overdue,"These two discs are totally informative and entertaining. I have long wanted to have these treasures on CD, and my wait was not in vain. The Victory Thru Airpower was always a teen-age favorite of mine, and having lived through the war years was a true inspiration patriotically.The disc featuring the cartoons are a PLUS and provide the current generation of younger people a glimpse into what were sad, but productive years. We all pulled TOGETHER in a common cause and these discs are a tribute to patriotism, which, today, is in such short supply. The aviation history is very well done. Truly, this has got to be a memorial for Walt Disney, a true patriot in his lifetime.Thanks for bringing the treasures to the public.AviatorPittsburgh, PA"
5,Disney Classic are Classic's for a reason,A great collection of shorts for which many have not seen the light of day in a long long while. If you collect Disney or just enjoy the early years of animation then pick up this collection.
5,Disney at War,"I love cartoons and I love them when they are put at work for a good cause. I have had the chance to see some of the Disney products to support the war's effort during the Second World War but I was unable to buy them. So, I have waited during many years and now, surprise, they are on sale on a DVD. If you like the style of Walt Disney cartoons, it is really a good one with great imagination. Donnald Duck in the Fuhrer's Face as a German, Pluto as a mascot, the seven dwarfs working to promote Canadian War Bonds, training material and so on. It is really a good DVD and a product of quality. It is at the same time interesting, amusing and historical. Also, don't miss the movie ""Air Power"" included; it is genius. Micheline Anne Montreuil"
4,World War Animations,"Some of the animations I saw on Saturday mornings, growing up in the '50s and '60s. Most of them are not politically correct for today's kids, which is sad. The overall impact of the collection serves to demonstrate how totally committed both our citizens and armed forces were to winning the war. The videos are a good balance of propaganda and often boring training films. The narration at the beginning of each section is interesting, helps to set the mood. The whole thing is very well done."
1,I agree with the other 1-star reviewer,"I didn't realise this had happened to other people. But i ordered this off Amazon, got it a week or so later only to find an empty case."
1,Warning! Disney ships empty boxes,"HelloI have been waiting impatient for this little beauty. Got it last week. Big surprise: When I opened the proberly sealed box from Disney, there was only a empty DVD case in it without any DVD!First they let you wait a few month and then all you get is a empty box. Great!!!!!Kind Regards A"
4,lots of fun,"Brought back memories for me as these were shown on early television quite often. Pricey, but these are Disney, so of course...."
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!,Hanna does an excellent job describing the horror and sacrifice her family endured as a refuge during WWII. Her prose is honest; her story remarkable.Read this book!
1,WEDGIE!!!,For thoose of you highschoolers out there watch out! If a mean person comes along this thing screams wegie
4,Christmas Trivia Makes Enjoyable Stocking Stuffer,"If visions of sugarplums are dancing in your head, fuel the fantasy with this small book of interesting facts, quotations, Biblical verses, and gift ideas centered on the joyous Holiday. Small enough to tuck into a stocking hung by the chimney with care, or to put in your purse and pull out when you need a spot of Christmas cheer.

There's also info on Christmas movies, songs, and gift ideas to make your holiday bright and cheery."
1,fJudith Krantz Collection,"The recording quality was atrocious. There were many skips, stops and whole segments missed. I thought that the collection was to include Mistral's Daughter, but it was not included. I had specifically asked for Mistral's Daughter. I am in Baja Mexico, 600 miles below the border, for the winter, so I can't send the product back which I would have done if I had been in the states. I will never order from Amazon.com again if I plan to watch the product later where I can't return it quickly. Shyrl Bailey Mulege, Mexico Baja Calif Sur"
1,judith krantz collection,Great. Just what I was looking for. Thought I would never find this collection of story that I have seen on TV. Thanks for having all of them in one collection.
5,"Inspired scripting, outstanding photography, flawless film.","The Resurrected Life: Understanding The Meaning Of Easter is a film of artistic images drawn from the Holy Land, soul-stirring music, and the wisdom of prominent spiritual teachers representing various Christian traditions. Designed as a non-denominational cinematic presentation, The Resurrected Life will inform, inspire, and enlighten anyone who hungers for an encounter with God or who seeks a path of personal transformation and renewal. The production values are flawless, the photography outstanding, and the scripting inspired. Color, 60 minutes."
3,Hasbro just needs to improve its quality,My daughter is a huge supporter of MLP. She has all of the accessories and has a HUGE assortment of ponies but once again we are so disappointed by the cheap poorly made accessories that break with hardly any use. After this last purchase of the amusement park and needing to put the ferris wheel back together constantly (it leans forward) I also agree that we will stick to the ponies and save our money on the addtional pieces to be released. I hope Hasbro is listening because there poor manufactoring is what is going to cost them in the long run and not lost interest in the My Little Pony line itself.
2,"Very disappointed, LOVE Ponies",My Granddaughter is so in love with my Little Pony things now. We have most of them and most accessories but this is definetly top heavy. This is the 1st item I've been very disappointed with. I'd read that the Ferris Wheel can't hold 3 poinies but it can't even hold 2. The set-up keeps coming apart . What a Disappointment! So much of the other things that are Pony related are vey cute.
3,Cute But not well built,This is very cute put toghether. The problem is KEEPING it together. My daughter will be pushing the cart down the rainbow & it'll just break off. She only puts it back together about twice b 4 putting it away & just playing with the pony alone. Same problem goes with the wheel. The turning handle won't stay on right so it doesn't turn right. Not at all worth the asking price.
2,Cheap Construction!,My 2 year old got this for her birthday from her aunt and uncle and it does not stay together at all. The ferris wheel won't even hold the combined weight of the 3 ponies included in the pack. Plus one of the included ponies was posed the opposite way than the other 2 so she was very hard to use with this toy. My daughter has more fun taking this toy apart than playing with it. With no noises or lights or anything the toy gets boring really quick (if you can get it to stay together that is).
2,pony heaven for mlp lovers,"These playsets are great. I am so glad hasbro brought back mlp. My daughter has collected them for about four years now. We have the 80's playsets and the new ones. I found all of them to be great. But these are not toys for toddlers or very young children.They are plastic and do of course break. They are also not mindless push a button video games. They require IMAGINATION!They are not babysitters to prop your child in front of.My daughter is eight and her and the ponies enter a world of imagination that lasts for days! Yes you set them up and leave them. If you want less space taken up buy a polly pocket. The playsets have just enough activity to start an idea for play and leave the rest for the childs imagination. I love to watch my daughter play with the playsets and I join in on the fun too! Keep up the good work hasbro. Don't let the mlp line go away again,please. We love them!"
1,"Falls apart, not worth it",I spend entirely too much time picking up the pieces of this toy as it keeps falling apart. My daughter just isn't interested in it and it takes up a lot of space when it is put together. Save your money and look for this at a garage sale. That's where ours is going next summer.
2,Falls Apart,"Could have been fun! The 3 pieces of the track keep falling apart. I can't move it anywhere. I can't even use it where it is! Add a pony to the wheel, and it leans forward. We will superglue the 3 track pieces together. It doesn't do much for the price."
2,Not worth the price!,"My oldest daughter saved her allowance for this, and I feel like Hasbro owes her a refund. First, there are only two activites to this set, the ferris wheel and the ""roller coaster"". The ferris wheel will fall apart if the child isn't careful, although unlike other reviewers ours will hold three ponies. The track for the coaster comes apart at the drop of a hat, and forget about trying to move this thing. As much of a cash cow as the whole MLP line is, you'd think Hasbro would put a little more money into production, even if it raised the cost of the finished product. I would NOT recommend spending your money on this one."
2,"Falls apart too easily, wait for a clearance sale","My daughter loves My Little Pony, but I'm very disappointed with this set. Every time she plays with it, the tracks come apart. Also, even when I securely 'snapped' the ferris wheel portion together, it just won't stay attached, it's always falling apart. The butterfly 'wings' that you use to hook the ponies to the ferris wheel are constantly falling off also.It's very frustrating for my daughter, she loves it when it stays in one piece. Unfortunently it falls apart so often, that it's just not worth the hassle to constantly be putting back together.A good idea, Hasbro just needs better quality control."
2,Very disappointed in this toy!,"I agree with those who say this toy falls apart easily. There is not much activity involved in it. The wheel holds three ponies, but it leans forward from the weight of them and is hard for kids to spin. I got this on sale, thankfully, but it's still not worth even the sale price! I have seen other My Little Pony accessories like this one and they blow this one out of the water. Don't waste your money on this."
5,YOU HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER CORRECTLY!!! TRY IT!!,"As I have found with many of the reviews for toys I have purchased for my daughter, not everyone is on the same page about them.This is a great toy. You know those things they send you with the toy called instructions??? You gotta read them! Playing on a more level surface, like a table the track DOES stay together.As far as the ferris wheel, push the rods from both ends securely together. I did not have the two pieces pushed together enough either and noticed the wobble to it. Pushing these pieces together firmly is the trick.I know some of the toys I have purchased do indeed fall apart or break way too easy, but you have to give this one a chance. It really is not that bad."
1,disappointed,"This toy is a complete piece of junk!!! It looks very cute, but it falls apart constantly, and the ferris wheel doesn't even hold any of the ponies. My daughter (3 years old) was so excited when she got this, but after constanlty calling me or my husband to fix it she has totally lost interest. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!!"
1,Poorly made*********************************,"My daughter collects my little pony and she had to have this. July 20, 2006 we purchased this for her 5th Birthday.The Ferris wheel falls off - My husband looked at it to see if he could fix it but he said it was the manufacturing molding. I wanted to return this but my daughter would not agree. MAG"
1,This toy is not worth your money!!!,"This toy comes apart easily...once you put the ponies on the ferris wheel, it bows over and breaks away each time. It is not worth the money!! Buyer beware!"
2,Very poorly made,"I should have heeded the reviews I read... this toy is made so badly... the whole thing leans over which makes it almost impossible to play with. My daughter is absolutely pony crazy, but she played with this for about 15 minutes when she first got it, and hasn't touched it since. Save your money for something else- the new Butterfly Island playset looks nice..."
5,THE BEST!!!!!!,I got this yeterday and I love it but on the ferris wheel the green wings somtimes fall off but this is and awsome toy go buy it!!!!! By the way I'm 10 and I LOVE my little ponies!
2,wish I read reviews first,"My daughter enjoys everything My Little Pony. She even enjoys this toy although had I read reviews prior, I would not have purchased this item.The pieces always fall apart and it's annoying to constantly reattach them. I agree with those who have stated that they expect more from Hasbro. I will carefully consider future My Little Pony purchases."
2,Disappointed...what junk,"I am very disappointed with this toy. My daughters love My Little Ponies and this is the first playset we purchased and if all the other ones are as bad as this one, I am sorry to say this will be the last. Although my daughters do love to play with it, it has become very tiresome for me, putting it back together all the time. I don't care what any reviewer says, no matter how you try to get the pieces to ""click"" together, they don't and as soon as you move it, or bump it, or blow on it the track falls apart. We haven't had any trouble with the ferris wheel leaning, YET, but I am sure it is in our future. I do think I agree with the one review and I am going to try super glue, maybe that will keep it together so my daughters could actually play with it for more than 5 minutes before it breaks. I really would not recommend anyone buying this toy."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,What a PIECE OF JUNK!!! My daughter received this toy for her birthday and couldn't even play with it because it continually kept falling apart. The ponies would fall off the ferris wheel and the roller coaster kept breaking any time she would even touch the toy. She already has the MLP Dance Studio and loves it so I was so disappointed with the Amusment Park. If you are thinking about buying this toy DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY buy the MLP Dance Studio instead. We are returning the amusement park today!
1,We Love All The MLP Playsets But Got Frustrated With This One,"The Amusement Park Playset does not want to hold together. In fact it does not even go together properly. We have the Butterfly Island Playset and it is wonderful. I wish it could have been made as well. Oh well, I did get the Amusement Park at a clearance price."
3,super glue super glue super glue,"I read the instructions and had my mechanical genius huband put it together and it still comes apart. My daughter is 4 and should not have to be so gentle. It's a toy from a major toy company (Hasbro) and should have some quality. But, she loves it. So we will super glue it together. Wait until this goes on clearance."
4,Not a Mattie,"One can not accomplish world records all the time. Each record needs special conditions. Every fragment must come together perfect. But for some reason I sometimes expect the same kind of story to always come from an author who may have had great sucess in the previous book I'd read. I had read Mattie some months ago, I thought it was one of the best stories ever, so I was expecting to much of Sallie. Sallie is a good story however and I can recommend it to anyone. I grew up in a town that had a residentual area just like Lizzie Jones. And I new every boy and girl from that neighborhood as we all went to the same country school. My parents forbid me to go there and associate with any of them. I did anyway cause some of these kids were nice and I had fun playing with them. So it was not difficult for me to relate with Lizzie. I will read J. Alters other books."
1,My experience,"The concept is good, but this device is cheaply manufactured; the cord is not even long enough to hold it beyond 20 feet. The suction cup is just too small and it leaks unless you sprinkle it with water prior to using it. The really bad news is that I haven't found a better option out there."
3,Not what I expected,"The attachment is not the standard screw in type and does not fit on my Unger pro-pole ... Perhaps this was in the fine print, but it was not obvious when I bought it."
2,Not Really that Great,I bought this because I have 20-foot high ceilings and track lighting. It didn't work well at all. I couldn't get it to attach the bulb no matter what I tried. I ended up buying the Unger Flood Light changer and that did the trick. This product just didn't do the trick for me - just increased my frustration level.
3,Lesser Rubinstein,"I have never considered Rubinstein's RCA Saint-Saens #2 as one of the better efforts in his discography. The passagework in the second movement isn't very accurate. Yes, he had an affinity for French music and the joie de vivre is certainly there. It's just that this not one of his better achievements as a technician. The Franck and Liszt pieces are definitely better played. Wallenstein and the pick-up bands provide good accompaniments.Rubinstein always wanted the solo piano spotlighted in his concerto recordings. Unfortunately, the piano sound in the Saint-Saens is not only prominent but boxy and constricted with limited high frequency content. The other pieces have much better sound.This is one of Rubinstein's (and Living Stereo's) lesser achievements. If you already own the older Living Stereo redbook CD (same program) you need not replace it. The gains from the SACD refurbishment are minimal at best."
2,Odyssey Through O2,Odyssey Through O2 is a remix project of Jarre's album Oxygene 7-13 and is mix of electronic music and trance. The problem is that the original tracks are so amazing that tinkering with them leads to a result that is often less then stellar. Many of these so called DJs I have never even heard of. Being a famous artist like Jarre could he not have asked people like Shep Pettibone or Oakenfold instead of these hacks. The booklet contains liner-notes written by the DJ's. Allmusic gave this release 2.5/5. I give it a weak 2. 2/5.
4,The Advanced level looks like western dancing,"I bought this book as homework for my regular dance classes. The imtermediate lessons (actually looks like beginner) is of HIGH value. It covered the triple step and how to make it look correct. Although, where I study the rock step is at the beginning and not the end, but it is actually minor because after first basic, they did the rock step first anyways. It also helped me with the spots where you initiate the turns, which has been a personal challenge for me who started with single step swing.The basics of left and right turns were gold as well. The hand positions presented make more sense then the way I am being taught in class.The advanced level stuff I wouldnt use, its more like country style than I cared for. However the beginning sections were well worth the money spent."
4,Great book - you should buy it,"This book says its about Richard Burton and his companion Speke as they explore East Africa. The characterization is great! Its full of adventure! There are no references so who can say if its accurate. The details are good too. Its good to read, even if you are not interested in history. It stands on its own."
2,Ho hum..,"On a positive note Sharon Green's characters are very well devloped. Unfortunatly she also has a tendency for using cliches and I don't for a minute believe that people in that era would speak the way most of her characters would. Each member of the blending seems a little too perfect for my tastes and there was far too much time spent whining about how bad the situation was. Naran's lack of talents seemed to be a little bit disappointing as well as the fact that she is now one of the 6. I'm sorry but there is a reason why this story is under the ""fiction"" section and that is because the characters are not realistic."
4,New Blending Book,"I enjoyed this book but one thing that annoyed me was the fact that it introduced a lot of new characters, some of which seemed to have no relevance to the story. Hopefully now that Ms. Green is finished with the introductions the next book will move much faster and tie all the story lines together. One note for new readers: if you haven't read the the blending series before this do so, because you will be completly lost without it. Besides that the book got really interesting at the end, complete with a traditional cliff hanger ending. I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Way too sweet!!!,"This is about twice as sweet as I can handle. If you like sugar this is for you, if you like to actually taste your tea I really don't recommend this. They could be using a great tea in there but I can't taste it over the sugar! At least my kids like it."
2,Chai Latte concentrate,When mixed as directed had a weak chai taste and no color. Would not buy again
2,Disappointing,"My son (who is 5) loves everything Veggietale. Buying him anything Veggie related and he's going to be happy. He also really loves to play video games; this seemed like the perfect fit. He played this game for about 20 minutes and turned it off. I've tried several times to get him interested in picking it back up with no luck. I then played it to see if I could get some interest from him...no luck. When a 5 year old Veggie lover doesn't want to play, there is something seriously wrong with this game."
1,NOT RUST PROOF,"I bought this only a few weeks ago and after using it for 5 or 6 times, I see rust spots already appearing all around the edges of the frame. Too bad that it rust otherwise it would been a good warmer cabinet."
2,Deceptive,"The ad leads one to believe that these units are matched to work together, or at least is sold as a combination unit that works together.That is NOT the case,it is simply a sealed end space blanket (large) and a hand warmer (large).Having used it to be sure I.........found the following to be true.What you get is a foil blanket that gets very wet (from normal body h20 loss) when used with or without the hand warmer that is inadequate in its thermal output.Buyer beware.I suppose in a TRUE EMERGENCY (not as is said in just about everything today)but a true emergency it may keep you from freezing to death for a short period of time, but I would not recommend it."
4,An excellent book for starters!!! Great job....Gallagher,"This is an excellent book for those who want to delve into finance. It is equivalent to 2nd year material. Finance, most often offered in 3rd year here in Canada, requires knowledge of statistics (i.e. stats, econometrics...etc Intermediate level; 2nd year) when reviewing certain budgeting options; you won't need this for the book. Don't be dismaid, your not missing key information by using this 2nd year stuff (you get all of the math too at an easier to comprehend level).The disk included with mine helps to build your financial knowledge through a website connection and with practice, but this is not mandatory and is designed for the hardcore finance junkies like myself.It is only a 4-star because I want more challenging material, but being a 2nd year course I have to wait until 3rd year."
1,Order delays,The book never showed up. I needed to order it 2nd time and cancel 1st order. It took me almost a month before I got it.
3,"Generally good, but don't trust the homemade putty recipe","This book seems to have lots of great concepts in it for (as the title says) fixing and avoiding mistakes. However, I had a very bad experience with the homemade hide-glue/sawdust putty recipe on page 58. I spent an entire weekend trying to get the recipe to produce something useful, but it just doesn't work."
1,Drake Bell Sucks!,"Drake Bell is one of the most overated musicians I've ever seen in my life! He is a decent guitarist but his lyrics are so stupid and cheesy! The only people that like him are 12 year old girls that think he's hot. I know all the little ""Drake-Lovin-Teenagers"" are gonna hate me but I don't give a ****! You will never find me listening to crap like this...if you want REAL MUSIC, with bands that can REALLY play guitar and can write some awesome lyrics, I recommend: Metallica, Guns N Roses, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, and Slayer.If you are one of the preppy-teenage-drake-loving-morons, vote NOT HELPFUL!If you agree with me and you agree Metallica and Guns N Roses kick Drake's a$$, vote HELPFUL!"
5,Drake Bell rocks!!!,"This is a great CD!! I (Like many other preeteens) like Drake. All of his songs are very well written! (By himself with a few other people) Even thought he is a nickelodeon star (I stil recommened his show on Nick to people of all ages), this CD is the work of a professional singer and songwriter!! Even if your not a preeteen girl like I am, I think everyone will LOVE this CD!!! Drake Bell is a star on the rise!! I recomend all of the songs. It's a pop/rock album with a twist. Keep em' coming Drake!!"
4,"Hello Drake, How talented are you???!!","I have to admit that I went about the whole Drake Bell thing backwards. I started off with ""Out of Time"" and then received ""Telegraph"" as a gift. It was not hard to transistion,believe me. It's not as polished and there- in lies the charm. The earnestness pours through your speakers and all you can do is sit back and wonder when Drake Bell is going to overtake Justin Timberlake in popularity. The guy is walking talent. His songs have an accessability that reaches across age barriers and as a mother that is huge. My kids all LOVE this and wanted me to give 5 stars...(but I still have a thing for his second cd) I(personally) will still have to grow with this one I guess....but the ones sitting behind me REQUEST this."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I caught an episode of Drake and Josh, while at a family member's house. Drake sang in the episode, and I really liked his voice and sound. So I checked him out on Amazon the next day and decided to buy his album. It's been a perminant in my car player since it arrived. I'm impressed. Planning on buying his newest as well!"
2,not recommended,"Therion Magnetic Shoulder Wrap - Therion Magnetic Shoulder Wrap - AC523A respected pharmacist stated that such magnetic devices do no good. It is not harmful either, but just not worth purchasing."
3,Not your best investment,"This watch looks neat and workes well for long distances. I bought it as a replacement for another one (another brand) which broke. The 2 types of frequencies gives me problems using the watches together. People always notice the watch is very fat/bulky. It is lightweight however so I don't notice it too much. When I bought it I took it out of the wrapper and the face piece (plastic)popped off. I replaced it easily but this makes me wonder about the longevity of the product. So far it still works ok. For the price, it's not bad at all."
5,Great Addition to WD Treasures Collection,"As any Disney buff knows, Walt was obsessed with technology and space. Our beloved Tomorrowlands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts stand as testaments to those convictions, but what a treat it is to be able to watch the man himself get that twinkle in his eye as he tells us, the captive 1960's American audience, about not only the latest and greatest advancements in frontier science, but what the greatest minds in their fields foresee for the distant future. Dated aesthetics aside, much of the conjecture found here is solid, either already realized or still conceivable.This set stands behind only my ""Complete Goofy"" set as a favorite among the Walt Disney Treasures series. As these are all limited runs, if you don't have it yet, I'd advise against waiting."
2,just viewed,"I was a little disappointed. compared to the other disney treasures this dvd was not what i expected. i found it a little boring, the first disc could have explained what took almost 3 hours in about half the time. Unfortunately i was falling asleep and a good night sleep seemed better than finishing the dvd. I have always been a fan/collector/and student of astromony and space travel, this set did not live up to the billing."
4,Great Nails/ Shipping could use some improvement.,"I bought these nails to use for siding my house with Hardiplank siding. The nails arrived in a box where they all looked like they were scrunched together. However, I had no problem loading them into my siding gun (Makita AN611) and they feed beautifully with no jams at all."
5,never missed a beat,i had a case of nails made by the same company but they were pastic collated and hung up constantly in my bostich nailer that they said would work with. the wire collated ones have not missed once!!
5,A good edition for anyone...,"This version of the Iliad is very appealing for a variety of reasons. First of all it's the Iliad, which is one of the masterpieces of Western Civ. Second, the translation by Rouse is very readable and is in plain English. Third, the price is just right, fairly affordable for a classic. The only potential drawback would be that this edition is not meant to be majestic, it's really rather plain and the print is fairly small. But for someone like myself who just wants the story for a good price, this edition cannot be beat."
5,Excellent,"For a first read of the Iliad, this is an excellent translation. Though it is in prose, it maintains the epic feel."
5,Among the best books of all time,"This is an amazing book. The story of Achilles and his fellow Greeks is an amazing tale of pride, love, greed, anger, rage, and human emotion. This book is a wealth of wisdom and philosophy of the ancient Greeks told in the form of an epic. In this book, we see how the pride of Achilles nearly destroys the entire Greek army, how the greed of Agamemnon and his pride cause incalculable losses to the Greeks, and how the cowardly Paris steals a man's wife and lets everyone else fight for him. This is more than a mere story, but a book of ancient wisdom second only to the Bible. The story is amazing... but it is the demonstration of the evils of life and their consequences that make this book truly great. The feelings of the characters, and the ability to identify with their thoughts, feelings, and emotions really turn a war story into a story of the human psyche. 5 stars also go to the translator who has made this book as easy to read as any piece of modern literature."
2,"Language, please","I haven't read any other translations of this poem, nor do I read Greek, but I found the language in this particular version to be bizarre. The Shootafar thing that another reviewer mentioned bothered me, too, but worse was the use of such terms as higgledy-piggledy. (Three times. I counted.) I first read that in a Bloom County comic strip and that's where it belongs. I'll be getting another translation as soon as I can and hopefully it will be one written for adults."
3,Caution against shampoo recipes,"In general I like this book. Although it doesn't have a wide variety of recipes. Anyway, it is rather dated. For instance, I followed the recipes for shampoo. Yikes! Her amounts of tincture of benzoin in there made the shampoo stick to the measuring cup! And nevermind what it did to my hair (hey, I had an open mind). So maybe the way tincture of benzoin is made is different from how it was back then. I don't know, but head's up. This is the only natural bodycare book I have, but I hear there are better out there."
2,Don't bother,"I was soooooo disappointed with this book. It is not easy to follow, and you have to spend a lot of time to find something that might work for you. I loved her Herbs and Things, and used it a great deal. This book however, was to me scattered."
2,Great first 2/3 of the book,"This book begins with much promise. It was so good, that the writing even reminded me of something like a Gabriel Garcia Marquez epic novel. However, the writer should've quit while she was ahead. In the end, she takes the book to far in the direction of melodrama and fantastical mush which doesn't really blend with the genre and style she first presents to us. Read it, but stop before you get to the last 50 pages."
1,Not authentic,"If you actually care about the true color and representation of this painting, do not buy this poster! This painting is actually supposed to be half the size of the poster advertised. Because of this, the painting looks stretched out (because it is) and unclear. The color is also washed out and not true of the original. It was disappointed when I got this."
3,"Stringer, Crossbow","This product is NOT for PISTOL Crossbows. The Limb holders will not stay on the Limb Tips (Too slippery). If you DO get them to stay (at the most-20 seconds)there is NO ROOM to run the string though. The Limb of a Pistol Crossbow is just TOO short for this product. Oh well, I'll it get strung some how, some day..."
5,Beautiful Watch,"I ordered this watch for my 18 year old son for an ""Easter Gift"". He said all of his friends have nice watches! Now he has the nicest one of all. He was absolutely thrilled! It is not too big, and is not ""overwhelming"" on his wrist! I think you will love it!"
4,Movado Luno,This is a nice watch which complements a Movado Military (back museum dial) in my collection. No complaints. It is simple and attractive.
3,Cheap But Does the Job,"This is a cheap product, but who wants to spend a ton of money on birthday party bags? I recommend this product."
1,ICKY unexpected bondage,"I guess when I bought this, I expected light bondage, and this was ANYTHING but. This had water play, deffication, scarrification etc. This is definately not for the faint of heart or anyone with a bad back, as this book had some HEAVY lifting. I didn't enjoy it at all."
5,where is the drew carey show season2 -season 9?,"can any one find info for the drew carey seasons 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? this a very funny to me.why don't they put more of the season on dvd. i seach all of the web for info!"
5,Very Funny Show,"This is a hilarious show, and a show I think is very underrated. This show is a joy to watch, focusing on Drew Carey, a drunken loser, and his bizare friends. Please release this showon DVD, there is so much crap coming out on DVD that suck and this show is left on sidelines and will soon be forgotten by thepublic, though you can still find it reruns, no one likes commercials."
5,Wish they would release the rest of the seasons ...,"Like many others here, wish they would release the rest of the series on DVD. Ah Mr. Cary, if you could just take the time out of your busy schedule over at ""The Price is Right"" & release the DVD's, millions of fans I'm sure would adore you with ""Thank You's"". But, at least we have this season - so - at the VERY least - Thank YOU !!! from one lowly Canadian whom loves this series :-)"
5,Please Release the Complete Series,I love The Drew Carey Show! It was one of the Best Of any Television Productions. Also please release: Just Shoot Me and Becker!!!!
2,Not as funny as I thought.,"This show wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it's okay. No profanity, which is always a plus for me. But I could do without all the references to sex among the chacters."
1,left out disc #2,"this was to come with 4 discs, #2 was left out and replaced with a another Drew Carey dvd which I also ordered seperately. If you are gonna replace one disc with another it should be stated in the descripion. Now I paid extra for what you sent that you were not suppose to and NO disc 2! rip off and not happy"
5,One of the most under-rated shows EVER,"Lately I've been watching repeats of this show in syndication, and even chopped to pieces, it's STILL as HILARIOUS as it was when I watched it first-run! Why in God's name won't Warner Brothers release seasons 2-9? Of course, it was entirely overlooked by the entertainment community (no Emmy nominations? WHY?!? It certainly deserved to win for costuming alone), and now it's being overlooked by its production company. There are eight seasons unreleased. We already have entire collections of lesser shows...And more, in second season Craig Ferguson joined the cast, and his popularity these days is certain to give Warner the sales it seems to want.So....BRING US THE REST OF ""The Drew Carey Show""!"
1,Not as described or pictured!,"I ordered this item because I needed a pair of headphones with in-line volume control that clips on; earbuds don't fit in my ears. I received an item completely different from the picture. They do have the in-line volume control, but they're very uncomfortable earbuds! I couldn't return the item because I realized they weren't right only after I opened the packaging.Tisk, tisk, Amazon"
3,Starts off promising then gets messy,"Ian Rankin is a top author, no question about it. His Inspector Rebus books are brilliant so I was hoping this early book of his (written in 1988) would be readable.I found that the book starts off very well with a fast-paced narrative and an interesting lead character.The problem lies in the middle of the book when the real adventure commences and the story becomes less of a character story and more of an adventure story. I felt that the author got out of his normal routine and entered a field that he was not comfortable with.The action was a bit muddied and far-fetched at times and I didn't really enjoy it.All in all, a book for the fans of Ian Rankin only."
2,"A few good points, but has some problems","I had never heard of Ian Rankin before, but found this book prominently displayed in the bookstore under ""New Releases"" in mystery. The book is not really a new release, nor is it a mystery. It was initially released in 1988 but the first American release was in 2007. This review is like a euology for a person dead twenty years.The novel is a spy thriller that takes place in the UK in the era of IRA bombings and prior to cell phones and ubiquitous video surveillance. The central character is Miles Flint, a refreshingly unassuming and anti-glamorous domestic spy. Flint stumbles into a scandal within his agency that takes him from London to Ireland and Scotland. It is easy reading but plods along for the first two thirds. The prose is simplistic with few memorable quotes. The plot becomes a little bit convoluted as is common in this genre, but the denouement is implausible and has holes.This book is OK for a quick read if you don't have anything else at hand."
4,A little slow at times but a good spy read nonetheless...,This was the first book I have read by Ian Rankin. It is a little slow at times but still a good spy read.
4,"19 tales, only 2 duds","I'd call that pretty good odds. As a fan of Lauren Haney and Lynda S. Robinson, it was a pleasure to have a buffet of delicacies from other authors to sample their style and wordsmithing. I'm going to order some more of these 'Mammoth Whodunnits"" featuring other settings. I don't think they can beat Egypt though as a jewel of a setting."
2,It does clog pores!,This product says it does not clog pores and is oil free. It clogged my pores really bad and it did not help my wrinkles. Switching to something else. I used this for atleast 8 months. Way more than I should have but I must have been using it for the spf protection alone since it did nothing else. It did have that nice olay smell.
4,Absolutely Loved It!,"I am a big Doris Day fan and I love nearly every movie I've ever seen her in, but this is absolutely one of my favorite. She and Jack Garson proved to be a wining team with a wonderful supporting cast! A must see for the music, the story line, but especially the laugh lines!"
5,Amazing TV at an amazing price!!!,"I bought this TV for my bedroom upstairs. It was replacing a 36"" Phillips HDTV. The TV weighs less than the 36"" one. The picture is out of this world. I was watching basketball on ESPN HD and thought I was looking into a window and I don't even care about the NBA, it's just amazing. The audio though is a little weak. It's not that big of a deal because it's just for the bedroom, but if it was my main TV downstairs, it would almost have to have a surround sound system hooked up to it. I got this TV for about $800 from Amazon through TigerDirect. Free shipping. No problem with the delivery. They contacted me a couple of days before coming out and they were there when they said they would be. I just had to pay for tax because I live in Florida. I was so impressed with this TV that I got rid of my 51"" Sony HD downstairs and purchased a new 56"" Samsung DLP TV. Just like that little girl with the elephant says ""It's the mirrors."" So true."
3,Inexpensive TV,"Only reason I purchased this TV was because it was fairly inexpensive. I put it downstairs for the kids to use. Of course the TV is not as good as a plasma since you need to be directly in from of the DLP projections, but for the kids it is good.Stick with the LCD and plasma Tv's if you want a family TV."
2,DLP Lamp Review,I have a Toshiba 42HM66 Model # TV. We like the picture quality of the television but the sound is lacking - can't increase the way you want. The one major problem is we have had it 13 months now - and have to change the DLP Lamp - which costs over $300. This television we figure has about 2800 hours of usage on it. These lamps are advertised usage over 3000 hours - that's so false!!! I am so upset and know that i have to purchase a new lamp every year - i think not - I think i am going to sell this television and buy a SONY!!!! oh yeah - the customer support ith toshiba was no help either - good luck!
5,I can not wait for it to come out..,"I do hope this collection of mickey mouse cartoons are going to be very entertaining.I am sure they are though.The one cartoon on this collection that I am Particuarly excited about the most is ""The Prince and The Pauper"" because I wanted to purchase it but, they no longer have this video in stores so I have seen it was going to be on this colection and I got Really happy about that.I am sure this will be a delightful Collection of Mickey mouse cartoons."
4,Runaway Brain,"This should be an excellent collection. For the reviewer who stated that ""Runaway Brain"" has never been released for the public, it's almost true.It was released on Super 8 color sound movie film just a few years ago by an English company called ""Derann films"". (You can find them on the internet) Believe it or not, they are still producing new Super 8 film product for people who collect super 8. (surprisingly, it's still going strong.) They have aquired nearly all the animation rights for release of Disney product, with exceptional quality. The other 30 minute long specials starring Mickey from the 80's and 90's are released by them on Super 8 as well."
4,Mickey and Disney,"This is where animation really got started. There were other animation studios doing shorts. It's just Disney's constant striving to raise the bar. And to keep raising it through the years. You'll see why Disney said ""the house that mouse built"".There is more edgy content with the warner brother/MGM bunch but these Disney shorts are quality."
5,Wonderful Vintage Cartoon Collection !,I purchased this DVD set to expand upon my toddler grandsons' current Mickey Mouse DVD collection. The boys ABSOLUTELY LOVE these classic older cartoons. (Mamaw really enjoys watching them too!) I highly recommend this DVD set!
4,Wonderful Mickey!,"Love this collection of Mickey cartoons! Great to watch the evolution of the animation through the decades. Nice to have Mickey's Christmas Carol included. My three year old daughter loves all these cartoons too!! Could do with less of Leonarld Maltin's warnings and the bonus features are not nearly as interesting as the ones included on Looney Tunes Golden collections. Overall, love the videos and was delivered on time and in great shape!!"
4,Very Effective,Used these to mark a trail to a night geocache I made. At night they are extremely easy to see and in the day they can go from invisible to noticable via a maglight. The only complaint Ihave is that for tying they could be a little longer.
1,WRONG CABLE for S3 !!!!!,"Well, as I have a Nikon Coolpix S3, I have to send this back (and, I guess, pay return shipping!) This cable is apparently for the S1 and S2 (not the S3 as stated in the description). Further research shows that I need a UC-E12 USB cable. The photo in the Amazon description wasn't large or clear enough for me to be able to determine that this was the wrong cable; I would like to think Amazon would make certain that their descriptions are correct when they offer an electronic accessory. I tried to give this product 0 stars, but wasn't allowed to do so."
4,"CABLE WAS WRONG, BUT BUYNOW WORKED WITH ME.","The cable in the package was incorrect, BUYNOW made two attempts to correct the problem. they worked with me, and gave a prompt refund. I give them a thumbs-up. I have purchased other things from them and received good service.thanks,clyde"
4,romantic,"Good Movie with storyline that keeps you bound. My husband is not very enthusiastic for teary, romantic movies, but after this one, we have seen many together. Sharon Stone is a brilliant actress and she fit her role well."
5,Impeccable acting and direction,"OK a corny, implausible story but beautifully acted and directed. Even the sound effects of the London Blitz are amazingly accurate -- and I was there. Sharon Stone was brilliant in this much underpraised romance.They were all very good."
3,A gripping plot is what makes this movie so endearing!,"There really are no holes in this entangling story of an American in London, as I found myself trying to find faults within such a complex, even farfetched plot. But that was my own cynicism at work, because it really is a very engrossing movie. It is sentimental and serious at the same time, with Stone's Casey Cantrell trying to piece together her mother's past, bumping into some mysterious questions and a passionate love along the way. This is good romantic entertainment -- not much on the drama side. It is interesting and perhaps even tiresome to see a younger and less experienced Sharon Stone play the role of a young, tentative, yet strong-willed daughter, instead of the vixenish, domineering roles she is known for. Overall, if you can get past reliving 80's fashion (Stone's party dress is a dilly) and standard romance cliches (a whirlwind courtship), this is the quintessential movie for romance-junkies."
5,Very good condition,Very good movie and received in very good condition. I had seen that movie before and I was looking for it but I had forgotten the title.
3,Love This Movie,"I received this movie in the required time..the clarity of the movie is not so great..and it does not have closed caption..but I am still enjoying the movie..Thanks, Amazon"
3,"Poor video quality, great story",I love this movie. I watched it years ago. The video quality is not good at all. It reminded me of watching an old VHS tape. Changing the tv mode to theater improved the video quality enough to make it watchable...but barely.
5,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I SAW THIS MOVIE ON TELEVISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO AFTER IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND.IT'S A TRUE LOVE STORY AND ONE OF SHARON'S BEST MOVIES. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR ITS AVAILABILITY ON DVD. ONE OF MY FAVORITE ROMANTIC FLICKS THAT I CAN VIEW OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I UNFORTUNATELY PURCHASED TWO COPIES OF THIS DVD AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE DVD. THE COLOR WAS INFERIOR. THE DVD WAS POORLY PRODUCED. DO NOT BUY THE DVD VERSION OF THIS MOVIE.
1,Beware of DVD purchases from Regency,"HORRIBLE SOUND; HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY. A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY. RECENTLY PURCHASED AND THROWN AWAY. I HAVE A VHS TAPE OF THE MOVIE THAT I RECORDED FROM TELEVISION MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO. THE TAPE IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE REGENCY DVD. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THAT LICENSEE DISTRIBUTOR. THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED THE MEANING OF ""QUALITY CONTROL"" OR ""PRIDE OF MANUFACTURE"" IN CANADA. STICK TO U.S.-MADE VIDEOS MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE MAJOR STUDIOS LIKE MGM, WARNER HOME VIDEO, PARAMOUNT, COLUMBIA TRISTAR, ETC."
1,Tears in the rain,"I had bought this movie in a store a while back and it is nothing against Sharon Stone because I love her acting but this movie was really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone. If there was a less then ""B-Rated"" on movies this one would be at the top of the list. If you are considering buying it please think twice before you do because it is a real waste of money spent.VLH"
2,Excellent pictures but price is way too high!,Even a serious collector should wait. The pictures are terrific and the figure is good but for the money you would expect allot more from Lucas. The figure could be better for this money. I'd wait until it hit clearance or a sale were it's under $45.00.
2,"Good, but not to good","I was really excited when I got my copy of this limited edition Darth Vader Book. However, as I started reading it, I found that it was nothing that I had expected. I thought that it would have a boigraphy on Anakin Skywalker, and info on his life, with, as it said, some interviews with George Lucas, and others. However, I was happy with some things such as the pictures, which I personally found to be very interesting.....and I also found out some stuff about the creation of the character that I never new, which was interesting. So although I enjoyed the book somewhat, I was dissapointed as it was not to my expectations."
4,"Great figure, decent book","Most people who end up with this set are probably more interested in the Anakin 13.5"" figure than the accompanying book. Anakin is quite nice, with a high level of articulation and a pleasing expression. The book is smaller than you might think from the size of the package. The first section covering the development of the Vader character is interesting reading. The second part is essentially a summation of Vader's role in Episodes 4-6, which is familiar to most everyone. The third is a fairly detailed look at Vader collectibles, which is fun reading for a Star Wars collector, although intense fans may already know about most of it. The presentation is gorgeous throughout, from the massive outer box to the attractive merging of photos and text in the book itself. All in all, a different sort of Star Wars piece well worth picking up."
5,This is a marvelous peice but a little pricey,I think this is a good book and is cool because you get a Anakin Skywalker with it.I think everyone should have this.
5,Best muffin pan I've ever used,"Great 12-cup mini muffin pan. Two fit nicely on one oven shelf (they are just under 8"" wide) with room for hot air to still circulate around them. The handles at both ends are great - the smallness of the pan could easily lead to an oven mitt in the muffins otherwise. In my haste to make my first batch of muffins, I forgot to grease the pan... However, the muffins slid out easily so now I just don't bother greasing the pan at all! Baked muffins are evenly browned. I bought two as I found this is approximately equal to the volume of a regular 12-cup muffin recipe. I would highly recommend this item."
3,Good but not my favorite,"This is a darker pan, which is good if you like your muffins darker. It's excellent for when I'm making darker muffins like chocolate or carrot cake. I've stopped using it for lighter things like corn muffins. With the lighter baked goods, the sides come out a lot browner than the top, and I've had to remove the pan before the tops get as golden brown as I'd like. This can easily be fixed by using it on a higher oven rack, but that's not as convenient because I tend to bake a couple things at once, and all my other pans/tins work perfectly on the middle rack. I have a Sur La Table mini muffin pan as well, and I find that one to be more versatile, and will probably buy another one of those instead. But one thing that is great about the Wilton pan is the extended sides - extra surface area for grasping the pan in and out of the oven."
3,"Good Pan, But the 24-Cup is More Convenient","I have a mini muffin pan that only bakes 12, and another one that bakes 24. The larger pan is by far the more convenient one. My typical muffin recipes seem to make 48 mini muffins. I am planning on getting rid of my smaller pan and replacing it with another large one. Having to bake fewer batches is much more convenient.So, while Wilton's products are quite nice, and my Elite 24 pan completely rocks, I would pass on the small pan and just get a 24 muffin pan."
3,Wonderful guitar but I had an issue,"The guitar is superb, I'm using it with a line 6 spider 4 15 watt amp and it sounds great!!!It did however come without the scratch plate being in screwed in and no screws supplied to complete the job. I ordered some screws and did it myself rather botching the job. Other than that the guitar - from a music perspective is as mentioned before superb."
4,Beautiful Book!,"It is a shame that (currently, anyway) there is no image available for this book. More than the story, which is a simple tale of a pig who learns he must go to sleep to wake up early in order to enjoy the best parts of the day, the adorable and eye-catching illustrations are what really shine. Every page is beautifully embossed, which adds even more life to the sweet drawings. While it may be intended for children ages 4+, my infant son loves to run his hands over the pages and feel the raised textures while I read to him (or even just use the pictures to talk about farm animals). The pages are strengthened, sturdy enough to stand up to his clumsy hands, and thick enough that he can turn the pages as easily as a board book."
5,adorable,love these embossed books! as does our daughter. cute story and the illustrations are fantastic!!
4,Good Product,"This back alarm does a fine job. It's easy to install and plenty loud. I bought it because I drive a van & it's hard to see behind you in a van... especially in parking lots. This is the 2nd one of this type that I've purchased. The first one lasted about 5 years, which isn't bad in the snow, ice & road salt of Pennsylvania."
4,Dragonball Z in High Def,"This disc set includes 2 movies for the price of 1 blu ray disc. Each movie is fairly short, hence the reason why 2 were included. I gave it a 4 star based on these values:1. 2 movies in one disc (+2 stars)2. Hi Definition audio and visual (+2 stars)It loses 1 star for the following reason: Cropping and not being ""True High Def"" This movie was not originally shot in HD therefore the movie was upscaled. Also, original format was in 4:3, not in 16:9 so there are shots that are cut off, though I do not mind but for viewers and the review this can be an annoyance.Overall I am pleased with the transition. Also, watching Dragonball Z in high def made all the difference for me, so it merits a purchase, unless you already own the movies on DVD."
3,WEAK!! WEEEEEeeeAK!!!!!!,"Yes the picture is good enough for the film being shown. Japanese anime movies reach this amount of clarity back in the '90s and back. But the supplements were horrid -Being that there's sqwat!- and the menu was rather lacking. I love the old DVD menus that don't give you a long turgid animated ride before actually showing the menu (I'm looking at you, mr. bond!) but this one screamed CHEEP! Oh, yes. If you like Dragon Ball, this is for you."
4,Enlightening and packed,"This book is full of great and interesting ways to accentuate your health and well being. Although you might want to really delve deeper with other volumes, this one is a great and diverse reference for asian health techniques."
5,Excellent read!!!,"This book is absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe all the interesting things I learned with this book. Acupressure, survival situations, self-defense, and even diet ideas like juice fasting or nutritious recipes, were complimented by detailed drawings and humor. This book explains the best beauty treatments, the best ways to aid certain ailments and sicknesses, the best ways to prepare and store food. There is something for anyone who picks this book up. No matter where in the world you live. I would definitely recommend the book, whether it be just a handy guide around the house or a great gift idea."
5,Unbelieveable!!!,"I'm a bit of a skeptic, yet this is the most useful book I have ever read. I now can make my own skin care items, perform cpr, calm myself through yoga and acupressure. I found hints to raise my children non-voilently and how to protect myself if I happen to find myself in a dangerous position. Zeek is absoutly extrodinary! This book combines great writing with great humor at the same time. The pictures are amazing so detailed and artistic. The diagrams are easy to use. I can't imagine anyone not finding something in this book that pertains to them. There are beauty secrets, heatlh secrets, many travelling tips and secrets. There are so many its hard to list them all. I will be using this book as a reference for many years to come!!!"
2,"Sorry, Not Impressed.","I have a few ""Survival Guides"", not because I'm an explorer or outdoorsman, I just think they're interesting. I picked this one up for the content, not the art. Although the art is impressive, I found the information in ""The Art Of Shen Ku"" a little to New Age for my tastes. Lots of things I really wanted to dig deeper into are barely mentioned and other stuff I have no interest in were covered in detail over several pages. I personally don't believe in the holistic and other herbal solutions to life's problems, but apparently Zeek does. Sorry, I know 95% of the reviews are glowing and 5 stars, but I just didn't find it that interesting or helpful."
3,Quirky and fun!,"A fun, quirky book with little bits of information about everything and anything from information about the use of herbs to accupressure to how to keep children entertained(!).The illustrations are wonderfully detailed and the how-to pics are somehow instructionally explicit and simple to follow without being cluttered and illegible.Part comic book, part philosophy, part mystery, and all fun. Don't take it too seriously, but enjoy the ride!"
3,Strange,"I bought this book after leafing through it in the book store. Seemed interesting. Got it home and opened it a few times, read some stuff then put it down. I reopened it today and found it has some useful information - a lot of it but how much of it will I ever need. I am not a traveler so all I can say is - I wish I still had my [...] bucks instead of the book. Bottom line a lot of time went into the book and if you are into holistic stuff you may find it to be very helpful. Me, I'm on the fence with the holistic approach - nothing has ever worked for me but I know people who have had success."
5,One of the most useful books I ever bought,"I got introduced to this book by a girlfriend's husband who was glued to the pages the entire weekend they were visiting. My own husband finally snatched it away from him, only to instantly become totally absorbed in it himself. Our friends had to pry it out of his hands when they left. I subsequently bought him and my two brothers each a copy of it and they haven't put it down yet! Curious now, I've even started reading it myself and find it one of the handiest reference books for travellers I've ever seen."
5,An amazing compendium of useful and entertaining info,"From knots to medicinal herbs to yoga postures, this book contains an amazing range of information. Some--or much-- of the information is a bit esoteric, but that adds a mystic touch. I find something new in it every day. I keep mine in a basket in the bathroom (next to my own book about composting toilets)---however, this has resulted in houseguests ""disappearing"" for long periods in my bathroom."
1,It's a castle BUILT ON SAND...,"There is no doubt that this book had a lot of time, effort, and creativity spent on it, however a good deal of the information in the book is wrong.It may be delivered in a ""cool and interesting"" format, however it doesn't matter how grand you build the castle, if you build it on sand. There is so much information in the book that has been proved incorrect. I finally stopped flipping through the book when I read where it says coconut oil is bad for you and will clog your arteries, etc. Coconut oil is good for your body and arteries!So anyway... if the artist who cartooned the book teamed up with a disciplined and accurate scientist I think we would have something quite valuable.. but until then... you may be filling your mind with easily digestible, but bad, information.Time to return the book. Best of luck next time."
1,bad comic book,"this book was highly recommended to me by a friend who swears by it. after reading it, or browsing through it really, i have no idea why he said such good things about it. it's a big comic book that isnt funny and is full of unneccessary information. i wouldnt recommend it to anyone for any reason. don't listen to the 5 star reviews"
1,Junk - Just a comic book,I bought this as a gift due to the reviews. All I got was a comic book written by someone at a high-school level of thinking. Be suspicious of the positive reviews. I'll try to return this book - or I'll throw it out.
5,"Pay attention, this will count for 75% of your final grade","In as few words as possible, The Art of Shen Ku is .... a comic book from God. An owner's manual for anything carbon-based. Jackie Chan's cookbook. ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" as written by Leonardo Da Vinci. Etc., ad infinitum, ad nauseum.But all true.Impressive.I challenge anyone to open this book, and not go home with it."
5,The Art of Shen Ku,"This book is the definitive guide to the world. You name it and you can find it inside. This book keeps you searching for more. I was once a firm believer in a book entitled ""The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies II"" but Shen Ku has changed all that. This ""how to"" book addresses everything from strength training to ways to beat common allergies. Shen Ku enables the pedestrian to conquer life's unknowns with ease and confidence. Page after page outlines invaluable information that those of all ages, and all walks of life can benefit from. For those interested in a ""one-stop"" all encompassing guide, I highly recommend The Art of Shen Ku."
2,"Maybe it's me, but the Duck ain't funny!","With excellent animation, Disney must've cut back on his gag writing budget, because Donald Duck solo just isn't that funny, pretty much a one joke pony.The shorts with Donald, Mickey and Goofy together are classics, as the different characters play off each other, or react with their own personalities to the same situation, without having to carry an entire cartoon. For laugh out loud funny cartoons, I prefer Warner Bros. or Tex Avery MGM shorts (yeah, when are THOSE coming out on DVD?). BTW, I did enjoy the DD toons on the WWII set more than these..."
4,GREAT collection!,"Fantastic collection! Sharp picture.Leonard Maltin is the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. He is rediculously annoying. However, in this DVD, unlike the Volume 2, you can skip and fast forward his blab. Also unlike Volume 2, he talks for a few seconds BEFORE each possibly offensive cartoon. But like I said, you can use your handy dandy skip button and go strait to the next cartoon.I did learn something from him though. In Disney's paranoia not to offend anyone, they had him explain all the little cultural things that would go over our heads in this day and age. In one cartoon Pluto is wrestling with a spring and it gets stuck on his neck. Aparently that was supposed to represent an African neck band. I never got that until Leonard Maltin put that idea in my head. Maybe I should write to Disney and tell them how insulted I am ;)"
5,The best Disney character of all time,"By my title you should be able to guess that Donald Fauntleroy Duck is my favorite Disney character. While he is quick-tempered and often violent, his short war-time films and those with Chip 'n' Dale are among the best cartoons ever produced. I can't say enough ""thanks"" to Leonard Maltin for his ability to get these released. I only hope that there will be a volume two in the future. For those who are sorely disappointed by the garbage running all day, every day on the cartoon network or Nickelodeon, you won't be disappointed by any animated short that features Donald Duck!"
2,look some place else,when i ordered this it came but one side was broken. no sound came out of the left side. it kind of pops out and its not worth it
1,NOT GREAT,"When I bought these is was worth $1.29 I got it as cheap and now the price is up, I don't know why. It is worst than Ipod headphones. Those volume control on the picture is useless, because even thought you put to the highest, it is little bit louder, but not loud enough. Its not a headphone you want to get."
5,Simply Amazing!!!,"Rift Zone is simply amazing!!! It draws you in right from the beginning, and is one wild ride from then on, full of twists and turns. Just try and put this one down. Hillhouse does an excellent job of bringing the different cities and the politics that drive them to life, in a style that is both witty and intelligent. I am a big Tom Clancy fan and would highly recommend Rift Zone for anyone who enjoys his novels or adventure stories in general. I am eagerly awaiting the next novel by Hillhouse."
2,A Cisco Documentation Cut and Paste!,"Sorry to dispute all the other reviewers, but I spend some time with the Cisco Documentation and found that this book is almost entirely a ""cut and paste"" effort from Cisco Documentation. I found entire areas that were merely ""pasted"" into the book and others (e.g. Chapter 7 & 8 on VLANs) where the material was simply repeated from the previous chapter word-for-word.No effort was made by this author to edit or explain the Cisco concepts. I always thought a book like this would contain explanatory material - but alas it was not to be!Since I have yet to take the test, I can't comment on the substance of the material -- but only on the fact that I could have obtained the same material -- verbatim -- from Cisco's site. Too bad!"
3,victim of the course material,"The problem with this book isn't so much the content as it is the course material itself.Passing the CLSC test proves absolutely nothing about one's knowledge of switching, all it really tests you on is whether you can memorize and spit out marketing brochures and propoganda from Cisco. In fact, this test is much like any Microsoft test, which is a big disappointment coming from Cisco.If you want to get your CCNP right away, this book is probably the best preparation on the market; otherwise wait for BCMSN material to come out so you can actually learn something useful.Or read the CCIE Cisco Lan Switching book, which is easily the best book on switching in the market."
3,NOT the definitive guide (on the measurement of ultrashort laser pulses),"This book covers a wide variety of FROG methods, which is just one method of complete characterization. This book does NOT give an unbiased viewpoint and does not give the shortcomings of other techniques. The author writes in a supposedly jovial manner, which is refreshing at first but soon becomes annoying and is often used to mask his one-sided viewpoint.The background material is basic but sufficient to understand how FROG works. Many, but not all, FROG variants are covered. Many different classes of pulses are considered, giving a good flavour of the power of the method. If you work with ultrafast pulses, then I strongly recommend this book. However, also consider alternative methods by reviewing the literature (unfortunately there is no book because the researchers are busy using the devices in experiments)."
3,Helpful... to a point,"I just got back from a medical mission trip to Mexico and this book was great for initial questions. But this isn't good for the details of problems, especially neurological problems and gastrointestinal. Frequently I ran out of questions and had to use a translator to finish my H&P which whas frustrating for me and the patient. Fortunately, by the end of the week my Spanish was much better and I had memorized the translator's phrases so that I didn't use this book as much. It does fit nicely in scrub or white coat pockets."
1,Waste of money...,"I should have listen to the previous reviews as this pocket manual being rather worthless. Because indeed it is worthless, while it is divided into specialty sections, there's translations of common questions and uncommon questions, but not enough info to obtain even a simple history. I would suggest people looking for a span-eng dict. invest in something more thorough even if it is a little bulkier in the pocket.Most of what was included in this pocket guide could have easily been obtained from just asking spanish speaking personel in the workplace."
4,Helpful,I have found this booklet helpful in my practice. The phrases are well arranged by category. Big bonus - the words/phrases are spelled (with bold accents) e-x-a-c-t-ly how they are pronounced! Would have given all 'stars' if l & d included some recovery/postpartum teaching.
4,Great little reference,"This book may be small, but it is FULL of information. Plus, it is the perfect size to carry in your pocket when you need to have it on hand. I recommend this book highly for anyone in the medical profession who needs some Spanish, but doesn't have time for classes."
1,A waste of money,"I paid ten dollars, including P and P, for a pamphlet. It is worth one tenth of that cost. It was a real disappointment to me. In the description, it is referred to as a paperback. This is not a paperback (book). I would have liked to be informed that it is a leaflet before having bought it."
1,There are very few female sleuths I actively dislike,", unfortunately I must add Amanda Pepper to that short list. She is hands down the dumbest sleuth I've ever come across.She's weak and stupid and whiny and stultifying. I'm surprised she's lived as long as she has, I actually wanted the villain to kill her. Maybe, just maybe this was an aberration of Roberts' writing, but I can't take that chance again. I don't have that kind of time. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and I found this book torturous."
4,"Great toy, but a bit tricky to do the tracks for a 3 year old.","My 3 year old son has fun with it, but is unable to play with it on his own. I am constantly fixing the tracks for him."
2,WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY TOO SHORT!!!,"This game was a blast to play. The models and graphics were a little simplistic, but overall, the gameplay was easy enough to pick up. The story was top notch, thanks to Orson Scott Card. And the varied environments were fresh and fun. And kudos to Tommy Tallarico for the soundtrack.But I beat the game in 24 hours. I NEVER beat a game in 24 hours. I am not that dedicated a gamer. This is terribly upsetting. This is part 1 of a trilogy of games. They should have waited to finish the other 2 games and released them as one.WAYTOOSHORT!"
2,Advent Rising,"Decent game, but didn't make the port very well. It has some weird graphical hiccups at times and is way too short for the price. I enjoy playing it, but not enough that I'm glad I bought it."
5,Great book,It was one of the best works he ever did and I love his books they rock I would say he writes the best books ever
3,"Not as good as Holes, but not bad at all","I read a couple of Louis Sachar's books when I was young (Sixth Grade Secrets (Apple Paperbacks),There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom (Cascades)). After reading (and loving)Holesseveral years ago, I decided to read some of his other books.This one is much simpler and shorter than Holes, with a younger reading level, but it is still a fun story (with a fair amount of serious elements) and a quick (if somewhat predictable) read. I like that the reason given for Angeline's genius is that she can remember things she's known since before her birth."
5,The Final Album - The Ultimate Best Of (2003),"..""The Final Album - The Ultimate Best Of"" is their 13th album.It contains all their greatest Hits 1984-1987, 1998-2003.If you are not their fan, but want to know what their Hits are, then this CD is a ""must-have"" for you!.."
2,Nuncrackers,I ordered this to add to my collection. It was ok. Not as good as Nunsense. Kind of slow. It has a few good songs.
3,"""Mt. St. Helen's version of the Nutcracker""","Thank the Deity, someone had the good ""nunsense"" to bring back the original Sr. Mary Paul and Rue McClanahan. What happened to Srs. Robert Ann, Mary Leo, and Mary Hubert? Though cute and entertaining, the original cast is still the best. In addition. let Sr. Amnesia take care of Sr. Mary Annette, the puppet. If you're a Nunsense fan, I'd recommend buying it, but beware, it's not as good as 1 and 2."
4,Nun Lovers Unite!!!,"I must admit, I have a weird obsession with nuns. Indeed I do. It started a year and a half ago, in the 7th grade. When my best friend gave me this for Christmas, I was thrilled. The musical numbers are creative, the sketches are hilarious, and the jokes are, well, good. As a Golden Girls fan (that's another thing, I really like elderly women) I was pleased with Rue's performance as Sister Mary Regina. I die when I hear ""We Three Kings of Orient Are Us"", come very close to wetting myself when Father Virgil dresses up like Sister Julia (Child of God), and almost popped a blood vessel when I saw John Ritter narate Mount St. Helen's production the The Nutcracker. Even St. Amnesia was pleasing, especially by giving to those in need.PS- I <3 Sister Mary Annette"
5,"A lucid, informative biography","After all the angry attacks that followed Bettelheim's death and after the unmerited smearing of his reputation as a thinker, it is a relief to read his balanced biography. Raines wrote book worthy of its subject, a book that does justice to Bettelheim as an educator and therapist. The book does not delve into many details of Bettelheim's private life and because of that is very cogent. On the other hand, none of the important events are omitted, none of the difficulties and contradictions glossed over. The portrait that emerges is of a man who, like Maria Montessori and Janusz Korczak, transformed his own personal tragedy into a life-restituting effort for those who are most vulnerable: children. A most helpful book to read for anyone who would like to understand Bettelheim's attitude to children is ""A Good Enough Parent."""
3,Tastes fine for the price,"I wanted a green tea that's a) organic, b) doesn't cost a fortune and c) has a clearly listed caffeine count and this first the bill. The tastes is weak but inoffensive. Quite frankly I see green tea as a healthy caffeine delivery system as opposed to a delicious beverage, so this works for me. Not sure I'd buy again but happy enough with my purchase."
5,Wonderful Flavor,"I just tried a box of this tea recently and really loved it flavor! I never thought I was an Earl Grey tea lover let alone a fan of black teas. But this tea has changed my mind about both completely. Now I am a fan of both black tea and Earl Grey tea.I like that Revolution uses whole tea leaves in each tea bag. I also love the taste of lavender, but it does have a strong taste to it, so lavender must be used sparingly. Frankly, I was concerned that this particular tea would taste overwhelmingly of lavender, but to my delight the lavender taste was very subtle and delicate and it complimented the Earl Grey tea nicely. I will most definitely try this tea again."
5,Great tea for the money,"Great tea for the price. I wouldn't consider it to be a true gourmet tea, but it's great to keep in the pantry for every day use."
5,Great price for great ea!,If you have not tried this you will love it! Great price as well! Can't beat it!
1,very disappointed in the nylon bags,"Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags? This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them. The company told me they wee FDA approved, but the FDA is only worried about things that will kill you in the short run, or that have very high levels of dangerous chemicals. Trace amounts are permitted. Considering how much tea I drink, I'd rather not add toxins to my body every single time.In contrast Might Leaf, while they have similar looking tea bags, theirs are not nylon and are biodegradable in addition to not being dangerous.Very disappointed in this product. They should at least have been upfront about the nylon bags so concerned people can avoid buying them."
5,Great Full Leaf Organic Green Tea,"I've been on a cancer study diet that requires multiple cups of green tea a day ever since 1998. During the past 11 years I've tasted a tremendous amount of brands and varieties of green tea. Revolution's Organic Full Leaf Green Tea is by far my favorite. It is mild, yet has a rich, slightly sweet flavor. It's never bitter. My youngest daughter has always told me that whole leaf teas are much more flavorful and just better in every way. After tasting Revolution's whole leaf green tea, I'd have to agree with her."
4,CT Sherri,My friends and I have enjoyed this kind of tea at a resturant called P.F.Changs and I found it at a local store but much better prices at Amazon. I am enjoying it for icetea as well as hot tea. Very good tea. I split the order with a friend who also liked it and wanted some.
5,Wonderful tea,Great aroma and fine taste. I am so happy with Amazon's subscribe and save price on this. This is our household's favorite. I wish I could find this in loose tea format.
3,okay,Tea is okay but it's more of a peach flavor than ginger peach. I couldn't taste/smell the ginger at all.
2,Makes a weak cup of tea,"I was so excited to find Lavender Earl Grey since I had enjoyed a delicious one in the past, but this brand makes a very weak cup of tea. Maybe next time I will get a high quality loose leaf Earl Grey and add my own lavender."
2,Lavender tea is o.k.,I've had much better lavender earl grey albeit at a higher price point. This was a bit disappointing.
1,This is NOT Earl Grey,"Revolution makes a green Earl Grey tea but this item is mislabelled.This is a fine Green Tea but it is not Earl Grey.I ordered 6 so now I am stuck with something I did not want.This is the second time this has happened to me with Amazon.Another time I ordered what was described as ""12 Packs of Coffee Filterswith 40 each."" I received one and Amazon told me it was a misprint.No compensation was offered.Amazon needs a proof reader or needs to stand behind the descriptionsof items they sell."
2,strong caffeinated tea,"I had ordered this set thinking it was the decaf sweet ginger peach one served at PF Changes. I was wrong and instead got over 60 bags of strongly caffeinated tea. The shape is great for a teapot, but awkward for a single cup of tea."
2,"This is NOT EARL GREY in any way, shape, or form...","It's good tea, from a good manufacturer. However, Amazon REALLY needs to re-label this. It is ORGANIC GREEN TEA, with no bergamot, meaning, IT IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EARL GREY green tea. It's just plain green tea. I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back as a return, so now I have 96 bags of plain green tea to go through.So, if you want good organic green tea, go with this. If you want earl grey, take heed, and don't buy this. This was my first disappointment with Amazon."
1,o expensive,you can buy lipton for less than 4.00 / 6 oz and 6oz at dollar generasl for 1.00. they dont have anything special. green tea is tea that hasn't been ferminted to make it taste bitter. green tea is great and cheap and so is tomatoe juice : )
5,The best tea in the world,"This is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. Even my young daughter and grand-daughter just love this super duper tea. Has full body, very favorable, doesn't need sugar to give it a rich flavor."
5,super,"Initially I was overwhelmed by the uber flavor of this tea. But it has really become my very favorite by far. Beyond all the health benefits to the particular way this tea is fermented.....the packaging is ultra convenient. THe resealable aluminum pouch and the tea bags have no tags or strings, so it is very easy to dump 6 in a big pot for ice tea. Tried the others...this is the best to me"
5,Best Mint Tea,Honestly I drink a lot of tea and I love mint tea but it is hard to find good mint where you can actually taste the flavor. Revolution Mint Tea is by the best!!!
1,Beware - ingredients not just tea!!,"My husband, who never suffers from any allergies, went into anaphylactic shock after consuming this tea. The ingredients show many other herbs and flowers other than tea and flavoring. He remembered that his fingertips were itchy seconds after handling the bag. So if you have never tried this product, handle the bag in your hand for a few minutes before steeping in water. If your going to have a severe reaction you'll soon see some irritation on your skin."
4,"Great tea, not so great shelf life","I LOVE this tea. Then again, I love lavender. It is a great tasting, incredible smelling quality tea. What I don't love is an expiration date only 6 months away when other lots I purchased do not expire for 1 1/2 yrs. I wish I knew the shelf life on my packages prior to purchasing but its a gamble. I guess I'll just drink up!"
5,My favorite tea!,"I was so excited to find this tea on Amazon and with subscribe and save to top it off! This Lavender Earl Grey tea is so hard to find in stores and is not an inexpensive tea. A much better buy on Amazon to buy in bulk and so convenient to have it shipped right to my house and often within 2 days! And to think I used to have to LOOK for this tea all over the place! I buy 6 boxes at a time on Amazon and I also buy the loose Earl Grey tea (I think Davidsons?) on Amazon too. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!"
4,Really good Tea,"I really like this tea for a couple of reasons. First, it tastes awesome, no need for sugar with this one. Also, it comes in a really nice mesh bag so you just drop it in and steep. I never like those old white tea bags with the stapled string attached. Very refreshing. Well worth the price. I keep a stock of this tea all the time and when I feel under the weather, it's the one I go for."
5,Revolution Tea ~ Sweet Ginger Peach Tea,"I LOVE this tea! I have been buying this tea for almost a year, now. When for some ridiculous reason I couldn't find it locally anymore, I turned to Amazon for my tea fix :o) ... I drink it every day just about all day ~ All of the flavors are almost perfectly blended together, there is nothing over powering another flavor and just enough of a hint of a 'sweet' (so taste it before you add any honey or sweetener). The pyramid tea bag is fantastic - not only can see the contents clearly, but it allows for a much better cup of tea ... I've tried some of the other flavors ~ I like the White Pear, the Dragon Oolong, Love the English Breakfast (a full bodied tea - love it!) - Golden Chamomile is okay (to be fair, I like white teas a lot and black teas similar to their Sweet Ginger Peach and English Breakfast) ..."
5,This is absolutely the best caffeine free herbal tea I have ever had!!!,"My sister gave me a tea bag that she purchased at a convenience store, I fell in love with the sweet favor (so soothing). I wanted more but could not find a store in my area that sold it by the box so I had to order it, but it is well worth it."
5,nice looked mean,looks great but you get all the wind all it is is for looks thats it but it looks good
1,He Tried,"Handling this Da Vinci Code issue is tricky. One must find the right balance of response, rebuttle, commentary, and fact-offering. Sadly, Lunn missed the mark. Here's why.What other books has Martin Lunn writtern?-none. And it shows. The guy clearly knows a lot about history, but when it comes to getting his point across, his rookie status as a writer really shows. Also, Lunn doesn't seem able to grasp what the average reader (a.k.a. Dan Brown fan) really wants to know. More than anything else, I felt like I was reading a tour guide to Europe when I read this book, instead of reading a real thoughtful response to Brown's bestseller. This may be because Lunn lives in Barcelona.The book's PR description says Lunn's volume ""provides an exhaustive tour of the locations visited by the novel's characters."" Very true-I was exhausted by reading the book. I would rather have closed the last page enlightened with a few really interesting facts on which to hang my thoughts."
2,Just Read the Da Vinci Code,"What a joke! This book was obviously rushed into print to capitalize on the Dan Brown phenomenon, but it is nothing more than a recap of the research presented by Brown - much of which is questionable.Martin Lunn claims to be an historian, but he falls into the same traps as many of the ""historians"" on which Dan Brown relied for his own research, making wild leaps of logic and mortaring historical gaps with assumption and preconception.For Brown, this was fine; he was writing fiction. But Lunn claims to be telling the ""truth"" - a truth no one can possibly know after two millenia of obfuscation. So what Lunn ACTUALLY does is recount Dan Brown's research without all of that confusing ""plot"" and none of those annoying ""characters"". If you want to know the contents of Martin Lunn's book, read Dan Brown and at least be entertained while you do it."
1,The worst of conspiracy buffs,"After reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" I was interested to learn about the questions it brings up. I bought 2 books: the conservative debunker ""The DVC: Fact or Fiction?"" by Hanegraaff and Maier and this book. I read the Hanegraaff book first and thought it was rather unreliable because it's main argument seemed to be, ""Because the Bible says so."" Then I read ""DVC Decoded"" and was amazed at how inept and ridiculous Lunn is. His willingness to go along with any theory, no matter how preposterous, made me yell out ""Come on!"" more than a few times. Unsatisfied with either book, I got Burstein's ""Secrets of the Code"" and can not recommend it enough. Its balanced, intelligent essays represent a thorough and stimulating discussion of the popular Dan Brown book."
2,"So-so, but not too bad","I'll keep this short.Pro - secular treatment, good price, covers most of the issuesCon - too expensive, too long, a bit too secular (no sense of respect for spirituality AT ALL), too wordy (rambles a bit), uses dry vocabulary.Recommendation - Fine for those who want a long read. Those who want a scholarly Christian approach should go with Bock. But those who want more popular (but well-documented) approach should go for Abanes -- ""The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code."""
1,A surprising bit of fiction,As I read this book I found myself surprised that anyone could actually take scholarship of this degree seriously.Truly a book that only a conspiracy theorist could love.
3,It's ok but there are many other Mecano's hits missing,"It actually has only 9 songs/videos in this dvd, some of them are old so the image quality is not the best because they were made at the end of the 80's and begining of 90's. Ana Torroja has one of the most wonderful voices I've heard, Some of the videos are very surrealistics.Many other good songs missing. it has: La Fuerza del Destino,Hijo de la luna(Spanish and Italian version)No hay Marcha en NY,Mujer contra mujer,Aidalai(images and recording sessions fragments of the album),Dalai Lama,El siete de Septiembre,Naturaleza muerta,Figlio Della Luna"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"I will never buy another Intex pool. I filled it with air for the first time yesterday. My boys used it for a couple hours and one day later the whole pool is flat. The bottom ring was the first to go. I have only owned one other inflatable pool(different name brand), but we used it for 3 summers. I believe there is another pool that is very similar to this one that Intex is trying to sell which is green. I read where someone had the same problem with that pool."
5,Great Value Pool,"I bought this pool last summer from this site and we love it. It is a great size for kids to play in and even for adults to kick back and relax. Last Fall I drained it and stored it in a trashbag, I'm using the same pool again this summer. The other reviews state that it is cheaply made but I have had no problem with it with proper care. If you place it in the rocks than it probably wont last long but mine has lasted for two summers in the sandy part of my lawn. It is a little difficult to drain on its own due to the plug constantly closing and the weight of the pool constricting the opening. If you place a pool toy under the drain hole between the pool and the ground it will drain much faster. I have let it sit unkept for awhile and it filled with green goo but it cleaned up with a waterhose and a quick sweep with a broom. This year we put chlorine and shock in it and we haven't had to change the water yet. I would buy this pool again and have gifted it to several friends."
3,Rimmer's Tangent,"This book will only be of interest to fans of RHR's books. It is only tangentially related to the Harrad Experiment which it precedes. Still, it is a good read and may be of interest to those now looking at gold as a good money management or investment tool."
5,Go Bunnies Go!,"My 3 year old son loves this book. The story is easy to follow and has that repetitive style that small children love. The battle between the sneeky bunnies and Mr McGreely is great, and builds to a very amusing ending. I have read this story every night now for the past 3 months and I am sure that I will be reading it for at least another 3 - Muncha, Muncha, Muncha!"
5,Thank you Cheerios!,"Like another reviewer, I bought this hardback only after getting a copy out of the Cheerios box. My son really enjoys this book and so do I! I like the illustrations and the creative bunnies! I recently read this to my preschool class and they all enjoyed it as well.Tippy tippy tippy pat. Muncha! Muncha! Muncha!"
2,Muncha Muncha noise & not much else,"The flow of the book is very disjointed, jumping from narrative to sound effects with no explanation for the listener. So, younger children may not easily follow the story line without the reader stopping to explain that, ""And the sun went down. And the moon came up. And - Tippy tippy tippy pat, Dive-paddle, Splash! Splash! Splash! Dig-scrabble, Scratch! Scratch! Scratch! spring-hurdle Dash! Dash! Dash! Muncha Muncha Muncha!"" means that the rabbits tip-toed to the garden, jumped into a moat, swam across it, climbed over a wall, jumped over a fence and ate the vegetables. The illustrations are cute but again, (for younger listeners) don't lead the children through the story very well. It's an empty story with not much other than pesky rabbits and a weekend gardener who attempts to find new ways to keep the rabbits from eating his vegetables."
4,"Excellent documentary, a must see prior to celebrity","Woody Allen is a tortured soul. Except when he is playing the clarinet. For some inexplicable reason he can be transported and forget the miseries of daily existance. See this movie, which tracks Allen and Sun-Yi throughout Europe on their 1997 New Orleans Jazz Band tour. See how he really handles ""celebrity"" The music is fun, but it's the personal moments that Barbara Kopple captures that make this film so watchable. It's hard to see what Allen sees i his new mate, but he is inscrutible, and funny as always in this film. Then again there is an undercurrent of misery here that helps explain the opening and final shots of ""HELP"" seen in his new film."
2,Mr. Ego with talentless companion,"This movie shows Allen, of whom I've been a huge fan for many years, not as a tortured sole, but as a spoiled child. Artist's supposedly need chaos and disharmony for inspiration, but flying around in your own jetplane while your band is in a bus, and then later feeling guilted by this does not equate to the stuff art/comedy/drama is made of...this film highlights Allen's selfishness, and his companion/wife is a bore...posing as some fraction of a pseudo-intellectual, saying nothing challenging to the well-read 62 year old child...its hard to believe this is his muse. Yet, he did have the guts to let this ugly side of him be displayed (again) to the world...and there is something masochistically enteraining about watching this brilliant man sign his autograph for a fan as if this were annoying WORK yet put on the phony celebrity face to brush the fan off...perhaps a metaphor us all."
4,"Music, fun, and an interesting look at being a celebrity","If you like music and Woody Allen, you will love this endearing documentary by Barbara Kopple. Go behind the scenes as Woody, Soon-Yi, and his band go on a European tour. Allen's wit and quirky but charming personality expose him for the humble and intelligent man he is. But, oy...his mother!"
5,"Very Good, but not enough inclusion of the band by Allen.","This documentary film flowed very nicely...but, would have been more interesting if they would have touched on the lives of each band member...only one band member seemed to be hilighted, the banjo player...wondered about the rest of the band and where they were in the travels of the entourage...how they met and perceived Woody Allen would have been a nice touch to complete the ensemble."
3,IT's okay,One set of bearings spins longaer and fast than the other side. Their quality contral department needs some work.
1,"Same Old Thing, But Less Of It","This was going to be the only book I was going to buy after Diana's death, since I have been collecting books, etc. written about her since 1981. I bought it, read it, and found it to be so incredibly out-dated and full of lies (pre-Andrew Morton bulemia confession, etc.) that I returned it to the store to get my money back."
5,Mystery with a Southern Flair,"Well-written, beautifully descriptive, heartwarming and funny, suspenseful. Can't wait for the sequel"
2,I just didn't love it,"I'm hesitant to give low review to any author but felt compelled to do so because I was so disillusioned by the other reviews.I kept waiting for something to happen in this novel and when it did, I was disappointed. It seemed that the entire book was written for the ""surprise"" ending which was overly dramatic and too unrealistic to be believable.Then again, I had just read Francine Rivers' ""Redeeming Love"" and not much compares to that, now does it?"
4,My 3 Year Old LOVES this one,"Personally, I find the sing-along songs format a bit dull, and especially do not care for the fact that Disney is recycling MUCH older songs into these videos...but, my youngest son absolutely loves the Lion King, and he adores this video. He says that the whole Lion King movie has some parts that scare him but that he loves to sing the songs without the scary parts. And, having listened to/watched this tape with him at least once a day for the past month or so, I can say that there are MANY worse things your young child could be watching. Max rates this a perfect 5; I rate it a 3, so we are compromising on 4 stars."
4,FINALLY!!!,Finally a fresh take on RTS games! No words can describe this game! Its a shame they never made a sequal to it. Its fun but skirmish games can last hours before you completely upgrade everything and produce your most powerful units. The graphics are pretty good depending on the what detail you have them set at. Runs on my Laptop w/ Windows 7. I would reccomend for any Dino Fan.
4,Fun at a low price,"I saw this product selling for $5 the other day, but it's as much fun as any $30 RTS. It combines smart AI for worker units to allow you to take your attention off resource gathering with stunning graphics. It is truly beautiful to watch, and awe-inspiring to play; prehistoric units are anatomically correct and everything moves realistically. With a campign mode that runs like an adventure movie and skirmish battles for those wanting to get into the action immediately, this is one of the best RTSs for the PC that I have ever played"
2,The CD is flawed,"There is a flaw in the CD at about the 30 sec mark of Sleeper's Awake. Since it is this version of the piece that I liked and the reason I bought the CD, I'm very disappointed."
1,"Too Big, and VERY rough","I'm surprised that my review is so different than everyone elses. I thought that these were probably the least comfortable sheets I have ever slept on. Even my husband who is not very picky about his sheets asked if we could take them off after the first night. I felt like if I moved my legs too quickly I almost got a ""rug burn"" sensation. I have an extra deep mattress and the fitted sheet was way too big. We were swimming in them all night. Very disappointed."
5,Best Ever,"These are the best sheets I've ever owned. Not only are they long enough to tuck in, the width is also generous so I don't have to fight my hubby for the covers to stay warm. They are soft and smooth and allow me to turn over in the night without 'grabbing' at my PJ's. These sheets provide a great night sleep."
4,Elastic on Fitted Sheets,"Hello,I have a flat sheet from this line that I love. Can anyone tell me if the elastic on the fitted sheets is all the way around, just on two sides or just on the corners? Thank you for your help."
4,The Contents Are Not What is Presented in the Synopsis,"When I saw this book I said ""Oh goodie, ancient ghost stories."" That is not what this book is about. This is clearly someone's Classics MA Thesis or PhD Dissertation on ghost stories. It is very analytical, and would not be of general interest to those who just want a good ghost story. For anyone interested in the literary construct and corresponding religious connotations of Greek and Roman ghosts stories, this is a great read."
5,Can't live without this!,"Crazy hot and a powder... nothing really like it out there, and I love the flavor and the intense heat."
4,"Decent book, great price","The book took a little while to arrive, but it was in the specified condition and you can't beat the $50, give or take, that you save from not buying on campus."
1,not sturdy and not safe!,"I purchased this gate on a sale event and tried to put it in my kitchen. However, this gate is absolutely not sturdy and easy to fall even with a light push. It can't lock very well because the adjustable feature is poorly designed where you can only adjust to ""certain"" position but not ""all."" I tried to fit it around the stairs and it doesn't work. Simply speaking, it doesn't work in any entrance of my house. I returned the item the next day. Please consider another gate if you are looking for a secure one."
2,It's okay only if you have dogs.,It is very hard to lock and more recommended for dogs than babys. It also falls easily. Don't buy it unless you want your babys to run away.
4,From Six-Principle General Association,"Knight's book presents an excellent historical perspective on one of America's most important yet under-appreciated denominations in general and Baptist denominations in particular. Knight presents an excellent, in-depth commentary on the six principles of Hebrews 6:1-2. Recommended reading for any Baptist historian."
1,Dangerous Chemicals in product can lead to health problems,"I was researching reviews on the Aveeno Soothing Relief Creamy Wash and I came across one that mentioned it had dangerous chemicals in it. I looked even further into the product and came across this website that had a list of common baby products with these dangerous chemicals. It says that the chemicals in some of these products can lead to health problems. On the website, this product was included on the list! I ordered this for my son before I found out about the chemicals and I plan on returning it as soon as I recieve it. I will not be using this for him!The website is[...]"
4,A Star product,I am using these new tower speakers for my sterio audio only and am very satisfied with the sound. I find the imaging and crispness to my liking and have just enough bass without the extra middle speaker. These were a happy choice of speakers for my use.
3,not as advertised!!!,"Do not refer to the picture of this product. There are no floor stands, only wall mounts.And the phone rep promised to resend with proper stands......not!!Also promised to inspect box Before shipment.....not!!!Both arrived poorly packaged and beat up."
1,"nice speakers, bad purchase","I liked the speakers but they don't come with the bases, out of eight years of online buying with Amazon, this is the first time I have been disapointed with my purchase, why would anyone buy speakers this tall and not want the bases to stand them on? so for that reason alone I will give this product 1 star, considering how many unsatisfied customers there are I feel Amazon should pull this product from the site, very disapointed."
5,Very interesting. I definitely rate it 5 stars.,"My Great uncle wrote this book.It is very interesting.It tells about his life and about how he felt.Sad,angry and happy etc."
2,"Overrated, Overrated, Overrated!","This is one of THE most OVERRATED movies I have EVER seen! (I haven't see it since it was in the theaters.) The only reason I give it two stars is for the two elements of it that I DID like, one star for the costumes; one for the cinematography. The REST of it? FORGET IT! It's SO BO-O-O-O-O-O-RING!"
5,Criterion page says 2.01:1 Not 2.35;1,"Most know Storraro is pushing 2.1 formatwhich is slighty wider than 16x9,Any 2.35:1 film which is released inin 2.01 which was shot in 2.35:1 will mean cropping the picture.And its clearly cropped and anyone who saw the film in the theatreand on fine Pal DVD version with be upset with the cropping of theof the sides of the picture,much like Apocalypse Now which Storaromessed with, so the picture is bigger.One wonders what Bertolluccithinks about his designs being redesigned,Criteron was too happy to have Storraro involved that they dropped theball,they sould off demanded a 2.35:1(or 2.20:1) version too.at least there is a couple fine Pal Versionswould get the fine Pal versions which are 2.35;1"
1,Not Director's Cut on Blu-Ray DVD,I agree with the last reviewer. There's gonna be much controversy with this Blu-Ray release because the last release on standard DVD was so spectacular. The Blu-Ray release seems to only contain the 165 min. version as opposed to the 219 min. Director's Cut. It would make sense for Criterion to release both versions with all the extras since they normally contain all the bells and whistles.
3,"China's last emperor, Manchukuo's ONLY emperor","A sweeping story filmed in wonderful style. Even if you aren't interested in Asian history this movie makes Henry Pu-Yi into a human being, not simply a footnote in some history book. Deposed by the Nationalists, manipulated by the Japanese and finally imprisoned by the Communists, Pu-Yi's tale is at times disturbing, poignent, even heart-rending.I loved the acting, the sets, the costumes, everything about this movie. Of course, it is a LONG movie and it does have a few spots that make it hard to watch. I feel, though, that it is one of the best ""historic epics"" to come out of the 1980s."
4,"Stunning film, terrible DVD quality","I bought this special version out of love for the original. In terms of the movie, I was never let down; this is truly a masterpiece. I was captivated with the new scenes. The only problem with this is the DVD quality. The movie itself has no problems, but the video and sound quality are severely under par for a DVD video. Other than that, it is an amazing movie, worth a buy."
1,The Last Emperor DVD- Don't buy it,"While the movie itself is great, the DVD transfer is the worst I have ever seen. It is full of shimmering and artifacts. Do not waste your money. Presumably, the VHS tape is acceptable."
3,Poor DVD Video Quality,"It is a five-star movie buy with a two-star DVD video quality---very, very poor. Do not but it if you want to enjoy good DVD quality."
1,technical quality destroys movie,"I was very much looking forward to see the director's cut of ""The Last Emperor"". Unfortunately the quality of the DVD is so bad that it's not worth watching. After 15 minutes I shut it off because I could not stand it anymore. Hopefully someone will make a decent transfer of this movie to DVD, otherwise keep your fingers off if you own a projector or a decent widescreen TV."
1,Horrible DVD picture quality,I was extremely disappointed by the transfer/picture quality of the DVD. It is by far the worst I've seen. If I could I'd return it for a refund. It's all the more a shame since I know the original film was beautiful.
4,The Last Emperor,"This movie, directed by Bernard Bertolucci, chronicles the life of the last emperor of China, Aisin-Gioro ""Henry"" Pu Yi, played by John Lone. It begins when he inherits the throne in 1908 at the age of three and continues to 1967 when the Maoists begin to rule. These 60 years witness a remarkable period of change: in 1912, China becomes a republic and the emperor merely a figurehead; in 1924, the Dynasty collapses and the emperor flees to Singapore and a roaring-twenties lifestyle; in WW II, there are more hardships as Japan ravishes the country and the emperor is a prisoner; then the Commies take over and the emperor is ""remolded"" into a citizen. The movie is fascinating and authentically filmed (including scenes done in the Forbidden City), but at 160 minutes (218 minutes in the Director's Cut version) it is way too long."
5,this movie blew my mind. it still does.,"absolutely wonderful movie. just the right ratio of accuracy/drama. emotional, painful, truthful. one of my favorites, and definately one of the 10 best of all time."
1,"Yeah, what he said.","I agree 100% with Nix Pix. He said it all. I only wish to reiterate here. Amazing film but world's worst DVD transfer. Shame on ARTISAN for releasing such an inferior product. DO NOT waste your time or money on this version. Even if you find it in a bargain bin for 99 cents, leave it alone. Unless you need a new coaster or something.Instead buy the new Criterion 4 disc remastered version. A little more expensive but well worth it. The preservation of excellent cinema alone justifies the expenditure. Better picture, better sound and finally the correct aspect ratio. Criterion is where it's at."
4,The Last Emperor,"Really enjoyed this film. Well done on every level. Looks, feel, story and acting as well as camera angles were just great."
1,The Last Emperor,"I am sure I would love the movie, IF I could actually watch it. Even though the DVD is labeled for ALL REGIONS, it will not play in my DVD player. It should not be labeled that way if it is not going to play in all DVD players in all countries.Very disappointed!"
5,very beautiful film,"It's a very interesting and beautiful film , especially the costumes, although for us Japanese it is but an orientalismus or chinoiserie of the westerners .And the characters of modern history are very distorted by the director willfuly. For example, the last emperor of China Puyi was a famous gay-man as every Japanese knows it very well. Nevertheless, in the film he is depicted as a heterosexual-man. It's very impolite for the deceased, since he himself didn't want to be portraited as a common heterosexual man.In addition, the idee of the film is prejudiced against Japan in accordance with Chinese propaganda !"
4,"Um, NOT one of the fifteen best movies I've ever seen","This film is well made, true. It's rather long, though. Perhaps needlessly so? The other woman, who said ""It was an ok portrayal of the Emperor"" was quite right. It was, and it was educational for me, since I had no prior knowledge of the Emperor. It was a nice film, and I liked it. On my four scale; a three and a half. You should be pleased by it if you have the patience, as any self-respecting movie buff does. I wouldn't overrate it as the viewer who said it was one of the fifteen greatest films he's ever seen though. Perhaps, for him, it is. But not for me personally."
4,no subtitling - otherwise marvelous,"I could have given this 5 stars if the DVD had some with English subtitling. Unfortunately, I missed much of the dialogue between whispering actors and actor accents and subtitles could have helped me."
3,"great film, awful dvd","I had the misfortune to buy this BEFORE I read the Amazon reviews and discovered that the DVD looked awful-a particular injustice for a film that won Best Picture. It's only 17 years old; there are films from the 30's that look great on DVD! I see though that in the U.K. they released a 2-disc version with commentary and both the original theatrical cut as well as the director's cut. I assume it's also restored and anamorphic and can only hope that we get an American version soon. The movie gets 5 stars, even at 219 minutes. The DVD gets 1 star, so that averages out to a generous 3."
3,"Excellent film, disappointing HD quality","The film is an excellent story and well acted. I was disappointed in the quality of the high def. It did not have the crispness or realism I have seen in other Blu-ray DVDs or even over cable. Recording is not poor, just not what I consider good high def."
2,The Fly In The Ointment,"The one bad apple in The Criterion Collection Blu-ray releases. There is hardly any difference between the blu-ray edition and the SD DVD edition. All the special features in the SD DVD you get in the blu-ray in a digipak (a really crappy one at that), however, you do not get the extended edition of the movie that came in the SD DVD. The one saving grace is that on amazon the Blu-ray is cheaper that SD DVD. I recommend that you pay a few dollars more for the SD edition which comes in a really nice digipak and a better booklet thats on the blu-ray.The news is that the transfer was approved by the cinematographer - what was he thinking?!?! Despite the crappy blu-ray transfer, the aspect-ratio is not what was in the original release.By the way, the movie is great and you will enjoy it"
2,Last Emperor Has No Clothes.,"Too Bad... What a shabby dressing technically given to this 1987 first class world ranking film.If it was shot in 70 mm this means the resolution, sharpness and color should be as smashingas it was in the theater. AND production standards at the time long before 1987 would have separatedthe different audio sources especially the rich Sakamoto score hence the ability to use surround soundbut IN REALITY the video is a bumpy ride; Grainy and color faded. No NOT with all that rich camera workpossible. The audio is the original TWO CHANNEL stereo. This was a sweeper at the Oscars and International venture. Why was it slapped directly to Blu Ray From shoddy transfer? ... give up? Gotta be money.TOTALLY Disappointing and a Shame.Ray Blue"
1,I hate the disc case. It's cheap cardboard crap,"I am only rating the cardboard disc case which for blu-ray is (in my opinion) sub standard. I have become a bit of a collector of blu-ray movies and love the nice blu-ray blue plastic case. This disc was sandwiched into a cardboard case which collapses so that it is hard to read the side label when placed onto my library shelf of discs. I find this greatly disappointing. Not going to affect world hunger or peace on earth, but I did not like it. The movie was quite good however. I am only rating it one star to express my anger over the cheapening of the collector case."
3,It was O.K. at protraying the emperor.,"This was an o.k. movie, but if any of my kids ever acted like that I'd smack them."
2,Not Interesting,"'The Last Emperor' is the story of a man who is not the least bit interesting. The emperor is living better than a God in his palace city while the Chinese people are living worse than his mouse. Trust me, the emperor's dog, if he had one, was probably living better than the Chinese people. The only thing I saw this man really ""doing"" during the entire film was play tennis. Other than that, he just sits or stands there expressionless letting events happen around him. No doubt, the filmmaking is impressive, but a movie cannot rely solely on that. Also, the movie portrays the Empress Dowager as some kind of enigmatic god-like creature. In reality, the Empress was an extremely cruel woman who does not deserve to be protrayed the way she was. There is an old Japanese proverb that says, ""If you believe everything you read, best not read"". Here are my words of wisdom to aspiring and great filmmakers: ""If you are going make a movie about an uninteresting man, best not make a movie."""
2,Not great,"Video quality wasn't the worst or best I have seen, movie is rather boring. Overall I would not recomend this at all."
2,WAAAAAY TOO LONG,"I watched the original version of this film and I can't really figure out why they would want to add another long dull hour to it. I didn't enjoy this movie much, mainly because I didn't feel any sympathy at all for the character. Maybe it's me, but when I can't relate on any kind of level to the people I'm watching on the screen, I don't have a very good time. The fact that it was an agonizing three hours long didn't help. I can see why this film won so many awards, though. It was very well done technically. The cinematography, sound, screenplay, etc., were all of high order, and the movie overall seemed to be well made. I just wish the people in it hadn't been so distant."
3,20th Century China History in a nutshell,"The movie is basically a straight-forward biopic of the last emperor of China as the name implies. What sets this Oscar winning film apart is the adept direction by Bernardo Bertolucci and his equally talented crew (especially the DP Vittorio Stararo). The colours that fill the screen is amazing. This movie has to been seen in the 70mm format in an IMAX auditorium.Production values aside, the only flaw in this film, is the deadpan performance of John Lone. He still represents the Western archetype of Asians in the Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu style of bad acting with equally bad accented English. The movie could have been better if it had been using the authentic Mandarin language (Pu Tong Hua).Overall, this edition is a disappointment. No extras whatsoever, save for a trailer for the DVD director's cut and some production notes. 5 stars for the film itself but 1 star for the DVD."
4,Sublime cinematography and costuming.,"I have to confess that there is probably no way that I personally could make it through this entire movie in one sitting. It's really long, and it's also heavy. It's worth seeing!!! Which makes me thrilled to have a pause button. :) This is a visually stunning movie. Gorgeous. And the costumes are divinely done. I do not know enough about Chinese history to make any assessment of the accuracy of this movie. However, as a Westerner with little knowledge of Chinese history, I felt that the movie helped open up another culture for me. [There are some scenes that are more difficult to watch than others; and I would recommend previewing before showing it to minors, as some will and some won't do well with the occassional--and realistic--graphicness.]"
2,did we really need an extra 55 minutes????????,"This movie was slow paced to begin with, but the extended version took three days to watch. I know there was a great story somewhere in the cryptic or confusing dialouge and long long LONG takes, but it is lost among the overblown proportion of this movie. Get the original cut if possible."
5,A big improvement in DVD treatment,"I already wrote a review for this movie, but I was reffering to the old region 1 issue.I decided to buy this region 2 version from amazon.co.uk and it was well worth it. The dvd contains interesting special features, including A behind the scenes and a documentary on Beijing during the mid 80's.Indeed this movie was rightfuly restaured.Aside from a few white speckles present in some of the scenes the image quality is nearly flawless.A huge improvement from the region 1 director's cut dvd where the image quality was most disagreable.This is an interesting, mermerizing epic story that finally got the treatment it deserves..."
2,Only good version of this great movie,"The quality of the taped version of the director's cut of this great movie is just as bad as the dvd version - washed out colors and all the faults mentioned in other reviews. The original taped version (non-director's cut) is watchable (rich colors, etc.). The only problem with that version is that it only comes in full screen."
1,"The worst DVD movie I ever seen, I mean technically.","I don't know how good the story is as I cannot concentrate on movie. This DVD's video and audio quality is TERRIBLE, I would give it 0 star for its quality. Fortunately I rent it, not buy it. The acadamy winner totally ruined by studio who released it."
3,Not in the ball park,"I am sorry, but The Last Emperor is very overrated. Primarily because you cannot get a strong feel of the historical context / perspective. The story telling, from a historical perspective, is very choppy and seems to be forced. I always compare movies like this to the standard bearer; Dr. Zhivago. Dr. Zhivago is in my opinion is one of the top ten, probably five, movies of all time...that I've seen. The Last Emperor is not in its ball park."
5,Super,Man was this great .For Historians it has everything .For Acting it has true emotion.For Production money was no object.Also the two disc version was really interesting.
5,What's not to like?,"It's a great story based on actual events. You'll get unreal visuals, a close up view of China's transition from kingdom to communist state, and a lesson in history. This film's lack of judgmental posturing is a tribute to storytelling. One example would be how the director handles the tumult during China's cultural revolution. Pu Yi's communist warden becomes a victim of the revolution and the one-time Emporer defends him! I never tire of watching this film. Every viewing reveals an undiscovered nuance."
1,"Excellent movie, *very* terrible DVD","While this is an excellent and engaging movie, DVD collectors should wait until another release to become available. The picture quality of this DVD is amazingly BAD, worse than VHS in some segments. Picture is dark in general, resolution low, colors bleed all over the place, and dialogs are difficult to understand. I am not sure how the disc was mastered, but the person who did it should be fired.It was a mistake to have purchased it sight unseen. 1 star for being a good movie and the commentary."
4,It helped me. It's a good book.,"Master Success asks you to examine almost every aspect of your life so that you may quickly begin to improve yourself. Covering everything from investing to prayer this book offers advice, quotes, and anecdotes to help you achieve your own goals.My only disappointment with this book is that it does not offer any real secrets to becoming successful overnight. Instead it claims there are no ""real"" secrets to success. It just presents practical principles and puts the burden on me to make simple changes to my life that will put me on the path to success.Master Success is fun and easy to read. It does not nag. It's nice to have principled advice presented in a positive manner."
5,my first ice cream maker,This was the first ice cream maker I ever had and wow was the ice cream better than anything I ever bought at the store. It lasted a couple of years but alas I'm having a hard time getting the lid to stay on so I have to go to something else.
3,Great product but incomplete manual and poor lid fit,"We just received the ice cream maker and it only came with a partial photocopied manual that does not contain any recipes (even though the first page says ""contains 40 bonus recipes""). Also, the lid did not fit and I had to shave off some of the plastic to get it to fit at all. Hopefully it performs well once we are able to try some recipes."
5,Awesome product,"Extremely pleased with product and seller. We purchased this one as a gift, and just ordered again yesterday for ourselves."
3,black market version?,"this one from Amazon appears to me coming from black-market! why? 1: it was in blank cardboard boxes with packing peanuts rather than nice tight fit official box with photo of it shown outside of box. 2: the manual was definitely zeroxed copy not binded but just stapled - as someone mentioned, there is no recipe included. 3: no warranty info. well. I only paid $22 so knock-off is ok as long as this works."
1,Where is the lid??,I have received 2 of these ice cream makers in the past 2 weeks now and BOTH are without the lid. I don't know what to do?? Should I continue to send them back and receive new ones until I get one with a lid?? Also.. the box is not the original. The instruction book is a photo copy and there are no recipes on it. I am wondering if they are refurbished??
4,"Media Enclosure - wrong dimensions, see my pic notes","The Amazon dimensions are different from the original product, they should correct this. Correct size is 14 3/8 by 14 inches"
2,not what is pictured and not corrected yet,"After I purchased the box, another customer posted pictures of what it really looked like. It did not have the more expensive hinged cover as portrayed in the picture posted by Amazon. I emailed Amazon and told them I did not have time return it but that I was very disappointed that it was not what was pictured. My local Home Depot had the box I received in stock and cheaper than the Amazon price. I was assured that they would deal with the picture to keep future customers from falling into the same trap as I did. However, that has been several weeks ago and they still have the same picture on the website??? It is a reasonable price for the product I got but it was not what I ordered."
3,Good DVD,"This DVD was good,but it suffers the same problem as ""Home on the Range Sing-along""-the kids showing off for the camera in the so-called ""Dance Along"".Once again,I suggest you skip the dance-along part if you don't want to see kids hamming it up and grinning stupidly at the camera while just stepping from side to side over and over again.The only really fun parts of this DVD were the Sing-Alongs themselves and the karaoke."
1,Aura Glow Cream,"Was disappointed that jar was only half full, I actually removed and weighed product, contained almost 2.5 oz, not 4 oz. Advertised as 'unscented', when using it has a heavy rose oil fragrance that hangs on, doesn't really rub it and for dry skin it just doesn't work well."
5,Musical Theatre Bible for Flop Lovers,"Ken Mandelbaum's book is a must-read for anyone who loves musical theatre. Mandelbaum names over 200 flops, and tells what went wrong. Witty opinions and strong facts are melded together to make this a MUST-READ. This is my ""Musical Theatre Bible..."""
5,Only If You Love Musical Comedy,"Fabulous research screaming for a sequel for the last 15 years. Buy this if you love musical comedy. Otherwise you might be bored by the details, but never by the author's wit."
5,"Top Flight Reference - Entertaining, Too","This is a must read for any Broadway fan! Mandelbaum dishes on which shows deserved to be flops, and which were victims of circumstances. Read it!"
5,Fascinating!!,"I've often speculated that the true sign of a musical theater aficionado is when one puts Les Miz and Phantom behind them and begins to find allure in the world of the flops. If that's the case, then certifiable musical theater queens need this book for reference. For anyone who believes the shows that didn't make it are more fascinating, this book is for you. A lot IS based on the author's opinions, but I nevertheless find myself reading this book over and over again. If you are someone who would rather learn about the genesis and failure of ""Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge"" rather than the success of ""Annie,"" then buy this book!!"
5,An absolute must-have for all musical theater fans!,"Not Since Carrie: 40 Years of Broadway Musical Flops' is a fascinating, highly entertaining retrospective of the Broadway musical flop. Ken Mandelbaum brilliantly conveys the strengths and weaknesses of each musical examined, giving insight as to the possible reasons for their early demise. If you love musical theatre and want to expand your knowledge and understanding of it, you will find this informative reading indispensable! It is a book you will turn to for reference time and again.R. Burcham"
3,Needs an update!,"Please Ken, update the book! There have been many more flops since this was published. ""Not Since Carrie"" is a great read - there aren't too many shows these days that open and close in the span of a week, or a few days. The financials simply don't allow for that anymore. So this is fascinating to read and get a glimpse of the theatrical past, which is often fleeting."
5,Absolutely essential reading for any theatre fan.,"Essential reading for show fans. A better history of American theatre than you'll get from any ""comprehensive"" dissertation. Mandelbaum's writing is sharp, funny, and concise -- and I suspect his research is absolutely correct. This is one book that I own two copies of -- one for rereading, one for lending. I now understand why ""Mack & Mabel"" never worked."
2,A Poor remake,"The 1970's version with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk was far, far superior. Michael Douglas was a poor choice for the Peter Falk role. The rewrite was also disappointing."
5,Funny movie,"A great comedy movie with a surprising comedic performance by my favorite actor, Michael Douglas. Will keep you laughing the entire movie."
2,Let's force Hollywood to come up with some new ideas,"Is Hollywood really that bereft of ideas that they need to tamper with and besmirch the memory of the most perfect comedy ever made?Do yourself a favor: save yourself and your moviegoing companion {money}by ignoring this film. Run - do not walk - down to your local video store and rent the original starring Alan Arkin and Peter Falk. Right now.Dianne Crittenden, who did the casting for the 1979 original, deserves a lifetime achievement award for pairing up Arkin and Falk. [Remember, Falk was one of the biggest stars on TV at the time as Detective Columbo. Who knew he'd be such a master at comic timing and deadpan delivery?]This isn't a swipe at Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas, but they had to know that by accepting these roles, they would be held to an unattainable standard.Let's force Hollywood to come up with some new ideas instead of destroying old ones within our lifetime."
1,UUUHHHHGHGGG!!!!!!,"My parents and I watched this movie, and were not expecting what we got. You see, it was supposed to be really funny, but it turned out boring, bland, and full of bad jokes. Do not waste youre money on this garbage, all it is, is a waste of time, and even the money it costs to rent it!"
1,not a comedy,"Being unfamiliar with the 1979 version, I thought this movie was a comedy. I was unaware it was more of a spy movie than anything else. I was disappointed. I was expecting more of a FATHER OF THE BRIDE type story line."
2,the in laws,"I received the movie in a short amount of time. The description stated that it was like new. I received it but the movie stopped in a couple of places and I had to wait for it to start again. I do not believe that this movie was ""like new"""
2,Stick to the Original...,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The original with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin was absolutely hilarious! This one was a bomb in its own right, but next to the original, it was a downright disaster. Do yourself a favor. Spend your hard-earned money on the original movie instead of this terrible remake. You'll love it."
5,Hilarious!,"I found this movie to be hilarious! It's about two men who are about to be in-laws. One is an undercover member of the CIA. The other is a stuffy, chicken podiatrist. The CIA member takes the podiatrist on one of his missions.This movie is like Meet the Parents with more action. Both of the stars are perfect for their roles. Michael Douglas is really funny. Albert Brooks is perfect for the role of the podiatrist. He has the perfect voice for histarical yelling, as proven in this movie and in Finding Nemo.An absolutely great movie! Two thumbs up!"
4,Light & funny,"This is a light movie that doesn't require much thinking. So if you are in a mood to watch something fun with your family this is good.It's about an under cover agent (Micheal Douglas) trying to catch the man who wants to buy a highly advanced undetectable submarine. While at the same time meeting his son's future in-laws & attending the wedding. He ends up involving his son's father in-law in the mission & there the comedy begins. Not much explanation goes into the spy/ submarine story, so it's a bit dissapoining there.All in all enjoyable but not memorable."
2,"Insipid, Vacuous, Empty, Irritating -","In this supposed comedy, a podiatrist man discovers that his new son-in-law's father (Michael Douglas) is weirder than he could imagine. Turns out Douglas is an undercover agent for the CIA and is trying to sell a Russian submarine to an arms smuggler in France. Lots of silly chases and stealing jets - all acted out as unrealistically as possible."
4,Michael Douglas movie a warranty for a good movie!,"Well, Michael Douglas is a warranty for a good movie, and my Dad is fan of him, so I buy this DVD for a present for him, so I hope he like it.I do not know jet.But in my opinion I like it very much, and it a fun movie, the make itown porpouse, intreteinment. and It did it for us"
1,Ugh,This was the most pitiful remake ever! The chemistry between characters was non-existant as was the humor of the original. The original was far better.
4,Better then average,This movie is better then average. It is meant to be a lightand funny movie and it meets those expectations.
3,Weird....,"Of course I am too young to even remember the original. or if I was old enough to remember, I did not see the original...but with that said, the movie was not that good to be honest. It was totally weird, and quite boring...not at all what I expected out of this ensemble cast!!! Skip this one!!"
4,Rolicking slapstick fun,"I totally disagree with the naysayers about this movie. It's fun, fast paced and funny overall. It's not Oscar material, but at least it's entertaining. A break from the slasher/techo computer generated/killer with attitude flicks. People lighten up...it's all in jest. Rent it for light hearted comedy with a good sound track and some surprises along the way!"
5,Keeps you on your toes,"Well, the kids are getting married. As usual the in-laws-to-be come from different environments. How different you may ask? Well you will just have to watch and find out. The father of the bride Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks) is a highly specialized doctor. His skills and training will come to play a crucial part in this story. The father of the groom Steve Tobias (Michael Douglas) is a fast paced, never home Xerox salesman. Jerry will soon find out how hectic the life of a Xerox salesman can be."
1,boring&Bland,i expected alot more with the folks in this film&I just was watching it waiting for something to happen but it never did.very forgettable.
2,Disappointing Remake!,"Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are wasted in this poor remake of the 1979 classic. In fact, this movie was not funny at all! The screenplay is just dreadful. Give it an extra star for trying, though as it did have a little suspense to it. Just not enough to save it from self destruction. They should have left it alone instead of trying to make money off of it, which is the only reason why I could think of this being remade. Disappointing!!"
2,Not too exciting,"There was one laugh-out-loud scene but other than that, I did not find this movie to exciting or interesting. This movie more reminds me of ""Meet the Parents"" instead of the original In-laws that this movie was based on. The only thing better than the original was how they gave more attention to the children being married than the two in-laws.The performance which I thought was good was Albert Brooks (I'm sorry, Douglas does not belong in comedy roles... when will Hollywood learn). He was fun to watch as a neurotic foot doctor learning how to live more fully thanks to the life style of Michael Douglas' character.In the end, I would not recommend this movie. I'm sure I could have been doing something more productive during the length of this movie... like housework."
3,totally ridiculous but still watchable,"ridiculous from the very beginning to the very end, but, well, still watchable. michael douglas still got some kind respectful energy to the viewers, 100 times better than what harrison ford shown in one of the most pathetic and worst movies, 'hollywood homicide'. if compare these two actors, ford is like a old guy trying very hard but fatally made a joke to himself, while douglas is like a never-become-too-old, always energetic and alive person, and he could always find fun in playing what he is supposed to play."
5,"Never saw the original, so I thought this was really cute!","I never saw the original version of ""The In-Laws"" (in fact, I didn't know there was one), so my review is not based on having such expectations as previous reviewers shared. I thought the movie was very amusing - good plot, funny, quality acting, and one particularly hot actor :o) - and worth seeing (maybe twice, second time at home). If you never saw the original ""In-Laws"", then don't base whether or not you see this on the other reviews. I don't know how this compares to the original, but looking at just this version, it's a really cute movie!"
1,WORST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!,this was one of the worst movies i had ever seen!! it was so stupid!!!!!!don't was te your time!
5,Suffering For Science,"Herzig connects scientists who suffer for their beliefs to religious persons who would suffer for theirs----an incredible connection that is rarely talked about. Herzig's interesting perspective on the history of science at the turn of the century, the way she pulled together the philosophy of suffering, science, and history, made me want to fill in the gap from the ""Barbarians"" of the 1920's--the book's last era--to current science....how much has really changed?"
5,Pure joy,"With startling erudition, Dr. Herzig reveals a range of interests from the hard sciences, the aesthetics, American history, modern philosophy, and classic literature...with a remarkable grip on each. Full citations nurture and provide able source material to the academic, yet SFS will challenge and enlighten the armchair reader as well. I loved it."
1,Not a good book to learn from.,"This text might be a good suppliment for a class tought by a higly motivated professor, but is awful for learning from. In other words, this book is a suppliment, or a reference, not a teacher. I've used almost all of Stewarts books on the Calculus, and I find the books to be great to reference or memorize formulas from, but that's as far as it goes. Don't buy it unless you must. Also, I've found several errors in the text."
4,Clear presentation,"I used this book for Calculus II, and I thought it was presented very nicely. It's easy to read and follow through the examples and then do the problems.However, this is not the best. I believe that Finney and Thomas's ninth edition of Calculus and Analytic Geometry is the best."
1,Dropped After One Year,We adopted this book because several of our neighboring colleges use the text. After using the book I am stunned that any college continues to use it. Our department never had so many complaints from students. We almost always suffer through a text for the full 4-year adoption period. This text was so bad that we dropped it after one year.
3,So-So,"I really wanted to like this textbook after reading through all the reviews on here, I hoped that all those who disliked it simply did not want to learn calculus.Overall the book is not horrible but it does not stand on its own. Only on limits I am already forced to go through the library to find better textbooks to explain concepts. Working through on my own also I was only able to make little progress in it. The biggest flaw I have noticed is that there simply are not enough problems; the application problems are interesting but they do not help in learning how to master a subject. Often a very difficult type of problem will only have three or four problems with answers on it. One learns calculus (and for that matter any mathematics) by doing as many problems as possible."
2,Have a second book on hand for examples.,"The Stewart Calculus book is ok, but not great. It does not have nearly enough examples and is calculus dumbed down for the new math student. I found I had to look at the Thomas and Finney Calculus book, the old standard for calculus. The only redeemable feature of the book is that the derivatives and integrals sections are totally divided up between chapter 3 and 5; and there are practical applications of each in chapters 4 and 6 (respectively)."
1,Not Helpful,I was required to buy this book. It was a waste of my money. I had to go out and buy another book that I could understand.
1,Horrible,"Badly written, expensive, boring problems, poor motivation of material. Avoid. There are many better books out there. R.Shankar's Basic Training in Mathematics is great, Spivak's Calculus for the analysis stuff and if you're american then Kline's Calculus is an excellent choice."
2,Jello has more substance.,"The first thing you notice about this book is that it is over 1300 pages long with nicely formatted text, pretty diagrams, lots of exercises and a little math trivia.Dig a little deeper and you will find yourself staring at pretty pages for days, trying to figure out the missing, or parts of, proofs that were assumed. There are very few proofs in this book and the ones present are in shorthand with chunks missing.This may be acceptable for the ""thank-you-laude"" engineering crowd but to those interested in understanding what's going on under-the-hood, it's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together.After a year of flipping through the pages of this error-laced tome, I have finally put this glorified recipe book to rest. As of next semester, I will be using a real calculus book: Spivak.The two stars are for effort; not substance."
3,Too complicated.........,"This book is not that suitable for guy like me who is still a beginner in the calculas. There is not enough example in the book. Besides, the worst is that most of the exercises given at the back of each chapter don't have the example as reference."
1,Confusing Presentation,"Up until I took calculus from this book I thought I was pretty good in math. On several occasions I read the author's presentations over and over. Either he has no idea how to explain things OR I have simply lost my math ability. I hope it is the latter because I need to take two other math courses. Hopefully, they will not be courses that use books by this author."
2,Advanced High School Calculus,"Having completed a two semester college introductory course in differential and integral Calculus based on M. Spivak's book, a browse through Stewart's Calculus left me with a somewhat sour taste of mouth. Practically no demonstrations of theorems; little reference to basic analysis, which some people consider THE most important difference between a great Calculus course and a run of the mill one. If anything, this is a good book on learning how to use the tools provided by Calculus, but without an adequate focus on the subject itself.I could have grudgingly given three stars, had it not been for the absurdly high price. Definitely not worth it."
1,Disjointed,"I cannot recommend this text for use with students who need help with calculus. Perhaps students who already know calculus might find the book interesting, but that is only a guess. I can attest to the fact that the typical student in my class found the text disjointed, frustrating, and verbose."
3,this a sophisticated approach to calculus,"i used this book in class and found this book to be, what some people call a harvard level textbook, the explanations require much investigation on the part of the student, if someone is really into math then this is a good book because you will spend many hours pondering over what the heck he is trying to say, i.e. chap. 3"
2,Mixed feelings,"I took two consecutive 1st year 1-semester calculus courses and I used this book for both. I have mixed feelings about it, because I have been lucky to be taught by good professors who gave good lectures, so I used my class notes. However, I inevitably missed a few lectures, and had to study from the book. A terrifying experience. Was it my fault, being not used to the author's style ? Anyway, I think that one example per case is not enough, and stuying the series chapter was difficult. The author definitely and absolutely fails to emphasise what is important, he writes just as much about some obscure application than about the main points of the principle. There are simply not enough examples for the important concepts. Also, there is some theory, confusing most students, without being enough for a mathematics major. I just started using Calculus: One and Several Variables by Salas/ Hille/ Etgen. I wish I had it in 1st year. Anyway, even 2 stars is generous for Stewart's."
3,could be better but does the job.,"the chapter on vector calculus was confusing and the examples were ridiculous in that they didn't fully teach the concepts. if you want a real calculus book, try Anton. half of our class used Anton's Calculus to learn the material since the chapters are in the same order pretty much."
1,A VERY DRY TEXTBOOK - AND I KNOW THE OTHERS TOO!,"Don't waste your time with this book folks. Not only is it the dryest textbook I've had the displeasure of using, it gives the learning student a lack of example problems that would facilitate learning. This is clearly one of the worst calculus books ever to be published. Don't waste your money on this textbook. The greatest textbook I could recommend to you, dear reader, is Howard Anton's Calculus with Analytic Geometry. It is a University textbook that is far superior to Stewart's. It is eveything that Stewart's book isn't. I have used both of these books in a University environment. Good luck!"
1,The Worst Math Book I Ever Had,I can't believe that this book has any positive reviews at Amazon.com. Who wrote them? The author's mother? This author knows nothing about how students learn calculus.
1,Weak In Calculus Theory,"I don't expect a beginning level calculus text to have all the rigor necessary to develop calculus with precision. I do expect, however, that the author of such a text be honest and tell students that the mathematical precision necessary for the course is only appropriate at higher level courses. What bothers me greatly about this text is that it purports to be rigorous, complete, and precise. I am writing this review to tell you that it is not! It has many problems in theory, especially in the third semester. Here is one example of the sloppiness in the text. The text claims that a ""parametric curve"" is a set of points in the coordinate plane. This is not correct. This is the definition of a ""graph."" A parametric curve is supposed to be defined as a set of points in the coordinate plane TOGETHER with a set of parametric equations that generate the points."
1,NOT Recommended,"This book is not recommended for students who need clear simple writing. I really bugs me that teachers are the ones who choose textbooks. They often seem to choose a high-toned book like this. It is clearly written for teachers, NOT for students."
3,How's your Algebra and Trig?,"Your aptitude in these subjects must be qualified when considering to study this book. If you lack a deftness or rich saturation in these areas you will NOT fair well. As for the text, not enough attention is paid to the development of the mathematical ideas expressed and no communication of these ideas is given by any other relavent aproach, I site the common ""application oreinted"" Calulus text.This is a great hinderace for anyone partaking in the bitter-sweet cup of self study. Although if one has proper tutilage the book becomes now, terse and clear, reminisent of a referance manual, presenting only the most fundamental facts in an aesthetically pleasing way.If you are one that does not have access to directive hand. Consider rather the Horizon Calculus 6th Ed. Anton., wich graciously presents a deeper and more concise review of pertient Algebra and Trigonomety concepts as well as a wider breadth of treatment on the mathematical theories in Calculus."
4,A great text for students who want to learn.,While studying Mathematics at the University of Idaho I used this textbook for three semesters. When I took Calculus I appreciated this book for its great illustrations and it's numerous problems to work out at the end of each section. Now I am a calculus tutor and I see the real brilliance of this book is in its layout and progression. The manor in which it builds on itself allows the student to take manageable steps and see where what they are doing is coming from. If a student is wiling to invest in their learning this book is a great opportunity!
1,Can't Understand The Explanations,"I tried reading this book, but I simply cannot understand the author's explanations. I wonder if he ever had any experiences with real students in a real classroom?"
1,Difficult Book,"I took calculus from this book. I am an engineering student. The book did not help me in my engineering classes. To get help, I had to go to the library and check out other calculus books that had more practical, engineering examples. I would not recommend this book to a student who wants to know how calculus is used in engineering."
2,Please avoid this book!!!,"This book tends to complicate the subjects compare to other calculus book. For Calculus I or II, it might be bearable. But the mulivariable part of this book is the WORST ever. It makes the theorem extremely difficult to understand. Frequently, the problems given are extremely hard and long (3 - 4 pages of work), such as verifying the Stokes' theorem. And it DOESN'T have the solution in the back. (odd nor even problems) If you want to challenge yourself on those problems, go on. But if you are a regular student who just need to get an A or B in the course, stay away from it."
2,"Not for the ""average joe""","I bought this book mainly for a reference. Looking through it, it seems to be like most all upper level math books -not very user friendly!Why do these over-educated math nerds who write these books make them sooo hard to follow!?!? Although I can solve the problems in this book, I cant figure out why it is written on such a level to where the average person would have difficulty in learning calculus!I do not recommend this book except for reference only!"
1,There are better books,Too conceptual..the book does not rely on enough examples. Problem sets not like the examples worked out at all.
4,Not perfect but no calculus book is!,"I'll start of by saying what is bad about the book. When introducing a topic, they use a lot of numbers instead of words. Not everyone can follow numbers but graphs and examples that further illustrate the topic would be very helpful. Also, on occassion the book skips a step or two when explaining a point. However unless you have absolutely no calculus experience it shouldn't be too harmful. There are nice illustrations in this book that are helpful. Also there are many examples to help you. Another nice feature is that you can get an additional study guide and answer book to accompany this one. Another nice feature is that it doesn't introduce strange topics too soon."
5,Every recipe a gem,"This is my favorite cookbook, even though I also own Mollie Katzen's excellent Moosewood and EBF cookbooks. I'm a vegetarian, so I do lament that only 41 of Dojny's 75 recipes are vegetarian. But every recipe I've used is a gem. Its advantages over Moosewood include: 1) Katzen is woefully short on bean recipes. As a vegetarian, I can eat far more nutritiously and cheaply with beans at the center of my diet. 2) Dojny's recipe's are reliably tasty. Katzen does have some mediocre ones. 3) Mmm, mmm, I can't believe how good it all tastes!"
4,A nice addition to the library,"I liked this book. The Bear is a God among all SEC fans and this book does him great justice as a field general and dominator of the SEC. Check out ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" if you're an SEC Freak like I am."
5,It will take you to another world,"I have been a fan of Ms. Denby's since 1989 and I have to say that if it's chakra balancing you need, you will get it when you listen to this wonderful album. How nice that there is finally an actual sound wave attunement program you can use to balance creative visualization. The sound waves make it possible for an individual to totally become one within to make the chakras move. Haunting and beautiful as well as beneficial for spritual health. Well worth the investment!"
3,paid too much,"I was a little irritated that I paid 5 bucks for the book and when I received it, the suggested price was 2.95. I thought Amazon would be cheaper, not more. Learned my lesson."
4,Concise and understandable.,"Vodou, while shrouded in mysticism and magic for many U.S. citizens is a rich and storied traditional practice and way of life in Haiti, with its variations of Santeria in Cuba and manifestations in Brazil and other Latin America.Leslie Desmangles' stance on Vodou and Roman Catholicism being in a symbiotic relationship is interesting, and he defines the relationship adequately, though I would disagree with that assessment. However, his descriptions and depictions of Vodou to the Haitian practitioner are impressive and are much easier to read than Maya Deren's prose (though it is beautiful and rich as well)."
4,"An exhausting, overwhelming read that is also fascinating and disturbing. But only for those with cast-iron stomachs...","When the character Flan wakes up one morning to a world on fire, he grabs his burning toupee, his fish Ginger Kang Kang, and sets forth to be reunited with his girlfriend. On their Candide-like journey, they witness mutilated, burnt, pus-and-fly-egg-filled bodies, freakish anthropomorphic creatures and cannibalism. As participants, Ginger gobbles the brains of enemies, Flan cuts throats and strangles others who get in his way, while (at one point), Jesus wonders about performing miracles with dismembered limbs.An exhausting, overwhelming read, 'Flan' is also fascinating and disturbing fiction. It is as though reality had been replaced by a vision that Bosch and Dali would have been proud of. A reader's warning: I think it is fair to say this is really only for those readers with cast-iron stomachs and an inherent interest in the bizarre and freakish."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I was looking for a basic introduction to Mardi Gras to share with elementary French classes. This book is big on the past, but has little to do with present day Mardi Gras celebrations. The cover is wonderful, and it was images such as this that I was hoping for more of. If it is JUST history you are interested in, this will be a fine choice."
1,Shocking poor quality,"They say you can't judge a book by its cover; well that was never truer than here. The cover art looks enticing, and the actual book is full of great historical photographs--which would be wonderful if they were of even passable image quality. They're not. Each and every one looks like a low-res, amateur scan from an old newspaper--for all I know, that's what they are. Black and white, of course, not a single one is color--what a crime, documenting this most colorful of celebrations. Blurry, low-contrast, horrible resolution, and most are tiny to boot. This wouldn't even have been acceptable back in 1977, when the book was originally published. For this day and age, it's inexcusable--a waste of time and money. Save your pennies."
2,Not recommended,"Obviously, there is a need for a colorful, up to date, expository text on the Mardi Gras tradition. This is not it."
1,Sherlock Holmes,"This order for CDs taught me to never order CDs on-line in the future. Audio level from song to song (on the same CD) varies widely. Some songs are at nearly ""full volume"" and other songs can barely be heard at all. In the future I'll buy my CDs at a business where I can take them back if I encounter such a problem"
1,One of the most boring and overrated books ever written.,"I have never read such a boring piece of garbage. Any school that is assigning this to students should be charged with torture.In all honesty, the only one who possibly has a clue what is supposed to be going on in the story is the author. I bought this book for a nickle at a garage sale; I want my money back!"
5,Beamo - perfect flying disk for all ages,The Beamo is the best flying disk I've ever seen for the entire family. Small children can throw it and catch it without fear of hurting themselves. The hole in the middle makes it especially easy to catch. We've had one for over 8 years. It's faded from being in the weather but still works perfectly. It's hard to find and seems to be priced about the same no matter where you get it. It's well worth the $25.
1,Seller is a ripoff,"Ordered this for elementary coach. Picture shows three discs, and the price is 2.5 times the price of other sellers. Huge disappointment when only one arrived. I usually only leave reviews for how great service was, but I just had to let everyone know this item is a ripoff. Please purchase else where. Rating only reflects the seller. The product is what it is. Incredibly huge, cute colors."
1,HOW MANY are being sold here at this price???,"Saw this product on Amazon.com at approx $19. Wondering if anyone can tell me if the price they're showing it at here is for THREE, not only ONE. I'd certainly get them all for an employee's children then. I do hope it is for all three at this price.{can not Rate this item since I do not have it yet. Until I know the answer to my question I am able to proceed purchasing it, receiving it and in the meantime I shall give it's lack of information only ONE star, for all of the demanded rating questions: How much fun is this toy? 1 starHow would you rate this toy's educational value? No stars selected 1 starHow durable is this toy? 1 starHow do you rate this toy overall? 1 star]"
1,Not worth it!,"There is entirely too much content that was reused from the previous cathouse series release. There is nothing ""Special"" about Cathouse ""The Specials."""
1,BOORING,This game shows what potential DVD has a game platform butunfortunately it is ruined by poor software engineering.It is fun for the first five minutes then it is BOORING.
3,"Uraguay Sandal, Copper",Just a darling sandal! The strap across the foot is too wide making the sandal slip on your foot. It would be great for people with a wide foot.
5,"Yup, it's a lightbulb...",Has been on for about 10 hours nightly for the past few weeks in an outdoor landscaping light and works great. The convenience of shopping on Amazon can't be beat for random items like this.
