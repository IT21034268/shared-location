4,good hardware but software took some effort,"The primary software called MyKey was completely missing so the device would not work; however, it was an easy download from IBM. The privacy software, KeySafe, was actually on the device but it was an old version, and it required another easy download from IBM to upgrade it. KeySafe enables you to designate a section of the memory for password access only--a very nice feature if you want that. Nothing in the manual or the pdf guide helped me figure out that I needed to do these downloads to get it up and running. The device itself is nicely designed with green see-through plastic and a processing light. Comes with a nifty leather carry case and cord."
2,Dissapointing relative to previous Hagood Hardy instramental,"This work does not compare with the melodic and beautiful instramentals Hagood Hardy produced on the ""Homecoming"" album. The vocals ruin the wonderful renditions of these traditional favorites. The vocals make this work seem ordinary while it could have been extrordinary. The only reward on this CD was the ageless favorite ""The Homecoming"". This was the only reason I gave it a ""2-star"" rating instead of a 1."
5,The Knights Are The Real Deal,"Maybe it's me, but when it comes to California pop anthems, Gary Usher is like Brian Wilson - he can do no wrong. I won't go long on description. Just listen to the sound bites posted here - you know when it's the real deal. If you dig The Hondells and The Super Stocks - you're gonna dig The Knights. You can bet your Surfer Magazine subscription - it's the good ol' ""Wrecking Crew"" pounding out these odes to sun, sand, and rail jobs."
4,Great player,"It basically plays everything! It has a decent design as well. Looks good in the dash-board. It is slightly taller then the standard one, therefore it does not fit perfectly. That's the only disadvantage I could come up with. Other than that, I really like it. I would certainly recommend it!"
1,"Falls out, too quiet!","This headset came with my S105. It's horrible in noisy environments! I can hardly use it in the car because people can't hear me and I can't hear them unless we try really hard. On top of that, it's always falling out unless I get the clip ""just right"" (which takes a long time!) and then sometimes it still falls out. It's more of a hazard to driving than a help!"
1,Samsung needs to make a different headset,These in-the-ear headsets [are bad]. I cannot get any of them to stay in my ear unless I do not move my head so they are worthless for driving. I have a nice Jabra Earwrap headset I use with my work cell that fits and works nice. Why does Samsung have to come up with this proprietary design plug that nothing else will work with? They should atleast supply an adapter so you can use a headset with a standard 2.5mm plug. I tried making one myself by using the plug from this original earbud and it does not work well. Lots of interference. If anyone comes up with a solution for this please let me know. If I had known I would be stuck with this ... earbud I would not have bought this V205 phone!
1,Don't buy this product unless you have time to return it,"This product is terrible. I have owned 5 of them in the past 2 months and none of them have worked longer than a month. If the speaker works, the microphone doesn't. If the microphone works, the speaker doesn't. If I had known how difficult it would be to find a decent hands-free, I would not have bought the V205."
1,This ear piece always malfunctions,"I have been using my samsung v205 earpiece since i got the phone 7 months ago, i am on my 3 one, the ear piece messes up the same way, after awhile of everyday use the top of the mic/answer button cord seems to come a loose, or something and then you can hear the person your calling or they cant hear you. I dont recommend this earpiece for anyone. And the thing about the v205 is its almost impossible to find a replacement cause all of them i tried didnt work with my phone."
1,very uncomfortable ear piece,The ear bud is too big and is painful to wear even for more than 15 minutes. I tried other headsets only to find out from Samsung that the jack on my S105 is proprietary and repeatedly disconnects all non-Samsung headsets.
1,Don't buy it,"When I first see this product, I really like it, but the fact is not what I think, it looks good, but did't works good. When I first time use it, it works out pretty well in first minute. REMEMBER, Just one minute. After I use it for 15 minutes, people cannot hear anything at all, I need to pull it out and then plug it in again, yet after few minutes, it didn't work again, I just went crazy!Well, maybe I just bad luck enough to get a broken one, so i just give it one star, in fact i want to give it a negetive star!!!"
4,Fascinating...,"If you are thinking of beginning Qi Gong, this book is a must on the history of this ancient Chinese practice. Some of the recipes in the back are way too intense for me, but the bulk of the writing is very intriguing. My lessons begin in 2 weeks. I feel as though I'm ready to truly begin to experience the Healing Art...."
3,song titles shown are not by Burdon,"The samples heard are by Eric Burdon, the titles shown are from a Dion (Di Mucci) album ""Return Of The Wanderer""Return Of The Wanderer(which is a great album, by the way.) Check out his new album, ""Tank Full Of Blues""Tank Full of BluesThe Burdon soundbites do sound pretty good, though."
3,Not the best bluegrass,"The instrumentation on this album is generally good and Clark and Buck Trent are two of the best but the harmonies are disappointing. It just isn't the ""high and tight"" that is typical of better bluegrass. If you want to add another side of Roy Clark to your collection this is fine but if you're looking for quality bluegrass take a pass."
5,I love the series.,I don't know which character I like most. As a whole the series is always entertaining. Stereo is my personal favorite.
5,soothing sound,I Found This CD By Accident While Listening To Samples.I Didn't Really Know What I Was Looking For But As Soon As I Played This I Knew This Was It! This Is Much More Than Music. Sound Vibration That Reaches The Inner Self. I Now Have 7 Goldman CD's And They All Are Great!
2,Make friends with a Jeweler!,I have had the silver version of this watch for 6 months and have had it repaired twice so far. The mechanism jams and the watch will not work. It is relatively easy for a watch repairer to unjam but the problem still exists and will cost more than the value of the watch to completely fix it.I have also heard that the main spring is likely to break if you overwind it.
2,Decent...,"I agree with some of the other reviews on here, if you like JKX, you may or may not like this DVD. It does seem like he struggles at different times throughout the show. It's extremely raunchy - like jokes about 5-year-olds masturbating?!? It's stupid at times. It does have a really high production value though.Some of the extras on the DVD are ""jokes that weren't funny enough"" which is a set of jokes they edited out of the main show because they were worse than the already ""average"" jokes that made it into the show. Then there's another ""bonus feature"" where he re-uses a joke that his opener uses, thus totally embarrassing himself. So the ""extra features"" are actually very dissappointing.Overall this is incredibly average and Jamie is just simply better at the Jamie Kennedy Experiment. I recommend any of the three seasons if you truely want to see Jamie at his finest."
2,Passable,"This was ok. Funny enough to make the girls laugh...but then, well...anyway. He can be funny, but with his twit demeanor and petty jealousy it's hard to fully embrace him."
1,Inept and Obnoxious,"A flashy, well-shot stand up comedy special featuring an overstuffed set (which provides the biggest laugh). Kennedy uncomfortably meanders from topic to topic, only at ease when playing the wacky characters that are supposedly the backbone of his comedic ability. He has no point of view, no personality, and, it seems, no jokes (look it up on IMDB; four writers are credited). In a market where original voices struggle for years to get this kind of exposure, its sickening that a vapid pseudo-celebrity like Jamie Kennedy can manage to convince the masses that this is stand up comedy."
1,Worst Stand-Up I've Ever Seen,I have no problems at all with material that some might find offensive if it's funny. We need to be able to laugh at ourselves and the world around us. But someone needs to tell Jamie Kennedy that offensive is not automatically funny. There was nothing funny about this act; it was crude for the sake of being crude with no laughs. I'll never watch this comedian again.
4,Very funny,"I enjoyed this a lot. There were a number of laugh our loud moments and he has a distinctive style. I don't know if any of it was super-original, but I would definitely seek out more."
3,it's ok,"I needed something fast for my longer rolls of wrapping paper. These containers seem somewhat hard to find, so I didn't investigate enough before purchasing. The lid doesn't snap tight and the container itself seems a bit top heavy so it tips easily. The rolls fit great though!"
3,Expensive way to store wrapping paper.,"I purchased this product (approx. 2 months ago) mostly because I was tired of storing my 40"" rolls of wrapping paper under our bed. I cannot see why this plastic box cost $99. Being desperate, I bought it anyway. It does the job, but I wish I would have not made such an impulse purchase and did a bit more investigating on similar storage boxes. Heck...maybe even some sort of trash can would have worked for 40"" rolls of paper? I would have given this product 5 stars if it had cost $19.99 instead of $99.99! I see that 'Sterilite' now has a similar product available for $29.99. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Rubbermaid Jumbo Wrap N'Craft 45 inch storage container,"Dear Customer Service,I still have not received this product. When can I expect to receive it?Lea DeAndrea"
3,The Simple Life -- Not so simple to write about,"I am and continue to be intrigued by the notion of simplicity. However, I find most writing on this subject to be unsatisfying. This book was no different. There is little doubt that Ms Lippe possesses a fair bit of insight on this subject. Her emphasis and insight on living in the moment strikes me as important and a powerful tool for living a simple life. This component of the work makes the book worth reading. Nonetheless, it seems to be that the path to simplicity is richly variable and person specific. Books such as these are moderately useful, mostly from the stand point of reminding us to look deeper within ourselves."
2,Nothing much,"I will keep this short. I found most of this book derivative, condescending and lacking cohesion. The author's various stories come to no clear point. She just goes here and there lamely winding it all together by saying things like 'stay in the present' and 'don't get attached to material things' - all of which has been said. Oddly she is a publisher and claims to only publish books that she thinks will change the spiritual landscape. Her own book falls quite short of this. One's money could be better spent on books such as ""Voluntary Simplicity"" by Duane Elgin or the quite large ""The Simple Living Guide"" by Janet Luhrs."
3,Consider your purpose....,"If you cannot embrace the basic tenets of Eastern philosophy, then you should not bother reading this book. If you're steeped in the concept of a self-directed purposeful life that reflects the tenets of Western culture, this book will probably have no resonance or utility for you and will make you very edgy to complete the slim tome and just get on with things. - LRM"
3,More Than I Wanted to Know,"I looked forward to reading this book, based on reviews I'd read elsewhere; however, the actual read was a disappointment. Although the book started out with a great premise, it quickly turned into a self-absorbed meditation on this particular woman's life habits. I found the tone to be annoyingly smug and unnecessarily detailed. (Who cares if she catches a dish when she drops it, or if it smashes on the floor?) I applaud the desire to live a simple life and experience it to the fullest, but I felt that the author wanted me to believe that her way was the only way. By the time I finished, I was glad it was a short book and there were no more pages left over. I was exhausted."
4,"Sandy really ""gets"" CHILDREN'S wisdom!",So few books (still!) show women in Scripture and display them well; Sandy's story-telling genius gives females of all ages a new insight into their value before God!
3,Awesome until 3 1/2 months old...,"I received this tub at a baby shower. Its very cute and the sling works really well for newborn babies up to about 10 pounds. My son loved it until he was about 3 months old. When he grew too big for the sling, I removed it and placed him in the hard tub (there is hardly any padding). He didn't like it at all. The tub has this raised part in the middle that is supposed to hold him up...it does hold him up but it raises his legs in the air and I can't wash his butt. Its kind of small, so when baby is too big for the sling, he kicks around and hurts his feet on the sides. If they had made the tub a little bigger or let the sling accomodate more weight it would have been better."
4,Great for smaller babies,"This tub worked great for my son who was 3 pounds when he was born. The insert made bath time so much easier than with the regular baby tubs. As my son got older I just unhooked the sling and continued to use the pillow for cushion. The tub is quite small and if you have a long baby you will need to buy a larger tub in the future. I would recommed this to anyone with a premie or small baby, you will get more use out of it."
4,great bake set,"I have the larger version of this set which was purchased at BJ's. I love how evenly it bakes, plus nothing has stuck to any of the pans. The only thing that I must do is adjust the baking temperature of any cake or cookie recipe down 25 degrees or else it burns. I think this is due to the fact that these are dark colored pans and absorb more heat. Other than that they are wonderful pans."
1,Goey Gunk,I had the exact same problem with this bakeware. I couldn't get the sticker off. I should have taken them back but I got it off with fingernail polish remover.
1,gooey stuff,"hello,i am glad i am not the only one out there suffering from the gooey mess that is on our brand new pans! i hope someone comes up with a solution and shares the knowledge. i rated this as a 1 star... if there is a way to get rid of the glue then i might change my star status... i hope oneida calls me back and helps me with a solution...if/when they do call me back i will pass on my info!"
1,The worst play I've ever read!,"I typically love the works of Tennessee Williams, but I absolutely hated this play. It was written at the end of William's life and career as a playwright and it's a shame he had to leave the world on what was such a low note, in my opinion. I kid you not when I tell you that this play is about absolutley nothing! Ok--so a woman named Claire brings her ""brother"", Kip, with her to the beach and they meet up with August, a gay playwright--just like Williams--who is struggling to have one of his plays produced on Broadway. These three characters engage in meaningless dialogue for the remainder of the play while they're haunted by ghosts of the main character's past. It's the worst play I've ever read--but I reccomend you read it. It's one of those things that's so bad it's good, which is what kept me from giving it a 1."
3,where's the bushings,"Come on now for all that money you could not have sent item with spacers,is everything ala cart with you guys, I know the chinese would have sent them..."
5,Highly engaging,"Ms. Prose (what a name) wrote one of the best and funniest modern satires--""Blue Angle""--so I was eager to see what she would come up with next. ""A Changed Man"" is similarly insightful, and she controls the characters so deftly--and understands them so well--that even the most unlikely romance (it would seem laughable if I described the novel's plot) becomes not only plausible but quite compelling."
3,"Good Stuff, but not Great","There's a lot of good stuff in this book. You already know the plot by now if you've read the other reviews -- skinhead decides to change his life and walks into the foundation offices of a Holocaust survivor. It's an interesting premise, and Prose does, I think, a good job with some of her characters. I really bought Bonnie as a single mom, particularly her relationship with her kids. I also found Meyer to be a great character, very conflicted about his own motivations.What I didn't find so compelling: the ending was pretty contrived, in a way that tried to be too meta- about being contrived. I also was not really clear about Vincent's motivations until pretty far into the book.On the other hand, let's face it, I've read a lot of ""summer reading"" crap this year and it's miles better than that stuff. So it's worth a look."
2,"A botched attempt at a ""good"" thing","When I first read the premise for this novel, I hardly thought it was creative, (I have seen American History X), but decided to give it a chance anyway. Prose's writing is so unbelievable that I could hardly finish the first few chapters. She has no knowledge of what a thirty-something male ex-skinhead might be thinking, and it shows. Her use of slang is awkward and difficult to read, as are the passages of Vincent ""looks too much like McVeigh"" Nolan checking out Bonnie's ""ass."" This novel is forced and it screams it. Read something else."
1,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE!!,"I thought that this book was actually going to give me options on ow to manage my high risk pregnancy and what to do or avoid in order to stay pregnant, but it did NOT!! It's more of a dictionary. It explains some things and what the meaning of medical terms are but it doesn't give you any advice whatsoever. It doesn't tell you anythhing that your doctor can't tell you. I wouldn't recomment it at all."
3,"If you're buying this, you HAVE to - but there are better choices","This book contains a lot of good information, but is very redundant - the charts and graphs retell what is written in the text, and it ""talks down"" to the reader.If you're buying this book, you probably HAVE TO for a class or something; if you're looking for a book for reference reading, skip it and find a better choice."
4,"Nice grooves,","This album really focuses on Billy Martin's street beats and the sonic character of Medeski's organ. While the instrumentation is stripped down compared to MMW, the grooves are tight and creative and nicely accented with effects. The album has a nice old school vibe to it, like the warm glow of a vacuum tube, and a lot of diversity among styles. My faves on the album are Crustaceatron, Bonfa and Miss Teardrop"
4,Judy will be Judy,"The new kid on the block of T.B.N. (Trinity Broadcasting Network). This lady is so anointed, I was at a Benny Hinn Crusade where she sang. All I can say is....the Glory came down upon us. This is a CD that you would want in your own personal player. This CD speaks to latest thing that is happening in the body of Christ. This lady is Bible-Believing, Holy Ghost filled, and fire baptized...and get this, SHE PREACHES. VISIT HER WEBSITE (www.judyjacobs.com) you may also want to purchase a CD by Karen Wheaton called ""Freedom""! (www.karenwheaton.com)"
5,No GOD like jehovah,"I watch T B N every night,some times all night. I enjoy praising the LORD with every one. I get touched by Karen Wheaton and Judy jackobs also many of the ministers such as Benny Hinn, Mark Chorona, T D jakes , paula white , Juanita Bynum, Kandy Station.Jessie Duplantis, Joel Osten.and many more. I learn from all of them and love to praise with them. i would love to visit some of you some day,but I don't get much money and I caint work because of me physical problems. I live on a small fixed incom. S S disability. so pray for me and My children and grand children. espically the oldest grand son. He nees God in a mighty way. My thanks to Jan and paul and most of all GOD for T B N. GODS""love to GODS""people. Love, Dorothy Bell"
5,Great remake of a classic!,Wonderful easy-to-read version of the classic Tom Thumb. The illustrations add so much to the story and help the children step into the make believe life of tiny Tom.
2,Missing some instructions!,Had to do a bunch of research to figure out the proper installation on my 2004 Pontiac Vibe. I have a factory amp and the harness doesn't have a pin for it. I had to physically cut the wire on the factory harness and attach it to the amp wire on the deck harness.
1,Terrible,"This item is not as good as the ones you see at your local Walmart or Target. I was hoping for higher quality. And the service of restockit was terrible. The items arrived late, dirty, and not of quality construction."
5,Readable and Contemporary Translation,"I have two Medea from two translators.Philip Vellacott and Nicholas Rudall.I compared them and I like Dr. Rudall's translation because it is easy to readfor someone who is a high school student or ESL student.Moreover, the language that Dr. Rudall uses is modern and it ""gives individual characters specific speech patters (as Euripides surely did). Medea is quick, deeply ironic, occasionally morbidly funny, and capable of passions ranging from seething anger to weeping regret. Jason is a politician. He speaks well and lies--perhaps believing that he speaks the truth.""Moreover, I'd like to have a thin and pocket book to carry so I chose to keep this copy."
1,Froze my computer. Immediate support costs $199.00 per incident.,"When I put the card in my computer, I couldn't get into the configuration to add the card. I tried contacting Adaptec Support, but have to pay $199.00 (yes that's right), to be able to talk to a representative. They will only support using email for free which is a joke since they broke by computer!Don't support companies that will not support you when you buy their product."
3,Rin Tin Tin Doble Feature # 3,"Although it is a collection film, in Vengeance of Rannah the dog presentation is very short an the plot is not one of the best."
3,Mouth didn't move,My grand daughter loved it but when it sang the mouth didn't move. She didn't care but wanted it anyway.
5,One of the Classics,"Next to the Plastic Ono Band album, this is Lennon's best. It is a true classic in every sense of the word. His song writing alone is probably his best ever as a solo artist. How Do You Sleep? is my favorite cut. He lashes out at McCartney during what was the height of their feud. It is aided in spirit by George Harrison's appearance on the cut. Of course the title cut is one of the best songs Lennon ever wrote. Jealous Guy is also a great piece. This album will stand out forever in rock history. It is one of the top 5 best Beatle solo albums."
4,John's greatest album,"This is John's greatest album after leaving the Beatles. ""Imagine,"" is a masterpiece.The song was Yoko's idea,but wasn't given songwriting credit on the record.""How do you sleep?"" about Paul McCartney,is so funny.Paul wrote a song on his next album making fun at the way John sings.There's alot of songs on this record I don't care for,but ""Imagine"" makes this album priceless ."
5,what digital sound is for,"You know the songs or you wouldn't be reading this. Is it worth the additional investment? Well, I've just compared the original cd version with this remastered disc, and I have to say the new one is, indeed, superior. In fact, it may be the best digital remastering I've ever heard. I love the majestic sweep of the strings on ""Imagine"" and ""How"" and the new-found bottom and sting on ""Gimme Some Truth."" And ""Oh Yoko"" remains the sweetest ""silly love song"" ever committed to magnetic tape. The booklet has some wonderful new (and old) photos, too.So, is this another media conglomerate trying to pump up sales of its back catalog by getting people to spend money on music they already own? Of course. Should you buy it anyway? Most certainly."
4,"A Little Disappointing, But Still Great","After hearing and witnessing the power of ""Plastic Ono Band"", I bought ""Imagine"". I thought it would have the same style, given I've heard four tracks off of the album prior to its purchase. However, I can't give John as much credit for this one as I did for ""Plastic Ono Band"". I do like this album, with great tracks such as ""Imagine"", ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Jealous Guy"", and ""How Do You Sleep"", but I HATE the songs ""I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier Mama I Don't Wanna Die"" because it is too long for what it has to offer, and some of the lyrics are just stupid. Also, ""Oh Yoko"" is awful! The song is so awful and mediocre that I cannot like it at all... just not possible. But, the album in its entirety is absolutely wonderful work with a few exceptions. This one and ""Plastic Ono Band"" are the only two special John Lennon albums. (""Double Fantasy"" would have made three given you-know-who didn't sing half the songs on it.)"
3,I love Lennon but...,"John's solo stuff is uneven and this is a classic example of it. Though this album is generally considered to be his greatest work, it's not as good as ""Plastic Ono Band,"" though it is much more commercial. But the sad fact remains that there are only three good songs on here, ""Imagine,"" ""Oh Yoko"" and the lovely ""Jealous Guy."" The rest are filler songs.""How do You Sleep"" is famous only for its satirical and biting lyrics directed againt McCartney, but it's not a good song, it's grating and drones on. Even George's acerbic guitar work on this cut doesn't save it.I revere John Lennon but am not blinded to his faults. This album was highly overrated when it was released and it hasn't held up well in the intervening thirty years."
4,Beautiful despite the lyrics,"""Imagine"" is a beautiful song. It's appeal, however, lies not in its lyrics, but in its simple melody and its understated arrangement. The lyrics consist of platitudes, not poetry. They sound like a Miss America contestant's response to a question from Bert Parks."
3,Cutting off his nose to spite his face,"This album could have been so great, but it is completely marred by John's (and Yoko's)spiteful little ditty How do you sleep? The album's message, after all,is: Imagine the world will be as one; excuse me while I kneecap my best friend. Lennon said later he was reacting to McCartney's Ram, but one has to look closely to see anything--while McCartney's response to Lennon (Dear Friend in the otherwise terrible Wild Life album) is one of the greatest songs of turning the other cheek ever written. I can forgive Lennon (after all McCartney did), but I'm sick of Lennon's fans going on about how ""delicious"" and ""honest"" this song is. Face it, Lennon needed an editor. Ringo walked out rather than join in; Yoko egged Lennon on. By the way, Yoko uses every possible occasion to include it--it is obviously her favorite Lennon/Ono song."
5,"John Lennon - the man, the genius","John Lennon, in my opinion, truly had the greatest solo career as an ex-Beatle. Paul was always very poppy, Harrison was great but truly not as great as Lennon, Ringo... well he's just Ringo. John Lennon's lovely songs such as ""Jealous Guy"", ""Imagine"", and ""Oh Yoko!"" are truly great works of art. John had a great sense of music and it shows in this album. His story of life as a man reveals himself to be a genius."
5,Cranky Reviewer?,"How, pray tell, could John Lennon have stolen a piano riff from Oasis, a poser band whose members were in diapers when Imagine was written and released? Page through the Cranky Reviewer's complete reviews...you will not be disappointed."
3,John Lennon,This cd is great. We do a lot of driving across the desert and do no subscribe to satellite radio. We listen to a lot of cds.
4,Wow,"Still hard to believe this Album came out in 1971. It's one of the best ever. I would vote it easily one of the best of the century. Only reason it is 4 stars is because of Yoko. I don't care for her and wish he had recorded without her, but regardless it is still one of the best. Also, it has a lot more soul than most people realize or ever knew. It's so hard is one of the best songs most people have never heard."
1,The loony Lennon,"Yes fame and a creepy wife doesn't do you good as it tends to rattle your brain, this album goes a long way in proving that Lennon was a walking talking contradiction, the man was nuts and went off to spread a vile message of `peace only through humanity"" over the globe, only to be proven wrong by Mark David Chapmanup datebefore the up date This was a mean review, but at the time it was writen out of anger towards Lennon's wife, she had made a remark I found ignorant and so on, so I'll leave it at this more venom-less review"
4,But where's the surround mix?,"This is a great album - no question, and I have no complaints about the remastering. But what bugs me is that the original vinyl from the early 1970s was available in quadrophonic (the early version of 5.1), so given this already exists, was released while John was alive (and therefore, you would assume, happy with it), why not put this version out?You know we'd all buy it again..."
5,Great Love Songs,Imagine. A fascinating album due to the differences is themes. Love songs and cynical songs on 1 album.I think Imagine ranks amongst John's best albums due to the fact that it contains two of his finest Love songs. Jealous Guy and How.
4,"Heard ""Oh My Love"" Again for the First Time Today","I've always been a huge Beatles fan for the creative instincts and great execution they had. I loved and bought all of the John Lennon solo albums when they came out and loved the social commentary, passion and musical compositions. It had been a good 10 to 20 years since--my LPs aren't accessible right now. So when I heard ""Oh My Love"" on the sound track of the movie with Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Hewitt-Love and Gene Hackman it was with totally new ears. I haven't been able to stop hearing the melody in my head and thinking about the song and JL's post-Beatles writing ever since.Some of the other songs are ""just OK"" on the album, and there's a lot of other good stuff here, too, but this particular song hit me as being particularly moving and good after not hearing it for a long time.Overall--A JOY and a blast back to the past!!!--Pedro"
3,Dont believe the hype,"Because it contains the man's most beloved song, its easy to say that the album that followd it is his best, but that is simply not the case.Plastic Ono Band is the best album from Lennon's haphazard solo career.Imagine the album is POB with mushy commercial orchestrations, music for the masses ( Lennon even acknowledged this, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to have a hit record). I mean its a nice listen, but compared to the raw, bone crunching power of POB its a little limp to say the least. Imagine's hardest number, How Do You Sleep, the infamous childish slam on Paul McCartney is tame by comparison.So stop reading this review and type in Plastic Ono Band into the search box, and don't fall for the hype."
2,Possibly the most over-rated album ever,"Possibly the most over rated album of the rock era, this is bad politics married to catchy tunes by a shallow thinking pop-star. If you need proof, listen to the title song: ""Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try... not thinking to live or die for... above us only sky..."" Perfect description of Pol Pot's reign of terror. Then the cute attack on Paul McCartney, and the pop ditty about Yoko... Lennon's musical value is muddied by all the adulation. He isn't horrible as a pop song writer, actually pretty good; but his gift gets lost in the legend and this album attained legendary status much too quickly to be of any real value; which is part of the problem with all rock music criticism."
2,Sad,"A few days ago I listened to this album for the first time in many years. My thought is how sad it must have been to be so angry to have written lyrics like those in Gimme Some Truth, and How Do You Sleep. Especially since How Do You Sleep was such a direct criticism of Paul McCartney, who was responsible for much of the success of the Beatles."
4,Not for robotics,"This is a good book on algorithms in machine vision, not computer vision. It is important that you know the difference before you buy this book. Machine vision is used in manufacturing plants for detecting the parts according to your needs. On the other hand, computer vision is integrated into AI where you can create vision input for your robotics or AI system.That's why this book is good for those who wants to create Photoshop-like effects or implement systems for part analysis. If you are looking for something related with robotics, look for elsewhere."
1,Worst Norelco I have used,"I hoped this razor would condition like my other Norelco's, and I like Norelco shavers, but his one has never shaved well in over 2 years of use. It is only OK for a quick shave but it leaves a lot of stubble and I do not have a heavy beard. I have cleaned and lubricated it regularly and changed the heads but no improvement. For a better shave I have returned to my older models even my old corded one with old heads does better, and an older cordless I travel with. I recommend avoiding this model and get the new 3D 1280, or a Braun with the cleaner for a close shave if you get a newer model."
1,Disappointed,"The seller is top notch, but the Norelco shaver is sub-standard. I should have made sure it was on a par with the Quadra shavers they made several years ago, but it is similar to those now offered by Phillips Norelco. The new models are no where near as good as those made in the past. The speeds have been slowed to the point that a clean shave is unattainable. You can go over and over the same place time and again and still never obtain a good shave. The factory rep told me the new shavers were intentionally engineered to run slower to make them quieter. I don't know why a company would intentionally ruin a superior product. The new shavers offered by them are a waste of money. Give me a noisier shaver any day if it will run faster and perform like the old ones!"
1,Bad rechargeble battery system,"Like many models I used in Norelco with electronic indicator, this one is equipped with die-down rechargeble battery (now it's only up to the 2nd row of the hight on a full charge). My old 5605X still has good battery to recharge as it does not have fancy electronic lighting charge indicator. Shall we say Norelco is not capable of developing a vital power battery on a customer affordable price?"
3,OK but....,Ordered this mouthpiece for my 13 year old clarinet player. He liked it at first but then came home saying it wasn't that good and wanted a 5RV.
2,I Just Don't Get It...,"I'd heard that Bob Dorough was ""pixyish"" and ""winsome"" and ""charming,"" but when I listen to this CD it all boils down to diabetes-inducingly ""cute."" Dorough has a singing voice that, to me, is the equivalent of nails on a blackboard, although the playing is fine (which accounts for two stars instead of one). The problem is that Mr. Dorough spends most of the time singing. The closest I can describe his voice is that of a male Carol Channing, and his original songs are also, well, cute.You may very well adore this CD, as Mr. Dorough does have a following, but do yourself a favor and listen to the samples above first. What you hear is what you get."
2,Putting aside my belief that different types of ...,"Putting aside my belief that different types of toothpaste are just marketing gimmicks, I just didn't care for this one. It was too foamy and its taste was bland. Applying the two ingredients in equal amounts was also hard to do -- the consistency was too runny and I usually ended up using too much. If I needed a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, I'd try something else."
3,Good Overall Comp,"This is a pretty good idea of what Gary was up to from '84 to '92 with his own record label 'NUMA'. For the price this is a good buy as it contains Gary's experimentation with funk, saxaphones, and female backing vocals. A far cry from the ""Wall of sound"" material. As great as albums like 79's 'REPLICAS' and 'The Pleasure Principle'. These tracks show a progression and maturity in Numan's songwriting creating a looser sound with slap bass, flowing percussion, saxaphones and driving synths.If you think Gary Numan can be summed up with 'Cars' this should be a plesant surprise and a very interesting listen."
5,PANASONIC KX-TG5576M CORDLESS PHONE AND ANSWERING SYSTEM,"WE ENJOY THE PHONE FOR ITS HANDSET WITH THE COLORED LIGHTS THAT DISPLAY WHEN IT RINGS, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT COLOR FOR FAMILY, FRIENDS, BUSINESS AND UNKNOWNS. THE CALL TALKING IS A GREAT FEATURE AS IS THE COLORS ON THE SCREENS, HANDSET AND ANSWERING SYSTEM ""METALLIC GREY"". PHONES BEEN GREAT TO US. JOHN ROCHE"
5,For Lovers of Detail & Folks without Computer programs,"They say Volume I is going out of print, so if you can grab it, please do! This series, which even has further volumes, if you can find them, are the best ever with which to learn the basics. Easy to understand and yet covers all the bases."
4,The Horse Boy and I,"I don't know what I can say to make you watch this film, but please do. It's one of those beautiful stories that stays with you for days (weeks even, but that may just be just me)."
5,Great story...,"Educational, informative and heart warming documentary. Also sad and poignant. Highly recommend.'Also loved the book."
4,"Wow, I am suprisingly pleased!!","I was definitely not expecting the quality that I received based on the price and size, but this is one of the best deals BY FAR! I was a little disappointed by the lack of buttons and features like having to dock with the actual iPod cable through the bottom. Also, the aux plug is just a headphone jack that you plug into the top of the iPod and not the bottom, but the Sound definitely makes up for it."
4,works great,"quick review, i purchased this item specifically for vacation, and to fill a hotel room the speakers are just fine, now if you are relying on this product to replace some nicer stereo equipment then you will be dissapointed, but overall solid execution. One negative is the nano doesnt exactly fit snug into the holder, other than that all else ok."
3,Ipod Nano - 2nd gen owners beware,"While the quality of the speakers are very good, generation 2 Ipod Nano owners need to know that the there is not an adaptor available to hold your ipod correctly in place. When I talked to Logitech, they simply sent me the same adaptors that originally came with the speakers. Also, in order to charge the unit while using the speakers, you will need to either connect to your computer USB port, or buy an optional Apple Ipod charging adaptor for your Ipod."
2,A little disappointed,"Unit is small and comes with a great carrying case and all the adapters you could require, however, the volume is poor. My laptop actually plays louder than this unit."
2,Item viewed is not the same shipped,"I love Amazon.com, but they shipped me the ATI Radeon 9800PRO AGP 256 MAC edition twice now, which makes me doubt whether they actually do have the item.I love ordering through Amazon, but these two same wrong items shipped to me within 2 weeks make me hesitate. Never though this would happen to me by Amazon :-("
5,"works great, dont forget that it is a crossfire card",one of ATI's fastest and most flexible graphics processors :) was wonderful when it came out and still works great for most games.
5,"Delicious, cute and sustainable!","These mini-rings are great for cupcakes or mini-pineapple upside-down cakes, etc. My kids love them! Plus they're organic and sustainably farmed. No added sugar or syrup, either - just pineapple juice. Amazon's price is better than the local grocery and since they're canned, they keep for a long time!"
3,good but not as good as the original Farsi,I was very excited when I ordered this book but found it not as good as the original work in Farsi. I admit it's difficult to capture the same essence in a translation but it's a good attempt nevertheless.
5,A wonderful toy . . .,"Aurora Super Mush is the highest quality plush you can buy for the price. He is very large with probably the softest fur out there (it feels alot like rabbit fur to me). Mush has highly detailed eyes and nice airbrushing on his coat. He is just the right size to snuggle with at night (if you like big plushies). Also, his big huge paws are darling! If you are an adult collector of plush (like me) or have a child who enjoys plush animals, Mush is a must-have."
4,Nothing But The Best: Radio Classics,"""Nothing But the Best: Radio Classics "" I love this Albumn. I highly recommend it to fans of White Heart Christian rock."
2,Doesn't hold charge very long.,I still keep going back to the original Canon battery that came with the camera. I use this as a spare between charges but it never lasts more than a dozen pics or so.
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. Prelude / Main Theme 2. In The Channel / Capturing The Boat 3. The Audience / The Monkey / The Pearl 4. In The Rose Garden / Love Theme 5. Panama / The Ambush / The Jungle 6.

2,Rubix Bomb,"First of all I love the rubix cube, I love its puzzle and yes I can solve it. My problem with the keychain is it broke, its not durable. It just popped when I was playing with the pieces and they flew everywhere and I was in a public space, I thought it may have been my fault so I gathered the pieces. Then on a different occasion it exploded everywhere and thats where I left it lol. Its a nice fun product but play with it too much and it wont last."
1,"Brutal, terrible","I recently learned to solve the Rubik's cube and wanted a practice model that I could take with me on the go. I didn't expect a fine, speed cube, but I expected more than this.It's incredibly difficult to rotate. I'm not sure any amount of oil will help. And it's not machined properly so the pieces don't fit well. You have to have it perfectly aligned to get any rotation on it, otherwise you WILL break it. Also, you WILL break it, anyway.Due to the effort involved in doing any series of moves, you're likely to make a mistake, and the difficulty of using this thing is absolutely punishing in how hard it is to reset."
3,"Cute, but difficult to maneuver and fragile","This cube is cute, but much harder to turn than a full-size cube. I'm not really sure why this is since it seems that they could have just down-sized the original mechanism. I popped the cube apart and lubed the inside and this helped a little, but not enough. It also feels as if it would be easy to break the cube apart while working it, although this has not happened to me because when I feel tension I back off and make sure the sides are lined up. The keychain is useful, but if they had made it a little lighter-weight it wouldn't have gotten in the way so much. Overall it's a fun gift for someone who likes Rubik's Cubes, but don't get it as an introduction to the cubes because it might turn you off the real thing before you give it a chance."
2,falls apart,"The cube on this keychain fell apart the minute my son tried to move it. After it was put back together, it fell apart again right away. It's now sitting on his dresser in pieces. Worthless. Very disappointing."
1,Ripped Off,I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas to replace one she had and lost. Upon opening the box I received the back cardboard the item should have been attached to but not the toy itself and got NO answers when I tried to get them to actually send me the toy. Be careful when ordering this as you may not actually get the product but a iece of cardboard with a picture of the item only.
1,it turned to pieces,"It turned to pieces in 1 minutes after I opened the box, I tried to fix it, but I didn't want to break my finger, don't buy."
2,A real one is better.,"Even if you can solve a Rubik's cube I wouldn't buy this. The pieces fall apart and gets stuck when you twist. If you twist too hard it breaks. If you tug on the chain it breaks. Don't buy it, it's not worth it. The shipping and handling was more than the actual thing."
2,Just an ornamental,"It's just an ornamental. It is hard to move. I thought it was made by rubik's, but the lubrication and adjustability are very bad. What is more, one of the center cube became loose after several moves. However, it is very beautiful and small. It is not for fast solving, but just long trip tease."
2,Barely makes it,"I remember my father had a rubik keychain 30 years ago that was 10 times better than this one.This version is not durable, the center pieces come off with a little push. Gets stuck very easily. It works, but it's not nearly as good as the old version."
2,Full of problems,"This book seems to be a good beginning tool for those not familiar at all with InDesign or who want to brush up on their skills. I purchased this book for a college course in desktop publishing and was very skeptical. I am majoring in communication design, so for the last four years I've been using InDesign. The book wasn't of much help for someone like myself who's been using the software for sometime. Therefore I don't recommend the book for anyone who's familiar with InDesign.The CD that accompanies the book is a great learning tool (meaning it's good if you've never used InDesign). However it is filled with errors. I've encountered several errors in the exercises that make it very difficult for beginners. I'm sure there's a better book on the market that will teach InDesign in a more effective, error free way.So, to conclude... look for a different book. This one is full of way too many irritating errors."
5,A very Practical book,"The print is clear and easy to read, even when several people are reading over the shoulders of someone sitting at the piano. There are also Guitar chords and grips that makes the book Doubly worth while. This is not a Cheat book. It also gives the copyright information any entertainer needs to know."
3,terrible proof reading,"What a pity that this delightful little story is so badly printed. It is full of odd typographical errors that make me suspect that the process was indeed ""untouched by human hands"" or minds. We are glad to have been able to find this, but some human being should look over the text before it is sent out into the world."
3,An Okay Read,"Jelly Belly is a good book about balance. It's a little bit old...try ,like, 15 years, but is okay. Ned dealing with his weight problem makes readers sympathize with him. He wants to get thin, but he eats and snacks way too much. Then he gets sent to a ""fat farm"" and meets some new friends. The rest of the book has a very ""diary"" feel to it, with Ned talking about his weight ""changes"" (I'm just going to leave it at that...)The book has a very dated feel to it, thanks to the rather HORRIBLE, cartoony, exagerated, and mis-informed illustrations and the laughable character relationships. For instance, at the ""family day"" at camp, Ned says ""sucks"". His dad corrects him...that's pretty 1986. All in all, an okay fat story."
2,Beware of profanity,"I am reading this book to my children ages 6, 9, 10.I was disappointed to run across profanity used by ""Richard"" in and shocked that ""Ned"" told his dad that ""Camp Lean Too [stunk]"".Needless to say, I've had to modify the story for my children.We loved the other books by Robert Kimmel Smith such as Chocolate Fever and At War with Grandpa.Jelly Belly is a disappointment!"
1,Not that great,"This book was all together disappointing. It was very repeative and offered very little useful information. It had one or two good points, but repeated them over and over. If you want to hunt elk in Montana, this book goes over every possible place an elk could be, whick is a lot of places. Parts of the book were controdictory to other parts. No mention of field judging antlers, and very little mention of useful equipment. If you are looking for a good elk hunting book check out elk hunting by mike eastman."
5,It grows on you,The more I listen to this CD the more I like it. It is somewhat mellow and the 'new age' label shouldn't stop anyone from getting this album. The must is just beautiful to listen to. Forget the label put on the music and just immerse yourself in the sound.
5,Different Levin album.,"It's pleasant from Mr.Levin that he recorded such a kind of instrumental music, I'm pleased that it shows Tony's ability to be a different. ""Waters Of Eden"" more personal, sonorous, passionate and quiet, Mr. Levin's playing needs no dithyrambs, he is a man who deserved attention even of my eight years old daughter , with his deep melodic bass lines and cello playing. All compositions are beautiful to listen, a mellow album. Tony at it best."
2,"Great technical performance, crappy musical performance","Tony Levin is amazing musician that has had a long career of doing brilliant work.Unfortunately, this CD sounds more like a technical demo-- i.e. clarity of sound, mix, etc..-- than an attempt at making music to actually inspire any kind of emotional reaction from the listener.Sounds great, flawless performance and-- perhaps-- one of the most boring and uninspiring recordings I have ever heard.If you need a CD to test the quality of a sound system, this is a candidate. If you are looking for something to inspire, move, or otherwise garner any kind of non-technical reaction, don't bother...."
2,Disappointing effort from a great bassist,"Having been a fan of Tony Levin for many years, I was excited to see this solo effort. Unfortunately I wasn't excited to hear it. The songwriting is quite boring and Levin's technique is not enough to rescue the attempt. I love this guy when someone else (Peter Gabriel, Robert Fripp, etc.) is providing the musical inspiration. I went back to it several times hoping to feel differently, to no avail. If you want an inspired performance by Tony, pick up the Secret Garden live perfomance by Peter Gabriel on CD, LD, or VHS."
2,EZ Listening Disc,"Yipes! Representing those who REALLY LIKED ""World Diary"" and who have followed Tony's career with care over many years, this record is something of a shock. There's a tremendous amount of name talent mustered for the effort, but the results are, for the most part, surprisingly conventional and cloying. There are a couple of tracks that stand on their own, but as a whole, this collection has all the edges filed off. I'm sure there is a substantial potential market for this material: it should appeal to anyone that collects Windham Hill. But for those that have other expectations, consider yourself warned!"
2,Save your money on this one,"When I first noticed this CD as a new release from Tony Levin,Premier Bass player,I had to have it! After listening to it several times though,I'm still very dissapointed. One would expect much more from a musician whose best playing to date is with other musicians. I hope Tony spends the money I used to purchase this cd wisely.""Real"" musical efforts should be supported by the fans but not this lame attempt.I'm burning this bridge and moving on to better artists!"
5,Loved it!,Loved the smell and made my skin SUPER soft after using it.This is the only kind of shaving gel I ever buy now.
2,Fair to Partially Cloudy,"This is definitly the most complete book about the O2K Web Components, but all that shows is how little information is available. There was very little explanation of how to do things. The book was mostly focused on telling you what the components can do and a few examples rather than how to do it. Most of the functionality in which I was really interested was quickly breezed over because there was ""much more functionality than this chapter can cover"". At less than 400 pages, I think they could've made the chapters large enough to cover a little more of the functionality. After going through the book, I have a better understanding of what the Office 2000 Web Components do, but I've still had to figure out mostly on my own how to do it all. In the end, I feel like I paid for a press release or spec sheet rather than an instruction manual."
1,Not much more than what was in the help doc/MSDN,"This is probably the best book on OWC avaliable. This is mostly due to the fact that it's probably the *only* book on OWC available.There's not substantially more information in the book than what is in the online help file. (And the book is nowhere near comprehensive as a reference) Much of the examples are extremely basic and do not delve into the actual issues that will be encountered developing anything other than a trivial OWC implementation.If you're on an extremely tight schedule, need some basic OWC examples, and don't have time to read the documentation or search for examples on the web/MSDN, then this book may be helpful. Otherwise, save your moneyMicrosoft Press has some extremely good items in its catalog(Petzold, Richter, etc). However, this book is mostly just a thinly disguised marketing datasheet. Hopefully, O'Reilly will publish an OWC book."
2,Seek and you shall find,Nothing new here. All the information presented is available on the web..especially in the MSOWC.CHM help file that you can find in the Office directory. Definitely no shedding of new light on subjects like Pivot Table drill downs. The object model is not covered well and documentation is scarce.
1,drive is miss represented,amazon fails to tell dell laptop owners that this unit will not run without power supply cost $18 + shipping $12 total $30. now if that woun't make ya mad there ain't a fish in the sea.
2,IOGear USB Hard Drive,Problem with this drive. It does not work with a standard USB cable included. Must have a Y cable that was sent to me after several calls to IOGear's tech support. It took a return and 30 days to get this product to work. After that it is working fine! Good luck!John...
5,Great Book - really inspiring,We love this book and have gotten several copies in order to share with friends. Amazing detailed explanation about life and death
1,"How do you say ""confusing"" in Polish?","Polish is tough enough without books that make it more complicated. We're using this book in our Polish class at Columbia University, and the general concensus is it's not a good book. It seems poorly planned, awkwardly assembled and does a bad job of helping folks understand a truly complex language. The ""helpful"" tables often make little sense. Before you feel like you've grasped something, the book is heading down another path. Exercises often have vague or confusing instructions. There's way too much head scratching."
5,Unity,I got say that this is one of the greatest Reggae Albums of all time!! It is differnt from the norm and it raises the bar of reggae music to a different level. This is a must buy album!
5,An original piece of art,This album is the original stuff with a delicate and tantalizing flavour of contemporary instruments. It has all the strapping of a masterpiece.You are doing yourself a disservice if you haven't listened to this beautiful piece of art!
4,Castle,"Book Review!on the book CastleThis was a good book, it had a lot ofinformation on how they make a castle. it also told how they protect their castle bythrowing stones at the people below andshooting them with bows through little slotsin the walls. The pictures in the book were good, they helped me understand the information a lot better. I would tell other people toread it unless you don't like castles orsomething like that. But other wise its a really good book to read. I would give this book a 8-10 And that's pretty good for me!"
5,So that's how a castle works!,"If your students study Castles as part of their unit on the middle ages, they will see detailed drawings of the parts of a castle that make it a defensive weapon and reason the analogy of the castle to the dragon, complete with portcullis and arrowshoot. A superb study of the plumbing system and view of the castle in situ."
4,good book,i relly aprecieated the book but it was in poor conditiion but what can u xpect for cheep :) thanks
4,For kids and their parents,"I bought this book twenty years ago while in college because it was so well illustrated, and it did such a great job of answering questions I had about how castles were built and arranged. I haven't looked at it since, but save dit because I knew someday my kids would love it as much as I did.This week my 2nd grade son checked out a perfectly good book on castles from his school. He poured over the illustrations and read the captions, but he couldn't get answers to his questions: ""Dad, what's a 'keep'?.... How did they get up so high to build the towers? ....""We pulled out Macaulay and he was enthralled. The art work, the text, and the whole flow of the book are all just so well done.Glad I kept this!"
5,Wonderful!,"This book is great! It taught me a lot about castles. It has great pictures, and a superb storyline. It will always remain one of my favorite books!"
2,Did the Ratz sell out??,"I listen to the Tunnel Rats because not only they are talented but they bring a good message and I find their lyrics inspiring. That being said I cant understand why they would create an album with fowl language while professing Christ in the same sentence. It takes more effort to use articulate words rather than a bitter tongue, so I hope they continue with the positive message with the talent that they were given."
2,Lexmark truly proves that you get what you pay for,"The Lexmark e321 is fast and cheap, but those are the only good things about this diabolically mediocre piece of engineering. It's unsuitable for high-volume printing because it lacks a large paper capacity, so you're constantly feeding this thing paper. Worse, if you don't put the paper in exactly right it grabs three or four sheets at a time and jams up fairly regularly. The text is poor to passable but figures are murky. Personally I don't think the few bucks you might save are worth all the hassle and inconvenience that come with such a sub-par product. Undying, everlasting hatred does not sum up the extent to which I loathe the Lexmark E321."
4,Quite an interesting read.,"I was using this book as an artifact for a paper I was writing about women revolutionaries, and Vera Figner fit that role perfectly. The voice in which she writes is enthralling. A good read for anyone interested in women in politics, Russian history, and radical revolutionaries."
1,dreadful quality....avoid unless you are a collector...,"Once again I've bit on something I knew I should avoid...so maybe I can save some of my online friends a few bucks! This is a Rockpalast show from 1984 and it might even be worth owning...but the video is not only second generation at best but this company Immortal continues in its tradition of taking old full screen shows, stretching them to widescreen format (everyone gets a bit fatter in the process) to make them seem more current?Unless you just have to have every bit of INXS on DVD you can get...wait for a legit release, this has to be some sort of boot... I'd sell mine but the prices are dropping fast!"
1,The ogham alphabet almost listed.,"Don't buy this book. This pamphlet-length book has a brief introduction and then presents the alphabet, 2 pages per letter. The left of the two facing pages has the ""English"" representation of the letter with a block print of the Ogham letter as it would appear carved in wood. The right facing page has a block print of the Ogham letter as it would appear carved on rock. The problem is that the book doesn't get the alphabet rigtht: the last three letters have conflicting representations on the facing pages. So if you want to know what the Ogham alphabet is (as I still do), then buy a different book on Ogham."
1,BEWARE - This software can no longer be activated,"Adobe have turned off the activation server for this software so if you buy it, you can't use it. You can however download a free version from Adobe which does not require activation - they're giving it away."
4,Another of Luther's string of quality productions,"Luther continues to produce albums/cd's that are at times good listening ,and at other times Gold/ Platimum quality. If you've ever seen him perform, you know that he is an outstanding talent, a gracious host, and very meticulous in putting together the very best show that he can. All of that is reflected in every track that he records."
4,One of the best; personal statement,"Luther continues to flourish the world with his blessed voice and beautiful arrangements. This album is one of his most personal ones to date. As usual Luther is on top of the world when doing ballads, but ""Are You Using Me?"" proves to be his best dance track and one of the best dance tracks of the year. I have always felt the hurt and disappointments in Luther's voice. That's what makes his voice so irresitible. This album also takes on more of a personal aproach. Maybe Luther wants us to know that he is only human!!!! Keep up the excellent work Luther."
3,a soulful CD,"This music is a little different from Luther's usual stuff. It is worth a listen, if you are in the mood for a newer sound from him."
3,Not his best but better than average,"While this wasn't his best work, I did enjoy the CD. Religion was the stand out track for me. It just made so much sense. If you are a Luther Lover like myself you will enjoy this CD. I dont' think any of the songs can be found on his compilation Cd's"
5,I don't usually buy products like this shaving ...,I don't usually buy products like this shaving cream but I thought it would be a change to Test Drive it. I loved it. It went on smoothly and made shaving a lot easier. Beats soap any old day. I also liked the light peach scent. I can't wait to try the other scents.
5,Works great,"I definately would recommend getting the car charger for everyone with an S105, it works great and I haven't had any problems. Great product, charges fast and easy to use. No complaints"
4,"Fast recharges, very convenient.",Bought this for my new S105 Samsung..provides quick recharge on the road. Does the job well..only drawback is...its a bit bulky..other than that works perfectly fine.
3,Samsung Car Power Charger for Samsung S105,It takes about 2 hours to recharge S105 fully. Is it a standard time required? Shall we all share this experience?Thanks a lot.
4,A good educational product,I used this book for my 5th graders who are all on different reading levels. It was effective for differentiating social studies curriculum to a diverse group of students. I have other books from this series and they are all very good.
3,Misters are good but not great,"When I started looking for misters I read early on in reviews of products that brass heads were the best. I thought that was what I was ordering when I bought this system. It wasn't until I went back and looked at pictures that I realized they were plastic and I was wrong. Overall the system was easy to install and works pretty well although it does seem to put out too much water from each head leaves puddles pretty quickly under each head.The vendor Drip Depot is awesome though, there was a manufacturer defect in my kit that was taken care of quickly and easily by Drip Depot."
1,junk,"this product is very cheap made, leaks like crazy, hose busted in several places, would not refer this product to anyone, cost me $32.00 with shipping, total waste of my money"
1,Don't waste your money......................................................,"Extremely dissatisfied with this repair manual for the following reasons:- Illustrations are extremely dark. Difficult to see parts.- Black lettering on dark background. Cannot decipher name of the part.- Instructions without illustration. For example I needed to replace water pump for my Force outboard engine. The second instruction step said to ""Mark Shift Rod Location"". Without an illustration have no idea where the shift rod is and secondly what am I marking and this was the second step in a 12 step process."
3,book info,The manual went into great detail on everything-----except the one thing I bought it for. I wanted the procedure for adjusting the shift mech and it never mentioned it at all that I could find.
2,Awful!!,"I purchased this manual for my husband. Our Force outboard needed major repairs and, while my husband is handy, he has never torn down an outboard before. The only manual we could find at the time was Seloc and what a waste of money. No pictures to speak of and our particular motor was was rarely referred to, talked about or pictured. Not a good choice for first timer's. We have since discovered another manual but my husband managed with this one."
2,Manual covers to many models,"Although this manual covers the major topics. Force has made to many changes over the years covered by the manual. There are also to many HP models covered as well. The instructions are more generic, often showing a picture of an 80's era motor while trying to describe a 90's era procedure. I have worked on my own vehicles for years using shop manuals. This one confused the heck out of me, and outboard motors are no high performance v-8 car engine."
4,Boat repair manual,A good source for repairs but a little hard to understand. Pictures in black and white and products slightly outdated.
5,Great Book!!,"If you're feeling down about life then this is the book you should turn to for inspiration and motivation. I stumbled on this book in a library and just couldn't put it down. Jim's philosophy for achieving success are excellent, and I try to live them everyday of my life. Of all the books I've read, none has had a greater impact on my life than this one. I highly recommend this book if you want to change your life for the better."
5,EXCEPTIONAL !!!,THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BUSINESS SELF-HELP BOOKS ON THE MARKET. READING OR LISTENING TO JIM ROHN IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENT A PERSON CAN MAKE TO GET AHEAD IN BUSINESS OR IN LIFE. A MUST HAVE!!
5,Great book to get unstuck in your life!,This book moved me from the starting line to take off. You always here what you should do as far as setting goals and so on but this book shows you how. It is a personal guide book for me and I've bought it for others who want something more from their lives.
5,Reading for self improement,"I have not yet cracked the cover, but I know that it is going to be an awsome book. Jim Rohn was one of the most sought afterspeakers on self improvement and I love to listen to him speak."
5,Amazing,"The book came to me brand new and was an excellent read. I recommend to anyone who is looking to succeed in life to read this book. The basics, discipline, goals and living life well are all part of the reading material which are eccential to living a fulfilled life. I love the fact that Jim accepted his mentors advice but admitted did not do it without some struggles. Excellent!"
4,The SInging Machine Karaoke is so much fun!!,"Bought for my 12 year old daughter's birthday and she loves it!! It is so easy to use and hook up to our home theater system. She had a birthday party with 16 girls and it was a huge hit. Love how it is so small and lightweight, easy to transport. Great machine. The camera isn't the best picture but kids think it is fun. Had so much fun that we had to buy an additional microphone so 2 can sing at the same time. Great machine for the value. Highly recommend it."
2,Not a real quality product,"Item was received a few days before Christmas and seemed to work OK when first checked. However the camera had very low resolution and the CRT monitor (Black&White) is very limited in contrast, brightness and sync stability. When really used the first time, the video output jack was connected to a TV and I immediately found that the monitor video slide switch was intermittent and caused the video output to the TV to fail. I plan to return the item for a replacement and I might even consider up grading to a better machine."
3,Karaoke Machine,When I got this item it worked well. All of a sudden the screen stopped working and the cd slot will no longer open. Not sure what happened. I liked it because it had the screen with it.
2,Not as it was advertised,"When I ordered this Karoake system, I thought it was a great value for what I was suppose to get. I was suppose to get the Karoake system and 3 Karoake DVDs. When we received the package, there were no Music Cds with it. The company was pretty prompt about returning my email and letting me know that it was not set up on Amazon properly and was suppose to only be 1 music DVD and then they quickly mailed it to me. I'm not sure that I would have purchased this item through Amazon.com had I known I was only receiving 1 CD/DVD. I think I could have purchased the same item or a comparable item at a lesser price."
4,A movie about reality for one girl...,"I saw ""Yellow Earth"" in a Chinese film class, and instantly liked it. It's the story of a man ""collecting folk songs"" from the common people, who encounters and stays with a family, affecting all of them - including a young boy that's developmentally slow and especially, a teenage girl that wants something more out of life... Sad at times, and subtle yet entertaining, I highly recommend this film."
5,one film two endings,"A wonderful film, it has some moments which are truly moving. One caution, however, do not see the version shot for the ""mainland"" Chinese audience as, in deferrence to filial piety, it pretty much guts the film for western viewers."
5,Great Picture and Easy to Operate,"I did a lot of research while hunting for the best quality vs. price combination TV/DVD/VCR for my bedroom. The new (thin) flat screen TVs I considered all had a negative comments in one way or another about picture quality and/or durability. I decided to go with this much less costly older model--it is heavy and large--but the picture and sound are crystal clear and the operation is so simple, even I can operate it without having read the instruction manual. Shipping was minimal and I have no regrets on selecting this older TV/DVD/VCR over a plasma or similar newer models."
5,Huge Bass,"Being an avid listener of Digital Hardcore Recordings, I am always on the lookout for fresh material to keep me interested in the genre. As such, Fatal Recordings are an offshoot of DHR and I started purchasing albums. This album has its moments, most notably track 3, ""Isn't Frantic Enough!!!"". Tis a rare day I can shake the walls with some super-deep bass! Finally a track that shakes the dust off my subwoofer! The rest of the album is decent, although after a week of light listening I have no desire to play any of them except specifically track 3. I'll give a month or two and play it again to see how I feel. After all, it took me over a year to develop a taste for Mindless Self Indulgence..."
2,Alert! No Gillette here!,"Greetings. William Gillette, the legendary stage Holmes, is nowhere in evidence on this disc. It's full of several of the Ronald Howard TV series.Keep looking."
4,Art & Reality : The New Standard Reference Guide and...,"I, unfortunatly, bought this book in a school store, and therefore paid too much, but the information contained within this book is well worth the expense. Abbott gives great advice about getting your career going in some unusual, ""back door"" ways that most students as well as artists have probobly never thought of. There is a long section of contacts, great ideas on funding and sponsorship, as well as some rather humbling advice when it comes to our field. Most of us want to start out in the world with a good job and a fairly well planned future, this book is a great tool for achieveing those goals, and a reliable source for new directions when all else fails."
4,Best Book by Mr. Chapple,"Mr. Eliot Chapple, recently passed away, is my grandfather. This book gives an indepth and scientific look into biological culture and life. This book is intense and an amazing account on life. Excellent book!"
5,Brings back memories,"I had previously purchased this book...actually 15 years ago, when it was published. My guess is a house guest enjoyed it so much, she took it home, never to be seen again! I enjoyed it so much I just had to have it again.This is a very thorough look at the first 30 years of DOOL; the cast of characters, and the actors who have portrayed them; the plots.A great 30 year history of the show - lots of fun."
2,PRETTY PACKAGE - BUT VERY INCOMPLETE,"Dust cover, binding, paper, photos (the ones they have), all very nice. HOWEVER, the authors leave out some of the most crucial things. For example: dates - it usually doesn't say who was on when! It also leaves out the best storylines, plots, best cameo appearences. Seems like it was written by the Sisters for Eternal Virginity and Stupidness. Anna gets sidestepped. I don't see anything about her Mustang commercials or Dynasty. Kristin Alfonso seems like an occasionnal actress when in fact the movie revolves around her! Really shameful."
2,There are better sources of infor....,"Nice pictures, backstage stuff, and actor interviews, but bad synopsis... too confusing and missing a lot of details. Check out Dustin's Days Page and Beth's Days Page for full, well-written Days history."
3,it was ok,it is ok but it needs to be updated it now. so dont but it till thrycome out with a new one ok
4,Days of Our Lives book review,"I got the 30th anniversary book because I've only been watching Days for a few years and wanted to know the backstories. I was very impressed. It gave very detailed information and the photos were wonderful!The only problemm I have with it is that it ran a little long in places. What I mean is, a paragraph could go on forever, which made it easy to lose my place. But I really recommend this book to newbies who'd like to know more about the history of this great show!"
1,Did not fit,This cross reference for this item said it would fit my 2001 F-150. IT DID NOT FIT. I don't know if it was Amazon or the manufacturer. I return it for a refund.
5,Excellent follow-up to Don't Tell Me You Do,"After listening to this CD for a few days, and belting out my own customized versions of the songs in the car during rush hour I've decided that this album is most definately a winner! Although the songs kind of need to grow on you, once you get the main melodys and start tearing apart the complex vocal parts they become very interesting and beautiful. I certainly hope that a group as talented as Rockapella can finally find their way into mainstream music and help to drown out most of the pathetic drivel on the radio these days! Good job guys!"
3,The best that pop vocal has to offer...,"...even if it's not the band's strongest. As others have said here before me, the talent collected here is unparalleled (yeah, I'd take on Take 6), but despite their long recording history, this still feels like Rockapella's sophomore slump. The songs are good, but not great, and it's missing the furious up-tempo songs that have separated this band from the doo-wop pack. For all that, it's still been the only thing I've listened to this week, and it's more fun to listen to than, say, NSYNC. For fans, it's one for the collection. For newcomers, I'll recommend ""Don't Tell Me You Do"""
2,Not that great compared to Don't Tell Me You Do,"Many people who have given this cd 5 Stars have not heard the album ""Don't Tell Me You Do"" by Rockapella. ""Don't Tell Me You Do"" leaves this cd in the dust and is by far their best cd, and makes this CD sound plain and boring. ""Don't Tell Me You Do"" also includes the vocal percussion, vocal bass, and Folgers song if that's what customers are waiting for. I recommend maybe buying this CD, and then buying ""Don't Tell Me You Do"" and just notice the difference in the quality of the songs."
4,Sean-less Rockapella still the best,"The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because Sean Altman is not on it. His voice, though not as distinct as Kevin's, was one of the main reasons I was a Rockapella fan. He'll always be my favorite, but nothing beats a good-ol' Rockapella CD. I just hope that their long-deserved national attention and radio airplay comes along very soon. They've been too good for too long to not get any recognition. Nobody does the Rockapella style of acapella better!"
4,"Fit Nikoon D90 and accessories, batteries, filters, SD cards","Smaller, but can fit my Nikon D90 with extra 2 batteries, 2 filters plus SD cards. Good for me to take out.The edge of top cover is a little overlap and zipping is not very convenient."
3,cute,I bought these as a Christmas gift for someone with three cats. They are cute and well detailed as depicted in the picture.
1,"Sorry i dont want to wash my body with artificial dyes Yellow 5, and Red 33","If you want to wash your body with dyes your whole life and get cancer have fun, but these chemicals are banned in europe. this garbage should be banned everywhere."
3,Keeps bacne at bay,"I have cystic bacne and this product has helped control it. I can't say it has eliminated it for me, but it does seem to keep it under control which is an improvement, and because of that, I continue to buy it.On a superficial note, I can't stand the smell. It is very medicine-y. I tried the grapefruit wash but (a) it costs $1 more at the drugstore, just for the scent alone and (b) more importantly, it doesn't seem to work as well. I have no idea why since it should be the same product with just a different fragrance. So I went back to the original since it apparently works better (at least for me.)I have heard Neutrogena is coming out with a special body wash using their Microclear Technology called the Power Cream Wash or something like that. It's not yet available on amazon, but I'm hoping to try it when it is. I'd like to see if it can actually clear my bacne."
4,"This is a great product! It smells great, ...","This is a great product! It smells great, and while I don't have an acne problem, my husband does, and he says it works great to help dry up acne. The only drawback is that it seems to dry up your skin a little, but I guess salicylic acid is known to do this. Overall, I'd recommend this product."
2,Did not help my acne,This product dried my skin and did not help my acne at all. I was expecting a better product from Neutrogena.
3,Just okay,Cleans your skin but dries it out without visibly helping complexion. Not very good. I would not buy this product again
3,Works,"This product does what it's supposed to. I don't have a huge acne problem and haven't tried a lot of other products for comparison, but anytime I have occasional break outs this is easy to use and clears it up pretty quickly. Unfortunately it smells pretty bad. I can deal with it though because it's effective and I don't have to use it all the time. I have been wanting to try the pink grapefruit scent but any time I have ever gone into any drugstore anywhere ever it is always sold out. So..maybe one day when they actually start keeping up with the demand I might get to try it."
2,Worsened the problem.,"After using, I actually had more of a problem with breakouts than before. Maybe I'm allergic to something in the product."
4,Neutrogena always maintains high quality in their products ...,Neutrogena always maintains high quality in their products and this one is no different. The body wash had a nice scent and lathered up enough that I didn't have to use much of the product each wash. It didn't dry out my skin like many other products do. I liked this product so much that I had my teenage brother test it because he has some slight acne problems. He reported feeling a significant difference in his skin within a matter of days.
4,"It cleans very well, without leaving any residue. ...","It cleans very well, without leaving any residue. I'm not sure if it really got rid of breakouts on my body, but my skin feels very clean and refreshed. The smell isn't the greatest, but I still highly recommend it."
3,Expectations,"I expected more from this product. Like every other one on the market, it dries your skin. It hasn't worked any wonders for my back, though. So far, it's only making me itchy. I'll finish the bottle. But I won't be re-ordering."
2,Doesn't works for me,"Not working on me .Every thing on my back still the same .Hummmmm.I won't buy it again.Not good bought ,Dispointed"
5,WORKS WONDERS TRUST ME,Let me say that this stuff works very well. I have been having acne of the shoulders and upper arms. I tried changing our shower filter no change. drinking more and better water nothing. We also started making a home made clothes soap but were still having the body acne. It was going to be this or phisoderm we decided to try this. This is the third order and its just about stopped the brakeouts 100% or let me say 90% in the first week. But the ones that do come up are fast to go away and don't develop into real bumps they just go away very fast . I'm not into doing reviews on products but this may help someone the way it has helped us. Also its very soapy with just a little bit. On a body puff a drop turns into alot of lather
3,Dried Out My Skin,"You need to be careful with this product. It really dried out my skin after only a few days. I suppose that's a good thing for certain people trying to fight off acne. I guess I wasn't careful enough while reading the product description, perhaps. Just be aware that this stuff is really only for oily skin problems and the like."
4,Great for KP/Body acne,"I shower twice a day with this stuff. I love it because it has SA in it! I use a loofa and scrub in circles all over my body. I spend an extra min or two on my legs with KP. It makes my body soft and clean.I then soak my skin with Sea Breeze toner (it also have SA).let it airdry, then apply some AHA. I have smooth skin;)"
4,nothing is better for body acne,"I used this a few years ago when I had trouble with back acne and it worked great, clears up oily skin within a week or so of use. I don't know why I stopped using it! Just repurchased and I'm already seeing great results again."
2,ONLY Problems,"We bought this R/C car for my 25 years old b-friend. He had fun with it , but after second week hetared to have problems with the engine. He relaced the engine for almost $230, them he replaced crank case $100 and payed for service at lest $50 every week. Total expence of this toy was over $1000. We bought it for over $600."
5,Knee board Rope,My family's favorite past time is to knee-board. My boys are under the age of 8 and would have difficulty getting up to knee-board if I had not purchased a knee-board that has a latch for this rope. The rope has been used for almost two seasons and has been a fabulous purchase.
4,Great,"Just started reading. Seems like a great book. Very emotional, but I am able to relate and find that there is a positive in every bad situation."
5,Wonderful!,I was read The Bumper Book when I was a little girl and wanted to buy one for my grand children. I looked a lot of places until I found it here. The book I ordered came as described. I am thrilled!
3,better than carrying a pillow,"I bought this for more comfort on those aluminum bleacher seats. It serves it's purpose and is easy to carry, but the back should be higher for more support on the bleacher that have the backs. Again, for the money it works but I will be using these for years to come, so this goes to the grandkids and I will look for a better quality for back support."
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,"Good price, but not exactly what I was looking for. Not enough padding and the back could be a bit higher for support."
1,Did not deliver,I ordered these seats at the beginning of the football season to spare our rear ends in the bleachers. But it has been over 6 weeks since I ordered it and not response to why it is late. The high school football season is almost over and I still have not seen these stadium seats. I don't know if they are still on the way or if they have pulled one over on me. I will keep you informed.
4,I Like This Chair,"Like it but don't love it. First few days while I was still playing with all the adjustments it hurt my tail bone. I either made the necessary adjustments for my sitting comfort or it just needed getting use to. The chair is very adjustable like all the reviews I read. I sit in the chair for 1-6 hours at a time with great comfort. There are a few other chairs I'd rather have but they start at $605.00. For the price I am very happy with the Lorell Executive High Mesh Back Chair. A mesh seat would be better but it's summer in Phoenix right now (115 degrees)and I'm comfortable. After purchasing, the price dropped, so I paid even less than I thought I would.Executive High-Back Chair,Mesh Fabric,28-1/2 quot;x28-1/2 quot;x45,BK."
4,EXACT SAME CHAIR BUT BETTER CHAIR FROM COSTCO,"I was doing my research and I found an exact same chair from Costco, but better built and quality. The Costco's ProGrid High Back Managers Chair has all the features of this chair, plus Seat Depth Adjustment, which is good because you can adjust to fit a taller or shorter person. This one I don't see the seat depth adjustment. Also, the built quality is better. It has Titanium Finish Frames. Of course, Costco's quality is always good. Price is about the same, plus tax it's only $7 higher. I opted for Costco's chair."
2,"You call it lumbar support, I call it THE RACK","The good:1) Only took a few minutes to assemble.2) The seat is padded and goes up and down.The BAD:1) The back is not adjustable. The lumbar curve is so deep, it pushes my stomach forward. Your shoulders will never touch the back of this chair unless you can bend like a pretzel.2) Anything more then a few minutes in this chair is painful. I spend more time adjusting an fidgeting then sitting. My upper back has started hurting just typing this review!I'd pass on this and find a chair with and adjustable back."
2,Uncomfortable,We bought this chair because of the good reviews but turned out to be very uncomfortable for us. Different people in the family tried before returning the chair and all had problems. It gave me a lower back pain. The chair didn't support my lower back as well as my old chair. This chair goes back and my old chair is back in use for many more years :)
2,Not for me; narrow and just couldn't get comfortable,"Ok; this chair was just not cut for me. I'm 6""1, 220lbs. It appeared very narrow and does not rock once you set the angles. That was a big negative for me. For a high back there really was not high enough to lean my head back on. I really just couldn't get the seat comfortable and then the lift started malfunctioning. So I returned it, another headache, I'm a seasoned engineer, but once the lift is locked in it is near impossible to remove to pack back up. I actually had to leave it in and ship. what a packing headache. I ended up going to Office Dept and bought a Thomasville big and tall office chair w leather, memory foam seat, adjustable arms, adjustable rocker, good up to 350Lbs (better support structure) and certified by the American Chiropractors Association. It was a little more at $219 but this seat was the one for me and still is as I set in it and type this."
2,Arrived With Broken Bottom Piece,It seemed like a return item and repackaged to be sold as new. All pieces we dusty.The bottom piece was broken I did not want to deal with return I let it go.
5,Amazing,"This is a great chair. It's got breathability, it's comfortable, its sturdy. It's a great chair. Think about how much time you spend in your desk chair. Get a good one."
3,Seat Uncomfortable,"Seat is not very comfortable. Not only isn't it comparable to an Aeron chair (which I wouldn't really expect at this price), it is less comfortable than other chairs in its price range. Both the mesh seat of an Aeron chair and the padded seats of inexpensive chairs I own are more comfortable.Position can be changed easily due to separate controls for height, seat angle, and back angle. Does not recline by leaning back--have to reset angle of seat or back and lock in place at a different position. It can also be locked with chair tilting forward, simulating one of the features of Aeron chairs. Arm height is also adjustable.It was easy to assemble using a screw driver and a tool supplied with the chair. If you like the mesh look then it looks ok. Personally I don't especially like the mesh look but accept it on a true Aeron chair as they are so comfortable, but it is pointless on a chair such as this without the advantages of an Aeron chair."
2,Comfortable but defective seat angle adjustment,"Unless I sit down very carefully, the seat angle adjustment releases and I have to readjust it. THe chair is very comfortable but the above problem is very annoying,"
2,Looks can be deceiving,"I am a regular shopper at Amazon and I have to say that I have never received a product so badly packed. When I received this chair, I almost didn't have to open the box, the chair pieces were almost out of the box. Few of the pieces were scratched.After assembling the chair, I realized that it is not a solid product. There is constant squeak to it. Every time I move it makes this sound with is really annoying. The armrest wobble a lot and sometimes tend to slip down. The only good thing is the meshed back which helps the back to remain cool, other than that there is nothing cool about this chair."
1,Height support failed winthin 6 months,"Height support failed within 6 month of purchasing.No warranty listed?Is customer over 190 lbs and damaged this chair? nope, truth.Height support seem leaking gas or pressure, that normally happened on over year or few years old chairs, but it should not failed within 6 months. If this chair failed mechanical or broken part at least reach 1 year, I will not this unhappy.I bought a cheap version $99 chair(all in one piece if you go to frys)with same type of height support mechanical from Frys. A cheap chair can last over 4 years even after the cushion broken and peek off, the height support still good on the $99 chair.Please keep good quality control on a chair that cost over $140"
2,Crummy Packing,"The chair came in a big, strapped box. I can't tell if all the parts are there because there's nothing to compare them to. There's NO INSTRUCTION SHEET OR BOOKLET with such information on it. Also, there is not an accompanying package of screws, etc. to put the thing together. Now, I have to contact the manufacturer and get these things. Not good. Update 7/23/12 Amazon quickly accepted my complaint and set me up for a replacement. I threw together the parts of the chair sent to me in the same manner they were packed, and I'm awaiting pick-up from UPS. UPS will have a label, and there is no charge to me."
3,not as comfortable as i wished,"for the price i paid, i figured this chair would have better back tilting tension. when i lean back, it just reclines to the furthest point and its hard for me to balance a point in between."
4,Lorell 86200 Executive Chair,"Read over several recommendations on this chair before I decided to buy, since I spend 7-8 hours per day on sitting at desk. This really improved on how I feel during the day and when going home. Well worth the $165 I spent for this chair."
5,good for the back,I got this chair for superior back support. This chair is the best I've had for the back pain. I'm happy with it.
3,Lorell Executive Chair,"Everything was fine until I tried to connect the backrest to the seat. The bolt, nut, and washer would not connect the seat to the backrest. The chair was defective (the connection from the seat to the backrest), had my brother help me put it together and tried for 2 hours to fit the seat to the backrest, but to no prevail. Plan on receiving a refund for this.My first shipment was mia never found out what happened to it so amazon sent me a second one that was delivered exactly 2 days later. Thanks amazon for your kindness this is no way your fault for the faulty chair."
2,Get the Office Star chair instead,"I was looking for an ergonomic chair like the Office Star's that we have at work. My old leather desk chair was too cushy and I had hoped this new mesh chair would have more back support. I've had the Lorell Executive High-Back Chair for a week now, and it's mediocre at best.For all the adjustable pieces this thing has, I just couldn't get comfortable in it. In addition to that, the arm rests were tiny and wouldn't sit straight in the base of the chair.I'm returning this and buying an Office Star Space Professional Air Grid Back Managers Chair for $10 more."
3,"Good chair, tempurpedic smell","I work in an office environment so I am use to some fairly good office chairs from Steel Case (Leap Chairs) so I didn't expect anything like that, but I did expect something better than what I could get at a office store.One of my main requirements is that the chair either did not have arms or had arms that could be detached. This chair has simple screw on adjustable arms which made me happy.The chair has three adjustments: height, back support tilt, seat tilt. I found the back support and seat tilt kind of funky (seat tilt isn't too smooth of an adjustment and you will need to re-adjust the back tilt).The chair has a smell which reminds me of my Tempurpedic mattress when I first got it. The smell in my Tempurpedic went away after a few weeks, so I'm waiting for a few weeks but I can see how some people can be turned off by this."
4,Comfy with a catch,"Great price and really comfortable - the mesh backrest is very supportive and the armrests are well padded.The tilt action, however, is not spring-loaded (just a caveat in case you were expecting it) so you can either lock the tilt position fore/aft or let it ""float"" free - more expensive chairs will often have an adjustable spring to resist the backward lean.Likewise, the armrests only have up/down adjustment, no fore/aft and the width must be adjusted with a knurl under the base of seat.Assembly was a breeze.It's good and sturdy - worthy of a Led Zeppelin roadie tossing it through a hotel plate glass window. But those were usually TVs not office chairs :)"
1,Poor Quality and Design,"I would give this chair less than one star if possible. The description and price make the chair attractive. After receiving this product last year as a gift, I have done my best to use it and try to ignore the discomfort and poor quality but I have to urge you as a potential buyer to look for something else. It is not comfortable for me to sit in this chair for long periods of time. I'm a computer programmer and need to spend at least six hours a day in my chair. When you initially sit in the chair, the mesh back will pull your shirt up. Should you ever sit in the chair wearing something like a t-shirt, it feels like a cheese grater running over your skin. The seat doesn't have enough padding. After almost a year of use, I feel like I'm sitting on a board now. Both foam arm rests have broken. Don't waste your money or comfort on this horrible chair."
5,Great Support,"I have a bad back. Specifically, i have a form of kifosis (think the opposite of scoliosis). I need great ergonomic back support, or else I tire quickly and get pains.This chair is relatively cheap and provides great lumbar support for you back. The mesh is firm, but yields just enough to form to your back. It's already making me sit up straighter.It took me about 15 minutes to put together, so assembly was fairly easy.tl;dr: I recommend this chair for people with back pain. Thumbs up."
3,Clunking at base,"I like the chair, but there's a clunking sound starting at the base, when you lean forward and back it makes the noise."
4,Solid chair,I purchased this chair for my home office and spend about 20 hours a week in it. It's holding up well and provides the proper adjustment options for my frame. It's not luxurious nor loaded with options but a solid chair that I enjoy to work in.
4,nice chair,"What it is: Desk chair, 5 castors, air-mesh backing, foam seat; nicely adjustableThe open mesh back is great, the seat is comfortable, assembly was easy. The castors work well on standard chair mats, the pneumatics are solid.Many chairs use a spring-loaded ""rocker"" to let you rock-back, this back locks into position. I had thought that would be a negative but I don't really miss it; the back is very firm but is also fairly flexible. For the price, it's excellent.The mesh-back is great for ventilation, but the foam seat completely lacks ventilation. Real air-chairs also have a mesh-seat which makes summertime much more survivable. This seat will give you ""sweaty-butt"" in the hot season because of lack of circulation. Given that air-chairs with mesh seats are much more expensive, this is a very reasonable alternative."
1,What a waste of money!,"I received the chair in good time. Had to put it together, which was no problem. The chair, however, wasn't worth the money. I could have gone to the local Staples (etc.) and purchased a far more comfortable chair for half the price! Not only is it uncomfortable, it clunks and pops when I lean back in it. I am not a heavy person...I weigh 170 lbs. It hurts me to have spent this much money and end up with a product that, quite frankly, sucks. Don't buy this chair. Better to go to Walmart or Target."
1,this is broken chair,"i think this chair is expensive. and i get a broken chair. i think maybe it's used. and when express company send to me. the box was broken. because i am a international student, and my english is poor, and when i retuen it i will spend a lot of time and i will not have chair to sit. so i don't exchang it."
1,"Bad product, bad packaging: returning","I received the chair in a box that was thoroughly crushed. The plastic casing on the bottom of the chair had a crack running its entire length. The large screw that is supposed to attach the chair back to the chair seat was so small that none of its threads could even touch the hole in the chair seat. Presumably some of these parts were meant to go with a differently sized chair? Anyhow, I'll be returning this damaged, impossible to assemble chair."
2,This Chair...,"I am a little disappointed with this chair. It is more comfortable than the average computer chair, but its really not as good as described here. It is sturdy and feels ok, but not comparable to the aeron AT ALL. It also looks cheap and dated... Thats why is ""cheap"" although for me 160.00 for this chair is too much. I would maybe invest a little extra to get something better."
4,"Comfortable, adjustable, but terrible packaging.","Upon opening the package, the arm rests were not even wrapped in plastic and were just hanging next to eachother so they were scratched. the chair itself is comfortable and very adjustable, so I guess that's what matters. the armrests are what they are, as people have said.The mesh back isn't cheap quality, it keeps you from getting sweaty in a texas summer :)Overall, the chair is good for the price you pay."
4,Its a chair,"I have the 700$ version of this chair at work, so its hard to review with out bias. That being said for the price its not bad. Its equal to any chair in the price range concidering quality models. There are lots of crap at this price range, so far Im happy with it and consider it a good buy.If you sit for long durations be advised it will hurt your bottom. The cushion is were they skimed on. I am thinkin of taking mine apart and adding a better cushion."
3,Not good for tall people,I got this chair based on all the positive reviews. It is in fact build very sturdy and has a great feel on the back and cushion of the seat. My complaint is that the chair doesn't go nearly high enough. The chair I'm replacing goes up another 4 inches higher than this chair. Luckily I was able to lower my wall-mounted desk to put the desk at the height that would fit this low chair. 3 stars for good quality but poor design in that it won't go high enough.
4,Good Chair,"I got this chair for my husband to use in our home office. He is a pretty tall and solid guy, and the chair suits him well. It's tall enough for him to sit without his legs bent awkwardly. I was nervous about buying this chair without having him sit in it first, but it has been a great purchase.As it is a home office chair, he is not usually in it for long stretches, but it's perfect for shorter days or even when he needs to be in it for several hours. We have it on a carpeted floor and it hasn't damaged the fibers. We're not sure how it handles being rolled around, though, as he doesn't need to roll around on the carpet.The assembly was a piece of cake, even for a not-so-handy girl like me. That's a big plus."
5,Great adjustments...15 minute setup...very comfy,Received this product in a big box ... it was packaged very well ... instructions were minimal but good enough to get this wonderful chair assembled. I am very cost conscious but don't mind spending money on things I find will work great for me and my intended purpose and for under $200 ...this chair works ... it nicely adjustable...the seat is comfortable and so is the positions for my back. I highly recommend this over other high priced chairs of similar styles ... setup is a breeze and the build quality feels strong and sturdy and the wheels roll very well. No negatives here...
4,some smell,"there is some smell. but except for that, the product is very good. set up in 20 minutes. very comfortable to sit in. generally a good chair for the price."
4,It is not bad!,"I put this chair together in 30 minutes. This chair looks solid, and so far it is quite comfortable. I hope it will stay this way."
5,love these chirs,Have 11 of them and waiting on 25 more to come. easy to put together and nice to sit in
4,Comfortable and affordable chair,"As a college student, a comfortable chair is a necessity. I bought this chair after reading the many favorable reviews. I can now say, after having this chair for a week, that I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The chair has four adjustments (back angle, tilt, height, armrest height) and the first three can be locked in any position in its range of motion.However, the cushion has a strong smell similar to that of memory foam. The odor has dissipated considerably, though."
5,What a comfortable chair!,"I am tall with long legs and have never found a home office chair that fit me that didn't cost over $1k until now. This one works great. I didn't use the original casters that cam with the chair because of the wood floor in my office. Instead I use the previously purchased Rolland Office Chair Caster Wheel for Wood Floor - Stem Diameter: 11mm, Stem Length: 22mm - 5 Unit/Pack from Amazon. The combination is perfect. I can still scoot around the office in the chair without marking the floor and now for long periods and all without breaking the bank."
5,"Very comfortable, amazing customer service from manufacturer","The chair is VERY comfortable and the adjustments on it make it even better. Unfortunately, my chair arrived with one of the adjustment levers completely shattered. I contacted the manufacturer through email about the lever and asked if I could receive another -- within 2 days a new lever was in my mailbox, amazing. I swapped the lever out and the chair is now brand new again! Between the comfort of the chair and the quality of the manufacturer, I will definitely purchase items from them in the future."
5,Very comfy computer chair,"It is probably the best computer chair I've ever sat in or used. It is extremely adjustable (even the angle at which you are stilling, as well as the back-rest and height). The mesh back is comfortable and so is the seat itself. I bought it after my last good computer chair wore out and it definitely lessens fatigue if you are sitting for a long duration.My only knock against it is the mesh back is tacky and will grab your clothing. So if you plop down sloppily into the chair or slouch as I do, it will lift your shirt. It definitely is annoying. But for me, it is no deal-breaker, and I simply lay a blanket over the mesh."
3,great chair if you are not too short!,"Chair is very comfortable, easy to put together and attractive enough. Being 5'1"", however, I find the lumbar support doesn't line up properly and I need a cushion on the seat for it to feel like a proper fit. If you are taller, would highly recommend!"
3,Mostly comfortable,The chair itself is pretty nice. With an extra comfortable seat. Really like the way the see through back looks. Wish the arms were more adjustable. Width only adjusts maybe an inch.
4,Does the job!,"For the price, this chair really gets the job done. It has a real sturdy build, a nice mesh back, and a relatively comfortable cushion. The arms on the chair get the job done, though they can be a bit wobbly. One thing I found the chair to be missing is the ability to rock back and forth. Most chairs these days come with this as a standard feature. If you're in the market for a good task chair, pick this one up. If you're looking for a lounge chair, look elsewhere."
3,"Good working chair, not so good relaxing chair","Main negative is that it does not have much of a reclining position - seems good for working at computer, but less okay for watching a movie or reading - I find myself switching chairs."
2,chair quality,i got this chair four months ago since them it has not stopped creaking in all directions tightening lubrication adjustments have not helped i woud caution you about quality from this vendor
5,A chair that makes a lot of difference,"This chair rocks! The separate controls for seat and back are just what I need. I can unlock the levers, put the chair in the most comfortable position, and fixate the levers in that position. Working at my desk is so much more comfortable now."
3,"Great chair, questionable quality","I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, but I'm disappointed in the longevity of this chair. Less than 6 months from purchase and there is significant ""give"" when resting against the back rest, and my left arm rest has ripped through to the metal. I weigh 225 lbs at 6'5"" and while this chair has helped my posture significantly, I'm giving it a 3-stars for as I can foresee having to replace it altogether next year. I'm going to contact the Manufacturer to try to get a replacement arm rest - will update my review on the service of the company."
4,Its a pretty good char.,The armrest are cheap plastic/rubbery feel. But after using a day they are not as sticky.The seat cushion is very firm. But it feels comfortable. I'll need to break it in a bit to see how it works out for me. Everything is very adjustable. Build quality seems pretty good.Came with a very strong plastic/oil smell that cleared after a day.Took 5 mins to put together. I only looked at instructions to see if arms were side specific.Shipping? I ordered this Saturday night and it arrived Tuesday.
3,Manufacturing Defect,"Chair has great reviews on other sites and was mostly comfortable to sit in and a great value. Only complaint, which was ultimately a deal killer, was that that the back support was not aligned with the seat. Resulted in my upper body twisting slightly to the right when I sat in the chair. The chair itself appears to be well-received in general but perhaps the 2 that I ordered from 2 different sellers were from a defective batch. More a result of shoddy manufacturing than shoddy design."
4,Decent Chair,"It is a pretty decent chair, but the back is not as sturdy as I expected. The arms are pretty wobbly too. The chair itself is pretty comfortable, I just don't know if I'd buy it again at this price (it was $189.44 at time of writing)."
1,do NOT buy this chair,this has got to be the worst chair I ever bought. Not sure how any of you put this together in 10 minutes but I spent 2 hours trying to assemble this chair and it was not worth it at all. The arm rests are extremely flimsy and the screws that they came with don't even fit so I had to use screws I had laying around and It's not even comfortable. Returning it now.
2,"back don't move up or down, but in front back","back don't move up or down, but in front back. Everything move on this chair, except the most important, the back doesn't move from the vertical, what is the most important part of a chair..."
5,Handles aren't as bas as others say they are,"The chair is great -- not just for its price, it's great, period.The handles are not loose, you just have to make sure you put them in on the right track. The first time I put them in, they were hard to tighten too."
3,"Mostly decent, but lacks range of motion","I ordered this based on the reviews, and some people do love the chair. For me, the chair was easy to put together as everything was included. However, I found two problems. First, the chair does not seem to rise as high as other chairs, which is a minor issue for me. However, the biggest issue is that when the seat is released, it doesn't rock back very far--the seat hits the stops just past horizontal so it feels like it only rocks half way. I find that annoying. The back doesn't provide any support when unlocked, and you can't change the support tension for the back. All in all, I will choose another chair next time."
4,Very good value,"This chair is a very good value. I've used Aeron chairs at work for many years and like them. However, the price is steep for home use. I have used this chair now for almost three months and it is comfortable throughout those full days in the home office. It is also easier to adjust quickly compared to the Aeron chair. I particularly like the fact that both back position and seat angle can be adjusted to maintain good posture. The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the seat is fabric covered and I suspect it will be more difficult to maintain over time."
3,Back of chair hard to assemble,This chair is very heavy- assembly with a co-worker/friend is helpful. The back is very hard to slide down into the seat connection. The advice I can give for success is to wiggle it down with some pressure. The assembly instructions are not helpful as to attaching the back. JB
2,Power Rangers Time Force- Force From the Future,This video is about the power rangers time force.When an evil villian named Ransik escapes from the future he immediately goes on a rampage.Thank goodness for the time force rangers (rangers from the future) who want to stop Ransik at all costs.Plus the time force rangers have to recruit a new ranger Wes the eventual red ranger.Movie is ok but is on no level like mmpr or power rangers zeo!
3,"Great, but then gets increasingly worse...and then better!","I was at Big W when I saw this: Power Rangers TimeForce, and I'm like ""OH COOOOOLLLLL!"", so I buy it. I watch it with my Ranger-mad bro, who could'nt sit down. It starts out with us meeting the Rangers, Ranzik, etc, with all these wierd action scenes, etc, and I mean 'the special FX maybe something, but we've seen so much of this kind of kiddies action before (in six seasons on PR)!'. But then Alex kicks the bucket. Now, THAT'S something we've never seen before!! The episodes continue as a rollercoaster, it's dumb, then good. It's somehow the best series yet. And the rangers themselves are rollercoasters aswell, example: Trip is the nicest & coolest Ranger ever, Jen's a cow, Wes is really sincere, Lucas is stuck up, and Katie's, well, in between. So, all in all, buy it, Ranger-fans, but just hire it the people not to sure on rollercoaster TV."
5,Great fun for little rangers!,"As hokey as they may be, the Power Rangers provide great fun and lots of inspiration for imaginative play for my 5-year-old. He and his friends have watched this movie countless times and act it out as it plays on, but even better, he makes up his own versions away from the vcr. I hear him learning the tough talk but using it in appropriate ways -- and with hokey humor, too. (e.g., before the garbage truck arrives, he turns and says, ""OK garbage can, your time is UP!"") When watched *with* the kids and when ""power-moves"" are monitored by parents, gearing them to a level of safety appropriate to age, these movies--and the world of Power Rangers -- can be a lot of fun and great food for kids' hungry imaginations!"
3,"Great, but then gets increasingly worse...and then better!","I was at Big W when I saw this: Power Rangers TimeForce, and I'm like ""OH COOL!"", so I buy it. I watch it with my Ranger-mad bro, who could'nt sit down. It starts out with us meeting the Rangers, Ranzik, etc, with all these wierd action scenes, etc, and I mean 'the special FX maybe something, but we've seen so much of this kind of kiddies action before (in six seasons on PR)!'. But then Alex kicks the bucket. Now, THAT'S something we've never seen before!! The episodes continue as a rollercoaster, it's dumb, then good. It's somehow the best series yet. And the rangers themselves are rollercoasters aswell, example: Trip is the nicest & coolest Ranger ever, Jen's a cow, Wes is really sincere, Lucas is stuck up, and Katie's, well, in between. So, all in all, buy it, Ranger-fans, but just hire it the people not to sure on rollercoaster TV."
1,wouldn't recommend this product,"I've been using this brand of supplements for decades. Thought the diabetic in me might benefit from this particular item. Not altogether sure but think the sudden rise in blood glucose that followed over a few days' taking it resulted from this tablet. Stopped taking it. Blood sugar returned to something more manageable. Inductive reasoning isn't always scientific, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."
4,Return of the beat,"A bit of beat poet style seemed to be present in this book which creatively described the facets of one person's life. It reminds us all of the different aspects of our lives yearning to be set free, the author takes a look at what happens when one person's life does, in fact, free itself in three seperate direction."
1,Not satisfied,I was very disappointed due to the fact that I was sent a cassette instead of a CD. I didn't go back and check who made the error but I guess easy come easy go. It would cost more to send it back then to keep it.I just won't be able to ever listen to it because I do not have a cassette player!
5,Not Amazing but Great!,3 reasons why you should buy this Album1. Great vocals2.Great guitar playing3.All original Grunge Metal baby!!
4,Masterfully Elelgance,"Alice in Chains/Facelift is straight ahead rock meating the dark side of Black Sabbath twenty years later. AIC is a unique group amoung rock/metal. The first few times this album is heard it may sound dull, it gets better each time until it becomes a classic on anyone's list who appreciates music. The diversity of this album is unlike anything I have heard. The darkness is so appealing for the first time since Ozzy set foot on stage. But for a real discription, the RIF's are somewhat like the new Metallica (the slower Metallica, but still amazing). Anyone looking for a little variety to add to their collection should seriously contemplate purchasing this."
5,Original and Best,"Years ago, MTV played ""Man in the Box"" on Headbanger's Ball and I was intrigued enough to purchase this cassette. Wow! Talk about blown away. While ""Man in the Box"" is very strong, the rest of the album is just as good. If you like this group, you'll understand the perfect combination of powerful metal and harmony (with Layne Staley's unique voice). This is definitely heavier than their later productions (Jar of Flies, SAP). And, for that reason mainly, it is also their BEST."
4,"Decent debut, but ""Dirt"" is much better.","While ""Facelift"" is still a fine album, it just doesn't hang in there with ""Dirt"", their sophomore release. This cut yields some fantastic songs, like ""Sea Of Sorrow"", ""Man In The Box"", ""It Ain't Like That"", ""Sunshine"", ""Confusion"", and ""Put You Down"" (The best, most under-rated song on this album), but it's rather inconsistent, and boring, where ""Dirt"" and ""Jar Of Flies"" are consistent, and exciting. I suggest this album if you are a big grunge fan, (which I am) but, overall, it's just not THAT good. If you want a masterpiece, check out ""Dirt""."
5,GREAT ALBUM,LISTENED TO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. I HAVE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH ALL OF THIS RETARDED NU-METAL AND ROCK RADIO FOR SO LONG I HAD TO FIND IT AND PUT IT IN THE CD PLAYER. REMINDED ME OF HOW ACOUPLE OF BANDS THAT HAVE MAJOR SUCCESS RIGHT NOW HAVE COMPLETELY RIPPED THESE GUYS OFF. I WONDER IF THEY SECRETLY PAY CANTRELL AND CO. FOR THE MAJOR HACK JOB.
5,ALICE'S FIRST ONE,"The often overlooked ""Facelift"" marks the starting point from which Alice in Chains staked a claim in the Seattle scene. Tracks like ""We die young"" and ""Man in the box"" instantly grab the attention, whilst other tracks such as ""Love, Hate, Love"" approach from a slower, more subtle angle but still leave the listener in awe of the haunting but powerful vocals of Layne Staley. Definately a more instantly accessable album than their second album ""Dirt"", ""Facelift""'s slam-bang rock style smacks of late eighties rock, but without the cheesey cliches and an added edginess with a raw sound. Classic stuff from an awesome band, and that's without even going into the classic ""Dirt"" album !!!"
2,for metalheads only,"There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first."
5,This Album Blew me away,"This was the first Alice In Chains album that i got, it was just awesome. I listened to it every free second that i had for about 4 months, at this point I got into the Dirt Album. This album is probably on my top 5 all time favorites, it speaks so clearly. I love it se much because it is more raw, the entire record shows the unpolished side of AIC, which i love because it is a lot of straight forward rock. Obviously ""Man In The Box"" is a classic and its not possible to become tired listening to this song. Though ""Man in the Box"" is the classic, by far my favorite song on the record is ""We die Young"". If you like Alice in Chains even remotely, you will love this record, in my opinion it will stand the test of time forever."
5,A great debut.,"Alice in Chains produced a great first cd with Facelift. Lane Staley's voice coupled with Jerry Cantrell's guitars and lyrics created one the greatest grunge rock bands ever. You won't find a bad song on this cd. For the lovers of true rock, i.e. Metallica, Godsmack, and STP, this cd, along with all of AiC's others, is a must have."
4,Almost as Under Rated as Mudhoney,"This album is one of the most *Under Rated* Seatle albums (besides Mudhoney's ""Tomorrow Hit Today"").My favorite songs on this album are *We Die Young*,*Sea Of Sorrow*,*Love, Hate, Love*,*Sunshine*,*Put You Down*,*Confusion*,*I Know Something (bout you)*, & *Real Thing*. (I'm sure you've heard ""Man In The Box"").This album is my favorite of all their albums. The reason I give it only 4 stars, is because some of the songs I skip over (to me their boring).But for the most part this is a very good album, and like I said very under Rated!! You'll like more songs than you'll dislike. Than again I'm not you.So check it out for your selves!!!"
5,Great Heavy Album,"This is definatly my favorite Alice in Chains Album. Over the past few years I strayed away from rock into hiphop because I started to find it boring. This album however is still one of my favorites.Its full of heavy riffs but isn't repetitive, and Layne (r.i.p) has a great voice. I like this more than dirt, which seems to be their most popular album, because it all the tracks are great, no fillers."
3,Bleach,"I bought this volume mostly to read because I watched the series. The art wasn't that great in this volume, but I think it does get better. I really liked the anime better. This volume did seem slow."
3,"Bleach, Vol. 2 Review",It was okay but I didn't like the fact that the cover was almost ripped off at the seem. There were about 4 rips in the seem it was almost torn off. I'm not sure what it was but the color of the pages were a bit darker then the normal ones I get. And there were tears in some of the pages. I wasn't all that happy with it but I settled for it.
1,No support provided from Samsung,The drive worked sporatically under WinMe (sometimes it read DVD's and sometime it just hangs). When I upgraded to XP it stopped reading DVDs and DVD-ROMs but it did stop hanging so the rebooting went away. Samsung does not support the drive and has removed any support information from thier web site regarding it. Even thier more current drives have very little support information. I would strongly recommend against purchasing any Samsung optical drive because of the lack of support.
4,want but don't have it,this toy looks very neat but i also wonder if it can hold skate wheels not that i'm saying that i have any skate wheels but i do have a regular fly wheel and it look like when it splashes the water you get cooled of
1,Haven't seen this one...,"...so I can only give it one star, cause I don't know what it is about. I have seen VA 1,2,3,5. I would really like to own all of them. But they are so hard to find, and if you do people want too much $$ for their used copies. #6 really just came out, I think in 1998, and I think you can get it direct from the company. These are thte chessiest, most low budget movies around. But they are funny. That is what makes then watchable...and the busty blondes with no tops...hee hee"
4,Would Have Been a 5 Rating Except...,"I found out that this ""CD"" did not contain the full selections from the vinyl record (that I also own). There's a selection missing between ""The Helpful Hitchhiker"" & ""Jimmy Takes Vanishing Lessons"", containing Alfred Hitchcock's comments. I don't know why this was omitted (intentional or not). That said, 2 of the stories will give the kids shivers while the others are humorous with a twist at the end but appropriate for this collection. Even if kids don't know who Alfred Hitchcock is, I'm sure they would enjoy his comments. Listen to this in a dark room."
4,Time for Timex!,"I Bought this watch as a gift for a childs birthday. It went over very well as it corresponded to what the kids were learning in school. Very easy to read and attractive on the wrist. Kids got a kick out of this very functional item. The strap was the only thing that was slightly challenging, that said, highly recommend this item!"
1,very disgruntled,"I was trying desperately to get my 5 year son an ideal watch for his 6th birthday, beeen looking at watches for at least 2years now trying to get the perfect one. Settled on this one because its blue, moderate face size,and band not too slim. However when this watch arrived i could never give a little girls watch to my son, it is the exact oppersite of what i expected(bought). I was mislead into beleiving that this watch was a watch suitable for boys. My son is a boy and will grow up to be a 100% genuine, gentleman nothing other, I HAAAAAAATE the watch."
3,"Entertaining, but not a great work of film","I'm kind of surprised at the fervor of some of the reviews on here. I enjoyed the film and found it amusing in some parts and touching in others. I never laughed out loud or cried and I certainly don't think it's the best film I've seen all year. Still, though, it's a lot better than most of the gay/lesbian films out there, so that's a win. It's a perfectly enjoyable film with a good cast and a decent plot-line. The science referred to in the film *is* theoretically possible, although I would have liked to see a tad more scientific explanation in the film... they're almost throwing away the fact that it is theoretically possible by making the descriptions so vague that anyone who hasn't already read about this suspects it's fake."
3,Scientifically Possible,Good film with a scientifically feasible experiment of a couple of lesbians having their stem cells transformed in spermatozoa and have their own genetical children. It touched both the ethical and human part of such an issue with realistic optimism. I liked the family members of both ladies in the couple. One of them reminded me so much of my mother. Nothing was spared. Lighted hearted to the end.
1,Broke on first catch,Rest broke at the junction of the post and the rest the first time I had a catch. Shocking that Delta can't make something as simple as this.
2,Fragile-- Handle with care,"I turn a lot of bowls, and I love the way the French Curve tool rest fits up inside the bowl, so you hollow it out without the scraper catching. But-- keep moving the rest closer to the bottom of the bowl as you go, keep your scraper sharp as possible, and don't try to remove too much wood too quickly-- because the tool rest can very suddenly snap off the stem."
4,Fast-moning. Reality increased by using real names.,The use of real names and actual locals makes this book move along extremely fast. It reads as though it is actually happening in front of your eyes. The story-line is excellent and believable.
4,"A very hard hitting ""what if?' book that can be learned from",a very exciting read which makes the reader wonder what will happen next and is than surprised. a exceptional book with a couple of technical glitches that make those few like us talk to ourselves and want for more. Can't wait for the next one by Mr. Lichtman.
3,Decent introductory work,"Gitelman's compilation is valuable to historicism, but only to a point. The articles contained therein present perspectives on jewish history not found in other scholarly monographs. The citations in the work are plentiful, and while the works are not long in nature, they do provide an adequate and inciteful look at modern jewish politis. Take, for example, the article by the well-established Gershon Bacon, who argued that Agudah Yisrael actually imitated the politics of its closest rival, the Zionists.While it is true that this is not by any means an authoritative work, it is still valueable and a very quick read. I would recommend it for any undergraduate class, or as light reading for anyone interested in the political agency of the Interwar Jewry of Eastern Europe."
1,Clunky writing and stale topic,I was very excited to read this book but when I finally did I was thoroughly dissapointed by it. I do not recommend this book to individuals or libraries; there is nothing useful or worth reading here.
5,First Class Analysis and Practical Advice,This is a superb book that combines practical experience with meaningful reflection and solid academic research. It is a great guide to leadership and ought to become essential reading for all leaders and aspiring leaders.
5,Great Book,"It is great and very needed book. I wish to have it in Polish. We do not have to many good books about mentoring, I have read few and find Carson's as the one of most important and helpful in my ministry and in leadership development!"
5,An Essential Resource,"Mentoring Leaders is an essential resource for developing leadership through mentored relationships. It serves first as a handbook for mentors; a kind of blueprint to help guide someone through the inevitable phases of discovering who they are, how they are designed and gifted, and what direction they need to pursue. The book is also loaded with experience-drenched wisdom, providing a helpful reference source for insight and encouragement.I equip key leaders in my church with Mentoring Leaders to provide a common paradigm and vocabulary for development. When I have the opportunity to suggest a leadership development resource to someone, this is the first book I mention. (I usually keep an extra copy or two on hand to give away.) There are many great resources available today, but this is the one you should obtain first!"
5,Best for people really interested in Kiswahili. No tourists.,"This is the best book I ever used to study Kiswahili. And I've tried a couple... It is not apt for tourists who just want a quick insight into the Swahili language, but it is perfect for people interested in staying in an East African country. It contains good explanations on grammar, lots of vocabulary and lots of exercises. It teaches you, how to read, write and speak the language in correct grammar using the right words. In short: thumbs up and very recommendable!"
5,The best English-language primer for learning Swahili.,"I used this book throughout my 8-year stay in Tanzania, East Africa. Because Peter Wilson uses a step-by-step approach which fits well with the logical structure of Swahili, this book was most helpful in getting started. Later on, as I gained more language skills, the book helped me learn the finer points of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure. For any traveller to East Africa who plans to stay a while in Tanzania, a good book to add to your library."
5,REALLY NICE GENERATOR,"I just got mine today. Easy to put the wheels and handles on, in less than 15 minutes, had it up and running, STARTED ON FIRST PULL. The generator is reasonably quiet, compared to some I've heard. Powered hand tools just fine, all the switches and controls are convenient and well placed. A well built machine, manual says it has a brushless generator, which tends to be maintenance free. Tires are airless-NO FLATS. Engine is 11 HP, NOT 13 as it says on Amazons title, the weight is also around 200 pounds, not 147 as stated. THIS ENGINE DOES NOT HAVE A SPARK ARRESTOR. If that is important, installation of one shouldn't be too difficult. If the specifications fill the bill for you, do not hesitate, I like mine. FREE shipping was a big plus++++."
5,nice princess wall clock,"I have had this clock for a year and it is in my daughters' room that is decorated in the ""Princess"" theme. Well made and pretty!"
4,Clock is working but design could be better,nice Clock But- Short cord if you wish to hang it on the wall- the pink light make is very hard to read the numbers. My kid think its 0 o'clock when the time is 10 because the pink light covers the 1.
3,"Works well, but connection at spigot leaks a bit","This works well, as long as you don't move it around. There is a swivel at the spigot connection (yello) and that swivel leaks when you move the connection around. Otherwise the four ball valves work great.I recommend this over anything plastic. It has weathered several seasons outside without issue.To be clear, as long as it isn't moving, it doesn't leak."
2,Joe Bloggs who?,"To begin with, the Joe Bloggs approach designed for the retarded is a major flaw in this book. Almost every explanation encountered dealt with this average-student on the SAT who almost always misses the hard questions, thinks like an idiot and scores less than the average on the actual test. Bla bla bla approach which paradoxically (!?) occupies half of this book.The book is filled with all kinds of paranormal approaches, irrelevant references ( the one where you are told to compare the reading section with the tale of a thief who robs banks???)On the other side, there are some things to consider : three almost realistic tests with an experimental section, some hard math questions well worth passing through ( though I noted some errors in giving the right answer...)and excellent reading passages.Yet I cannot help not being haunted by that famous Joe Bloggs whenever I open this book so...Try the College Board book instead."
3,amazing miller anderson tune,Miller Andersons version of don't let me be misunderstood is amazing .That alone is worth buying this disc.Other than that tune I only cared for the mick taylor tune and the jack bruce tune
4,Various artists with great versions of popular blues songs,"This CD should have some real highlights for just about any blues lover. My favorites happen to be Jack Bruce's version of Cyril Davies' ""Send for Me"" and Miller Anderson's rendition of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"". A good CD to put on when you can't decide what to listen to."
4,"Cute, but ...","I love cats, and my favorite color is purple so I was happy to find these - and they were reasonably priced.It would have been soooo much better if the kittens on the earrings were made to face each other (one facing left, one facing right) rather than both pointed in the same direction. I like symmetry and balance. What you don't see in the item photo is the hole in the center of the Amethyst Stone. One of the cats almost covers it, the other is farther up on the stone, making the hole more noticeable. If you are particular about things like this, you may want to write and ask for a better photo of the earrings that will be shipped.I took some digital photos to show the difference, but so far I don't see them posted."
2,GPS device pops out of straps,"The Forerunner 305 stays put in the strap as long as you don't disturb it by sliding a jacket sleeve so you can see the display. If you do, the pins will pop out and one or both attachments come free. Before I could save the attachment pin it dropped out and was lost on the trail. I had carefully made sure the pins were fully engaged in the slots so this was not the problem."
2,Does not work with cradle,"The wrist strap works well on the wrist. But once you want to place the unit on the cradle for charging or dowloading, you can't as it does not fit. Some reviewers say you can slip the cradle between the strap and the unit but this is not possible. I have to remove the unit from the one of the strap sides using the provided tool to place on cradle. I think I will be ordering the original wrist band as my problem was that it broke from overtightening."
1,disappointed!!!,said it was for my forerunner 405 watch. IS NOT. in no way could this be used as a replacement strap. the ends do NOT match up. the original one was stiff and I wanted a softer band- and I have small wrist. waste of my money!! thank goodness I didnt pay much for this.
1,wrong spare parts,They sent me a kit with the tool to remove the spring pins with two extra pins but nothing to clip them into. The band is useless for the 405 unless it was supposed to come with some extra clips. It didn't. Too late to return because I bought it early for a friend's birthday.
4,Using Garmin Velco Wrist Strap,"No instructions with wrist strap . Strap extension included . Bought to use with Garmin bike mount , no reviews as of date of purchase . Works well wearing on wrist ."
2,Fell off,The pins that come with the strap have too much spring/play. They spring themselves right out. Strap came off during an important race.
5,GPS Wrist Fastener,"This strap does exactly what I had hoped it would do. My wrist is small and this kept my watch from swinging in positions that I could not read the stats on my watch. I love it and many ladies have commented on how much they would like to have one, too."
5,Why didn't I order this sooner?,I really love these wrist straps and wish my old plastic strap had broke years ago so I could have been using this one longer. It has a very comfortable fit and you can get it to the perfect size whereby this wasn't always possible with the standard garmin wrist strap.
1,Too big,Too big for a small wrist. Probably works well for larger wrists. Tool did work well and was easy to install.
4,"Would be 5 Stars, if it were a bit smaller","I was really excited to find and buy this strap. I have the Forerunner 305, and the original wristband was starting to crack at the holes. Getting the 305 on was easy, and the charging cradle fits very well between the unit and the strap. However, this band is not made for tiny wrists!! I can barely use it, half the velcro is not attached to the corresponding velcro. There is a good amount of the strap that sticks out awkwardly. I don't know if this is going to be a problem in the long term. I'll continue to try it for now, but I'm a bit frustrated that it doesn't fit."
1,don't bother,Missing many natural sites for example Shannon Falls. Superficial mention of Richmond which has the best Chinese food in the area. The index is supremely awful ... as if completely generated by computer without any human intelligence involved.
2,Disappointed...,"I love travel guide books and depend on them heavily when arriving at a new destination. This is the first time I purchased a Frommer's and I hated it! A major site to see in Victoria is the Buchart Gardens (it's on the cover of the book) but try finding any information about it in the book! No directions on how to get there or anything. The book focused too much on shopping and not enough on sites to see (parks, etc.). Any good shopper can find a worthy store! Buy a lonely planet book on Victoria, if there is one."
2,Disappointing,"The title was not available, but my money was refunded only 4 weeks later. Unbelievable!"
1,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Ever.,"I ordered this book for a friend because it sounded like light-hearted advice. Light-hearted it is, but it gives too much bad advice for me to like it. Any successful relationship needs honesty and she promotes too much deception and dishonesty. There is some good advice, but how are readers supposed to distinguish between good and bad advice. I thought about donating this book to the library, but I wouldn't want to be responsible for giving anyone a chance to read all this bad realtionship advice."
5,Sweet (and strategic) surrender,"Letting him chase you till you catch him has just been brilliantly updated. This book marks the end of serial monogamy and puts the fun back into courtship. Lauren is whipsmart, precient and wise."
5,Move over Cosmo!!,"I was given this book as a ""gag gift"" but let me tell you...what a fun, entertaining and yet insightful book. I read this book in 2 days on a vacation any I would laugh every few pages in which I would read it out loud to my girl friends. I laughed because it was funny AND true! I just bought this for a gift for my cousin who has already read my copy but wanted one of her own for a reference every so often."
1,"The book was never delivered to my home. The company contacted me and after charging my credit card, THEY cancelled the order!!","The book was never delivered to my home. The company contacted me and after charging my credit card, THEY cancelled the order!!"
3,"Fun & unique, but there's better out there--","This book is an enjoyable, sometimes hilarious, read, and brings to light that men dont think the way women do,which I found very intelligent point, but I didnt find much value in it as far as how to catch and keep a man. Though Lauren Frances is quite a mankiller with her looks and adeptness at manipulating (not necessarily in a bad way), I think the books/videos by Ginie Sayles, the trailblazer in catching and keeping a man, is still by far the BEST. I loved How to Marry The Rich (video), which shows not only how to captivate a man, but how to get him to the alter and keep him beyond that. Body language is such a HUGE part of that! Comparing Lauren to Ginie, I would say Ginie has a more genuine (or should I say less detectable) way of relating to men when strategies are involved, and found her (many) books more real world applicable."
4,Not a bad overview of current Atlantis theory,"I was favorably impressed with this book. Having read everything from crazed ravings to dry-as-dust tomes by geologists, Brennan's book comes across as breezy, informative and somewhat sensible. He goes astray at the end, in my opinion, when he poses the possibility of a supernova fragment causing the Atlantis catastrophe. It's really just too wild for me. I'm more inclined to go along with writers such as Andrew Collins who believe Atlantis is sunken in the Caribbean, the victim of a comet strike.Still, this book makes excellent reading. And it's the perfect introduction to the Atlantis question for anyone who's wondering about it."
1,Vela supernova,"The hypothesis this book is based on is that a fragment from a supernova in the constellation Vela played skittles in our solar system some 10,000 years ago destroying the mythical continent of Atlantis and causing major changes on Earth. The author states that the supernova occurred 45 light years from Earth. This is not true. The explosion occurred some 1200 - 1300 light years distant. A fragment would have absolutely no chance of reaching Earth! Sorry mate!"
4,ain't nothing like NYC house,Enters strong and you don't want it to stop! This is house at its best. I would have givin it 5 stars but some of the songs are a little big long(by that I mean too repetitive).
3,OK,"Two great songs, good clarity. It arrived within 9 days of ordering. But I thought it was a copy of the Re-Mix Version that Keith sang on tour and at the Grammy's. A little disappointing."
2,Not worth the money,"This book is absolutely not worth the money. Although some of the content is worthwhile, the formatting makes it virtually impossible to wade through. For example, the text is 14 pt Times, 1.5 line spacing, justified, with no additional white space between paragraphs, so everything runs together. Plus, first level headings aren't always at the top of the page, so you know when a new topic is being started.In my opinion (and I have more than a few years technical writing experience), this whole book could be shrunk down to a 25 page report, using standard fonts and formatting.This author doesn't have a clue as to how to put information into logical, easy-to-follow ""chunks"" that a reader can digest. If this book is an example of his training course writing ability (and that is exactly what it is), I give him a ""D."""
2,Creating Training Courses when you're not a trainer,Poorly designed book (who picked that font?) Difficult to read. It covers the basics but I've seen other books that do the same much better.
1,Best Yet To Come? One Hopes.,"She ain't kidding, the first track, `Give Me Tonight' sounds like a parody of a dance track, the kind of music that SNL skits are made of. The rest of it is only slightly better. Oy Oy Oy. Shannon has a pretty good voice, she deserves better. Miss it."
4,10 major texts analyzed,wonderfully expresses a style of American writing in relation to late nineteenth century fiction movements
5,Tai Chi Music,We use this music during the Short Form of Tai Chi. It enhances the connection to the earth.
5,Most unique sounds.,"In the quest for ""spiritual quality"" in music, this is a new find. Dean Evenson is rapidly becoming one of my sought after artists....as I have Desert Moon Song, as well, and this album is even better, though in a totally different musical sound.The blend of spiritual sounds with far eastern tone and an occasional chant, is a great CD to meditate to, to unwind from your day, or simply to enjoy for it's musical qualities.Evensen really has a feeling for the kind of music that relaxes, pleases, and makes you whole again."
1,Triple Ashley: A Review of Triplcross,"I changed my mind about this film. I absolutely loath it. I think Ashley Laurence's best performance was in Hellraiser. If you want to waste your money on another mediocre film with no artistic merit, then by all means purchase this flick."
1,School Band Trumpet,"This trumpet served its purpose, but it's very poor quality. My son managed to bend his trumpet and caused one of the valves to get stuck. I took it to a music store to see if it could be repaired and because of the low quality construction the trumpet was unrepairable. The service tech was able to polish the inside of the valve chamber so it wouldn't hang up at the point of damage, but any slight buildup inside the valuve chamber would cause the valve to stick again. If your child plans to participate in band for many years look into buying a better quality trumpet. This trumpet is what I would call a ""Disposable instrument"""
4,Vintage Dave Pell-Don Fagerquist velvety smooth interaction,"Fans of the wonderful solo work done by Dave Pell, tenor sax, and Don Fagerquist, trumpet, in the old Les Brown orchestra will love this CD. The smoothly tight voicings of Dave and Don are classic. An added bonus is the inclusion of four cuts at the end by the Don Fagerquist Nonette. In case you aren't familiar with him, Don Fagerquist was an unsung giant in the world of 50s and 60s jazz. This CD shows you why."
3,Useful Charcoal Starter,"This charcoal starter is more useful and faster than just brute force lighting up charcoals on the grill. The one downside is that the first time that I used it, the internal coating/ paint cracked and has fallen off."
2,"Better than none, but not nearly as good as the weber","I bought this model at a local store 3 years ago. This year it started falling apart. The sidewalls are now very thin and have holes in them. The weber chimney charcoal starter is a far better design, with thicker metal and features that allow the charcoal to get ready faster."
2,coasting,"Willie phoned this one in. His style is laid-back and casual, to be sure, but he invested little passion to this collection of songs."
5,love it,"the book arrived quickly & was in great condition, I was very happy with everything, so was the little boy that I gave it too"
5,Zack,I used this book for a homeschooling literature review. It was an easy read for my son and he enjoyed a book he wouldn't normally read.
3,Too much filler - but some truly great songs.,"I had this record as a little kid. I forgot about this band until I saw 'Detroit Rock City' and heard a snippet ""Lights Out"", which is probably one of the best songs ever. I dug up the record. I reminded myself of ""Too Hot To Handle"" and ""Love to Love"", which are also great songs. I had liked ""Alone Again Or"" at the time, but discovered Love's version over the years, and this version comes up a little short. I was inspired to pick up a compilation CD (""Essential UFO"") which had all three songs, plus several other great songs. If this disqualifies me as a true fan, so be it."
5,"Loved it at 15, love it at 40","You have to believe what every one else has said... If I could only own 5 albums, this would be one of them."
2,A little disappointed,"The CD took a month to get to me (29 days). It was a reissue from some ""Classic Rock"" collection not original release or the official Re-release w/bonus material. Shipped in a plain 6x9 envelope so CD cover was broken by the time it get it me. On the plus side...it is a great album!"
4,"New to UFO, but old to Iron Maiden","I'm a sheltered music lover who had no idea about UFO. Of course I've heard Lights Out, but had no idea who UFO actually was. On the recommendation of a couple ""band friends"" I picked up some of their albums. Being a huge Maiden fan, they said I would dig UFO. Although no other band is Maiden, UFO is rock and roll at it's best. No neeed to listen to these new rock and roll bands, because they just wear make up, nail polish, and high fashion clothes, then put out bummer music.Also seeing the influence from bass player Pete Best to Steve Harris was really amazing. It made me realize that influences are very important, but creating your own style is equally important.Now when I go to Maiden concerts and they prime the crowd with ""Doctor, Doctor"" I'll know who the hell the band is."
5,Buy this now!,"Oh yeah! We have been waiting for this one. What a killer CD. Buy this now, because you really can't wait, can you? It has all the songs you know, plus the extra tracks. Get it now! 2008 remaster, oh yeah! Schenker rules! Plus, it was remastered at Abbey Road, come on!"
5,"ufo,s finest studio album lights out remastered finally!!","i still love this album 32 years after it,s release in 1977.the lights out line up was the best they ever had no disrespect to paul chapman,i liked the chapman era albums no place to run,wild willing and the innocent,..and some of mechanix.lights out is an enjoyable diverse collection of songs.my favorites are too hot to handle,electric phase,lights out,gettin ready and love to love!this line up of ufo created 2 more great albums,obsession and the excellent live strangers in the night!!i wish this line up had continued longer than it did.this album is a must for michael schenker fans and ufo fans!!!"
5,Just listen to Michael Schenker,"Just listen to Michael Schenker's guitar playing, Forget all the rest (which is very good, also). It's all you need to hear. Amazing."
5,Works as advertised,"The keypad sold for a reasonable price, arrived quickly, was complete (including battery), and was easy to program and install. The instructions that came with it were clear and easy to follow. It continues to work over the last month. Can't ask for more than that."
4,Works OK,"It took a while to make it work during setup for two doors. Had to ""trick"" it to get it working. Now that it is functioning, I have had no problems"
5,Easy to install and use.,Genie GWKP-BL New Wireless Keypad with IntellicodeThis unit was very easy to install and program. It offers a secure way to open your garage door when you don't have a key or remote with you.
5,"Easy installation, works great!",Programmed and installed in less than 10 minutes. Works great! I like the fact that the keypad is backlit for use at night.
2,Not very durable,"The unit installs and works well, but it doesn't seem to be very durable. The front cover easily becomes disconnected at the hinge during normal operation. The unit worked well for about a year, but it now completely fails to operate the door."
1,Works but CHEAPLY MADE,Received this keypad with my Genie Excelerator garage door opener purchased from Home Depot. Keypad works well but plastic cover is so poorly designed it come off everytime you open it - very frustrating that something so small could be overlooked by Genie. Plastic tabs are desinged so poorly it makes you wonder if Genie put a similar lack of integrity into the opener itself.
3,decent opener,"I bought this opener to replace the first one in which the buttons would always stick and my parents (who are on the older side) could never seem to open. This one works well with my Genie Intellicode garade. However, the cover hinge broke within a month. And after two years it has stopped working entirely (won't reset/reprogram and won't open the garage). So better than some but I still wonder if there's something else out there that is more durable."
4,Why did I wait so long to get this?,"After years of making sure we had a small remote with us when going bike riding or a walk, we saw this on amazon (it was recommended as we were shopping for another replacement remote!) and thought...""Why haven't I tried this before?"" I love this unit. It was a little tricky to program, but it might be one of the best things I've bought in a long time. My kids can come and go without keys (they would lose them), and I no longer have to carry remotes when I ride. Get one! It only loses a star due to some goofy behavior during programming that made it take longer than needed."
3,"Convenient, but not durable","I love the convenience of having this, but the front cover snapped off after only a month of rare use."
3,wireless remote,"remote didn't seem to initially work with my 1995 garage door opener. I did a lot of research to see what would be compatible with an older genie model. When I called the supplier for help, they could not provide any assistance on what keypad to purchase instead but they did refer me to the Genie 1-800 number and they were able to provide assistance - finally, the keypad did work."
4,Great. Very convenient,"Got this as an additional garage door opener when I was looking for a replacement garage door remote. It actually came in handy when selling the house for having the Habitat Restore guys come and pick up some appliances I was donating. I set up a temporary code for them to use that I was able to change back to the original code afterwards. Such a great option! Only problem is the Habitat guys had trouble getting the door closed back again. Don't know what happened. Seems to work fine, but there was that one small glitch. A very nice convenient gadget to have. I wish I had gotten it earlier."
2,Not reccomended,Not worth the trouble. I bought 3. I found that the hose almost never kinks at the end anyway but the adapter has a problem that make it a pain to use. Because the spring is slippery when wet and rotates on the adapter it is nearly impossible to tighten the connection so it can leak. I had to slide the spring back from the end and hold it while getting a pliers on the end fitting to tighten it. Damage is a possibility. One place that it is useful is where you wish to have an item attached to a spigot and still manipulate it somewhat. In my case this is a filter unit for a watering unit that I can get to more easily if I can bend the connection a bit.
4,Good information for older OMC Sterndrives.,"This repair manual has been a lot of help with my restoration/rebuild of an 1987 boat with an OMC sterndrive engine. Good information on routine maintenance, tune-ups and winterizing your boat also."
2,Would have given a 5 if not for all the sex!,"I enjoyed the book. But I do have to say that the sex was too descriptive. It was not necessary to make it into soft porn. I finally figured out when it was going to happen and then had to skip over several pages at times just to get past it. For that reason alone I give the book a 2. I can't even recommend it due to all the sex, sorry!! It was a great story though!"
1,Disappointed!!!,Tatiana and Alexander - Paullina Simons - The product description of this item was a 1st/2nd edition (2003?) which we were particularly after as it includes an epilogue not found in later editions. When the book was delivered we found it was a 2008 edition which was not what we had ordered. Disappointed that amazon did not deliver the expected edition but substituted for a later edition of the book.
4,Great book,I loved bronze horseman more than anything. This book was excellent. There was a lot more details of the war in this book.
4,Tatiana and Alexander is an epic love story,"Tatiana and Alexander was difficult for me to get used to reading and first -- there is so much internal dialogue between characters that sometimes you forget who is talking. Once you get over this, the story line is engaging and heartbreaking. Sometimes I wanted to scream at the characters in this book -- at Tatiana who was too afraid to let her sister know about her true love and at Alexander who pretended for so long to Tatiana's face not to love her just to appease her sister. When Tatiana and Alexander could be together, the heat and passion were palpable and you yourself wish for such love in your own life. Mixed with love and passion was the struggle all of the characters went through in the harsh and unforgiving Leningrad; there was no hiding the sometimes inhumane conditions and actions that went on in that desperate city. Overall this is a great love story mixed with war, struggle and survival."
3,"Enjoying , but find repetitions","I love Tatiana and Alexander. There is alot of repetition from the first book.I find myself skipping sections In this book, as I already read it in the first book. I do enjoy reading about their love story going forward."
5,Great!,"Another great book by Paulinna Simons! She never disappoints. If you have read others, read this one!"
2,Disappointed,"This is the 2nd book of 3. I found it difficult to get through primarily because it was boring. Lots of repetition of what was in the first book ""The Bronze Horseman"" which I loved and couldn't put down. I did a lot of skimming thru ""Tatiana & Alexander""."
4,,"This is the love story of Tatiana, young Russian girl, and Alexander, son of Americans who came to the Soviet Union in the 1930's. The story is split between Tatiana, who manages to escape to the US while pregnant, and Alexander, from the time he came to the Soviet Union throughout WWII. Simons is a talented author and great storyteller, who is comfortable touching on touchy subjects such as soviet politics, the treatment of prisoners, etc., which gives a lot of credibility to the story. The Soviet Union and WWII are more than a background to this story and I learnt a lot through the experiences of Alexander and how he managed before and during the war as an American at heart. To me this wasn't the best book by Paullina Simons (the best being The Girl in Times Square), but I enjoyed it a lot and it will touch a lot of readers."
3,Just Sad,I felt like the book dragged on for about 400 pages. it was just about how sad tatiana and alexander were during their separation. Tatiana was not my favorite character in this book at all. I thought she was being a bit selfish with her emotions especially since she had a son that needed her. The first book The bronze Horseman was much much better.
4,Good Reading,"This is the 2nd book in the series, was as capivating has the first book. Really enjoyed reading it and gave it to a friend to read, and she loved it has much as I did. Read all 3 novels."
5,I couldn't put the book down,"The author incorporates a love story, history and family emotions to keep you engaged. She is descriptive and grows her characters throughout the story."
4,Not as good as the first book,"I don't think this book is as good as the first book (The Bronze Horseman,)but it's not bad. I just had to read this to know what happened since I loved the first book."
5,TATIANA AND ALEXANDER,GREAT BOOK LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK TATIANA WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL YOUNG WOMAN OR ACTUALLY SHE WAS JUST A GIRL
2,Ugh.,Loved the first book so much I couldn't wait to get the second one which my library didn't carry. Ugh. Have read about 60 pages and cannot pick it back up. Tired of it and find it very annoying now.
4,One of the best Wallace biographies,"Peter Reese's book is highly recommended because:a) It is divided into logical sections.b) It covers both the life of Wallace and the aftermath right up to the date of publication (1996).c) It is very strong on the military aspects of Wallace's life and campaigns.d) It sets Wallace's life into the context of Scotland at that time.e) It is very well written, avoids going into unnecessary detail, and makes the important points.The epilogue is slightly out of date now as a lot has happened in Scotland since 1996 i.e. the devolution referendum in 1997 and the establishment of the new Scottish Parliament in 1999.In summary, one of the best Wallace biographies - we recommend it very strongly. [MacBraveHeart May, 1999]"
4,Work ok,"The premium version will outlast this one. It is probably good for someone who uses it a bit less though. In all fairness I have to change the blade 4 times a day at work 6 days a week, so it is not a surprise they break. Good general purpose utility knife, buy the premium if you're rough on them though."
1,Small Town? Small premise!,"Let me start by saying that I own everything that Lawrence Block has published. That out of the way, let me say this: What did he think was pulling this story together? There is no compelling theme, no protagonist, no cogency as he flits from one character to another without any particular purpose. The sex is a poor substitute for plot mechanisms. Was he writing in the hopes of selling the book for conversion to a soft core movie producer? Was he in a rush to bring out the defining post 9/11 NYC novel? Whatever the motivation, the finished product just does not reflect the level of expertise and craftsmanship that Block has demonstrated in other efforts. What a disappointment."
2,Is this really Lawrence Block?,"This book left me wondering who wrote it. It's not the same style I remember from years past. My biggest complaint is TOO MUCH SEX. I recall Block as writing fast moving light mysteries. Maybe I'm wrong, I currently don't have any of his books to compare. Would I buy it had I known? Yes. I still would go for his name on the cover."
3,Disappointment,"This book is far too long and detailed for the plot. One must wade through pages and pages to get to the essence of the story. This is not like the usual Lawrence Block writings. Disapponted in this one, but looking forward to his next book."
2,Avid Block Reader Sorely Disappointed,"I've read all of LB's books to date. I have absolutely enjoyed his Scudder books and short stories in some mystery anthologies. I was hoping for another great LB book.I kept on putting this one down feeling that it was discombobulated and somehow incomplete. After more than 100 pages I stopped reading the book. I was frustrated with some characters who just didn't seem real and what did another reviewer say...something about this book being ""over the top"" at times. How true.I didn't like the flow of the book and the various sub-plots. Not only did I think it was slow moving, but I felt that he wasn't writing some of the women characters well."
2,Major disappointment!,"I know that one should not take a serious writer's style for granted (and Lawrence Block is certainly a serious writer), but I have always looked to Mr. Block for something other than what was offered in his latest work. Since the publishing world seemed to think it was a book worth reading, I guess I am just too provincial to appreciate all the gratuitous, kinky sex in ""A Small Town"". From now on, I think I will check out Mr. Block's books from my library...at least, when I put it down, unfinished, I do not have to regret wasting both my money and my time."
3,Block Wishes He Went to an English Boarding School,"This is a good story marred by lots over over the top sexual fetishes. They all revolved around apparently manly men finding out they like something that might be the featured attraction at one of the more specialized Pat Pong bars. But the story and the characters are well done (no pun intended)aside from the above detour(no pun intended). I find that as time goes on I am drawn to books written right after 9/11 when the attack colored our preceptions of everything. I havn't forgotten 9/11 and like books that take me back to the time when we were digging out and preparing to go on the offensive. I just wish our senior leaders both civilan and military, and representing both parties, had shown the determination and fortitude of the armed forces and common citizens after 9/11."
2,How many subplots do you need?,"I'm not fond of books where you know the 'killer' within the first few pages. This book is most disappointing in that there are too many players in a game that isn't that good to begin with. I haven't read anything else by Block, and probably won't."
2,"Starts with a Bang, Ends with a Whimper","This book started out in a fascinating way - a janitor discovers a body, a writer is possibly guilty (but doesn't remember the crime), etc., but then goes downhill fast. Once the murderer is revealed, it becomes dull, since we know the ending. Plus, the kinky sex scenes with the art dealer are embarrassing, juvenile, and actually got boring after awhile, since they seemed to have nothing to do with the book. I would not recommend this book."
3,"Good, not great","1. A lot of graphic sex scenes that just got boring after a while, I didn't mind, but without pictures, they didn't really add anything to the story.2. ... driving home the point that New York is a ""Small Town""...I lived there 20 years and I say ""no WAY!""3. Nicely paced, good climax.4. Some plot threads are not resolved which is too bad because the characterizations were terrific."
3,Post 9-11 New York,"A character study of several city dwellers by a master author. Well drawn, but not really satisfying."
4,It's a compelling read,"This book was my introduction to Larry Block and a fine one at that. More than a mystery this book is a real novel! That said, I do think that there are moments when Block is a little bit over the top. In particular with the character of Susan. The long psudo-porn scenes with her brutal to read and add little to the plot. Maybe her sexual obsession is her way of coping in a post 9/11 world, but I didnt buy it personally. I thought everthing involving her was a tad indulgant on Blocks part.That aside though there are pleasure's aplenty here for the decerning reader and I would recomend this book."
4,Post 9/11 fiction from New York Mystery Man,"Small Town is not a Scudder, a Rodenbarr, a Tanner, or a Keller. It's a standalone mystery novel, but Block fans will certainly recognize the milieu. It's a thick book, but a quick read, with many of Block's trademark themes including recovery and quirky sexuality. Block fans won't be disappointed."
2,thineagle,"I'm a real Block fan, but where this book was concerned, I just wanted it to end. Where is the Block who gave me those concise Matt Scudder books where I was hooked for hours on end until the end? Instead, I'm subjected to ""New York"" where everything is sex, sex, sex-- excuse me, where is Lawrence Block, the novelist, not the porn expert? Please, Lawrence, don't get senile on us-- get back to Matthew and his problems and those neat mysteries we can cozy up to with a hot toddy and our recliner and lose ourselves in your great prose. Please..."
3,Still shaking my head,"I read this book start to finish and kept waiting for the sex scenes to matter. Please,if this is the first Lawrence Block book for you, PLEASE put it back and start with the Matthew Scudder series, from the first to the last, then go on to the other series, and ONLY when you are a diehard Lawrence Block fan, as am I, consider trying this book. I must agree with the reviewer who said Block waited for his mother to die to write these icky and irrelevent sex scenes. I am not a goody-goody, I just didn't see the point (so to speak). Reading this book before you are a Block lover could cause you to miss some excellent, compelling writing by a true NYC lover."
2,OVER THE TOP SEX AND LOOSE ENDS GALORE,"Despite all the favorable reviews I read in this space, I thought this was an awful book. Major plot lines were left hanging. Heroine has outrageous sex with many people in bizarre and embarrassing ways, ends up loving the protagonist -- who still may be a murderer. Everybody ends up happy when they shouldn't, when in reality they wouldn't. The 9/11 stuff is so unreal. There is no motivation here that makes sense. This is the kind of stuff that Harold Robbins was famous for, but at least he tried to tie things together; Block doesn't even make the effort. If this is the kind of stuff you guys are reading and enjoying, you need tomove up in the world and try other authors of some quality."
4,"Compelling Characters, A Plot Too Far","I felt the strength of this story was the characters. They are riveting and fully rounded. The plot seemed a bit contrived, in that the 'villain' was described but his motivations weren't exactly coherent.However, Block is clearly in love with Manhattan, and his passion is communicated in this book like all his others."
1,Really not very good,"Well, I've read Scudder, Bernie, and the other Block main characters, so I know Block. This book starts off well, with a very interesting plot. It even has an interesting and surprisingly sympathetic, murderer.But the over-the-top sex scenes were just plain boring after a while. By the end, I didn't really care much for Susan. And are we really to believe a macho former police commissioner would let himself be so utterly dominated by a woman? And are we really to believe that this same woman ""teaches"" another man he's gay? Please.Finally, the ending is just too little, too late. By the time the Carpenter meets his maker, I'd just about had it with the book.In short, this book was too long, and the heavy emphasis on sex made the story, and the characters, LESS interesting than more."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I picked up the unabridged 13 disc audio version of this novel at my local library. I can't recommend it.While the ""killer on the loose"" part was fairly interesting, the sex scenes seemed to be just added to lengthen the book. I'm not a prude, but practically all of the sex scenes could have been removed and this would have been a much more interesting ""thriller"".The book was long and at times just plain boring.In fact, disc 6 was defective and wouldn't play, so I skipped it entirely, only to find that I could still easily understand the rest of the novel.I wanted to see what was going to happen to the ""killer"", but every time the story turned to a ""love scene"" it was more of a turn off than it was a turn on.The book could have been MUCH shorter. That alone would have improved it. I doubt I'll be reading/listening to any other novels written by this author.Save your time and enjoy something else instead."
1,Very Disappointing,"Block says that this is his first book that his mom did not get to read. Whew, I wouldn't want my mom to read this either. To me, sex in a story is like salt in a soup. Every life, every soup needs a dash but in this case when there is scene after masochistic scene of sex torture it's just nauseating. I couldn't even finish this book, the characters were so dull that I didnt even care what happened to them. Up until now I bought Block's books in hardcover. Now I will peruse them in the store before making the mistake of buying them."
3,Very disappointing!,"Thankfully, when I decided to read a novel by Lawrence Block I started with the Mathew Scudder series because if I started with SMALL TOWN I wouldn't have read any others.I was very disappointed with this story, although I tried my best to keep reading with hopes I would change my mind, but I just couldn't finish it. It sounded like a great plot at first, but I got bored with the characters quickly. Since I enjoyed the Mathew Scudder series so much I haven't in any way given up reading his novels. I just wish this one had been better."
1,What a stinker!,"Hard to believe that an author with such strong credentials wrote this mess. Improbable plot, thoroughly unlikeable, flat characters, excessive boring, badly-described, kinky sex, implausible coincidences...presumably the reason for the book title... and a turgid drawn-out ending. I struggled to reach the end of the book. LB, please go back to your previous formulae."
5,Great book,"I bought this book as a present for the huge James Bond fan in my life and it was perfect. He really enjoyed looking at all of the classic posters from the various movies. If you have someone who really is a Bond fanatic, this is the way to go!"
4,Bond the Icon,"The only reason I am not rating this book 5 stars is that the selection of posters from my favorite Bond film, 'You Only Live Twice', was limp. That said, the book exceeded my expectations for showing 'the images of the fantasy' of Bond: the debonnaire sexual animal, the wry expression on his face, the ever present gun, boobs, booze, and world saving mission....A wonderful surprise was all the foreign posters, which really added a dimension of how other cultures have interpreted Bond. The book is wonderful more for its great collection of Bond posters than for any high art book production quality (although the reproductions are fine).Bond was my idol as a boy. This caused some problems in later life, given his unending cycle of kill a guy, save the world, screw a woman, have a drink. So I have definite mixed feelings about the character, but marvel at the whole dramatic creation of it all......"
4,A real bargain for Blus lovers!,"I buy a lot of ""samplers"" looking for songs or artists that I haven't heard before. I bought this one a while back because it was just too cheap to pass up and what a surprise! There's a great mix of blues styles and proven performers, and the music mix and sound quality were much better than I expected.This is a great bargain!"
4,A Good Friend to Oily Skin,"I've been using Pond's Clear Solutions deep pore foaming facial cleanser for about two years now and am extremely pleased with the product. I discovered it on my own through trial and error while searching for a cleanser to combat my oily skin. This cleanser does a fine job of not only effectively eleminating the excess oil but it also doesn't leave my face dry and tight like other oil control and oil free cleansers I've tried. Packed full of botanicals like Rosemary and Green Tea, the product smells great; and with attractive transparent colbalt blue packaging, I don't mind leaving it out on the bathroom counter either. To those who wear cosmetics, I would advise perhaps removing makeup with toweletts before washing with this product. A splash of peroxide mixed with the cleanser on a washcloth also works well at removing makeup."
3,a little too gentle for me,"Maybe my skin is too oily but my face just doesn't feel clean after I use this cleanser. Sure, the foam is gentle and it doesn't irritate my skin at all or leave it red, and it has a nice herbal smell. But it seems to leave some amount of residue on my face after rinsing it off. Maybe I just need to follow it up with astringent or toner, but on its own I don't think this product worked for me."
5,A Great Read - America as it should be,The author is not holding back. He gives the reasons why America has fallen from the a once great free society with individual responsibility to a society of dependence on government. Also Joseph Farah give clear steps that can be taken to reclaim America. He shows how our current elected officials completely ignor our Constitution and Bill of Rights for their selfish political ambition.
1,I Expected More,"When I bought this book, I couldn't wait for it to arrive at my home. I had heard such wonderful things about this book!When I began to read the book I was left disappointed. I began to wonder how we will ever take back America. It has been so long since we had America. Now I plan to re-read to see if I missed something. Maybe then we will be able to take back America. This is my dream. I come to this country as immigrant. But we must work hard if we are to take back America. It is hard to take back America but I think we can."
4,An Engaging Entry Into Edward II & Isabella's World,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written, logically formatted book. Unlike many non-fiction works covering this period in history, the auther manages to provide a great many pertinent facts without confusing the reader. Mr. Dougherty's hypothesis is that perhaps Edward II was not killed and may well have escaped his imprisonment and lived out the rest of his life abroad in exile. Could it be that the body contained in a tomb in Gloucester Cathedral does not belong to King Edward II? The arguments in this regard are convincing, reasonable and thus, most interesting to ponder. The absence of photographs was a slight disappointment but they are not integral to the understanding of this very good book."
2,Dull,"With such interesting subject matter, I had high hopes for this book. However, it is so sluggish I can hardly get through it. The language and writing style is faux-scholarly and circuitous. As a result, the story doesn't ""flow"" and I find myself forced to reread several parts. The author glazes over the juiciest bits as well. There must be a better telling of this story somewhere out there!"
5,The New Carly Simon,"I really enjoy these ""American Songbook"" type of albums, it lets us see an artist in a new light. Carly Simon takes a look back to music that has yet to be discovered by many folks these days and she does a magnificent job. Buy it you'll love it."
2,ERASE ONE SONG?,"I cringe each time I hear ""I've ga chew under my skin"". Otherwise, it's a pretty good album."
3,Limited Vocal Range,"Having been in high-end audio for over fifty years I can say that the quality of this non-live disc is O.K. However, due to Ms Simon's limited vocal range, she should have left a number of the selections out. The best song on the CD is Cole Porter's In THe Still Of The Night. Ms. Sinon's version is O.K. but there is NO comparsion with ELLA; she has the full range which Ms. Simon lacks.RC Napper-KC & Scottsdale"
2,Simply Put -- I didn't like it.,"She wouldn't have made it past the first cut of American Idol singing like this (Pitchy). She choose a beautiful selection of songs, and the band behind her sounded great (that's why I gave 2 stars instead of one), but these songs are just not for her. These beautiful ballads highlight the fact that she has NO vocal range whatsoever. She goes badly off key in numerous places, I winced a couple of times -- I guess they can only work so much magic technically.I am a fan going back to the 70's and continue to be a fan of her original work -- she needs to stick to what she does best."
3,So What?,Isn't there a decent-sized label that will give this lady a chance to do what she does best...which is to perform her ownsongs? Guess not.
1,like Carly but hate this CD,"I like Carly Simon and most of her singing, but her voice is way to masculine for these type of songs."
5,WHEN WILL AMAZON MAKE 10 STARS? THIS ALBUM DESERVES MORE THAN 10!!,"I stumbled upon Carly's new album today during my lunch break forgetting it was out yesterday. I decided to sample to see what new take she's done on these classic standards. My mouth dropped open! What a gorgeous album, and this was just from the 30 second samples! It is also my first DualDisc, so I am excited about the DVD side, but have to wait until I get home to see what it is all about.This is an album that I am sure every ballroom dance couple, studio, etc, will be getting and wearing out! It makes you want to grab your partner and float on air. I don't think Carly has ever sounded better. Her version of ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" has now become my favorite, as it has been the Art Garfunkel cover for years that was my previous. Her beautiful alto fits so well with these classic standards, and the arrangements are top notch all the way. Definitely Grammy material for Best Tradition Pop Vocal."
2,What's happened to Carly?,"I bought this without even glancing at the reviews. I mean how could I ever go wrong with Carly Simon, right? She's been a top favorite of mine since the 70s. She has some of the greatest hit songs I've ever known. And her albums are wonderful! I have every one of them as a matter of fact. I say all of this to let you know, if you bothered reading this, that I am not trying to put her down in any way. I LOVE Carly Simon!! BUT, what's happened to her? She sounds flat on a number of these cuts, and sounds lackluster on most of the others. To all those folks who gave this cd five stars, have you really listened to it?? My gosh! It's pretty bad. I don't want to keep it. I've listened to it several times and can't get over the sad feeling it gives me. Hopefully this was just a fluke. Maybe she'll bounce back with something hot and sultry, like the old ones, that'll knock our socks off. I really, really hope so."
1,Bottom Of The Barrel,"All it takes is one listen to the Amazon.com soundclips of thisCD to hear that Carly is not in fighting shape here. (Sadly, Iactually plunked down the money to buy it without hearing any ofit first.) She sounds listless and almost as if she's strugglingwith the songs; and speaking of the songs, most are so overdoneit becomes tedious. How many more versions of ""I Only Have EyesFor You"" do we need? Spare me! The arrangements are also run-of-the-mill, almost Lawrence Welk-y in their blandness. I havealways loved Carly, but this appears to have been a bad idea fromthe start. Give a listen to ""Torch"" from 1981 if you want tohear how great she could sound singing classic material. NIX!"
5,Absolutely the best!,"Whenever I look for this CD, I can't find it, which is a crying shame. It's a WONDERFUL CD.Many of Willie's other CDs are ""overproduced"". They sound too silky smooth.This sounds more like Willie out on the back porch. I don't mean that in a bad way. It's very well done, very clear and beautiful. But it sounds like Willie and his guitar, not Willie, his guitar, a synthesizer, and a mixing board.A MUST have for fans of ANY type music!"
2,Maybe ok for a camera but useless for my spotting scope,"I had hoped to keep my birding scope at the ready on the deck table but for me this is totally inadequate.Note that it uses the window clamp to attach the scope to the tripod but the tiny clamp doesn't have the strength to grip the tripod tab and the knob slips on the screw if you try to make it sufficiently tight. It might be ok for a small camera, but telescopes need a wider base of support with no play in the moving parts; otherwise your image jumps all about. Do you realize the shortest leg is only 4 inches? Unfortunately-for my use-I made a mistake of buying a toy for a serious need."
3,so-so,"This tri-pod is ok. Not great and not bad. If you use a semi-heavy camera on it, it's hard to balance your camera/camcorder on it."
4,"Nice, simple.",You can't beat this for the price but I prefer my manfrotto mini 3007 kit for its flexibility
4,only one complaint,"the only thing i dont like about it is where the top connects to the bottom, the part that would be the window attaching piece to the actual tripod, it gets a little loose if you dont just tighten the crap out of it. and the tilt doesnt allow for the scope to be perfectly level its canted just a hair to one side. other than that its a great tripod"
4,Bushnell Tripod Window Mount,"I have taken thousands of pics out the window of car, bus, van, etc. I finally decided to automate it somewhat. I plan to use this device for a lightweight Sony H2 camera in Europe. I suspect that it will travel well. It is lightweight and appears to have a good attachment. The tripod is lightweight as well, but I suspect that it will be adequate for a lightweight camera. I have not had a chance to put it to the test yet, but hope that it will perform as anticipated."
3,Standard Punisher fare,"A one -off Punisher comic, done during the time when graphic novella formats were de rigeur. Larger page size and counts than your regular monthly, it's a fairly acceptable story of what would happen if the Punisher teams up with the Yakuza. Not much development on characters."
2,ANP Review,"This was the most frustrating review book I've ever used. The information appears to be concise, organized and complete, but the review questions and answers leave a lot to be desired. In one section, 10 questions were left unanswered. In several others, answers were there, but didn't match the questions (in numerical order). Many times the answer was written correctly but aligned with the wrong letter. The CD ROM was good, but several answers did not jive with information given in the book. All in all, this could have been a great review book if ANYone had bothered to proof read it before going to print. Very dissapointed, and I'd like a refund."
3,Fine for reviewing areas of weakness,"I concur with the previous reviewer that the publishers should have been more careful to verify that the Q&A's were accurate and matched with one another. The content of the book is overall very thorough...FAR more so than needed for taking the exam (the AANP version which I passed today!). If you have this book, DO NOT go through it cover to cover as your main source of review, but, use it as an adjunct for areas of weakness. The CDRom was disappointing as each subject area had less than 15 questions. I strongly recommend taking a review course to focus more on general principles. Good luck to all!"
4,KONTORT YOURSELF in the 21st. century,"James White was the catalyst to the post-punkfunk new york no-wave. His 12"" disco version of contort yourself is a hypertrophic masterpiece that i play whenver i deejay regardless of how many people are confused by its conceptual late miles lounge lizard discombobulated cryptic freestyle jazz noise.The 12"" though has a great disco beat. But the non-disco version is fabulous. Messy, exotic, punky, with attitude and whimsy. I saw the contortions play live in 1976. Pure f**ked up dazz.Extended and alternate versions of the original vinyl are all inlcuded here which makes this record a must. It was not available on cd for the longest time and the vinyl is rare. Ideally I recommend the newly released box set of all his albums."
4,A pleasant blast from the past,"I still have the original album, but worn because I played it endlessly as a youth. I have tried to buy the CD version, but was never in stock. The mp3 is welcomed. The best way to listen is to close your eyes, turn up the volume, and let your imagination go with the dialogue. For today's youth, they may not appreciate this as much as adults who once heard or owned it when young. But for adults who like the monsters as children, this trip down nostalgia is a fun ride."
4,NOTHING BEATS SHORT SINGING PORTER,"Bobby Short has to be the leading Cole Porter interpreter today. It's hard not to think of Short and not picture him singing Porter. As for Cole Porter he is simplely the GREATEST composer that ever lived. In my opinion. I never heard Short sing some of the songs on this album and was wondering when he would record them. For instance ""What Is This Thing Called Love"" which is a or should I say WAS a very popular song. There's something extra here in this album,Short now works with a orchestra. Also he has Howard Alden playing his great guitar. I happened to hear Alden in the movie ""Sweet and Lowdown"". Short once again makes a great album. If your a fan of Cole Porter's music or Bobby Short...YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!"
2,Save your money and look elsewhere,This book is mainly a flowery description of bicycle components using enough technical jargon to make it incomprehensible to all but professional bicycle mechanics (who probably don't need this book anyway). There are very few pictures of the components described and no easy to follow repair instructions that a novice like myself could use.
3,It lives up to its title. But needs an editor.,"""Bicycle!"" is truly a manifesto. It's more a declaration of independence than a how-to manual. What is lacking in instructions is made up for in practical advice and knowledge. Tracy says the things you wish a bike mechanic or salesman would tell you when you're at the shop (but of course won't because they want to bilk you out of your money) in regards to what repairs to make, how to make them, and what tools one should purchase. The prose is sometimes too flowery, verbose and rambling and the full page photographs of people riding their bikes around various parts of the world seem like a misuse of page space when illustrations of maintenance are sorely lacking. Tracy needed an editor before this hit the press. It's a good read, but don't buy it. Get it at the library or thumb through it at the bookstore."
1,Did not work,"After I opened the cartridge, removed the protective tape and placed it into my printer, my printer put up an error message saying that I needed to remove and inspect the cartridge. It would not work in my hp officejet 4215 all in one, even though it looked like it should."
5,I couldn't believe,"I recently bought Old Man Motel because i read about the CD in the September issue of Discoveries. The article was right this CD is by far the best record of the year.The Track Could'nt Believe is a brilliant anthem for our generation.other Standout tracks are Ride,Jesus,Swing Low,Rain'n Outside and the haunting In the End."
4,Certainly not your traditional pop album,"This album has got some depth to it, that's for certain. At first I wasn't certain if I was listening to a joke or the musical version of Jack T. Chick. Ultimately I realized it was a joke and a fine one, at that. The lyrical content of some songs doesn't pull punches; ""United Nations"" sounds like a far-right militia theme song, and the more humorless out there will NOT find it funny.But there's some pretty interesting stuff. I'm not a fan of experimentalism in general, but Conn smartly refrains from doing nothing but ""experimenting"", sparing us a torturous album. He blasts the Heaven's Gate cultists (""California""), wannabe stars (""Baby Man""), rich-kid jerks (""White Bread""), and the more extreme edges of the right (the aforementioned ""United Nations."") This is a good, fun, genre-jumping album and one I fully recommend."
1,Played with ONCE,"My 4 year old wanted this and played with it when she first brought it home, hasn't played it since. It's too easy for her. My 3 yr old didn't have the attention span to play since the audio was kind of slow. Often times I couldn't get the shell to 'talk' in my ear."
1,Skip this one,"As a long time fan of Cranium, this is a major disappointment. As the other reviewers have written, it is boring, frustrating, and doesn't work all the time. It was a complete waste of money. Skip this game altogether."
1,I expeected better from Cranium,"I bought this game for my 3 and 4 year olds. They love Cariboo and Hulabaloo, so I figured a Cranium game couldn't miss. Well, I was certainly wrong! The game is boring once you've played it a few times. Once you can tell that the sound is, for example, a dolphin, you really don't need to stick the key in the shell to tell you that. But if you don't, the game doesn't work. And, of course, if you jostle the shell wrong, it messes up the whole game. Luckily I got this on a really good sale because it's now occupying space in the back of our game closet. Cramium should have known better!"
1,Taints Reputable Cranium Brand Name ...,"Cranium Sounds of the SeashoreNot sure why this product made it past Cranium Marketing. My kids were so confused with the instructions! Plus, the plastic seashell does not properly fit on its plastic base and it failed to work when turned on. We could not tell the difference between a sea sound and the on sound. The instructions did not provide much guidance to that, and most importantly, how to play the game.To play a good memory game with preschoolers, I recommend using an old-fashioned deck of cards or buying the old-school Original Memory Game by Hasbro:Original Memory"
1,Designed for boredom and frustration,"For a Cranium product I was pretty disappointed with this. The ""beginner"" level could easily be played by a toddler (18 months) and the advanced level is not much more challenging. I echo the frustration others had with the shell restarting a new sound every time it was lifted or jostled. The conch shell was telling us hooray! we were finished, when we still had about 6 shells on the board. At least dealing with that issue added a challenge to this otherwise completely boring game. If you think hearing a boat sound and then flipping over pictures until you find one of a boat sounds fun, then this is the game for you, otherwise I recommend parents of preschoolers get Cranium Cariboo instead."
2,Poor fixtures,"After just four months, the handles started cracking. We didn't notice it right away and my daughter cut her finger. Didn't need stitches but it was a deep and long cut. I then inspected the other handles and see that one other one had a visible crack and you can feel the edge raising a bit. Unlike most of the other handles in the faucets at my house, these don't look like they screw on. I'll have to shut off the water and pull the fixture out. I tried finding the company online, and they have been sold recently and all I can find is an address and phone number. I'll call them, but from other reviews I've found on the Web it seems likely I'll be on the phone a long time. I don't know that it is worth it. Better to just write it off and never buy from the company again."
4,We like it!,"My daughter, 3, really loves these games and can now play them by herself from start to finish. It's all very intuitive, so she can easily move from activity to activity. I DON'T like the ""adventure"" portions of these games -- as someone else wrote, they're WAAAAY too much ""video"" and not enough interaction. But the ""map"" portions, where you can click on each activity individually, are great."
2,WARNING: NOT COMPLETELY MAC COMPATIBLE,"I wish that I had read the reviews before ordering this, but I relied on Amazon's product description. One of the three games is NOT Mac compatible, despite NO WARNING WHATSOEVER of this fact on he product description or on the packaging. Dora Animal Adventures will only work on WinPCs."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This is just a waste of your money. The games are very cheesy and glorified version of what you see on TV/videos. No educational content...interaction between the software and the child is minimal...I bought Reader Rabbit PreSchool and Alphabet Express along with the DORA 3-pack....these two are very educational as well as entertaining for my 4 year old.
1,"Stick With Your Day Job, Mr Parkins....","'Cause You're No Tom Clancy(And even he's getting a bit ridiculous)I'm not going to waste time and keystrokes noting the errors that other reviewers have already cited. Please read University Place, Baltimore MD, and Tooele UT.It's a sophomoric mess and should be consigned to the kindling bin - starting a fire is about all it's worth."
4,Right on the Money,"I read the other reviews of ""experts"" and ""critics"" slamming this book, claiming it's nonsense. But guess what...the book was right on the money! It acurately depicted the terrorist incident as well as the chemical and biological terrorism that we're seeing now. I noticed that these ""experts"" and ""critics"" have had nothing more to say since it really did happen as the author predicted. And let me tell you - I puckered up when I read the description of what happens to a person exposed to chemical agent."
1,Tom Clancy It's Not,"The idea could have made a geat book, but the author just couldn't pull it off. The book has way too many typos and grammatical errors. There was no character development. The plot jumps and never grabs your attention. The only reason I actually read the entire thing is that I work at the facility that is destroying the Utah Chemical Weapons stockpile and was curious. Otherwise, this one would have been abandoned after 20 pages. Don't waste your money. In addition, the book contains significant technical errors. There are no GB (sarin) mines; GB is odorless and colorless; it does not hang around in a mist."
4,A great beginning to a great series,"Grady Service is a dedicated by the book Conservation Officer that does not take his job lightly as was his father before him.His job brings him from one part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to another dealing with everything from dead cats to murder and when his beloved ""Tract"" seems to be in danger there is no stopping him, even leading him to rely on the help of someone that he had always considered an enemy.Found the characters believable and interesting. Look forward to reading all the others in the series."
3,UP reader,This was a good read. UP references and descriptions true to form. Characters believable. Will continue this series of Woods cop mysteries.
4,North Woods Solutions,"Definitely a page-turner. I had to pace myself so I wouldn't finish too quickly. As a former CO, as it should for any ""cop"", it spoke to me the way Heywood brings in the questionable situations, the hunches, the blind leads, the confusion, the wrong conclusions,the helpful informants and information, the miniscule bits of info that are easy to overlook, the ""aha"" moments that are involved in any investigation. It's also interesting how he brings locations and place names that had me scrambling to the map even though I knew it was all fiction."
1,Still haven't gotten my book.,I have not gotten my book yet and midterms and the first project have already passed.
3,"A challenge may be needed, but...","I agree with many of the points that Fallon makes in her book, however, I also agree with another reviewer in saying that Fallon's book should be taken as a STEP in the right direction, but not taken as the end-all to the debate on a healthy diet. As Fallon's beloved Dr. Price so vividly demonstrated, there is no ONE diet that is perfect for all humans. Some of the groups he studied relied heavily on raw milk as a part of their diets and other didn't use it at all, yet they were still quite robust. Finding the right personal diet for yourself and your family involves a combination of research on nutrition as well as investigating your own heritage and spiritual beliefs. For the most part, I love the work Fallon is doing to bring attention to food issues, but any time we start getting too dogmatic in our thinking it can close our minds to other potentially useful ideas. I would also recommend The Yoga of Eating by Charles Eisenstein"
3,Reclaim Your Health,"If you are fed up with being sick and wondering why, read this informative cookbook that teaches you where our society has gone wrong with it's fast-food eating habits,over-processed foods laden with chemical cocktails, and a USDA that is dictated to by huge agri-business, which by the way is about money, not quality,safe food!!!The author explains why eating like our ancestors will bring us back to our optimum health and vitality with good wholesome foods!! This is not a diet book...it is a whole 'new' way of eating for life and health that will effect your whole lifestyle!! I've never read a book that has so completely changed my life for the better as Nourishing Traditions has!!"
5,Must have cookbook,Everything you need to know for healthy cooking and preparing meals. I am very pleased with it and surprised at how many wonderful recipes are in this book!
5,Best Cookbook I Own,"Hands down the best cookbook I own. It has helped me tremendously to improve my health and to educate me on how to homestead and cook in a way that feels very authentic and connected to my ancestors. Honors wisdom of the women and men that came before, which in itself is healing... Thank you!"
5,Fantastic! Highly Recommend,"Everyone should read this book/cookbook, it is so much more it has loads of information."
1,Not based in reality,"While this book's ideas seem really great at first, almost none of this is based on fact or science. Basically, this book claims a lot, but when you actually look for studies, almost none of it is supported. The studies that they do use to support their work were single studies with problems that were not able to be reproduced. Don't waste your time with this crap. If you want a real book on nutrition that involved actual science, check out the China Study."
3,Ehh..It's just so-so.,"This cookbook is pretty much a vegetarian's nightmare. It is loaded with a lot of ""meaty"" recipes and not very many good veggie recipes. However, it does provide some overall good dietary info."
2,Only For The Amish,"Nourishing Traditions has a lot of very interesting information that may or may not be true, but let's get real, who has time to cook like this? Maybe if I were Amish! In addition to being expensive and taking forever to arrive, this cookbook was just too much work and hassle. It took all weekend to make about three recipes due to the author's lengthy soaking and fermentation times in her recipes. The stuff I tried wasn't that incredibly tasty and the banana bread made me feel ill( maybe it isn't a good idea to let the batter sit out overnight.) I made one big dinner from Fallon's recipes and felt tired , heavy and bloated. So I'm not sure eating indiscriminate amounts of animal fats is such a great idea, but if you want to spend every free moment cooking, be sure and buy this one!"
5,Great book!!,"I love this book, because it not only has a lot of good information of the best food to eat and the food we should avoid, also it has good recipes."
5,nt,awesome book! a very different look at nutrition and diet. I think that everyone in america should read this book.
4,Absolut must!,"If you want to know how to cook in a healthy way for your family then you need this book. It will transform the way you shop and eat and cook. So many insights about healthy and unhealthy fats and how important fats are, butter will be your new hero in your fridge and your ways you think about meat will most surely change! Everybody should read this book, but especially pregnant women and mothers!"
5,Absolutely a must,This is one of the best purchases I have ever made in my life. I am eating right now Kimchi I made using her recipe and it is by far the best I have ever had. Her fermented bean paste recipe is also great. Buy it and nourish yourself.
5,Exactly What I Expected,As a newbie to fermenting foods I was looking for a book that clearly explained the why's and how's of this traditional skill along with some easy recipes to try. This book does exactly that. It is easy to read and the recipes are inexpensive. I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in adding nutritious and tasty traditional foods to their menu.
5,Amazingly informative!,"This book is amazing. It was well thought-out, well researched, and well put-together. Fallon has amazing insights into what foods have kept people healthy for generations and how we can implement these preparations into our everyday eating habbits. I've been gradually eating a more healthy diet over several years, and this book will definitely lead into my next big step. This is not a twigs and berries diet, these are full, rich, flavorful, nourishing foods!"
3,kindle version could be easier to navigate,"The kindle version lacks an index and would benefit greatly from a finer grained table of contents or the addition of a detailed recipe list organized by categories. Also the content seems disjointed (abrupt changes in content) because items that were sidebars in the printed addition appear right inline with the main content in my kindle version. Still, great to have this book at my fingertips!"
2,Baking Recipes Are a Disaster,"Have the people who've written such rave reviews of this book actually attempted any of the baking recipes? My second attempt was as bad as the first, and according to one of the online forums I found, I'm not the only one who's had trouble. I like the ideas behind many of the book's suggestions but putting them into practice made for very flawed results. The Banana Bread overflowed the pan and over-browned on the top without ever cooking through. The Breakfast Pastries were so wet, even after adding more and more flour, that rolling them was a joke. Then they just dissolved into very flat cookies, but considering the recipe didn't call for any rising agent, what else could be expected? It's like whoever wrote these recipes never even tested them."
4,Science in your Kitchen,"This book by Sally Fallon has a lot of great information. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in high quality nutrition. Unfortunately, most of her recipes are extremely bland and fermented fruits and vegetables are pretty much inedible in this day and age. Unless she's prepared to come into your kitchen and prove that her foods can possibly taste satisfactory, be prepared for a wealth of information and some fun inedible science experiements."
1,Terrible book,"What a dreadful book. I bought this book at the beginning of last year and took on the books advice due to ill health. I have suffered even more illness because of it - my cholesterol levels have sky rocketed, I feel tired all the time and I can't sleep properly at night. I also suffered a stroke mid January. My doctor is terribly disappointed because I ignored her advice to eat less meat products and those yummy fatty foods. I was in fantasy land when I thought that this book would solve my health problems!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"One friend told me to get this book when I talked about going to raw foods. Another friend said she thought it would help her with intestinal yeast overgrowth. Both friends were wrong. For someone on the Standard American Diet (SAD), to follow the precepts in this book would certainly be an improvement. But for someone who already knows not to eat processed foods and wants to go vegan or raw vegan, or get rid of chronic yeast overgrowth, there are better books out there: For vegan wannabes or anyone who wants info on juicing, The Hallelujah Diet by George Malkmus has it all, the why, the what, the when and the how. If this diet doesn't also get your intestinal yeast overgrowth repaired, there's always The Body Ecology Diet by Donna Gates."
3,The binding split,I absolutly love the book. I alreday have 2. However the binding on the book split right down the middle the first time I opened it. Now what recourse do I have. Teresa
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"I love this cookbook. Favorite recipe so far is the fermented salsa on p. 103. I refer to this cookbook frequently and definitely use it more than any other, but it is also fun to just read it."
2,"Like the message, contents too much","I would have liked to know how detailed the book goes into using strictly organic foods. I wanted something more simple, and it's always better with pictures. The basic concepts and how they are written makes for good reading and education indeed. I love the cover, it is a great book to set out, but how many of those can I use. Unfortunately I regret buying this book because I will not use it. I have MS and was looking for simple good natural recipes. Sorry! the lady who recommended it to me, didn't really know what I wanted."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this after an co-worker lent it to me. The recipes are delicious and the chapters on nutrition enlightening. As I was reading I kept thinking ""Of course!"" I bought a copy for my chronically ill mother and just be improving her nutrition her health has improved. Though, I will say this book isn't for everyone, especially vegetarians. It's a good fit for me as I am able to get raw milk and butter. But for most people grass fed beef is impossible to come by. Still, I highly recommend it."
4,Learning new ways,I have already learned that there are many ingredients I knew nothing about. However I have tried the pancakes on my grandaughter. She ate them. I plan on trying more as soon as I can get to a health food store for more supplies.
5,"a major ""THANK YOU"" goes out to all our ancestors on this one","I love traditional foods and I know my great-grandmother would be proud to know that I have not let the ""western diet"" influence its way into my home. The desert section is so much fun to play with. Guilt free deserts??? Sign me up! I have a tub of the vanilla ice-cream in my freezer right now. It tastes like I flew it in fresh from Italy."
5,Fascinating reading -,This book was recommended to me and I ordered it online. I have passed it on to my daughter as my grandson is showing signs of serious food allergies - I believe we need to get back to basics from all of the processed foods we eat. This book is very informative.
5,nourishing traditions,"Really enjoying this book. I have changed my eating habits over the last five years dramatically to exclude processed foods and avoid anything containing chemicals or fillers (basically, if I can't pronounce the word of an ingredient, I avoid the product); nothing boxed, canned, or pre-packaged. This book has helped me understand why I am doing what I am doing. It's basic understanding of whole foods and our need for them is enlightening and easy to follow."
5,Wisdom,This really is an interesting book that explains so much about the way we live today and the way we should be living love it very much great reference to have on hand
1,Haven't Read...Too Alarmed!,"I'm really shocked at the black and white opinions of this book! I just can't bring myself to read it...I really believe that we are supposed to eat what is most abundant on this Earth, namely fruits and veggies and grains. I think that meats and milks and fats have their place. Also, all people are different. No two people do well eating the exact same thing! I do think this book should be updated and republished, then I might consider purchasing!"
2,ewwwwwwwwwwww,"Raw beef and liver recipes? Yuck.....that is what you will find in here. The ideas are definitely interesting, and some of it is dead on, and others I question. But, there are some good recipes in here, just steer clear of the raw meat and seafood and you should be good, lol......"
3,good book,"I would prefer more tabulated, visually pleasant version of this book, plus maybe some pictures, graphs, something to look at and remember, otherwise its a looot of reading especially for somebody with a little time; other than that - good book, and I believe good recipes - haven't tried yet"
1,"If you like brain, liver, heart ...this is a great cookbook :(","No normal meat is used in this book, i was expecting natural ingredients but not weird. Was very disappointed !!!"
4,Nourishing Traditions,"I really enjoyed the concepts in this book, however I don't agree with a lot of it. If everything in this book were true, I think we'd all be dead by now. But there is a lot I do agree with and think I will have better health because of what I have learned from it. I highly recommend it."
5,Most amazing must read ever,"This book is life changing. Even if you never make one of the many recipes, read the educational sections. It is so informative. There are also many blogs you can view for support with implementing a ""traditional diet"" as described here. I also recommend The Makers Diet by Dr. Jordan Rubin and you can view my blog for my tips and also some links to some other blogs. Copy and paste this link in your browser for my blog: [...] Follow this link for The Maker's DietThe Maker's Diet: The 40-day health experience that will change your life forever"
5,Beyond Cooking!,"This cookbook is much more than a cookbook. It is wonderfully loaded with nutrition facts and recipes throughout the book based on healthy peoples. It is a nutrition book within a cookbook. YOu will learn more from this book than all the information you've ever gleaned on nutrition. And if you apply the information, you will live better and longer, and so will your offspring."
5,Nutrition to be heard and shared,"The vast majority of reviews speak about the quality of this book and its value in nutrition. We have been making changes in our ""diets"" and are thankful for the work outlined in this book. Highly recommended!A great resource link: [...]"
5,Nourishing Traditions,"This book should be required reading for all medical persons especially MDs. It belongs in every household in America. If it were, there would be far less desease and death due to improper nutrition in this country. The AMA and FDA probably hate this book because it correctly addresses some of the controversial subjects such as cholesterol, fats and sugars. Dr. Mary Enig and Sally Fallon are the real experts in the field, at least they understand physiology, not the AMA or FDA. It is a healthy cookbook."
5,life changing,"The information in this book nearly brought me to tears. It gave me hope that my food allergic son might be able to eat milk and bread again!It is well organized, and full of information from many sources."
3,On the Fence,"There is a ton of information in this book...some I believe, other stuff that is simply too far-fetched. Some interesting recipes...then many that are just too revolting to even contemplate making--meat byproducts, for instance.Also, one would have to spend about 3 hours a day to cook this way....impractical. I have a friend who abides by this book and all she does is cook. All the time. That said, some interesting stuff here...just take it all with a grain of salt. (pun intended.)"
4,Back to basics and common sense,"LOVED, loved, loved this book. Great Anatomy and Physiology review of how the body works and why to eat natural foods. Loads of common sense and the recipies are easy and yummy!"
5,Fantastic Nurtrition Resource,I absolutely love this book. It was recommended by my Naturopath. I also bought one for a friend who is as excited about it as I am. It has very sound nutritional information that does go against much of what we are told today however as someone who works in the medical profession I feel that the book is right on. I am also seeing great results in my own health. I highly recommend this book.
5,THE book for restoring your health,"Nourishing Traditions is the one book that shows you what to eat and why. In our current nutritional environment, we need a foundational source of truth to rely on; this is documented, evidence-based metabolic health. Keep this on hand to be your guide, along with a knowledgeable health practitioner, to recovering your own health."
4,A Little Quirky,"I thought I knew a lot about nutrition until I read this book. While some of the recipes seem very strange, ""Make Your own Whey!"" and some ingredients I have never been able to find, the book has been very helpful, especially the section on feeding babies, and the tidbits of information in the sidebars is great."
2,Dissapointing,"I am a great admirer of Dr Weston Price, but feel this book distorts that great man's message, even though the author is president of a foundation named in his favour and this book is inspired by his research.In particular the most egregious flaws in this book is that it gives too much emphasis on the undesirability of pasteurized milk (which Dr Price himself never had a problem with).The book also fails to give enough weight to the evils of sugar, processed food and vitamin/mineral deficiencies causing serious physical and mental problems in modern societies as well as the pre-natal damage Dr Price found so alarming.On the other hand it give far too mch empahsis to esoteric idiosyncracies like fermented foods and drinks, coconut oil, cod liver oil and so called ""super foods"" like bees pollen.In my view, skip this book and read Dr Price's original and timeless classic ""Nutrition and Physical Degeneration""."
5,A fantastic find!,"This is a fantastic book. Yes, it is full of information and can overwhelm a reader easily if one attempts to read it from cover to cover in one sitting! This book is meant for ""mental digestion"" over time... Reading one section at a time and practicing with recipes is the key to enjoying the knowledge within this book. I am grateful to have found it. It reinforces my personal believes about traditional meal preparation and the spiritual experience of enjoying a meal with my family, friends and community. Thank you for this dense, detailed, at times overwhelming, excellent collection of nutritional wisdom!"
4,Very informative!,"Hello. I just want to say that the book is very informative. The recipe's aren't difficult, just takes some time to prepare. Im enjoying the book, except for the raw meat chapter, its not really my thing, personally. But overall, most of the recipes are from different cultures and folk. I enjoy the side bars which are full of interesting articles.One thing I didnt like is the recipe for the Russian 'Kvass'. Her recipe takes a month to prepare/ferment. T=Its actually much simpler then that, if you look online, you'll find other recipes very similar but it takes 3- 5 days. Thank you! :) God bless!"
5,How to make healthy food,"I have been enjoying eating as exclusively out of this book as possible for several months. I really mostly care about health, but it is nice that all the recipes taste great. When I want to prepare food, instead of wandering around the internet I now simply open this book."
5,Nourishing Traditions,"This book is great. It is not only a recipe book, it has so much nutritional information jam packed into one book. I highly recommend this book, if you are getting into eating nutritionally, the way God intended for us to eat."
1,Awful!,"I enjoyed Weston Price's book very much, which simply served to deepen my disappointment in Nourishing Traditions. As a professional head chef with 20 years experience on the line, I defy anyone to actually eat the dishes created from these horrible recipes. Nearly every recipe makes fundamental mistakes that will destroy otherwise good ingredients. They should call it ""Nourishing Transgressions""! Save your money for a cookbook written by someone who knows how to boil water."
2,Just Bad Recipes,"Despite how you may feel about the tone, ideas or science in this book, the important factor for me is that the recipes are not good, period. I purchased this book in an attempt to find good recipes for cooking breads, whole grains and organ meats (liver recipes are difficult to find in everyday cookbooks). I could not find one. If you like food, do not get this book. There are other books out there with far better recipes for everything. I tried several in this book with limited success. And I am no rookie in the kitchen. So to stick with the important concept of a cookbook, THE FOOD, I would have to say that this one is a waste of money and I am sending mine back."
5,It's My Food Bible,"I can't say enough about this book. It's a research book. It's a cookbook. If I could only save one thing from my burning house, it might be my ear marked NT book. Seriously."
4,Very enlightening,"Makes sense to go back to how we ate in grandma's days. True honest food, no processed food, simple is the key!"
4,Not bad,"Interesting read. Some of the recipes are weird and hard to make, some are great. Some very good nutritional tips."
5,Finally Food Information and Preparation That Makes Sense,"This cookbook is revolutionary and I am so glad to have this as a resource for my family! I knew processed food was bad, but what an eye-opener to have the detailed documentation to prove it, as well as accurate information and recipes to create nutritious and delicious alternatives. I love this book and have already enthusiastically recommended it to friends and family."
4,Natural Yeast Bread,I can't really leave a fair review of the book since I only tried one of the recipes so far but I was terribly dissappointed with the Natural Yeast Bread recipe. Has anyone tried this recipe? I should have known better as I have attempted many times to bake using only whole grain flours. When buying whole grain breads from the store I have noticed in the ingredients that they add white flour to make it light and fluffy. Is white flour unhealthy to eat if you add it to whole grain flour? I don't know and was not able to find this information in this book.
2,Nourishing Traditions review:,"This book was not what I expected. It did have some useful addresses in the back, however, it did not seem any different from other natural healing cookbooks that I already had. It did not have the calorie counts and breakdown which I would have liked since my husband follows Weight Watchers and needs a point breakdown of nutritional values. So I returned it."
1,Not Worth It,"Some of the info in this book is correct, but enough is wrong to warrant not buying it. For example, the emphasis on dairy. Research consistently shows that dairy is not healthy for humans. Sally Fallon isn't a scientist, she's as likely to be misinformed as we are. Want to read a book written by a scientist where everything is correct and will work for everyone? The Paleo Diet by Loren Cordain, Ph.D. is the book. Read it and everything will make sense, and your health will be as good as is humanly possible."
1,this book is a joke right?,"unbelievable ! This book advocates eating raw meat, full cream butter/milk, lots of fatty dairy products. It belongs to a time when men where men and women cooked in the kitchen. And real men hunted and killed their own meat. There have been numerous studies linking the kind of diet this book recommends to bad health. If you want a proper book on eating backed up with proper scientific studies then I would highly recommend 'The China Study' by Dr. T. Colin Campbell. What are the author's credentials anyway, is she a nutritionist? NO, is she a Doctor? NO, is she perhaps a research scientist? NO."
1,Definitely Not,"People will buy anything. Our ancestors ate terribly and only lived to be 50 at most. Why would we want to eat like them again. I agree in not eating processed foods and the less perservatives the better, but everything else is just not even common sense."
1,Nourishing Traditions,"There is a reason people died young in years past...eating from this book pretty much explains it. I'm sure I'll catch a lot of flack for this review, but ""oh well"", at least I'll be around to read them."
2,I Was Underwhelmed. . .,"Some friends had referenced some recipes and ideas from this book, so I got a copy. I'm totally underwhelmed. The attitude and tone of the book, starting with the pergorative ""Diet Dictocrats"" put me off to anything good that may have been found within it.I did find it interesting to find a recipe for the Russian fermented drink, Kvas."
5,A nutritional treasure!,"For anyone who has decided they are uncomfortable eating the chemical laden foods the agri-giants are producing, this book is an excellent source ofinformation. Some things can be a bit extreme but it's all interesting and in a very readable format."
4,Unique.,"I consider this book a ""must have"" for anyone interested in challenging conventional ideas that fat is bad, ideas that devalue the importance of ""good bacteria,"" that think homemade stock and canned broth are interchangeable, etc. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I don't LOVE Sally Fallon's recipes, overall. I think she's labeled as a ""gourmet cook"" somewhere and I have to say ""mmm?.."" The book is chock-full, however, and something I consider a wonderful resource - especially for things like home-brewed dairy products, lacto-fermented veggies and naturally leavened baked goods."
5,This Working Mom's Go-To Cookbook,"I learned very little about how to prepare traditional foods while I was growing up. I love the way science, nutrition, advice and wonderful recipes come together in Nourishing Traditions.After learning to spend 10 minutes each evening planning the next day's meals for my family of five, I have been able to provide my family with healthy meals and work my 60+ hour a week job.My children are rarely sick and they love to help prepare dinner with me. Unlike many of their friends, they eat everything. They eat like linebackers while at the same time they are slimmer and more muscular than most of their playmates.Sure, I spend more money on free-range meat and organic vegetables, but I'd rather spend money nourishing my children than on medical bills. It really does come down to one or the other these days.Nourishing Traditions is my go-to cookbook! I highly recommend a traditional diet and Nourishing Traditions!"
3,It's ok,"Would have liked to see some real traditional recipes. This is far from traditional and many recipes contradict her philosophies. I was hoping to remove phytic acid from my diet not add more. I realize the preparation would be a lot of work, but would have liked the correct info in there as an option. Many recipes just have flour as an ingredient without any special preparation. A traditional dosa made with brown rice? Also using flour all over the place as a thickener. Some recipes said cook 1st ingredient in a mixture of butter and olive oil (traditional?) till browned, pour out browned oil, add more butter and olive oil cook 2nd ingredient till browned por out browned oil, then add broth. That seems very wasteful and I can't imagine it is remotely traditional. If I am using grass fed butter and local cold pressed olive oil, I certainly don't want to just burn it and throw it out. I use it like any other cookbook and do what I feel like, using it as a loose general guide."
5,true healthy eating,one of the best books on the market if you want to find out where your food really comes from and what has been done to it. heaps of good information and also many great recipies
5,LIFE CHANGING,"This book has changed my family's life! My mother, a Doctor, has thrown away everything she learned in medical school regarding nutrition out the window. I believe this book is as necessary in the kitchen as pots and pans. It is a bit of a read. A lot of large words and pretty scientific, but just read it, get out the dictionary if need be. I promise, that if you want a happier and more healthy life, this is the book you want to read."
3,Hard to rate,"This album is really hard to rate. On the one hand you have the greatness of Chucho and his band playing live songs like ""To Bud Powell"", ""Como Traigo la Yuca"" and ""Punto Cubano"" (probably the best in the album).On the other hand you have the awful production that makes the sound very dark, drums and bass very weak so you lose a lot of the music.It's hard to understand how a Blue Note production gets to give such a bad sound to such a great music."
2,what's wrong with the recording engineers at Blue Note?,"The good news is that Chucho Valdes put some very interesting latin-flavored jazz songs on this CD. Based solely on the songs on the CD I would give this CD 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, the sound quality of this CD is extremely poor in comparison to other CDs: the sound is extremely muted and lacking in energy, clarity and sound stage. Compared to vibrant live recordings, like ""Dee Dee Bridgewater Live at Yoshi's,"" you have to wonder what's wrong with the folks at Blue Note."
3,A Solid Live Performance,"I picked this up after ""briyumba palo congo"", and thought it was just ok. compared to briyumba, this doesn't have as much spice. But it was worth the purchase."
1,Sound Quality Stinks,"I bought this CD when it first came out a few years ago. Something didn't click; it just didn't sound right. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the problem is with the recording quality, which sounds very muted.Although I am a huge fan of Chucho, I gave this CD to a friend. I just got mad every time I heard it, wanting it to sound good.If the record company were to remaster the CD and improve the sound quality, this CD would be a terrific addition to your collection.Oh, and it would even be better without the vocal track featuring Chucho's sister. . . but that's just my bias against vocals in latin jazz records."
1,Poor sound quality.,"A couple of prior reviewers have it right on: the sound quality of this CD stinks.It's a shame and waste of the band's talent and skill. Live on stage, these folk are wonderful. Too bad the recording technicians screwed up.It's just that there is something wrong with the sound quality of this CD. I bought it despite the warning from the prior reviewers, and regret spending my money on it. Well, at least it will make a nice gift for a new Chucho fan."
5,very good,I agree that it appears to be juvenile with the cover drawing. But if you like scary stories that make you wonder about such strange activity it will certainly deliver. A lot of historic hauntings but my fav part was the poltergeist activity.
3,Not Bad,Not a bad production... The Arona fight was cool to watch... not to mention the never before seen footage of Eddie Bravo backstage... also that I learned a new escape from the half guard LOL...All in all not bad... and I bought this new for 10.25 so I really cant complain....
3,"Interesting matches, a bit expensive.","I bought this for the Royler vs. Joao Roque match and, to that extent, I was not disappointed. Everything else left me feeling a bit cheated; specifically, as was previously mentioned, the quality of the production."
2,Disappointing,"I was surprised at how boring much of the dvd turned out to be. Also, the behind the scenes material was amateurish.Jean Jac Machado looked great. That's one thing I can say for the dvd. I am a big fan of Renzo Gracie but I didn't see much here. I really can't recommend this dvd."
2,Elvis Presley Costume Wig,"I was hoping the wig would look something like the picture but it really doesn't. Maybe if you're a professional wig styler you can make it look like that, but that's definitely not the way it comes out of the package. Oh yeah, and while I was trying to style it to make it look acceptable, it shed like crazy."
4,This product left my face tingling and refreshed. ...,"This product left my face tingling and refreshed. I didn't experience the burning sensation that I get with some products, especially around my eyes, which I really appreciated. I was amazed that it even cleaned my face when I used it right after my shower. The only downside was the fact that it left my face a little dried out. It wasn't really dry, but just enough that I noticed it. Other than that, I give this product a thumbs up, and I'd recommend it to family and friends."
5,My face felt and looked a lot cleaner ...,"My face felt and looked a lot cleaner and fresher after using the Pond's Clear Solutions, Pore Clarifying Astringent. I'd definitely recommend this product to others, and I'll be buying it from now on!"
4,Pond's Clear Solutions Pore Clarifying Astringent does a ...,Pond's Clear Solutions Pore Clarifying Astringent does a good job of tightening my pores and controlling shine. It wakes up my skin with its invigorating feel. It makes my skin feel alive. It didn't clog my pores. My face felt very clean after using it. There was no greasy or oily residue. I'd recommend this product to my friends.
1,"Delta 4"" Tool rest does not fit new 12"" Delta lathe","I had to return this prduct because the stem is not long enough to be held by the 12"" Delta wood lathe at a proper height.The banjo needs to be able to safely grasp the stem of the tool rest to hold the top at the centerline of the spindle. This tool rest is incapable of that. It would need to be about 1"" longer."
1,Amazon got it wrong,"There's nothing wrong with the tool rest, as far as I can tell, but the stem isn't long enough for the Model 1440 Delta model lathe that I have. The wierd part is that I bought the lathe from Amazon a couple years ago, and about two weeks ago they showed me this tool rest and said that since I had bought the 1440, I might like to buy this tool rest. As it happens, I did want a short tool rest so I ordered it. Well, it doesn't fit the 1440 because the stem places your tool too low."
1,The material is not what I expect,"I bought 2 pair s/s bodysuit & legings (sweatpea & you are my sunshine) 6-12mos,when I receive the package after waiting one week of shipping I can not wait to put the dress on my baby,only after one day the fabric is loosing at the leg,and so as the bodysuit the sewing did not do a good job for this product and the material is not stay in the same shape after one wash."
3,Cute onesie but quality is lacking,"This is a cute onesie but the very first time my daughter wore it, the side seam began fraying/tearing. Not what you'd expect from a $24 onesie. Additionally, the fabric is quite thin compared to onesies from Carter's or Old Navy.The pants are better quality than the onesie and have held up well to washing and wearing."
1,this copy was junk,"This was sold as new, but was actually junk.. the record itself is a good record as are most of Jim Reeves records"
3,Bizarre and risque horror film,"I was surprised by the violence, nudity and dark quality of this Mexican horror film. It was scary and quite disturbing at times. I would not reccomend it as a stellar film but it is worth the watch."
5,Best of the lot,This compilation of music is in my opinion the best of the lot to have come from the Olsens. It also contains the more songs written by Glen Bennet than on any other album. Bennet's writing absolutely shines! Add those two twins and you've got a masterpiece.
1,Lousy,Mary-Kate and Ashley are cute and they do have talent. They just aren't singers. This CD stinks. Tired surfing cliche is not cute coming out of them. They are too old to pass that one off. The songs are all infantile and stupid. These kids are way past this stage and they can do better things with their time instead of stupid stuff like this.
1,british trash,Pretty dumb movie. Its a one time deal. Supposed to be funny but all I did was groan. If I had it to do over I would not have wasted my $.
5,I have very dry skin and the Nivea ...,"I have very dry skin and the Nivea Body Sheer Moisture Spray has done wonders for it. The spray application isn't nearly as messy as a pump or a tube, and it doesn't feel greasy or oily when I rub it in. It feels much lighter than normal lotions, but it lasts so much longer! I love the light fragrance as well and I'd recommend it to anyone with dry skin."
4,This lotion works very well. It smells nice ...,This lotion works very well. It smells nice and makes my skin very soft. I was using a different lotion on my hands and had to use it over again a few hours later because they would get dry. I didn't have to do this with Nivea. My hands stayed soft all day. But I think it's too expensive to buy again and again. I'd buy it and recommend it to friends and family if cost weren't an issue.
3,I used this product after a shower. It ...,I used this product after a shower. It went on and rubbed into my skin easily. I found that for a while my skin was soft but after a while my skin was dry again. I needed to apply lotion after about two hours. I also didn't like the fragrance. This product may work for people that have normal skin but didn't work well on my dry skin.
4,"Pretty Cool, Not Long Enough","I had been waiting to see this ever since I read about Sum 41 being evacuated out of the Congo. From an entertainment standpoint, this was pretty interesting. I mean certainly not Hollywood material, but you really get to know the guys in the band. Everyone's true colors show up when they're next to death, and these are some genuine guys.The main purpose of this documentary, however, was to inform people about the war in the Congo. I have to say they did so flawlessly. I knew nothing about the Congo and now I feel like I could tell what's going on. The only war resulting in more deaths was WWII!! See that's some stuff you learn.So basically, get this DVD so you can be aware, not to mention raise money for all those children in Africa. Too bad it didn't last longer......"
1,Fascinating Study of 1980s-era Conservative Christian Agitprop,"This book is a treasure trove of paranoid delusions, corny predictions and hackneyed prescriptions by authors from Ed Meese to Jerry Falwell to C. Everett Coop. You have everything from the Hidden Holocaust (abortion) to a major article on the Homosexual Menace (with pictures!) to the evils of women in the work place (in an article written in the 1980s, no less). No cultural anthropologist or historian should be without this book. Well worth the [...] cents to get a used copy."
1,Everyone in the video is hideous.,"This video would have been a lot easier to handle if the actors didn't look so ugly. The explicit sex scenes will make your stomach turn, its worse than walking in your parents!"
5,"A ""Must-Have"" Introduction to New Web Communication Tool","I just finished reading Ellen's book. For a year or more, I have seen webfeeds on some websites, and those little XML and RSS buttons showing up everywhere. For the life of me (and I'm pretty technosavvy), I just couldn't put it all in context. This book lays it out concisely and makes a compelling case that news and webfeeds are the next communication phenomenon, likely to be as ubiquitous as faxes and email.I'm not always a ""Dummies"" fan, but this one rocks! My website will have a feed very soon and I'm already thinking of many ways to use this new technology in creative marketing efforts and to deliver content in a more useful way to our clients.Colorado divorce and family mediator, Lawrence King, J.D.Divorce Resolutions, Colorado Center for Divorce Mediation"
4,Dr. Gwen reviews RSS Feeds for Dummies,"The best part about this resource is that it assumes nothing. It takes a complete novice and explains that RSS means really simple syndication. Then it goes into the value of having changing content, the need to choose an RSS that is not only compatible with your content, but will add ever-changing, relevant content. I am using the resource to be sure that I have an accurate understanding of what it is, who it helps, how it helps, when to use one, and how to subscribe to an RSS Feed."
3,Some Missing Coverage,"While I do like this book, and basically agree with most of the reviews here, I was frankly suprised that during the discussion of RSS with Blogs, WordPress was left out. Not even an entry in the index.Blogger, Movable Type, TypePad, LiveJournal, etc were all discussed. How can you leave out WordPress, one of the Major players in the blogging market? Maybe not a big deal, but it does make me wonder what else was left out?"
3,It would have been great at half the length,"The author took much too long in getting where she needed to go. I wanted a ""how to"" book from the getgo and this was not it. I did not need to wade through all kinds of minutia to get to the heart of the matter. I wanted to sit down and do a rss feed and she took about 5 unnecessary chapters to get there."
1,A Rip-Off,"This was a total disappointment, essentially one typewritten page. There is more biographical information on wikipedia for free. I felt cheated."
3,"Older board, loses sync sometimes, don’t throw away your old keyboard.","Product underperforms, it loses sync with he computer often which is a PROBLEM.If I could do it over I’d get the newer keyboard."
2,thought it was newer,"I chose this rating cause the keyboard is a 2005 ,,,,,,,,would have thought paying that much it would have been newer"
2,Disappointed - bait and switch,"Did not come as advertised in a box,with foam protection on each side of the keyboard,also they did not send the mouse. The keyboard box advertised looked as thought it was from Apple. It stead the only thing sent to me was a bubble wrapped white keyboard. Concerned this item is refurbished. Very disappointed."
5,Great Keyboard,"I purchased this item a couple of months ago from the Apple Store after having bought a 12"" powerBook (which I love). So far, I am very happy with the keyboard. It's comfortable to type on (my biggest concern) for long periods of time; the key action feels good. I solved the battery problem by getting a set of rechargeable batteries. I haven't used it a great deal, but I haven't had to recharge them yet. It's also not clunky like so many other keyboards, and the wireless function works flawlessly."
2,Keys Stick - Poorly Made,"You simply cannot type fast on this keyboard, the keys are too stiff and stick somewhat. It gets dirty awfully fast also due to the white color. I've owned it since 2006 (4+ years). Not recommended."
4,Nice Keyboard,The keyboard is nice and has the right side number keypad which thenewer apple keyboard donot.
5,Great Wireless Keyboard,"Setup was quick and painless. They keyboard has a nice look, and it well built. Most important, it works great. I use it at home with my MacBook. When I want to take the Macbook on the go, I just unhook the power connection. With this wireless keyboard (plus a wireless mouse and Airport network), it is a breeze.This is the first wireless keyboard I've owned. I did not trust them before. This keyboard has not been a disappointment. To save battery life you can turn it off with a switch under the keyboard. Being lazy, I just keep it on at all times, unless I am away for an extended period, and replace the batteries every 4 months or so.Another great Apple product!"
5,Great Keyboard!!,"Perfect for a Mac. Battery Life is good and response rate is excellent. The only problem I have with this keyboard is the button placements. It's a bit different from a traditional 108 keyboard and that may affect gaming, but its just a personal preference. I highly recommend this keyboard, but it has no extra featues. If you're looking for a simple and reliable keyboard, this is the one. Otherwise you may want to look into a logitech or microsoft BT keyboard, since those are feature packed and made to satisfy windows users."
1,Goes Sour Fast,"I bought one of these a long time ago and liked it at first, even though it was pretty flakey, sometimes getting stuck and going on a runaway train ride of repeat characters. Then, suddenly, it started to feel like stale popcorn. I tried to clean it, nothing worked. Then I got a new Powermac Quad and ordered it w/this kb. Wow, I thought, they really fixed this thing, it's a joy. No flakey behavior, feels great. But alas, literally two months later it was back to sponge city.Avoid this one."
3,OK Keyboard,"I am somewhat disappointed with this keyboard. I have found that many times the letters typed do not translate to the computer, especially if I am typing rapidly. I may go back to my tried and true wired keyboard. I certainly would not buy this keyboard again."
2,connection problems,"This keyboard is great - if you don't have any connection problems. If you look at the forums at apple support, you'll realize that quite a few people who purchased this keyboard run into exactly that - bluetooth connection problems. Where all of a sudden, you'llllllll bbbbbbbe tyyyyyyyyyypinggggggg lllllllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiikkkkkkkkkkkkeeeeeee this. Aggravating - and there's really nothing that can be done to avoid it if you have the problem.... supposedly it's due to wireless interference.... but i've had to go back to using my wired keyboard."
3,Dispointed with the purchase process,"I initially purchased this product because the picture showed the NEW Apple keyboard. We were so excited when we made the purchase till we received our package. Quite dispointed when the older model arrived. The return process was easy. Thou there were misrepresentation of the item, still a loyal AMAZON shopper."
2,Not thrilled...,"I love Macs, but must say that I ordered this through Amazon to replace another brand. Though these have had no issues for other people I know, I spilled some water on it and it died. I even removed every key, cleaned it and let it dry, no luck. I use a wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard now....I love them."
2,Easily Broken,"Spill anything on this keyboard, and it breaks immediately.I've destroyed two by spilling small amounts of coffee on them. Even after immediate cleanup, the keyboards begin to freak out and start typing random characters, and since they cannot be taken apart for cleaning they become 100% useless.Save your money and get a cheap USB keyboard instead.These are junk,."
1,Avoid the Mouse,"I bought the mouse, followed the instructions, and ""found"" the device with no problems. However, since the mouse was ""discovered"" it was promptly lost. The mouse has remained dead. No response. I have re-discovered and reinstalled the firmware many times with no success.This mouse is dead.I will take the little white corpse of a mouse back to the retailer and stick with USB. I don't need wireless THIS bad.Avoid this purchase at all costs."
5,WIRELESS KEY BOARD FROM APPLE,SORRY PRODUCT IS NO LONGER MADE AS IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SMALL METAL ONE THAT REPLACED IT. I GOT THE SMALL ONE WITH MY iMAC AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH IT AS IT IS WAY TO SMALL
1,OVERPRICED,"I love my Mac, but I am sick and tired of how Apple nickels and dimes you for every little thing.Constant connection problems, cheap springs in the keyboard so that the keys don't pop back nicely, gets dirty really, really fast, and since you can't take it apart you can't clean it out easily.Because of all that these need to be replaced every year or two, and these are just too damn expensive for something that needs to be replaced that much.Sorry Apple, I like your computers but I will get my accessories elsewhere."
5,Love this keyboard!,"The keyboard lives up to its reputation. Long battery life. I use my ""board"" daily and replace the batteries about every 4 to 5 months."
2,NOT FOR IPAD. Fast battery burn. Other than that OK.,"DOES NOT WORK with the IPAD. Don't even think about it. May not work with newest Macs. This is a 9 year old design.With Duracells, it lasts over a month and gives some warning of battery failure. With 2000ma rechargeables, it lasts less than 2 weeks and gives no warning. (rechargeables have a slightly lower voltage, that is why.)The battery only quits when your character is in grave peril in a video game. Nonetheless I do recommend rechargeables. Have two sets, swap them when it goes, and run back and resurrect your character. I finally just heaved the keyboard. It wasn't worth it but YMMV.Other than that, Mrs. Link, it's an Apple product, and tip top in all other respects."
5,my daughter loves it!,My 2 year old daughter loves this dollhouse. She can play with it by herself for about an hour a day. She hasn't gotten bored with it. I think all the pieces are safely made. It's a quality product.
4,2 year old loves it,"My 2 year old daughter just received this toy for Christmas. She loves playing with it and it encourages her to use imaginitive play. My only complaint with this dollhouse, is that there isn't very much furniture that goes with it. I can't seem to find any to purchase separately either. Hopefully she won't lose interest too quickly with only the few things that come with it to play with."
4,Great for the Imagination.,My daughter received this toy for Christmas and she loved it. She's only 2 so the chunky furniture and dolls are perfect for her little hands. I also purchased all the accessories for all the rooms with it. This toy is great for pretend play. The actual doorbell sounds and telephone sounds are great. My 5 year old son sits and plays with her as well. They really enjoy the dollhouse they imagine being the mom and dad and it keeps them busy for hours.
3,I did not like the pictures,"Any book on Judo, Chin Na, or any grappling art needs above average pictures. I'm getting older but I thought the pictures in this book were at best average.The written content of the book I thought was very good. I just wish they would of spent more time putting larger more clear pictures in this book."
3,"Chin Na in Ground Fighting:Principles,Theory and Submission Holds for all martial styles",It provides a good basic history on groundfighting and basic techniques that can be mastered with some practice. Very honest and real.
1,Skip this book!,"Apparently self-published, this book is blatant quackery. It attempts to draw parallels between Olmec art and the arts of Asia and Africa, arguing that pre-Columbian voyagers, including Phoenicians, made their way to the Gulf Coast lowlands and either stayed there or otherwise left their mark (e.g., through trade). The book also delves into physical anthropology, juxtaposing images of Tibetans or Africans with Olmec sculptures and photos of Maya descendants. Pure hogwash! Steer clear of this book!"
1,cheap,"i just got this idem and its in the garbage already...lousy quality.hard to open and close each side.....water everywere....dont buy this one,,,check for others"
3,HOSE ADAPTER,The hose adapter is working pretty well. The drawback is that it is hard to tighten and it leaks a little.
1,broke,hard to turn. Hard to get shut off all the way. Then the left lever broke off in the off position so now useless.
5,Felco- Proven the best by the best in the trade,"We have used Felco's for over 35+ years and they always perform and are worth every penny. Not only are they easy to maintain and so well designed? THEY LAST and LAST. Parts are easy to get and they blades hold an edge well. I own the f-20,f-21 and f-22 and they always perform as expected. You get what you pay for. I still have my first pair of #2 hand pruners from about 1982? They are so well made and designed that I know I'll have them for another 30 years. Felco is the only way to go..... Swiss made quality is worth it."
4,great product--not quite heavy duty enough for us,"In my opinion, no one makes better shears than Felco, but these aren't quite heavy enough for our needs--we should have gotten the next size larger."
2,Big disappointment,"After enjoying the Felco #2 pruners, I tried these shears for pruning rose bushes...big disappointment! Pruning rose canes, it's just too short. Long handles work the best. I now use long telescoping shears made of fiberglass."
4,Swashbuckler,"Fun swashbuckler starring Stewart Granger, who takes in the orphan son of his old flame on the English coast. The lad discovers secrets that a gang of smugglers is trying to protect. Plenty of action, mystery, and danger. Look for Jack Elam in minor role of smuggler."
1,Where are the torches? Where are the pichforks? Where is the flaming tar?,"Filming ancient aspect films in newer (wider) i.s pandering, not creativity. The director out of shame at least, should have used the old Alan Smithy dodge. Waste of expensive film. We'd have a lot less of this nonsense if we made these guys pay the expense personally and up front."
2,movie Moonfleet,"The movie Moonfleet was kind of a disappointment for me. Stewart Granger looks and acts great but this movie has a rather dark tone which I find not very entertaining. This movie cannot hold a candle to Grangers "" Scaramouche"" ""Prisoner of Zenda "" or "" King Solomons Mines"""
4,Heart-shaped bowls x 3,"We got these as one of the gifts for the wife's Valentines. Good bowls. One minor imperfection on the middle-sized bowl. No big deal...Actually, it is a problem in the glazing, for those of you that know ceramics.Overall, nice. As a man, what more can I say about 3 [heart-shaped] bowls?I do like to cook, though ; so relieve yourself of imagined, chauvinistic thoughts! (LOL!)"
1,It does not do anything!!,"The product made it look and sound like there was Copper that you could put from the mine onto the freight car. The top of the freight car flips over from and ""empty"" position, to a ""full"" position. Nothing goes up the side of the conveyor belt of the mine, and nothing dumps into the train. This toy is utterly boring and a waste of money!"
5,An Acceptance Tale,I love the fact that this story teaches kids to be accepting of others with disabilities and to be compassionate. My daughters loved the book. With everything kids have to deal with today in schools I'm glad there are books like this one with a positive message.
1,negative five,"This is the kind of novel that gives the genre of women's fiction a bad name. Like Selina, one of the main characters, the book is shallow and manipulative. The so-called mystery upon which the plot depends has a solution that's obvious from the beginning. Most of the book is taken up with descriptions of houses and the antics of an over-sized dog. And the author's view of human beings is sit-com superficial, with all the enforced happy endings that such a view demands.The publisher wants you to believe that Willett is the equal of Maeve Binchy and Rosamund Pilcher. That's just not true. Skip this one and re-read The Shell Seekers instead."
2,A Rosamunde Pilcher wannabee,"This book was weak in all ways, I was disappointed to say the least. The characters were overly exaggerated in either their evil ways or their goodness. Having read a lot of books from England, Ireland, etc. I can say that the only British things about this book was that they occasionally drank tea, and their location. The plot ties up in a highly improbable way and still leaves things unfinished. My advice (if anyone cares) is stick with Rosamunde Pilcher... she is a sip of a hearty ale, versus a sip of light beer."
5,Such an enjoyable book,"I thought that I was quite original in comparing this book to the work of Maeve Binchy and Rosemund Pilcher at the peak of their careers. Then I noticed that this was a recurring theme in all the reviews. If you have read Binchy or Pilcher--enough said. No sex, no violence, no crime, and yet such an interesting and enjoyable book. If you're a voracious reader, then you anticipate most plot lines. Not this one. The characters all ring true--we've met them in real life. This novel is primarily descriptive of the English countryside, also focusing on character development. It tells such a good story. I highly recommend. One caveat: the word ""whilst"" is overused. You find yourself distracted and counting the number of ""whilsts""on each page. A little distracting, but not a deal breaker."
5,An excellent read but keep tissues by your chair!,"I loved this book. It is one of the many I return to every year or so to re-read and enjoy. Yes, it is sad, but there is something very precious and loving about this story. Highly recommended :)"
5,Excellent!,"I have become a Marcia Willett fan and this is one of her best in my opinion. The characters are likable and engaging and you feel like you really get to know them. Willett's writing style is a lot like Pilcher and Binchy. Very comfortable read. Also, the dogs in her stories are so charming and very important characters without being over done."
5,please read this book,"this story was told through poems, quotes, creative writing projects and journal entries. never does the author directly tell you the story. you basically rifle through this girls writing and learn her life. its not a page turner at the begining but knowing that the girls friend gets pregnant and a conflict ensues makes it worth reading. by the end, you cant stop reading for anything. the first book thats made me cry in years. you can totally relate to the girl if youve ever been through hardships like these ones, and if you havent, you can definitely sympathize. too good for words, and if i told you any of the rest of the story, id tell you the whole story, but you have to read it without a biased oppinion. this book is so much more than worth while."
2,Like a Moth,"I did not find the film enjoyable or worthwhile. It had no redeeming values. The actors and story line were poor and uninteresting,."
3,Full of Typos,"I'm going through this book and I'm on page 232. So far this book has contained many typos. In one place they had the code swapped between two different member functions. Also, class names are often wrong.The other comment I have is that you will definately need to suppliment the material in this book with reading from another book like Programming Windows With MFC which is an excellent book. I think the book is good in that it shows you the type of information you are expected to learn at this level, but the typos are annoying."
4,"Not much help for the test, but well worth the $.","I gave it 4 stars because the book did not help much with the exam itself. But it is definately worth the money. The two cds that come with the book bring an sql server 7.0 trial and a nice tutorial. The tutorial gives a good intro/review of C++ and OO, plenty of step by step examples and some nice videos that explain how messages are routed and how the document/view architecture works and a few others. The ratio of knowledge per dollar spent gets 5 stars in this book, but as far as help for the exam itself it gets 2.5 stars. This book alone will give you a 50% chance of passing the exam. I think that the test went a lot deeper into com/atl and the capabilities provided by specific interfaces than what the book talks about."
3,Follow up to too vague,"Just wrote and passed exam 70-016. As I suspected book does not go into enough depth for exam. Do not expect to pass the exam based on this book alone. However, I do think the book was very helpful for some aspects of the exam. You just need to use other more in depth sources."
4,Great Quality,"This is an off the warehouse shelf copy of what any DVD would come in, great product with exactly what you want in a bulk item. No complaints."
5,Work great,"i bought these to split up all the dvd/blue ray combo sets between my sister and i, and they work great. The plasic outter ""sleeve"" allows you to make a label and slip into it. I haven't had any problem with them at all."
1,caveat emptor,"****BEWARE****This is a Latin phrase book, ie, simple translations of verb and noun phrases, etc, but no proverbs or quotations. What you want is the ""Latin Phrases & Quotations"". I bought this by mistake and have regretted in perpetuum =(((("
1,Not great for dry skin,I was very excited to try this product but was very disappointed with the results. I would not recommend this to anyone who has dry skin.
5,Good workout for retired Sailor,"This is one of the best video workouts I have ever done. It is challening enough to make you sweat but still is not too hard.The very first time I tried it I almost didn't make it through do everything correctly. Now, I have noticed a big change as all the workouts are getting easier but still challenging. I especially liked the Ab workout. Overall this is a good workout for anybody who wants to tone up."
3,Hmmm,"I bought this item partially based on the 5 star review. I would say that there is no way that a person would mistake this ring as being real, near or far. It looks like inexpensive costume jewellery. Also the edges are really really sharp and when I do wear it catches on things and cuts me with the corners."
1,Written by the unenlightened,"I thought it was a waste of money. I thought it was going to be about the 72 names of G/D in the Torah but it lost validity when they started to call the hebrew names of G/D from ""The New Testament"". The works of the so called apostles would have been written in Aramaic not Hebrew. Then they try to include the Jesus of Nazareth figure in as part of the divine names of G/D. Another example of how unenlighted Gentiles are trying to make a fast buck at other people's expense."
2,Not fascinating unfortunately. A Family Saga for passing time.,"I usually feel compelled to read until I drop but it definitely didn't happen this time around with Geras' book.I loved her book ""Hester"" so I felt like getting this novel but it didn't cut it for me.It's slow, monotonous, and utterly simple. The book's appeal is partly in the twisting storyline and partly in the shameless escapism of the milieu . . . constant sunshine, a beautiful house and garden, enviable clothes and delicious food served at every opportunity but there was no gripping character to save the day.It's just a book to pass the time if you get stuck in the airport for 8 hours or so.Not splendid, just average."
4,Not the best Bellow- but every Bellow has something good,"I felt a certain tiredness in this work, a certain contrivance of a kind I did not feel in the most gripping Bellow works, Herzog, Seize the Day, Henderson the Rain King. But I also felt that old Bellow gift for inspired insight into life, a kind of reflectiveness on the everyday which makes a poetry of ' seeing'. The story here of the aging botanist in disappointed love as told by his botanist nephew does not in my judgment touch us in the deepest way .It's not the greatest Bellow but every Bellow has much to give."
1,Did I read the same book as the previous reveiwers?,"The only thing that impressed me was the number of sentences, paragraphs--pages, even--that this guy wrote without saying anything at all."
2,Not worth your money,I bought this game a while ago played it a couple of times and then traded it in right away this falls into the same category of almost all other 20 dollar games they suck the anamation and graphics in this game seem like I could have done a better job the story and guns and shooting are poor you hardly get any weapons or anything the stealth is a little cool but there is nothing in this game that will make you want to play it for a while I played this game maybe a total of 2 hours then traded it in this game is not recomended
4,it's ok.,"it's an ok game thats realy all I have to say, rent it first, but if want to buy it and run like a little sissy girl in the game, go right ahead."
3,Cute Story,"This book (unfortunately filled with typos) is a ""Cute"" story - a little hokie to say the least, but enjoyable nonetheless. It is almost as though one is reading three specific stories (not one of which would have held a reader's interest for long). The characters are fairly well defined and there is little left to the imagination as to how the book will end. It is probably a good read for a younger person (early teens perhaps)."
4,Enjoyable,This was the first book I bought to read on my ipad and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It kept me interested and reading whenever I could find the time ...
5,Didn't put it down until I finished!,"Since I've always enjoyed any book by Debbie Macomber, I should have known better than to start reading ""The Trouble with Angels"" when I went to bed. I ended up staying up until 4am finishing it! Just could not put it down until I found out how each of the angel's assignment ended. Very touching tale of how little things can change peoples' lives in a very positive way. After reading this story, I was hoping that I had a Shirley, Mercy, or Goodness angel looking out for me."
3,Trouble With Angels,A little to silly for me. Read like a story for teens. I do not regret reading it but I would not recommend it.
4,"Cute, predictable","The prolific Macomber strikes again! Not a life-changing read, but sweet and keeps your interest. Worth reading if you like the Angels series."
2,The Trouble with Angels,"I purchase this book for a quick reading during the Christmas Season, and was not even through the first chapter and took offense to the Anti-Catholic Comment. So, that ended it for me and her books, I am an avide reader and felt she wrote well, but she should realize that her reading base just might include some Catholics! Since, there are one billion of us. She would benefit from being more sensitive to other faiths , so all can enjoy her books."
5,Love this author,"Love this author and it was a great read through the holidays. Prompt service. Thanks again, will be looking for more"
3,Trouble with Angels is Enjoyable,"It's a nice book. A little cute, a pretty good romance, a bit of faith involved. It could be ""cleaned up a bit"" (proof reading, typos) and was not on a writing level that I'm used to. However, it was enjoyable and the story was very sweet. Worth reading if you enjoy the idea of angels working in our lives."
4,Good holiday reading,This was a great little story for the Christmas season. I especially like something like this to read during such a hectic season. It was fun and took my mind off some family problems.
4,Very cute book,I really enjoyed this book about three angels and how they helped the earth people. I would recommend it for others to read
1,The Trouble with Angels,"Sorry! My fault. This is a syrupy, sappy, book.. I know many people love this genre and they may find this one of the best of it's kind."
3,The Trouble with Angeels,The story was different from what I am used to. It was fun to read. Good character development.I liked the way she got back to the angels from time to time. .
1,Stupid,"This movie is very disappointing in SO many ways! Technically poor, mostly boring, mediocre performances from the actors, confusing and not accurate. Hector Babenco sure has done better things, such as Ironweed, Pixote or The Kiss of the Spider Woman. This movie could have been at least more honest on telling us the whole story about the police and immates clash at the Carandiru prison, which of course, wasn't motivated by a fight during a soccer game, and everybody who's informed about the events knows that, huh Hector? Instead of telling us the real story, Hector Babenco prefered to serve us with a stupid and inaccurate politically correct version of the things. HIS biased version of the things. It's more like watching a fiction movie. An awful fiction movie, I must add.Not worthy watching or renting this piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money with this, I regret wasting mine. I wish I could rate this movie 1/4 of a star because 1 star is waaay more more than it deserves."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Long and boring. Cameos/flashbacks of various prisoners as they explain to the doctor how they ended up in prison. Nothing extraordinary. Lousy filming/directing. Should never have received awards. I don't make movies but give me a camera and I could film it, asleep. No real tension in the riot, and I wish I could get my money back. (City of God,((about life in the slums of Brazil)) is one of the best movies you will ever see/real-to-life/with DVD option to see real footage). Powerful/natural acting/doesn't even seem like they're acting.When you view the documentary, you'll see that their characters were true to life, 100%. Note Interview of the Chief of Police who is very upfront and remarks that the police force is admittedly corrupt and exists only to protect the rich. Buy it, and you will enjoy and witness advanced/top notch/creative cinematography. This is for a collection."
1,Just a bunch of Errors. Only 1 track out of 9 downloaded,"I got a whole lot of Errors, and only one of nine tracks download. But at least I got a refund."
5,Love Robin,"Damn.....one of my 'all time' guitar hero's.....this is one record that got me thru school.....contains some of the most powerful guitar work that you'll ever hear, hands down.....Robin rivals even Jimi or Eric.....check it out and you'll see what I mean....."
4,A review of Kreyol syndikat's Unite,"Syndikat's album is a guaranteed winner.The listener will experience contemporary reggae at its best.There is a pleasant gathering of reggae rhythms. The result isan attractive variety that allures; unlike other albums thatsuck the life out of a particular rhythm or style, leaving the listener wanting to snooze instead of dance. The creole languageused by the musicians only enhances the Caribbean flavor, creating an authentic reggae experience. I recommend this CD to all who love reggae. My particular favorite is track #4, Samson and Delila. Enjoy!"
5,Good Price for Reconditioned Roto-Zip,"It definately arrived looking used (not bad), but seems to work fine. It would probably look the way it arrived after its first use anyway. Nice purchase of a recycled tool that I will rarely use as a DIY'er."
4,Roto Zip,"Got the RotoZip for quarter of the price and it worked like a charm. It has come in handy for a lot of small little jobs, that would have taken 10 times the time with the hand saw. Great product from that tool range."
4,This product was helpful in treating a pimple. ...,This product was helpful in treating a pimple. I confess I felt rather stupid sleeping with a small disk stuck to my face. It's a good thing my husband understands and uses them too. Now we can look silly together. I'd recommend it to others.
1,I didn't see any noticeable improvement using the ...,"I didn't see any noticeable improvement using the product as the packaging directed. It's not as effective as products I already use, and I wouldn't purchase it in future."
2,I didn't really like them. They stayed on ...,I didn't really like them. They stayed on well but didn't really do anything for me. I'm glad I tried them but I don't think I'd ever purchase them.
3,Ham on Wry,"Charles Laughton always gave acting his all; whether in high-budget epic or programmer, slumming or rising to the occasion, he remains extremely watchable. THE STRANGE DOOR is third-rate Universal melodramatic claptrap, not really horror, but it's worth a look to watch the portly Brit devour the scenery (and, in one scene unhappily reminiscent of his glory days as Henry VIII, a roast joint). Karloff isn't given much to do, except look menacing and lumber around unconvincingly in a couple of action scenes, and Sally Forrest shows why she didn't do many period films. Laughton, slaughtering French and co-stars alike with an air of wry self-amusement, is the whole show here."
1,NOT AT ALL,"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS ALBUM AT ALL!!! THE MUSIC SOUNDS SO SO SO OLD AND AS ONE PERSON SAID IN ITS REVIEW, IT SEEMS LIKE MYRIAM IS SINGING WHEN SHE IS DRUNK AND HEART BROKEN, I WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING BETTER FROM HER BUT SADLY, THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PLASTIC ARTIST."
5,wow amazing album truly deserves a lot of grammy nominations,"it is an amazing album i love every song of it , mazing vocals and production. remember her name she is an amazing artist and soon will be a world wide hit ."
1,Don't waste your money,"This singer got her start on the widely popular ""La Academia"" series on Mexican television (comparable to American Idol), however, as other competitions ensued, her popularity faded and her fan base marginalized. I don't recommend this album as it features covers in its large majority and the vocal stylings of this amateur are comparable to an agonizing sea terne. Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,AWFUL!!! A WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this CD cause it had great reviews, but I honestly do not know what people are thinking when they recommend it. Myriam is a housewife-at-karioke-on-friday-night-with-a-few-tequilas-and-a-broken-heart at best. She has absolutely NO talent at all and I would now recommend it to my worst enemy. All songs on this CD are poor attempts at singing, and barely reach a mediocre standard. If I were you and you are looking to find some good spanish music, look for Alex Ubago or Ana Gabriel, or if you are a die-hard fan of La Academia, the best bet is Yahir, who not only has original songs, but also performs amazingly well for a newcomer."
3,I Expected It to Work,"I was warned that the cd would be lacking a case and cover art, but I was unaware that the cd would not function properly. Two songs skip badly making the condition of the item lower than advertised. The delivery was punctual, and the transaction went well. I was just disapointed that two of the songs will not play accurately."
5,love it,"love my copper kettle fountain, relaxing noise as the water flows from the pitcher. Just enough room to plant two plants in the side, wish they were a little deeper."
1,Stay away!,"So when I bought this movie I thought I was making a good choice... oh how wrong I was... I found that this movie was very slow paced and was rather boring... now to fully understand the film, one must know something about argentine society because there are a lot a subtle critics about corruption etc... I was fully aware of these allusions as I've travelled and lived in Argentina, but it simply didn't help... this movie only had a few scences that were of any interest. I saw this movie for the first (and last) time with a group of about 10 friends, and at least 5 people fell asleep. There are so many wonderful Argentine films out there.... but this isn't one of them."
2,Good container...very dry wipes,I was very unhappy with the quality of these wipes. They are a nice thickness but far too dry. I would not recommend the wipes at all.
1,Your paying for a box,"I don't get it, the soft pack travel wipes have 30-40 wipes. This hard pack only has 16 wipes. For the same price with the soft package you get 2x as many wipes. I don't think 16 wipes is enough to even get through the day if you're traveling.These are soft flexible wipes that won't get damaged, why do they need to be in a hard case anyway? The soft pack will hold them just fine and takes up less space. Plus with a soft pack you can feel how many wipes are left by squeezing it.It seems to be that this is a product where you are just paying for packaging and not product. Some executive needed to come up with a new product to sell and this was the junk he came up with. It's a complete waste of money and in no way functional."
2,75 year old baby,"Due to a recent diagnosis, my internist recommended Huggies Natural Care wipes instead of toilet paper. I just purchased a 80 unit pak but on review of your carton, no sign whether individual wipes are 'flushable' as prominently displayed by your competitors on their package located on same self. Also, competitor clearly state, 'NO alcohol.' What's the scope Huggies?"
1,HORRIBLE,"I recently puchased the Rage Against the Machine Star Profile. The CD is an Audio Documentary. It includes 5 tracks of some guy talking about the band. A couple of interviews were put in the CD also. I found this CD to be a HUGE waste of money! The cd also comes with a 100 page full color picture book, which I found to be quite interesting. I would not recommend this CD to anyone."
1,Not worth it.,"Overall this is a very bad quality album and if you listen to just one of the sample clips you'll see why. So save you're money and if you really want to know about Rage, go to some private band web-sites."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to more of the sizzling passion between Steve and Ginny, and instead got a dumb breakup and hundreds of pages of them sleeping with far less interesting people. Their reconciliation at the end is completely unsatisfying. Re-read ""Sweet Savage Love"" instead."
5,Excellent,"I have wanted original copies of this set of books since I had the first one. When I received this copy, I found it in excellent shape for it's age, even better than the copy of the first book in the series I already owned. I was quite impressed and quite frankly, I was afraid to read it because I didn't want to ruin it. I read these books when back in the 80's and love the fact that I have beautiful original copies for my home library now. The story line is kept up to par with the arrogance and jealously of Steve and Ginny, and their timeless bond of the ultimate love. Of course, the characters are in constant turmoil, and it can be aggravating at times, but it is worth the read if you enjoy the plot."
5,Very Good Updated Metal,"I have the 666 release from the 80s and it was very good then. It seems that Angeles del Infierno keeps adapting to the times and are doing it pretty well. For all those Latinos out there, they will recognize the old mariachi classic ""El Rey"" turned into metal."
5,Great CD!,"This CD completes my Angeles del Infierno's collection. I really like the song Cae La Noche. The two balads; Sentimiento de Amor, and Yo Se Que Tu Estas Aqui are great."
3,Just okay...,"I was motivated to buy this product because its all natural ingredients. My daughter suffers from eczema and I worried about harsh artificial emollients.I actually have to disagree with the other reviewer - I find the smell harsh and medicinal. I could overlook that if I felt the product delivered - but alas it seemed to offer nothing special in terms of moisture. The worst part is its a very sticky oily cream so it leaves the skin messy for awhile after application. Not so great with a squirmy baby. And at about $11.00 a tube its no bargain either.I'm going back to my old standby, Lubriderm."
5,Wonderful Cream,My care givers all suggest this cream as a wonderful healing aid. I keep this item on the shelf in my home for the many times a bit of healing help becomes needed. Thanks for careful shipping.
2,Change in product formula,"Beware that the decades old formula (manufactured in the United States, yellow in color, with a sweet smell) for this lovely cream is no longer available. The company is now using instead the formula from its German manufacturer, which is white in color and has a medicinal odor. The new cream seems to do the job, but it's a more run-of-the-mill product, its special character gone."
1,More than disappointed,"I ordered this and needed fairly quick. Kept expecting it, kept expecting it, kept expecting it. Could have ordered from a hundred place. Then, i get an email saying the order was canceled. Yet here it is on the internet, still for sale!!!!!!! LOUSY WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE, BUB! About done with Amazon if this is what happens now. BTW, my little dog that needs this is dying. Has a very bad heart. Don't know how much longer he will be here and you people just screwed him and me!"
4,Red Coat,"I got the XL for my German Shorthair (female), and it's just the right size. This coat has a lot of hooks and straps to get in the right place, but once it's on, it stays in place really well. The fleece is also really soft and thick so it keeps my dog nice and toasty."
4,Cute,"Coat is cute and what I wanted, but was not made as shown in picture, but works for me. Would not pay a lot for this coat, but I did order it at a special price...I think I paid (inc. ship)..$15."
3,Very nice dog coat - but the size is not as large as advertised,"The coat is soft, warm, and the collar on it is really cute. It also has a good, secure strap to keep the coat on the dog comfortably. But the information about the coat said it ""is for Boxers, Chows, Dalmations and similar sized dogs."" No way! Luckily we have a two dogs, and although I bought this one for the larger dog it turns out that it does fit our smaller Blue Heeler/ Beagle mix."
5,Cute and warm!,"My 16-pound french bulldog can be hard to fit (girth 19""; neck 13"", length 15""), but this coat works great because of the adjustable velcro belt and collar. She has the medium which is a little long for her length-wise, but I just scrunch up the excess material above the belt a bit. The coat is made of thick fleece and is pretty nice quality. She looks so cute in it - we've already gotten compliments!"
5,Adorable!,"Purchased this for my 6 pound Papillon. It's adorable. The fabric isn't what it appears to be. I thought it would be more ""woolen"" like, but it's not. It's BETTER! It's a very, very soft material, more like a favorite blankie material and he loves this coat. He doesn't really like anything placed on him and this was no exception - until I got it on. Then he pranced around thinking he was too sexy for his coat! HA!When I took it off, he wanted me to put it back on. Weird! It's got to be the material.Well Done!"
4,Long night's journey into twilight.,"The only reason I didn't give Boseman & Lena five stars is that it isn't always easy to watch. It is, however, a superlative view into the effects of racism and Apartheid on Boseman & Lena, and Lena's internal struggle to understand the aftermath of its senseless brutality on their lives. Angela Bassett and Danny Glover do their best acting to date, in a performance that is not likely to become a best seller due to the subject matter. All in all, a powerful movie rendition of South African playwright Athol Fugard's transformational play."
4,My cat thanks me,I have used the CD at home and in the car when traveling with the cat. It did seemed to relax her a bit. Also had it playing at home when running the vaccuum cleaner and it seemed to help her calm her down because she normally doesn't like the vaccuum. Happy with purchase.
4,A Good Gift For Pets and Owners,"I bought this CD as a gift for my cat. He loves to listen to music with no words. He really enjoys this CD, and I am glad I bought it. However my cat's favorite CD is called Autumn Splendor. We bought it ages ago, but got him another one just in case he wears it out."
3,"Functional yes but pricey for ""Made in China""","Works better than my old technique (squeezing by hand). But at this price, I expected ""Made in USA"" or ""Made in Germany"". Instead the dam thing has plenty of german sounding words on its sticker ""Zitronen, GmBh, Markoberdorf etc etc"". There is a separate sticker confirming ""Made in China"".No need to pay this much for a ""German designed"" + ""Made in China"" Citrus reamer."
2,Near worthless,"It looks nice but you are better off just squeezing the food item with your hand. The yellowish head is small about the size of a medium lemon. Save your money and get a real juicer or something else. It is a novality item. If you do buy it, you will use it once to try it...then forget about it in the kitchen drawer."
5,"Great CD, even better in person. Highly recommended.","An excellent CD, filled with a great new song set and beautiful family harmonizing that can't be beat. It may be even better than their previous CD, ""Bluegrass Vagabonds"". I saw them at the Central Virginia Bluegrass Festival in Amelia, VA and they were great live. I highly recommend seeing them in person if you get the opportunity."
3,"Great for your CD player, maybe not for your Ipod","Cherryholmes is a terrific group and this is a terrific album. But when trying to transfer the CD to my IRiver, the third track repeatedly crashed the transfer process, and my Iriver. So, be prepared to return it, if this is important to you. And don't expect much of your money back -- Amazon's response was that it was not their mistake, so I had to pay the return postage and other costs."
4,Cherryholmes rocks,"I love the instrumentals on the Cherryholmes CD. The vocals need to mature a little but, ""Working Man"" and a few others make this Cd a must for my bluegrass collection. The vocals are a little more toward ""country"" which I like than the nasal, traditional, bluegrass. I can't wait for their next effort.I think the Skaggs family recognized a great new bluegrass family and put out a good CD."
4,Cherryholmes,I loved it! They could crossover to the mainstream country charts without any problems whats so ever. They mix country and bluegrass in such a way that you don't even realize it's a bluegrass CD.
4,Vampires in small-town America,House of Caine ended up being a quick read even though it is five hundred pages long. It was the perfect read for a lazy bank holiday. While the sexual tension that goes hand in hand with the vampire genre was present in this book it was thankfully not as overt as some books which gave more room for an interesting and complex plot than the more erotic ones.
3,"So, so, product","I had my MHCGX470 for half a year now, and use it for at least an hour a day. Lately I have been getting some high pitched sound when playing one CD, and have another one that skips on one song. It could be the CD has a slight defect, but I think it is the machine that is having the problems, or maybe I should say that it just isn't good enough to ignore any small problems with CD's. Anyhow, I think you are gambling a bit if buying this product. In the long run, Sony products never seem to stand up for me.Also another complaint is that the buttons don't light up in the dark, so you need to turn the lights on every time you want to make any changes.Don't expect a little system like this to fill your whole house with sound either. It does give nice sound for one room though.If you can buy some cheap extended warranty with this product go for it.A little update about this product... I have had it for 2 years now, and it still seems to be working ok."
1,really?,"This movie is like a very very very bad play- the story is nice, but the directing and acting performances are as bad as it gets."
5,No more Bees Wax,"Very nice live center with interchangeable ends. Value priced and works great, seems very durable with the large sealed ball bearing used."
4,"Well crafted, whole hearted grunge/rock.","Puller has really created an excellent Grunge/Rock album here. It's close to perfection, sometimes easily listening, sometimes rock out grunge. The vocals are passionate, and the instumentalists are talented. My favorites on the CD are ""Silent Film"", ""Out Of My Head"", and ""Light In Eve's Time"". However what makes me angry is this phenominal effort by Puller will probably go all but completely unnoticed. If you can ever find this CD you should pick it up for sure. You should enjoy Puller if you like Creed, Sunny Day Real Estate, or For Love Not Lisa."
4,my review:,"Puller's new album ""Closer Than You Think,"" takes the heavy postpunk styles of their previous album, ""Sugarless,"" and gives it a bit more of a sense of poppiness. The album definitely rocks with loud guitars, nifty drum parts, and solid vocals, with songs such as ""Would For You"" and ""She,"" along with some more slightly mellower songs like ""Silent Film,"" and ""If I Had These Things."" They experiment with some different guitar sounds and effects more than in their last album, almost in a ""melloncollie"" sort of way. Many of the lyrics deal with a person who struggles through everyday life, knowing that God is the only one who can help them through it, though they often fall short. While I hate to compare bands to other bands, especially when they do have their own sound, I would recommend this album to fans of Foo Fighters, Bush, and the late For Love Not Lisa (half of which is now in Puller). Overal! l, this is a good solid rock-n-roll record."
5,Just For You,"The Little Critter books by Mercer Mayer are my favorite books for the 2-4 age group. I love the pictures! I love the message that each story brings. The books are something special....They are keepers.From a grandma...don't give them away, don't donate them, you will pull them out one day....and be glad that you saved them. There is a wide variety of titles. Any one of them is a good place to start.mbt"
4,My nieces and I really enjoy Little Critter books,"They're short, they're funny, they're topical, and they're cheap.This must be one of the first ones - you can see that Little Critter isn't wearing his trademark overalls yet.He wants to do something special for his mom, but he keeps failing - until the end, when we find out that he succeeded after all. That might go over a young child's head - I guess he succeeded simply by trying? but it's a sweet sentiment anyway."
5,Sweet and funny!,My six year old son loved this book when it was read to him in class. He laughed so hard telling me the story! We will be picking this one up to have at home very soon.
2,This Is A Child Book,"I think this book was a bore for me.It was not a good book.If I was 3 I might like it.This book is not my catagorie of reading.I don't like to read but I read this book because I thought it might be good, but it wasn't."
4,My face is normally oily is most parts ...,My face is normally oily is most parts and dry in some. This scrub made my face feel soft and clean -- and didn't over-dry it either. I used it at night and noticed that my face was still soft and clean the next morning. It's helped control my once-a-month breakouts too. Great product!
5,Perfect size and sturdy.,I use this screen to cover my 90 gallon fish tank in which I keep my ball python. The open top provides great air flow and does not get too hot under my heat lamp. My only complaint is that the screen got pretty bent up during its shipping and required quite a bit of fixing. Spend a few extra dollars and buy it locally if you can.
2,Not too bad but lacking some focus,"The ""Bigfoot Terror"" set of 4 movies isn't the worst thing you could find but not too great either. I have a copy of the ""Legend of Bigfoot"" on several other sets and would have liked to see something different instead included. ""The Capture of Bigfoot"" is probably the most entertaining of the bunch for me. However, I would like to have seen more of the creature. It is a nice little bigfoot feature for those who like to watch these movies. ""Shriek of the Mutilated"" is hilarious and rather poorly done. The creature is laughable, though, there is more to it then initially meets the eye. ""Search for the Beast"" is just terrible. There is little focus or direction and many things seemed to be included to simply increase the run time. If you are into it, give it a look but not my cup of tea overall."
5,simply amazing,I loved this movie-watched it a few times on netflix. The way it is shot is really beautiful.. Some really great animal shots as well
1,"this is low grade junk,at best!!!!!!","WOW,this set of four movies is just the worst.the the four movies are all BAD,BAD,BAD and the transfers are just as bad!!!! SKIP IT!!!!!!!!"
3,Been There,"First off i have to admit that i have not yet even heard the set. with that said, i can say that i was at the second show in the three day weekend that was recorded. the gorge is by far the best place to see a show. i have been to multiple dave shows there and this one was by far the best as well as the second day being the best. i anticipate hearing this set and if it does its best to emulate the live show, it should be worth it."
1,Jump in the gorge,"because this ""music"" is not good at all. IF you considered it a waste, i don't blame you. If you want dave matthews get crash it is much better."
1,not another live album!,"my goodness.. how can anyone possibly want to hear these old school tunes time and time again? Matthews hasnt written anything good since '94. Give it up people. The nostalgia act can only go so far. Matthews has become an embarrassment. Gee, how many versions of Ants Marching do you need? And how can you possibly get off on it any longer?"
5,For anyone....you have to hear this album and the DVD,"I never had a favorite band for a long time, then one day it happened, Dave Matthews Band got me and has kept me. This CD and DVD are a testament to that. I know some will not think it is their greatest, but compared to what is out there now, DMB is still the best of what's around. The music is top notch, not all my faves, but still great. I am falling in love with Lie In Our Graves. The DVD makes me want to see them at the Gorge someday. But for now, I will have to enjoy their incredible concerts from DVD and the few times I can catch them near KC. Their music is for everyone. This CD and DVD is a great idea for both the die hards and the casual and a wonderful promo for The Gorge. Beautiful setting and great band."
4,"Overall, pretty good","This is a great album, but I feel that some of the tracks lack the energy that Dave Matthews Band can have when they're at their best. Since ""Everyday"" was not my favorite album, I was somewhat disappointed to hear a few of the songs from that album on this one. It was nice to have a live recording of ""The Song That Jane Likes"" since none of their previous live releases include this song. The DVD that comes with this album is awesome. The tracks are great, and the footage of the Gorge Amphitheatre is incredible; it is now my goal to see DMB there one of these days! This is a worthwhile buy for anyone who enjoys Dave Matthews Band."
2,Bad live album,I've had this CD for years now and I've only listened to it a few times and I don't have it in my ipod playlist because I find the sound quality unbearable. They sound off key and I'm pretty sure the people that were running the sound/mixing were wasted. All the other live albums are better than this one.
3,Buy the 6 Disk set,"This version of ""Live at The Gorge"" is ok, but the 6-disk version is much better. The 6-disk set of ""Live at The Gorge"" is recorded over a 3-day period and has some fantastic performances. You can only get it off the DMB site."
2,Live at the Gorge Review,"I'm a huge DMB Fan and have really been impressed with their other live cd's and DVD releases. However, I was pretty disappointed with this one. The reason being, the sound. To me the music sounds like it's missing something, like it needs to be ""fattened"" up. For instance, on Two Step whenever they go into what I call the chorus, you can vaguely hear Boyd's violin picking. I always look forward to that part of the song, but for some reason I can barely hear it. Dave's vocals don't sound as good either.I guess I'm just spoiled from the Central Park cd and DVD.However, even with the flaws I've mentioned, DMB are still some of the best musicians on the planet and do enjoy watching them play. I gave this a 2-star because I'm comparing it with other DMB albums put out."
4,best for my 2-3 year old,my child love this house she relates her house to our own home situation with her own doll family.
4,Lots of fun,"Our 2-year-old daughter got this doll house for Christmas, and it has quickly become a favorite. The pieces are just the right size, and I like its simplicity -- not too many bells and whistles."
2,Out of stock,"Order was accepted and credit card was charged. Several days later, was advised that product was out of stock, credit was given, but no info was offered on possibility of backorder."
3,Deanna Bogart - Decent Early Album,"This is another solid album from Deanna, although I don't think it ranks up with her best. Bogart's more recent material has followed a path into blues where her earlier work like this one has a lot more of a jazz influence. She still manages to mix blues and pop into the mix, but jazz and boogie woogie are the main components here. The album is a mix of Bogart originals and several covers including cool versions of ""Slipped Tripped Fell In Love"" and ""Tighter, Tighter"". Of the originals I think Bogart has improved as a songwriter immensely in the years since this album was released, but all of the tracks are at least decent. All in all I think I would recommend Bogart's more recent albums over this one, but it is another solid release in the Bogart catalogue."
2,Standards in Silouette,"In my opinion, this is 1959 album is rather weak Kenton. For me these Bill Mathieu arrangements just don't cut it compared to the powerful Kenton sound so characteristic of arrangements by Bill Russo, Lennie Niehaus, et al.I don't know, others seem to like it. I'll give it 2 stars just because of the excellent solos."
1,Horrible paint job and customer service,I received this along with a pink keyboard for my daughter for Christmas. The keyboard had paint missing and you could see the original color which is black. Then they promised to send new one and never did. Don't deal with these people. I know I never will purchase from them in the future.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I am a licensed aircraft mechanic so know a thing or two about maintenance. I bought this to do two things on my Durango - change the spark plugs and drain the engine coolant because I couldn't easily figure out how to do either on my own (coudn't find the coolant drain and the spark plugs have some strange connections). Guess what wasn't in the book? You got it. Like many of these types of books it'll tell you how to take the engine out but not stuff you really might actually do. I also had trouble getting the front wheel hub assembly off (really tight). I thought it would help but it was very basic - ""take bolts out, then remove"" kind of help. Thanks a lot. So overall, I wish I hadn't bought it because the three times I tried to use it it didn't help at all. That being said, it was still better than the Haynes I used to have with my Jeep Cherokee."
5,"Marc, not Marcus","I just wanted everyone to know that it was Marc Miller, not Marcus Miller who played bass on this. They are not the same person"
5,Great for inclusive schools,"If you are working to support students on the playground, in after-school programs, or just in the context of daily social interactions in the classroom, you need this book. It is filled with great ideas for teaching new skills, helping students learn about play, and creating inclusive social opportunities in general."
2,Not much there.,"I have used the entertainment book for years and found it a good value and resource. I was expecting the same out of this but that was not the case. Not much in there. No fast food places, discounts and attractions or other services. Save your money."
2,Garmin Savers Guide,"I am pretty dissapointed with the Savers Card.We couldn't find any hotels to use it at while traveling from southern California to northern California and back.We also were unhappy about a restaurant that denied a discount (Ihop). I reported it to the membership department but have yet to recieve a reply.Knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased the card."
1,Southern trip,"I used this product on a trip through western Arkansas, north and central Louisiana, and Houston TX. It was useless!"
1,Really?,"$1,077,536,368,554,180.00 seems like a VERY outrageous price for a membership card. I will never spend this much money again, i hate it."
2,Not worth it,"I don't blame Garmin, but many of the merchants don't honor this card. The 4 or 5 places I visited while traveling already had specials that were better than the ones listed with this membership. Several of them looked at the card and thought it was some kind of hoax."
1,waste of your money,"I did not use card once in the year I had it. I am an avid entertainment book user. I thought this would have those types of same deals. It did not have the same caliber of venues/restaurants as I would see in an entertainment book. I was surprised how few deals/places it did have. I live in Seattle and could never find a discount to use, event when I traveled I still found that it was not worth it.As another reviewer said ""No fast food places, discounts and attractions or other services. Save your money.""I wish I had read the reviews before I bought, don't make my same mistake."
1,And to think I paid the full price...,"that full price being $1,077,536,368,554,180. insane, huge waste of money. I can't believe I got this junk. I am very sad and my company is not broke and so are both cards.totally and utterly saddened by such a purchase as this. I still cannot believe it. luckily I returned it got a refund, otherwise I'd be out of business bc of this junk.I really thought using this would improve business/profits etc.Hopefully the next Secure digital card that comes onto the market will not only work better but cost a lot less than this one as well."
5,The Best,"Paheli was the best, when you watch this movie all your senses go to work. You cry, laugh, this movie was even enjoyed by young kids and its hard to find movies these days that kids will sit long enough to watch. Roni was extremely good with her scenes and lines. SRK <well I don't need to say much for him> as normal for him he out did himself again!"
4,Love is all you need...,"The Beatles sang it, and Bollywood proves it time and again: Love is all you need! This time, a Ghost falls in love with a lonely young bride left alone on her wedding night by her new husband who is more of a dutiful son and businessman than a lover. This beautiful young woman faces the first choice she has had in her entire life - and it is a ""doosie!"" How to decide?? Honour, or love? Duty to the household and new husband or love? What will be the repurcussions when the groom returns after five years' time? What would YOU do in her place? I know what I would do! If nothing else, watch this video to see Shahrukh Khan in a mustache, and to watch his more serious and loving side - no obnoxious jokes at the expense of his loved one in Paheli. The subtle, enticing rhythm and vocals of Dheere Jalna are memorable without knocking your socks off, and the beautiful textures and colors will draw you into the story and the lives of the characters, living and dead!"
3,Watch out for embedded ads!,"I just received Paheli (brand new dvd) from an Amazon vendor and it had ads inserted throughout the entire movie and you couldn't skip over them. I had the same experience as another person who wrote earlier about the ads when they said""The ads are inserted at dramatic points and you can only fast forward through them - if you attempt to skip over them it takes you to the next scene."" This is the first Bollywood movie I ever bought-do all Bollywood movies have these ads? I did enjoy the movie very much when I wasn't fussing at the annoying ads that ruined the moods the movie was trying to set."
1,Shahrukh Khan not act,"Boring! This was another disappointment in my Bollywood viewing experience. Since the film folks of Mumbai turn out 3 films a day, it's inevitable that a majority will be uninspired dreck. Once again, Shahrukh Khan demonstrates his minimal acting talents and Rani Mukherjee can do little to rescue this helpless cinematic snoozer. If you're content with pretty colors and not very demanding of much else, including memorable song and dance numbers, then Paheli might amuse you."
3,Exotic & Colorful Romp Through Pakistan.,"This was a Bollywood production of an Indie musical containing lots of young women in colorful costumes and big smiles to bypass talent. They wore all kinds of makeup and jewelry to cover their faults. Supposedly a folk tale, it was a weird sort of extravagance complete with camels, men in turbans and gold earrings, nose jewels and lipstick painted dots on the foreheads of the dancing princesses. There were oxen pulling carts and the Indian version of women in distress.Interested only in securing a profitable marriage, as Dr. Z's wife did, they seek out ways to show their value and wealth. According to Zuleha, he told her father that he would return to America where he had obtained his training in the windy city, Chicago, Illinois, else he would marry a rich American woman. The talking dolls in the decorated tree was the only clever part of the film. But, I will admit, it was fast-paced and very colorful."
3,Good bootleg stuff,"This is basically a sort of legal bootleg, almost as random but with much better sound quality. Gems that make it worthwhile: the writing tapes and finished record of ""Soulful Old Man Sunshine"" and ""Loop de Loop"" (what fun); this weird mix of ""'Til I Die""; a brief piano rehearsal of ""Heroes and Villains"", and a live version of that song from years later that showed what a good live band they could be. Also interesting to note that they included the ""Bicycle Rider"" lines back into the song for live performances, which had not been in the released record. Also, good early versions of ""Break Away"" and ""Do It Again."""
5,Odds n Sods,"A great collection of songs. Lots of oddities and a lot of great material. My favorite is Brian's Back, with the soaring Carl Wilson vocals. This is not a soundtrack album so much as an incredible document of one of America's best bands in all of their glory. Three brothers, their cousin, and two friends.... Endless Harmony."
5,A great addition to my VHS/dvd music collection,"I own this and also the VHS release they did right after Dennis Wilson died in 1983 in that drowning accident (I just saw him days before at a concert, and Dennis came out on stage after everyons was offstage and bowed to audience thanking them for coming, and that has haunted me to this day)....I have been trying to find any live taped VHS or dvd's on many music groups I grew up with, and it is hard, as back then, it was about the music & concerts mainly and playing for the people and nobody thought about making videos to profit by later on in as is done today.... and the music still resonates today decades later saying something of it, the performers, the talent, and the sound they created to last so long in our hearts & minds..."
5,It really is Endless Harmony...,"These are songs that will last forever (hints the title). This cd is a behind-the-scenes, practices, and demos of the Beach Boys' songs. Buy this today!"
3,It did the job.,"It worked well. Unlike a regular thatcher machine that would leave all the crappings on the lawn, this let my mower bag it.I have a 2 blade 33"" mower so I bought 2 blades and put them on. I was happy with the results. My lawn is nice and green now."
3,Adapter Please!!!,"I bought this product and then discovered that there is no adapter that fit my Toro Recycler. I did not let that stop me, and rig up a get around so I could use the blade. The blade does a very good job, and using it with the grass bag certainly saves time. I have a rather large yard and there is no way I am going to use a de-thatch it by hand. I did not set the blade to tear up my lawn, just low enough to remove the dead stuff that came up rather easier. I just do not understand why there is not an adapter of the Toro Recycler. How hard would it be to include one in the package. It is just a small piece of metal with a hole in it. Just does not make a lot of sense."
4,Go with the metal,Glad I purchased this one versus the plastic spike version. It took a REAL beating and worked great.
5,Doctrine & Covenants,"I beed ti study this book during 2013. Since I commute to NYC 2 days a week, I can study it on the bus.It's a wonderful book!BarbiJ"
3,More disturbing than the previous books,"I recommend it, if merely to have some closure on the series. However, overall, I found this book much darker and more disturbing than the other two. Some of the scenes were really horrific, especially towards the end. And I thought that, unlike Pillars and Shadows (and the Jewels trilogy), House of Gaian didn't have enough romantic/light/funny moments to balance out the darkness. I finished the book late at night, but was too disturbed to get any sleep. On the positive side, there was some interesting information on the history of the witches and the Fae and some interesting new characters were introduced. Although it left some questions unanswered, I was fairly satisfied with the conclusion. It was a good series, but wasn't nearly as good as her Black Jewels Trilogy."
2,2.75 stars,"** spoiler alert ** It's really a 2.75 star, but I didn't want to click that extra star b/c I don't think it deserves to be rounded up. I love the Black Jewels series, but even in that series I was a little underwhelmed with how Bishop got rid of the bad queens.You see more depravity from the inquisitors in this book. In fact, it's even more sickening and heartbreaking. While reading it, I kept thinking, ""man I want at least a good 5 pages of them getting everything they have coming to them."" I was extremely disappointed. This book lacked redemption and it did not leave me happy. Most characters meet their mates in this book, but because there are so many people that pop up in this series, you get maybe one line or a paragraph saying ""oh they are now lovers."" It fell flat. Again, I'm going to go back to the first book and restate that Bishop created Lucian who I thought would be a character with more depth and interest than Neall, but she chose to demonize him for the rest of the series."
2,Not a Black Jewels clone.,"After thoroughly enjoying ""The Black Jewels"" novels I was delighted to see that Anne Bishop had released another series. The Tir Alainn Trilogy is perhaps not as entertaining as her earlier novels but still worth reading. Anne Bishop discloses a slightly more serious side in this novel and her characters are not quite as sympathetic as the ""Black Jewels"" family. She has tried to flesh out her new characters by making them more tragic and bleak (a Shakespearian effort) but has missed building our empathy and involvement in them and their story by a fine margin. House of Gaian (and the Tir Alainn Trilogy) is still vintage Anne Bishop and far better than her later efforts of ""Sebastion"" and Belladonna""."
5,A good ending,"This is a really good trilogy. This last book concludes the plot very well and really was an enjoyable read, despite the melancholy ending. I've really enjoyed re-reading this series for the first time, but I'm sad that I don't have any other books by Anne Bishop to read! She is a wonderful author, and she does a terrific job building new and fascinating worlds for her complex and interesting characters."
2,No Paean for Gaian,"What happened to Bishop? I loved her Black Jewels series, but this one seems like a regression. Was this her first novel? The characters are stiff or annoying, the plot too conceptual and obvious. The Back Jewels stories are creative, complex and interesting. She minimizes the boring black/bad vs. white/good split. For example, her twist of usually ""evil"" names used for places, and for characters who are often more good than bad. The Gaian story is simplistic and predictable. Skip it."
4,Good end to a trilogy,"This book closed the trilogy with great excitement. It follows the lines of the other books in the trilogy, yet at the same time is as different as the first book was from the second. I really enjoyed that Bishop could continue the story, but at the same time added changes that made all the books unique from each other. I would say that if you liked the first two, you will continue to enjoy the House of Gaian. Great for all fantasy lovers alike."
4,An action filled ending,"This book starts right where ""Shadow and Light"" ends.The Hunter is making ready to leave the west to gather an army that can fight against the Master Inquisitor. She has the power to force the fae into the fight, but there is a new Lady of the Moon, who might use her power to oppose this. And what about the Daughters and Sons of the Mother, will they leand their aid to the course ? Because the Master Inquisitor has found a new way to twist the magic he steals.The story includes all the characters we already know (and love) and introduces a few new important ones. The pace of the story is stunning, and it can at times be hard to follow because it jumps between people and places. So it thakes some concentration.But I like the story and you get the answers you have been waiting for: The story about the beginning of the fae and the witches."
4,Hang on for the Ending!!,I've read both the Black Jewels Trilogy and now the Tir Ailain trilogy. I will say that the Black Jewels is my favorite of the two but this trilogy has its highlights as well. This concluding installment tries valiantly to tie up the loose ends that were produced in the preceding 2 volumes and almost succeeds. This book has such a frantic pace in the last half that before you know it the war has come and gone and you really haven't realized it ever started. Bishop appears to have let the story grow in the telling and got too many storylines going to be able to adequately (in her fashion) bring them all to a justifiable conclusion within the confines of a 3 novel arc. This is still a highly entertaining read and will keep your interest especially when you reach the last half of each novel.Enjoy. Definitely worth checking out.
2,Old stock?,My wife has been wearing this fragrance for many years and she was not happy with this product...she suspected that it was old stock as the fragrance smell was 'off' and even the coloring was not quite right. I would have been better off paying full price at a department store.
3,It is just OK,"I ordered this product because I have used the Weleda body lotion and baby oil and loved them both. This product, however, did not help with my son's diaper rash. Desitin ointment worked best."
2,Disappointed,"I find it very hard to buy cookbooks sight unseen, and unfortunately I am not so pleased with this one. The positive reviews along with the book preview made me think I might like it, but it just isn't what I was looking for. Although it shows some photos of the completed dishes, it lacks many. I was looking for healthy ways to cook the Salmon without salt and oil added, but this book is at a loss for that. Some of the comments made by the author were not well received such as ""Giving exact directions on how to do this is next to impossible because everyone's oven is different, oven thermostats are unreliable, and it's very hard to come up with a salmon the exact weight you need for a particular recipe."" Although I took a few cooking tips from the book, it is unlikely that I will be preparing any of these recipes."
2,HMMMM.....,"HAVE TO SAY GREAT ART WORK FROM JIM LEE AND NOT BAD STORY FROM WRITER CARL POTTS SHOULD MAKE THIS A GREAT ONE OFF STORY FOR THE VIGILANTE PUNISHER BUT WELL....... THE PUNISHER HAVING A TANK BATTLE WITH HIS ARCH ENEMY THE SNIPER (WHO IS IN A HELICOPTER!)IS ALL ABIT LACKING IN EXCITMENT... AND I LIKE THE PINISHER PUNISHING CRIMINALS.... NOT F""?KING ABOUT IN WAR GAMES!!!!!!"
5,Cooper is completely out of print??,Glad to see that a large selection of Edmund Cooper's works will be coming to Kindle in late Sept 2011. He deserves much wider recognition as a great writer of social science fiction.
4,Pop five great game,Everything about this game is great except the color white on the light green disks does not show up well. Black would have made a much better color. Also it woule be even better if there were 2 boxes of draw cards so you don't go through them too quickly. But lots of fun playing as a game for adults and teenage and young adults.
4,Fun in a box!,"This game was a lot of fun,we played it for hours on New Years Eve and almost missed the ball drop b/c we were so consummed by it! It's more fun the more players you have; I would def. recommend this game, easy to learn and easy to play!"
4,Great Game,We had played this at a friends and loved it. We knew we needed it. The box was a little torn up but the game itself was in great shape.
5,Loads of Fun,We love to play this game with friends. Everyone always has a good time and a lot of laughs. Great for adults.
4,Fun game for people who like pop culture!,"This game is awesome! It's fun for groups of 4 or more. Even funner when you're playing with drunk friends. It's a simple game about famous people, fads, fashion, movies, and basically anything you see on tv. It's funner than the other Cranium games. I have the traditional Cranium game where it can get boring or frustrating because you have to be super smart to know half of whats in those cards. With Pop Cranium, the topics are simple, if you grew up with the popular toys, watched tv or movies, or remember fashion trends growing up. It's a game for regular folks who know how to have a good time!"
3,Not as good as catch phrase,"When I bought this game - I was hoping it would be a fun drinking game, but the only problem is it is really hard to play. We took the game and made our own ""version"" of how you should play and still haven't taken the time to figure out how you really play. There are so many games out there, if I had gotten this at a store - I would have returned it. Too much of a pain to do it via mail."
5,Love it!,"This game is a lot of fun. We actually prefer this game to cranium now! We really liked how it didn't have a gameboard. You get chips for points and once you get 21 you win. It's neat how you can pick what category you want to perform for your card. A lot of fun, I'd recommend it!"
4,Great... with only one flaw!,"This game is a great one! Me and my friends are in love with it (we range in ages from 22-46). Men vs. women, brothers vs. sisters... its fun no matter what.For the parents with young kids out there, I wouldnt reccomend it for them; many of the things on the cards will not be good for younger children (not because they are inapporpriate, but because the things on the cards just contain info they wouldn't know about -- for example 80's rock bands.-- But for you and your friends... Oh yeah I would! :)My only problem with this game is that they dont give you enough cards. I could really use a booster pack. (You hear that Cranium!?!?!?!)"
5,"""Game Lovers Love This Game""","Everyone in my family from the ages of 10 to 50 loved this game. It was easy for kids to play, and quite fun. I think the only problem is the ""clay"", but only because of the fact that it may harden over time. But play-dough is an option if it does!"
2,Ritzer's Sociological Theory - Is it Worthwhile?,"Ritzer gives brief synoses of major theorists in this work. While his treatments are concise they are by no means complete. This study shoudl serve as a ""jumping off"" place for more in-depth studies on major theorists.While this study may satisfy the ""dabbler"" in sociology, it is not highly recommended for serious scholarly study."
1,product does not meet acceptable standards,"I bought this mirror to replace one damaged in an accident. The body shop installed it. When you drove down the road the image of the car behind you wiggled , the shop told me it was a terrible mirror and most aftermarket mirrors were bad.I was sent a replacement mirror, this one distorted the image of the car behind me, made the car wider than it really was. I bought a used mirror from a wrecking yard, problem solved. Just out of curiosity I weighed the K-Scource mirror 3# , the used one 3 3/4 # the original equipment had more & better things inside, that's why it works!Bottom line: don't waste your time & money on these aftermarket mirrors.Superb service from Amazon !"
2,Virginia cookbook,"Very disappointing. So many of the recipes call for things like Campbell's soups, etc. I was looking for an authentic Old Dominion cookbook but I did not get it. I'm still searching for one called 'Virginia Woman'. This one that I got was not at all what I was looking for. It appears to be just a bunch of recipes put together by a group of little wannabe Society girls looking for some attention. Too Bad.Carole MinorSt. Petersburg, FL"
4,Hymne a L'Amour tribute to Edith Piaff,This is a WONDERFUL tribute to Edith Piaf from one who knows her so well- She has gathered those connected with her while she was alive & each gives their emotional feeling when performing with Edith.
5,Excellent Resource,This is a great resource for the practitioner in training. It's easy to use and helps you learn in-take process and differential diagnosis tools.
5,awesome worship CD,"I recently got the Revival Generation CD, and it was mainly because I know one song we sing in church, and I wasn't sure if I'd like it. but I was TOTALLY amazed when I heard it! I love it! I recognized SO many of the songs. this CD is full of awesome worship, and it makes you want to dance and praise the Lord along with it! I recommend this to everyone!!"
2,Below expectaitons,"Significant water damage, in old, dusty and cracked jewel case. All not mentioned. Below expectations. But CD works without fault"
3,Good travelling resource but has serious indexing flaws,"This an excellent resource for the architecture student travelling across the USA; however, the second edition has so many incorrect index listings that the indices are practically useless. It's as if the second edition were released with the first edition index (although I haven't done an actual check). Wait for a third edition or plan to go through and amend the index with correct referent page numbers."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"I WOULD GIVE THIS WORTHLESS CD A MINUS TEN, BUT THAT IS NOT ON THE LIST. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WHAT THIS ""LOVE CD"" CONTAINS:1. ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF ""WHY YOU SHOULD NOT SMOKE"" (WHICH IS NOT IN THE LEAST INVENTIVE IN DELIVERY IN LANGUAGE, OR IS IT WELL WRITTEN)2. THE ""REST"" OF THE CD IS ""WAVES"" OR BAD ""MUSIC""--AND THAT IS IT! WHEN I AHD THE DISPLEASURE (AND IT WAS DEPRESSING AS YOU EXPECT SOMETHING FOR YOUR MONEY!)-- I WAS LISTENING TO THE CD TO THE ""OCEAN WAVES"" (TOTALLY UNSURE OF HOW THESE SO-CALLED PROFESSIONALS THINK WILL HELP PEOPLE WITH SMOKING)--AND FINALLY REALIZED--THAT IS ALL THE CD IS.HORRIBLE PRODUCT.I ORDER FROM AMAZON ALL THE TIME, AND I THINK IN 15 OR SO YEARS, THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE EVER WRITTEN--BUT THIS CD IS LESS THAN WORTHLESS, IF THAT IS POSSIBLE."
4,"Good, straight ahead (I hate that term) blowing.","This didn't get much attention in the barrage of releases, but I think it's a fine outing. Sherman has a definite signature on the alto sax, which I think is one mark of any true artist. I buy tons of Jazz discs, and I'm still playing this one after all this time."
4,Treat yourself,"Bath fizzies seem to be a dime a dozen these days, but this particular one sets itself apart from the rest in my opinion. Too many other bath fizzies look great in the packaging, but when you use them, they turn the bathwater unappealing colors and/or have so many oils they make it a hazard to attempt climbing out of the tub.Neither is the case with this product. It turns the bathwater a vibrant deep blue. The scent is nice without being overpowering and it moisturizes well without creating a slipping hazard on the tub surface."
3,Too Small for a 6lb Chihuahua,"This is advertised as being for animals up to 8lbs. My dog is 6lbs and this bag is WAY too small for him. The quality in nice however, so I'm going to try the medium instead."
3,Limes,"The limes were not what I had expected. They were much smaller than I thought, but I found a use for them nonetheless. They did arrive in a timely fashion."
3,Modern India,This title is a bit misleading; it is a great history of India from a first person perspective when it starts. I am loving it!
3,"Well, modern for the 19th Century anyway","This is an extended observation on India and its people from the prospective of the 19th Century raj. It is an interesting historical document with a lot of insights -- as well as a lot of Eurocentric racist nonsense. It's worth reading not just for the historical information, but for the perspective it gives on how one ""enlightened"" Englishman viewed India and its people at the time."
2,Out of sync,"I second the comment of the reviewer that said that the video and sound are out of sync. I've loved this show on tape/CD for many years, and was looking forward to seeing the DVD, but watching the misaligned version of Stella Blue was very disappointing. I have stuck the DVD on the shelf, and am going back to my CDs."
4,"Great show, only OK production","This is a great DVD, and a lot of the reviews here really point out all that is great with this show. So, what's not (beside the special effects stuff)? Two things. One, frequently through the DVD the soundtrack and the video are significantly out of sync. This is really a disappointment on a vocal closeup or watching the fingerwork on a solo. Second, a produced 5.1 mix would have been very nice. Yes, I know there was originally only 2 channels, but you can produce some very good effect in post-production. At least put two (or three) audio versions on the disk and let people pick. The way my (and many I would guess) home theater is set up, the two little left and right satellites are there for movie directional fill, and really don't do the soundtrack justice when in two channel mode. Yeah, yeah, I know - I need to go buy those towers instead ;)"
3,NOT THE SAME WITHOUT BRENT,"The Grateful Dead were never the same when the great Brent Mydland passed away. The band never were in sinc especially when Vince and at times Bruce Hornsby joined the band. They were still a good band at that time to go see and party up at the same time, but musically speaking BRENT along with a good Garcia made the show. Anything thing from the early eighties up until Brents death is worth watching or of course listening too. sorry."
1,Not at all happy!,"I wanted the drive spur that is shown in the photo. I wanted long, sharp spurs and long center pin. That's what is shown. The spur I received has short, nearly blunt spurs and a center pin that no longer than the spurs. As far as I'm concerned, it is useless. But, it arrived in a package with the same item number as shown, so I received the correct item. It just wasn't what is shown in the photo.It's to much hassle to send it back. I urge Amazon to put an accurate photo of the product on-line."
4,Does the job,Good medium size spur drive chuck. Center pin is depth adjustable. Blades are very sharp and the tool is hardened.
5,"Upbeat, fun music for an ocean unit!","We love our new CD. The lyrics are catchy and the students track along in song books, and are learning the words to many of the songs. The song quality is very good as well. The songs are strictly for entertainment, and do not offer any instructional lyrics that are related to the ocean theme."
4,Fun at bathtime!,"We love this CD at bathtime! All the ocean, fish, & water-related songs are a blast! My boys (ages 3 and 2) swim around and sing along. They know when they hear BEYOND THE SEA that it's time to wrap things up and dry off. A lot of fun music."
1,the littlest angel,"As previous reviewers have stated, this is horrible. I was really looking forward to this with the kids. It is in such bad taste, older mean jealous angels. a poor litle 4 yr old boy who apparently died and is scared and miserable and this is how he is greeted in Heaven. Ridiculous. Don't waste your money. I wish I listened to reviews and did not waste mine!!!"
2,This Ain't What Heaven Is...,If you believe Heaven is an idealistic edenic & beautiful plane of consciousness full of wonder and splendor - pass this movie by...
3,The Search for Jack London is a feast for readers.,"As a playwright and screenwriter, I'm especially fascinated by a novel that presents rich and exciting characters in a situation that's rife with mystery, passion and a compelling plot. Jerome Lofgren has managed to tweak this reader's imagination in a way that made it impossible for me to set the book aside, and equally impossible to read it only once. I predict this story will be given at least one more lifetime in motion picture houses around the world. Paul Roland, Ashland, Oregon."
4,Great but Gaudy,The watch was a fast delivery and in impressive shape. Beautifully handcrafted but the face was a lot larger than I thought it would be. Not for the modest man however worth the cost for those into a bit of excess.
4,Execelent excercise for go situation analysis,"This book is compact and high quality. First the book presents pattern and board situation where that pattern is present, then right and wrong choises in that pattern are analysed. After that one to three board situations are presented for reader to find the best move sequence. Common factor in these problems is that solution contains the presented pattern at some point. This kind of chapters are grouped together by the goal which is tried to reach. At the end of such group is collection of problems (8-12 roughly) in which the goal is fixed but solutions variably contain some of the patterns presented. Thus, this book contains a lot of problems to solve and explanation of ideas behind. For me this book has provided some ability to spot on board locations which need further consideration."
4,Will read again and again,"Presently playing at 11 kyu, I find a great deal of weakness in my own game when fighting, especially against stronger players. There is a great deal to absorb in this book, but I have found that recollection of some of the techniques has already helped me.I found many of the examples too difficult to solve currently, on my first read-through. However, I plan to re-read sections and gain strength.I suspect that a player at 20 kyu would find other concepts of more benefit for learning. Additionally, I would guess that a 5 kyu player will still derive a great deal of benefit, as they likely are not solid on each technique."
5,Greatest Documentary about the Bulge EVER!,"By far the greatest documentary about the Battle of the Bulge ever created. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Thorough, thoughtful, detailed and exciting. Remarkable archival footage and interviews with veterans of the campaign."
4,A Very Good Documentary,This show combines interviews with survivors and actual footage. It shows how US Intelligence was surprised by the Germans in this attack. It is very clear how the entire operation began and why it ended in victory for the allies.
5,VHS tape of Battle of the Bulge,"This purchase was of a used VHS tape recording. The item was immaculate, both the tape itself and its box, exactly as adverised. Delivery (standard shipping) was unexpectedly fast, due largely to the speedy response to my order."
2,A tale not well told,This is standard televison fare. The interviews are ordinary. The stock footage is mundane. And it is not supported with maps and graphics to further explain the sequence of the battle. This story is not well told. Read John Tolland's BATTLE: THE STORY OF THE BULGE and you will get a real telling of the Battle of the Bulge.
5,An Entertaining Movie,"If you are one who likes movies that follow in the vein of ""Fatal Attraction"" you will enjoy ""The Perfect Neigbor."" Overall, it is well written, produced and acted. I enjoy the movie and have viewed it more since I bought it. Only consider buying this movie you like movies like this to begin with. My overall rating of ""The Perfect Neighbor"" is a B."
1,Run From this !....Far as you can !,There is nothing sexy about this film at all ! Most straight to video releases a have a brick house babe ! Or lots of sex or nudity this is a waste of time. At least if the quality of the movies are going to be B it could offer something ! The people in this movie are all 50 years old ! I don't know what the director was thinking ! At least if you can't come up with a original idea you could bring some appeal to it ! Horrible movie a complete waste of time! I wanted all my time spent refunded !
5,A fine story in the Space Opera tradition,"I was a little worried at first as this was the fourth book in a series and I had not read the first three for background. It turns out that's not a problem in The Armies of Memory and the only times I got that ""Am I missing something?"" feeling was the early talk about Occitan and Ixism though they were well explained later in the story. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read with plenty of self depreciating humor about ""how guys think."" I was disappointed at one small loose end in that the question ""how did the note end up in Giraut's hand?"" did not get resolved. Though billed as the conclusion of the series Barnes did leave an opening to develop further on the fates of Giraut, Ixism, Thousand Cultures, and the Invaders."
3,Interesting Read,"Interesting read. Strange sort of immortality what with downloading copies of yourself.It ends but the war is looming, at least they know what they are up against and have begun to put their own house in order.It was original though the head eating enemy processing memory was just goofy. I kept thinking it would end up being a ruse by the AI's that came about from our own world."
2,Is this Sherlock Holmes?,"I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a kid and I have to say this is one of the worst Holmes films out there (even Matt Frewer's Holmes is better). I don't mind leaving canon behind for new and original stories, but completley reinventing the whole history just doesn't work. The only good thing about this film is the portrayal of Moriarity by Vincent D'onofrio. His Moriarity is as eccentric as Holmes is supposed to be. However, even with D'onofrio's performance I can't recommend this one."
5,"I LIKED THIS ONE, DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT GOT LOW RATINGS","I really liked this one of Holmes videos. I have a large collection and this one rates at the top of the list. The actors were excellent and I could understand the English accent. The story was easy to follow and made sense. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a young Holmes & Watson. The star of Law & Order, did his best work of his life on either TV or movies. This IS A GREAT BUY AND STORY. If you do like this one try the other Holmes with young actors."
2,Confused mess indeed (not the move but the DVD product),"I liked the movie; I have seen it on TV two years ago. But watch out. It may happen to you if you try order the same product from amazon.com. I have placed my order with an Amazon Merchant, and what happened. Instead of getting a brand new product, with following attributes (DVD Release Date: August 24, 2004; Closed-captioned, Widescreen, as it is stated), I got NO Closed-captioned, NO Widescreen product (DVD Release Date: 2003) in a shabby box. It was NOT in the original packing and it was NOT new but already used copy! I really felt cheated."
2,did moriarty make this one?!,"this isn't sherlock holmes! i managed to get twenty minutes into this thing and then i had to turn off. this is so incredibly off the mark it's ridiculous! worst ""holmes"" movie ever! i shall never say a bad word about matt frewer's eccentric kid oriented holmes again."
4,A New Sherlock !!!,"I watched many Sherlock Holmes movies and I thought this was a totally different movie than the ""standard"" Sherlock Holmes films. In this movie you see a young, kind of arrogant Holmes but the future relationship with Dr. Watson and his development into THE Sherlock Holmes are visible.I very much enjoyed this story and anybody who likes Sherlock Holmes will enjoy it too ! Give it a try ..."
4,The Ultimate Sherlock!,"Like the Ultimate Spiderman comic series which starts with the basics and redrafts it for a new audience so does Serlock: Case of Evil. It takes the basic elements and provides a new spin on Holmes as a good-looking, arrogant, publicity seeking Holmes who likes women.The movie looks great! Widescreen with a pounding score. This is the Holmes the BBC should have done as a man of action rather than the latest version of the Hound of the Baskervilles with Richard Roxborough. This movie in one way pays little fidelity to Holmes but captures another version that it Holmes were created today this is how he would be like. Its something akin to what we can expect from the new BBC series of Doctor Who in 2005."
3,Sherlock Gets Some,"A Study in Scarlet is thrown out and Sherlock is introduced anew in this stylish production. Things drag a bit in the middle portion, possibly because D'Onofrio's over-the-top but very convincingly malicious Moriarty is offstage. The picture's notable mainly for the famously misogynist Holmes bedding more women than James Bond ever did in a single film. (He even has a threesome.)"
1,So bad that it's a must see.,"Arguably the poorest Sherlock film ever. The only thing worse than a dreadfulscreenplay are the acting performances by the protagonists. James Darcy as Holmes and Vincent D'Onofrio as Professor Moriarty do not rise to the level of mediocrity. It is so bad, Holmes fans should add it to their dvd collection. Watching this bomb will make them appreciate other Sherlock films."
4,Africa's Bob Marley strikes again,"I remember purchasing ""Spirit of Love"" back in the 90's and making a point to monitor everything that Fashek does. He is every bit an African musician, but has been heavily influenced by Bob Marley and brings an American edge to some of the numbers as well (perhaps the producing by Miami Steve Van Zandt on Spirit of Love rubbed off a bit). If you like westernized African music or a classic reggae album with a bit more variety than you are used to, then this is a great album. This ranks right up there with the best of Majek Fashek, IMO."
2,cute but not functional,"I bought this product because it was cute and cheap. Well, I got it for what I wanted it for. It is cute and it definitely is cheap. My daugter still uses it, but the fabric has ripped in several places. She doesn't put very heavy items in it, but it suits for right now. Looking back I probably would've gotten a more sturdy toy chest."
3,NOTE: This is a MODERN Greek Version,"Students (and other potential purchasers) should be aware that this is a MODERN Greek edition, and NOT the original Greek New Testament. If that is what you are looking for, this is a nice compact and inexpensive version. However, if your interest is in New Testament (or koine) Greek, this is not what you need."
3,"Not as good as some, but for five bucks...","What Greek student can pass up the chance for a brand new Greek New Testament text for just five or six dollars. Nothing fancy in this text, but with a Greek background or a good help book, this text is great!"
1,Poppycock,"Complete poppycock. I guess how well you like this book (or the whole topic for that matter) depends on what you are prepared to believe. At least now, I know to avoid wasting any more time on the subject."
5,Metric/Standard Tape Measure,Good sound product. Built to last. Easy to read. Stores and travels easily. Used as measuring tape for Special Olympics competition and performed flawlessly.
1,"Amazon, are you kidding me?",Tamar Davis debut album is hard to find and this how much it cost to pay for a rare album! This is like putting down for a car note! I seen several albums that anywhere from $25-$200 but this is a slap in the face for a person like me of wanting this album for my personal collection. Can you please lower the price down to at least $25.Thank you
4,Excellent basic turning set,"I bought this set to replace the tools when I sold my Shopsmith. I have lathe chisels made by Sorby, Henry Taylor, Woodcraft, and Delta. I use the Delta for the majority of my turnings, mainly pens. These are High Speed Steel tools with excellent handles. I sharpen them on a Delta vertical water cooled sharpener. They hold their edge as well as any of the others. They are definately NOT Carbon Steel as the previous reviewer claims. I have been very pleased with these tools and would recommend them to anyone doing spindle turning."
4,Decent starter set,"I got these free with the purchase of a Delta lathe. While they are certainly not professional quality they are a deal at the price of...FREE! Reading the previous review regarding the ""bluing"" of the tools; he must have gotten a bad set or is pushing the tool too hard. Mine are nice and sharp, I have yet to have one ""blue"" at the tip. I especially liked the nice case they come in, that was an unexpected bonus."
4,Knowing the Plan of Attack Before the Germans Attacked! The Ultra Secret.,"The book describes, with historical context, how the Allies in WWII broke the secret codes of the German High Command. The OKH/German High Command used an encryption device to encode all communications to all military units. The book actually describes how the Allied command actually knew when the Germans were going to attack, who the lead units would be, how they would attack, even the phase line, supply and equipment disposition, battle status, and the like battlefield communications. Even having that type of foreknowledge the Germans were still able to beat the allies. I recommend the book to all those who really want to understand how the Allies actually used the Ultra Secret to achieve supreme allied victory. Without this book a military student will miss one of the most strategic and most secret intelligence of all of WWII."
3,Not a page turner for me,The author tells about an epic time in history but with little dramatic impact. Some maps would have helped me follow the story. Perhaps the fact that the book was written in a foreign language (English) made it a bit cumbersome for an American.
2,Ultra Smug,"An intriguing account of how Winterbotham single-handedly made the planet safe for democracy during WWII. One is left with the impression that the great generals and admirals may have had an ace up their sleeves, but also with the impression that Winterbotham is in love with himself. Despite his shameless name-dropping and self-aggrandizement, this book is a must-read for any serious student of WWII, because of the important context it provides for events of that time."
3,Didn't work fo rme,We have a kitchen radio where several AM stations contain a lot of static. This despite us being in a good location (on a hill with the radio towers visible). I figured I would try this. It made no difference. I suspect there's some sort of interference or that some of our aluminum siding (on part of the house) is causing the problem. The radio also has no antenna connector -- just the built-in antenna -- which limits my options. I returned this since it didn't work for me. The return process with Amazon was painless.
1,Terk Tech AM-1000 Antenna,Tried this antenna in two different locations 30 miles apart; it did not help at all with AM reception using two different radios.
1,Great Anticipation Ends Up in Great Disappointment,"After months of trying to pull in some strong non-fading AM stations on my clock radio at night, I thought this antenna would provide the solution. Sadly, I was wrong. While the Terk AM-1000 Advantage does look quite impressive and well built, I would say it makes a better decoration (or dust collector) than a radio antenna. I would NOT recommend it."
1,does not work for me,Product does not work for me at all.With the long wait for the item and the price bad news for me.
1,Don't expect this to work with a Bose Wave Radio,Bose recommends this antenna for their very expensive Wave radios which do NOT have external connectors for AM antennas. They say to set the device alongside the radio and turn it in various directions to improve reception. Don't believe them. I found no improvement even tho I suspect the antenna itself probably works just fine. Shame on Bose.
1,Warning - Do Not Buy -It does Not work,"Hopefully, if you buy this device you live at the foot of a broadcast tower, otherwise you will be out of luck. We tried every trick in the instructions to no avail. Do not waste your time with this unit or its sister. I presume all of the ""good"" reviews come from employees of the company or are the investors. This item should only be sold by Popular Mechanics or other rags that promote useless tools."
4,An Ancient Idea that Works,"Length:: 0:51 MinsAn ancient idea, from 80 years ago. It helps improve AM only reception primarily in the daytime.Tips:-use during the day-works best with ""average"" home radios, not for car or high quality radios-for best results: a) it must be turned by hand to face the station transmitter, and b) it must be tuned by hand to the same dial position as the shown on this radioSo this means, you must tune twice for best results.Summary: this is quite techy, but useful if you want improved daytime reception from a weak AM station."
5,Terk AM-1000 Antenna,"I read about the Terk in Monitoring Times magazine and decided it was worth a try, although I really didn't expect stellar results; I figured that better AM reception was worth a try since almost everything I listen to is on the AM Band. It was reasonably priced and seemed like it should work.Upon the opening the box, the first thing I noticed was how well it was made. I felt solid, like whovever designed it expected it to work as advertised. Then I read the instructions, which are almost pointless because the antenna is so easy to use. Then I put it next to my radio, rotated it until the signal improved, tuned the dial on the antenna to zero the signal and sat back amazed that it had actually improved my reception significantly. It made poor signals good and good singals great.If better AM reception is your goal, the Terk will get you there."
5,Eliminates Static and Hiss,"The Terk Advantage has been a miracle for me. Living in an apartment building in an urban center with lots of hills, I never had clear reception before. Even expensive, high-end component tuners and upscale radios did not work well. I was sceptical when I ordered the Terk after reading so many rave reviews. Now I am in total awe at the improvement this antenna has made, and I am ready to order another one for a different room. I am using it with a GE SuperRadio III, and could not be happier."
2,Quite Disapointed,"I recently purchasd the Terk AM-1000 to use with my GE SuperRadio 3. When I received the terk, I attached the antenna leads directly the antenna and ground points on the radio. I was expecting a noticable improvemment. What I got was a very minimal improvement. My favorite station still fades in and out like before, although it does seem to be a bit better. Would I recommend that you purchase this product? Not really, as I don't think it was worth the investment."
2,Didn't work for my radio.,Bought this in 12/2011 from Amazon. Bought it to improve AM reception for my Sangean WR2 radio that i use in a 2 story office building. The WR2 would only get 3-4 AM stations and they were all staticky. I am in a corner office with large windows. I screwed wire to back of radio and set antenna on window ledge. Didn't improve reception that good. Was able to get maybe 2-3 more stations but still all stations came in staticky. Maybe it will work in your building or home but not good for my location/use so i returned it.
3,Helps some,I've been using the Terk with a couple of Sangean and one Grundig radio. Sometimes it helps reception and sometimes it seems to make no difference.
4,Interesting AM solution,"The unit works fairly well at pulling a weak station, better than I expected, but not perfectly for my puposes."
4,Good Distance Antenna for AM and HD,"I selected this antenna based on the Amazon reviews, and I am quite satisfied with it. The antenna is well made and works well to bring in stations which were marginal. Distance reception is at best, variable, of course."
1,AM-1000 Did Not Improve Reception,"The Terk AM-1000 did not work. I am able to get the station in the car radio, but not in the house. It made no improment to the receptions. I had to return the product."
1,Useless,"Simply does not work as described. Tried on two different radios in two different cities and there was no noticeable improvement in reception. Yes, I read the directions carefully and moved it around to every conceivable position and used the built-in tuner, but didn't really help any. Very disappointing. I ended up returning it."
1,Not what I expected.,"Instead of clearing up AM broadcasts, it just increased the static. I returned the product."
2,Waste,"Didn't improve a thing, a total waste of money. Was hoping it would take away some of the static but was useless"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Plain and simple, this item doesn't work. Honestly, it made absolutely no difference in radio reception in my home, even after following all their suggestions. Junk."
2,Doesn't work!,"This item doesn't work in my area. I live in northern Nevada (Carson City) and have only one AM station in my area. This unit doesn't even have any effect on my radio's reception of that station. I can pickup some nearby other states (cities), i.e. Denver, SaltLake, Seattle and even San Diego, AM station brodcasts when the atmospherics are good but the unit has absolutly no effect on their reception. When I pickup a remote station and try tuning with the tuning capacitor nothing seems to change.I think it's my location and not the unit. However if anyone else purchases it they should be quick to try it and if it doesn't work send it back within the return period!!My radio is a CC Crane and is amoung the best at AM reception so it's not the radio.This unit is the second of it's type that I have tried and none work. So I will stop trying."
2,Does NOT enhance AM signals at night!,"Boy, am I dissapointed.I just purchased this antenna and wired it up as directed to my brand-new Yamaha stereo tuner. The TERK-1000 is tunable and enhances the AM signal during the daytime, but nightime is another story.I know AM signals attenuate and degrade at night, but I expected this antenna, with its ability to tune for a best signal and incorporating the latest technology, to also enhance the AM stations at night.Forget it. They STILL snap, crackle, pop, hiss, and fade in and out despite the TERK-1000 firmly attached. Apparently, it is an unrepairable characteristic of AM signals that they become garbage at night, and NO antenna will help you with that, even this good-looking, tunable home AM antenna.If you listen to AM in the daytime then you can use this antenna. It works well during daylight hours. But if you expect it to improve AM reception at night, ain't gonna happen per my experience.Buy it for daylight use, save your money for evening listening."
3,Mixed results,"Bought the Terk Advantage 1000 with hopes it would perform better than the little 4"" X 5"" loop that came with my Sangean HD Radio tuner. It doesn't seem to help in the daytime, but at night makes enough difference to note. Tried both air-coupled and directly connected to the ant terminals. The Terk made little or no difference during the day but at night when the stations I want to listen to reduce power the signal strength will increase several counts when I place the Terk next to the factory loop. Unfortunately I still get unreliable daytime HD reception with occasional dropouts of the HD signal. Tuning of the Terk is critical. Too bad they did not incorporate gear reduction vernier tuning. Hopefully when the broadcasters finally start transmitting HD-AM at night the Terk will provide enough signal to make it work. I am in the DFW area and the AM stations I want to listen to are all local."
3,AM Antenna,I bought this antenna for my office radio that has terrible reception for AM stations. It didn't help to any noticable degree so I returned the product & my account was promptly credited plus shipping. Thanks Amazon.
1,didn't work,I have an AM station that I like and get real clear in my car but not in my house. I bought this and it did not work on my home receiver which is about 20 feet from where I can get a clear signal in my car.
1,Didn't work for me.,I purchased a Sharp office stereo and needed something to bring in AM stations. My office is in the basement of my home so not ideal. I am also about 40 miles from major city for stations. The Terk ADAVANTAGE provided no improvement in AM reception. I returned for refund and am looking for something that works (maybe amplified.)
3,Not sure how to rate this,This did not work for me. I could not get it far enough away from my TV which was causing interference. Not really Terk's fault.
1,Terk Indoor AM antenna,"I was told by ""Bose Radio"" that this product might improve my AMradio reception. It didn't do anything to remove the static and poor reception and was a real waste of money."
1,Lousy,"I bought this after getting the CCRadio-EP AM/FM Radio, it didn't imrove it one bit. not happy at all. Would never buy again"
2,Disappointed,"I had such high hopes that this product would help me to get WBZ-1030AM out of Boston. We live on Lake Champlain north of Burl, VT and it is one of the truly enjoyable stations (except for Public Radio) that I enjoy on a sleepless night.I felt so confident that this would be the answer and aid my new CC Crane - it has not helped. Should have returned it but it is 8 months old so guess it will be sent to Salvation Army."
1,Do not waste your time or money,I tried using this on several different radios. I did not get an improved reception on any of them.
1,Very poor performance,"I bought a terk antenna to try to boost the AM reception of my long range radios, which I use in the UK to get medium wave from the Irish broadcaster RTE. (I have both the CC Radio plus and the GE Superadio). The Terk antenna makes absolutely no difference to the GE Superadio and actually disimproves the Sangean CC Radio. It does not do what it says it should at all. I would not recommend you bother with it. Just get a long wire and hang it out the window of your house and you might do better. PS - in my experience in the UK, the GE Superadio completely outstrips the Sangean radio for station reception - it doesn't have the sleek looks or the digital tuning, but if it's reception you want, get a GE radio."
3,Just ok,"Was told by Bose that this antenna would improve my AM reception on my Bose Wave radio. It did not, but I think to be fair it is the poor design of the Bose Wave. DO NOT BUY BOSE WAVE IF WANT TO LISTEN TO ANY, ANY AM RADIO. Their product is terrible and they will send you on a wild goose chase buying antenna after antenna that they claim will solve your problem. Bose used to be good, they are terrible now."
1,"Unimpressed Massively, I am","Wanted the critter to function. Longed for decent AM reception. Sadly, despite use with several radios, including a GE SuperRadio, I could detect NO improvement with reception.Nebraska, Missouri and California... used in each state with the same results.Portable radios, large shelf receivers, separate tuners... the Terk did nothing for me.Hooked it up two different ways with no luck.Fiddled about, fiddled about, fiddle... fiddle. fiddle... with the Terk's passive tuner knob and though it helped make a station be heard better the improvement was no better than reception obtained when the Terk was not attached or in close proximity.Me wonders if those lauding the device are not deluding themselves in some way due to my years of use at several venues with nary any success in AM broadcast reception improvement."
1,"After 6 weeks, I still have not received this product.","Today's date is Dec 5, 2007. I ordered the ""Terk Technology AM-1000 Advantage Passive AM Indoor Antenna"" on Oct 25, 2007. Seems like a long time to me. Mike"
1,Didn't cost much and got what I paid for.,I wish this item worked as well as the service/delivery from Amazon. Have had this about a month now and really can't see that it does much of anything. As it is tuned across the dial there is a VERY slight change in signal but almost inaudible. Not recommended!
1,Didn't work at all,"Had hoped that this item with its generally positive reviews would solve my elderly mother-in-law's AM weak reception problem on one particular station that she listens to for hours each day, but it did ABSOLUTELY nothing. ZERO! Already had moved her radio to a more advantageous position in regards to the station's signal. Tried all kinds of positioning, two different high quality radios, and numerous tuning adjustments to no avail. Re-read the directions several times to be sure that I didn't miss anything."
5,A helpful antenna.,"I wanted to listen to an AM station at work. None of the radios I brought in would pick it up until I bought the Tivoli Model 1. It worked well, but the reception could still be pretty fuzzy at times. A year late I bought the Terk AM Advantage, sat it on top of the Tivoli, and my favorite station came in crystal clear!The Tivoli already had really good AM reception, but the Terk really made listening enjoyable.I think the Terk would show more of an improvement on a lesser am radio."
2,Terk Passive Antenna,"The antenna is made pretty well, but it does not make much difference in most cases I've found. You have tune it for every station which is very difficult because you have to not only position the antenna correctly but also manually turn a control. The difference is just not worth the effort and mine is collecting dust on the counter. Walk away from this one!"
4,Wow - It works!,"What else is there to say? It works great too! I couldn't stand listening to all the static on my expensive stereo system when I listened to AM. I hooked up the Terk AM 1000, dialed in the frequency to WLS (talk radio), and I have never heard it sound this good. Actually I first bought the Terk FM Pro 50, but I had my doubts. I had no doubts after I hooked it up so I ordered the AM 1000 as well. Where can I get paid for this???? I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like having to dial in to the station I listen to for best reception. I only listen to WLS talk radio on AM so it is really no bother to me."
3,terk am antenna,"Didn't notice any change in the signals I was trying to receive. My radios, eton 5, st909, and super radio, continued to operate the same on distant stations."
2,Waste of Money,"This was purchased to try to receive a descent AM signal on a Bose radio system. We tried the recommended position for the antenna with respect to the radio and then moved it every way we could conceive and still got marginal, if any improvement. Adjusting the antenna dial to duplicate the radio frequency brought no noticeable improvement. A waste of money, not only for the antenna, but also for the Bose radio. We can get great FM reception but my wife likes some AM talk radio and that quickly becomes frustrating."
1,Doesn't work,"This device not only did not perform, but to return it I had to pay shipping both ways. This,in effect, cost me half of the purchase price with nothing to show"
1,Did not help at all,"Terk has a great reputation. I read the reviews, and even Bose recommended this item. However, it made zero difference for me. On the Wave Radio, at least my model, there is no way to connect this amplified antenna to the radio for better AM reception. It has to be used in wireless mode. It did not help at all. I'll just have to tolerate static and fuzzy reception."
1,save your money,i played with it for a while with different radios and it had little to no impact on reception. i would say simply save your money.
2,didn't work for us,"It didn't work for us. The radio station we wanted to get in didn't get any better than with the antenna sent with the receiver. However, a different station that we don't listen to does come in better."
3,Dr. Maelstrom & Sara Bellum,"There are not any special features on this disc, with the exceptions of language, et cetera.There are 4 episodes, and they are probably the least interesting in the whole series, especially the parts with Dr. Maelstrom. They drag this on for three whole episodes; while looking into Carmen's past is good, Dr. Maelstrom coming back could have been plotted better.The final episode (a bonus), is a bit more interesting, but not by much. When it Rains show lets you know more about Sara Bellum, Carmen's gadget girl. The plot is twisted, but the ending is ingenious.Overall, When it Rains saves the DVD from a flat-out 0, but overall you do not miss to much if you are as not to buy the DVD."
1,SAME Practice tests as found in ARCO's Special Agent Deputy U.S. Marshal by Eve STEINBERG (10th edition),"This brand new edition by MORGAN has the same two practice exams as the 2000 ARCO's Special Agent Deputy U.S. Marshal by Eve STEINBERG (10th edition) Do not be fooled by the 2006 ""new"" edition, different ""author"" or title. Were it not for the preview pages of the table of contents, one would have been fooled in thinking that there are THREE practice tests, when in fact there are only two full OLD practice tests from 2000. Its so-called third practice test is not another TEA practice test, but a descriptive self-inventory, which was already included in the Steinberg 10th edition. If you are thinking of buying this to get new practice tests, don't waste your money. A rearrangement of questions, and elimination of some information does not justify this edition under a new name and author. Don't waste your money."
3,"Exact same questions, different study guide","I've thoroughly read the ARCO 10th edition, TEA study guide, and it has the exact same questions for all three parts of the study guide as this recent 11th edition release. This new study guide has simply just placed the questions into a different format. i.e. The diagnostic arithmatic test section (11th edition) just simply combines all of the questions from the various math skill sections from the 10th edition guide. I noticed not a single new question for the verbal reasoning and investigative sections either. The 10th edition even gives you good info on the Treasury training school in Maryland that the 11th doesn't. Maybe the actual TEA hasn't changed since the 10th edition release. If you liked the 10th edition, why spend your money on this new guide?"
1,dont waste your money,"Im a college educated law enforcement officer, I was always a decent but far from spectacular student, these study guides are totally uncessesary. I never looked at a single study guide or studied at all period. I havent taken a math class in about 10 years. I took the TEA exam and passed it. The math is the hardest part and the study guide wont help you much for that. dont waste your money on these study guides. If you are a decent critical thinker you will do fine on the test."
4,MUST HAVE BOOK TO REVIEW FOR THE EXAM!!!!!,"Unfortunately, I purchased this book way to late!!! If you are bad with math...this is the book for you, it has many of the same questions as in the test. The reading part is also the same! It's great!!! I recommend it 100%. I still do not know if I passed but trust me you need this book!Good luck to all!!"
3,Unexpected performance hiatus,"I installed one of these units in October 2007. After nearly four years of functioning quite well, the timer began malfunctioning. It no longer responded to the up or down arrows when attempting to set the clock, nor did it permit the on/off times to be reset. It did still turn the light on and off in manual mode.A week later, just before getting ready to install a replacement, I tried to change the time again. This time, both buttons of the time advance worked. I left the existing switch in place, and am keeping the replacement as a spare in case this event repeats itself. No explanation yet as to why the time up/down buttons were unresponsive nor why they started working again.Up until the timer buttons had that hiatus, I'd have rated this switch higher. However, having had mechanical timers perform solidly for twice as long, it was disappointing to see a problem of this type."
3,wall timer cfl compatible,Product works as advertised. I needed something that would work with CFLs. Programming is easy and instructions are direct. The digital readout is easy to read and the face mounts flush with the wall plate. The product would get 5 stars instead of the 3 assigned because the wiring to this unit comes out of the right-hand side instead of the back. This makes installation very tight and one has to bend the wires hard to fit in a single gang box or if this switch occupies the right-most position in a multi gang box.I was working with a three gang box and had to move the other switches around so this switch occupied the extreme left position.I would buy it again and also recommend it but wish Swylite would change the wiring entry configuration.
5,Works Well,"Easy to install, program and operate. It does exactly as product description states. Of course, I have only had it installed for less than a week, so time will tell if it actually lives up to long term expectations. But so far, so good."
5,Simply Great!,What a great timer switch. I had been toiling with a competing brand for years. Finally I was fed up with the malfunctions and purchased this unit. What a relief. So easy to use and dependable. Buy it!
5,Works great.,"I installed one of these in July, 2006 (about a year ago now), and I have been extremely pleased with the results.It has been very reliable, and has worked flawlessly with my outdoor lighting. As a plus, it looks great. I use it with traditional CFLs.It was very easy to install. However, if you have a tight switch box, it will take some pushing and juggling, as it is physically bigger than a three-way switch. However, since the LST100 was my replacement for a non-CFL-compatable wall timer, it was just a drop-in for me."
3,Sorry to return this one! Bracelet a little long for me,"This bracelet seemed a little long for me and was actually a little more than 7"" - I need a 7"" bracelet tops. It was very pretty and the width of the link was great. I was sorry to send it back but the company was very good about giving me a credit. If you like a 7 1/4"" bracelet, you may like this one."
5,True quality video from a great director,"Michel Gondry is an abstract thinker with cutting edged creativity. From his childish ""Human Behavior"" video with Bjork, to his mature and dark ""Dead Leaves and Dirty Ground"" with the White Stripes. Gondry's creations are but a slice of his colorful and creative life. This DVD comes with a book and a postcard. The book includes the inside stories, sketches and photos of Gondry with the likes of Cibo Matto, the Rolling Stones and Bjork. Included in the book are pictures of his son(who is a smaller version of Gondry), brother and various cars his father owned. Missing from the book are the stories behind Massive Attack's ""Protection"" and Cibo Matto's ""Sugar Water"". But, with all that aside, Gondry's video is excellent and full of memorable vids, thoughts and ideas.In the future I hope to see this series of Director's DVD's expand with the likes of Mark Romaneck and Flora Sisgmondi."
5,"Best music videos, all from the same director","Like many other customers I didn't know before that so many of my favourite video clips came from the same director. Wheh I saw Bjork's ""Human Behavior"", Sinead O'Connor's ""Fire on Babylon"" and Radiohead's ""Knives Out"" the first time is was simply a shock of how good musical video can be!Now Gondry's works are available on this DVD. An excellent purchase; highly recommended.One big regret - no ""Fire on Babylon"" here. That clip sets the bar very high for the music visualization and deserved to be on any ""Best of""."
5,feed back on this dvd,this DVD rocks!!! michel gondry for president!!!! the entire collection is an amazing experience. any true music fan MUST get these DVD's (Chris Cuhnningham and Spike Jonze too).
3,It's a LOT of candy,"Gondry has created some great videos, along with with suffocatingly cute unbearably whimsical work. Happily, his early work is the most cloying; he has definitely improved with age. This dvd has some astonishing moments of genius: ""Sugar Water"" by Cibo Matto is particularly impressive.Watch in reverse chronological order: stop when you can't take any more cutesiness."
4,Excellent except for....,It would have been great if it included Gondry's video forStardust's Music Sounds Better Without You..but I guess they couldn't get the rights. I could also have done without thescatological One Day with the annoying unfunny David Cross (although the role is appropriate for him)..it's more like something the vastly overrated Jonze would do..
1,NO RADIOHEAD VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this DVD as much as the next guy, but damn, where is the KNIVES OUT video???????!!!!!!!!!???????? That video is crazy and would be great in DVD quality. All the other videos are great too, but the missing one bums me out. In trailers for this DVD, it said it would have the radiohead viddy in it. WTF?!?!?! The Chris Cunningham DVD is missing a few viddys that look cool too, but i guess, where omitted for some stupid arse reason. LAME ARSE!"
4,Oh yeah and also..,it would've been nice to have Terence Trent D'Arby's She Kissed Me video in place of a Bjork video..she has her own compilations..though it is nice to have all of her clips withGondry to compare and contrast
3,Michel Gondry,"This is a great compilation of his work. I am not a fan of Bjork at all and there are about 5 or 6 of her music videos on this DVD. There are also a few French performers on there. Even though I can't understand what they are saying, the videos are still done well."
2,Oh...my...GOD...,"Although I used to like the show ""Lizzie McGuire"", I lost interest the minute she entered the music business. Her ego was boosted way too much, she pretended to act all punk-ish (""Tell Me a Story"" music video), and she had no talent whatsoever.Not only is voice computerized, but she is accompanied by a huge amount of background singers who are like, 40 years old. They need to get a life and do something productive, rather than waste their time singing back-up for a no-talented flop.Even with the heavy backup and computerized voice, she stills sounds horrible, and surprisingly really young. If you didn't know she was 15, by listening to her music you'd guess she was 10 or 11. Even though her acting skills are by no means amazing, she should stick to doing that. Going into the music business was a HUGE mistake."
2,Hilary Needs to Stick To Acting,"Now don't get me wrong. Hilary can sing better than Britney Spears, but her acting outshines her singing. I listen to the CD on Radio Disney (they played the whole CD on the radio) and I glad I didn't buy it, cause it wasn't great. Half of her songs were so-so, and the others were all awful. Hilary Duff has upcoming projects, both singing and acting, and this person right here is only going to be interested in her movies and TV shows. I don't plan on purchasing her CD, and nor should you."
4,A stocking stuffer,"If anyone in your family is a Lizzie McGuire fan, or for that matter, if you have any girls under 12 on your gift list, this would probably be a hot item to get this year.Heavily engineered, maybe for good reason, this album is packed with bouncy Christmas songs, geared towards a younger audience. If you're looking for a crooning Bing Crosby or a regimental Mormon Tabernacle Choir - this one is NOT for you.Make a tween happy this Christmas and get her this upbeat, fun, dance-ready CD. You may even get the dishes done in gratitude -maybe.If Disney-generated mass market pop is not your thing, put a nice toasty pair of earmuffs on your own list.Amanda Richards, November 13, 2004"
4,"""Santa Claus Lane"" is a cool CD =)","I bought this CD after I heard the song ""Santa Claus Lane"" on the Disney Channel. This is a very cute CD and Hilary Duff is a really good singer. She should definitly do more albums in the future. Rock on Hilary!Oh, and check out her show on Disney called ""Lizzie McGuire""! The soundtrack rocks too!I highly recommend both CD's..."
3,Take a breath,"Calm down trashing Hil people. How many other mediocre singers have done REALLY BAD Christmas albums? This is run of the mill at least. I frankly think she HAS a voice which she uses on her album but they told her to go bubblegum for this. If nothing else, the arrangement on the Paul McCartney song is worth it. The original makes me feel like I 'm trapped in synthesizer purgatory. It's just background music to trim the tree by. She is hitting her market and that's the goal. I just hope it doesnt teach my daughter to sing thru her nose. (The cover is scary tho, I agree to that)"
1,Tell Me a Story.....,About how sucky this was.Listen to the classics. This is sugar-coated stuff not suitable for those out of preschool.
1,Yep...hil better stik 2 acting!,"Seriously! I heard ""I cant wait"" and it was okay but I heard Santa Clause Lane and she cannot sing. I luv LIzie McGuire! She tried singing and it doesnt work so....yeah. I wouldnt buy it either unless u think she actually sings good!"
1,Thank God I'm Jewish!,"You poor gentiles. So this is the kind of stuff you listen to at Christmas?FEH! I'd rather listen to those barking dogs singing ""Jingle Bells"".If I wasn't born a Jew this caterwauling would have made me convert."
4,Cute idea - Cute girl,"Santa bought this cd for a present - it is a cute cd with one exception. I would have rated it 5 stars if it wouldn't for the Lil' Romeo cameo - I am not a fan of rap - and I was disappointed that Hillary lowered herself to that level. It was a really cheap way of telling the Best Story Ever Told. She has a great voice for her series - why couldn't this have been used? Other than that the cd is great and for it to be bubble gum pop as another viewer rated, I thought it just right for this age. Our daughter skips the one track to get to the best parts."
3,"Hilary Duff can sing, but should stick to ""Lizze.""","This was okay, but I was disappointed. Hilary doesn't have a good voice. She can sing okay, but she can't match up to today's hit singers, like Kelly Clarkson, Vanessa Calton, and Michelle Branch. Hilary Duff should stick to ""Lizze McGurie."" Now acting is something Hliary can do very, very, very well."
2,Stick to Acting,"I love Lizzie McGuire, but I hate how Disney thinks they can make anyone a singer after being an actor. Hilary Duff is a cute actress, but thats about it. There is nothing new with her voice, and it is basically the same bubble gum pop around today (which sells-- and thats all Disney cares about). I think Hilary is better off with the acting career."
1,You call this music!?,"I didnt buy this CD, but I decided to listen to the samples on amazon... and i couldnt even listen to the whole sample! That's how horrific this CD is! Hilary can't sing, she should just act (not like she's great at that either) Booo to Hilary! lol"
2,am i the only one with ears?,"She is very cute, and I love Lizzie McGuire, but she can NOT sing! And I don't think she should be compared to Mandy Moore, because Mandy unlike Hilary actually has singing talent. I'm sorry but I'd say stick to acting."
2,Credit for the effort,"A nice try for Hilary Duff. Her voice sounds like it is mostly computer generated and she sings out of her nose too much. She should have picked different songs, more classics. I expect that she will get washed up in a matter of years. I will give her credit for her effort though but in my opinion she should stick to acting."
1,That's it! The world's coming to an end!!,"How long do we have to put up with this? Are we still going to hear her sing when she's like, forty? Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard it makes my ears bleed! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
3,Stick To Acting,"When I first saw her ""I Can't Wait"" music video, I thought ""Way to go, she can sing!"" but I listened to her Christmas songs and it really is the same old pink pop that you hear from everyone else. And she is an actress. Disney wanted to make her bigger, so they add backround singers to every word she sings, and presto, a gorgeous voice. But what people don't realize is that she is singing softly with like 3 other backround singers. They have good technology these days, and using it they could take a voice like mine or yours, and turn it into Britney Spears. That is what I think happenend with Hillary Duff. Great actress, I look up to her in that way. And I do give her credit for making the cd, but really, I think that everyone has heard a voice like that before."
5,Not just for teenagers...,"Not just for teenagers...My grandpa loves this cd, so does my Dad, I think they just like to drool over Hilary's big bust, but that's ok the good lord made her with a perfect figure, she's overdeveloped and can sing like an angel!!!You know Hilary's sexy and your jelous of her bust sizeNot only that but you are jelous of her talent. Nobody on this planet sings better then Hilary Duff, this cd RULES the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's sold millions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,Hilary is gonna get coal for this peice of junk,"Santa Clause Lane....Now I wish I had asked for a gun for Christmas. Hilary, you need a life intead of ruining others by making music. How much I love christmas music...until her cd came out, it's a horrible excuse for a christmas album. She would be better of singing herself instead of being drown by back up singers and a computer generated voice if not. Not mmuch more to say but this is such a shame."
1,this deserves -10 stars!,"hilary's singing almost made me heave when i listened to this cd. for all you who think it's good, i think you are smoking something."
2,I never want to visit Santa Claus Lane,"When I used to work at a toy store last Christmas, we always had to listen to this cd. I thought it sucked, Hilary Duff can't sing at all! I gotta admit she looks pretty good looking on the cover though..."
5,A Must For a Holiday Gift,I think this cd is a great stocking stuffer. It has alot of pop in it w/some hip-hop. It adds a little flair to Christmas time. I'm 14 years old and I think any girl who needs a role model and likes exciting and easy to dance to music needs to get this cd. It's great for a slumber party w/ your best girlfriends!!!
5,Santa Claus Lane,"ho ho ho merry christmas, this christmas album is awesome. i liked it alot. the best songs on this disc aresanta claus lane, jingle bell rock, wonderful christmas time"
5,best christmas cd I own!,"I love this cd, I listen to it every year. Out of all the christmas cds my family and I own, excluding the classics, this is our favorite to listen to during the holidays. Hilary Duff can sing and she sounds beautiful and full of holiday spirit."
5,Hilary Duff's great Debut!,"In my opinion ""Santa Claus Lane"" is one of the best Holiday Albums! I bought this album recently (I know, I'm really late) and I enjoy it very much. It will be a must to blast this CD on Christmas Eve/Day. One of my favorite songs on the album is ""Santa Claus Lane"" which is upbeat, and very dancy! Honestly the album is a 11/10 for me, great debut to start off with, and a great idea to begin with a Holiday Album, Merry Christmas Everyone! (Great CD for a present)"
4,"Fun, pleasant holiday sound","This is a nice holiday record. I don't think anyone will ever consider it a classic, but it's fun and that's what Christmas is about. Hilary has a nice, if not exceptional voice, and the songs including a new holiday song Santa Claus Lane are all well chosen. Well, maybe not all of them. What's with the rap thing? Program that one out and you have a hit. Fans of Lizzy and/or Hilary will really like this."
1,untalented,"i wonder how people like this get the money to make a career for themselves. the girl needs to go back to school and study acting and voice, because she has no talent"
1,An Insult to All Unknown Talented Singers,"I feel insulted that they put this girl on the market as a ""singer"". Please! Save this CD space for someone more talented. Even Ryan Starr from American Idol can sing better than this."
1,"Stocking Stuffer, yea right!","Do you people not notice that it is not santa on the cover, it is Hilary Duff, i know she wieghs more. I mean even she would recommend a Big Mac as a stocking stuffer over this (she has 9234 stockings and asks for those in each one).These are not classics just a disgrace."
4,Defintely worth a listen,"I find it odd that many Hilary Duff discographies tend to ignore this album; in fact even Hilary's official website doesn't list it. Too bad, because it's a decent debut offering from Duff and Disney. Songs like ""What Christmas Should Be"" and ""I Heard Santa on the Radio"" are well-written pop tunes that will have you humming the chrous long after you first hear them. Grade A Guilty Pleasure."
3,Hilary makes Holiday Songs worth Listening to...,"Now, I'm not a big fan of Holiday songs, but Hilary makes them actually worth listening to. I don't know what some reviewers are talking about, I think she hits the tones just right. But sticking Lil' Romeo in her song ""Tell me a Story"" takes a star right off the album. If you want music to cheer you up, this definitely will do the trick."
5,Natural Born Talent,"Hillary Duff is a great actor cute, funny, and a role model. I think her Voice is just what disney needs( too bad that they didn't discover it sooner). Her songs are heaven for me. I have tried to get them at Target for a LONG time. Hillary is a friend to me even though I don't know her. Next time she has a concert I hope I'm there to hear it. Every cd that she makes would be AWESOME to get. With her talent she could be a star forever. I mean when she was about eight when she made her first MOVIE. It is casper meets Wendy. If you can't see her talent from this review then you have a way DIFFERENT taste in singing and Shows than me."
3,"Hilary made an effort, more than most would have nerve to do","Hilary is a beautiful girl, she just doesnt have the voice to make it in the music industry. I rated her a three just for effort and having the nerve to try something new. Most people are too afraid to do something they have never done before so to all the people out there that say they hate Hilary Duff's voice and her attitude, just remember she's where she is now because of her talent and she made it this far without your rediculous opinions. she doesnt need people bashing her for trying, she deserves respect."
5,My Favorite Christmas CD,"I have had this CD since I was what, in middle school? However, I couldn't find it so I had to buy a new one. I absolutely love it. It's my all time favorite Christmas CD and Christmas wouldn't be the same without it. It also has original Christmas songs, which is nice."
2,Hilary Duff - Stick to Acting!,"I'll admit that Hilary is a good actress but she CAN NOT SING! She is just about the worst singer I have ever heard and if u think that I just have bad taste in music you're wrong! I like ppl like Aaron Carter, BSB, Jump 5, Play, and all those kind of ppl but Hilary Duff is not like them to me she's practically a fake. Hilary Duff should stick to acting that's what she was ment for!"
2,Hilary - Go back to just acting PLEASE,"She's cute and perky. She can sing too but she's not that great. If she were not so popular would she have ever been able to release a single song? No. Jingle Bell Rock is a great example. No range. No presence. Just weak singing. There are probably thousands of young girls out there who can sing better. Hilary should stick to what she does best, campy acting.."
5,Yummy Tummy!,"I wish people would stop trashing this CD. It's not for listening to, if you haven't figured that out already. It's for us young heterosexual males to drool over its cover. As at least one other perceptive reviewer has noted (many, many times), Hilary is simply yummy to look at. So leave us alone with our Hilary CD and stop banging on the bathroom door. We'll be out in a few minutes, okay?"
1,what the hell,they need to stop and think about putting this girl on the music scenne and she cant even sing britney spears is better compared to hillary duff she better stick to acting. and dont use talented people to make her famous.
1,Say No to this CD,"I like Hilary and all, but she can't sing. she should stick to acting. Are you reading this, Hil?"
2,I've Heard Better,"Hilary Duff has acting talent; she just may have singing talent, but she doesn't display much of it in these songs.Perhaps the mistake I made was listening to Jump5's Christmas album ALL THE JOY IN THE WORLD before this one. Now THEY have talent. In comparison with Jump5's ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" ""Rockib' Around the Christmas Tree"" or especially ""Sleigh Ride,"" among others, Hilary Duff's versions are barely passable. This CD does, however, have a couple of songs which are considerably better. But if you want a great kids' Christmas CD, do yourself a favor and just buy ALL THE JOY IN THE WORLD."
3,Hilary's not so good...,"The songs she sings are nice songs, but her voice isn't exactly the best thing I've ever heard. I'm sick of her, if you ask me."
1,A Disney Sugar-Coated Piece of ...,"Wow! Hilary Duff is hot. But does that help her singing skills? I think not, unless you can add as much reverb and chorus to the tracks as these producers have. If you have listened to the songs, you would know the singing isn't the main piece of work on this album; however, the well-produced music. Throw in some baby rappers and established artists and you have an album of pure .... Hope this helped."
1,Pan & Scanning is no excuse!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!! Wait until they release a TRUE restored 4:3 version of this film. Pan and scanning is unacceptable, I don't care what broadcasters and regular people think... the true audience of this footage are people interested in history and want to capture every single detail. This is unacceptable, in fact, it's so far out and ridiculous that I can't even believe it."
1,No closed captions/provisions for hearing impaired,"The miniseries was terrific but the DVD has one unacceptable (for me) flaw: It has no provisions for the hearing impaired. There is no closed captioning. I bought this as a gift for someone who is hearing impaired and was forced to return it.Such a cheap, shoddy decision for production is unworthy of the fine miniseries."
2,Slanted towards English,"Many of the documentaries are very well done but there is an overall theme that the British won the war with a little help from everyone else.The Pacific War - along with Pearl Harbor were very disapointing. Also the constant overtheme that the Americans were there enjoying themselves more than fighting and sacrificing was rather insulting. Some great documentaries, but if you want to see anything about the American involvement - buy something else."
1,Best Ever WWII Footage; Worst Ever Quality Control,"At one time I too owned this set. I returned the box set back to the seller for a full refund. Possibly the best footage of WWII ever put together, HOWEVER both my sets were defective. The picture constantly broke up (pixelation) and some chapters were entirely missing.The World At War was released prior to the 30th Anniversary Box Set and the quality was worse than this version.The original release was a mess...Example: Disc 4; Side 1 and Side 2 were exactly the same and EVERY disc had a pixelation problem.The 30th Anniversary Box Set I experienced pixelation on a number of discs. You would think they would get it right the 2nd time.I ended up returning both sets and decided to wait for another release. Too bad, I LOVE THIS SERIES.My recommendation is to wait until the series is re-issued by another manufacturer. If you wait long enough, the set may also be remastered."
5,War is hell...War is brutal...here it is for all to see.,"If there is one video history of World War Two worth owning this is it. Between the incredible footage and Olivier's narration, this collection is absolutely riveting. Interviews with soldiers from both sides, civilians from both sides, even Albert Spaer(Hitler's Minister of Industry) place you inside the greatest conflict of our times.Watching this collection will make you rethink your place in the world today. It is something every person should see. Remember."
5,The World at War,"I got this for my husband's birthday and I believe it is the best video documentary I have ever seen. Even the trademark musical score is beautifully compelling and the filming and flow of information and detail is brilliant. I highly recommend this to anyone that would like to learn about this pivital period of history. The series is informative, entertaining and elegantly delivered."
4,Nice Comprehensive Review,"Great footage along with nice narration. Of course, you cannot cover every single incident of the War but this collection does cover a great deal across many fronts and in many countries. There is also some nice color footage as well spread throughout the series. Some of the extra documentaries about Hilter, I found to be very interesting. The sound is not the best. Subtitles are not available. That is the only drawback. All in all, a really nice, thorough collection."
5,THE WORLD AT WAR 30TH ANNIV ED,"ENJOYED THE DVD, MOST INFORMATIVE PIECE OF WORLD HISTORY. INFO NOT GIVEN BY NEWS MEDIA. WELL DONE. EASILY UNDERSTOOD, GRAPHIC TRUTH REVEALED. KEEPER"
5,Extremely educational and entertaining.,"My husband is still working his way through this series of DVD's. What a great collection of video facts, real life stories, actual footage from the war. Lots of things we've never seen anywhere else. Very, very well done!"
5,Release on Instant Video Please!,Fantastic Series and have owned it on DVD for over ten years. Please convince the History Channel/BBC to release this on instant video for download. Holding off on buying becasue I don't want another set of DVDs taking up space in my house.
1,Unacceptable butchering of historic footage!,"Cropping ""World at War"" documentary is just scandalous ! I'm chocked and can't believe it !People risked their lives and many died to get these images ! ... and now some irresponsible, ignorant lowbrows butcher it !Unbelievable !The people behind this should apologize to the victims and veterans of WWII."
3,Aspect Ratio OK - Blu Ray unnecessary,"I've just bought this and watched episode 1. I think the aspect ratio is a non issue and the edition looks fine on widescreen TV.However, it is a waste of money to get the Blu Ray edition. The war footage is no clearer in Blu Ray. Save some bucks and get the DVD version."
2,The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition),The best WW2 series I have seen.Be wary of the DVD set. Besides freezing discs a couple of episodes are repeated in place of the one indicated. Poorly mastered. I sent mine back and purchased the VHS set. I purchased the DVD set early and hopefully the mastering problem has been corrected.
4,Certainly the best of the World War II documentaries,"This series was always by far the best ever produced about the Second World War. It is excellent in every way. However, never, ever, should they have altered the original order of episodes. History should be told in the order in which it occured and not haphazardly as this set does. The new episodes they created for this DVD set should all have been at the end of the original series instead of being inserted among the original episodes and with the original episodes mixed up in their order.Still, it is well worth the price because of it's historical value and the unique and very interesting film content, the excellent interviews, as well as Laurence Olivier's absolutely beautiful narration.I will always treasure The World At War as I have now for 35 years.Just four stars because of the alteration of the order of the original episodes."
5,What popular history should be!,"This gigantic effort is excellent. The episodes are to the point but also include a great deal of understanding of just how horrid WWII was for the countries devastated during the nearly six years a insanity. From the opening of each episode, replete with faces in the fire and unforgetable music, to the recap the photgraphy and sound track and the elegant narration by Olivier to the completion excellence abounds. It would be fruitless to contrast The World at War with the garbage that abounds on commercial tv today, but it's sad to think how far we have fallen, from the sublime to the witless, eg Survivor, American Idol, etc."
4,Translations needed!,"This 30th Anniversary Edition of The World at War has been reviewed extensively at this site, and I agree with the majority of reviewers that this series is one of the greatest documentaries about World War II. However, I have to complain that translations are often wanting. For example, in the two-part bonus to the series on Disc 10, entitled The Final Solution, there are long stretches of archival footage of German-language speeches and documentaries that contain NO TRANSLATION into English. These sections of the series are a void to those viewers who do not speak German. The World at War series is an English-language production, but this bonus documentary, as wonderful as it is in other respects, fails to reach most of its audience when translations are not provided. It is frustrating to see and hear these stretches of documentary that are inaccessible to those of us who do not understand German."
5,It's great to have this on dvd at an incredible price,"I watched this series on PBS in the seventies and was forever hooked! there has never been such a definitive work done on world war two as this, nor do I expect there will be in the near future. Sir Laurence Olivier's subperb narration guides you through almost every aspect of the most defining period of the twentith century.You can never grow weary of viewing this fine production as every time you view it, you will surley pick up on something you missed on the last viewing! All real, no phoney reenactments. A never ending history lesson."
4,Great gift for a history lover!,"I bought this for my husband after reading the great reviews it was given by others on Amazon. He has really enjoyed it! He says the details and information are exactly what he wanted. The episodes are about an hour each, so the huge length of the entire set is made into more manageable pieces to watch."
5,The World at War DVD collection,"I enjoyed this series when it came out in the '70's (used to show it on Thursday nights on our local PBS station). Being a history buff, the series is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it for someone delving into WWII from an alternative media source other than books."
4,Good video set,"I replaced the VHS set with this DVD set. The image quality was much better than tape, and the extra features were well worth while."
1,Idiots in charge of blu-ray authoring again!,"I bought the blu-ray off amazon and I am EXTREMELY disappointed that it is in 16/9.All the interviews have the picture chopped off half way up their forehead. Terrible.I plan to sell the blu-ray and try and buy a 4/3 DVD set.The idiots in charge of production should have their round anatomical bits shot off for this travesty.Honestly, what possessed them to do this?Stretching the picture has lost me 25% of the original image.Unpardonable."
1,Keep the receipt,"While I echo the other reviews as regards the quality of the series, my box set had production errors in it. Disc 2 side 2 was the same as Disc 1 side 2. I don't know if this was a widespread manufacturing error, or whether it is unique to the set I purchased. This is an egregious error for the price of the set, and is why I rank this only 1 star. Apart from the erratum in my box set, the series itself is great, albeit with a British perspective."
5,"Truly Fantastic, How Can One Fault It.","Simply put, it is one of the best total documentaries on the Second World War. Olivier is moving and the bonus footage makes the 30th Anniversary Edition truly worth every cent. Buy it and share it and use it to make people understand that this event will effect human lives for hundreds if not thousands of years."
1,Buy the Standard Definition Version,"Considering that most of the original footage was 16mm, one would have thought that the manufacturer would have presented in the footage in the original format. They did not. The Blu-Ray version is merely re-scanned with the top and bottom of the images cut off to fit a 16 by 9 format. A great deal of visual information was lost. Buy the DVD. I'd give that a five star rating."
5,Epic,"Few historical accounts, print or video, possess the depth and detail as in ""The World at War"". A must-have for war buffs and an amazing tool for 20th century history students. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent production,"I lived thru the big one as a teenager, lost several realatives so I know what it was all about. This does a good job of bringing it all to light."
5,One of the most complete documentaries ever,"An excellent documentary on WW2. Filled with eyewitness accounts, extensive footage, brutal honesty; not the modern revisionist way of treating history."
5,Indescribable,"This is by far the best WWII documentary I have ever seen. I'm in the middle of my 3rd viewing (since 1991).Laurence Olivier's mesmerizing narration along with the first rate selection of material makes for an experience you will never forget.Of the thoughts I've pondered by watching this series, these standout:1) Never think, ""Surely nobody could be that evil."" There is no abomination imagined that human beings will not do to one another.2) Humanity never learns. Lethargy, apathy, appeasement---these mindsets left unchecked in free nations almost always creates a power void, and given such an opportunity, despots take full advantage.3) I am so thankful that I was born after the war. It's beyond me how that generation survived not only the war, but the tens years of economic depression that preceeded it.Buy it! You will not be disappointed."
1,"Cropped, eh? Another bone-headed play...","My copy of this Blu Ray just arrived, and I see that it is cropped from 1.33 to 1.78.As a historian, I protest! Just how many times do the producing powers that be need to be told: *preserve the vision of the original artistic work.*Period.Do *not* crop original widescreen to 4:3; do *not* crop original 4:3 to widescreen.Leave nothing out that is in the master, and leave nothing on the cutting room floor.If you cannot understand this very basic act of integrity, then it is time to find some other line of work. Perhaps nursing, where ""do no harm"" is the guiding principle, eh?So, regretably, this Blu Ray will be returned for refund. Perhaps the History Channel will do it right the next time, the simpletons....editorpf"
1,WAS GOING TO ORDER....,"Was going to order this set but saw all the reviews that this set is butchered, I own the dvd set and would like the bluray to be the same aspect ratio. So this wont be a purchase for me, I really can't believe that they would re-format it to 16x9, really ignorent people working at that company."
5,world at war,"This series is a must have in any second world war buffs collection. Unbiased and not revisionist unlike more contemporary documentaries on the subject, this series gives a detailed account as eye-witnessed by those at the centre of the conflict. There is little narration done which leads to a more objective interpretation of the events that happened. Too many current documentaries on the subject stereotype the participants as either good (in the case of the Allies) or bad (as in the case of Germany). The world at war shows that the events that occur in ""the fog of war"" are neither neither black or white but lie somewhere in between. You wont go back once you have seen this series. A masterpiece."
5,The World at War 30th Anniversary Edition,"The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)I have purchased many DVDs about WW2 and this one sits near or at the top of the list. The 50 minute episodes make it easy to keep track of the many events during WW2. The episodes are interesting and informative. The series has excellent footage and the narration by Sir Laurence Olivier is top notch. The recent price reduction really makes it an exceptional value. I think it is a ""must"" purchase for any WW2 or history buff."
1,Not for the hearing impaired,"unfortunately, none of these videos are closed captioned nor do they have subtitles. Again the hearing impaired get left in silence. What a disappointment. I'm selling mine."
5,World at War,Made at a time when War time emotions still affected the commentary - never the less - the stills and motion pictures themselves don't lie. So until a Ken Burns comes along and re does this with lots of facts - we won't be able to do better. In other words - this is worth looking at - just for the images - but take the commentary with a grain of salt.
3,totally truncated don't BUY!,"While I enjoy the series,buyer beware this NOT a faithful reproduction.Case in point the invasion of poland.That was a whole episode,and quite frankly it set the tone for the whole series of battles that followed,it totally truncated the conquest of poland.By my estimation about 20 minutes!.A truly great episode.I have not reached the the phony war episode yet....but if i don't get the song.....""le boomb.etc"" just before the germans attack this babby's goes back to COSTCO!"
2,Just okay ...,"The very first episode was great ... after that it was hit and miss. I found multiple times I wanted to fall asleep on some episodes, but stayed awake out of some desire to feel I watched the whole thing. It is also narrated from a British perspective, and so as an American, I found little to entertain my appetite. Especially Pacific theatre combat with the Americans was almost none existent, as if British combat and especially in Burma was the only real thing that happened. It does have good insights into the Nazi's and rewards itself here and there, but overall I think the British slant and focus ruined the series.I also found it humorous that the narrator tried to label Hitler as ""right-wing"" when he was a Socialist dictator. What?"
4,DVD error corrected,"The DVD error (duplication of disk 1, side 2, on disk 2, side 2)has been corrected. This is a great series.However, it does present a decidedly European ""socialist"" ""pacifist"" slant. In the post 9/11 world, that viewpoint is quite dated.Keeping this in mind, it is, however, an excellent series. I am giving it 4stars, only because its political premise does not stand up today."
1,History of History,re 25-30% of the image hacked off so a new generation of viewers won't know what they're missing:People are shocked by this? Some people need to study a bit of historiography and art history along with their war history. The victorious march of the Philistines has been trampling out our culture like the Nazi blitz through the western U.S.S.R. for more than a century now. And no long winters to stall them before Moscow predicted.I wonder which version Goebbels would have preferred?
1,Mr,The videos that I received were supposed to be new but the videos had no sound when they were played
5,Ultimate WWII review,"I consider myself a novice history buff in regards to WWII. However this set covered details that I had not been aware of including the politics of the war and the aftermath. There is a multitude of movie clips that can be seen in this set that likely cannot be seen anywhere else.Also included is a lengthy interview with Stephen Ambrose who wrote 'Band of Brothers' and consulted on 'Saving Private Ryan'. Note the seventys hairdo.Although 26 hour-long episodes may seem like a lot, the content is well worth it."
2,Great Documentary/Poor Blu-ray version,"As mentioned in other reviews, cropping the original film for the Blu-ray version was poor planning by the editors. Ignore the history revisionist clown that goes by History Reader. What he says and the texts that are listed are from the less than one percent lunatic fringe that occasionally spouts off. Just ask a veteran that served in WWII who witnessed the liberation of the Nazi death camps, they are well documented. Sadly, may of the veterans from that war have passed away. It would be better to purchase the DVD than the Blu-ray for this fine documentary. I will purchase a Blu-ray version if they restore it to the original aspect ratio.cave canem"
3,No English subtitles!,To our surprise the dvds do not have english subtitles (or any other language subtitles!)
1,Buyer Beware,"This was a wonderful documentary as originally broadcast, but I'd avoid this product if I had it to do over again: the maker's quality control is awful. Disk 1 skipped badly. And I the same problem others have reported: two copies of one of the five disks (with me, disk 5), and one disk (disk 4) entirely missing."
5,Deeply touched by this serie.,"Some people think past time was better than present, i dare you to watch this and try to say the same thing again. Very sad, very informative and gives us an insight of where we come from and why we should try to avoid war at any cost. Human life is very precious. This is a must have. Even when it is in blu ray the picture quality is not great but this is not something stagged or made to impress. I highly recommend this set and its the best series i bought from Amazon."
1,Boondoggle! Avoid this set and get the DVDs,You can still get the 12 DVD set of this series with excellent mastering and the correct aspect ratio for a third of the price of this bluray set. The image quality on the DVDs looks just as good as the sample frame grabs from the bluray. And the DVD has two additional hours of supplemental material.All you get with this bluray boondoggle is a third less picture and three times the price tag... Oh! And a documentary describing how they chopped the image up so they could sell it to cable TV. Swell.The people who made this set are not your friends. Caveat emptor.
5,One of the best made-for-TV series ever shown,"This truly is one of the best made-for-TV series ever shown. For WWII buffs and military historians of all stripes, watch it - you will not be disappointed."
1,poor knock-off of a quality scoop,"i bought this scoop thinking i was adding to the 3 i already own and love, but which do not have any indication of the manufacturer name (which i now know is RSVP). the cuisinox scoop doesn't have the right balance or heft to the scoop or length in the handle. it also has some noticeable and unattractive weld marks that joins the scoop to the handle. the web picture looks just like the ones i already own - oriented and lit so you don't see the flaws or subtle difference (or maybe it's not even a picture of what you get!) now i know better!"
1,Great demolition hammer,"If you need to break concrete, form steel, or just convince something to be in it's place, this is a great hammer. Hey, Amazon refuses to let me leave a five star original review, so, here's a stupid one, review removed 10 times, stupid moderators = trolls"
5,Loved it.,"Perfectly fresh and funny look at the standup comedy world. Lved it, loved it, loved it!!!"
5,"Colorful, offbeat and fun!",I first heard about this movie from friends who visited the little Mexican fishing village where it was shot. And I was so pleased to finally be able to see it. It's quirky and very original and fun -- and you get drawn into the stories as you are seduced by the beautiful photography of this old-fashioned world on Mexico's tropical coast. There are things about the movie that remind you it isn't a big budget movie -- but the warmth and intimacy and hopefulness of the story more than makes up for that. Plus the soundtrack is excellent. My thanks to the filmmakers for making a movie with heart!
5,This film is becoming a cult legend,I'm so glad I found this movie on DVD. I saw it at the San Franciso Film Festival and thought it was amazing. I got to hear all the actors and filmmakers speak and was so impressed. This movie is what independant filmmaking is all about. They shot it on this impossibly small budget and it just turned out so cool. It actually inspired me to go down to the little Mexican village it was filmed in on vacation. Down there this film has a huge cult following. It's great. Buy it.
4,A truly magical movie,"This movie is filled with honesty and magic. Every character is authentic and immediately the viewer is drawn into their story. The story is sensitively and artfully told by the director Mick Diener.This is one those rare movies that shows the trials of the human existence, but then renews are faith in the human spirit."
4,Vacation In A Box!,"Just watching this DVD gives you feeling of getting down to a beautiful tropical place - the kind of trip we always want to take and do not always have the time (or $) to go on.Better still the naturalistic style of both the direction and the acting help to disolve the boundary between viewer and film and instead you have the warm feeling of visiting with friends - people you know.The film has laughs and soul - each character is working toward a better understanding of ""where"" they are in their lives and as opposed to many of the films of the day where there are no chraracters to care about - I found myself rooting for all of them.A must watch on a cold winter's night!"
3,A bit of light entertainment on a slow evening...,"I must say that it is neither a 5-star nor a 1-star, for the other reviewers seem to have chosen a side. It is, however, a solid 3-stars, if you go into it w/o expectations; you can add another half star if you have your significant other sitting next to you. It's a 'B' movie, no doubt; but, it isn't garbage. The scenery is nice, the actors are generally likable, and their acting is at-best, or, at-worst, okay, depending if you are a glass have full or half empty kind of person. Watch it on a slow night with your significant other while eating popcorn. You wont feel like you wasted the night.Rating: I'm not really sure why it is rated R."
1,Are you kidding???!!!,"This is one of the worst movies ever produced.The actors (especially Alisa Conaboy) are pathetic,to say the least. They've taken a magnificentlocation and bastardized it in a worthless storythat ends in mutual defecation. That about sumsup the entire story - people defecating together,like any roadside toilet."
1,"The Film Makers should have asked, Which Way!","We all have a certain amount of hours to live from birth to the grave. Don't waste a second your life, or your money buying this boring film, it's a load of cods-wallop!.The settings may be pretty to look at, but all the characters are so dysfunctional, that they become irritating to watch. If they could act it may have been somewhat tolerable. Unacceptable language (and there's plenty of that) is no excuse for a lack of knowledge of the English language.The camerawork and storyline is definitely first month Film School, which begs one to suggest that the production team should have asked ""Which Way, Por Favor?"" before they started on their journey into filmmaking. They certainly got lost on the way.I give this film one star, only because the transfer to DVD is acceptable in both picture and sound."
5,Something about Michael Schenker,"The best guitar player is coming from Hannover- Germany. Mr. Michael Schenker. You can hear him on this great Album. People who didn't know about Michael Schenker are poor people. But you can change your live and become rich and buy all the albums he has recorded with The Scorpions, UFO and The Michael Schnker Group.This comes from a Schenker fan from The Netherlands"
5,"What can I say, it's the best.","Michael Schenker at his best, just before leaving the band. A great album, the only one I have on cassette, vinyl, and two CD versions. One of the great British rock bands overlooked by most."
5,Stunning remasters,"I have purchased the entire UFO catalog four times now: lp, cd, cd remaster, and this remaster. Other than the very first purchase, this time has been the most satisfying. I have gotten quite burnt out on the remaster-repurchase money pit, but that money has never been better spent than on this reissue series. Put aside the fact that this is some of the best rock ever recorded, these remasters sound PHENOMENAL. The frequency response is to the limit, with crystal clear cymbals and bass that shakes your body; the clarity is perfect; and the imaging is absolutely amazing. These albums have been reborn. Schenker's guitar, which has always had an atmospheric quality to it, now burrows into your brain. You will hear elements you never noticed before, and you will hear the familiar with a refreshing clarity and intensity. If you like UFO (and if you don't, what's wrong with you?) buy these remasters! Oh, man, they sound SO good!"
4,Highly recommanded,"This is the last studio album with Michael Schenker on guitar (although he rejoined in the mid 1990's for the releases of the excellent ""Walk on water"", ""Covenant"" and ""Sharks""). ""Obsession"" is a very strong effort and I believe it's one of the finer from UFO, with such strong tunes like the appealing mid tempo rocker ""Only you can rock me"", the musically diverse and interesting ""Looking out for no.1"", and ""Hot `n' ready"" with its groovy guitar riff. Even the instrumental tracks (""Arbory hill"" and ""Looking out for no.1 reprise"") seem motivated and not just there for the lead guitarist to show off by playing as many notes as possible in the shortest possible time, which seem to be the main purpose with many instrumental heavy metal tunes. There are in fact not a single low mark on this release. If you like good vintage hard rock from 1970's, ""Obsession"" is absolutely for you!"
5,Excellent product for the mondy,"I am using the produuct now. It does come with a small carrying case for all the needed adapters. Instructions list just about any notebook that's on the market. Can easily switch between 12V outlet and 125V cords. Tips simple to switch out if you have more than one notebook PC. You can get this same exact item at BestBuy, but plan on spending twice as much!"
2,Bad Game!,"Desert quad STINKS! All you do is ride around in circle. alright graphics, but there is no fun to the game. There's two modes (single race and tourney)-even if it sounds cool is is a bore! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS-- THEY ARE SUCKY CHEAP GAMES. HOWEVER, I HAVE NEVER PLAYED MONSTER TRUCKS. my friend told me it was horrible. But who knows? Buy monster truck game induvidually."
2,Great for little ones starting,"I got this game for my boys who at the time, were under 6. Great for those beginner players. Graphics aren't that great, but it does the trick."
3,Nothing for Adults with Asperger's,"Once again, another book about Asperger Syndrome that focuses almost exclusively on children. This would be a great book for a parent, educator, etc. What people forget, is that children with Asperger's eventually grow up and become adults with Asperger's. It seems that those of us who are adults with this disability have fallen through the cracks. There is very little published to help adults on the autistic spectrum. I experienced bullying not just as a child, but also as an adult in the workforce, to the point where I was forced to quit working altogether."
4,Helpful guide for parents,"As the mom of an Aspie who is being bullied I found the information timely and helpful. Harrassment is a very complex issue, but this book breaks it down into all it's components nicely. The real life stories just broke your heart, but are all too familliar.The aspect I found the most surprising was on the kids who want to help but instead are on the sidelines watching it happen, and why they act that way. Each situation is different, but I feel this book will be helpful to most parents with an Aspie child. Maybe one of the true life stories will speak to your situation. The insights given by one AS adult looking back on his bullied childhood was very helpful to me in our situation.At the very least, it is comforting to know that as a parent you aren't alone in your pain!"
4,LEAVES SKIN SOFT AND SMOOTH,"Jason, makers of pure, natural, organic products, recently introduced a line of 70% Certified Organic Hand & Body Lotions. These are intense moisturizers that absorb quickly. Available in 8 scents, they are reasonably priced.One of them is Glycerine & Rosewater Hand & Body Lotion, an extra rich, creamy emollient that addresses the problem of dry skin. Vitamin B and Herbal Extracts add to its efficacy."
3,This product not only felt greasy and thick ...,"This product not only felt greasy and thick on my skin, but it also had a man's scent. One advantage in that it protects the skin from UV rays, but given how thick it feels on your skin, it should. The scent is really strong and overbearing; however, it fades after about 20 minutes. I'd recommend this product to men because of the scent and feel to the skin, but I wouldn't recommend this product for women."
3,I put some on every time I washed ...,"I put some on every time I washed my hands for five days. It has a nice, mild smell and absorbs well as long as I didn't put too much on. It's a nice hand cream, but nothing special. I was hoping to see results, because it has ingredients to fight skin aging. I didn't notice anything different from other hand creams. I think it's a little pricey and wouldn't purchase it again at this price."
5,This lotion is a 10! It goes on ...,"This lotion is a 10! It goes on with a non-greasy feel and a fragrance that's not overbearing!! I love it! Most lotions that are scented are so overbearing, but Jason's hand therapy has a subtle scent and, in turn, also gives the therapy I need for my hands and the UV protection I need when I'm in the sun! I've already noticed a difference from using this just a few days."
1,Broke out,I have used this product for years and ran out so I found it on Amazon. I see by the package that it has improved its formula. I tried it three times and it made my whole face red like sunburn and the first time it lasted about an hour and after that it lasted for at least a day and my face was sensitive for several days. I will not use this product again and am disappointed because I loved the original formula and never had issues.
2,Leaves me greasy ans smelling funny,"Every summer the NW atmosphere curses me with dry, tight, ugly looking skin, and this year has been the worst in memory. I picked up a bottle of Jason Hemp lotion because I do swear by hemp oil (the stuff is absolutely amazing) and because I use Jason vitamin E cream and have had no problems with it. Sadly, this lotion just wasn't worth the cost. It leaves my skin greasy, which causes irritating bumps, and, for all that it has a very, very faint smell, it makes me smell funny. To clarify, my partner has not noticed the smell, so it can't be terribly strong; nevertheless, I notice it, and that is bad enough.The bottom line is that I would not recommend this lotion unless your skin is flaking badly and it is the only hemp lotion available. I know I will not be buying Jason Hemp lotion again."
1,Too strong,"Be careful with this product. We like other Jason products. In fact, we use the Rosewater bath gel and love it but this lotion is waaaaaay too strong. It sort of smells like rosewater but it's so strong and pungent that my whole family did not enjoy it. You may, but just letting you know what we think about it."
3,Decent,"Makes my skin feel amazing, but the smell is just gross. It has a weird after smell, it's hard to explain, but def not something you want to smell all day. Also the bottle is small so if you are using it as an all over lotion, you will go through it really fast."
5,A Very Relaxed Trower's Release,"This Work of the Superb Guitarrist Robin Trower is full of laid back moments, a joyfull experience for the hears, higly recommended. Sweet Wine of Love, Bluebird, and falling star are delicious,The best version of Further Up The Road (Including Clapton's and Buchanan's versions) and the Bolero's Rhythm title track is very good too, enjoy!"
5,Another treasure by Cathie Linz,"Joe Wilder is very sexy, a strong, silent kind of guy (like Gary Cooper in those old movies on AMC). Prudence Martin is his commanding officer's daughter, and Joe is surprised that his CO is trying to match him up with her. Very intimidating situation, and at first he resists. But Prudence is such a kind, generous person, and very attractive, Joe can't resist her.The sparks really fly between these two, and they are wonderful people. I really enjoyed being with them and didn't want the book to end."
2,Disappointed,"After using these Imuffs for 8 months the battery died. At first I thought it was enjoyable to be wireless so I proceeded to use them for at least 5 hours a day. Unfortunately for me I started using them months after I bought them (largely due to them being too flimsy and not being able to use them in the winter). So, the battery died after the warranty had expired. It took several emails to get the company to exchange them and it has been a waiting game ever since. When I receive my replacement set I'll use them until they die and I'll definitely be switching to another brand."
3,Not great in Large cities,"I got a pair of these a few weeks ago and have been somewhat pleased. The biggest complaint I have is that they lose the signal walking around dowtown San Francisco everytime I get near a street corner with a traffic light. You can actually look at the light and tell that when the lights are changing that the headphones will cut off. Also, I've noticed passing some internet cafes that they cut off as well as the entire north side of Union Sq.I walk to work, so this is incredibly annoying. As long as I'm in my office they're fine though. I haven't tried them outside of the city yet though."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!,"This product is atrocious garbage. The headphones did not perform particularly well for the 6 months that they worked. Volume was very low and the ipod attachment kept falling out. Add to this that the sound quality is less than acceptable.The real topper is that after 6 months the phones would no longer take a charge. When I returned them to the manufacturer they refused to repair the item claiming that they are wet from my head perspiration!! Now I perspire as much as the next guy but please give me a break. If the phones can not stand up to normal sitting in a chair or walking perspiration they are useless. They claim the USB port is moldy. So fix it then! This is what the item is made for and it is still under warranty.I didn't pursue the matter as much as I might normally because the product stinks anyway.BUY A LOGITECH PAIR-They work better, sound better and after 3 years they are still dry!!"
1,"Poor, not for most people.","1) The product produces static. I'm not the only user to have this problem; see the company's web site.2) The product does not sit well on the head. It's flimsy and is hard to keep on.3) You'd think a product called iMuffs would work with Apple computers. Well, forget it, they don't.4) I signed on to the company's web site to get some assistance. They sent me a confirming email with my password in plain view--a serious security flaw.In sum: If you buy this product there's a good chance you'll regret it."
2,not for my ipod,had to return the headphone remote ( Imuff) with no problem. I would not work with IPOD Nano 3rd gen. works on others just not this generation. my return and refund was taken care of flawlessly.
1,Horrible!!!!!!,"Okay, I bought these headphones a few years ago and they broke in about 6 months. I loved them at the time so much that I wanted another pair and figured it was just a fluke. Well, I returned them and got a new pair and they said that my power switch had gone bad and replaced the unit. Then about 7 months later they broke again, I called to return them again and they said I could not return them a second time. Seems to me I should be able to return something as many times as I like since they're not give quality product to keep. Since I couldn't return them they offered to sell me another pair at a discounted price to help me with my problem. Mind you this was another brand new pair! So here it is six months later and once again, BAM! power switch stops working while its sitting on the charger. I have had enough with these people and there overpriced crap they peddle off on us. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!"
5,Superb Quality & sound - the best money you'll spend,I can't be more pleased with these. I purchased teh Logitech ones last year but it was clunky and the plastic headphone piece soon broke. These are a little wobbly but I'm just so impressed overall and these are priceless. Give yourself a treat and enjoy!
2,"What ever you do, don't sweat!","I've used these headphones quite a bit because I love the wireless functionality. They sound great. BUT, even though they say you can use them for sports, sweat will cause the whole things to corrode. The charging USB port is located on the bottom, which is where sweat collects. I've returned them several times and had them replaced, but now the company seems to be getting crabby about such returns and won't replace them because they don't cover ""moisture damage"".It seems to me that the main use for bluetooth headphones is active pursuits, such as biking, gym, running, etc. where you want to put the iPod in a protected place (bag, camelbak, etc.) and be able to control the ipod. So, for a pair of bluetooth headphones to be so completely unprotected from sweat is pure follyStay away."
3,not very good quality for the money,"I got the imuffs this past Christmas. What I don't like about them is the head piece is not adjustable so they don't have a nice fit on my head. What I do like is not having a wire getting in the way while on the treadmill. But because they don't fit well I accidentally dropped them once. One time and the volume button broke off. You would think that $190.00 would buy you a quality item. I have contacted their customer service. Apparently I am either the only person who has a pair or I am the only person who has ever dropped their product, because the customer service guy said no one has complained of a broken volume button. I'll be sending them in for repair soon, hopefully they will not try to wiggly out of the 1 yr. warranty. I will give an update on how satisfactory Wi-Gear customer service really is as soon as they get back with me."
1,Going back to wired,Over time I have found the link to be fragile. When it works the sound quality is fine but too often I have to battle with connection problems or the phones just can not keep up with the data rate and the audio drops out. When I get a minute to listen to some music I do not want to spend it playing with a gadget. I am going back to a wire.
2,Not for running,"I bought these hoping to run with them. They bounce around too much, and the music goes in and out. I also think it created some problems with my ipod. I sold them on ebay."
3,iMuffs MB210b Wireless Headphones for iPod (Black),"Seem to work fine with an iPod, however, I have had no luck getting it to work properly with a Motorola PEBL cell Phone. While listening to music on the iPod, if I get a phone call, I can answer the phone, but there's no audio, i.e., I can't hear who is talking, and they can't hear me. It's wierd that the controls work (call answer function) while the audio doesn't, but that's been my experience. Bummer!"
3,Looking to buy reciever!!!,My iMuffs work great... except I lost my reciever.Would you be willing to sell yours?I can be reached at fiona.sievwright.rn11@gmail.comThanks
1,not as good as i thought it would be,"i really wanted to like this because i like the actress...she was great in ""lovers in paris!""...but...i didn't think it was very funny...and the plot was...eh...:P"
2,it's all the same beat,"It's the better album of the two Joi C. albums I know, but it all has somewhat the same dance beat. All in all, the album is too mediocre and uninteresting. It's like the same song again and again"
2,Amplified aerial for HDTV,"Short cable to link to Digital converter or TV. Slighty flimsy aerials, one of which broke within 3 days.Does not perform very well in my city location, even though there are plenty of freeview channels available (SF, CA)"
2,Not as expected,"We live in a valley and I was expecting high hopes from this antenna after reading reviews here only to be disappointed. I works no better than my regular rabbit ears.Funny, a guy across town can receive 8 stations through the airwaves with a Radio Shack special while we are stuck at 3. I was hoping to at least receive one or two stations more.It probably works fine for those on flat land without obstacles.The good thing about this antenna is that it has a separate video switch so setting up your DVD player and playing it is as easy as flipping a switch."
1,"Very disappointed, I returned this product",Luckily I decided to get my DTV tuner early and have been enjoying the increase in stations and clarity of the digital signal since the they first became available. I got this antenna with high hopes but had NO improvement on reception with or without boost. The same thing happened with my FM reception and Tthis antenna did no better than a wire antenna strung along the ceiling line for FM. I do not recommend at all.
1,Only three channels in an apartment building in Washington DC,"I played with the angles and adjustments for several days with little success. I live in an apartment building in DC surrounded by other tall buildings. Perhaps this antenna is not really meant for such surroundings. I ended up getting cable after all for the little TV watching I do and connecting the antenna to my radio, which works very well."
4,What film commentary ought to be,"Rosenbaum is, for my money, the best film critic out there. His original essay on ""Dead Man"" led me to take another look at the film, which has since become one of my all-time favorite movies. This thoughtful commentary will help you think about what is probably the best American film made in the 1990s. And, if you like this, you should follow Rosenbaum's columns in the Chicago Reader. I often disagree with him, but there's no one more thoughtful, informed, and passionate about movies; he's a treasure."
3,Best? No. But great. Ok,"This was a great book. But I think that it was Stackpole's worst. Now, I am Vladimir Ward fan, so naturally this book was great, until all of a sudden Vlad and Clan side of the novel just finished without warning. Though the rest of the novel was brillinat I don't think Stackpole should have just dropped Vlad. I mean he was the centre of attension at the beginning (he got the first chapter), but half through the book it was like Stackpole got bored and decided to continue Victor's and Doc's side of the story. Another problem in the novel was kai. It was like some else wrote him. He didn't have the same attitude as he did in other novels. He was sort of distant and cold in this. Still great novel and worth the money."
3,Not my favorite Philosophy product but good.,These papers are great for blotting a little oil but the overall absorption isn't that great. I think that if these were thicker they would be more effective. I like them enough to use them whenever I need a little help with my midday shine but I do not like them enough to ever buy them again.
5,Lovely and Romantic,"One of the best movies ever made, i enjoyed every moment..the most beautiful way to fall in love and find love even 20 years ahead or before'"
5,Lovely,I found Secret to be a very moving and enchanting film. I enjoyed the mystique and intrigue. Secret is a captivating love story.
5,Wonderful,"This movie was wonderful. It was a pleasure to watch. No gratuitis sex, inuendos, or foul language. It was a little far fetched, but so are most love stories. No spoilers here. But if you are looking for a good movie to watch with your wife, earn some brownie points and watch this."
4,Couldn't Believe I Liked It,"I'm not a fan of romantic movies. Jet Li, John Wayne, Donnie Yen, these and similar names are the names that appear on most of the movies I watch. So you can see that romantic movies are not something I spend much time with. So if I say ""see this movie"" it's not something I say lightly. Not since 'Castaway on the Moon' have I been drawn into a love story that not only interested me so much but made me root for the characters and wanted them to get together and all those things that romantic movies try to accomplish. If you don't like romantic movies, give this one a try, I believe you will be in for a surprise. I certainly was. If you like romantic movies and haven't seen this one, then I'd question whether you really like romantic movies. Regardless, watch it. Besides the above mentioned Castaway on the Moon there is not a romantically inclined movie that I would more highly recommend."
