1,Waste of money,"The pillow doesn't feel bad or anything, and the quality is fine. At first, I thought it'd do me fine. However, I realized that the pillow's too firm and the arc not significant enough. I personally have a memory-foam topper on my bed, so I really don't need extra lift for my head. With this pillow, the back of your head will be a couple inches higher than your shoulders, which doesn't work out with a soft bed. I'm currently just using one of my down pillows and squashing it up into a cylinder-shape so that it sits under the arc of my neck. It feels much better, and the back of my head is in-line with the rest of my body, not propped up. If you have a firm mattress, you may not need to worry about all this."
5,Best Neck Pillow I have tried,"The first time I lay on the pillow, I could actually feel my sinuses drain immediately. My breathing during the night has improved substantially.Most importantly, the effect it has on my neck pain has been dramatic. I wake up with my neck completely relaxed. I am sleeping better than I have in months. My range of motion has improved. Everything just feels better.Another great thing about this pillow is its standard size and shape. It actually looks like a ""normal"" pillow on the bed (unlike all the other neck pillows I have tried)."
1,Didn't feel right,I have a herniated C6-C7 and I bought this to try and help. Tried it for a few weeks but it never felt right sleeping on it. Both my Ortho doctor and PT said to send it back. Amazon refunded money as always with no BS.
3,Great until it breaks down,"I've had this pillow for about a year. First impression was that the pillow is very soft. I had expected something with firmer support, so I was leery. Only the ""V"" section had some firmness to it, so I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The traction was not a problem at all, my head was nicely cradled and supported comfortably. I slept well with it.However, like virtually every pillow, the fill began to break down months later. The bottom of the ""V"" section collapsed until there was no support whatsoever. At the point when the pillow is shot, your head will fall into a valley with cushions by your ears, and nothing under your neck.Bottom line, this pillow is only good for six months."
2,Too Firm,I found this pillow uncomfortable to use. I was unable to rest on it for even 30 minutes. I generally find traction helpful for the neck but the V angle of the traction portion didn't appear to do anything. It was so narrow i wonder if most heads could rest in it.
3,Well Made But Much Too Large,"As a side sleeper looking for sleeping heaven, I bought this pillow three + months ago and wanted so much for it to work for me. It's very well made but as someone 5' 5"" the medium pillow is just too large to negotiate. There are two distinct sides: the ""over filled"" side for the therapeutics, which I use just prior to dozing off, and when ready to sleep, would flip it over to the flatter (gentler/smaller) side. That worked for awhile, but recently it feels that the flatter side is losing support for side sleeping, and I end up flipping it over to the stuffed side, which is much too high and hard to be comfortable. So neither side is working - it's disappointing that they don't make this pillow in smaller sizes because then I would have loved it."
2,Wish it worked for me.,"Pillow is nice, but not the right fit for me. I have a long neck, and maybe that's why. I just can't get comfortable in it."
3,Okay,I was not to pleased with either of these I hope I like other songs from R.Kelly the other reviews I feal are kind of wrong there not as good as they say they are
3,Time for some editing.,"We read the book, chose a school, and then the Board announced at the end of my son's freshman year that the school would be closed. Antioch College, rich history, a scholarship, and the promise of great co-op experience all down the drain.It never occured to me that I should investigate the financial stability of the schools before sending my son off. What still mystifies me is why this Board did not see their way clear to graduate all the students that were enrolled, allowing them to maintain their scholarships, and avoid a lot of angst. They did offer them a spot at their commuter locations spread all over the country and without residential capacity.Beware when reading this book. There are lots of good schools out there but I'm not sure this is the way to find them."
5,"Excellent, and informative","This book is a must have for anyone who is considering application to an Ivy League school. It's witty, informative, and at times, humorous. If you are a senior in high school, than you must read it before you even apply to any school."
2,over rated,"This book states the same few things over and over again. Small is good, status is unimportant in the long run, research universities dont care about undergrads... I agree with most of it but i want more!!!! Did she say anything different in her other book or just repackage the same ideas?"
2,Not so great ...,"This book was, informative but it was nothing that hasn't been heard before. Just because Mr. Pope is an 'authoritative figure' who does this (looking at colleges) for a living doesn't mean he is right. Also this book is terribly outdated. All the authors references are from the 60s too the late 80s. This is the year 2003 where this year 3 million high school seniors are competing for spots in colleges! It is also a time when tons of international students are comming in making it harder for 'average joe' to get into college. This book is focusing on the wrong things - there is just not enough about other colleges just his expierances with his clients. I was just very disapointed - if you want to read this book go to the library."
1,sappy little book,"This is a sappy little book with a propagandistic quality to it. I resented buying it. I prefer Choosing the right College by the conservative outfit (published by Eerdman's, 2000) whose name I forget. I am not conservative, but they at least have a viewpoint. This is just mindless trash that reiterates whatever the school has told him.Garbage for pumpkin heads."
5,La Bible Francaise,"I love this Bible. It has two bookmark ribbons and a hard cover. This has all of the typical books that are found in American Bibles, but also has important Apocrypha including translations from a Greek version of Esther which has excerpts from the royal archives. It has a small dictionary of biblical terms in the back which give insight on what the words mean in certain conditions. It also has a chronological chart of the Hebrew and Christian history from the beginning of time to John's death. It is very useful for leaning French, because if you have an English Bible, you can translate between them, giving you more insight."
1,The box lies!!,"I'm not reviewing the quality of these movies because they are great films, but the quality of the dvd itself. The dvd box claims a widescreen format for both movies. That is simply not true. When inserted into a dvd player, Maverick is the fullscreen version of the film, and therefore is insufficient for anyone with a widescreen tv. I'd swear they took this dvd straight from the VHS! The picture is grainy and blurry and makes it look like the film was made in 1950 instead of 1994! I've watched movies on youtube that look better. Great movies, but horrible dvd. Here's hoping they make a blu ray using the original source film."
4,nice pairing of movies,"The quality of the DVDs was good, as well as the packaging. These two movies are fun to watch for comedic westerns."
1,Fraud!,"I do not review DVDs for the movie itself because that is highly subjective; people's tastes vary. This review is for the quality of the DVD itself. The box claims that both movies are Widescreen but only the Wild, Wild West is. Maverick is full screen (the same aspect ratio as the old CRT TVs). This is out and out fraud and lying Warnervideo should be prosecuted for committing fraud (then shot)!"
1,My Box Lies Too,"Wish I'd looked at these reviews before I bought this thing.The box says Maverick is widescreen, but it's not, it's ""full screen"" (pan and scan)."
3,Nice pictures but not informative.,"While some makes and models of airliners have been covered redundantly in these types of books, this one is dedicated to smaller aircraft which makes it a unique and worthwhile purchase. What's missing here is adequate text documenting the history of the aircraft. For instance, there's an elaborate spread for the Fokker 100, with pictures of it in the livery of about a dozen airlines. However, all there is to read about it are brief captions for each picture which say little more than how many each airline has in its fleet. I realize that the primary appeal of these books are the pictures, but with other airliner books in my collection, I have also learned."
4,quite happy,I needed a generic housing to mount a sony car stereo in my boat. I had some difficulty finding something suitable online but eventually did find this. Ordered - it came quickly - and fit my needs exactly. easy to use and will adapt to most auto stereo systems.
3,A Nice Compilation But Mediocre to Poor Technicals,"I think it's great that they released DVD compilations of Olivia's many videos. They are a nice lasting tribute to this great singer. However, I'm a little disappointed at the effort invested in the project. The visual and audio quality of the videos are no better than VHS quality. And then there are the live tracks. They are out of place in this compilation of music videos. But more importantly, the quality is terrible. They are very grainy. This is surprising given the fact that there is a high quality DVD of this entire concert available for purchase.But I would still recommend this compilation for loyal Olivia Newton-John fans. Even though the quality is sub par, I think it is the best we are going to get. Every Olivia fan should have these videos."
4,CGW Comes Alive!,"I never had much interest in the CGW until this came out. Grant's analysis and historical perspective on this granger road make this book an excellent read. The business/strategy side of railroading is very evident in Grant's writing. There's not much left of the CGW today, but this book gives us a look at one of the midwest's less noted haulers."
5,"Detailed, accurate & excellent",In our homeschool co-op this book is being used for 1st-5th graders as we study the 1800's this year... it sets a wonderful background/tone for all we will be studying this year. I would recommend it freely for any age. I have enjoyed it as much as the children!
4,Great for the price.,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. You will definitely get your money's worth---an emerald only, say, 5% better would probably cost twice as much. That said, it's not a perfect stone (although emeralds are almost never ""perfect"").It's a really nice ring, if you've gotten yourself into trouble with your better half ;>, or just as a gift. But if you are looking for a 25th or 50th anniversiary gift, maybe kick it up a notch."
3,Some good ... some uninteresting,"I read this as part of an effort to read the entire U.S. Army Chief of Staff recommended reading list. It is on sublist 4, Brigade and higher. It is really a collection of essays organized in chronological order. As a collection, the quality of each essay depends on the individual authors. Some of the areas I just found uninteresting. For example the essay on the strategy development in the Weimer Republic did not seem to have much relevance or anything particulary illuminating. A couple of essays were interesting in that they covered areas you don't read much about like Chinese strategy in the empire periods or Spain's strategy under Philip II. For the most part, though, I had to force myself to finish this book."
1,Nice Charles... Nice,"I only read a few paragraphs and out of them bout 30% of the information is true. By the way, where's Janet's cut of the $20.95 per copy?? You also spelled my name wrong."
2,mailbox,"This product is pretty much what you would expect for the price. If someone really wanted in they would find a way but for everyday use I was pleased with it. The first day I went to get the mail I discovered a major flaw, the box is too shallow and I was able to reach my hand into the slot and take it out, if it was a few inches deeper I wouldn't be able to reach it. The other problem is that the slot is too small for larger items like magazines and they become left handing half way out the box. The box was fine if I wasn't interested in the locking function since it was useless except for very short letters."
4,Good overall energy bar,"I've tried all three flavors of Chocolate Chip, Cinnamon, and Fruit/Nut. None are particularly better than the others.Pros:> Overall nutritional value is good> Not heavy nor terribly light (I've been able to eat a bar and go running immediately afterwards.)> High protein for an energy bar (15g). Can be used as a protein barCons:> A little dryness in comparison to other protein/energy bars, but not much drier"
3,"Balance BARE Bar Trail Mix Bar, Cinnamon Oats and Honey, 1.76-Ounce Bars","Not very yummy. I didn't like the flavor of them. Didn't eat them very much so they expired and we had to throw them out. In my family of 3, no one like it. Very dry and bland flavor."
4,Some dancy music/ some chill music..(I liked it),"Not exactly what I was expecting from Aurora but it was still very good. Someone else had reviewed this cd somewhere else warning people that this was all ballad music. True, and not true. I would say its about half and half. Some songs have a dancy beat and others are ""chill out"" songs. So, if you like Aurora's stuff to begin with, you'll love it. If you're going into it blindly and expecting every song to be a dancefloor killer, think again."
1,NO SIR... DIDN'T LIKE IT,"I bought this cd by accident, cuz i liked the hear you calling trance remix which is good, but this album, awful. The only people interested in this music should be either a female or a male that is curious with his sexuality. Now to get rid of this from my collection, I have to give it a way to one of my girlfiends... I'm not saying don't buy it, i'm just saying ""CAREFUL""."
2,No so great,"I really didn't use this book too much... it was kinda hard to follow... no for beginners and no colors at all, boring"
1,Poor mechanical design,"When I first received the spray nozzle I was impressed. The handle is very comfortable and the different spray options worked well. At that time I would have given it a five star rating. A month later the shut of valve didn't work correctly and it would constantly leak. Then a week later the valve wouldn't turn so it only sprayed a little weak stream of water. I took it apart and opened the valve, so it is permanently on the on position. Then a week later the different spray options stopped working. I bet that next week the whole thing will fall apart. Don't waste your money on this product, your thumb on the end of the hose is a better tool."
2,Loved it at first,"The ergonomics are great. The on/off was snug. I awlays replace wahers and retape annnually so it was all fine. Now it won't turn off at all. This is a real shame because when I like a product I get quite a few and use them as ""favor"" re-payers when someone has helped out. These are not in that category any more. No way.I got 1 1/2 seasons out of mine - at best. Next stop is the transfer station."
2,"Good at first, but in the end a disappointment","This nozzle was great while it worked properly. After several weeks, it was no longer able to be shut off. Very disappointing."
1,Junk,Been through 3 of them and the lever that opens and closes the water flow breaks every time. Breaks..return to Lowes for another...Breaks...return to Lowes for another...Breaks.....I give up!!
1,Good looks aren't everything,"I was hooked. Good looking and a great bod! We were happy together but it started to be different when my hand became wet and cold. I knew we could work it out so I changed to a rubber washer to seal to the hose. Better, I thought, but when I dropped it to the ground after watering, the lever broke off. Still I would not give up on this beauty and fashioned a new lever from steel putty. We were happy again until I used it today. The plastic inner which the lever is fastened to broke off and with it I lost my love of this luscious bodied beauty which now lies at the bottom of the garbage can. A 10 month affair is over."
2,Lever Breaks EVERY time,"I have purchased this spray nozzle at least 5 different times over the past 3 years. Every single time the little lever that turns the water on and off breaks off. I love all the different patterns and the fact that you don't have to hold down a handle, but once the lever breaks, you can't turn the water on and off at the nozzle. Bummer they used such cheap metal on that part, otherwise I would love it."
2,"Not great, not good either...","I guess that's why it's not very expensive. I thought I could leave this massager on my leather office chair as a cushion and to provide some support for the cold surface. But the massage mechanisms aren't cushioned enough, they are these hard rectangles that you sit or lean on and they hurt. I used it once and now have moved to a wooden chair, which I thought would be inviting to people to sit on since the wooden chair is so uncomfortable. Same problem! I guess you can use it for punishment instead of relief!!"
3,Horrible Delivery Delay,"Obviously if overnight shipment is requested there is an urgent need. I had needed the book for a class that was offered abroad but not given sufficient time to order it. Five days before the trip we were told and I had ordered the book OVERNIGHT. However,it did not arrive before I had to leave the country. It took eight days therefore being incredibly useless and costing me twice as much for shipping (for something that didn't come in time) then for the book itself. I may never order from amazon again after this incident."
5,All the Answers,"I love this book! It is a terrific blend of hand-holding and concrete advice for writers. Each chapter takes the writer/reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write: How do we begin? Where do ideas come from? Is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin? I like the fact that I could use this book as a resource. In other words, I did not have to read it cover to cover. Rather, it truly serves as a guide, a mentor's guide, that can serve me as I continue to write. I really liked the movie section, where Cathleen Rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process. I found those sections inspirational and useful. If you want to be a writer or if you are already writing, I urge you to Buy this book!"
5,A Must for the Writer,"Cathleen Rountree,The Writer's mentor, A guide to putting passion on paperThis direct but friendly guide to the writer's practice is superbly organized and beautifully written. Rountree has balanced the practical with the inspirational. The structure of the book supports random browsing or a deliberate disciplined reading from cover to cover. This book asks meaningful questions that elicit your own solutions, and gives solid advise that helps create your own writing practice.The Writer's Mentor draws not only from Rountree's own experience but also incorporates the voices of many honored writers. This book is a must for the library of every aspiring and accomplished writer.--"
5,Good Company,"Writing is a lonely business. Thankfully, Cathleen's book provides the best kind of company--the Writer's Mentor is inspirational and directive without being preachy or overly simplistic. It is the next best thing to the real thing, Cathleen herself. Get it and use it if you want to finish your writing project."
2,Should have been better,"This is not at all what I expect from KK. I waited a while before reading this book and a week later I can't even remember character names. The rituals that are usually so wonderful and full of meaning fell short. The historical setting didn't add to this story as it did in _Lammas Night_, a book at least 10X better than this one. My advice is save your money and get TCfA out of the library if you feel you must read it."
1,Not on the level,"Proof that excellent research and the ability to put words together nicely doth not a good book make can be found herein. Kurtz seems to have forgotten the rule of ""show, don't tell,"" as much of the novel is descriptive summary of the progress of the Revolutionary war. Such few scenes as dramatize character development seem to have been cut-and-pasted from _Lammas Night_ and the Camber of Culdi novels. One can entertain oneself by matching the characters with characters in the Camber novels, but one might better spend one's time rereading those books and skipping this one."
2,"Different Battery, Works Intermittently","The battery is not the color shown in the picture. Anyway, I took the cover off using a hairdryer to heat the glue, and then pulling off the back cover. It's important to have the unit lying down when doing this, otherwise you could melt the screen. In my case the battery being replaced had a PCB with a wire sticking out, whereas the new battery just had a wire sticking out. Also the connector was slightly different. The first time I connected it, it did not work, but it's possible I just did not allow enough time in the charger because when I reconnected it doing nothing different, it worked. However after a few days, it stopped working again so I don't know what the issue is. In the end I ordered a replacement Palm from eBay, perhaps I was just unlucky with this particular battery since, as I said, it did work for several days, and worked well, but I just don't have the time to keep on taking the back off, which is not easy."
1,Garbage.,"In my opinion, you would be better off if you go out to your back yard, find a piece of dog dung, paint it blue, polish it, and put it on your rc car. I've tried a few Integy products, In every case...total garbage,I will never waste my money on Integy products again."
3,Great for kids with Special Needs,I purchased this lock from ebay for my son who has Cerebral Palsy and it works excellent for him at school. The only thing that isn't the best is the batteries don't last nearly as long as they state. I would like to purchase more and if anyone can help me locate who sells them or the company website I would greatly appreciate your time. When you childs fingers don't work so well and can't do a regular lock this is a great substitute.
1,what junk,stupid piece of junk i thought when i ordered it the remote was plastic but the LOCK itself is plastic i figured out it was plastic when i woke and went to get my bike and my biek was stolen and platic bit wher laying around then i saw the inside of the lock cheap flimsy plastic!!! DO NOT BUT THIS unless its for shuttign gates for your baby!
2,A little better than Sun's JMS Tutorial,"So, about the book. I had hoped to find suggestions as tohow to optimize JMS throughput. Chapter 7, ""Deployment Considerations"" should have provided some help.It asked more questions than it answered and offered nospecific solutions.Overall, I got a little more out of the book than I didreading [their] site and tutorial."
1,A specification Digest,"For me the book had little value. I would have been interested if it had offered some insight and/or examples into ways to set up a distributed system ( jms servers on two systems ) using various protocols. The examples and configurations discussed were the sames as those you would find at javasoft; nothing beyond a star configuration. JNDI is also a very important aspect of the JMS solution which was only thinly covered.There seems to be a whole series of these kind of books comming out of O'Reilly. Books that are similarly disappointing are the book on threads, beans and JDBC. Again each of these books fail to take the topic beyond the specification. O'Reilly does have some very fine books, especially the Nutshell books, but some just don't have value."
2,Lacks clarity and organization!,"The material in this book is so poorly organized that I had to visit javasoft.com for a much better introduction to JMS. The author has an interesting way of presenting his ideas. He starts out with code examples without clearly explaining the JMS concepts employed in them. The code examples are so lengthy that one is left flipping back and forth between pages correlating the explanation, which is very meagre and superficial, with the code snippets. The chat application implemented by the author, instead of clarifying the concepts, only adds to the confusion. Also chapters 7,8 and 9 are somewhat peripheral to JMS programming..."
5,"Wonderful, practical, useful","As someone who has participated in design and development of a commercially available JMS compliant messaging product I can wholehertedly reccommend this book as a starting point for anyone interested in MOM or JMS. It contains enough technical detail to be valuable for engineers and enough strategic information to be useful for managers interested in answering 'why' and 'how'.The best thing about this book is the balance it strikes between detail and generality. The authors do a great job of introducing the topics and describing the general JMS approach to dealing with it. Then they illustrate the concept using examples culled from specific industry implementations. The candid manner in which discrepencies beween vendor implementations, the JMS spec and the practicallity of developing something 'that works' makes this a very well-balanced read."
4,Good explanation for Integration of Spring and MQ Series,"I am look at Integration of Spring JMS and MQ Series. Author clearly explained Spring JMS , how the context factory and security credentials, connection factory, destination properties inject into JNDITemplate, JNDIObjectFactoryBean, JNDIDestinationResolver. Finally how all these object has reference to the JMSTemplate. Author clearly mentioned MQ specific native properties; he provided good explanation and example how do we connect to the MQ Series."
4,Decent Book,"As a beginner to JMS, I found this book to be very useful. Most chapters have examples and the book also gives you the link where you can download code for the examples. The examples are simple and clear for the most part (except in couple of places) to illustrate the concepts related to JMS. I tested the code on BEA Weblogic Server and it runs fine without any problem. There are some minor errors in one or two examples but they can be spotted readily once you read the book and you should be able to fix them with relative ease. Overall I found this book to be a nice introduction to JMS. However, as another reviewer mentioned, keep in mind that this book is now more than 5 years old and JMS has been updated since then. Still it is a good buy if you are new to this topic."
1,Husky Liners floor mat,"The mats they showed as designated for my 2006 Miata (item #51031) arrived today. As soon as I took them out of the box I knew there was a problem. They are not only too big, but are actually full-size truck mats. These are being returned to sender, and I'm going to have to try a different brand/company."
2,"Great cast, but disappointing screenplay","First, I love subtle movies that many others find too slow-moving, like Remains of the Day. This had an amazing cast, but the screenplay was just...lacking. Nothing much happens, and then the last 10 minutes try to get really dramatic. It is just not well-paced, and while I agree this is probably a (fairly) realistic movie in that not much happens, that's not why people go to the movies."
1,A great disappointment,"I am a great fan of Colin Firth. Even he could not redeem this film for me. For me, the plot,the characters, the writing, the lack of organization of the film and its camera work were fatal flaws. That a 10 year old would cover the eyes of the driver when the driver was driving 60 miles an hour down a busy highway is simply not believable. I found both children unsympathetic. The father seemed to let the girls do what they wanted with no supervision.I saw no sense of continuity in the film and it just seemed to stop at the end with no resolution after a series of disjointed episodes."
2,Disappointed,"As a long-time Colin Firth fan I looked forward to this film, but while his performance is dead on, the film was disappointing. Director Michael Winterbottom is more into being seen as an ""auteur"" than in creating a cohesive film. He thinks he is being naturalistic by not using any lighting, but the eye naturally captures more light than a camera lens does so several scenes are so dark it is difficult to tell who is talking in situations where this would not be true in real life. Don't expect the central mystery of the film to be resolved, that is apparently too low-brow for Mr. Winterbottom. To be fair, if you liked ""And When Was the Last Time You Saw Your Father,"" then you'll probably be moved by this one, too, But from my POV, it doesn't deliver both artistry & story like some of Mr, Firth's other films -- A Month in the Country, Apartment Zero, Trauma, The King's Speech, etc. -- it is more just art for its own sake."
3,"Slow, quiet drama","Very much a drama that will tug at your heartstrings. A family suffering a great loss moves to Italy and... well, copes. Not an uplifting story by any means but still an interesting one and if you're a Colin Firth fan, one you may like enough to see it (as I did). For those like me who like seeing scenes of 'how they live' in other countries, this movie gives an impression of what it might be like to live in such a place. There's not a lot of action or an end really to this film, it's dark, sad, and slow, it has it's moments. If you're into quiet dramas that make you feel, think, then you may find this worth your time. The acting alone keeps it from being a bad movie. It's just good to know what you're getting into beforehand."
2,disappointed,I am colin Firth fan..so I buy and watch every one of his movie..Learnt a lesson that not every movie..he acts well...this is a rather boring movie and disappointing acting by colin
2,Dark and slow,"I'm probably going to get negative votes for stating my opinion here, but I must tell you the truth. So here goes...(remember I told you so).If for some reason you wish to be depressed, watch this movie. If you like watching paint dry, watch this movie. If you like watching people walking, watch this movie. If you like watching people watching other people, watch this movie. It is very dark, and extremely slow. I did NOT find it beautiful at all...in any form. I wish I had not wasted our hard earned money on this one.I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the acting performance by the younger sister in the movie. I would, otherwise, have given it 1 star."
4,Great performance from Colin Firth!,"To read my full review, you can look at it here on my blog: http://netflixandnutella.com/2012/08/06/a-summer-in-genoa/All in all, I thought Firth portrayed the widower superbly and his relationship with the two girls who played his daughters seemed genuine."
4,Subtle and stirring,"I enjoyed this quiet movie. I agree with the reviewer who called it ""meditative."" There was a plot but, rather than being propelled by action scenes and extensive dialogue, it was moved along by the viewer's empathy and identification with the characters. I was especially affected by the performances of Colin Firth and Perla Haney-Jardine (a natural as the young daughter, Mary).The movie was set in Genoa, a character in its own right. The street scenes (with noises and passers-by and narrow alleyways and chaotic traffic) depicted authentic Italy, not the sentimentalized and artificial Italy of most American movies."
3,not good enough to see twice,Clin First is good no matter if the movie is not. He was good in this movie but the script did not hold my interest.
5,"Funny,wise, philosophical,a novel about childhood in the 50s","Who but Eric Kraft could write a novel about diffusion?""Where do you stop?"" is the question assigned to 11-year-old Peter LeRoy by his science teacher as the molecules ofher perfume pervade the room. The image of diffusion per-vades the novel, from Peter's childhood memory of mixingpeas and mashed potatoes, to racial intergration in thefictional community of Babbington. Memory itself is aseries of vignettes suspended in the ""Zwischenraum"" oftime. And of course we can't really tell where one of Mr.Kraft's novels stops and the next one begins as hechronicles Peter's life.The story (""to be continued"") is told with Mr. Kraft'susual humor and digressiveness. We learn more aboutBabbington of the 1950s, clam capital of the world, andcatch Peter at a time between childhood and awakeningsexuality (that perfume). Grandpa Herb, the Studebakersalesman, makes another great invention, an automaticgarden sprinkler."
3,A story of conflict between the Welsh and English invaders.,"Josselyn is a spirited, fiercely patriotic young Welsh heiress. Rand is an English nobleman sent to conquer and subdue the Welsh for the English king. Each fights against their attraction for each other because of their nationalistic origins.I purchased this book because it was highly recommended by Romantic Times Magazine. However, I was disappointed. The romance angle was overshadowed by the hatred and frequent betrayals. Rand was portrayed as such a tough, unfeeling conqueror that it just didn't seem possible that he would fall in love with anyone, let alone a Welsh girl as patriotic as Josselyn. Sexual attraction, yes. Love, no. On Josselyn's part, falling in love seemed to be a result of their sexual encounters more than anything else. Maybe such a thing might happen to an ordinary woman, but not a strong, spirited young miss like Josselyn. This book could use a lot more romance and a lot less hatred and betrayal."
5,Fantastic!,"Ms. Becnel is in top form with this wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. The conflict between Rand and Josslyn kept me on the edge of my seat. How can two enemies ever fall in love? They fight their feelings, but love does win in the end. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
3,Tedious Reading,"""The Mistress of Rosecliffe"" was the third of the triology I read first, and to my surprise it was a very good book. ""The Bride of Rosecliffe"" however was a tedious read; overwritten, convoluted, the ending was weak, and I basically had to drag myself to finish the book."
2,the bride of rosecliffe,"This book is not up to par with the author's usual work, in my opinion. The romance was buried beneath too much conflict, unhappiness, and lack of chemistry (other than sexual) between Rand and Josselyn. It was not uplifting, had no humour, and was so depressing that the quick resolution at the end was too little, too late."
2,I agree completely with another reviewer.,"""A story of conflict between the Welsh and English invaders."" This reviewer described this book to a ""T."" I can't describe it better, so read her review. I however didn't enjoy it as much as she did. I would really give it only a 1 1/2*"
3,Not Up To Par With Her Best,"Having been highly impressed by most of Rexanne Becnel's previous novels, I felt that ""The Bride of Rosecliff"" was a fine read but somewhat lacking. Maybe it was the fact that this book was more depressing and violent than the others. Once I had reached the end, I was actually glad that it was over and the main characters had been relieved of their heavy emotional burdens. Somehow, I don't find myself anticipating the next book in the series a great deal."
3,NOT a Helms manual,Now I know why serious bikers tell you to get a Helms manual. This one is more like an owners than a workshop manual.
3,It was alright.,"I enjoyed the series. The videos were alright. The later shows were the best. I really enjoyed the extras. I was hoping to see the episodes uncut. I was hoping to see more of the bloopers, that I know had to happen on the show. I was also disappointed not to be able to see the episodes unedited. I know that some people cannot tolerate the strong language but that is what I was looking for. I am waiting for them to release some footage from later on in the series."
1,Background noise,"I bought these videos and I have extreme background noise...If I turn the sound down, to where I can't hear it...it goes away. Not impressed!"
2,Whose Line Uncensored review,"Bought the multi-set DVD of Whose Line Is It because we enjoyed the show and thought the uncensored version probably had some funny and interesting things not seen on TV. Disappointed. Although still funny, uncensored barely added anything. Should have saved the money and taped the series."
5,Extremely Hilarious!,"I will say that I do not understand why they have taken so long to put out this series on DVD!!! ""Who's Line Is it Anyways?"" is a very funny show with talented comedians and fun for the whole family. I enjoyed the show while on TV and I enjoyed it again on DVD. This is a MUST-HAVE!"
1,BAD MOVIE ALERT,THIS IS PITIFUL! IN 2000 DISNEY HAD SOME OF THE BEST DCO(DISNEY CHANNEL ORIGINAL) MOVIES BUT THIS? WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON?
2,Disappointing,"Yes the pictures are nice, but I was not impressed with the ideas or information. All the ideas are for modern homes. The summary said it provided ideas for the way we live today - I expected ideas for all styles."
5,Classic Esteban,"This CD has some of the best early tracks I have come across. Some of the best accordian licks of all time can be found on #12 ""Estrellita del norte""."
1,CAN YOU PLEASE HIRE PEOPLE WHO CAN READ?????,"AMAZON.COM.....I ORDERED THESE BARS TWICE..AND BOTH TIMES...ONE TIME WAS A REPLACEMENT ORDER ON THE FIRST ONES....BOTH TIMES...BOTH TIMES...EXPIRATION DATE WAS JAN 2, 2006???DIDN'T GET EITHER ORDER UNTIL 2 WEEKS AND 3 WEEKS AFTER THIS...NOW, I GUESS SINCE YOU SENT ME ONE ORDER BACK....YOU ARE NOT RESPONDING TO MY COMPLAINT????JUST BE CAREFUL IF YOU WANT FRESH BARS OF ANY TYPE FROM AMAZON.COM..AS I HAVE SINCE READ COMPLAINTS FROM BUYERS ABOUTOTHER BARS!!!!!"
4,Balance Trail Mix Convert,"I recently tried these and was pleasantly surprised at the taste. I can't stand balance bars usually; they have a funny taste to them. These reminded me of good granola. Not too sweet, nice and crunchy, with a bit of salty snap as well. Also, very happy at the lack of artificial sweeteners. It's nice to see something more natural with a high protein content. A satisfied customer."
3,Luck of the Irish,"Bought it as a birthday gift. If you like basketball and good family entertainment, give it a look."
2,"Cute concept, corny plot, bad dancing!","This movie does have its redeeming qualities. It's a cute concept, and kids will eat it up. It does tend to take Irish culture and ""cute"" it up - using all of the corny usuals - but that's Disney! ;) And even though some of the accents could use work, it's not that bad. I taped it off of Disney, so it's not worth buying to me, so I couldn't speak on it's worth. The worst part of it was the dancing - ack! I couldn't stand it. Outside of the troupe dancers at the faire, the rest of the cast couldn't dance to save their souls. It looks more like bad tap dancing mixed with Lord of the Dance than Irish dancing.So to end, it IS a cute movie - and even fun for those Irish culture nitpicks out there like me (we'll have a field day with it)! But Ryan Merriman and Seamus (that actor is now in Judging Amy and will forever look like a leprechaun to me) is in DIRE need of dance lessons."
1,WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,we purchased 4 airsoft guns from this company today. As soon as we got them we tried to shoot them. 3 of them were broken (for different reasons). We live locally and took them back to the store within minutes. They would not refund us and when given exchange cheated us out of over $10 on the price of one gun. Their guns are extremely cheap made and the customer service (gag) was horrible. PLEASE do yourself a favor and go look elsewhere. Not NetLink Ent or Fun Guns n Toys on Ebay.
2,Don't buy,"This gun worked for about a month but now it broken. I've tried fixing it but it's not possible, otherwise it was a power and nice pistol. Also the scope and the laser don't work."
3,Rinérse '- Machine Pour Les Oreilles,"Rinérse lets the MACHINE POUR LES OREILLES do its work: the mellow breaks of ""Whawhaou"" soon give way to dense bass throbs and house beats, and the percussive elements of ""Metal Mental Dub"" give it that song's slower tempo a more 'live' feel even as the more electronic elements find their way in. The title track itself takes a similar pace, though the layers of guitar and feedback are heavier. And the great ""La Guitaristic House Organisation"" (which appears on their album INSTALLATION SONORE) brings things back to house level. A good introduction to Rinérse."
4,ERHU at its FINEST,Yu Hong-Mei once again displays her beautiful skills on the Erhu. This CD is soft and elegant just like her other CD here on Amazon.The music is slow and relaxing. It is nice to listen to on a lazy Sunday afternoon or when laying back and reading a good book. I recommend her music and this CD to those who love ALL MUSIC.
5,"Great information, great writing","This book is informative and entertaining, with specific legal information every entreprenuer, ceo needs to know about intellectual property"
5,A Wonderful Resource!,"A great not-so technical, technical book that provides real insight into this process."
4,Practical and Helpful,"A practical guide to legal rules about protecting your intellectual property (IP). If your business relies significantly on IP to generate value, you may find that you can use your legal counsel better after reading this book."
5,Informative and entertaining!,"As a sales engineer for a software company, I often get involved in contract negotiations and issues surrounding copyrights, licensing and trade secrets. I initially picked up this book to use as a reference guide on these topics. When I began scanning through it, however, I got drawn further and further in between the covers. The book is well organized and is fun and easy to read/understand for a non-technical person like me. It covers recent and relevant information and provides tons of interesting examples, special notes and reference footnotes. I found it extremely informative and very entertaining."
5,Extremely Informative,"I am currently using this book as text in one of my undergraduate college courses (Literary Criticism).Excellent selected essays, with great abstracts/introductions at the beginning of each. They give historical background, both about the author and the school from which the author comes, often a introduction to the terminology used, and a concise summary of the author's argument."
4,Good Text Book,"I bought this book and used it as a textbook a few years ago for my Literary Criticism class in college. I have really enjoyed reading it. The book is well pieced together; the individual articles/essays are well written and concise, for the most part. Even if you are not planning on using it for school purposes it is a good book for those wishing to have a better understanding of literature. I have used it several times as a reference since graduation and occasional will read one of the essays just for fun. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are a few articles that are not to my liking, a little too wordy with not much substance. However, that is not the norm for the book as a whole. Overall, if you need it for a class, or are a literature buff, it's a good buy."
3,Nothing to differentiate this joke book from others for children,"Igor and Elinor are two monsters that have abdomens that look like pineapples, barbed tails, big eyes, teeth like the edges of a tree saw, bulbous noses, and a silly sense of humor. They tell jokes to each other with their facial expressions and body language serving to accent the joke. However, the jokes are primarily those that have been recycled through many different children's joke books. Examples are:*) Look, Igor, the train just left the station. I know, I can see its' tracks.*) May I hold your hand? No thanks, it isn't that heavy.*) I wonder what makes humming birds hum? They don't know the words?*) Why is it bad to write on an empty stomach? Because paper is easier.When my daughter was younger, I used to get joke books for her and these were found in many of those books. Therefore, there is nothing to differentiate this book from other joke books written for children."
1,very poor quality,This was a big disappointment. It claims to be digitally remastered but we would disagree! Picture and sound quality were extremely poor. We have old programs recorded directly from the TV that is better in quality. We hope someone else will pick-up the series and do a better job at remastering.I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,The Men from Shiloh,"I was very disappointed. I love the show ""The Virginian"" and this was nothing like it. The first show was somewhat about the ranch and the owner and the next ones had nothing to do with the ranch and the people on it.I returned it and was only given 1/2 of my money back. Very dissatisfied!!!"
5,The Way Rap Should be!,"I was first introduced to Paris' music back in the old college days in 1992 when he released "" Sleeping With the Enemy"" and have been a fan ever since! The thing that I remember most was the powerful video of the song ""the days of old"". I also remember when Paris did "" outta my life"" in 94 and the subsequent video that was released. Well all I can say is that rap is so deplorable nowadays as everyone is bling-blinging, drinking 40's, or throwing gang signs that it is great that there are still heroes out there like Paris, Public Enemy, KRS One, that take us back to the days of old when rap was wonderful and had intelligence and meaning unlike today's rap with a c infront of it CRAP! Awesome Album! Thanks Paris!"
4,one of the most slept on Artists,Paris comes back strong on this set&a welcome Comeback.this Album makes no Apologys for Subject matter&paris just brings it you un-cut&straight to the point.good Production&the Lyrics are on point&time.
4,WOW - rap MUSIC with a REAL Message! Who knew?,"America:Listen to this and listen to Alex Jones: Wake up call!Of course this artist is marginalized, this must scare alot of people. This rap CD is probably the only rap CD that I would recommend (aside fro Public Enemy and MC 900FT Jesus). Buy it."
4,Cheese knives,"We love these knives - we use them mostly when we entertain, for butter or spreads. The handles give them a modern look."
1,Terrible!!!!!,This is a horrible product. Pieces began breaking on it before I even finished putting it together. Poorly made!
5,Excellent,"Solid wood, not veneer. Clever design. After reading other reviews, I was prepared for the worst, but assembly was easy. I did use some wood glue on the base joint, which probably improves stability. All parts fit. I would recommend it unless one needs a heavy duty frequent transport between rooms or especially heavy load bearing cart. This one fits in with furniture, supports my laptop and meals, which is why I bought it."
2,Not worth to Purchase,"The quality is good, but overall not cofertable to use and its fixture is very bad and borken in 15 days after purchase.........no reply from company regarding warranty and emails wrriten to them..........."
3,TabletopReview,"The laptop table is okay for low usage; however, it is not conducive to daily use. For me, the table is too small because I conduct a great deal of class work, each day. I would recommend it for low usage laptop users."
4,maptop cart,"I am very happy with this product. One should be aware that the retainer rail on the leading edge of the table top can interfere with cables and cords connecting the the rear of a laptop and to switches and volume control on the leading edge of the laptop's keyboard. Other than that, a quality product and quite sturdy. The tilt knob is cheap and broke on the 3rd time I tightened it, but it still holds the table at the tilt I want."
1,Bought 2. Put one together and it fell apart in a week.,Bought 2. Put one together and it fell apart in a week. The second one is still sitting in the box it came in. I will never buy from this Amazon vendor again. When I have time I will try to get my money back. I wish I could have rated it no stars.
4,winsome Wood Laptop Table,"I bought the table for my wife to do her homework. The table was easy to assemble but is a little unstable,"
5,Laptop table,I have been using it for 4 days now and it's wonderful. nice wood and it was easy to put together.
3,wood table,at first it was perfect-love the color but then the screw strippped and we can not adjust it tio any height-tried tying it but it did not work so unless you want it one height I suggest a different one
1,Poor workmanship,"Seemed like it would be the perfect portable desk, but the workmanship was poor. The item was unstable (hard to type on a slanted, rattling surface!). Great in theory, nice looking, but ultimately unusable."
1,Wibble Wobble,"Not over joyed with my Wibble Wobble computer come meal tray. I put my printer on it n it took of when it started to print pluss it started to lean to one side. Also it cost more to deliver it then the stand, i was't told how much the delivery was untill after. ""Not happy Jan""."
1,Nice but...,The cart is made of beautiful sturdy wood. It looks beautiful but I have had nothing but problems with the adjustment features.The Tilting Brace that allows you to adjust the tilt of the top tray has a plastic knob that snapped the first time I tried to tighten it. The vertical support has a cute little wooden knob that when I tried to raise the tray the knob screwed rigt off! I will now have to figure out a way to remove the screw that is stuck in the vertical support and try to glue the knob back on.Another concern was the fact that when assembled it was not level...and it was not close to level. It felt like I had to sit at an angle in order to use my laptop.I have only owned this cart for 6 days and if I didn't discard the carton I would return it for a refund.This cart is beautiful and would probably suffice if you didn't want to adjust the tilt or height very often.
2,Shoddy goods,"As others have said, the wood is nice but that's where it stops.The finish is splotchy, the platforms weren't level, the movable platform interfered with the fixed platform, the height adjustment assembly was assembled incorrectly, and when I woke up the next day, the angle adjustment bracket had snapped and the adjustable shelf had dropped down and couldn't be fixed.Service is less than wonderful, too, as I have had no response to three different communications to them.I did like the wood, though, and spent another $25 to get a brass lid support (from another supplier) to replace the angle adjustment bracket and am using the desk as I write this. It's smaller and better looking (now) than the honking-metal-and-pressboard table I previously owned."
1,Don't bother with this item,"I must say that I should have read the reviews before purchasing the table. I bought it for my wife who had surgery and was going to be bed ridden for a couple of weeks. It was put together easily, and I was happy about it even though it seemed to be a bit unstable when extended to bed height, but I could live with that. What I could not live with was when the plastic part holding the slide adjustment broke. I tried to contact The Winsome CO. to inquire if I could purchase a replacement part. They have not contacted me back. I percieve their attitude to be of We have your money too bad for you now. Buyer Beware!!! Not worth even the $69.99 discounted price."
1,Winsome Wood terrible construction,"This product was not made well... to say the least. First, it was supposed to be adjustable but the screw wasn't the right size. I had to actually cut down the wood with a saw to make it adjustable. Part of the table was supposed to tilt. However, it wouldn't hold a tilt because the plastic housing containing the screw was stripped. I had to bolt it on which just took away the tilt ability. I honestly think it was the worst product I have ever purchased."
5,Great Huayno album,"I have traveled in Peru and picked up a taste for Huayno music. This album is an excellent selection of the genre and evokes the popular music that bridges two cultures. When you hear it there is no doubt that this is not a European or North American sound, but I for one am drawn to the spectrum of sadness, celebration, and trans-cultural originality. It's not for everyone, but if you like some of the snippets you can access, you will be enthralled by the album."
5,"Wonderful, hilarious satire","This book is the perfect afternoon read. It's a satirical take on Westerns with a dose of dark fantasy and magical surrealism. The main character is wistfully saved by the ""vicious Crawler Gang. A group of renegade hermaphrodites that have been terrorizing innocent farmers and councilmen, wreaking havoc from the silver coast to the end of the world."" One member of which is an incredibly charismatic snake skinned nymphomanic with stegosaurus spikes and blades that come out of her skin who can tell your future from having sex. And that is just the first two pages. This book is full of suprising and imaginative details that make it highly entertaining and fun. The style is fast paced and fun. For me, this book is how I'd see Shinya Tsukamoto directing a Spaghetti Western."
5,It's Loctite,The title almost says it all. Bought three grades and all three are perfect for the specified jobs. I would buy again when I run out.
3,"A victory for Mustafa Kemal, actually","Almost everything mentioned within this book have been noted somewhere else. Haythornthwaite did a good job of putting it altogether and made our life easier to read it in one piece.Above else it shows that Mustafa Kemal, loved by some and hated by others, actually gain the most out of this disasterous ANZAC's campaign. He ascended to power only to liquidize the 'last'/'only' Khilafah that the Muslim had by 1924. You'll be amazed and wondered whether the whole thing was a 'setup' to break the Ottoman Devlet from the inside.In the end the Ottoman lost the whole war by alligning to the wrong side (Central Powers) in that pitiful World War I."
2,A too factual description of the campaign,"This book is hard to read and way too factual - always talking about this regiment and this battalion moving this many yards and then joining with that other regiment, etc. It is very hard to get a feeling of the battles that took place and the immensity of the human suffering this campaign caused. It is utterly missing drama and emotion.In addition, despite all that verbal detail, the maps are not detailed enough - making them hard to follow against the written details.In short, this book is not easy to read and - Alan Moorehead's book makes a better job doing that."
3,Good information but could be presented better,"Having been a Network Analyst since 1985, I have seen and done most everything Nassar describes in this book. Still it is nice to see good methodology codified in print. I found Nassar's writing style to be very laborious. Nassar uses 20 words when 5 would do and tends to repeat himself often. The first six chapters are the methodology part and could have been shortened to about 1/3rd as long if Nassar was better with technical prose. The last six chapters are a rehash of material that has been thoroughly presented in many other texts and I wonder why he felt the need to include it here. The best parts of these Chapters were the case studies. Overall, the book is worth having and a worthwhile best practices/methodology reference. However, you have to work at digging out the methodology from his verbose prose."
1,frickin' awful,"This is possibly the worst CD I have ever owned. I ordered it because I thought it might be worthwhile, subsidiary of warp and so on but it is NOT. I took it in and traded it in the same day I got it in the mail."
5,LOVE IT,"I HAVE ORDERED OTHER ITEMS FROM TREND LAB AND LOVE THEM. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE SOMETHING THAT WOULD JUMP OFF THE PAGES AT ME AND ONCE I FOUND THIS I DIDNT THINK TWICE ABOUT PURCHASING. I SENT A PIC TO MY HUSBAND AND HE AGREED THAT IT WAS THE PRETTIEST THAT WE HAD FOUND. ONCE WE GOT IT AND WASHED THE ITEMS AND GOT THEM ON THE BED, I WAS SO HAPPY I CRIED. :)"
3,MISSING ITEMS IN PACKAGE!!!!,"According to the indicated package I was to receive coverlet, bumpers, sheet and skirt. I did NOT receive the sheet for the mattress. Although I do love the colors and pattern of the set I am a little upset that I spent so much and did not get what I was told I was going to get. :("
2,save your money,"I bought this bedding for my daughter after finding this set online. Online I thought this set looked adorable. When I received the set I was very disappointed by the quality of the bedding. The blanket is paper thin and the brown started to bleed into the pink when a little bit of my daughters milk dripped on it.Over all, it looks cute, I guess. However if I were to see this set in person I never would have paid the money for it."
3,Bumpers too big,"The blanket, bed skirt and sheet look beautiful but the bumpers are too long and don't properly fit sides of the crib."
4,Love It!,"This is so adorable, and it doesn't stand out to much. The blues within this set are very calming, and the soft material is perfect. The only bad thing I've noticed is the bumper which is a little short from the corners of the crib, but it's hard to notice. Other than that it is wonderful! Worth the money!"
2,No what I was expecting,The material was not what I was hoping it would be. It seemed cheaply made. I felt that some of the fabric/ squares I would have to wash a few times in order to get it soft enough to put against my baby's skin. Wasn't really impressed.
5,Good ideas for girls,"I liked this book because it had projects that girls can make for their dolls that were easy to do, but not what you might think of yourself. The illustrations were cute, too!"
3,ok,"The book wasn't exactly what I was expecting. However, there were a few things I will make from it."
4,From a Zalman King collector.,"Okay, I don't fit the male stereotype; I like both eye candy and mind candy.In the first of the three stories here, Written Word, a female law professor has designs on a male student. A bit too much mind candy.In the second, Borders of Salt, a man and a woman meet on a train. The conversation and the action that follows make it my favorite of these three.The third, Girl on a Bike, takes place in Paris. Almost enough said. The words ""sweetly romantic"" are not in my usual vocabulary but they fit much of this story. So do the words ""a terrific contest of wills."" For me a sour note comes at the end when ""bad"" (a woman valuing and pursuing her own happiness) is punished and ""good"" (a woman agreeing to fit herself into traditional expectations) would have been rewarded. Stop the video when she leaves the room and you will be spared this scene."
1,Horrible 80's trash,These episodes are laughable to think people seriously believed the corny plots/acting/and set are hot in any sense. There is no turn on here... then what else do you value in the Red Shoe Diaries? Your time not watching it.
1,One word to describe this book: ripoff!,"The book claims you can build all projects with standard components. However, every project contains at least one component that can only be ordered on the website of the author! No details about those components is provided to force you to buy it in his shop and make it almost impossible to find it somewhere else. Also, the claim that all projects can be built for less than 100$ is an outright lie! Most projects are very expensive.I can be very brief about this book. Don't buy it! It's just an advertisement folder for his own company disguised as a book. Besides, every project in it can be found in one form or another on the internet for free."
2,Giant commercial...,"Meh, I had high hopes for this book, I really did.Some of the projects are really interesting, but as it's been pointed out many times before the whole thing is just a book of plans from his website. Every single project requires at least one (often many more) special part that can only be order for an arm and a leg. Expect to spend several hundred dollars for the cheaper things.I did learn a lot, and aside from his special parts everything else is clearly labeled and listed, so the book is far from a waste. Anyone reading this type of book should have enough of a background to be able to replace with their own cheaper components.I did enjoy it as a good read, but please Mr. Iannini: lay off milking people from your site so much."
1,"Arcane, overpriced parts with vague descriptions needed. ""Information Limited""","I got this book for my birthday, glancing through the pages it seemed full of exciting projects to build. My enthusiasm wore off once I started building the projects. Although most of the parts in the ""Bill of Materials"" are easy to obtain there are some _critical_ parts required for the completion of the project. The book contains vague descriptions of arcane parts that can only be obtained through the authors web site. Alas, overpriced in my opinion. A good book in my opinion wold list part numbers and various sources so the reader has a choice. I have found the cost ""estimates"" ridiculous, in a particular project just two of the ""special"" parts needed are more than the ""estimate"" for the full project. Not to mention that you can only get them through the authors website. In my opinion one of the reviewers that called this book ""an infomercial"" for the authors website was right on.Thank you for reading."
2,Easy to read but expensive to build,M Iannini claims many of these projects can be built for under $100 but that isn't true. His laser based projects can run into the hundreds of dollars because the specialized parts are not easy to find. I am on the fence about whether or not I will hold onto this book.
4,A good book but don't try building anything unless you know what you're doing,"The projects described in this book are if nothing else very interesting. However, outside of science demonstrations I don't think most people will find the gadgets described in this book very useful. But if you are a hobbyist with a penchant for high voltage devices and lasers then this book is loaded with great ideas and information. Yes, the author does advertise his online store quite often throughout the book, but to be fair some of the required components are difficult to find and/or modify. Also, unless you really enjoy PCB design and layout, purchasing the PCBs from the author's store is a huge time saver. As others have stated, a good number of these projects can get either you or someone else seriously hurt or even killed. If you are unfamiliar with how to handle high voltages, controlled expolosions and high powered lasers, then please do not attempt to build any of these projects."
2,Electronic Gadget Book,"Although this book has excellent design features (schematics, pictures,notes and a numbered assembly list), however, I was not impressed with some of the items to build. such as Electrokinetic gun,fish stun gun, magnetic can crusher. This book would be geat as a sciencepoject book, for kids! wb"
5,practical excellence,"I have read many books in my past carreer of 23 years as a high voltage expert and a nuclear specialist.reading the book was like seeing and doing things in the laboratory.extremeley practical very easy and excellent book for the advanced beginners agood book for higher class students also my warm wishes to the author,publisher and ofcourse amazon.com"
2,Easy to read...Hard to build...,Yes it's a good (not very) book...but isn't the best...Unfortunatly Mr. Iannini guesses that every one has the chance to get all the necessary materials to build the electronic gadgets...but in fact it cost a lot of money to build the gadgets he describes. There is a lot of more intelligent books to chose from. Don't waste your money.
1,interesting ideas - but author ruins book trying to make a quick buck,the projects could have been designed / described using widely-available parts - but instead they all direct you back to the author's website to purchase the required (proprietary) components.to make sure you don't buy the parts someplace else - he also leaves out detailed descriptions of the said items - which really detracts from the value of the plans in the first place.interesting ideas - and can be fun the thumb through.however - if you're really interested in building this stuff - this is not the place to start.
4,Gift,I thought it was a good book for my grandsons. It is a gift but I have not given it as yet. I think they will spend many happy times trying the experiments.
1,not worth the box it comes in,"(Amazon made me give it a rating - otherwise this product would get no stars)I bought this at a local Target store to try and make a video slideshow of an event to be shown on a dvd player. Tried for a half hour, and gave up. Reading some of the other reviews, I'm not alone, so I don't feel so bad."
5,Wow!,"A changed from a Valentine One to this, and I am speechless. Makes Valentine One look like a child's toy. This detector, detects EVERYTHING! Completely remarkable! Recommended over anything! You can't go wrong!"
5,Great product For Virginia,"Have had one for a few years, got this one to give as a gift. it is very effective and invisible to police which is important in VA. Needed service after warranty, service was fast and cheap, very professional.The STI Driver has been replaced by STI Magnum, same unit apparently, says its improved but I dont know how it could get any better. Got a great deal on the Driver.The fact that I bought another one for my brother says it all - its a great detector."
1,Very Disappointed,"Wanted another Beltronics ever since my old one went on the blink after a few years of use. Thought we purchased one of the best units on the market. What a disappointment!Specifically wanted it for a planned road trip to FL. The STi unit arrived the day before we were to leave, so we were not able to test it ahead of time.During our trip we were anxious to test the new unit. After a few miles on the road, the unit alarmed other than for the usual alets. When investigated in the manual,it noted that the unit's quality control was not good, and the unit should be sent back to the manufacturer.What an annoyance to turn off the unit an turn it on every few miles until the alarm once again sounded. Of course we sent the unit back the first chance we got after arriving home from our trip.Am very hesitant to buy another Beltronics radar detector if that's the best quality control they can produce.Beltronics STi Driver Radar Detector (Black/Silver)"
1,Will Not Honor WARRANTY Claims from Amazon.com,"My Radar detector was purchased January 2010. One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site. I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product."
1,PATHETIC,When you pay this much $$ for a radar detector you expect to be able to use it directly out of the box. It comes with one VERY cheap windshield mount that I could not get to work in any one of my two cars or my pickup. When I contacted Beltronics I was given a website where i could buy more mounts. During my research I found out that Beltronics = Escort too... despite all the hype and competing products they are sister companies. Escort packs the same cheap mount I was told.... I remember buying a piece of junk whistler that came with a few mounts....Sorry but in my opinion if you are buying their top of the line unit there should be multiple mounts included NOT for an additiona $29.95!!I tried holding the unit while I drove what a pain and it was getting lots of erroneous errors or ghost hits there were no bridges or buildings or other cars on the road yet my KA band kept going off.... no thanks.
5,Awesome... totally Awesome!,"All I can say is that this Radar Detector does an incredible job of protection... Already traveled about 1800 miles, at times up to 120 MPH+ and all potential tickets avoided. Of course you have to watch for the occasional trigger happy radar user when you are on a ""lonely"" road (you're on your own in that case)! Flawless product in my opinion!"
5,Excellence in Performance and Stealth!,"I am extremely impressed with the product. It lives up to it's assertion of early detection and stealth. It is well designed, user friendly, and sturdily constructed. I would recommend this radar detector to all of my friends."
4,Almost heaven,"The unit seems to work fine. However, be prepared to find some way other than the supplied suction cups to mount it. The suction cups lost their shape and will no longer stick to the windshield.The fancy carrying case is totally useless, and I doubt that many people would want to use the external speaker. I believe that these items should be offered as optional accessories rather than being included with the detector. This would substantially reduce the price of the detector."
5,"Convenient, easy to understand, something for everyone!","I am very impressed with this training fan. It's compact, so you truly can bring it anywhere you choose to go. If you don't have room in your suitcase for free weights (too heavy, or what have you), that's okay because there is an ""equipment-free"" workout outlined in this ""fan"". How awesome is that? Of course, if you have a little extra room in the 'ol Samsonite, you might want to throw in an exercise band or two. There are outlined exercises for those, too! Oh yeah, and if you are near a gym, bring this little thing with ya...there are exercises and a full routine explained in this fan. Yes, this truly is the mother of all strength training workout guides. What a unique gift to give the exercise ethusiast, too!!!"
1,Of No Help,This product did not help me whatsoever. I did not notice any difference. Buy this product @ your own risk!
4,My metabolism kicked it up a gear.....,"This is a successful product to take. At first my appetite increased a bit, which frightened me, so I ate ""extra light and healthy"". Smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. I had an increase in energy, enough to get me to the healthclub after an hour commute from work 5 days a week but I only exercise 4 days a week. I alternate tennis, swimming and speed walking.The pounds are shedding and I truly feel this product has helped me."
3,I like Thyrotril so far,I have a very inactive thyroid. I am very strict with my diet but I don't have the time to exercise. Thyrotril worked wonders for my sister-in-law. and hopefully it will do the same for me.
4,I feel a big difference in my metabolism,"I had a slow metabolism, my family physician put me on a well balanced diet and recommended I try Thyrotril to help me speed up my metabolism. I have lost weight AND have an increase in energy. I haven't felt this good in a very long time. I am thankful for my physicians advice."
5,Works Great,"I bought Thyrotril after both my mom and sister were diagnosed with under active thyroids. I began a year ago gaining weight and no matter how little I ate or how much I worked out, it would not come off. There were times I felt like I was hardly eating and working out like crazy and I was gaining and not losing weight. I was always tired and felt sluggish. I was almost ready to give up!!! Since under active thyroids are common in my family, I decided to try Thyrotril. OMG am I happy I did. I havent felt this good about my body is a very long time. I have been eating my normal diet (which is healthy) and working out as I was before, and FINALLY my weight is falling off. I am wearing jeans I havent been able to wear in over a year. I no longer feel tired all the time and have enough energy to get me through my day. My only bad comment is that I didnt find this sooner."
4,fatique reliever,"It doesn't look like there had been a recent review on Thyrotril for quite some time so I thought I would give an current review.I have hypothyroidism and my fatigue level has been getting to me. I researched thyroid enhancing products and saw this one. I researched the ingredients very carefully and satisfied with what I saw I ordered it.I have been taking this product for two or three weeks. I did not buy this to lose weight, although it would be an added benefit if it did.I was hoping to increase my metabolism and lose the fatigue. I am taking half the recommended dose since I am already taking thyroid replacement medication and wanted to proceed with caution.I have had no adverse effects only a general lifting of the fatigue symptoms I was having.I appreciate this formula for increasing my metabolism in as much as helping with the fatigue.It is what I bought it for and it is delivering."
2,Save your money!,"I did not notice any difference in my metabolism with this product. Would not recommend. If your thyroid is sluggish go see your doctor, get the blood work completed and the doctor will advise you with prescription medication.Nancy Duprey-Okurowski"
1,Dissatisfied,I was not satisfied with product at all.Did not make any difference in my energy level or weight.Would not buy again
1,heavenlymel,This product does not do anything for weight loss! Or did it do anything spectular for my thyroid! A waste of money.
3,Thyrotril Review,So far I am having good results with Thyrotril. I will say that I have seen a difference as far as it being easier to have that little bit of extra energy. I feel my body working better when I exercise.
1,This company has horrible service. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!,"After ordering Thyrotril and having absolutely no results, I called to get information on returning the product. I spoke with the customer service manager and the head of the company. They were both extremely rude and unprofessional. I would not recommend anyone use their services."
1,Disappointed,After using this product for a few days the only thing I noticed was extreme constipation. I did not feel any more energy and after several days of constipation I felt sluggish. My system returned to normal after stopping this product and I don't want to use it again.
2,It didn't work for me,"There's not much to say. It just didn't work for me. I was sick the first day I took it but I thought my body was just reacting to it. Although the nausea went away, my weight stayed the same...and mind you! I was taking it along side working out and following a very strict diet. SInce then, i stopped taking it - just following my exercise plan and diet. I don't think it's worth it."
1,no difference,Did I take a sugar pill? I felt absolutely no different. It did nothing it claims to do. Do not recommend
3,Quick dash of romance that is scintillating and sexy,"The Devil's Own unites Kerry Bishop - a woman sent on a mission to the beleaguered jungle in Montenegro engulfed in flames of war to save the children and bringing them safely to America to their adoptive parents, and Lincoln O' Neal - a flawed and embittered photojournalist.Sandra Brown wrote this book under the pseundonym of Erin St. Clare and as one of her dated works, it offers romance that is scintillating and sensuous with full-fledged emotions. However, the storyline stretches too far to be credible. It is naivete that a photograph could save them from being harmed by the guerillas; and immensely funny that Linc couldn't see through the deception of her tag as a nun. The Devil's Own is not quite as devilish as it seems but for a quick read - it is perfect."
2,Too Farfetched,"The story was not credible. I know this is not necessarily a requirement in Romance, but I didn't think there was a ""romance"" either. I found Kerry's reason for putting herself in extreme danger ludricous! And three times the group was put in mortal danger that they amazingly got through without one fatality. Too much. Not a keeper."
3,"Not that great, but not bad..","I think reprints are humorous to a point. It shows you how the author started out as a new/young writer. This quick read was okay, even though it was pretty predictable. SB is like any other writer, she comes up with some good ideas for a story plot at times, and at times she doesn't. I read this story through in one day and I liked Linc a great deal. Brown has a sense of wit that always comes through in her characters. I agree the plot was a little far-fetched, but it's only fiction. I'd recommend this book as a quick romance read."
1,Awful,"The wartorn jungle of Montenegro? In Central America? Montenegro is a Balkan state.....sadly, the rest of this book is just as dumb."
2,Devils Own,"This book is typical of Sandra Brown's older novels. This book is one of my least favorites of all her books. It is a reprint and a quick read, but the book does not have the most believable story line."
2,Disappointing.,"The zipper on mine also broke right away, and I'm disappointed at the flimsy, lightweight construction compared to the one I bought locally. The shelves don't hold much weight and I'll have to be careful what I put on them."
4,nice little gitbox,"As a guitar playing novice, I find this guitar just about perfect for me and my 10 month old daughter to pound away on. My only complaint is that the g string is very hard to tune. I have an electronic tuner and that one string jumps from too sharp to too flat with a very slight twist of the peg, but it eventually settles in.Oh yeah, and it didn't come with the song book."
2,Original ideas? Not so much...,"Not sure if this is some type of spin-off of the original or part of a series. However, I recommend that you simply pick up this five minute read at the library and use the $ saved for gas [to/from the library] and a cup of Starbucks while reading it."
5,Greatest CD Ever!,This is the best CD I have ever listened to. Every track is awesome. Everyone should own this CD.
5,Can I give more than 5 stars???,"Because I'm from northeast Iowa, I've been lucky enough to hear Rearview Mirror on radio and on an EP. Hopefully people in other parts of the country will get the chance to hear this band too. Matt Olson is an amazing guitarist, and the other TJ and Jason are gifted musicians as well. I think the strength of Rearview Mirror is in Adam's vocals. He has incredible range and power. Listen to 28/7 to hear both of these talents. Adam also shines as a songwriter. The lyrics are very personal and deep. My favortie songs are City Walls, All Lights Off, and Sinking. There really isn't a bad song on the album, so they all might be my favorites. I highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates talent."
5,One of Terje's Best!,"""Descendre"" - Terje Rypdal on guitar, synthesizers, flute, Palle Mikkelborg on trumpet, flugelhorn, synthesizers, and Jon Christensen on drums, recorded March 1979 at Talent Studio, Oslo and released in 1980.What can I say about this album other than it's simply amazing. Very beautiful, textural, and never looses focus. I highly recommend Terje Rypdal's ECM works (i. e. ""Chaser,"" ""Waves,"" and ""Blue""). Each of those albums are worth checking out. His guitar playing is as distinctive as other jazz guitarists like Bill Frisell, John Abercrombie, and Pat Metheny. I love the way he uses effects like reverb, distortion, and delay to mold his trademark sound, but he also uses the whammy bar of his Statocasters to create awesome vibrato.Anyway, all the musicians have created something really special with session. For all Terje fans, this album is a must buy."
5,"yeah, dogs are man's best friend...:D",Thank you for the great service. The book arrived in perfect condition. Thanks for being so prompt in getting it to me. :)
4,Great Book,This book had a wealth of information that proved helpful and also reinforced lessons already learnt
2,Roboform is Bad Customer Service.,"A former PAID customerI purchased roboform and used it for about 3 months, I find their customer service terrible and i have lately had several drive problems that made me have to reinstall my OS, I was forced to reactivate roboform a email joke back and forth I gave up and use LASTPASS.com, It's FREE and way easier. Honestly most of the reviews have nothing todo with problems or customer service, If you dont need those things then maybe you will favor them but lastpass.com is truly free and works way better. I would check it out before i purchase roboform. Just as me I paid for Roboform and dont use it cus the problems with they company and i wont miss it period."
1,Bad Customer Service,"I have 3 desktop Roboform licenses. Today, they ask me to pay another $57($19x3) for upgrades. What a joke! Very ready company."
2,Roboform,"I've had roboforms on both my flashdrive and notebook for a few years now. Luckily, without issues--until now. I can't access my passwords on my flashdrive. I'm flabbergasted at the reviews that give roboform 5 stars for tech support becuase they don't have any. If you call the toll number you never get a person. When you leave a message they don't return the call. So I emailed as well. I haven't heard anything back from the email either. This is not a minor issue; our lives, unfortunately revolve around passwords. And when you can't access them you can't access anything. This issue happened at work and since I couldn't get tech support I had to drive 45 minutes home and 45 minutes back to get my notebook computer so I could access my passwords. So even though up until now I haven't had any issues with the product, keep in mind that when you do have issues you're on your own."
1,Company Cheated Me,"In 2003 as one of the early users of Roboform I paid extra for a lifetime subscription to upgrades- Now i go to upgrade and they want me to start paying a yearly fee; no excuse or apology. A blatent taking of my money - Criminal. And they think that i would let them cheat me, pay them more money, and then give them access to all my passwords and bank accounts..."
1,"Unless you never want to stop paying for this software, don't get!","At first I loved this program. It had lifetime free updates to new versions and kept track of my passwords. Now all of a sudden it demands that I have to renew it's ""subscription"" every year for $29.95. Bait & Switch...No thanks...I'll use a different software. I CAN do without this one!"
2,They Changed so I will,For all the reasons listed by others I will move from Roboform to LastPass (free and rated 1 by PCMag)after more than 10 years with Roboform. The way they have handled their new software and mishandled their older customers is shameful.
5,What's not to like?,A product you will never want to live without after you use it. Invaluable for online banking and shopping. Works with Firefox and IE.
1,Don't deal with a dishonest company.,"This is not a bad product, but I cannot recomend it becase the comapny has lost all integrity. For years they sold this product as having free upgrades and alot of people bought it because of this. Now they have decided they don't want to give customers the free upgrades they were promised. I would not buy from this company."
1,Does not always work! So you try to upgrade and you pay all over again and only get 1 year. (if the version lasts that long!),"Like many others I have been loyal to Roboform for years. I have always been happy with the product and it worked as stated. But with computers getting more advanced and the internet being ever changing, Roboform no longer can handle all situations and passwords. Does not deal with separate username and password on second page or when a pop up comes up to fill in info. Sometimes on even a regular page it says it doesn't see any where to fill in any thing. So you go to get your upgrade (whether free or not) and after looking for a while realize by the time you get what you need (example; PC, Mobile, more tha a year of service, etc) you have spent a fortune! Then what if the upgrade doen't fix those problems? Do you have to buy another year again when the newest upgrade comes out 3 months later? Like everyone has said......just avoid the hassle and choose a different product."
1,"I installed this product and it worked for one day now it does nothing, and I am very dissatisfied with it.","I installed this product and activated it, it worked for one day and now it does nothing I intend to reinstall but as of now I am very dissatisfied. The product I purchased was roboform pro."
3,"Okay, but with issues","The program works well, but there are serious caveats.1. Some routine browser updates remove the Roboform capability. So you have a choice of keeping Roboform or incurring vulnerability by not updating the browser.2. Roboform claims to have phone support. In my experience, it was a lie. I could not reach phone support despite many tries and Roboform admitted ""We're too busy to give phone support.""3. Roboform had an arrangement for ""support"" with an outfit based in India called ""iguru"" which apparently tried to sell unneeded services.So I give the product a B+ but the company and its ethics a D-"
1,Scam Warning: NEVER trust Siber Systems/RoboForm - they are THIEVES AND LIARS,"Conduct business with Siber Systems/RoboForm at your own risk. Bought RoboForm by Siber Systems back when their website guaranteed free lifetime upgrades. The Siber Systems criminals came up with a nice little scam and are now trying to charge the users who purchased under the lifetime guarantee. They are also giving new users only a limited time license; so you will have to keep forking over money to Siber annually lest they hold all of your passwords hostage. Law enforcement needs to investigate Siber Systems and see what they are really up to. Fortunately, there are lots of other very good alternatives to RoboForm. RoboForm isn't that great anyway; frequent bugs, browser incompatibility, etc. But just because they have a mediocre product, is no warrant to steal and lie."
2,"Very decent product, disappointing company","I've been a happy user of Roboform 6 for a couple years now, and was happy to see that version 7, with several enhancements had been released. As a paid customer, I was pleased that I'd be able to upgrade for free, as Siber Systems grandly proclaimed at the time of purchase. Unfortunately Siber Systems has reneged on this promise and upgrades now must be paid for. Lying to customers exposes the unethical nature of this company, and I cannot recommend Siber System's products for this reason."
1,"Roboform software review - waste of time & money, w/video proof","Length:: 3:27 MinsRoboform password and form filling software was a waste of time and money. See the video proof, but it can delay your browser 10 seconds every time you go to a new page, and for some sites, like Youtube, delay for 30 seconds and then crash your browser."
1,Rather beat myself with a stick...,"After at least 15 years with Roboform...I simply GIVE UP. It's become so complicated, with passwords to protect my passwords, support very difficult to reach and NO good Search function within the FAQ...and the level of complication is NOT USER FRIENDLY at all...so now, at 65, after purchasing every version they ever offered...I GIVE UP. I will do it myself or find another password manager which is much less complicated and easy to use! I will give this present to myself of restoring less frustration and pain in my life! Hopefully they will get the hint."
3,Just okay,"While I really like both Hedy Lamarr and William Powell, this film is not a great use of their talents. Powell is a much better comedic actor and you find yourself looking for more of his charm and wit, but not much is there in this movie. Lamarr is most famous for looking great but also was a pretty good actress. Here she has little to do with her part and aside from a couple scenes, they have her with some goofy hairstyles that don't do her justice. Rathbone and Trevor are both very good as villians here and keep the film from being any worse. Also Felix Breshart is always good to see, but his comedic skills like Powell are muted with the screenplay. See The Heavenly Body for a better pairing of Powell & Lamarr."
4,Very Good Movie,"This is a Very Good Movie, that I had never seen before. William Powell as always is Excellent. There is a very good supporting cast, including, Hedy Lamarr, Basil Rathbone, Claire Trevor, and Felix Bressard. A good mystery, akin too Film Noir. It is Not in my humble opinion, a great movie, it is a good movie. Maybe, aptly described, as a, Good Old Good One. This is a WB Archive Collection Disc, made on demand. It is NOT Remastered. The Quality is good."
1,Pure Trash,"Oh my word, I bought this book thinking that it would at least help me understand the pros and cons of the rapture issue. And I was soooo dissappointed I actually grew ill. I guess the author wrote this book for the uninformed. He didn't take into account his readers reading OTHER, more knowledgable authors. For example, I bought Canyon Adams' books on these subjects (666 and The Signs), and Mr. Adams had me so amazed that I furthered my research. I then bought this book and, alas, could only shake my head and be sad at the terrible research this guy did. It was pathetic. He bent facts and made up scenarios. I was so negatively moved that I had to come on here and warn other readers. THIS BOOK IS FULL OF FALSE GLUNK AND POORLY RESEARCHED FALSEHOODS. Buy a better book."
3,Good but not Great,"The whole book is an ongoing argument. As for scriptural reference to a pre-trib point of view, I only know of 1 (Rev.3:10)""Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon all the earth."" This passage is the only reason I even consider a pre-trib possition. Mr. Lahaye doesn't do a real good job of defending his possition in this book. A couple of his other 'non fiction' books do a much better job of it. I decided that I will love and serve the Lord and leave he timing up to Him."
4,Interesting reading for those seeking more knowledge,"I found the book very interesting and was amazed at the rivalry between the different viewpoints. It seems to me that although these issues are important, the most important issue lies in WHAT one believes instead of WHEN. I would hate to see souls lost over bickering about specifics!"
2,"much history, little Bible","Tim spends a large portion of the book trying to defend the oft' attacked history of the rapture doctrine. Most of the scriptures/arguments he uses to defend his thesis may apply against certain notions, but do not defend his thesis against truth. His only real Biblical argument spends much time around 1 Thes 4:17. Unfortunately, out of necessity, he ignores the following verses in Chapter 5 which disallow his thesis.Overall, if you want detail on the history of the rapture doctrine this has some interesting info, but don't take it to the bank. If your looking to convince yourself of the pretrib you already believe, this will probably do nicely. I highly recommend reading some contrasting views if you are a seeker."
4,For broader studies,"While the author may not be primarily known for his commentaries on biblical prophecy, he's definitely brushed up on his studies in recent years. This book, however, does not include any original thinking to the ongoing debate on pre-, mid- or post-tribulation theories, and should be considered a debating literature study. Being a defense for the pre-tribulation view, I have no difficulty agreeing with the author's point of view. However, the reader will need some knowledge of the current debate in order to obtain full benefit of the content. As an addition to the current debate the book stands for itself. The major arguments of this discussion are well organized and debated.Recommendation: While the book may not enter the curriculum of every conservative bible college, buy it to broaden your insights in an intensely interesting subject - the Return of Jesus Christ and the Rapture of His Church."
5,An excellent book about God's truth!,"Tim Lahaye's book is thoroughly based on scripture. He takes a literal interpretation of God's word on end time events. There are many dissenting views as opposed to the pre-trib rapture view, but they are not biblically sound. The scriptures back up and support a pre-trib view. If you have your bible, read it for yourself! So many times in his book, Lahaye shows that the church will be saved from the wrath to come. The believers in Christ will be raptured and taken out of this world, and he backs this all up with scripture. If you want to know and understand the book of Revelation to a greater degree, and you want to know what will happen when Jesus comes for his bride(the church), then this is the book for you. Tim Lahaye helps to explain God's near-future plan!"
1,Condemns Valid Viewpoints,"Different escatological viewpoints should be approached with respect and humility, with an open mind and an understanding that the Bible is not clear on exactly which view is correct. Harsh condemnations based only on presuppositions (as Dr. LaHaye does in ""Rapture Under Attack"") are unreasonable and should be avoided, period.Dr. LaHaye has no interest in that. He harshly criticizes anyone who dares to not hold to a preTrib rapture viewpoint. He calls other viewpoints ""demonically inspired"" at one point, which I find particularly angering and unreasonable.It's okay to have a particular opinion regarding escatology, and even to thing that those who disagree with you are wrong, but it's not okay to publish such a damning condemnation of other viewpoints when the Bible isn't clear. Dr. LaHaye steps far over the line with this book by cruelly attacking viewpoints totally within the realm of orthodoxy."
3,Helen Forrest --the Cream of Helen Forrest,"Helen's performance of ""Smike Gets In Your Eyes"" makes this CD is worth it all by itself."
4,I'm glad I discovered Helen Forrest.,"Thank you Pandora! If it wasn't for Pandora, I would probably have never discovered Helen Forrest and this was a great album. I also discovered Julie London, she is also wonderful to listen to."
1,17 GB size?,"Almost a 7gb download, then 17 GIGABYTES ON MY COMPUTER? Wow. Just wow. Forget this game... way too much space."
2,Crap!,"I bought this game with great hopes and I was greatly disappointed. I'll be short here and say that: 1) I felt like I was playing a game made for a 12-year old. 2) I had to deal with multiple game-killing bugs. But the worst was dealing with SONY Online Entertainment's (SOE) billing department. I hate recurring billing, so I used SOE game cards. I would enter a card's code but my account was never credited. After hassling with SOE's billing department (for God knows how long!) to the point where I threatened to report them to the Better Business Bureau, they finally fixed my account's problems. To SOE's credit, they were actually quite apologetic about the mix-up but by that time it was too little too late. I ended up giving the game away to a friend along with two unused SOE game cards. To this day, he has never used it."
2,Big Disappointment,"I really wanted to like this game but the bugs and performance of the game made it unplayable. This product feels like beta and SOE should be ashamed of charging customers to test their products. Besides all the technical issues the game is standarg mmorpg faire. The combat is similar to WoW's and the crafting is the same as EQ2's. The world design is beautiful, but feels sterile. There are no little creatures scurrying about, or any social hubs like Mos Eisley in SWG or Ironforge in WoW. I think the game will suffer from the great expanses of nothingness in a couple months and may become a ghost town. Anyways, save your money unless you absolutely must play the latest in SOE's lineup."
1,Not What I Had Hoped,With all the hype about Vanguard the product that arrived at my door was a far cry from the game beta testers talked about. I think it can be a good game when the devs actually finish it. I don't recommend it maybe in a year when its completed and patched. It was a definite let down.
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"The Vanguard MMO is disappointing. As a PvE game, it feels incomplete -- a nice start, but it still feels like beta. Mobs run backwards, or fight other NPCs invisibly. Lots of NPCs standing around waiting for quests to be assigned to them. Visually OK, but targeting mobs is difficult, and the performance was laggy.Both Dark Age of Camelot and WoW are vastly superior MMOs. Vanguard still needs some development."
1,disc fine game not so much,game in general would have been good content would have been amazing if it wasn't for the hard core lag from the server they had a ton of technical issues all the time the game was rarely up on a server and when it was it barley worked maybe if they changed things i would try it again but as it is i wount go back
3,Wont work,"I gave three stars because I think the game would be pretty good if it would launch. I have had this problem for awhile now, when the game is connecting it freezes at connecting screen. If I can figure out how to resolve the issue, then I will be back to write another review."
2,Almost 3 years later and still a bug ridden mess.,"Thought I would give this game a go again. I figured it's approaching on 3 years so it must be much better now right? wrong. Still has bugs from launch day that have never been fixed along with a host of others. Never have I played such a buggy pay to play mmo, it's just pathetic. And the development team consists of 4 or 5 people, and admittedly by this very dev team they don't even have a person to fix graphic bugs. Seriously? and we're supposed to pay monthly for that?"
2,Go elsewhere,"The game itself is flawed and buggy. There are major lag issues. It's not all bad as there are a few well thoughtout aspects in the game. Unfortunately, early players found ways to hack in-game gold and other monies so the economy is way off center. They may have worked out some of their issues but I wouldn't bank on it."
1,Worst online game I've ever played,"Even with an above average computer, I had to reduce the graphic settings down to a bare minimum, making it so ugly that it was painful to look at. Even then I had terrible lag when I was near a congested area or town. Very very grahpics unfriendly game. The gameplay and quests weren't great either. When my level 4 character died the game spawned me in a place next to much higher level creatures and it was impossible to safely return to the newbie grounds without asking for help. At that point I quit in frusteration and never went back."
1,Great in theory.....,"I read all of the hype about this game and believed it. The game play is terrible. Characters look terrible. Swimming backwards looks like swimming forward, but in the other direction, and you can't get your head above the water to take a breath, so outside of finding land your dead. Clipping needs ALOT of work, because if your not really close to anything, it just disappears, not fades out, disappears. Yes the game is vast and big, but there is nothing in it, you have to walk for miles to get to anything. The newb areas are rediculous, there aren't enough quests to get you through level 8. Now you have to go find mobs and grind a while, a long while. Did I mention the fact that the combat leaves much to be desired for what was supposed to be the NEXT GENERATION MMORPG. Save you money people this one is a bore."
5,The Best of the Best,"Read this full review before buying:First, the game is insane. I've played DOZENS of MMORPG through my life, starting from DOOM and rolling through all genres, maturity levels and styles. This is the new generation, and it has been a LONG time since a game captured my heart and attention like this one.Now the warning:This is breaking on the scene and is a bit rough on the edges, it was launched in a rush and thus still has bugs. Additionally, it requires ALL of the top specs of todays technology (RAM, Video Card, Sound). If your system is old, I do not suggest buying it, if you are impatient and/or would like a completely polished game then this isn't it.If you have a good computer, and/or are willing to buy a new Video Card (this is the biggest item most will have to upgrade), and are ok with a few bugs, then this game is for you. The best way to put it, is you are looking at a game that will be the best of the best in the coming months/years."
5,Vanguard - Half EQ1...the rest fun fun fun,"After spending the last three weeks playing Vanguard, I am finding that there is tremendous challenge....solo AND group content....excellent video and sound... There are some things I would add or change... but for only being out a month, at this time, i think this game is phenomenal. I'm thoroughly hooked."
3,Vanguards review from a regular with MMORPG's,"As someone who's played several MMORPG's (EQ2, SWG(from release until the CU) GW, DDO,FFO, DAOC)- Vanguard seemed extremely suited for someone whos missing the content from EQ1. This comes directly from the people I play with on a regualar basis. I didnt personally play EQ1 but from the people who did - they love Vanguard. The crafting system is interesting since you can gain xp without having actual resources in your inventory. You will need an extremely good comp to effectively to run Vanguard. I personally played it for 1 week and then went back to Guild Wars and EQ2. But the game was overall decent."
2,Vanguard-Not much fun,"I upgraded my computer when I got this game. This game is still laggy even at low graphic levels. Just for interest, I compared the game play with World of Warcraft. Vanguard felt like it was playing underwater. I finally just stopped playing. Why? I was not fun and I did not care for the gaming community. This may change over time. I just want to add that I came into this game being a past player of EQ, EQ2 (yuck), DaoC, and Wow. I was hoping to recapture the original EQ, but did not find it in this game.Tony"
3,For Lineage Withdrawl,"I've been playing Lineage2 for 3 years, as Malorie on Gustin. Then, all NCSoft games went Vista non-compatable. I'm happy to say that Vanguard is Vista compatable, although the game guide is ancient, 3 months after the launch. So far, some of the character actions are a little slow for my taste, but at least it works!! Mal lives!!"
4,Best MMO in a long time for some folks,"Finally another game where everything isn't just handed to you! Death actually means something and you want to avoid it! Not every race can be every class, and that's as it should be IMHO, and yes I know not every race can be every class in WoW, but see the first two comments. If you played EQ original, and DAoC and would like to try a modern game of that type give Vanguard a go. Now I will say you need an up to date machine, or be willing to scale the graphics way back to run this game. There are still lots of bugs, but even with that I prefer this over WoW, Guildwars, or EQ II. The core gameplay is there and the bugs will be ironed out."
2,Second Job,Game looked great and all but it felt like a second job. Wasn't worth the effort put into it (Made it to lvl 18 bard before canceling my account).
2,Vanguard..give it a few months,This game had a lot of potential that wasn't realized at release.bad bugs..terrible latency..and what I like to call BEWS (Big Empty World Syndrome)Unless you have a pretty high end computer save yourself some grief and either pass or wait for the free trial.
2,withering death,the game is suffering a slow withering death. the population size can not sustain itself. new players suffer the most as everyone who has stuck with the game is max lvl and very clickish and harsh to new comers. dont be fooled by the few fanboys who go form gaming site to site blowing hotair about how much better the game is and about how the population is oaring and grouping is plentiful. They lie. Their only concern is to get another months sub
2,Wasted Potential,"What could have been a good game is ruined by laggy play and the inclusion of all the worst ""time wasting"" parts of RPGs... interminable travel times, body recoveries and endless ""Kill X number of X beast and report to me"" quests. Everything just moves sooo slowly..."
1,Found it very poor,"I'm writing from Rome. I have the Lonely Planet's Western Europe book but thought since I'm spending some time in Rome I would buy the Let's Go book. But I found it very difficult to use, the index is lacking, the maps poor and not referenced in the text. I have ended up just tossing it and just the few pages of Lonely Planet's guide to get around. I had hoped Let's Go with it's long experience in Europe could compete with LP but not in this case."
2,2003 was _much_ better,"I really don't know what went wrong with Let's Go. It used to be a great series, full of the insider tips that excused its occasional snarkiness. Now, quite suddenly, it starts substituting ""guy on the street"" and other non-sequiters for content. I've used the 2003 Rome and the 2004 Rome, and while 2003 let some of the nasty changes in, it still managed to preserve the spirit of the series. It was also about fifty times better written. I know the staff changes each year, so this isn't all that surprising. My advice: if you can find the 2003 guide used, buy it! Even if it's not completely updated, it had that edge which made Let's Go Let's Go, instead of some bland guide geared towards no particular audience whatsoever."
3,corelle coordinates counter mats,"These mats are quite a bit sturdier than the great big one. And they have an insulated bottom, so you can put hot dishes on them. Not made in USA, however. I would like to see country of origin required on everything."
5,great timing,"I received this item very fast, faster than i expected with the packaging in excellent condition."
5,Moor Maur Moore Muur and More Knowledge,"Superior book that's all I can say, nothing but the facts any detractors are just hating. Like Malcolm said ""History is a just reward for all research"" and thats what Ivan Van Sertima presents in one of his best works on Moor culture. I would recommend this book along with ""The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present"" by Noble Timothy Myers-EL (2005)"
3,would be better minus Whole World,"""BOB""&Rosa Parks are cool but the ""Whole WOrld"" is lame to me overall&kinda lost when it comes to tempo&vibe.that one song takes the joy out of the other tracks for me&I hope this is the last of it's kind for them in that direction of Song&Production."
5,Another Great Placebo Edition,"I recently purchased the special edition of Sleeping with Ghosts and I think that the bonus cover tracks are the best. This cd is already amazing in its entirity, but the fact that it has the bonus cover tracks makes it that much more necessary for any Placebo fan. My two favorite tracks are ""Running up that Hill"" and ""Ballad of Melody Nelson."" The live Pixie's cover of ""Where is my Mind"" and Depeche Mode's ""I Feel You"" also are up there. Honestly, I can't say that I don't like any of the songs. Placebo can do no wrong!"
4,New fan,This is my first Alkaline Trio album. I picked it up for my boyfriend...he is a huge fan. I like it quite a bit. He says there is not really new material on it. (oh!). I was impressed with the music videos on the Bonus DVD.
3,eh...,"if you MUST own everything alkaline trio or are new to them and have not heard a lot of older stuff, then i would say get this cd. otherwise, theres a song or two i never heard before but the other stuff didnt seem that rare (for instance their split material they threw on here). And the DVD is entertaining but is about a weak 30 minutes long. It definitely is not a full feature Alkaline trio DVD which the ""trailer"" made it seem to be."
2,Remains offers nothing.,"I feel ripped off for buying this CD/DVD. The DVD is the reason I bought it, but it is the most useless compilation of video clips I've ever watched. It has no structure and no point. In terms of the music, the songs are great but are far from ""hard-to-find.""That's two releases in a row (Remains, and ""Deluxe"" Crimson) where Alkaline Trio has put out a low-quality product, and I've had enough. As a long time Alkaline Trio fan, I cannot recommend this product."
5,Great Music,One of his best albums to dateI am a Guess Who fan since 1970 and think his solo workis better than the Guess Who
2,Doesn't even fit properly.,"I tried to install a compatible JVC stereo on my Nissan Altima 04. This kit did not fit properly, nor the holes on the bracket matched the stereo. Even when I installed the bracket somehow, I can't fit my stereo with this mounting bracket. I spent over an hour manipulating and finally had to settle with ill fitting installation without the mounting bracket!What is funny is that JVC itself recommends Metra kit for installation."
4,"Value for Money, pretty good",It was very easy to install the kit but only thing I didnt like was the grain finish which doesn't match with the factory setting. Otherwise product is great and it's total value for money.
1,Motivator?,"Dr. Marmareo was much in the news in the running community a few years back. She encouraged runners in her program who were unprepared for the distance to cut several miles off the Marine Marathon course so they would make the 19 mile cut-off time required in order to be allowed to complete the race. She then saw nothing wrong with them accepting finisher medals just like those runners who actually did the whole marathon. She justified this on the basis that she was trying to raise the womens' self-esteem. Needless to say most in the running community used words other than ""motivator"" in describe her and her actions."
1,Outdated don't waste your money.,"I bought this book for last minute prep for my exam and I foundout it is nothing like the real exam, It doesn't really give you a feel for the real exam,There are other exam preps material out there that gives you more of a feel for the real exam than this book."
4,Great review for my CCNA renewal!,I got my CCNA a few years ago and have to recently upgrade to the new CCNA 640-801. I was a bit nervous as I have heard that there were a lot of changes on this new exam. I really appreciated this book and all of the effor the authors put in to making it technically accurate.
2,Stopped halfway through.,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. I had never heard some of the stories, and thought I learned a lot of things I didn't know. When I got to the story of Lady Jane Grey, and Wyatt's Rebellion I came across ONE sentence that made me doubt everything I had read up until then. The sentence read that Thomas Wyatt the Younger's father, Thomas Wyatt who was the poet, was executed for adultery with Anne Boleyn! This is absolutely outrageous on it's own, but what made it even worse was in a previous chapter, about Henry VIII's fifth wife Katherine Howard, the author tells us of how Katherine intervened on Thomas Wyatt the Elder's behalf, so Henry would release him from the Tower. Not sure where the author gets the idea that Thomas Wyatt can be executed in 1536, but in the early 1540's he is imprisoned in the Tower......"
3,Not always historically accurate,"It is an interesting read, but there are some glaring historical errors. Such as Thomas Wyatt (the poet) being executed with Anne Boleyn. He was only arrested, but later released."
5,Really enjoyed this book,Very interesting book! I recommend it for those who are even just a little bit interested in the history of the tower.
4,Just a little bit more history of the Tower,"more History about the tower, some characters you will recognize and some you wont. Each chapter a different story about a different character. a good read and I learnt some Stuff i didn't know before. If you are about to go see the tower this would be good reading before you go."
1,Pseudo History,"Very disappointing. This is a very lightweight book that is long on propaganda and prejudice, and short on history. There are many factual errors, which means you can't believe anything written here unless you validate it in a real historical reference book. The errors aren't even obscure historical tidbits; they deal with well known, easily verifiable information. The anti-Catholic sentiments and derogatory descriptions were understandable in books written 200 years ago, but modern historians take a much more balanced approach to the subject matter. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Good read,A very interesting read. It's interesting to find that it started out as a castle but ended as a prison. I would like to visit if I ever get to England.
5,Weening from the Bottle Made Simple,"A Godsend for putting children to sleep without a bottle: swaddle your infant, play this music, and hold him in your arms as he falls asleep. No bottle necessary, and skip the trauma of weening. Think, you wont have to pay the dentist to fix the bottle rot, too. Our experience is that this CD worked well with numerous children. And the music is soothingly pleasant."
5,Brings back memories...,"I used to dance to this with my grandma when I was little... sometime in the late 80s. She had it on cassette and I never thought I'd ever hear these songs again! It seems so long ago, and now my grandma has passed on and I still cherish the memories of dancing with her to these songs. Now I can listen to them with my two kids - so glad I found these on amazon."
5,a generation of bedtime comfort,A Child's Gift of Lullabyes was a baby gift when our 3rd child was born (he's now 21!). I played it while breastfeeding before his naps. We used it as part of the bedtime routine until he was 5 and sometimes afterwards at his own request. Now we give it as a baby gift. Such a great way to help a baby relax and sleep.
5,brings back memories,"I still can't believe I found this. I purchased this for my son after hearing these songs from my own Childhood. Every night I would sing my youngest appalacian lulluby to him and after this year, I wanted him to hear the actual song. He loves this cd and often has me put it in repeat. Beautiful songs, last a lifetime."
5,For putting the little one to sleep,"We bought this on the advice of a friend when our daughter was born three years ago. Even now this is a wonderful tool for putting her to sleep (we listen to it in I-tunes and watch the 'fairies' in the built in Visualizer for afternoon naps). Can you believe it, I am actually not sick of the songs after hearing them several thousand times!"
5,Perfect,"My kids are too old now for this music but they listened to the tape almost every night of their infancy. I recently met with some old friends who now have infants and had to tell them about it.This is very special music. i am a composer and I fondly remember hundreds of nights listening to it while my kids drifted off. The other reviewers are clued in to how well it helps kids sleep. I'm also clued in to the great composition and performances. I could never tire of listening to this music.My oldest had severe sleeping problems as a baby and I have listened to a LOT of lullabye music. This one isn't just the best, it's perfect. I cannot imagine anything the producers could have done better. I highly recommend it for kids of all ages. It truly is an immortal gem."
5,Every Mom should have this CD!,I received Child's Gift of Lullabyes when my 25 year old daughter was born and have since gone through 3 more in raising both our daughters! The songs or so sweet and fun to listen to and sing. Both our girls enjoyed the songs for years and still enjoy hearing them for fun. I try to make sure I give one to every new mom I know. The words are so cute and easy to understand and then they are all repeated in instrumental form so your baby can fall asleep while the music softly plays. Enjoy!!
5,A Child's Gift of Lullabyes-CD Created by J. Aaron Brown,"This CD is so beautiful, I played it for my son when he was young. I sang along with the songs to put my son to sleep. We love this song collection. Now, my grandson has his own to enjoy."
3,A disappointed fan,"I wish i could give it more, but it just doesn't come across on cd. The song selection is brilliant, but the performances sound stiff, and the sonics are a bit compressed. Strickly for fans who need to have it all, but newbees should start anywhere but here."
4,I just love it,It was my first digital camera. The camera is just superb. Very good clarity. And the accessory kit was too good for that price.But Camera is bit heavy as I have to use 4 AA batteries. So i deduct 1 star.
1,Super Duper Slow!!!!,This DVD was terrible. The pace was so slow. After I finished working out I felt like I did absolutely nothing. Don't waste your money.
4,Comedy hits and misses,"There are some really nice tunes on here, there are also some tunes that are not-so-great. It's a mixed bag, but all the ""hits"" are here."
3,homeless invasion,"it is easy to enter d'amato's world. her style is clear, her tone confident and her characters and setting are realistic. here, homelessness is the central theme. unfortunately, as in too many other works of contemporary fiction, the overly convenient psychopath rears his ugly head. even the author's afterword ends on a chilling note."
5,Great Book for children learning to read,"WE checked this book out at the library and both my 2 year old & 5 year old loved it. They read out loud along with me and then insist on reading back to me by themselves. My 2 year old cried when I told her that we had to return it, that of course our family now is buying it for our own collection."
4,Works well as a hiking sock,"I bought the socks to use with my mid-high hiking boots. They work well, no hot spots, wick moisture well. I know some reviewers were not happy with the fact these were toe socks. I wear toe socks a lot, so it didn't bother me. However, I didn't find the fact that the socks had toes any great advantage. I didn't notice any wonderful ""proper alignment"" of my feet or any such. I think perhaps it will help me not develop sore spots where I sometimes have a toe nail dig into the toe next to it, but nothing more."
3,Solid but not inspired product,"I love myAdidas Men's adipure Trainer Barefoot Shoe, but when it gets cold...my feet cringe at the idea of landing on the cold ground for my early morning workouts. These socks offered the chance to (somewhat) economically test the efficacy of wearing five toe socks while working out.The $32Injnji Performance Compression Toesockswould probably be the smarter buy, but couldn't see my way to paying that much for a single pair of socks."
2,I expected a better quality product.,"Before I begin with the negative I was very exited to get my first pair of Injnji socks and immediately put them on once they came to the house. The first to times I used them they were great, comfortable, and fitted well. So at first i was very happy with my purchase. I did not really used them with my vibram shoes, because they ended up making the shoes much tighter than I expect it. Nonetheless, I would wear them with my other shoes. Unfortunately, after the third wash I noticed that the seams between the toes were coming apart, even when i followed the care instructions and had only lightly used them. After another wash, it was much worse and it even seems that the toes are coming off the sock. I guess on the bright side once the toe part comes off, I can use them for yoga."
4,My toes thank you.,These socks and all Injinji toe socks feel great and do their job keeping my toes from rubbing. I wish they were more durable. I am finding that these socks are getting thin in spots and generally don't wear well. But I still think they are great for your feet if you walk or run hard like me. My toes thank you:)
2,ok but not great,"Don't be deceived by the picture, these are low crew socks not up the calf as pictured.They are comfortable but the seam at the top band split open the second time I put them on.I will look for a different pair next time."
3,Not a perfect fit . . .,"I read so many raving reviews of this product and thought it would be perfect for me as I am training for a half-marathon, but get blisters in different areas around my toes. I have small feet so I bought the small size which fit great, but my toes are too short to fit into these socks correctly. There is extra material that hangs off the ends of 3 of my toes on each foot. So if you have longer toes, you absolutely have to get these socks. If your toes are stubby, then these probably won't work for you."
2,OP,"Youre paying a lot more than your getting with these socks. Super expensive, shred and get holes in them fast, also they aren't insulated or something my feet are freezing right now"
5,Excellent for my five finger shoes,"This socks are great for my five finger shoes, I run with them, play volleyball, really comfortable, a little tricky to put them on but once you have them on you don't even feel you have them on"
5,Comfortable socks,"These toe socks fit my shoe-size 7.5 feet perfectly. They are attractive, soft and comfortable, and easy to put on. Not too thick, not too thin - feel like normal socks. They keep my feet warm in my sandals in cool weather. Very fast delivery. If the shipping weren't so high, I'd buy several more pair (I have 3 pair)."
2,Just feels weird,"After developing some nice blisters following a long run, these socks were recommended as a good solution. After all, if your toes don't rub together, you won't get blisters, right. Well, I suppose that's true. However, the socks felt really weird on my toes. Personally, I am not used to having sock material jammed between my toes. I should have thought more about that before buying the socks. The best part was taking them off after my run.No blisters though! But I prefer to use Glide to reduce the friction. I will not be wearing these socks again.The worst part was the shipping costs (somewhere around $6!)"
3,"Not ""Sand""","I use the low-cut/ankle versions to run in and love them. I was really looking forward to these Injinji socks because they were ""sand"" colored and appeared wearable for my uniform which requires khaki socks. These socks are not what I would consider ""sand"" colored, but rather grayish-green."
4,"Good, but not without flaw","While these socks do take a little more effort to put on one's feet, they are worth it. They do feel different, but mostly while one isn't wearing shoes. While shod, they don't feel much different than regular socks of the same fabric. However, they are precisely the wrong height for work boots. They barely come up to the tops of 8"" and 10"" boots, and fall down rather easily. If wearing shorter shoes, this is a non-issue, but for boots with collars that rub, it's not ideal. These are all too often a victim of laundry machine abductions and it is never good, seeing as how there is a distinct left and right sock, making pairing more difficult."
1,Socks made of bad material,"I bought these socks to check whether they would help me prevent blisters between the toes during long walks. My findings are the following:- they fitted very well;- after 2 long walks my feet and, specifically, my toes remained blister free;- found the sock too thin to wear as a single layer, and too thick to wear as a double layer;- after 2 extensive walks I already have a hole in one of the big toes and wear and tear can be noticed in the fabric of the socksThere is hence no comparison with my Falke Trekking socks of which I have 3 pairs and have been walking with them on a weekly basis for the last 3 years. They have no holes, nor do they show the level of wear and tear that these Injinji Performance Crew Toeshocks already show after 2 weeks of usage. It is a shame because I did not get any blisters between the toes. So, back to my Falke socks in combination with tape around the toes."
2,"Great concept, horrible quality","I bought a pair locally that lasted me less than 30 miles running before getting a hole in the big toe. Figured it may be a fluke so I bought a pair from Amazon. They lasted me just a 14 mile run. I keep mi nails well clipped. Its no fluke, these socks are crap quality. The concept is great but execution is piss poor. I will go back to putting zinc oxide between my toes to avoid blisters."
5,great for any time - including barefoot,socks were as advertised for size so look for the size translator whick gives male and female chart to regular socks.
3,ok,"pros:+ warmcons:- have left and right socks, but it does not make them fit any better than my other socks that can be used on either feet. just give me more trouble each morning matching the pair- no cotton. (it's all petroleum)open for debate:. silly red label"
3,Too sweet,"If you're looking for a before or after workout bar, this one is too sweet. A lot of chocolate and pecans. It's like eating a candy bar. Go for the regular Balance bar or a Clif bar."
2,Sickly sweet to me,"These looked like something I'd like but I found them to be far too sweet - the sugary taste overwhelmed the chocolate/granola/nut flavors. Obviously, we don't all have the same tastes. For a reference point on my flavor preferences, my favorite tasting energy bars/snacks are - Luna chocolate pecan pie, Luna nutz over chocolate, Balance Go Mix toffee crunch, Balance Go Mix chocolate nut crunch. I also like Lara Bar cherry pie and banana cookie (raw foods bars with only three or four ingredients per bar). They are expensive, though, and not as high in protein (4 or 5 grams)."
2,Azomite Contains Lead,"I bought this product as I had read about its amazing mineral content. The article suggested taking this as a suppliment (it is, in general, used as a fertilizer). I also saw a Youtube video of a health fanatic who talked about taking this as an aid to getting the best quality minerals, as Azomite comes directly from the earth. Unfortunately, it also contains lead, which I didn't realize before I bought. I stopped using it after finding out about the lead."
4,HIGH HOPES FOR THIS PRODUCT,"Can't wait to use it, such good word o'mouth...Came in a nice tight bag, and I sprinkled some on mystarving plants -- herbs, mostly.Texture was fine and smooth, consistent, powdery.Color light pinkish brown. Dissolved easily when I pouredsome water over it after depositing a tablespoon over the root areas.I will update after I see the plant's response."
5,Great Fertilizer,This is great for plants and flowers. It's also good for things higher up the food chain. Why spend a fortune on supplement minerals when this dirt has it all? Those of you who say lead is in this product don't get it. We smart humans are the ones that took lead and put it in paint in concentrations that will kill us! (sarcasm off).
4,The book I'll never forget,"It's my first time to read a novel by Nick Joaquin. I was fascinated with the way he presented the plot and the flashbacking of events. Although at first, I only read it for my course's requirement, yet I found it so amusing especially with Connie and her mother as I moved along the pages of the novel. Something that I did not expect to finish reading until the last pages of the book. My journey with Nick Joaquin was unforgettable. Now I know why Filipinos have the power to write great masterpieces, like this."
5,All Because of My Professor II,"I have finished reading the book and it was superb! I knew it...from the moment I read the first chapter that I was going to like it. The author employed a style that is very rare among other writers. He does not morally preach but the book makes you think if he intentionally did that or not. Hay! I admire Connie's courage to change. At least even at the last minute she was able to take into what the Monsons were trying to persuade her into. Same thing goes with the other characters, and especially Dr. Monson, too. I felt his grave disappointment, finding that there was no longer ""HOME"" in the Philippines. Now, I must begin to write my critical analysis to this book. Am I going to give it an A plus, plus, plus rating or what! You bet!"
2,Wow!,"When I read Jane Eyre years ago, I always assumed that she was a fictional character. However, I recently stumbled upon this book and realized that Jane Eyre is a real person! She has to be; how else could she have written this book??Though the book is not that good, I am so relieved to discover that Jane Eyre is still alive and doing well. I hope that her and Rochester are still happily married and that they have many wonderful years ahead of them."
2,Sakura Gelly Roll Metallic Pens,I was disappointed in the color. I ordered these because I love shiny metallic colors and Pentel has such a limited variety. It is definitely not a shiny metallic ink. It is a matte finish that does not reflect light. They work well: nice smooth flow without any skipping. I'm going to gift them to a coworker and go back to Pentel.
5,Great!,"Ordered these for a blast from the past and these pens haven't changed a bit. Super gelly and awesome, will buy again"
2,great seller but not too good for products,"the colours arent as nice as the cap. it's kinda perl-ish colours but most of them are very very dull. you thought that red gonna be sparking red, but it's just greying dark maroon colour, and the same goes to navy, dark green and orange.but the seller is really nice, i got the product in two days after i ordered!"
3,"I Dearly Love Burl Ives, But.......","I have loved Burl Ives' music for as long as I can remember, and this album has some of the very best folk songs imaginable, but the sound is very bad on some cuts and many are just very short little ditties. Some of the backup singers don't do much for me either.I find it very hard to believe that with today's technology the sound could not have been dramatically improved. Some tracks sound as if they were taken directly off a well used 78 rpm (may have been actually!). I bought the album primarily for the namesake song, 'Poor Wayfaring Stranger', but the sound on this is one of the worst and the song incomplete, barely 1:15. I should have stuck with Joan Baez or Emmylou Harris for a good version.If you really like Burl Ives go ahead and buy it, but be prepared for substandard sound. Your children may love it as well. This CD was just too expensive for such marginal quality."
1,poorly designed index makes book difficult to use,"As a librarian, I would never buy this book for a library due to the weird, illogical index. It is not easy to use and presents many problems for a researcher or browsing patron.The index is the first place an acquisitions librarian looks at and this one is not nicely done! A traditional index would have been much better."
4,Great little phone,"I've had this phone for over a year now and never had a problem with it. It doesn't come with games, but I downloaded games and now play more than I talk! The camera doesn't zoom and quality is not good, so if you want a good camera phone, this is not the phone for you. One thing I really like about this phone is that you can record whatever you want and then save it as your ringtone."
5,An Instant Hit!,This book was an instant hit in our house. My daughter enjoys having it read to her as well as participating in the rhymes herself. We also like going through each page to solve the mystery behind who's on the next page. Beautifully illustrated and lots of fun for both parent and child.
3,"What is the song at the Dance Club from ""The Invisible""","I sampled all the songs on the Soundtrack ""The Invisible"" and I couldn't find the song they play when the girl goes to the dance club, lets her hair down and dances, while the invisible person is standing there watching her. Does anyone know the band and name of song?"
5,Biblical analysis,"This book, for me, represents a new and refreshing way at understanding the bible. It is well written and logical. I am very happy to have purchased this book. Ted E."
4,Excellent literary overview of the Old Testament,"Dorsey does an excellent job within the limits of a 'flyover"" approach to the literary structures of the Hebrew Scriptures. The introduction and first chapter is a great primer on the types and purposes of literary style. The brief overviews of literary structure are akin to a satellite image that allows a ""from the top"" view of a neighborhood that gives a ""lay of the land"" concept - and helps at the ""street"" level of moving through texts, connecting them into a more comprehensive array.The potential to see harmonies and purposes where before scholars have only seen ""cut and paste"" approaches to editing, or have discounted the throughtfulness and intentionality of the text is encouraging. It is accessible to the lay reader while also serving those who desire a more scholarly resource."
3,Callaway Spoon Rest,"I was a little disappointed at the light plastic feel to this spoon rest (maybe that's what ""melamine"" is?) but it's durable and matches my Corelle Callaway dishware perfectly."
2,corelle coordinates callaway melamine spoon rest,Uh oh! Melamine from China? What's in the paint? Item is mediocre at best. Nicest thing I can say is that it matches everything else.
3,Corelle product,This product is okay. I personally don't think it matches that great to rest of my callaway items. How every it is a corelle product.
1,Wrong pattern,"I didn't return it, as it was a Christmas gift, but the spoon rest actually featured Corelle's ""Chutney"" pattern instead of the Callaway. The external packaging was labeled as ""Callaway,"" but the bottom of the rest clearly reads ""Chutney,"" and is most obviously not ivy. Something to be fixed for future customers, yes?"
4,"Durable, easy to clean","My wife is absolutely obsessed with Corelle. She loves it when things match. Hence, we need to get everything that goes with the Callaway set of Corelle products. I am nowhere near as enthusiastic about Corelle as she is, but this product is nice. It is very light, handles heat well, cleans easily and won't break if dropped. It does all of that and still manages to keep your counter area clean."
4,Interesting trip down memory lane,"Like all of King Diamond's albums, this one graphicly demonstrates the multi-octave range of King's vocals and carries some heavy, tight, guitar work. Overall, it is a very good album, ""The Storm"" being my favorite track, as has a great tempo and beat. It is obvious that the lyrics have been carefully thought out and meticulously crafted, but I found myself listening much more closely to the way King's vocals sounded rather than to what he was singing.Like all KD/MF releases, it is an acquired taste, but a ""must have"" for his established fan base."
5,The best King Ever!!!,"Finally, King Diamond has returned to the way we all love him. The evil storyteller has just released Abigail II the Revenge and I love it !!!!!!!The story is outstanding, the music is classic King. You must have this CD if you are even slightly interested in King Diamond."
1,The worst KD ever..,"I really dont know what happened to te bada$$ riffs, the killer drums.. It's all missing in this album. Lead solos suck...bad. So different from killer classics like Abigail or Them. Dont waste your money!"
2,Mild Revenge,"Lacking the legendary status of the early albums and the aggressiveness that made Voodoo memorable. Many of the songs on this album could have been pieced together from all his past albums. Fans will recognize some of the old riffs. KD's vocals seem to be on a decline and go through all to the growling/talking segments to high pitched screeches at an all too predictable rate. Personally I thought House of God was terrible and at least this was an improvement (not a mjor one though).Having said all that the album is not entirely without enjoyable and groovy parts (tracks 2,3,6, and 10) but by no means a revenge."
2,Disappointing at best.,"There are so many reasons why I'm disappointed with this album. Recycled riffs, uninspired performances, and guitar solos buried in the mix are just the tip of the iceberg. All this could actually be taken with a grain of salt (by the hardcore fan) had it not been hyped so much as the sequel to the 1987 masterpiece ""Abigail"" (which still ranks as one of the best metal albums ever). What should have been a return to form gets bogged down in delusions of grandeur. The fact that the story is set to mediocre music only further indicates a lack of fresh ideas."
2,Product delived,"The Cd test i Was recived, is completed destroyed. It's first time when i recive the cd's in this conditions. I hope that to my next buy, my cds never come destroyer again."
1,This is not good,"Abagail 2 is probably King Diamond's worst cd ever. The production is muddy, the music sub par and the singing is burried in the mix. The lyrics are very good but I would not have purchased Abagail 2 had I known that the music was lame and actually a bit too soft. King Diamond usually releases awesome sounding music this is perhaps the worst and is nothing near as great as the first Abagail.King Diamond will release The Puppet Master in October 2003 and is supposed to be his most horrific and different cd ever. We shall see when it comes out."
2,"He's still the King, but for how much longer?","Abigail II bears no resemblance to Abigail. Gone are the layers of soaring vocals, haunting melodies, complex drum work and inspired guitar soloing. Mikkey Dee is most sorely missed (even Darrin Anthony who played on The Graveyard). The drum work is competent enough, but too predictable. Every double bass kick simply mimics the palmuted riffing and leaves the whole album with a sense of the tried and the true, but not the truly inventive. Even King's vocals have become uninspired. He does more talking, grunting, crying, growling and whispering than display his awesome range and harmonizing as he did on Abigail I. Certainly times have changed and so should the music, but King seems to have completely lost the medieval and operatic tone of his past and embraced the prog-metal wave that we see everywhere we turn our heads now. This album is closer to some of the later Fates Warning than it is to King Diamond. What a shame."
4,pretty good,"An effective compilation of electronic pop with a narrow scope and an overly safe track listing but with plenty of highlights.Im a great fan of Jean Michel Jarre,and this compilation contains the majority of his best-known material."
3,"""another crop of homegrown music of the '60s""","Without the sixties, it's very difficult to envision the development of popular music, as we know it today. Thus enters the birth of Rock 'N Roll and the release on the table ~ ""Absolutely the Best of the Sixties 2"", featuring Barbarians, Chiffons, Dean/Jean, Dion, Gerry/Peacemakers, Bobby Goldsboro, Jarmels, Music Explosion, Mytics, Randy/Rainbows, Royal Guardsmen ~ featured in this collection are the roots of how deep the music goes and how widely and quickly it spread.Stand outs are ~ ""RUNAROUND SUE"" (Dion), ""DON'T LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYING"" (Gerry/Pacemakers) and ""HE'S SO FINE"" (Chiffons) ~ more than satisfying and straighahead tunes ~ with a decidedly catch me if you can flavor ~ much insight on what the listening public wanted during this eye opening decade ~ great job by Fuel 2000 Records and Varese Records ~ this compilation is just the way we like 'em...gotta love it!Total Time: 48:32 on 15 Tracks ~ Fuel 392 ~ (3/23/2004)"
3,"Let me emphasize, I do like this book","First things first, I really like this series and the characters and bought this when it first came out. I'm coming back to it after several years and notice that for some reason, even science fiction authors who are known to push the boundaries seem to fall into political correctness. For some reason the Nutex militia, ostensibly based on Christians exhibit all the terminology and behavior of radical Muslims including treating women as ""sluts"" and making them cover their entire bodies. I found that particular part of the book to be a flaw and falls into typical stereotypes about Christians that are all to prevalent today."
3,TMI,"A great disservice was done to this book by its blurb. The blurb describes a plot point which does not occur until the last quarter of the book, and that completely changed my reading of the story. Not only because it wasn't a plot point which I enjoyed, and thus wasn't looking forward to, but it also meant that when I read through three quarters of this book, I was waiting for something to happen instead of focusing on what was currently happening.On the whole it meant I just wasn't engaged by this particular story, and it seems to have killed the series for me, since I've never gone back to it."
4,One of the best books in the series!,"I greatly enjoyed Rules of Engagement, even more than the previous book in the series, Once a Hero. This book devotes equal time to Esmay Suiza, Brun Meager, and Barin Serrano. While I felt that almost everyone in the Familias Regnant overreacted to Esmay's blow-up at Brun, the resolution of the book left me feeling satisfied. The bad guys are really bad (despite what other reviewers may say, these sorts of people DO exist today) and the action is exciting. Elizabeth Moon has done a great job creating a universe and characters you can care about."
3,My Least favorite of the series!,"This book is definately the worst of the series. But unfortunately you'll probably have to read it so you know whats going on latter in the series. Personally I found the book a bit over done. It could have been shorted by 100 pages or so and still gotten the same effect. The idea that you can kidnap the ""prime minister's"" daughter, gang rape her, and then use her for breeding and not expect to have the a whole pile of trouble coming down on your planet is rediculous. The villians are something out of the 1960-1970's and are just plan moronic. I also find it difficult to believe that if inhabitable planets are becoming in rather short supply that you let a bunch of crazy's keep a perfect one to themselves when your military would find it a walk in the park to disarm said crazy's and use the planet for your population! I enjoy Elizabeth Moon's work, but this is one book that should have had a wee bit more editing!"
4,a superb read,"I've never been one to read these kinds of books but I decided to take a chance. I'd have to say that I was very impressed with the story. It had an original plot, one not found in most stories of this genre. I can see this becoming a movie one day."
1,Bad customer service,The service was slow and rude. The sweatshirt itself is great but i will never buy anything from these people again. They were rude on the phone and over email. Buy else where!
3,Making Sense?,I'm not sure it made that much sense. I was looking for a more practical book on how to do it - how to design an organization based on the needs.
2,Useless theories,"This book lack proof big time. Most of what the authors say in this book are fallacies or opinions where we have to ask ourselves, ""Is this really true?"" or ""Ahhh, this makes sense only because it is common sense."" Without any knowledge of change management skills, half of the book is common sense."
2,A worthwhile reference for beginners,"While Dobyns has gone to some lengths to research Isshinryu, it appears that he falls somewhat short in his understanding of a few key points, and in some areas, he is innacurate or incomplete in his statements. Still, this is one of only a few books that discuss the history of Isshinryu, and it makes a good reference for somebody training in this style."
2,Not exactly Shakespeare,"The Sinful Nuns has lifted much of its plot from Romeo and Juliet, with the additions of a demonic nun and the inquisition. As a whole, the film muddles along with the lovers in turmoil plotline, only picking up steam when the inquisitor shows up. The one horrific sequence that stands out is when the denounced nuns are walled up in their convent, but their is little else. The film has ample nun-related nudity but little ""gore"". Probably not a film to be viewed more than once. The DVD transfer is acceptable."
4,"Naked nuns. Can't be all bad, can it?","Although it isn't actually a horror film, it's still worth checking out if you're into the whole Euro horror/sex film thing. I am and I quite enjoyed this mix of nunsploitation and melodrama. It's better made than most, and not badly acted either. Give it a go."
4,Tong lock is annoying,"These feel nice. Large, heavy, strong. They just feel high quality.But the lock on the tongs gets annoying. It locks anytime you close the tongs while holding them (near) vertically, which leads to a lot of accidental locks.I only use the spatula now. The fork's nice, I just never seem to need it."
1,CANCELED MY ORDER AFTER WAITING 4 WEEKS!,"I ordered this set December 4th for Christmas. After hearing nothing after the 18th I inquired as to the whereabouts of my order. I was informed that the company was tracking it and it had been back ordered. December 23rd, Amazon, NOT the company informed me that the company canceled my order! I ordered another prodduct from someone else. Disgusted!"
4,Excellent Tools,"I love these tools, but I had to learn how to hold the tongs because they pinched my hand at first."
2,Tongs are the Weakest Link,The rubber on the tongs started to fall out after 10 uses or so. Tried to set them back in but they never stayed. Frustrating... now the tongs are designated to charcoal duty. I eventually replaced these tongs with wooden handled ones.
4,Excellent quality,"As usual, weber does not disappoint. Quality is good and worth the money. The handle designs are robust and fit well in large hands. The lanyards are big enough to hook of the new Weber gas grill ""button"" style hooks, that was the biggest problem I had shopping for a grill tool set. Why I even thought of straying from Weber, I'll never know."
5,High quality,"Nice, heavy duty set...high quality items. The rubber grip (on the underside of each handle) is an excellent addition and ensures a good grip on the tools."
5,BBQ Tools,"I love these tools, especially the tongs. They are all long handled keeping your arms and hands out of the heat. They wash up easy and I have loved my purchased."
1,Cheap Product!,"I bought this to support my lower back while sitting in chairs, well it didn't provide very much support at all! Basically you lean against it and it pretty much goes flat? How is that supposed to support anything? I returned it back to Amazon.com...they were very quick with the refund...so thanks for that. Don't bother with this product!"
4,Quality saw,"This is a quality product, just as expected. The one drawback is that I have never gotten as comfortable with the left blade design as I thought I would."
3,PC 424MAG Circular Saw,"Received saw today. Seems well made and the table looks very good. However, do not believe the note that it comes with a case. It does not! It comes with a very cheap bag that does nothing to protect the saw and does not even have a pocket for saw blades or the manual. The electric brake still allows the blade to spin for a good 3 seconds before it stops. Did not expect cheap bag and inadequate brake for this much money. I would return it, but I need it now so will keep it."
4,See this movie!!,This movie totally freaked me out!! I can't believe that there are people living beneath the city and for so many years! Who knew? I enjoyed watching this film and learning about how these people can survive on next to nothing. I was amazed at how those involved in making the film endured actually being in these tunnels to conduct the interviews and shoot the footage. You have to see this film to believe it!!
3,good for expanding your mind...,"... a little hard on the soul. it's a good watch, just be warned that it's depressing. worth checking it out though."
2,Want to build an electric car ? Not real easy.,"I think Bob Brant really wants to help you build an electric vehicle. I feel, however that his engineering background causes him to ""talk down"" to the reader, who thinks "" It can't be really as complex as all this ! All these formulas , etc ! "" How do we know the ""flux level"" for a motor we buy at a garage sale ? I am too old to get an engineering degree !Lots of ""shade tree"" mechanics ( like me ) will have to look further for more practical information.Such as - a 10 HP motor in a Geo Metro will be fine for trips to the grocery store but no good for highway use. Also errors have crept in, and the schematic diagrams are incomplete and puzzling. Of course, the book was published nine years ago, and technology has advanced in the EV industry, as in everything else"
2,Limited usefulness,"I am interested in a from scratch build, and I have undergraduate level knowledge of EM physics and EE.Very folksy style, lots of preaching. I think the author could assume that anyone reading ""Build Your Own Electric Vehicle"" does not need to be informed about the benefits of driving an EV. The history of the electric car, and speculation about oil availability, also held no interest to me.The meat of the book is essentially a record of two EV builds. Useful, but I do not feel that I got a book's worth of instruction.I found the information about safety cutoffs in the circuits helpful, but did not enjoy the folksy, ""gosh golly you'll be fried like a turkey"" style (not a quotation from the book)."
3,Electric Views,In general I found this book of value as a technical reference volumne but was extremly disappointed in the bias shown toward hybrid vehicles and larger cars of all types and the attitude that EV'S are for short shopping runs and you should use an ICE for anything else. This attitude has been what has slowed the uptake of EV's and kept the creation in the hands of mainly gifted amateurs. Yes I certainly will be using the formulae in the book but will be looking beyond the USA most of the electrics and electronics for my electric touring car
3,too much math and needs updating,"I read the book and especially chapter 11 (actual conversion of the Ranger) I found the math in the book to be beyond my comprehension. I understood the point just to much math and explanation of the math. I have now read two books about converting cars to electric power. This book had more detail than the previous book which on one hand I liked. It would be nice to have an update on the book as this book was written over ten years ago there has been advancement in the areas of AC electric motor, controllers and batteries."
4,Good place to start,"This is a great first book to learn about electric vehicles. It includes history of EVs, design notes and formulas for those interested in predicting the results of a conversion. All written in a clear and understandable fashion, even for the novice, though even those with knowledge of EVs will learn. Lots of information so it takes some time to read, but is well worth it."
1,Out of date,This book was written in the early 90's. It's so out of date that it's almost usless. Whish I had know before I spent $$$.
1,Build Your Own Electric Vehicle,D.C. electric cars only get about 40 miles on average per charge. This book still promotes the D.C. electric car.It has no new noteworthy info on how to get down the road in an A.C. induction multi phase motored car. No gains in the new edition compared to the old. New cover same old story.
4,A great place to start,"This book gives you the information you need to start an electric car project. I'd recommend that you read this before you start your conversion, then use it as a reference book when you go shopping for components. The information is both general and specific. It's current too."
1,Save your time and money,"I'm a pretty easy reviewer, few books I don't like.This one was a waste of time and money. Let me be specific. Where the author could have been less detailed he wasn't where he could have been more detailed he wasn't.I'm doing an EV conversion and I live on a mountain. I don't want to read you'll need a ""little"" more horse power if you live in a hilly area. I want to hear 10%, 20% whatever more.Engines. He says we will start out with AC motors and then launches into electrical engineering speak. His conversions he writes about are DC motored vehicles. Then I go to another electrical engineers website, a guy who has done several conversions and he says DC motors arc and to only use AC. Also, several of the websites that show completed vehicles that used DC motors shown in his conversions (this book) show top speeds of 50 mph.Some people shouldn't write - or teach."
4,Good up to date book on EVs,"This is the first up to date book I've found on EVs in years. This revised edition reflects the current economy, state of oil prices and government regulations regarding EVs. Everything you'd need to get started on an EV project or to just educate yourself on the subject."
3,Academic more than Practical!,"This book discuss the history of Electric cars and their devolution to gasoline! There are a lot of theoretical and physical equations to read thru. Not an issue with me, but I was looking for a source of information where I could reach out to the actual practical approach of implementation. I need an up to date components & sources that are clearly identified with more practical diagrams and sequential steps. This book did not come across in this fashion! Maybe because it was written in the early nineties. Last, step by step photographs are also lacking ..."
3,This author is obsessed with mind maps!,The book is practically a collection of mind maps of various decision trees and other concepts... The text probably is adequate for designing a decent conversion. It's pretty useful if you don't mind the author's quirks.
2,Build your own Electric Vehicle,"I was certain I would like to see how a electric car was constructed but i was disappointedto see actual hands on construction was not shown,basically what the components do and list some sourcesas to where you can get parts or conversion services.I was expecting more from a book with the titleof building an electric vehicle."
2,Outdated,"Bateries and chargers and controler options have changed too much in the last 20 years. Some usful information,but I couldnt find a more updated book."
3,Few changes from the first version,"This is a great guide and the first edition would be rated much higher by me. I consider this to be the best book on conversions. But I was really hoping this second edition would be updated with the many improvements we have seen, especially in battery technology. Unfortunately the authors gave just superficial coverage on new lithium batteries and AC systems. I would say 98% of the book is the first edition."
3,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. It covers the basics of EV building. My main issue with it is that it has become woefully out of date. In the years since it was published, controllers, batteries and motors have all changed for the better. The EVs you could build with this book are too old-school.I am all for the home builder doing their thing, its just that this book needs some updates and links to where you can find the best new controllers, motors, batteries out on the web. If you were wondering what it would take to convert that old 4 banger car into an EV vehicle this book will get you started in the right direction basically.From there you can probably find what you are looking for out on the web. So its a decent source, just realize its a bit dated.Thanks for reading my review."
3,Build Your Own Crusade,"The beginning of the book is ""off target."" It begins with politics and hyperbole: through the end of chapter 3 can be skipped without loosing context (chapter 3 may be of interest to history buffs). Chapter 4 and 5 can be skimmed -- 4 for its tables and pictures of conversions and 5 to get an idea of available sources. Chapters 6-10 provide a significant amount of conversion information: the reader will want to concentrate on these chapters. The last 2 chapters provide some areas of concern that one should think carefully about before a conversion is attempted."
3,Good Product,"I purchases it so that:1. work with my Sony Ericssson Phone + Charger (Don't have to carry 2 different chargers.2. Design was different.Great product. Some problems in audio when spaced slightly further away form the phone. Otherwise, works like a charm."
5,English translation of the Zohar,Beautifully poetic series. I hope that Daniel Matt is able to translate the entire set.
3,"Vikings, Celts and Catholics--oh my!","Author Harald Boehlke was planning a vacation when he discovered the Viking Serpent, beginning with two ""round churches"" on the same longitude. That begins a discussion of spiritual sites, Vikings vs. Celts vs. Catholics, and journeys over beautiful paths and waterways around Norway. What does it all mean? You'll have to make up your own mind."
4,Viking/Celtic connection,The alternative history presented here I'm sure really angers a lot of Christians. This video presents some very interesting theories about a Viking/Celtic connection that are worthy of consideration. I'm always on the lookout for fresh ideas and this didn't disappoint.
4,Beautiful Scenery And Intriguing Theories,"Along with all of the beautiful scenery of Norway in this film, I must say that I learned some pretty interesting theories after watching The Viking Serpent. I had no idea that Viking Kings and the Celtic Church were involved together. It also felt a bit like a scavenger hunt as we explored old castles, caves and monasteries looking for symbols of ""good and evil"". Of course, this documentary doesn't claim to be absolute scientific fact, but it was still interesting hearing the theories presented about snakes, pentagrams and the number 666. I really enjoy films that help the viewer stretch their imagination, and this one certainly did!"
3,Loved this film--maybe not the way it was intended,"Was the world once ruled by a serpent cult? Do they still exist, these Viking/Celtic snake-worshippers? I don't know and I'm not sure I care, but I still found this DVD enjoyable for the fabulous Scandinavian scenery, the romantic history and the feeling of adventure in first-hand discovery.With the documentarians, we explore old castles, monasteries and caves, looking for pentangles and snaky iconography, mostly by sea, since this is how one gets around in Norway.This isn't science, and the ""hidden"" symbols this film claims to uncover seem thin at best, but I enjoyed the journey so much that didn't bother me. Especially for Viking fans, and I don't mean the football team."
3,Questions,This somewhat controversial film boldly looks at the evil lurking in the most unexpected places and history of the Celtic church. Not my beliefs but interesting viewing.
1,The Charleston Days,"A search for ""Savoy Orpheans"" yielded ""The Charleston Days"" title. While it may be a fine CD for fans of Charleston era dance music, it is NOT the Savoy Orpheans. Savoy Orpheans play just three tunes on this CD; the rest are played by other bands. This may not bother some folks, but the person for whom I purchased the CD was greatly disappointed. I can not comment on the quality of the bands, but only advise would-be buyers of the misleading search results."
1,Not about buddhism just a simple history,"You don't learn so much about the Dalai Lama, unless he takes his motivation and habits from his mother, as many of us do. This should not be the first book you read about Buddhism, instead try Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book if you are a beginner and wish to learn about Buddhism. This should be the 30th or later book that you read if you wish to gain knowledge about the lives of Buddhists as ordinary people."
3,...,"I beleave this book was insightful. It was fairly simple to read, and was worded well. however, reading this, and several other books for an honors project, i must say that it takes a different reader to enjoy. i also read invading tibet, which i thought was much more fun to read. Dalai lama my son is a good book, but to me it seemed flat."
1,"Too many simple, old ideas","Too many plain old ideas like one-type-flower arrangements, and small simple ones. Most of the arrangements doesn't look unique nor interesting, much less ""glorious"" as in the book title. There were only 7 or 8 which are truly memorable and unique."
4,Cakewalk Music Creator Great for All Music Lovers,"In my opinion, the Cakewalk Music Creator is one of the best music devolpers made to this day! (The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there has to be room for any better programs that will come out in the future!) With the use of your imagination, creativity, and this program you can create music that you've never dreamed of. Not only does this CD software allow you to upload your own recorded vocal and CD sample, but it lets you mix them with new music. With the the option to make and print out sheet music and the oportunity to create music for home videos or music CDs, this software is perfect for the not-so-professionals and the professionals."
5,My Favorite From the Sampler Disc,I bought a Sirius Light and sound machine..You can find it here on amazon for 99 bucks. Search for: mindplace sirius.As a stand alone cd I can't say. i've never listened to it that way. I have however listened to it with my sirius light and sound machine set on the audiostrobe decoder setting and it's definitely a great experience. I took 3 tablespoons of raw cacao powder put in the cd and layed on my bed for a lil over an hour. It was the trippiest experience I've had in a while.
1,Hmmmm,"Although it sounds fascinating it seems to be just a few ""artists"" making funny noises in a studio to a drum line. Nothing exceptional. After about 10 minutes I wanted my money back..."
1,organize your finances - wish I could,I wish I could review this item - but it would be difficult since I never received the book. Bayfront's response was that they delivered according to the shipper but since no one had to sign for it = they weren't responsible for the fact that I didn't receive it. Pretty poor customer service - let's face it the book cost more to ship that it cost to buy it - a 75 cent book - that they cannot honor.. That is okay - I will find another copy from another website and seller. Thanks for nothing.
3,An Interesting Product of his time,"I find Billy Sunday's sermons to be quaint and amusing (""There was so much sin in this town that God wouldn't touch it with rubber gloves."") Particularly his ""John Barleycorn"" anti-alcohol sermon and his tirades against modern culture (the lines about ""Stinking socialists"" are quite a hoot!). Billy Sunday's sermons worked well at a time when the masses of Americans were poorly educated and needed the hellfire and brimstone-school of religion to keep them from getting drunk, beating their spouses, and fornicating (but no sermons against lynching, financial exploitation, segregation, or the Ku Klux Klan which were also major evils of that era?). Sadly, many people still go along with this sort of thing and only theologians with the most backward congregations still preach in this fashion. For those with modern minds, it's good entertainment."
4,This music by bandleader Paul Whiteman is excellent.,"This music, brought into the future, seems like today those who enjoy Mr. Whiteman's music are in a wonderful journey through time. Such hits as 'Whispering,''The Japanese Sandman,'and 'Nola' deserve high regards today (probably even more) than they were praised seventy years ago. I would even go beyond the 'four star'catagory, but yes, there is at least one or two songs that maybe could been avoided on the album's release. Thanks again for the great music Paul Whiteman."
5,"Outstanding, a must-have!","This is an amazing book, it immediately made it into my personal cookbook top ten. The photos are nice, the recipes work out perfectly, everything tastes great.This may well become the first cookbook, where eventually I will have tried every single recipe. (I've already cooked my way more than halfway through...)"
3,Lot's of Promise,"Beautiful woman kidnapped, forced on a cross country trip by mule & by foot. Suffered rape, humiliation, & maybe a bit of Stockholm Syndrome before being rescued. She trades her body for their assistance, revenge & eventual release back to her loving, rich father.Transfer is not very good but watchable. I watched it with the subtitles.This is NOT an explicit movie, for those hoping for one.Would have given it a better rating had the quality of the film been improved upon. Dont just take any print you can find & burn a disc. Clean it up."
3,No Point,"While I think Pacino did a great job and steals the movie as a gambling addict running a gambling business, I can't help but to wonder what was accomplished with this movie. There was certainly no big story ideas other than to be a character driven piece. The problem with that is Pacino was the only interesting character to me. Another movie that shows the rise and fall of the next big thing in a shady business Boiler Room was much more interesting to me because of a cast of wonderfully written characters. This movie did not do it for me."
2,Not What I Expected,Expected dried silvery little fish (1 to 2 inch) that I've found before and that both cats liked. These are yellowed pieces that appear to be explosively vacuum dried. Texture is different. One cat eats them but the other won't touch them.
2,Cats were not impressed,"I have three Himalyans, all turned their noses up at this treat offerring. The cat reviewers were not impressed with the texture or the portion size.However, I believe the feral strays in our neighborhood may have enjoyed them."
2,still waiting for my soil....,"i have my moss ready, my charcoal, my pebbles and plants. but still waiting on the soil. ordered it exactly 7 days ago. if i knew my soil would be bouncing around utah for an entire week, i would have just gotten it at the local plant nursery. supposed to come within the next 2 days. sell waiting....."
4,Outline of a larger work,It has the essence of Terence Wade's larger book: A Comprehensive Russian Grammer. It is pocket-sized and written clearly.and I have been thru it several times.
2,Baen should be ashamed,"This anthology only contained *1* new story, the rest were recycled from earlier anthologies. It was an overstuffed vehicle for Weber's new work, which was mediocre at best. The man simply made the tank into a really tough soldier, which isn't what Bolos are. They're noble, honorable, hard to understand, prone to acting without orders, and generally the baddest asses around. And we're going to have to suffer through an entire *novel* like this???"
3,Only 1 orginal story in the bunch,I was rather disappointed in this book. All but ONE of the stories in this book are reprints!!! BOOO!On the otherhand I will give David Weber a big hand for the first story in the book about the Bolo Nike. It was a wonderful tail.On the whole i was rather disappointed with this book and the amazing disreguard for the reader.
2,Moab Ventilators by Merrell,"I have worn this style of Merrell shoe for 10 years - probably 10 pair. This pair ran at least 1/2 size small and the toe box is nowhere as roomy as the prior pairs. I imagine it is a function of the Chinese taking over production. Unfortunately, I didn't believe what my feet were telling me for a week. I now will be donating this pair to Goodwill rather than sending them back for an exchange.No more Merrells for me through the mail."
1,Oh man my heel hurts!,"This my third pair of Merrells They made my left heel ache terribly. I have never had that symptom before. After a month or orthotics, taping with no relief , I went back to my old shoes, very similar Gore Tex Moab and no pain. I feel these shoes are defective and will pursue at least a partial refund. Apparently not all Merrells are equal."
2,Merrell gave me poor customer service.,"The shoes are ok but be careful of the laces. I needed to replace mine and contacted Merrell customer service. They were completely unhelpful. They told me that the only laces they carried were listed on their website (these are not listed) or I could get them on the internet at shoelacesexpress (they don't have these laces either). In my opinion, you are better off buying New Balance or some other brand that provides better support."
1,Merrell Moab Ventilators,I bought these because I have worn the Jungle Mocs for several years. To say the least I am disappointed in these shoes. The just are not as comfortable as I was expecting. I can only wear them about 1 day and my feet are sore so I change into another pair for the next day. I would not do these shoes again.
2,Not as good as expected :-(,"Tried the shoes mostly based on reviews, unfortunately the right one hurts my toe a little bit, I don't know why or how is simply not symmetrical inside. :-( Never happened with any other kind of shoes. Will ask for a refund."
3,"Nice style, wrong size",I like the style of these shoes but they are about half size smaller than other Merrell shoes I purchased in the past. They are light weight which makes them feel a little on the cheap side. I will wear them even though they are a little cramped and see if the may loosen up a little.
5,"If it's Merrell, it's the Best!",This is the second pair of Merrell Moab Ventilator for my husband. He like's them enough to replace them with the same shoe. I think that should tell you how good it is. Excellent support.
4,Afghan rugged,"So far so good, lightweight, comfy and durable. They have a well made feel and were hard to beat for the price. Many folks (expatriots wear them). Not many complaints, only time will tell. Had to have them sent home first, then here so i dont have anything else for now. More to follow later."
5,"Great shoes, would buy again.","Per usual, Amazon's shipping was phenomenal...actually got the shoes earlier than they'd posted originally on the website for projected shipping dates.When I first got these, was a little worried they'd fit too tightly (I wear a 13D), but once I wore them for a few days, no complaints.I only use these to walk around in, as my ""hiking"" is limited here in Afghanistan, but...I hope to try them out on a little more rugged terrain at some point.Love the shoes, very comfortable, and I don't even feel the mini-boulders that pass for gravel around here."
5,my husband loves them,Very comfortable-he wears them every day-his last pair of Merrell lasted more than 3 years. He will buy Merrells again.
4,Good looking comfortable shoe,A lot's been written about these so I'll keep it brief. They are comfortable and I like the styling. Only one real complaint: the inner velour-like fabric creates a lot of friction against cotton socks and tends to pull them down and cause them to bunch up. Older Merrell shoes I've owned had a smarter nylon mesh pattern inside that didn't do this. This velour is already starting to pill up after just a few wearings and I can easily see it wearing away after a short time. These ran a little small for me and I had to order a size 12 instead of my usual 11-1/2.
3,Too small,I purchased these shoes due to the high rating. First of all they are a full size smaller than I usually wear. I compared them to the shoes I was wearing. The Merrell 14 is exactly the same as my other 13s. Even though I bought the size larger my feet still feel somewhat tight in them. I have no doubt that they are of better quality than most of the Chinese shoes but they do not live up to their reputation. I am a diabetic and have a slight problem with my feet. These seem to be possibly some better than most of my shoes but not significantly.
4,Great shoe but not perfect,"I love the fit and finish of this shoe. It is very comfortable on any surface I have tried it on, including going over rocks and boulders (dry ones at leas). It suffers one serious flaw though. It has terrible traction on wet surfaces. While out hiking, you inevitably will encounter wet surfaces. For an outdoors shoe, I expect that it would have better wet traction."
2,shoe sizing is wrong,"I have found that these shoes are just to small, as in to short. I do not have an issue with the width. Every shoe I own is a size 11. When hiking on level surfaces they seem a touch short, but when hiking on hills, the downhill portion of the hike is miserable. I did not return them within the required time frame. My error. I would suggest a trial fit at a local retailer to ensure your ordering the right size"
1,Buy something else.,"This is the most disappointing shoe I've ever owned. They felt great when I got them and for the first few wears I was happy. But, I've grown to hate these shoes. Here's why:-After a couple weeks, part of the stitching on one of them totally came undone.-They are uncomfortable as all get out. They have wierd uncomforta points that were not evident when I tried them on.-The Vibram soles don't give your feet good, even support. They are awkward for balance. Mine has an inexplicable lack of support under my middle 3 right toes, and therefore they will go numb if I walk in these things for about 1/2 an hour straight.-Ventilator? Yeah right. This is bar none the sweattiest shoe I have ever worn, and caused me to develop foot fungus.Avoid."
1,Worst Boot Ever,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! This is the worst boot I have ever worn on my feet. I bought them because they claimed to be waterproof which is a necessity in my line of work. Within one week they were filled with water, the treads on the sole were already showing signs of major deterioration, and the outer seams were already coming undone. I was most disappointed with the waterproofing. I could wear sandals in the rain and not get as soaked as I was in these boots. I will never buy a Merrell product again."
5,Epic Military Footwear,"These are great. I deploy to alot of hot and arid regions like Iraq, Kuwait, Kenya, Uganda, Afghanland. The mesh makes it real easy for your feet to to breath. I remember my first deployment, I used to just wear my Army boots with my 5.11 pants, and my feet would be nasty at the end of a 12 to 15 hour day, but these are great, no slip, more comfortable than a boot, great for hiking, and a lot of breath to them. I suggest them to any forward located military personnel that doesn't wear typical combat uniforms for their day to day job. About to get my new pair in any day now, normally Amazon has great shipping times, but where I am right now, mail takes forever, but I can't blame that on the retailer or Amazon, so I won't reflect upon that in my rating."
5,Great Shoe for Fat Feet,"I have a problem with sports shoes that do not fit because the manufacturer refuses to acknowledge that people have different size feet. Thank you Merrell!! These shoes are the best. The transaction was fast, smooth, and uneventful."
5,Great Knock Around Shoe for the weekends,"I saw this shoe at the local REI store in Rockville, MD. Problem was, they were out of the 10 1/2EE shoe but had the boot style so I could try it on. The boot fit perfectly but I wanted the shoe.After getting home I went onto Amazon to look for this shoe and there it was, a few dollars cheaper but still, they had it in my size. Ordered it, and I had it within a few days (kudos to the company that shipped it). Tried them on when I got home and again, a perfect fit. I wore them that weekend and they are my new weekend shoes. Fit is right on the money, quality is excellent."
2,Ventilators don't ventilate!,"I love all my other Merrell shoes. These, however did not meet expectations. Very comfortable out of the box, I immediately noticed that my feet were hot. After about a week of limited wear, they started stinking. Please know that I'm a little freaky about wearing clean socks and having clean feet--and even my wife says I'm the only dude she knows who never has smelly feet. But not in these shoes. They're hot, and they don't breathe. After wearing them on a long flight, I took them off to come through security and was embarrassed! Whew they stink! And they're less than two weeks old. Thankfully, I was able to return them (don't ask me how)!Don't buy."
3,OK...not great,"These shoes are OK....but not exceptional. I like sandals that cover the toes, wrap around the back of the heel and don't require me to fasten/unfasten anything to take them on or off. This shoe does all of that. However, the sole is unnaturally stiff and, though not 'uncomfortable', it's not exactly comfortable either. It is a good enough shoe, but I'd advise you to keep looking. The seller did an outstanding job delivering it in a timely manner and at a good price.....so, thumbs up to them :-)"
1,Their sizing needs redone.....,"I ordered a pair, and the feel like the were made for a toddler. If you order these, go up one size and hope you don't have to contact Merrell. Their customer service is non existent. Can't return, so I gave them to a kid next door. Back to Teva's for me!"
5,Very good buy,"I am sold on Merrells. I have them in brown and have to say, very comfortable. Wear them walking on the street and on trails. They even got me through 2 weeks in France. Get a pair with ortholite insoles. It could be me but I felt a difference over regular Merrell insoles. They are very light. If you trail run, then I don't know how they would last, but for me, they are great. The wife won't wear any other brand."
2,Not happy,"I have had Merrell's before - this style. For some reason, this one has changes. The heel cup is VERY narrow and not at all comfortable - and I don't have big feet. I may give them another shot but this batch isn't quite up to snuff."
3,"Great Shoes, Bad Laces","The shoes are extremely comfortable and rugged, but the laces break down and need to be replaced after about a month."
2,"Fits great, sucks to hike in",I do a lot of hiking and needed new shoes and my girlfriend bought me the Merrell Moab Ventilators. I tried them on and liked them. I wore them around for a few days and then felt great. The ventilation is great if your feet get hot. They also give great support.The problem lies in taking them off road. First your feet will always be wet from the first mud puddle you meet. The next problem is they are slick on wet anything. I am petty surefooted but in these I fall at least 3 or four times per hike. If I just wear sneakers or work boots I'm fine. Kind of really sucks because I can't even really wear them as water shoes unless I plan to send a lot of time falling all over the place.If you are just looking for shoes to wear around town buy these; if you plan to hike up a mountain get something else.
5,This is My Fourth Pair,"I have been wearing this shoe for hiking and backpacking in Missouri and Arkansas. It's a lightweight, stable, comfortable platform for day hiking or when I have a full pack for overnight trips. Breathable, and flexible, I have even done a 5-mile trail run in these. You can't go wrong with this shoe. I have gotten away from trying to fit heavy, traditional hiking boots. If you insist on an over-the-ankle boot, the Moab comes in a high top. I wear size 10 to 10.5 in most shoes. 10.5 is what has been working in this shoe."
4,Of interest to designers and non-designers,"This book, considered an important work by many, was out of print for some years. Dover has recently republished it which is great for students of design.It's easy to read and points to the rich ideas Moholy-Nagy wanted to share with the world."
3,Quality,"As it is quality for money, the quality of the video is another question, the first disc 'Hoosier Schoolboy' is dark and very grainy, obviously has'nt been enhanced in any way for dvd production, the other movies seem to be fine, would'nt call it top quality3/5"
3,"Great toy, not so practical","My daughters love this personal video player. It is great for use in the car, or waiting situations with young kids. However it is so limited in that you can only use the videonow discs of shows with it. I would recommend getting a small personal dvd player instead."
4,Works well - here are some tips you may need to know.,"When I first tried this pump, it didn't work at all. Upon opening it, I found excessive grease that was clogging the impeller vanes and both the intake and output ports. After removing some of the grease and reassembling the pump, it worked but barely. The output was pretty anemic and it couldn't pump water if the intake hose was more than a couple inches in length. I then switched drills from my cordless drill to a corded electric drill which turns much faster. The electric drill did the trick providing a strong output. So if you experience problems, you might want to try the above procedures. Once it's working, it works well."
1,"Piece of garbage, don't waste your money",If I was able to give this a half star I would have. Poor design with the impellors. First time I used the pump the impellor tore off. I called Wayne and they sent me a new one. Used this one twice and the impellor tore off. Pure garbage !
4,Good Info but lacked in some area's,"This is a good book in terms of getting started in making beats. The information in the back of the book is key to connecting with the right organizations to do business with for your music. The only problem I had is that it seem to be based around certain pieces of gear (s950 and Mpc60/2000) If another edition is written, it should be based on general principles and posible diagrams to explain the concept being discussed.Everyone doesn't have the same gear but the principles are universal. Other than that, I recommend buying this book. Knowledge is power and having it in your library would make a fine addition. You can refer to it and it will clear some confusion in making beats. This is just some constructive criticism. keep writing SA'ID"
2,Good as an autobiography,"This book takes you through the life of an urban music producer, how he acquired his knowledge of beat machines, samplers, and sequencers and parlayed that into a career in Hip-Hop and Rap music. It is a good autobiography but not a strong technical reference. Written on an elementary level at best, too much simplicity here in how to get things done. Reading a manual for a sampler will give a lot more technical information than the author can explain. Sa'id has provided a few notable chapters for the wannabe beat master. A discography of late 20th century pop for those who want to hear good production values, and a chapter on contracts including the necessary forms for getting signed and making money on your creations. I suggest this book for beginners in addition to a subscription to Modern Recording, Mix, Computer Musician, and Electronic Musician. Skip this book if you aren't a beginner, but get if if you are!"
5,A First Class Read For Anyone Interested In Hip Hop-Rap Production,"I've been looking for a book, tutorial, and/or video that was directly about REAL Hip Hop production... Well, the search is over. I came across this book, ""BeatTips Manual: Some Insight on Producing Hip Hop-Rap Beats and Music"", and I was BLOWN away. I just sat down and read the whole book in one sitting. I've been producing music for a while, and I still picked up some MAJOR GEMS in this book. There were a number of things that I thought I already understood. After reading BeatTips, I realized how much I didn't understand about Hip Hop production. I think that his book should be a required read for all Hip Hop production in schools, and any online Hip Hop production threads. Keep up the good work, Sa'id, I hope you drop another book, cause you did a hell of a job, man. Not only was it very informative, but it kept my interest with your personal stories, as well. This book is an A+! First class reading all the way. Nicely done."
3,Don't let the title deceive you,"This book should be categorized with sexual identity and sexual politics not sexual intimacy or ""how to excite and trill your partner"". I think the fact that it is paired with ""The Fine Art of Erotic Talk"" is really quite ridicules these two books are on opposite sides of the spectrum--and yes I bought them both.Tisdale does make some good observations, but her points are not well organized one chapter bleeds into another with out clear definition or resolve.I agree with many of the positions taken by Tisdale; however few were ground breaking or original. This may be a good general introduction to sexual politics, but it left this reader wanting more."
4,A source for Jane Austen,"How many readers know that Jane Austen's title ""Pride and Prejudice"" is actually a quotation from Fanny Burney's ""Cecilia""? Perhaps Austen even meant her readers to read her novel in the light of the earlier one. ""Cecilia"" is interesting, a novel about a man and woman both of whom need to unbend to come together. It reflects well the interest in moral and psychological intensity in its time and helps dispel the notion that women writers were not taken seriously in their time. This is a once-a-decade read but well worth the effort."
5,bought extra,"I bought extra bags not wanting to not be able to use the dust extractor that I bought, I have used the machine a lot in my small shop and the bag is not letting dust into the air, great purchase"
4,Best bang for your buck,"These speakers probably aren't going to turn any heads, but for the price they are well worth it. Pioneer always delivers the best bang for your buck, and these speakers sound excellent. I was very impressed with them, and if all you want is great sounding audio for a great price, look no further.Most of my audio equipment is Pioneer for these exact reasons, and as until I can afford the best these are by far good enough.Bottom line, uless you're a perfectionist audiophile or simply need earth-shattering audio, get these speakers."
1,Wrong item received,"I ordered a Kodak U-5A cable and received a mini USB instead.I emailed Cmple several times and only received vague answers.Was creditted with only the returned item, not the shippingto/from costs. Am awaiting the 2nd order. A very frustratingexperience."
5,Fabulous Product,"This is one of the best products I have found for my dry skin. I'm a redhead and suffer greatly, especially in the winter months--to the point of getting cracked fingertips which take months and months to heal. Gly-Miracle really helps, and a little goes a long way. I've been using it for over five years."
5,Wonderful story,This is a wonderful story about characters we can all relate to. Libby Thom has a great first novel. Keep writing! Skleine
1,Very tedious,"Unfortunately Ms. Thom has created a tedious and somewhat boring tale that could have been much better had she spent more time on characterization, plot and setting."
5,my favorite,"well i own it . to begin with i bought it cause i thought the cover page might of some use to enlarge the painting and remove titel and i started reading it, its most absorbing book i have ever read it . but what i liked the most is the end . its really tragic on the first reading and it left me feeling empty not for days but weeks but then on second thought it was the most suitable as far as the rest of the story is concerned . I dont know wheather a matuaer reader should do it but i think its of the kind of or comparable with great classicks like gone with the wind , may be i am to young to give comment like that but i liked the book very much"
5,Great product!,The cup came exactly as described. It came early and in good condition. High quality and seemed durable. Great toddler gift! Would buy again!
2,Training,"My expectations that this DVD would more fully address training methods - primarily use of the hands and body positions were not met. I was disappointed that this was more a glossy exhibition of him working with different horses and never showed the step by step process of how he achieved the end results. While I would definitely not rate this as a training video, I would say that it has some nice philosophy and wisdom and displays some interesting horses. I saw nothing in this video for the avid horseman looking to improve his way with horses and for this reason I'm not certain that it held great worth in a serious horseperson's library."
5,Baseball When It Was A Game--Great Nostalgia,"Do you get a chill when you see names like Ruth, Cobb, and Gehrig in an actual box score--a box score from a bygone era that omits runs-batted-in and sometimes even times at bat? Have you ever heard about the ""Merkle boner,"" Walter Johnson's dramatic first world series victory (in relief!), unknown Howard Ehmke starting a world series game instead of the great Lefty Grove and setting a strikeout record against the heavy-hitting Chicago Cubs (yes, the Cubs), Pete Reiser's Dodgers heading toward a pennant, Tinker to Evers to Chance? If so, you'll love this well-written, nostalgic look at baseball the way it used to be (before 1945). Though these first-person accounts were written by leading sportswriters of that era, the personalities of the players come through clearly. Some old-time (if occasionally fuzzy) pictures add to the fun. Highly recommended."
1,Protocol Dictionary,"The title of this book should have been ""Protocol Dictionary"". There is almost NOTHING in this book about configuring Cisco routers. It does however explain every protocol known to man in bit and byte detail. I'm not studying for a Phd in networking, I just want to get my router working and this book was useless for that purpose. It's copyright 2001 which is completely obsolete in 2009."
2,too many ads,"some interesting stories, but too much junk and advertisements. You have to search for the articles you can actually read."
1,Fast Buck for Fast Company with a Fast Resolution,"I bought a One Year subscription to Fast Company on December 26, 2009. The first two issues received from Fast Company a couple of weeks later were back issues....November 2009 and December/Janaury 2009/2010. The latest back issue came out three weeks prior to my order, and I had already read both. The address label indicated that the ""One Year"" subscription would expire with the October 2010 issue. In essence, I got a 10 month (9 issue) subscription for One Year dues. I complained to Fast Company and to their credit, they adjusted the expiration date to provide me with the full 11 issues."
1,Unprofessional and Bad Business Practice,"I paid them for one old sample copy they sent, but they never acknowledged it and kept pestering me with invoices (""collection notices"") of magazines that they never delivered. These notices sound like extortion:"".... But if we do not hear back from you within 10 days, we'll have to place your name in our permanent ""Delinquent File"" and suspend all future credit privileges with our company. Why jeopardize your credit with us for such a small amount of money? Instead, please return the invoice above with your payment now and keep your credit in good standing.....Sincerely, Pat Harrington, Credit Manager""Here is a link I'm going to next, [...]"
3,Not easy,"Ordered as a gift. The order process was confulsing, and never reached the recipient. I'm sure the magazine itself is great."
2,"Used to be good, now just flash in the pan","Used to be good, but now just flashy fluff. Little real content to interest or help anyone serious about starting their own business."
2,Remixed into mediocrity.,"If you're after the EP collection of songs, do yourself a favor and get each individual album instead of getting this highlights collection. Having listened to and loved the individual recordings (Speed Graphic, Sunny 16, Super D), I was highly disappointed to find that throughout the entire collection they've made rearrangements, re-recordings, and other changes that just take the shine right off the song. Get Your Hands Off... for example has new vocals that don't fit the tone of the song at all, and other songs have had extra unnecessary bass tracks and more tacked onto them. It really destroys the ""raw"" feeling of the original collection."
3,"Ehhh, whatever","Being a huge fan of Ben's last 2 albums (Rockin' the Suburbs and Songs for Silverman), I just had to hear Supersunnyspeedygraphic. I've listened to the entire album about 4 times now and only 1 song has been worth the repeat button in my stereo. Ehh, it's ok, but, Ben, stick to the big releases. They get more attention from your producer."
1,Ben's Shot,"I loved Ben Folds Five, Ben's CD's since the breakup of the Fantastic 5 have gotten worse and worse, he has lost his edge and is too full of himself, making fun of people is cute when your an up and coming new band, but the routine is old. This CD is just o.k."
3,"Not the best Ben Folds ever, just the best released this month.","With a great, Krupa-esque drum groove and swingin' horns, ""Rent a Cop"" is a blast. ""All U Can Eat"" is another story. Where the earlier ""Uncle Walter"" was real, knowing, and very funny, ""All U can Eat"" is the kind of smug, simplistic cant about SUVs and Wal-Mart that you'd expect to hear from the tote-baggers down at Starbucks - but the music is cool. Interesting covers - ""Bitches"" is amazing and weird as Folds proves that the emotional content of a song comes at least as much from the music as from the lyrics.Yeah, it gets a 3, but remember: A Ben Folds 3 is most people's 5."
4,Where the heck are,"Wandering and Kalamazoo? These are the works of genius needed to spark this baby. Kalamazoo is particularly eclectic and sad... or at least give us the original Give Judy my NoticeAdelaide is great stuff as is Rent a Cop and Bruised and Still, and B**ches is hilarious, but this compilation feels like and odds and sods. Still any Folds is good Folds. Full SuperD EP is highly recommended"
3,Great for what it is,"Ben Folds single-handedly proved that good music can be successfully released online with his series of internet-only EPs, but at the last minute decided to release his best tracks from the experiment as 'Supersunnyspeedgraphic.' Consequently, this truly is more of a compilation of tracks, more than a single, cohesive work. Folds' case isn't helped by the fact help that a whopping one-third of the tracks are covers, albeit very good ones. Connected it's not, but 'Supersunnyspeedgraphic' is still full of fantastic songwriting, unexpected covers, and mind-blowing piano playing.Standout tracks: Bruised, Rent A Cop, There's Always Someone Cooler Than You"
2,Betty Crocker Deluxe,Not nearly as easy to enter recipes as old Betty Crocker program. Instructions are poor.
1,avoid this and don't buy cd,"We purchased a cd to use this program a year ago. Struggled with the bad user interface to enter in a lot of recipes. Now it starts telling us we only have a trial version and to activate our copy at an additional cost of $75.00! Trying for support using the online system and e-mail yields no response. Calling their toll free number gets a can't connect. Calling their local Utah number gets voice mail saying to keep costs down, use their web site and e-mail with no option to ever speak to a live person. Total ripoff."
2,Wrong region,I don't know a lot about region codes but went to play the DVD and couldn't watch it because it said wrong region. So I am in the process of trying to overcome this problem without having to buy a new DVD player. So it is a bit difficult at this stage to give any feedback.
3,"Better to pick up ""The Beguiled"" alone and call it a day","The gem of the lot is ""The Beguiled"" (1970), the only 4 or 5 star movie in the bunch. ""Cheesy"" does do justice to the others, though there is ""rotten stench"" cheesy, as in ""The Eiger Sanction"" (1 star), and then ""cheesy enough to put on crackers"" - these don't offend, and they even have mild curio value: ""Coogan's Bluff"" (3 stars), and ""Play Misty For Me"" (3.5 stars). As I said, they don't offend, but then they don't much impress either. The 5 star reviews here are not for the movies themselves but for the production of the DVD set."
3,Not all the movies were there,"I was supposed to get Coogan's bluff, but it was not in the package. The other 3 movies were there, but not Coogan's bluff. If you want Coogan's Bluff, don't buy this DVD."
2,"Clint, Clint & more Clint","Hard to beat the price for 4 movies. However, three out of the 4 movies on this dvd are not worth watching. They're actuallly very cheesy & sort of comical."
4,Clint Eastwood: American Icon Collection,"Play Misty For Me is a great thriller, up there with Alfred Hitchcock! The other movies in the collection are enjoyable."
4,Finally Anamorphic.,"This group of 4 movies are not Clint's greatest, but they are all finally done widescreen anamorphic.This is a big improvement in picture quality. The sound is good , but still just mono. Same audio/video quality as the previous ""Western Icon Collection"". My favorite in this group is ""The Eiger Sanction"", been waiting a long time for a decent presentation, and it's finally here and bargain priced."
4,nice collection,"A good collection of his early films, including his first time as a director. Not much extra beyond the films except for a well done segment interviewing him about his role as a first-time director. an excellent segment, making the collection worth purchasing if you have seen all the films."
4,"Good Movies, Bargain Basement Cost.","My wife and I have been enjoying watching Clint Eastwood movies and we found this ""American Icon Collection"" of four of his movies (Play Misty for Me, The Eiger Sanction, Coogan's Bluff and The Beguilded). I don't regard this as a collection of Eastwood's better movies, but all are quite good entertainment. Plus, as packaged, the movies cost only a little over four dollars each and to get high quality movies at this price is indeed a bargain.I reviewed each of the movies separately, so I see little need to go back over the reviews here since you can get my thoughts by going to any of the titles. My favorite was ""Play Misty for Me. ""My least favorite was ""The Beguiled."" ""Coogan's Bluff would rank second and ""The Eiger Sanction"" third. I gave Misty five stars and the other three four. Any of the movies are excellent, it only a matter of individual taste in the ranking. The main benefit here is a package of very good movies at a bargain basement cost.Gary Peterson"
4,Solid collection of Eastwood films,"This collection of 4 Clint Eastwood films from the late '60s and early '70s are not among his most memorable, but are certainly solid movies at a great price. (""Play Misty For Me"" alone is worth the cost of the package, in this reviewer's humble opinion.) The other three films in this collection are ""The Beguiled"" (a very underrated movie), ""Coogan's Bluff"" (which begat the TV series starring Dennis Weaver called ""McCloud""), and the often dissed, ""The Eiger Sanction"". Longtime director, Don Seigle directs ""The Beguiled"" and ""Coogan's Bluff"" (and has a cameo in ""Play Misty For Me"") and Eastwood directs ""Play Misty For Me"" (his first as a director) and ""The Eiger Sanction"".Long on action, but short on great dialogue, each film can stand alone on its merits. Bring on the popcorn because this collection will make for a good weekend of movie watching."
3,these aren't as good as I'd hoped,I saw Eiger Sanction for the first time a few years ago and thought it was a pretty cool lesser known Clint film. This time around it nearly put me to sleep.Coogan's Bluff is fairly well done but Clint's character is kind of a tool -but I guess that was cool for back then.Haven't gotten to The Beguiled yet and Play Misty for Me is probably the best all around movie and most well known one on this collection.
3,Nothing I haven't heard before,"Not a very impressive book. It is all advice you have heard/read before. No real practical help. Just a lot of ""You should & You should nevers"". There are lots of better options out there. Try something by Adele Faber instead."
5,A Welcome Addition to LGBT Documentaries,"A wonderful film that takes you on a journey from the beginning stages of putting together a special event. RISE UP AND SHOUT celebrates the voices and creative spirits of young gay and lesbian performer. We get to go behind the curtain, and get to know the performers-where they come from, their dreams and what they hope to become. The individual stories are inspiring, as well as the entire venture. The film is a celebration of youth and the voices of a new generation of LGBT performers."
1,Not a good introduction,"I do not recommend this book if you are new to gmake. It breaks the unwritten golden rule that new concepts should not be introduced using more advanced concepts not introduced until later. Makes sense doesn't it? Yet this book does it all the time. I found myself many times having to skip forward to look something up, only to have to skip forward again to look something else up. And by that time I needed knowledge of all the material skipped. Chicken and egg. There's a hole in my bucket.I found it very frustrating.Moreover, you will need to be proficient in sed and awk to understand some important examples. You will need familiarity with lexer.This book may serve as a look-up manual for someone already familiar with make. But if you want to learn the tool for the first time, this is not a good place to start."
3,"Good as a basis, but there are much more tricks!","In general I like the book and the way it is written. It gives a good introduction into all the aspects of make.However I wonder how many large projects have been handled by the guy and how much he knows about some stuff. Two examples from the top of my head. He know no usage for the '::' operator, while for example building a clean target from different areas of the makefile is a great example!Secondly he describes a while loop for doing a recursive make that does not stop when a sub-make fails, while adding a simple ""set -e"" would do that perfectly fine!"
3,Managing Projects with GNU Make,"I believe this book to be a thin, enough to get you started, overview. Worth it if you are just getting started but not a good resource for the veteran"
5,Gives hope and guidance to the caring parent,For those who see that virtue is a gift from God and want to do all they can to help their children hold on to that gift this book is very helpful. It will guide you as you continue to keep the lines of communication open with your children as they mature. It is not just theory but practical.
4,A big help!,"This is an excellent book to help parents put the act in its Christianperspective. I appreciated that unhealthy practices are labeled as such. TheLaHayes are very clear, yet modest writers. Bless them!"
1,Taleban mind control,Another great contribution to litterature from the religious reich.The real question one wonders is why they bothered since it clearly isn't going to suceed commercially or as propaganda. The only people who will claim this book has changed their lives will have been firmly of the faith before.
5,Fab,"Does the job and has great sound as an addition to the clock radio by Tivoli. The cherry cabinet matches the furniture nicely. The clock itself: not the best, probably, but it does what it should... keeps time well! The light does not bother me at all. It is dim enough."
2,An academic hatchet job,"This book provides copious new archival material discovered by the author in England and Italy regarding Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. However, the uses to which professor Nelson has applied his discoveries are mostly unscholarly. Every chapter in this new biography (the first by B.M. Ward was published in 1928) seems designed to undermine the reputation of Oxford, from his management of money and his friends to his poetry, his theatrical and literary patronage, even the grammar and spelling used in his private letters! A strange combination of excellent research and polemics."
1,Ridiculous Hatchet Job,"I personally do not think that there is even a single instance where Nelson considered the most fair minded treatment of the ""evidence"" he cited. And many of his interpretations verge on the absurd.The motivation for Nelson's ""biography"" was clearly to discredit the Oxfordian claim and not surprisingly is a transparent hatchet job. It is riddled with errors and the author has refused to acknowledge or correct them. Nelson also has both no credentials as either a historian or biographer.Do not waste your time or money on this monstrous book."
5,Lovely Ella,This is a wonderful nostalgia trip. She is wonderful and so are her duets with Duke and Stan.
2,XP Great! But - No support for Win 7 or Mac,"Used often with old XP laptop and worked wonderfully. Just like an office unit. Can't use it anymore though.Have a Win 7 laptop and a Mac now. C100S has limited marginal functionality from generic drivers, but performs poorly and is truly featureless.Polycom support is flippant. Advised me to submit a feature request on first go, and said same on escalation.It's too bad because C100S could provide superior control, calling audio and mic."
1,No good if drivers don't work; no customer support,Very erratic performance with WinXP; had to return unit. Polycom has no customer support at all so you're left to Google search to figure out how to fix problems. A friend also has severe problems with his C100S.
2,Great but no Vista support,"Working under XP I really liked this device. But if you use or change to Vista, forget it! From the Polycom website ""Current Communicator C100S software supports Windows XP only. Support for Windows Vista operating systems is planned for Late 2008."" So, for the rest of this year (*if* Polycom sticks to its schedule!) this is a boat anchor for most of the PCs shipped today (and for the past year)."
1,Not Vista compatable,it seems like it would be a good product but unfortunaly the advertisement didn't inform me that it only works with XP.
2,"Great Idea, but I am not recommending this product...","Just spent several hours testing the C100S and it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.If the C100S is to be used together with Mac using OS X or a Windows Machine using Vista or Windows 7 I am not recommending the C100S.1. The Polycom XP drivers did not adjust microphone gain properly, so when you are just 1 meter away from the unit the party at the other end would hear nothing.2. Tried it on VISTA, under Mac OS X (10.5.6) and on Windows 7 Beta without any software where it acts like a regular microphone and the build audio software adjusted volume to reasonable level however no echo cancellation so not really usable for conference calls.Rumors are that Polycom got a Vista Beta Driver version, but apparently one need to request the driver direct from Polycom support.So unless Polycom starts to work on drivers for Vista, Windows and Mac OS X I cannot recomemnd the C100S to others. I am returning the device..."
2,"great device, but no drivers for vista","I bought this in 2007 with hope that drivers for vista are around the corner. Still nothing, even though polycom promised them in 2008.Bad, very bad."
3,ommunicator Grey C100S USB Speakerphone for Skype,"The voice from the skype speaker phone sounds good, but limited with the current design. It would be better off if the volume can be increased more.-albert"
1,Mac Unfriendly,"I am quite suprised that Amazon does not provide a warning in the product description that this device works only on a PC and is oriented towards XP specifically. Well, not only does it not work on the Mac OS, it will not run, as far as I can tell, under Parallels (software the emulates a PC on the Mac). If you are a Mac user.... stay away."
3,Bait and Switch by Polycom,"When I purchased this product, the Polycom website said that Mac support was coming mid 2007.Mid 2007, the site was updated to say that Mac support would be coming late this year.Now, the site says Mac support is not planned.---I have purchased 5 of these in anticipation of Mac support.I will not trust this company ever again."
4,great purchase,"I got to test drive this product while in London, thanks to a co-worker. I fired up Skype and it worked right away. I didn't even install the program that came with it that integrates it.once I bought it I installed the Polycomm program and you had instant Skype integration and awesome sound quality. There are a couple usabilty things I modified (which made me give it a 4 stars instead of 5).I have now used this with Yahoo voice chat and Google with great success. You don't get feedback, the mic is pretty directional and the speaker quality better than good. You cant press it too far to get excellent.So a good purchase for the road warrior that wants hands free VOIP ability. It comes with a nice bag and even a Skype coupon"
5,Polycom,"Unit worked fine for my purposes, which is a simple hands-free audio system to use instead of wearing headphones. Great for people with hearing aids. You won't have headphones pressing down on your hearing aid which can be uncomfortable."
2,"Good hardware, terrible software and drivers","Be aware that this product will not work out-of-box with Vista, XP Media Center, or XP Tablet Edition. The hardware is great, but since the echo cancellation is done on the PC working drivers are essential."
4,It's cool,This book was bought solely for research that I am doing on Isaac Murphy. I am appreciative of all information I can garner on him. The book was in great shape. Looks new! Great job!
3,not bad,Buddy try not reviewing your own book. Can we say no credibility.I get your email although I dont even remember subscribing to it. The book is alright but you are not the next Rashi.
3,Stretching the Tao.,"It must be remembered that this book is written by 2 psychologists.Buddism and its philosophy, teaching and meditations are very conducive to a pshychological bent.But I felt they stretched the ideals of Buddism and innocence to better coincide with the Christian 12 steps. The idea to give yourself totally up to God, and relieve the mind and soul of guilt and shame is quite different than Buddism.Buddism allows choice and therefore, though born innocent, you are responsible for your karma.It is a useful book to change negative ways of thought.But be mindful of where similarities exist and where they are stretched."
5,what awonderful insight,"this was a very interesting book, especially if you are fighting to keep sobriety. The book almost takes you out of yourself and helps you gain more self control by understanding different ways of thinking...."
2,Not useful for real physics,"It is difficult to fathom how someone could write a 350+ page book on group theory for physicists in 1985, which contains almost nothing addressing the most important applications of group theory in the last half century. Hello, ever hear of the Standard Model? Grand Unification? It's like this book was written in the 1950s; it goes on and on about SO(3) and the lorentz group, etc. Special unitary groups are only mentioned in passing. Not even a hint of the exceptional groups. Georgi's book has what physicists actually need in a small fraction of the page count."
2,hohum,"This product was supposed to help with menopause. It also says it has both progesterone and estrogen. After 2 weeks, I am not getting any relief."
3,Sound quality lacking,"The songs are great, but there's just too much static. It seems like the tracks could have been cleaned up considerably. A lot of the Noel ones can be found (in better quality) onThe Masters' Voice: Noel Coward, His HMV Recordings 1928 to 1953 Volume OneandThe Masters' Voice: Noel Coward, His HMV Recordings 1928 to 1953 Volume Two.I am very greatful for the harder-to-find Gertrude Lawrence songs such as ""Do, Do, Do.""I would give this 5 stars if the sound quality was better."
3,Nathan Flurry,"I purchased this item to use while x-country skiing. The water bottle fit very tightly in the zippered pouch and was not easily accessed. Also, the lid on the bottle was very awkward to flip up and could not be done with x-c gloves on. I'm a skate skier and want something that is easy to use while moving. This is not it."
4,great for running,"I was training for a half marathon and wanted something to carry with me on training runs. Being out on a remote path for a couple hours by myself during ""long runs"" training for a half marathon, I wanted to have fluids, something to carry a cell phone, pepper spray, car keys, and a small pistol. This worked out perfect for a KelTec P3-AT, but was too small for a KelTec PF-9.Actually, it was so comfortable to wear, that I carried it with only gatoraide and cell phone during the half marathon I ran.Outside of wanting the strong arm pocket just a tiny bit larger, the only issue was that you need to use a couple of safety pins to keep the adjustable waistbelt from slipping once you find the right setting. While the bottle isn't easy to get in and out, it works and the insulation helps keep the cold where it is suppose to be.Good product, carries just enough for serious running."
5,Top Notch Pickin',"While solidly based on traditional ""Bakersfield Twang"", the blending of flavors from funk, rock, R & B, and jazz, gives the listener an interesting new twist on country music. From the mellow ""SMOOTH SAILING"" through the five-alarm, 6-string blaze of ""SECOND HAND SMOKE"", Forrest and the super guest pickers utilize chops from their respective ""bags-of-tricks"" to keep the listener tapping a toe while perched on the edge of their seat. It just doesn't get much better than this....top notch pickin'.When CMA is looking for albums worthy of being nominated for the award of ""Country Instrumental Album Of 2006"", we may very well see this disc in the heat of the chase."
5,Everyone in the world committed suicide at the same time,"Like the title of my review, the first sentence in this book had me gripped and it took me about a day in total to finish it. I had been wanting this book for quite some time and had a blast finally reading it!After everyone has offed themselves except from our main man he finds himself adrift in the middle of the ocean and comes across a bizarre building shaped like two women sitting back to back. We then find out what secrets this building actually holds.This like a couple of other Carlton books has also got a new cover being re-issued for it. So like my other reviews, once again you MUST check out the new rad artwork aswell as the awesomely cool original!A beautiful dreamy read!"
1,Just a mess,"I hate to be the first one to write a negative review of this one, but ... I didn't like it. It wasn't confusing -- it was just juvenile and unpolished.To me this story seemed like the author had a strange dream, woke up, and quickly scribbled everything down. Then he went and had it published without editing or anything.I wanted to like this story, but my mind was so not blown."
4,"A well written, biblical and intriguing look at who we are.","""Humanity & Sin"" deals well with the theological issues of anthropology and harmartiology while remaining very personal and interesting. If you have ever wondered about issues like cloning and Christianity, what it means to be made in the image of God (perhaps the most intriguing chapter of the book), or nature verses nurture from a biblical perspective, then you will find this book insightful and interesting. ""Humanity & Sin"" is for people who would like to sit down and talk with an evangelical theologian about real-life issues that you see in the news every day. Dr. Pyne has written a theological book that anyone will enjoy reading, and it is perhaps the best edition of the Swindol Leadership Library yet."
5,This is a DEFINTIE MUST READ!!!!!!,"This book is great!!! I got this book lastnight and finished it this morning. I could not put this book down!!! It tells a story of four friends Alexis,Sidney,Simone and Tracey and each storyline is unique and what book doesnt have drama and this book is no exception. This book was well written and I anxiously await more work from this author......Job Well Done...A definite must read!!"
5,A Page Turner,Definitely a page turner! The book contains many turns and twists that leads up to a shocking finale!
4,"With some friends, who need enimes","This novel made for a great read. All the characters were unique in their own way. If it wasn't for the death of one of the characters, I would have hoped for a sequel."
2,Be prepared!,"My family and I are planning a sailing trip for a few years and I wanted another perspective on family sailing. After reading this book I honestly did not know whether anyone had a good time on this 9 month adventure. The positive part of the trip was that the children came out of this adventure more experienced with life, etc. However it appeared the trip was a psychological challenge for all. I felt bad for the kids. I cringed everytime their love making came up and not because I am a prude - it was so non-errotic. The author should of left their sex lives out. Similar to having children, sailing for a length of time on a small vessel with four people does not necessarily bring people together unless the relationships are in tact prior. As part of my summer reads, this one was not pleasurable, but painful."
2,There are better cruising stories,"I read Herb Payson's ""Blown Away"" while sailing (I highly recommend his first book - skip his second) and craved another cruising story for my sailing trip this year. This book, while an OK summer read, fell flat. This book is more about a skittish marriage than what it's like to really sail for months at a time. In both arena's it's thin. But, as I said, an OK summer read and it does give you an overview of the challenges and joys of life on the water."
3,Captivating saga of a family sailing experience,"The book is interesting, and gives the reader an excellent notion of what it would be like to take a 34 foot sailboat trip with your husband and two young children. They sailed from Florida through the islands of the Carribbean, and back to Florida over a nine month period. It does seem, however, that the author feels overly compelled to inform the reader about personal problems and intimate sexual activities with her husband; most of these descriptions are far more personal than necessary."
3,MEN! Do yourself a favor and read this book.,"I found this book to be a great example of what ""not"" to do when desiring to form a bond of sailing friendship and fun with your spouse or significant other. This is not a ""look at the great time we had sailing"" book, but rather a true to life story of how the pressures of an already rocky marriage mixed with the stresses of becoming a cruising family influenced this family looking for relief. In some ways, I am not sure they found it."
5,I Stayed Up All Night to Read This Book!,"I don't usually read an entire book in one sitting, but I found I could not put this one down. Somehow, I felt compelled to make the entire journey--3,400 miles--at once. Susan Tyler Hitchcock has the voice of a poet. The lyrical beauty with which she describes her family's changing dynamic is delicious to savor. She develops her ""characters""--her husband, their new friends--believably and fully. And the detailed discussions of life on a sailboat--the 24-hour-a-day attention that it takes, the canned meals, the cabin fever, the storms--made me feel I was there with her. Hitchcock is a woman with a rich inner life. Almost anyone could write a memorable book about the Caribbean scenery. But Susan Tyler Hitchcock's voyage is an inner one, and far more challenging to depict. I am grateful to have been invited along."
1,Romance Novelist goes to sea?,"My wife & I are considering such a trip in a few years, and are reading as much as possible about others' experiences in the mean time. My advice is to skip this one (glad I only checked it out of the library...). What you get is the story of how a couple lacking in seamanship skills (yes, even her ""Capt. Bligh"" of a husband) and trapped in a dysfunctional marriage manage to survive 9 months in the Bahamas & Caribbean...with a graphic, poorly written ""romance-novel"" style sex scene every 25-30 pages or so. It all comes off as some sort of strange exhibitionism.I have sailed and otherwise travelled to many of the places she describes, and find her descriptions mostly on the level (although I hold Provo in higher regard than she does.) The rest of the book should serve as a cautionary tale on how NOT to do it."
4,Unexpectedly captivating!,"While planning for a sail away voyage myself, the last thing I wanted to read was another story about cruising. But a friend strongly suggested I read one more. And I am glad I did! Susan's story was interesting, compelling, and makes me want to leave on my trip even more. Good for sailors and non-sailors alike. I hope she finds her second boat and takes another trip!"
2,"Not a great sailing book more like ""self-help afloat.""",I really didn't like this book. This isn't so much a book about sailing as it is about marrige counsuling. I never could warm-up to the members of this cruising family and the author's non-stop soul searching was embarrassing. The descriptions of the couple's loving making positively made my skin crawl--yeech! On the whole if I had to go sailing with this family I'd stay home.t
2,"Great Voyage, poor telling","My wife & I have made this trip by sail and truly enjoyed reading about the familiar ports of call, however, despite our desire to share this type of story with others, I would not recommend this book to friends or family due to the pathetic marriage underlying the story, and the lack of focus. I wanted to puke when encountering the sex descriptions, given that the author is a door mat and the husband an self center jerk. There are better books out there on families at sea. Keep searching."
5,"PIONEER TS-A1671R 3-Way 6-1/2"" Speaker",Excellent replacement speakers for my van. They sound way better than the originals. A great value for the money.
2,too violent for ages 4-8,"This book is entirely too violent for ages 4-8. While the illustrations are good, the text has various references to torture and killing. It may be factually accurate as to the life of a pirate, but its too much reality for young children."
1,Skeptical,"I was surprised that the authors used such a significant amount of material from Atul Nerkar. He has been widely discredited given his unorthodox teachings at Columbia, and few if any of his peers have bought into his lines of reasoning. While some of the material in the book was thoughtfully presented, one must question the author's judgment in drawing upon sources such as Nerkar."
4,A Great Record of Lyrics and Good Musical Starting Point,"As a singer and keyboardist, I was very pleased to have found a copy of this book at any price. It suited my purposes perfectly, which is to have a record of the lyrics and basic chords. If you're looking for a tablature of the intricate musical contributions of Howe, Wakeman, and Squire, this isn't the book, and wasn't expecting it to be so. I can't speak for the guitar tabs, but the keyboard arrangements are ""Reader's Digest"" approximations of the originals; it leaves the soloing and embellishing to the reader. As one who is interested in being able to sing and play their classic epics, for example, to my knowledge there's no better starting point out there for sheer coverage of the classic era."
3,Yes- Complete Deluxe Edition,The Book was Nice BUT it did NOT have TAB for Guitar. (Which is what I thought it was): (Have not Opened it sence.I guess it was my fault.I should have read about the book more before ordering ( Plus I paid forover Night shipping)Scot
4,The Complete Idiots Guide to Chinese,The program is quite good with the Chinese words spoken first followed by the English words (although it makes more sense to me to have the English first). It is very business travel oriented which is good for those people in this category - however we were looking at a more conversational type of product. Overall though the CD format is good.
2,Not worthwhile,"The CD Guidebook doesn't seem to like Windows 7 or XP, a printed booklet would be far superior. The audio dialogue lessons are too removed from actual usable dialogue and go into far too much specific language to be useful for a simplistic course--I learned very little in a few weeks before a trip to Beijing, and I am fairly adept at learning languages. The lack of any picture and speech coordinating imagery is a big problem; you can't visualize words and associate them with situations with this course. I will be investing in the Rosetta Stone system. Although this isn't actually bad per se, it is outdated and it isn't worth the time invested in listening. Something that involves listening, watching, reading and pronouncing at the same time would be MUCH better."
1,REMIXES FROM HELL!,"i hate this so much i can take the cd and burn it! WHO IS THIS WORLD LISTEN TO OR DANCE TO THIS HORRIBLE MIXES? THESE ARE SHAMEFUL MIXES AND THEY SOUND MORE AND MORE LIKE SISTERS OF MERCY!! WHERE ARE AT THE END OF THE DAY, OBSESSION, IMAGINATION??????????????? UGHRHHHHHHHHHHHH DISGUSTING! WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!"
1,Xymox fans stay clear!!!!!!!!,"I did'nt even have to listen to this album to know that it sucks.Already totally hating synthpop to begin with all i had to do was look at who remixed what and was totally disgusted.Xymox has always been my security blanket against the synthpop invasion,but after hearing about and seeing this i was simply put for a lack of better words PISSED!!.If your a true Xymox fan than forget this album,but if you like techno then go ahead."
3,Front Mats,"These mats are heavy duty. Although they fit the front of the Camry, the driver side mat is about 1.5 inches narrower than the factory mat. Apparently they did this to clear the trunk and gas release levers, but instead of a cut out, the whole left side is 1.5 inches too narrow."
4,Great fit in my Son's 06 Sentra,Have no complaints about these. They arrived on time and in perfect condition. They are well made and fit the vehicle quite nicely.
5,rubberized floor mats,"great product, great price. If they last more then five years the price will be worth it. Had them for about three months now. No sign of wearing or tearing."
2,Crap,This movie sucks but I'll buy anything with Tom Green in it. Although I must admit it's a lot better then Bob the Butler or the Shred films he did. The story is actually ok and the main cast do quite well but it suffers from lack of budget and feels like they rushed it
2,Corel DRAW 10 doesn't an upgrade...it's a downgrade.,"Corel Corp strikes out with it's latest DRAW release (10.0). It's harder-to-use-than-v.9 features, limited global customization, and lack of support for Illustrator 8 docs, make this version a downgrade instead of an upgrade. I am a lifelong CorelDRAW supporter who couldn't wait to see v10, but I was quite disappointed by the bad decisions Corel made. Granted, this product still blows away any Adobe product, but if you have DRAW 9, do not bother with 10."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I tried to like this product but the shortcomings are just too severe. The text handling is a nightmare, the re-draw rate is agonizingly slow and it can't do anything that Adobe Illustrator can't. Furthermore, print service bureaus bristle at the prospect of dealing with DRAW files. CorelDRAW 10 is just not worth the learning curve--or the price. Get Adobe, it's what real designers use."
1,Sure-fit has very poor customer service,"I purchased a slipcover directly from Sure-fit. It did not fit and the color was not as appeared on the website. I returned the slipcover in the original packaging, folded exactly as is came, and never used. They refused to refund my money, told me that I had to pay shipping (for a third time) to have it returned to me, and when I received it back it was shipped in a garbage bag. The customer service representatives at the company were stubborn and obviously had no concerns about providing good service."
4,Super Cute Pink Tea Bag Holder,"I just received my tea bag holder and was very pleased. It looks exactly as pictured however, keep in mind that it is extremely small. There is just enough room in the holder for 1 tea bag. Unfortunately I only ordered one so, I need to order more. All in all, it looks very nice and seems quite sturdy. The only draw back is the tiny size!"
4,Dance with the Stars,"This book is an excellent guide to the Spiritual approach to life. It covers all the metaphysical venues but also imparts that deeper view that leads to a joyful, loving life. It is easy to read and appropriate for any level reader."
3,very basic electronics primer,"Calling this book ""Electronics Circuits for the Evil Genius"" is really an over statement. For today's electronic enthusiast it is VERY BASIC. In addition' the answers to the worksheet problems are nowhere to be found!"
1,No genius to be found here,"This whole series of books is so misleading!! There is nothing ""fringe science"" or remotely dangerous or interesting in most of these ""evil genius"" books. NOTHING EVIL and NOTHING CLOSE TO GENIUS. This book is so cluttered, disoragnized and juvenile that i felt like going to petting zoo and standing in the fence and talk to furry beasts instead of read book. There should have only ever been ONE book titled ""Evil Genius"" and that award goes to Robert Iannini. But, even then, I can't see Iannini coming up with that lame idea for a title. What dullard at the publishing house would try to pass off other books under the guise of Iannis hard work and true genius. Dave Cutcher is anything but genius - boring and confused is more like it. All you authors out there should be warned to stick to your guns and give your books their own titles and personalities - don't get bullied by the burocrats with the boring covers."
2,cord,I ordered a cable for a camera. It was not the correct one.. (NOT THEIR FAULT)I tried to contact the people to return it within their time period. I recieved no responce. Now I have a cord that does not fit and no money back. (THAT IS THEIR FAULT)
2,kodak av-8 av cable,"This product does NOT allow you to transfer video or pictures from the Kodak z1485S camera to a tv that has the yellow video input cable, as it said in the ad for this item on amazon. It probably works for other cameras, but the product is of no use to me. I haven't investigated returning it yet, because it was fairly cheap. In fact, the cable won't even fit well in the z1485S usb thing, and I had to shave away some of the rubber to make it fit. You win some you lose some!"
3,Kodak AV Cable,My TV has many more pixels than my camera can deliver so the photos and videos are a little bit grainy. Otherwise the cable works fine and the TV provides a great venue for viewing.
5,Getting rid of ham!,"I wanted to purchase this item to get rid of the ham in my pictures. I use a 7"" portable TV and this cable to connect to my Kodak 981 Easy Share Camera. That way the ham doesn't appear in people. They act naturally without knowing I've taken their picture. It's great for a serious photographer.Happy Snapper!Wise Guy"
1,Fuzzy,"I purchased this cable to use with my Kodak z915 camera, but when I use it to view pics on a TV the images are terribly fuzzy and pixelated. It's basically unusable. I don't know if it's a cheap knockoff cable or just a defective Kodak cable."
1,mary,this is the second time you have sent the wrong item. needed a/v adapter for kodack camera to t.v
5,Can't go wrong.,"This CD is worth every penny. If you are new to Zydeco, or have only heard that terrible canned tourista garbage that spills out of seedy t-shirt shops on Bourbon, Decatur, or Canal Streets, you should give this CD serious consideration. Chenier shows us what a tremendous artist he is by fusing Zydeco, R&B, and the blues! One track on this album has a little static, but the rest of them are crystal clear."
5,NOLA Lives,"Harry is -- as Harry always is -- Great. Makes me homesick for the Crescent City. Settle back with an Abita beer, a bowl of gumbo -- and Harry's NOLA. Life is good. randy"
5,The Best From Harry!,"How could you not adore this CD? Every single track just gets you movin', keeps you smilin'. ""All These People"" especially piqued my interest. Mr. Connick made a wonderful arrangement by adding Kim Burrell. Both lyrics and music in this track, I think, really capture the essence of what so many were going through.Can't say which is my fav so far; they're all so equally great. Love how Connick evokes so many different genres within these songs! Love him even more for throwing in a man's take on Bill Bailey.Truly a jambalaya bowl full of 'Nawlins, this CD can't be beat."
2,Not for me.,"This album is... okay. Everything about it for me is just ""alright."" There's nothing spectacular, although I suppose if you're a Harry Connick, Jr ""fan"" you might enjoy it. It seems too synthetically ""rich,"" like they were really trying for a certain sound, but it just never made it ""there."""
4,HARRY BRINGS BACK OLD FAVORITES WITH STYLE,"What can you say about Harry. Another great one to ad to my and your collection. Harry sings songs that you may remember as a child, (if you were born before MTV),with his own style and grace. And the Amazon price is also very nice."
5,Best CD Yet!,I have been a Harry music fan for a LONG time and this CD is his best yet. It is so obvious the music on this CD is coming from his heart. His passion shines through! The original songs are just as wonderful as the rest. What a talent. Can't wait to see him sing in Chicago.
5,Teach Me How to Dream,If i wish for you ? Would you make now my wish come true ? I wish no more War in the World.
3,Okay,This product is just okay. I think it needs more garlic. I love strong garlic taste and this one had a mild taste.
2,Let the legend Live!,"The argument goes on and on..But it is bewildering how some authors will find any means possible to support their hero worship sentiments. The question I ask is why are Mexican eyewitness accounts scrutinized and summarily dismissed if they counter legend? And why are some Mexican accounts acceptable when they support legend? Why does the author accept questionable Anglo accounts (Dickinson) yet fail to question her credibility in light of some confused observations (her sighting of Travis body on the chapel roof)?The author,I guess, believes students of the Alamo will believe what they want to believe...and accept the verification of that belief that best fits their views. In my opinion, those who want to maintain the The Legend Must Live! view of the siege and fall of the Alamo have an ally with this author."
2,I felt cheated,"I had never seen Three Kings before and it was a fair movie. I bought this primarily for The Perfect Storm. The movie was exciting, but just as the action was really getting going, the disc stopped working properly. It played really slowly and the picture became scrambled. I tried ejecting and reloading the disc and I tried a different DVD player in our house and the same problem occurred, so it was clearly a defect in the disc. I never got to see the end of the movie... a big disappointment!"
1,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"Ordered a NEW DVD, when it came it was not new (was not wrapped in plastic) and the case was broken.Contacted the seller, and was told to send it back to them, which I did.After about two week, I again contacted the seller and asked when I would get my NEW DVD?They tell me, ""any day, be patient"". That was over a week ago! I guess I've been taken advantageof and they are going to keep my money and laugh all the way to the bank. :-(Wish I could give them less than one star."
5,Great price for this collection.,I am so happy this collection was being offered. I love Peter Sellers and this box set has my favorite movies of him.
4,Good entertainment,"Peter Sellers' greatness as a comedic and dramatic actor is shown here, with the bumbling actor who destroys a film and then a party in The Party, the marvelous spoof of the Bond movies in Casino Royale, the various plays on words and throughout them all the slapstick, which not all actors can get away with it... This is a good collection of great movie actors, including Niven and O'Toole, and the marvelous US and European actresses that intersperse these films. Mostly fairly good comedy. Unfortunately some of the color in What's New Pussycat is off, and the sound is not always good. Some of these also seem to be missing lines. Are we editing movies for political correctness? The Pink Panther is a work of genius...Despite the flaws in the set, all in all, pretty good value for the money."
4,Great shape,This was exactly what I was expecting. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is because the corners of the box were dented a little bit which may or may not be the sellers fault. Otherwise the DVDs were in great condition.
3,Peter Sellers Collection,A bit dissapointing. Not as funny as I remembered or expected. I guess people change...
5,Essential steelband music,"The highlights on this album are the first & last tracks, being quintessentially Trinidadian steelpan playing, very muchin the mode of Ellie Manette - music I grew up with. Which is not intended to diminish the tracks in between - which are also a joy to listen to. Accomplished playing and brilliant recording - unlike my old Trinidad RCA Victor vinyls of the 50's.If you have any interest in pan music this is a must-have."
5,Muy Caliente,"This is magnificent work. Very hot, beautiful, luxurious, sensuous, extraordinary compositions and performances by a huge ensemble. Coffee Street is a classic. Narell builds brilliant solos with a latin jazz sensibility against a monster rhythm section. The best steel pan I've heard. (Check out, also, Narell's ""Fire in the Engine Room"" -- swinging stuff, but takes it down a notch, and is actually less fiery than ""Passages,"" while sustaining the beautiful rhythmic feeling; killer piano, guitar, drums behind the pan.)"
1,Opened? Really?,No where on the sale did this say that it was USED!! And going to be sent with masking tape wrapped around it holding it together! DISAPPOINTED!!!
2,corelle coordinates large counter mat,"this is a nice item for rolling out crust or cookie dough on as it is flat and easy to wipe clean...not too much sticks to it. It does get bent very easily, however...in shipping as well as in everyday use. Not as sturdy as I would have liked. I was under the impression that all Corelle was made in the USA, but that's not true and most of this stuff is made in China, which is a huge disappointment."
5,Great product though each is buried in a huge box and tons of curled brown paper,"I ordered 4 Corelle mats and 2 trays in the same pattern. The products are useful, pleasant to the eye and satisfactory, both as counter mats and pet food mats.Their though packaging is the most wasteful every, each comes individually in a 19&1/2inch by 9&1/2inch box tucked in yards and yards of curled brown paper. This is such a waste to to unroll the paper and reduce it to something that fits an recyclables trash can, and all this have filled it to the top!"
2,Disappointed,"Has some standout songs, but almost all the others are nothing to write home about. Was disappointed with the depth of this CD. The few standouts are nice, but the CD as a whole is lacking."
5,The best,"This is the only product I will use on my expensive work boots. Its easy to apply, gore-tex safe, contains no neatsfoot, mink oil, or petroleum products. I also recommend their cleaner and leather oil. Its great stuff that actually works."
4,Great conditioner.,"This is a great leather conditioner. Goes on well, lasts, and doesn't leave a greasy film. Unlike Mink oil, this stuff doesn't seem to go rancid or develop an unpleasant smell. I'm happily using Obenauf's on my boots, baseball glove, belts, bags, and even my leather jackets."
5,"spend the money now, thank me later","Incredible preservative for leather. I used this after using Saddle soap, and it has been great for rainy weather protection.Use 2 coats!Be prepared, this will change the color of the leather to a darker tone. Depending on the type of leather and condition of your current shoes, this could be a good or bad thing.On a pair of rust colored leather boots, they turned to a dark brown.On a pair of dark brown leather shoes, they turned more to a dark chocolate color.Personally i liked the new colors, but if you really like the original color, you might want to try something else."
5,Great Product!,Does exactly what it says it does. Application was easy and makes you feel like a man while doing it. The odor is strong and takes a few days to fade but it is not bad.
5,Good boot oil/protector,"This is decent leather and/or boot protection. It is natural and smells good. I don't have much to say yet about how good it preserves leather over the long run, but it seems to be working fine for the 8 months I've used it."
1,Doesn't Work and Plastic Cracked,"Only one seed germinated, and then it died. Eventually, the plastic cracked from being on the sill, and the water dripped out of it. The kids did not learn anything. Worst education toy ever."
1,I question the depth of her research,"Short stories extracted from other Treasure Tales Books.With over 100 Titles printed on the subject of the Lost Dutchman Mine, I'll never understand why she selected one of the Fictional Novels as her source of information. Her maps are nicely drawn, but offer little more information than you could find on a State road map."
5,Works well!,"I have been using Skype for almost a three years and have purchased a number of wireless and cordless phone options. By far, this has been the most useful especially at my desk. The sound it great and it works well connected to my PC."
2,Not Polycom's best product,"I am a big Polycom fan, but this is by far not their best product.I bought this for a small-sized conference room, and found thatboth the speaker gain and the microphone volume was far belowwhat was needed for any kind of reasonable performance. If thespeaker sat right in front of the unit, the performance was passable,but otherwise we often had to resort to just calling back on a landline (with our Polycom speaker phone).This might be fine for somebody sitting in their office, but thenwhy not just use a wireless headset?"
3,Microphone is bad,"I got 4 units for company use. Speaker is excellent. But one unit is deadly bad, very low mic gain. I returned it. Other three units are less satisfied. It's relatively low gain at mic. You can hear my voice, but like a fainted. I expected a loudness like an embedded microphone in Logitech Web Camera... It performs too far to it's glorious SoundStation. I'm considering to return all units..."
4,A lively and revealing history,"[Disclaimer: Co-author Stuart Timmons is a friend of mine.]I very much enjoyed the book. Certainly, those of us who lived through some of the events and who know or knew some of the people will enjoy the tale. And many folks, particularly newer generations, don't know much about this history at all. There's also plenty of new research, leading to rich detail that's never been told before.Tales of Hollywood celebrities are culturally important, but are only one part of the much larger story of gay L.A. told in this book. More interesting to me, for example, are the variant sexualities of Native Americans ruthlessly suppressed by missionaries, the prominence of nineteenth century transvetites, the lurching evolution of sexual law and politics, and much more."
1,"I [Cleo Manago] am misrepresented in this book, and have never met the authors.","Gay culture and books in too many cases are full of fiction, undocumented info. and just made up stuff. I have never met nor have ever heard of this book's authors Lillian Faderman and Stuart Timmons. If they decide to expand on this book, hopefully they will do the unusual in this gay-literature realm and actually talk to me. I am not a gay activist, as I am referenced (though I am a community activist) and their depiction of the Black community parade I was involved in is absolutely incorrect."
2,Childhood movie,"Would love to buy this movie I remember watching it on Disney when i was little, but it is way overpriced! this makes no sense...bring the price down and ill buy"
5,Fantastic Disney Original Movie,"I was up late last night and they played this on the Disney Channel at like 1:30 am. It was so good I couldn't get to sleep I had to keep watching it. I wish I would have taped it on Windows Media Center, because now I can't find any showings on TV. This is a sequel to the first movie ""Horse Sense"" which I can't find anywhere. I would love to see the first movie, and wish I would have before this movie. So I suggest that you watch Horse Sense first if you can find it, then this movie. It keeps you on the edge of suspense every scene. Very good movie with good twists and great ending. Price for the DVD is way overpriced though. They should have a DVD of the first and second movies on one, and charge like 14.99 like regular dvds are. But anyways, 5 stars."
3,Great light hearted family fun,"Although slightly implausible, ""Jumping Ship"" is a good all round family entertainer - ideal for those lazy summer afternoons, when you need something fun and light to entertain the kids. Certainly worth watching. There are no Oscar winning performances from the young cast, however, its pace is at a comfortable jog and worth sticking though all the clichés. The director left a couple of ""bloopers"" in the final version that are a nice touch."
4,Excellent,"Try getting this on the radio alongside Mariah Carry . ""My wife had dream/that I had a clone/and while I was away/the clone would keep her company.Thomas Truax goes on to explain his wife grew to love the clone more than him, and he bought the farm in a car accident, his wife uneffected. This all over ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" loops, but tons stranger than the Beatles song.That is what you get with Audio Addiction. Using advanced electronic loops, Truax creates music that is insane-not so in the sense we think of Primus of Butthole Suffers as a little off the wall--but truely bizare. I cannot think of much else like Thomas Truax, and I doubt anyone except Truax can think up music like this.If you had fever deams as a kid and want to hear them, and not someone trying to simulate them, this is for you. Music that is absolutely unmarketable, and we freaks should hear every note of it."
5,A Classic for Me !,"If your looking for a stunt video this is not it. There are a few wheelies in one section of the film but they're not spectacular like the wheelie pros are capable of by a long shot ( guys like LVX or the StarBoyz ) . It is a nicely shot well put together video of your more every day local sportbike riders have'in fun , a sportbike riders lifestyle film is how i'd describe it. Also it has realy great sound track of little known bands that compliment the action perfectly....I'm actualy as much or more of a fan of the sound track as i am the rest of the film.Please give this video a chance ....sit down and realy watch it ...watch it a couple of times ! ...Maybe it'll get under your skin like it did mine ."
1,"If you want action, don't buy this tape!!!","I went to the exitlight website and viewed the 2 trailers. WOW! Lots of wheelies and tricks. This made me want to see more, so I bought this video. Little did I know, the trailers I saw were for 'Las Vegas Extremes' NOT for 'Open Throttle'. Do not make this mistake. Skip this video. It is a wet noodle. Jump right to Las Vegas Extremes."
5,The health of a practice is gauged on the loyalty of its patients,"Although this book was written awhile ago, the patient perspectives it highlights are of even greater value in today's market place! Suzanne does a magnificent job detailing what exactly must take place in order to create an extremely loyal patient base that will go and tell their friends, keep coming back -- and accept treatment recommendations! Ignore these common sense, relationship based truths and a practice will never reach its potential -- and in today's economy, it may even fail. Dentists, who most frequently are magnificent clinicians and technicians, may squirm at her findings because they require a tremendous amount of emotional intelligence and communication skill building, but they are right on."
1,maybe for a Chihuahua,"My Lab destroyed the plastic parts in minutes and pieces showed up in his stool for days. If you want a rope, buy a rope. Do't buy this if your dog enjoys chewing."
3,Hmmm,"Well, I didn't notice when I bought this DVD that the program is less than 1/2 hour long. I was expecting something different, something more movie-ish. But for a 1/2 hour show, and since the money goes to Habitat for humanity, then I guess it was ok. It is really more of a promotion for the ride and interviews of a few people saying, we rode bikes across the country and it was hard but we had a good time. The riders did go through some beautiful places and I liked the shots of that."
5,Amazing,"I grew up with a cassette of this album. My mom always used to sing me ""I L.O.V.E. Y.O.U."" before I went to sleep when I was very young. Now I am almost 19, a freshman in college, and I still use that song and the others on this CD to help me fall asleep. They are the kinds of lullabies that will not annoy you if you listen to them all the time. I recommend this CD to anyone with small children or anyone who needs the comfort of a good lullaby. You will not be disappointed."
5,A LONG-time favorite,My mom received this cassette when my baby sister was born 17 years ago. During a long hospital stay it became our favorite. I bought the CD for my 3 sisters several years ago and now listen to it with my daughter. She loves for me to play it and she'll even fall asleep on the couch! I will continue to purchase it for all of my good friends as they start their families.
4,The Best!,My mom gave this CD to me before the birth of my first child. I listened to it in the car (stuck in traffic) when I was pregnant (so I could learn the words before the baby came). It ended up being a wonderful antidote to road rage. It's imposible to get stressed out while listening to these beautiful songs. Both of my boys have loved this music too.
5,For all day and all ages!,"These songs are too lovely to save only as night time lullabies.... and a great album for adults or children. Playing a Lullaby is the perfect soft song. Appalachian Lullaby is beautiful. Tomorrow We'll Go To the Fair just keeps playing in my head. Wings is a fantasy dream. I had the cassette years ago and now have decided to get the CD, which only happens with my favorite albums!"
5,Just what I needed,"This music is very beautiful. I bought it because I was having trouble falling asleep at night and thought something sweet and soft like this would be just the ticket. My grandfather used to hum the first song on this CD to me as a child and now he hums it to my cousin's child, his great grandson. It's really good, this music. The words are pretty, the tune soothing, and the fact that it has all the songs except ""dream theme"" with words and then just the musical score is perfect.I give this CD two big thumbs up!"
1,Terrible company to work with - awful customer service,"The cufflinks were delivered late, and the seller did not respond to four emails over five days when I realized that the delivery was delayed, including one email offering to buy another set if they would overnight them - I needed them my wedding. Terrible experience with the company overall. Cannot recommend ordering from this company.After finally contacting amazon, I heard back from the company, who blamed all of my problems on the US postal service (who I guess they also blame for delivering my EMAILS that they never responded to). By then it was too late, and I needed to go to the store to get cufflinks for my wedding.Cufflinks are as described."
5,It look like they said,"When I bought this dictionary, they said it was like new (not new), and is really good, clearly is not new but is in a good shape."
5,Very nice workout bench,Okay so I am a guy and Danskin is primariy for women. This is still a great high quality bench. It comes with four high strength rubber bands that attach to the bench. It has two hand grips and two ankle wraps that attach to the bands. It also comes with a dvd workout video. I am not that much for workout videos but I can tell you this bench will last a long time. It is very solid and the material is top notch. It has an well designed frame that you can collapse down very easily to fit underneath your bed. This is a great buy.
3,GARMIN RINO 520/530,"Very general coverage of the capabilities of this great gps.Not very good production, low budget. Better than the manual.Would have been a good buy for $12.99, but not worth what they arecharging."
4,Fascinating reading,"""I just finished reading every page of Warrior Priest. I even poured carefully through all the Epilogues and Acknowledgements. I particularly appreciated the Roster of Real-Life People as that answered a couple questions I had noted while reading. I give Warrior Priest an A+. There were so many threads seemingly going in so many directions, but later they were skillfully woven into one solid fabric that became a fine novel."" Jan Catherwood, Titusville, Florida"
5,Childhood Memories and White Owl Cigars,"Having just finished ""Warrior Priest"" I am still fresh with childhood memories. Having grown up in the area of Mike Johsnons' story I reviewed some memories. Also remember my Grandpa and his White Owl Cigars! My,how they did stink!! My Grandma made him smoke them on the front porch!My Dad landed on Utah Beach, and I recalled some of his war experiences, not all good except for having met my Mom in France!Mike Johnson has written an enjoyable page turner giving me a different view of life during WWII Europe and a better perspective of events with charcters to which one can relate.You can learn more about ""Warrior Priest"" and the characters at mikejohnsonbooks.com. It is an easy site to navigate."
4,Wonderfully written,"This book is about 5 generations of a Korean family and their struggles with invasion, war, poverty and trying to survive in different countries alien to their homeland. Although this book is full of historical information on the last 100 years of Korean history, it is never boring and hard to put down. The author paints a very vivid picture of her ancestors, their village, and their struggles through life and extreme oppression and abuse from the Japanese. It's difficult not to empathize with all the characters in this book and worth reading."
3,"Not bad, but incomplete","I like the concept of the handbook series, and this particular book certainly provides a lot of good information. However, I would have expected this book to give me a good overview over all threading aspects and provide at least a starting point for further investigation.While I recognize the fact that a book of this size can't cover everything, I was still disappointed about coverage of fairly basic subjects, such as making Windows Forms thread-safe. I am also disappointed in the coverage about the thread-pool for instance.Overall, a nice book, but there are a number of books that have a single chapter devoted to threading, yet cover more ground in that area..."
3,good: incomplete downloads,"the people who gave this book 3 starts are very closeThe books does demonstrate the basics very well,but when it comes to the interesting pieces thedownload examples were missing"
2,Sloppy examples,"I don't hate this book because it taught me some good stuff about Thread. BIG HOWEVER, the examples in this book are SLOPPY. Wrox gathered 7 people to write this thin book. No wonder they went bankrupt. And with 7 people, this is the kind of quality of sample they can come up with? Please... I will take a note of these people so that I won't ask these people to write code in the future. They obviously didn't even try to compile the code before putting it in the book!"
1,The worst computer book I've EVER read,"If you have ANY understanding of what threads are about, avoid this book!!While the topics are laid out in an intelligent manner, the code examples are just flat out wrong. For example, on page 61, there is a screen print of an app that prints prime numbers. The problem is, the app is printing out 25 & 49, not prime numbers the last time I checked! And sure enough, if you download their code, it prints out the same incorrect values.If you have NO understanding of threads, this book is probably OK, although the help that ships with Visual Studio is probably just as good. But for my money, any book that puts forth an app that incorrectly calculates prime numbers(!!) shows a sorry lack of attention to detail."
4,Double!,"Two enjoyable, funny, well-cast teenage girls play the parts of Heather and Heidi Burge. Many emotions are felt when watching this movie: Happiness, sadness, and even a little bit of anticipation! I never say this is one of my favorite Disney Channel Original Movies when asked, but then every time it's on I watch it. My only problems with the movie are these:Even though it can be entertaining, the ""Dad Who Doesn't Have A Clue"" plot is becoming over-used. There are only a few parts where it makes the story interesting.So, basically, I only have one minor problem with the movie. Otherwise, it's great! But I would wait for it to come on the Disney Channel before I would buy it."
5,great scope,I only needed another scope for my original I used for 12 years was stolen at work. Great price. the only scope you will need for a long long time.
5,Awesome!,Shipping was fast. Love the color. Can not wait to being using this product soon. I highly recommend a Littmann over any other product.
5,Great purchase,"When my old stethoscope broke I needed a new one immediately. Unfortunately the raspberry color wasnt available from the seller and they described the available color as ""peach."" When I received the stethoscope, the color was closer to pink. But besides the color, the item shipped quickly and I'm very happy with the product. Would definitely reccomend!"
4,Good for the price,"There is no problem with the stethoscope...I am very happy with it, the only thing i was little dissappointed was it took 10 days for the product to arrive....but for that the product is great."
3,Great Product but I had some order problems.,"The product itself is great easy to hear with, its not too heavy, but its got enough weight to feel solid. The problem I had was in receiving the wrong product. I ordered the Littmann Classic II Black Edition for 79 dollars and received a regular black Littmann. I wouldn't have complained if they weren't priced differently, I mean the way it looks negates the way it works, but the one I bought was 15 dollars more than the one I received. Overall the product is great, it feels great, it sounds great, and if you receive the one you order you will be more than happy with it. (I ended up getting my money back for it Amazon's customer service took care of me properly.)"
1,THIS IS NOT A LITTMAN,"Do not be fooled by either description, photo, or reviews. This is definitely NOT a Littman. We own a Littman and wanted to purchase a couple more to give as gifts to medical students. The product is completely different from the Littman, and is a very bad knock off. If you've never had the original, there would be no way of knowing. Especially because it carries the same model ""name"" as the Littman does. Notice that the seller conveniently leaves out the word Littman in his description, but allows unknowing reviewers to speak about the Littman.This is a big ripoff, and I don't understand how the reviews speak about the ""Littman"". Do not fall for this trick and do not buy this product if you are looking for a Littman.Unless the seller has changed its product in the last few months, I purchased two, and I am returning them, as they are not what they are supposed to be."
5,Littman Classic II S.E. Stethoscope,"Product arrived in original package, factory-sealed. An excellent value for the price; my fellow nursing students can't believe the deal I got! No one else has this color, either. I would certainly put these folks at the top of my list for future purchases."
3,It's not purple,"The scope is of great quality as all Littmann stethoscopes, it simply should not be described as purple since it is actually plain blue."
5,I love this thing,I'm a newcomer into the healthcare field but I love this thing. Even other people who've used it comment on the great sound quality. plus it's totally gorgeous :)
1,Disappointed with color,"The stethoscope that I ordered was supposed to be purple, and it looks more like a navy color. I looked into returning it for a different color but I couldn't. I wish I could have gotten the color I actually wanted since I paid so much!"
3,"Works great, color is wrong","Littmann's are the best. You can hear so good with them, the sounds are so much clearer. As for the color, it is skin/flesh not pink. Do not let anyone miss lead you. All the pictures are wrong. It looks just like the one customer image."
3,Expected more,"I have heard Littman was the top of the line, however when I received the product I was disappointed. It doesn't seem like the quality is $70+ worth. I feel like I could have saved $40-$50 with an off brand product and gotten the same quality. It seems to do the job, I was just expecting a more ""durable"" looking product. In time it may receive a better rating if it proves to be more durable than it looks."
5,Improved hearing,It has been a great improvement from what I was using before. I feel like I have superb hearing now.
5,Audio Perfecto!!,sin duda al primer uso se siente la diferencia e la calidad del sonido con respecto a los diferentes fonendoscopios que ya he probado!!
2,Not as pictured,"After paying the amount I did for this stethoscope, I expected it to be as pictured. The bell and diaphram are not rainbow finish, and the tube is not a bright color, its almost a hunter green! Not what I expected!"
5,Good and Reliable,"I purchased it through Amazon.com to gift it to my friend who is a Doctor. And as per him this brand is one of the world famous brands, it is reliable and he is happily using it since then."
2,Not the color as shown in the picture,"I gift this to my sister, the picture looks good but the product which we received doesn't match up to the color. Very disappointed on the gift itself. I have seen the same product in Black which is great and one of the best for School Use. I would recommend the product to someone but to buy the standard stethoscope colors(Black)."
2,I've had better,This item is not as good as other Littmanns stethoscope I've had you can hardly hear out of it and the pretty pink color turns a dirty look when the silver starts to wear through it. Gross! Well I bought it for the cause.
5,TOO ORANGE!!!!,Great brand but the color is not as advertised. If I lived in the USA I'd return it....too orange man!
5,Very helpful,"Im an EMT right now, this product is the best! I always use it! Im soon to be paramedic and i will be using this stethoscope! if you want to get into health care this product is the way to go! you hear lung sounds 100% and great for b.p. Im 100% satisfied! and plus the stethoscope looks sexy, all black!:)"
5,great choice,"I love this stethoscope(black on black), it looks amazing in person, so happy with my choice, I was wanting to get a colored one, but am so happy that went with this one. LOVE IT and love Littmann!"
4,It was good.,The steth looks just like on the picture.It looks pretty and no problem at all.It was a reasonably good buy.
3,Product review,"The color wasn't exactly like the picture. Its more matte, dull, and a bit darker. I was looking for a lighter shade of this color. My roommate and I bought the same stethoscope with the same color title, but from different sources and for some reason hers looks exactly like the picture and mine didnt. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars.Other than that it's great. Littmanns are the best. It comes with a second pair of ear pieces that are much better at tuning out extra noises and hearing what you intended to hear."
5,Great stethocope,"I absolutely love this new stethoscope. I've only used it a few times since I received it a couple hours ago, but the sound is much more clear and crisp than my old one, I had a Prestige Medical stethoscope before and this new Littmann Classic II is phenomenal! Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
5,great stethoscope,"great stethoscope, I got it in gray and like it a lot, the ear pieces feel nice and smooth, lays nicely over the neck and is surprisingly light, I forget I am wearing it; good price too."
3,Pic wasnt accurate,So far the product works well as can be expected with this brand but i was very disappointed that it didnt look like the picture that amazon has posted. The silver metal below the earpieces is actually a gold colour.
3,It's OK..,"Littmann Classic II SE stethoscope was received. Postage took longer than expected by a week, but that could be because I live in Darwin. The color is NOT AT ALL like the picture, tubing is very dark green and metal ear pieces are gold not silver. Makes the whole thing look very mismatched not at all pretty like it displays in the picture. Slightly disappointed as this is my very first stethoscope but I do not have 6 weeks plus to wait to get one that I am happy with. Maybe the description/photo should be amended?"
3,Stethoscope works great but the color is soooo not close to pink...,"The stethoscope is great, the only thing i was upset about was the color which was far from the color pink for breast cancer and the image. it's more of a peach color..."
4,Littmann II SE stethoscope,Good stethoscope for the money. Solid construction and the smaller bell is good for taking blood pressures on little arms. Comfortable ear pieces and good acoustics. Plus it is orange...nuf said.
2,CardiacNurseReview,"I bought this for the same reasons as many others: The cute pink color and for breast cancer awareness. I loved this stethescope at first! However, after about 6 months of usage I began to realize the pink tubing was becoming stained by pens, scrubs, etc. I have tried several things to clean the tubing and nothing has worked. My best friend has this same stethescope and has not had as many problems as I have. Being a cardiac nurse, I made the decision to trade up to a Master Cardiology because I find I hear heart and breath sounds a lot better with it. I really love both stethescopes and think this particular classic stethescope is great for students and most nurses."
5,Love it!,"This stethoscope works great- I'm really impressed by how clear I can hear a heart beat (among other things). Although I haven't owned any other stethoscopes to compare it to, I can really feel the quality in it. Also aesthetically- the ceil blue color is GORGEOUS. It's like Cinderella's dress blue, and feels feminine without being unprofessional."
4,Very Stylish,"This was a gift for my girlfriend, and she was very happy because this stethoscope is very stylish (Black Edition). The quality of sound is very similar to other brands of stethoscopes."
1,expected better,"I bought this stethoscope thinking I was investing in a better tool than I had before. My previous stethoscope lasted 20 yrs. and was not an expensive one. I was hoping this one would be even better. I used it two days and it broke. The company I bought it from pretty much had the attitude ""nanny nanny boo boo"". It had to go back to the company that made it because it was under warranty. I paid to send it back and have not heard a word back or received money back, or received a new stethoscope. ?????"
2,"3M Littmann 2218BE Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Black Edition, 28 inch",LITTMANN STETHOSCOPE VERY EXPENSIVE.PERFORMANCE IS THE SAME AS ONE I HAVE ONLY $25.I DONOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE.
3,Good piece for the price - students!,"Purchased this after a complete disappointment with the Lightweight version. I'm still pretty new, so I shouldn't comment on how well this sounds, but for the price and from what my instructors told me, it is a good deal all around. Guess that is good to start with then I'll move up to a Cardiology once I'm out of school."
5,stethoscope,I bought this item for my daughter who is an ER nurse for her first job. It is exactly what she wanted.
5,AMAZING!,"This is one of the best products out there for health professionals! Very comfortable ear piece. Overall, this is a great buy!"
5,Fantastic,"I've always loved the Littmann stethoscopes, and this one is no different. Although not one of the top of the line models, it works great for me as a 1st responder."
1,Wrong stet,I received the plastic one instead of what's in the picture which I purchased because of the price. I felt deceived
5,The Standard of stethoscopes for hospital medical personnel.,"I needed a reliable stethoscope for care of a stroke patient and my daughter, an ICU Nurse, highly recommended the 3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Black Tube, 28 inch, 2201. After some research I learned the technical reasons why this unit is considered as the ""standard"" by most medical personnel. Aside from the high quality of components, it faithfully transmits key sound waves to the ears from the patient. While I am not skilled at descerning the differences in verious organ sounds, taking blood pressure is so much easier than with the ""cheap"" units I previouly used. It's well worth the price of investment in a quality piece of equipment."
5,THE BEST SCOPES,"3M Littman Classic II S.E. Stethoscope - Gray - 3M Medical 2203I BOUGHT MY FIRST LITTMAN SCOPE OVER 35 YEARS AGO FOR NURSING SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH, I HAVE PURCHASED OTHER LITTMAN SCOPES OVER THE YEARS (CARDIOLOGY), THE ORIGINAL ONE IS STILL GOING STRONG (I DID HAVE THE TUBING REPLACED BY LITTMAN ONCE) THEIR SCOPES COST MORE BUT LAST VIRTUALLY UNTIL RETIREMENT! I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
3,Excelente,"simplesmente adorei o produto. Excelente qualidade, bom funcionamento e design, super recomendado! Esta totalmente de acordo com a propaganda. Chegou super rápido e lacrado"
4,Much Better,When I started nursing school I could only afford a very cheap stethoscope because I had so many other things to buy. I bought this one at a great price and I can hear out of it so much better than my other one. Now I do not even mind doing manual blood pressures because I can hear so good and I can hear heart and lung sounds much better too. I feel like I give my patients a much better assessment now that I can actually hear clearly and much louder.
2,Wow that's a horriable color,As with most Littmann stethoscopes the sound quality is alright but the color is nothing like the bright pretty pink one displayed in the first image on this page. It's not even close to pink - the only thing I can liken it to would be the mucous membrane color of an extremely anemic & slightly icteric patient. Good thing I only bought it as a spare.Seriously considered returning it on account of being ugly.
2,"Great Stethescope, but not like the picture...","I love the Littmann classic ii, but the picture on this item is NOTHING like i received. The metal on the stethoscope i received is gold (i knew it was supposed to be ""rainbow"" on the diaphragm but not by the ear pieces.) The other part was the color of tubing is WAY off, mine almost looks hunter green. Its not bright teal/ ""caribbean blue"". I am returning it and getting the black just to be safe."
5,Same quality and reliability,Stethoscope is great as was my old one which lasted 20 yrs til the tubing dry rotted. Nice color choice as well. Excellent timely service and well priced.
5,Excellent Stethoscope,"You can never go wrong with Littmann stethoscopes. Great build quality and it works very well. I've always used the Classic II and find it works quite well for general assessment. Hard to beat the quality and precision for the price. Overall, very happy with this 'scope."
3,"Not as pictured, otherwise OK, quick delivery,","The metal Cardilogy II is pictured in the Ad but I received the plastic ""Light"" version. The price was appropriate for the plastic one, but would have been a deal for the metal one."
2,Misleading,"As I chose to by this stethoscope, it stated that it came with a name tag to attach to stethoscope, a name badge holder and a stethoscope holder (for scrub pants) I never recieved anything other than the stethoscope, in which if it wasnt misleading with all that I would give it a higher rating etc.... I love my stethoscope."
4,its great,i am a medical graduate and this is very helpful in listening both the heart lungs and abdomen.. we can listen high frequency and low frequency sounds.. i am happy for the product.. it has great acoustics and ear buds are smooth and pain free.. i am only disappointed because there is no name tag.. i got an extra ear buds and warranty card
4,Littmann 2291 stetoscope,"My daughter is a nursing student. The stethoscope didn't work for very long. We contacted Amazon, and they replaced it ASAP. My daughter said it's common for stethoscopes to not always work right. Any ways, problem was fixed quick and easy, and my daughter loves it."
5,amazing for lung sounds,"I'm a Respiratory Therapy student and had to purchase a stethoscope for class, and this one works wonderfully for listening to lung sounds.5 stars!"
3,Gets job done,"Replacing the cardiology scope I had since starting med school. This one is significantly lighter and dinkier, but gets job done. Dark ink gets on the orange color and makes it look dingy."
1,3M Littman Classic II - NO Black Edition -,"I'm very angry . . . They did not send me the black edition. Of course the charge was for the black-edition $ 79, but send me one of $ 69 - 2201 model is not 2218BE!"
4,3M littmann 2209 stethoscope purple,"If you are loking for a classic stethoscope, it hasn't changed it 25 years. I am disappointed about the color. It says it's purple...it's more like dark blue. Kinda upset about that, otherwise works like my old one."
4,Can Hear,"I had a more expensive Littmann that was stolen so I bought a less expensive one to replace it.I hear heart sounds just as well with this Classic II as the much more expensive cardiology Littmann.Also, I do prefer the bell. It is also lighter around the neck and in the lab coat pocket."
1,"Incorrect Product Listing from ""Medical Department Store""","I ordered this product from ""Medical Department Store"". This item is listed as, and has the picture of, the ""Classic II"" stethoscope, but I received the ""Lightweight II"" stethoscope (the cheaper version). I contacted the company, and they initially apologized for the incorrect listing and told me they would send me the correct item at no additional charge. Instead of sending the correct product at the same price like was initially promised, they just refunded my money. When I contacted the seller again, they just asked if I wanted to order the more expensive one and basically acted like it was my problem, not theirs.I would not recommend ordering from this company (Medical Department Store)."
3,NOT purple,"It is a great item, its just not purple :( its the closest thing they have to purple though, unless you get a cardiac ""plum"" one. GREAT stethoscope, just wish it were really purple!"
4,listen to this...,"This is a very nice stethoscope. The ear pieces are comfortable. I use it primarily at home, to practice for my work."
1,Not received the product yet.,"The seller said the product had sent one month ago, but I havenot received the product yet."
5,stephoscope,I use this all the time in college for my nursing courses. it's just what I needed. thanks!
5,Great!,"This works very well (and I really like that I could get it in pink- my favorite color!). I've had a hard time with other stethoscopes, but this one is really nice."
4,gift for daughter,Daughter returned to school and is now in a nursing program while working full-time--I'm for anything that'll make her busy life a bit easier...the color also adds a little fun!
5,Best Stethoscope Ever,"I am very pleased with this purchase, use it every day at work would recommend it to everyone looking for one."
3,Definitely worth reading.,"The author was ill for years, and was finally diagnosed with lupus. A relative from Eastern Europe told her of the niacin cure, which was used there with success. She tried it and was cured by daily niacin injections. Yet I've never heard of this treatment for lupus since and wonder why not."
4,"Good preperation, but to example exam is too hard.","This book is a very good preperation for the test. All objectives of the exam are covered sufficently in this book. There is only one week point in this book. Some questions are harder and more tricky than the ones i encountered in the test (Nobody wants to cheat on you in the real test). I would advise to wait taking the example test until you really understood all the topics covered in the book. If you pass it the first time, the real test should be a piece of cake."
2,Don't buy the book,"The reason I got the book is that I can't find other books in Chapters, canada. I am an experienced programmer, and only want to use the book to review. I am extremely disappointed. First, the book is badly organized. You can find the most complex concepts and the easiest concept together, which made you confused. Second,obviously, the author is not a good writer. The concepts are not explained clearly. Maybe he is a good developer, but I find at least, it is hard for me to understand what he said. Third, the reviews answer is on the cdrom. I don't know why they do that. It isn't a clever way. My sugguestion is to buy other books. It seems the training guide is better. The reviews are good."
3,one word sums it up -- confusing,"The book is really confusing in the way it explains things. Sometimes even after reading the explaination to the answer to the practice questions, I would still be confused."
4,Well written; nice balance,"I found this certification guide enjoyable to read and a big help -especially in the section after each chapter that aids in reinforcing that paricular topic. I got a good a sense of where I stood in my knowledge of Java with each chapter and knew whether or not to move on or to throttle back and review along with other java books. I still refer to the other certification book by Roberts and Heller though, since they seem to be more convincing as to the particulars of the certification questions. I believe that as a teaching/guide book to prepare one for real- world java programming and evaluating ones level of expertise, this book does point the serious student in the right direction."
2,"Good IF experienced, don't touch if new to Java","Book has some errors, and if used ONLY for the test, you will fail. It glosses over a lot of topics and is good if you haven't touched Java in a while and need a refresher. I took the test after using this book and failed, looked up some questions I new I missed, and they weren't even in the book, no wonder I didn't pass. Got a more detailed book and passed easily. Barry Boone is good...just doesn't have a Java 2 book yet, but his ver. 1.1 book filled a LOT of gaps Brogden doesn't touch. Brogden says 'Native methods are not on the exam.' uh, yeah. Both times I took the exam, a question about Native methods was on the exam. Good for something...and that's a paperweight or a refresher."
2,Mediocre,"Like another reviewer, I also found the chapter on threading to be appallingly confusing. I continuously referred to Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java and the Java 2 Platform docs in an attempt to understand what Mr. Brogden was trying to say.Overall, most of the examples were weak and not conducive to learning or retaining the material. The chapter questions often highlighted subtle points more clearly than the main text. Such things should be explained well up front, not reserved for the quiz. More effort should be made to help the reader understand. A study guide such as this should include mnemonic devices too, clever ways of reinforcing esoteric ideas.I wish I had purchased the book by Mughal and Rasmussen instead."
2,pretty bad,"this book covers a lot of topics in java, but does so pretty briefly, and leaves out a lot of information. It leaves you having to write lots of small sample tests in order to figure things out. Its sample questions are decent, but the explanations describing which answers are correct absolutely suck.Here's an example from page 57:""Because answer a is correct, answer b is obviously incorrect.""Give me a break. It's as if having to explain why answer b was wrong wasn't worth the 30 seconds it would have taken him. He does this more than a few times throughout the book.Its coverage of packages and visibility is pretty bad, about 10 lines long.you get the idea. This is the first exam prep book I've looked at, so I can't say if any of the other books are any better."
5,A Must Book,"This is one of the must book to be read before the exam. Read it before 15days. That will keep your knowledge fresh. For passing the exam, practice is also necessary. You should read Complete java 2 cert. guide along with this book.So get ready for the exam and all the best!!"
2,Disapointing,"I bought this book along with the certification study guide, and was quite disapointed with it. The only benefit I got from this book that I didn't get from the study guide was the fact that this book offers a different angle on things, which can be helpful in understanding difficult points. In general, I thought the information in the book was good, but it was very pooly written. The code examples are particularly bad - they are a mess and ignore just about every recommendation in the Java CodeConventions ... I spend most of my time and effort diciphering the code, rather than understanding the point it was supposed to be illustrating.Overall, my recommendation is to just stick to the study guide, and if you need a second reference, look elsewhere."
2,Watered down java overview,"This book gets off to a good start in the first 6 chapters, but becomes weak quickly after that. Specifically chapters 9-13 are clear only if already known.Chapter 2 is very well written and gets 5 stars but by chapter 10 you can tell the author was all tuckered out.I feel that it would be very difficult to pass the Java 2 programmers exam after studying this book alone.My recommendation would be to buy this book if you had little java experience, and were using it as a stepping stone to a more rigorous book."
3,A handy notes not better than Roberts Heller,"I bought this book(the first book for Java2 platform exam) a week back. But, I got disappointed when I looked at the contents. This book is no more better than Roberts Heller. Because this doesn't explain concepts, but recollects what we've been studying with. It remembers what else to be practiced.But the plus point is that it gives good insight into inner classes.Coverage on Collections and IO were very poor. And I studied only four chapters, and last interest on this book.If you already have Simon Roberts, then this may just give an additional of 25% knowledge."
4,Excellent review of Java 2 Programmer Exam Questions,"This book delivers on exactly what it promises, a good review from multiple aspects of the kind of questions you will get on the exam. As the author recommends, do not buy this book to learn Java; those will some practical experience in Java will appreciate that the author doesn't waste time with 'HelloWorld' applets and other rookie nonsense. This book makes an excellent compliment to the big purple Java 2 Certification review (co-written by one of the exam authors). Reading both books with effectively prepare you for the exam. Good Luck."
2,not bad,"This book isn't a bad supplement but the Roberts/Heller/Ernest guide is the one to go with. The RHE guide gives complete and specific examples of every topic covered by the test whereas the Exam Prep frequently covers material not required for the exam (e.g. some of the layout managers) and omits important material as well. Most of this book is a rehash of the Exam Cram (which is very useful) and quite a few innacuracies exist e.g. the statement that the exam is 90 minutes long when, in fact, it is 2 hours. A little surprising that the author didn't know this. When I emailed the publishers on this (twice) I was told to contact my local testing center. Most helpful."
4,This books seems to be a very good one for programmers.,It will be excellent for me to see the book on line
1,Sun Certified Java Programmer,"""Don't buy this book, it is a trash and expensive""- thebook is poorly written. - the concepts are not well explained - youdon't learn the tricks that you need to know before going to the exam."
2,Okay,"This book has quite a few factual errors in it. If this had been my first Java book, I'd have been in trouble. However, the first book I read gave me enough information to recognize the errors in this one. This book certainly does a good job in certain areas, but not enough to compensate for its shortcomings."
1,Very confusding book,"This one is vey confusing and all messed up. most of the questions are not formatted properly as if written to bother you, not to help. not at all good for the certification exam. R&H is good despite its typos and all, atleast explains concepts clearly."
2,buy another book,this book is very watered down. i bought it first and ended up having to buy A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification and think it's much better. the only redeeming quality of Exam Prep is the sample test and questions
5,Focussed book,This is an excellent book. The authors' focus on the exam is very clear. Before one reads this book one has to learn java using a more conventional learning guide. 'Thinking in Java' available free online (at Bruceeckel.com) and Suns' online tutorial are good for that. The practice questions and mock exam are excellent. The content picks out and highlights key concepts likely to figure in the exam. It definitely helps that there are almost no typos. Content is based on the exam objectives provided by Sun. In all this book is bang for the buck.
3,Only half good,"I just passed the Sun Certified Programmer for the Java(TM) Platform this morning after having read this book. This book was very good through chapter 6. The rest of the book gave me the impression that it was written by a Java1.0 programmer, or that the information was cut and pasted from a Java1.0 or Java1.1 exam preparation text. As a particular example, the discussion of the processEvent method of the Component class left me wondering. It's not something you usually have to deal with (use of the XXXXListener methods is preferable) except when doing custom event handling. So, I have to wonder when the event handling discussion begins with that particular topic. I do think that it was worth the $23 I paid for it because the language basics are covered very well. A main reason for my purchase was its brevity. It would not suprise me if there were better exam preparation guides available. Better coverage of the java.io package, threads and events is certainly possible."
4,Useful for practicing tough questions,"The questions/examples are excellent and very tough. I bet U, if U can pass the exam paper given at the end of the book (of course on 1st attempt), U will definetly clear Actual exam. But, this book contains no other detailed useful information. As the author says, this book can be used only as supplement to some other book. Most of the questions in the book are also available in author's web site so it's your choice"
4,Does Just What It Intends To,"I am attempting to convert my career over to computerprogramming and have taken to the Java langauge in particular. I hadstudied for the Java 2 Programmer exam for at least 3 months (using Bruce Eckel's outstanding ""Thinking in Java"") when about 4 weeks ago I picked up this Exam Cram book. It was one of the best preparation tools I have ever found for a topic. Succinct, yet somehow well-detailed, it focused on just the topics covered by the exam. The mock exam in the back was a great aid, and the author's online applet mock exam was another fine tool. I passed on my first attempt, and I can truly say that the exam is difficult enough (due mainly to the directed questions, as opposed to broad theories and design issues) that I would not have without this book. Best ( ) I ever spent. END"
5,It's so hard to find a good children's book like this,"I appreciate a change from the usual cast of children's books characters (cat, dog, cow, horse): this book features otters, bats, foxes, anemones, eagles, and so on. The poems are great: the author rounds out the lines without useless filler words such as ""very,"" ""really,"" and ""quite."" Soothing verses and gentle pictures make this an excellent children's book. If you're from the Pacific Northwest, you must add this to your collection; if you're from anywhere else, you'll want to."
1,Not pleased,"Several of the keys were loose and some of the corks were missing, causing it to play in the wrong octave. not pleased."
5,This is the last scope you'll ever need.!!!,"The Power Class delivers crisp, bright, highly resolved images at any distance, maintaining image quality regardless of recoil, weather or shooting conditions.Their European style 30mm tubes offer added strength and rigidity, while providing up to 40 MOA adjustments for windage and elevation in either direction.And, with their extra large objective lens, the Power Class scopes present the widest field of view and let in the most light, a perfect combination for hunting in low light conditions.This is the last scope you'll ever need.!!!Knobs can be blocked, and are VERY easy to adjust.The illuminated reticle works in every condition, in any contrast.In all its power - 32x - Its very clear, no color aberrations.You can shoot at very low light conditions."
3,Good But Not Great,"Rose does a good job of providing a one volume biography of Churchill. However, it was obvious to me that he was neither as familiar with Churchill as Martin Gilbert nor as talented a writer as Manchester. His strength is in his objectivity which yields a fair view of the giant."
3,The material is thin,The material is not the best according to the price. there is 2 pieces. the small one is really small. Not usable. otherewise every thing was fine. delivery was not fast mayby because of holiday time (christmass).
2,Poor writing - anyone with the info. could do it.,"So unfortuante that this is poorly written, Pet Sounds may very well be the greatest album of all time. Even agreeing with the premise though doesn't stop me regretting paying for this. I love the album but haven't bothered finishing the book, finding myself too disappointed - after reading most of it - to go on."
3,Nothing new here,"While it's always a pleasure to read anything by someone who loves Brian Wilson, there's nothing here that we didn't already know that hasn't been said by better writers. Very pedestrian writing and padded out with lots of material that are easily found elsewhere - do we really need a listing of all tracks on the Pet Sounds Sessions box set? The whole book is badly in need of a good editor...doesn't do the wonder of Pet Sounds justice..."
2,Beach Boys Pet Sounds,Pet Sounds is a good read for people just discovering the Beach Boys. It talks about the albums' making and how it was marketed. The influence of how Pet Sounds was created and the influences it had on music. There is also an interview with Brian Wilson that talks about his 2002 tour and interviews his band members that give an insight to the man.
1,Really Pissed off Product Sucks,These mats suck was completely miss led with the custom fit. If they were custom fit mats why did i have to cut them down to fit in my vehicle. Do not make the same mistake i did. Double check the description of the product. Not worth the extra time or money to send back..
3,Reissue,"Spencer Wyatt's burning need in life is to fulfill her father's dream of finding the Hapzberg cross before he dies, thus redeeming him from being labeled a fool. As she sells off her family treasures, Spencer attracts the attention of Drew Haviland, the man she once loved and rejected. Neither has been able to forget the other, and Drew can help Spencer's dream come to pass, but will he? Will she let him share in the achievement? He believes terrible things about her, but nonetheless, can not allow the woman who captivates him to go off on an Indiana Jones adventure alone. So, though it's dangerous on multiple levels, Drew and Spencer team up to find the greatest treasure of all.Adventure and romance combine into a thrilling story that will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers. Ms. Hooper tells just enough, never getting too graphic, so even the most gently minded readers can enjoy this tale. At times, the angst gets heavy, but that's a minor quibble.Amanda Killgore"
4,Fast-paced Memoir about Compulsivity and Self Discovery,"Leith's book is a powerful read for anyone who has grappled with compulsive behavior. His memoir reads like a stream-of-conscious odyssey of a bright guy struggling to master his relationship to external desires for food, alcohol, drugs, and women. In the end, he discovers that his goal of mastery may have been misguided, and that his compulsivity may be more about his need for emotional calm than external pleasure. Leith's book is funny, intelligent, and, in the end, optimistic. While the book tends to get bogged down when the author spends too much time explaining the ins and outs of the Atkins diet and the theory that supports it, it is a generally fast moving read that engages the reader."
2,"Honest, but tedious and mundane throughout","I tried to like William Leith's book but I found his writing tiresome and surprisingly unperceptive. The author has little insight into why he eats all the time, he just talks about how much of it he does, and though I could relate to his food addiction, I could not relate to his outlandish social commentary. What was his point in writing this memoir? I came away from the book with no definite answer to this question. I admire his courage in writing this book, but I don't think his writing style is engaging or enlightened."
2,Ho Hum,"I can tell that this book was written by someone accustomed to writing shorter pieces. Although the topic was interesting, the book rambled and lurched along in a largely unrecognizable structure. Many of the author's (interesting, even) ideas were obscured due to the lack of cohesiveness of the book as a whole. Too bad a good editor didn't get on this one and whip it into better shape, because the topic as a whole is rife with possibility, and the author has an interesting and likeable voice."
3,About More than Food,"This isn't a book about food, this is a book about addiction.The author's addicted to coke, food, alcohol, etc., at various times. And he's impressively compulsive about it, cramming in food as fast as possible.Like many people these days, I'm watching my weight (and its tendency to creep up!). And I was interested in someone else's story about dealing with food and weight issues. But I couldn't really identify with this saga. It was just so far over the top from what I feel. I'm actually amazed that, given the was he inhales his food, that he wasn't a lot heavier.So, if you are interested in a tale of addiction, and a bit of redemption, you might enjoy this. If you are interested in a book on food & weight, it's really not so much that.Although he does appear to be on the right track at the end of the book, whether you can put that down to the Atkins diet he was doing, or the therapy he was getting, is an open question."
3,As hard to put down as a handful of peanuts...,"... and like peanuts, a moderate amount of this book is good, but you'll consume more than you need. Leith's writing is addictive -- stream of consciousness about his inability to stop consuming food, drugs,alcohol, sex -- and I found myself unable to turn away from observing his uncensored mind at work -- saying to myself 'just one more of his 3-page chapters'. I finished, even though I found nothing particularly original or profound in his repetitive chatter about how consumed we are with consuming and how empty the resulting guilt makes us feel and how looking within ourselves for greater contentment and rewards is a better solution. So be forewarned, once you're into this for a few pages, you'll be hooked, but you may feel a bit guilty afterward ."
5,Taking Life Head On is a 'life-changing' book,"Hal Elrod has the special ability to master the meanings that he puts to the events of his life. Taking LIFE Head On shows us how it's possible to turn what seams to be a tragedy, into a gift."
5,One of my favorites,"This movie has been one of my favorites since I first saw it when Disney channel was giving a ""free"" preview when you used to have to order it like HBO. I was about 10 then, and I still ADORE the movie. I ordered it when something made me search it on Amazon, and I have watched it with my nieces and nehpews, and sometimes by myself! Its the best blend of bright colors, catchy tunes, and some adult humor speckled here and there..way before shrek came along. If you are thinking about ordering it, do! And I suggest the Faery Tale Theater box set also!"
3,not bad,For the price I got it for it's a decent video card.I can play City of Heroes just fine. Won't support City of villains.So be warned.
3,"useful, but not great","This pad certainly made it easier to enter numbers into spreadsheets on my laptop, but it's not as nice as a typical keyboard number pad. The drawback is that the keys are just too close together. It's too easy to punch an extra number."
2,"useful, but not for long.","When I opened the shipping box, the first thing I saw was a really dusty, scratched up container with the retractable number pad in it. Very poor presentation for a buying customer to see. I used it once, and everything was fine. plugged it in a couple hours later to finish homework, and the middle row of buttons were not working."
1,Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1,Hi-def with 1.33 aspect ratio???? Is this really in hi-def or just a DVD in Blu-Ray? It's just not right.
1,not a typical star trek book,"This book was fantasy, not science fiction. I loved book 1, but unless you like pure way out there fantasy, I would skip book 2."
4,Great dinosaur!,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs at the moment. I know some parents wrote about having some issues with the eyelids and teeth?? Anyway, no problems here. This T-Rex is adorable and plush through and through. He's actually very real looking for a stuffed doll. I would definitely recommend it for toddlers."
3,"Define ""Introduction""","If you're into reading about physics but don't have the maths to back it up, this isn't the book for you. This ""introduction"" is probably aimed at university physics students. I am without a university physics education and am finding the book almost as hard as reading a Japanese newspaper. As with reading a Japanese newspaper, the pictures help a lot. I don't feel I'm getting enough to ""rate"" the book, but I can warn others as innumerate as myself.Update: I've made it ~halfway through. There's a great deal of uncertainty as to what I'm actually understanding as opposed to what I'm just filling-in with intuitive fictions. But I can live with that (as we all must at some point)."
4,3X3 Eyes,This dvd is excellent. The only reson I only gave it four stars is because it leaves off just when the plot starts to fall into place.
3,Boring for quite a while.,"Those who have seen this, you can probably agree. The characters in this film are weak. They are bland and lack any real interesting motives. Seriously. Everyone just shows up and bands together to open some demon portal which then leads them to caves and crap.The animation is fine. The japanese version is okay to my recollection. The English Dub is horrible though. I have never heard such terrible voice acting. Who did the laughs for these characters?The dubbing obviously doesn't do the series justice. I also think it is relatively boring throughout most. Once it gets near the end things start to pick up. Watch the Japanese version though. Unless you wanna hear that laugh 50 billion times. You know.... HAAAA hahahaa. HAAAA hahahahaha. HAAAA hahahahha. That one, the annoying one."
1,the cover is a lie,"when i first bought this anime i thought i was buying something with good-looking anime (like on the cover) with a fun plot.boy was i wrong!the picture on the cover is so incredibly different than the drawings in the movie.pass this one up!the plot is fine actually, a boy trying to save a girl from a life she doesn't want by helping her find this magical statue.sounds cool right?wrong.not only did they somehow manage to ruin this cool sounding plot but you are totally disgusted by the characters and how they're drawn.please believe me when i say you do not want this dvd.(i only gave this dvd a star because you just can't give a movie with ten drawings a second no stars.that would be totally cruel.even if it did turn out to be a bad movie.)"
4,cheat on her for catch the bad man!,"the girl did not know happen with the bad man have strong inside to beat on her and she get not remember the past with the guard guy but she love to him for good .. she did tell to him for real human with her life ...i did watch that before , what they talked about it.. because she have hard to save to her guard guy.. but he have strong ""WA"" on his forehead!"
2,KABBALAH,THE SHIPPING WAS MORE THAN THE BRACELET. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS CHEAP AND IT BROKE. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE.
1,lots of buzz,"the features on this phone are great - I really wanted to keep it, but the buzz in the handsets was driving me nuts. I had two handsets and both were bad. This seems to be a common complaint. I just took the phone back and am trying the siemens gigaset - so far so good with the new phone - though I miss the speaker phone in each handset."
2,"nice features, bad sound quality",I bought this phone for a high price and the sound quality is very poor. I returned the first one I bought because of the hissing sound and it was already used (it had local phone numbers programmed in). The second one I got has the same hissing and static sound. It is very noticeable. Also using the microwave interferes with the reception.
2,What a waste,"I too had very high expectations for this phone. I had one simple purchasing rule, if it doesn't sound better than my trusty old [price] (2 years ago) AT&T 900 Mhz phone, it isn't worth it. I figured since I was so satisfied with my old AT&T 900 Mhz phone, this new AT&T 2.4 would blow me away. It blew me away alright, with how downright lousy the sound quality was. In a nutshell, there is a very noticable hiss in the background. I also heard echos of my own voice while talking. I can't comment on range due to my dwelling being single floor. I really hated to return it because I thought the features were fantastic. It had every bell and whistle a gadget freak could hope for. Unfortunately, the ""gee-whiz"" factor tends to wear off rather quickly and you're left with a poor sounding phone. I've noticed a trend in the phone reviews and my personal buying experience. Is it me or does it seem there are no good quality phones anymore?"
3,Great Features-Poor Sound,"I have a love/hate relationship with the phone. It has all the features I wanted - caller ID, 2.4 Digital spectrum, speakerphone on the base, headset capable handsets, multiple handsets from one base etc. It is also the most professional looking phone I have seen. However, as many people have wrote, the sound quality is poor. Not as bad as some people have written but does have a hiss. Good news is that the hiss is hardly noticeable during a conversation. Range has been fine. If you can wait for a later version, do it. If not, it's not a bad buy."
1,"Big, Big disappointment","This phone does not deliver on the most basic, and most important, feature of a cordless phone. SIGNAL QUALITY. Signal quality is extremely poor on the handset. There is a constant background noise that is truly annoying during a conversation. It sounds like a 'Shhhhhh' noise that could vary in intensity from time to time but is always present. The rest of the features are great and the handset speakerphone works well. Saddly I have to take it back for a refund. I can't accept sound quality that is inferior to my 10 year old 49MHz, analog Panasonic phone."
2,Isn't this just a repackaged V-Tech?,"This phone looks suspiciously like the V-tech phone of the same kind. In fact, the reviews look about the same as well."
2,Boo Hiss,"Features are great, the hiss is intolerable. Returning it today. What was AT&T thinking to release this to the public?"
1,As Bad As V-Tech 2431,"As far as I can tell, this is the same phone as the V-Tech 2431. I owned (for a short time) both phones and did not see a difference either functionally or cosmetically. I found the ATT to function similarly to the V-Tech -- very poorly.The functionality of this phone is fantastic, with interesting features that I'd never even thought of, like the speaker on the handset. However, it has incredibly poor reception. On a conversation with the base and handset in the same room (less than 15 feet apart), I suddenly experienced terrible static. I had the same experience with a separate handset that I purchased. I also had the same experience with the V-Tech phone (at a different location within my home). I did not have this problem with 2.4GHz phones that I sampled from Uniden and IBM.Though the features are amazing, this phone simply didn't work for me."
1,OK if you don't mind a constant buzzing sound,"I just don't get it. It is clear from these reviews, and the fact that EVERY unit for sale at the local frys had a ""returned sticker"" on them that there is a flaw in these units that makes them just about worthless as a high end unit. A loud buzzing maybe OK in a $19 bottom of line generic phone, but a unit selling for $159??? Why would AT&T put their name on it??? Everyone's going to take them back and feel less confident about the AT&T brand name. I'm just upset that I wasted my time.However, if you just use the speakerphone in the base unit and toss the cordless handset, you might be happy with this phone."
3,My 2 cents,"It does have some background hissing sound. Cannot agree with people saying it is worse than 10 year old models, does not look that way. I did not have enough time to test it yet, but noticed, that, somehow, default setting for 'volume' on ANY of 4 handsets I ordered was 'Low', actually, the lowest possible. Increasing the volume to the MAX increased sound quality considerably. Try this - it makes sound much better. Hissing sound is still there, but reduced a lot."
2,This Is NOT Your Father's Coleman,"I looked at this cooler in person at a local retailer and found it to be sturdy, well constructed, and tight fitting. I ordered the item from Amazon and received a cooler that was MUCH differently constructed. The hinges on this unit are thin and one hinge was already pulling away from the plastic rivet. I went back to the retailer and purchased this cooler and brought it home so I could compare them side by side. Seriously it appears they were made and designed by two different manufacturers. If you want this cooler buy it locally as the models may appear to be identical but Coleman has two levels of quality. The one at Amazon is the poorly made one.This is a link to the better model and it is less expensive: [...]"
5,Nice 1 or 2 Person Ice Chest,I really like the look and feel of this ice chest. It will fit a 2 liter bottle of soda or a siz pack plus a couple of sandwich bags with ice in the chest. Perfect for a day trip or for the front seat of the car if you're traveling alone. Recomend it.
4,Nice cooler,"Just got it and hope it works as good as it looks. Others are right, the hinges look pretty flimsy. Looks like they could break without some care being taken when the lid is opened. Good size for fishin and taking in the boat."
2,"lid, hinges, handle on this cooler destroy colemans good reputation","The hinges on this cooler are terrible, they are made of plastic and will either fall out or just break in half leaving you with a hinge-less cooler. Also the handle is hollow plastic, mine snapped in half shortly after usage with minimal weight in the cooler. For a easy fix I inserted a dowel rod the size of the hole and gorilla glued it, now its far superior to factory... how it should have been made in the first place.all in all, look elsewhere for a cooler, this is not worth $18 + free shipping I paid."
5,very informative,This book includes many brief letters and stories from people who have lost loved ones as well as the authors own experiences which are quite fascinating and out of this world.It has been a great asset in my soul searching.
5,great book,"A very important book and can truly transform your life, If your interested in astral projection you get lots of answers here, a simple but stunning book"
4,Lookout guy?,"You are DEAD WRONG!:1. The Minute 2 Minute: This plan charges 25 cents for the first 10 minutes and 10 cents after. What you don't know is that there is actually a $1.50 access fee for the first 10 minutes. $1.50 a day for 30 days comes out to be $45 alone for 10 minutes each day.Basically you will have to spend $2.50 first to get 10 cents per minute. Assume that you just use 10 minutes everyday for 30 days. That comes out to $75 for just 300 minutes. Out of that $75 is $45 in hidden access fees.There are NO access fees for using VM minute 2 minute. Also it is free to check your balance up to 2x a day and each time after that is only 2 cents. Get your facts straight. I have had VM for 2 years and they are hands down the best prepaid mobil phone company, especially if you don't talk a lot and don't need a lot of frills."
1,Kyocera Still Cant Make Good Phones!,"This phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap. Its useless, the software on it is very cheap and childish. Not professional at all, the camera is pitiful, and the keys are too small for anyone who doesn't have 10yr old hands. Just because it has a qwerty keyboard; that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash. Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it."
1,Awful,I still cant believe i got this phone. when i first went through Virgin Mobile i thought it was a good service but it not. I first bought the slider sonic it was ok for about 3 month's then it freezes up i had to replace it 3 time what the heck that phone really stunk and the hole problem was the transflash memory card it had a virus in the card ??? i know ??? also i bought the kyocera Switch_back phone and the first one turn on and off and the second one i got did the same thing ?? LOL i must be a dumby to get a kyocera phone right. but just to let u know i tuke everyone back to the store to replace them and the store wasnt happy ever time they saw me lol i talk to virgin mobile about the prob. right the gave me ringtones and games 4 the prob. still doesnt cover the prob. how can i use anything if the phone keeps on freezing ???? SO DONT GET THE SWITCH_BACK IT WILL FREEZE
1,What a disappointment,I got this phone for my daughter's birthday as an upgrade from her previous phone. It worked great...for 3 weeks. Then it died and I've had a terrible time with customer service. I will have to find time in my overbooked schedule to drive 2 hours just to get my money back...and in the meanwhile my teenager is without a phone. I've used Virgin Mobile for 4 years and until now have been completely satisfied. Now I have to buy her another phone that she won't like as well...and hopefully the next phone I get WILL WORK longer than 3 WEEKS!
4,Good book for restoring old radios.,"Very thorough. This is a good book if you want to restore old radios. Gives a good explanation of history, and how the tubes and circuits work. There is a good section on troublshooting and repair. The only complaint is that the author goes into great detail to explain how the circuits are effected using equations in calculus ect. It is just a bit much for the novice to grasp. Otherwise a good book on old radios."
1,not satisfied,"from the description and title of this book, i was expecting a more step by step procedure of how to go about restoring/refinishing a radio i had purchased. This book is all about the inner workings of the radio components and is not the easiest to follow for someone who does not have any technology training on radio's.I would not recommend purchasing this book unless you are an avid radio repairman."
3,"Middle-of-the-road, but not hugely helpful","This book has positives and negatives.Positives: contains the first coherent explanation of how a basic vacuum tube works, and WHY. Includes theory and some fundamentals.Negatives: assumes the reader knows a fair bit about electronic theory. Equations need a more explicit definition of the variables contained within. And on a strictly mechanical point, there were some formatting errors within the book--references to ""Figure X-Y"" were on one page, and Figure X-Y was on the next or previous.All in all, I'm still looking for a good How-To book. I haven't gotten too far in the troubleshooting section yet to weigh in. On-line assistance through various web forums has thus far proven to be more useful for specific questions."
4,Very detailed and enjoyable guide to restoring radios,"I always enjoy technical books written by Joe Carr - he takes a subject that could otherwise be dry and boring, and turns it into something that is very understandable, and sometimes funny! This book progresses from the requisite origins of radio, into vacuum tube theory, through receiver basics, and dives into step-by-step guides to fixing an ailing radio. It is not a guide to the value or history of any particular brand or model of radio (it actually features very few photographs) but it *is* rich with schematics, diagrams, and guides to parts and equipment you will use when repairing antique radios. A great addition to your library!"
3,Misleading Cover,"The back cover of this book states, ""A Complete training guide to restoring vacuum-tube and transistor radios."" And an excerpt of the description notes, ""In addition to covering the vacuum tube circuits of radios made before 1950, author Joseph J. Carr gives you transistor theory and practice..."" Unfortunately, not a single mention is made of transistors or transistor theory in the book. Other than that omission, the book is a good guide to the theory of tube radio circuits and contains some chapters on tube circuit troubleshooting, safety, and test equipment. Some electronic knowledge is helpful in understanding this fairly concise book."
3,There are better options,"This book is OK and I'm glad I bought it, but the author spends too much time on the theory and history of antique radios. Only about 1/3rd of the book is devoted to troubleshooting, and even that part is a little bit sketchy. I think a person can find better troubleshooting manuals, tube manuals, and other interesting literature for free online if you just spend a few minutes searching. It has been my experience that the New Jersey Antique Radio Club is a great resource.Mr. Carr wrote a great book, but you can do better online."
3,What this book is and what it isn't,What this book is - a good general reference guide to electrical troubleshooting and electrical repair of old radios.What this book isnt - no mention is made in regards to cabinet or chassis repairs and restoration. Nothing is said about wood refinishing or speaker grille cloth replacement as well as other cosmetic restoration concerns.
2,Nice book on radio theory,"If you want a book on how tube radios work, this is a great book. If you want to know how to actually restore radios, not so good."
5,Outstanding Book! Best in class!,This is an outstanding book and a must-have for vintage radio repair. This books covers theory very well and also the basics of radio repair including necessary equipment and troubleshooting techniques. For those who may think that this book is too heavy on theory...well...perhaps they should find something else to do. Repairing anything requires knowledge of theory because there are no cookbooks for such things. This book is the most outstanding work that I have read on this subject to date. Highly recommended.
2,Less talk more action please...,"This book is heavy on the theory side. If you are looking for a book to help you restore an old radio (like the title implies) pick a different book. If you are wanting to learn the theory behind radios and how different tubes work then this book may be for you.Personally, I have a few old radios from the 30's to the 50's and wanted some practical advice. This book has a small section that will help you troubleshoot if you have all the old tools, but none of the instruction I was hoping for. I guess my expectations were too high. I'm now looking for a more hands on walk through of restoring a radio chassis."
4,excellent tech book,"Had to read this textbook for a Masters class (MBA). Was worth the time. Simplistic, informative, entertaining and technical all at the same time."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I think Phil's ego filled up most of the pages. Good reading but I expected more. He was born to play hockey, no doubt. If you cut Phil Esposito he bleeds hockey."
5,ESPO SCORES,"THIS BOOK BY FORMER NHL SUPERSTAR PHIL ESPOSITO REALLY IS A GOOD READ. PHIL TELLS US OF HIS CAREER WITH BRUINS, BLACK HAWKS AND RANGERS. ALONG THE WAY WE LEARN QUITE A BIT OF INFO ABOUT PHIL. HE TELLS US OF HIS FAILED MARRIAGES, OCCASIONAL FLINGS AND HIS SUCCESS AND FAILURES AS COACH AND GM. PHIL HAS A VERY LARGE EGO AND DOESN'T PUT UP WITH ALOT OF BS. IF HE FEELS HE HAS BEEN WRONGED HE WILL LET YOU KNOW. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND REALLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL HOCKEY AND ESPECIALLY BOSTON BRUIN FANS."
2,Sports athletes not very interesting people.,"I read this book because I grew up on hockey and Phil Esposito was definitely foremost in his profession. He was top NHL scorer of all time, until Wayne Gretzky, unofficial captain of Team Canada in 1972, so I really put him up on a pedestal.But reading his book, I was hoping to plenty of insight into the 1972 Russia series, instead I get a diatribe about how plastered he and others were on the plane ride home and how he told Alan Eagleson to f___ off. In fact, if I had the capability to download this book, the f word probably would have returned a few thousand hits.Phil does give some insight into pro hockey culture and it isn't pretty. His New York Ranger teammates after morning practices had no idea what to do with themselves so the majority would park at the local bar until closing time or passing out, whichever came first. How interesting!If you're really kean on reading, do what I did and borrow from local library."
5,Great Book,"This book is definetly worth the price you have to pay. Esposito takes us deep in to his life, from his childhood, to the Blackhawks, Bruins, Rangers, and his fight to get the Lighting. He also talks about marriages and playing for canada. This book is definetly full of rich info not scaled down. So if your thinking about it, get this book, it's worth it.Also Recommended: Messier by Jeff Klein"
3,Jesus Saves and Espo Scores on the Rebound !,"Worth a look.. at the library. Phil is one of my all-time favorite Boston Bruins but, he exaggerates a little too much on some of his far fetched stories."
2,Pretty disappointing,"After recently reading ""Tropics of Hockey"" and Ken Dryden's ""The Game"", ""Thunder and Lightning"" was a bit of a disappointment.The 5 or 6 word sentences wear thin very quickly. ""I loved hockey a lot."" ""We sure had a lot of fun."" ""Boy, those girls were hot."" Just not as insightful as I had anticipated. If you'd like to learn more about the '72 Summit Series, by all means pick up ""The Game."" The only thing of real interest was his process of getting the Lightning franchise off the ground. However, even that could've been written without as many, ""Yeah, I liked him a lot because he liked me a lot. He was a jerk because he wouldn't do it my way."""
2,At least it was inexpensice,The sight was badly mis-alligned. good for the price and the seller was very professional.
2,Disappointed,The DVD player came with no video and audio cables.The DVD player itself is fine but hard to play without cables.
1,less than fair,"It didn't even come with a remote so no way to choose menu on dvd for scene selection, etc....brand new dvd skipped while playing it on this crappy magnavox."
1,I'm on my 6th one!!,"I have had to replace this item 5 times, and today the 6th is going crazy. I bought it from Walmart, so they keep replacing it for me, but it's gotten to the point where I want to cut my losses and get a DVD player that actually works. The longest I've had one is 3 months before it stopped working. What an inconvenience!"
2,Good while it lasted...,"I got this as a Christmas gift from some friends after my last DVD player gave up it's ghost. It's now July...about 7 months later...and this player is dead already. It was fine up until a week ago, where you had to open/close the DVD tray several times to make it read a DVD. Now it won't recognize any disc at all. Sure, it's cheap...but only lasting half a year is still too short for any kind of product to be considered a good buy - at least in my opinion."
4,Some good old Cajun music,"Nathan Abshire is a legend as far as I am conerded. Here is a collection of great old Cajun tunes. Some are quite old and therefore the quality is poor, but this is history in Cajun music. It is well worth it."
4,Wonderful George Lang Memoir,"This is a great book written by the famous Hungarian restraunteur, George Lang. With recipes! Good for anyone who remembers him from his NYC days at Cafe des Artistes."
3,No self esteem problems here......,Mr. Lang has been blessed with talent and a lot of luck. As with anyone that has been faced with adversity I admire them like all get out when they manage to succeed and so it is with Mr. Lang. I have no doubt that his great big ego (gosh it's gotta be heavy carrying all that around) is well deserved. I however had a hard time stomaching some of this stuff he was spewing. His having done this and that and taking all the credit for it kind of got on my nerves. While he claims he is a nice man I got the distinct impression that if you weren't somebody then George wouldn't have a lot of time for you.
2,Low end software.,"Handmark offers a very wide range of software for mobile devices. Perhaps that accounts for their poor support of a more serious product, MobileDB, a PDA database program that interacts with Excel spreadsheets. Database users often make a considerable commitment to their software, as did we. So it is frustrating that Handmark has chosen not to support MobileDB for Excel 2007 or Windows Vista. Moreover, it has proven difficult to remove the vestiges of MobileDB from our desktop.We're now running a trial version of HanDBase, a competing product. It seems to reflect a significantly higher level of software expertise and developer commitment. It works with Windows Vista, Access 2007, and a variety of Palm and Windows Mobile devices.Since the handheld arena is a volatile one I suggest caution in committing to any Handmark product that will be put to a serious use."
1,Good Contents - Poor production quality,"I like this dictionary because of its contents. It covers a wide range of Urdu words and is a good source of Urdu-to-English words. Since Urdu script is some times loose with vowels, it is good that the pronunciation of words in given in parenthesis in English alphabets.The only grouse I have against this book is its poor quality of production. It is printed on very poor quality paper. On some pages, the ink is very faint and it is difficult to read the words. There are black ink smudges on some pages. The pages emit a strange 'kerosene'-like smell. I would have returned this book, but I am retaining it only because of the usefulness of its contents."
2,Not so good,"This Black Stallion book is not as good as I expected. Alec acts like a know-it-all snob towords Steve. And at one point he tells Steve""You can't just race Flame. To ride in races you have to have years of training and experience"" Which in reality,of course,is true,but where were Alec's ""years of experience"" when he races the Black at Chicago? By the time I got to the race,I wanted Flame to win. Overall,not a bad book, but two stars for the way Alec acted.(the Black is as good as ever)"
5,If you have pain do this workout!,"A really good friend of mine suffers from chronic pain and started reading Pete Egoscue's books and then started doing his exercises. I hadn't seen her for a few months, but when I did I could see the difference in her personality and posture. She could not stop talking about this workout, and went on and on about how much it was helping her.I added this to my exercise regimen as I have an old injury that acts up from time to time on the left side of my lower back. Consistency with this workout is key, and I did this workout every day for an entire month and my back pain as well as some shoulder tightness was gone.Now I do this a few times a week and still benefit from the workouts immensely. Every time I do this workout when I'm done I always feel so good. The time flies and my whole body feels great.Egoscue is a genius and this is the most simple way to feel good and be pain free. I can't recommend this enough."
1,Why bother?,"--Was skeptical after reading the first page, Longarm getting married. --Was more so after page 2. ""I'll have a big challenge learning the cattle business from scratch."" I am sure that the staff writer who was filling in for Evans knew that Custis was a trailhand when he first came West after the great unpleasantness. --Page 3. This poor excuse of a writer introduces 'Custis Longarm'. Unaware that Longarm is a nickname. Really Mr. Evans, where do you get these writers. Could you at least school them a bit on the main character, or perhaps make it mandatory they read at least one of your works before they lower your credibility further.I never got to page 4, took the book back to the bookstore and got my refund. Keep up the good work Mr. Evans."
4,Excellent. Spencer's writing is witty and poignant.,"I don't know why Scott Spencer is not more widely acclaimed. His writing manages to be incredibly well crafted, beautiful, funny, witty, poingnant, and ironic all at the same time. This is the 4th book of Spencer's that I have read and his writing always manages to touch me emotinally and engage my intellect. Some sentences just make me sit back and say...""this is remarkable writing..."". Dylan fans are certain to get a kick out of this book."
4,Dylan connection is no turn off - a fine novel anyway!,I read this novel because I've been enjoying Bob Dylan's music for over 25 years. But I found myself admiring Scott Spencer's ability with words regardless of the Dylan connection. The book stands on its own as novel and has made me want to read more of this author.
4,A good contemporary novel but high literature it's not!,"I like Bob Dylan, and I like the premise of this book; it's fun to read about places like P.S. 41 in Manhattan if one grew up there. This tale of the quest for the absent father has some good writing in it, but it is no better or worse than a dozen other ""literary"" novels. The prose is good, but not innovative or especially perspicacious concerning the measure of the human heart. But then who am I to judge. I'm just articulating my views in this silly forum, while Scott Spencer has made tons of money with ""Endless Love"" and other work. More power to him."
2,Far from his best,"I liked his other books better...and you can get them in paperback. If you JUST LOVE the Sixties and light matches at Peter Paul and Mary concerts, you'll probably be sentimental enough to enjoy this book. His other books make the Sixties come alive in an interesting and positive way; this one falls flat. The main character is an unappealing wimp and after finishing half the book I didn't really care how his quest came out. In addition, this book is sloppily written and poorly edited -- there is absolutely no excuse for robotically following a spell checker that wants to change ""minyan"" to ""minion"" especially when this occurs in the middle of several pages of Hebrew/Yiddish words...I guess we should be grateful that it didn't become ""minivan"". Two stars is generous; one and a half is more like it. But his other books are worth a read."
4,No Sense of Direction,"For anyone wishing they could just pack a bag and take off with no particular destination or itinerary in mind, this book might give you the incentive needed to pursue such an adventure. The author had some very good luck in getting into some place, Russia for one, without the necessry travel documents. I suspect this would not be possible today. It was an interesting and quick read--every enjoyable."
3,Enjoyable read,"This book is a nicely written somewhat introspective narrative of one man's journey about his travels around the world. Well done. Not a travel guide and quieter that a drama filled action log, just a real person with rich experiences that are believable and real. Well done."
5,Good read,"A lively, light travel yarn well worth a read! There`s plenty of excitement to keep your interest as well as helpfull travel tips."
3,good round the world story,Enjoyed the trip spent watching your money but still seeing and doing a lot.Good tale and a fun read especially while traveling yourself.
4,A traveller's tale,"""No Sense of Direction"" is an engaging read. The author, Eric Raff, really does take off to travel the world without an itinerary. For a year his world is that of the backpacker. He follows his instincts and finds himself in unfamiliar situations which adds an element of suspense to the narrative. Mostly however life is life and people are people and things work out. Raff's keen sense of observation is very useful for anyone seriously considering taking off to travel the backpacker's trail. Raff's easy manner attracts a mix of traveling companions who accompany him along the different stages of his journey through Eastern Europe, China and South East Asia. ""No Sense of Direction"" is an honest, tell it how it is, tale, a must read for those who enjoy a no nonsense, keen, lively and companionable account of one traveler's journey."
4,Fun read,"This was a fun read. He is a good economical traveler. I think he went prior to 9-11, so some of the travel he pulled off would not be available due to heightened security today. I enjoyed seeing a glimpse of other cultures and the freedom he utilized in travel."
3,A travel journal,"No Sense of Direction is about a NY advertising executive who quits his job, takes a year off to travel anywhere he wants. The story itself is interesting, which kept me reading the book. He is a brave traveler, not shy about things. This sometime makes him seem insensitive to other cultures, especially in Asia. But, he seems to make his way around the world, with only the English language, which is great. However, the book is not well written, with to many repetitous phrases, ""...collecting our backpacks..."" being one of them. I would think this would be obvious after a while. One chapter ends with the plane landing - ""...we sped across the dark tarmac like a bullet."" and the next chapter begins with ""We stepped off the plane...and crossed the dark tarmac to the customs hall...""Mr. Raff seems to run out of adjectives.The book is any easy read, and I would recommend it, just to follow the adventure."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Not far into the book before I groaned. This New Yorker, on his way to Copenhagen, lands at ""London's Manchester Airport"". Not much point travelling around the world if it doesn't help your geography, is it.I hoped that he would not eventually fly back to New York's Los Angeles Airport.But I found the book quite an enjoyable read. Eric Raff conveys well the feeling of travelling without much of a plan, meeting up with, and parting from, new companions, almost all much younger than him and in fact leading him astray at some points.Through his eyes I saw the soft underbelly of travelling as he uses pretty downmarket accommodation most of the time and takes risks such as entering Russia, with the intention of crossing it to China, without a passport.But he survives, and gives us a very interesting tale while doing so."
4,Entertaining,"I found him entertaining. Easy read book. I'd say it was informative but I have no way to prove/disprove it. However, it was a very interesting book and insight into what travelling was like for him in these countries. He did go on an on a bit but it made his book more charming and real--as if he was writing in his diary. Some may find this annoying. I rather enjoyed his descriptions. I could almost picture them in my head."
1,A Pain to Read,I was hoping for a nice read of personal experiences of a novice traveler on an unscripted adventure. I started to skim after 20 pages and gave up before I was 30% of the way through. The contradictions of wanting to travel on a budget and then bribing train conductors to save a few hours wait on a platform was a killer. The recounting of ordinary mundane details also turned me off.Maybe I missed the good parts in the latter 2/3 of the story? Or perhaps the authors impatience in not wanting to waste some precious hours of his life waiting for transport transferred to me and the time I was wasting on his account.
2,Very childish writing,"Why did this man NOT have an editor? I kept wanting to re-write it. It should have been an interesting tale, but the style in which it was written makes me think he just copied it from his journal. The conversational ""quotes"" were particularly unnecessary.The tedious telling just petered out in the end......I suggest that he actually study the genre, then lock himself away for a re-do."
4,A travel adventure worth reading.,"I found this book to be a fun and interesting read. I haven't been able to travel all that much, and certainly not to any of the places the author went. His descriptions made it come alive in a way that made me want to book a flight and take a year off work! The people he met along the way really make the story. I read it over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it.This is the author's first book and definitely worth checking out!"
3,Stone By Design,Caught a TV article on Lew French - CBS Sunday Morning. What a fabulousartist! I bought the book based on the show. The book was not as goodbut not bad. It's still very interesting stuff with some beautiful photography.
2,Picture quality leaves something to be desired,"I was disappointed by the quality of the paper and the pictures in this book. The subject matter was of great interest to me, but I don't think this book did it justice."
4,Stone by Design,"I saw a CBS documentary on this guy, and it was absolutely amazing to watch him work. The way he chooses stones, and fits them together seamlessly, is one of those crazy forms of genius most of us can't quite imagine. So to see the final outcome of that work in Stone by Design was really fun. Alison Shaw perfects that tricky tactic of photographing what is already great art, and to hear Lew French's stories behind his structures is an insight into the mind of a true American artisan. A really great coffee table book, or a gift for anyone interested in masonry, landscaping, and art."
2,Not really what we had expected,"We bought this thinking it would be more helpful in doing our backyard and other areas. Wasn't as useful for that as we had expected. Discussed how to actually work with stone - carving, shaping, etc. - more than ideas we could really use (unless we were building a stone building entirely from scratch, that is)."
5,Fabulous ideas for working with stone,"With spare text and pages of striking photographs, Stone by Design showcases the exuberant craft of the master mason, Minnesotan Lew French. While frequently working outside, on garden structures, walls, ponds, and pathways, he is equally at home working within the confines of a house. His mosaic fireplaces display a design sensibility that manages to capitalize on both the strength and an inherently playful aspect of stone. The conclusion of the book, a lengthy interview entitled The Making of an Artist, reveals a thoughtful and sensitive craftsman, who cites three primary influences in helping ""formulate my ideas about stone."" Despite their different approaches, architects Frank Lloyd Wright and Antoni Gaudi, and the artist Richard Iammarino, with whom French has collaborated, each serve as inspiration for French's own challenging and innovative twist on stone work."
3,"Not Lily Bard, but it does satisfy the Southern Lit. fix","I'm addicted to Charlaine Harris's books. I've read almost all of them, and scoop up any new one as quickly as I can. If you have already read the Lily Bard series, you will see some similarities. As her books always are, this is a captivating read. However, I feel like the characters are more forgetable than the ones in her series.Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun read with murder and mystery in a small southern town. It's just not as interesting as some of her other work."
2,Read one of CH's series instead!,"This just wasn't compelling. The characters were not quite stereotypes but they weren't fully fleshed out or vibrant either - they were just kind of there, doing things I didn't particularly care about; there were times when I knew I should have been horrified or sad or satisfied, but I didn't feel it, which is a shame because the subject matter should make a reader feel. I enjoy all of CH's series work but that standard of writing just isn't present here."
3,Worth Reading,"I went into this book knowing what it was about and that it would be completely different from her later writings. I had not heard real good reviews, but I wanted to see for myself. In light of this being one of her first books, it is good. There is just a huge difference in the writer then and the writer now. One of the problems is when you have the Aurora and Sookie books to compare it to, nothing is really going to measure up to them.It was worth reading, and it was about what I expected, but not my favorite of hers by any stretch. I was a teensy bit disappointed by the abrupt ending. That being said, I still adore Charlaine's books and will read them all."
2,An early work,"This is one of Ms. Harris' earliest works and shows it. Read it if you must read everything by her, but I would start with either her Shakespeare or Roe Teagarden series. For those who like a wee bit of supernatural in their mysteries - the Southern Vampire Mysteries (two books currently) are fun.There is the promise of the strong herione that becomes the mainstay of Harris' books, but this story is one of her weakest."
4,Not bad,"""Sweet and Deadly,"" another one of Harris' early works, is boring. This one is much better, a good quick read. It's interesting to see how her writing evolved."
2,Difficult to read through.,"I love CH, but I had a really hard time reading through this novel. I know it was a dark subject matter (rape and serial killer), but it really was an awkward read for me story flow wise. The writing did not flow well, and it really did not have the needed hints in order to let me try to figure out the mystery. However, I read it because CH wrote it and I have read EVERYTHING she ever published under her CH name. It's funny to me to see that she got this published, as most agents always put on their websites that they don't want anything about rape or abuse. Not recommended for anyone underage, as it is really graphic/violent."
2,"1300mAh Li-Ion Battery for Magellan RoadMate 800 , 860 , 860T GPS",Bought to replace the worn out battery. This one isn't much better. It takes forever to charge and then if it's not used for a couple of days it has to be charged again?
3,Arms are fragile,"I bought two of these bar stools for my kitchen counter on an Amazon deal. They arrived in three days in very large boxes (it looked like I received a small washer and dryer). Assembly was very easy and they look VERY NICE. First time I sat in one, the arm snapped right across the hole where the arm mounts to the chair back. Dang! Just as other reviewers had said. I am not sure what to do and am thinking maybe I will just leave the arms off. The chairs are tall (bar height probably) and I may do as another reviewer and take 4"" off the bottom of the legs."
2,Bar Stool Evaluation,"These are really beautiful stools if you have the space for their rather large footprint. Unfortunately, both of the left armrests were machined poorly on the two I bought and the wood split when I tightened the fastening bolts. I have not been able to find a method for requesting the company to send replacement armrests so I have the option of returing the entire stool (extremely difficult) or using them with cracked armrests. It is too bad that Amazon doesn't seem to have a system for addressing this kind of problem."
2,Fairly poor quality Asian furniture. The reason you don't buy from just a photo.,"I purchased 2 of these for our kitchen because the photo and description were attractive. Unfortunately, the quality of the wood was not very high. If you are not careful during assembly, you will easily split the arm rests, as I've seen other customers mention. The dilemma is to leave the arms loose, meaning you can't insert the wooden plugs to cover the screws, or try to tighten them and hope for the best. The pieces simply don't fit together snugly, so you are putting pressure on this lightweight wood as you attempt to tighten the screws.These were also packed in styrofoam that was pretty smashed up, causing it to get all over the place, as well as into all the small gaps in the furniture itself.Worth $100? Maybe."
1,Horrible! Arms break like twigs!,"I ordered 4 of these bar stools in 2008. One arrived with a crack in it, and the arm proceeded to break off. Since that time, two more arms and a leg rest have broken off two of the other stools. The stools are pretty to look at, but extremely poor craftmanship with pieces breaking off left and right."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Talk your way to it.A novel way to keep things going, and keep things together. Not your baic engineering, but a whole lot of chanting and stuff. Oh, and the Doctor has to face off with the Master, with the usual groovy companion, for the fate of that whole ball of wax cosmos sort of thingo."
5,Finding myself in The Amber Photograph,"I am fairly new to fiction, but a friend who knows a lot about my life, asked me to read The Amber Photograph. After reading it, and never been a fan of fiction, I thought that such fiction is really truth wearing masks to protect the guilty.Anyone whose life has been damaged by rape, or if you know someone who has experienced and survived should read this book. It would be a wonderful book to give as a gift .. and what a gift of love. I am so grateful to my friend Trudy, for urging me to read it. But a word of warning, have a box of kleenix near by, or include it with your gift. The Amber Photograph has helped my own healing process, and I am grateful to the author, Penelope J. Stokes for writing it."
3,Long wait,The book is fine but it took a month to arrive. Would have been an issue if I had been waiting for this for a gift.
2,This author has done better,"I wouldn't recommend this book. I was disappointed. Characters not well developed; so-so plot. I'm reading ""The Blue Bottle Club"" by Penelope Stokes & it's 100% better!"
2,sad book,"I had hoped for more from this book. I found it to be very sad and not a good read. Sexual abuse is the subject of this book. The Characters were not well formed and I felt a huge part of the story was missing to help fill in the blanks.Read the writers' other books, but skip this one!"
5,BIGGEST 1/18 WWII FIGHTER TO DATE,"I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THESE 1/18 WWII FIGHTER AIRCRAFT A WHILE NOW AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS P-38 LIGHTNING IS BY FAR IS THE BEST FIGHTER PLANE I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS FOR A 1/18 SCALE.THIS P-38 LIGHNING IS ""WOW"" HUGE AND SO FULL OF DETAIL.I JUST GOT THE ""PUTT PUTT MARU"" OF MCDONALD FOR CHRISTMAS AND I'M VERY GLAD I DID.BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A P-38 LIGHTNING WITH YOUR OTHER 1/18 PLANES YOUR MISSING OUT ON A GREAT DETAILED AIRCRAFT.21ST CENTURY TOYS DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS P-38...I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO COME OUT WITH A NEW VERSION P-38 IN 1/18 SCALE OF THOMAS MCGUIRE'S ""PUDGY V"" WHO IS AMERICAS 2ND HIGHEST SCORING ACE IN WWII."
2,NOT FOR A CHILD!!,"This is a very nice adult airplane, but not recommended for children as the box says. After a few crashes there are numerous things that have to be glued back. The details & overall looks are great & for any collector this would be a wonderful addition! My son loves it, but is just to young to appreciate it's beauty right now."
3,My Favorite Aircraft.,It is a very nice toy model. I thought it should have shown the Ladder placement for boarding the aircraft. The landing gear doors do not seem to have a default position when the gear is extended. I hung mine from the ceiling.Since I flew the F-4 and F-5 Photo version I would like to see a similar model of the F-5E photo version that had the dive brake and hydraulic ailerons. Thank you for a good model.
1,Stress rating of 5 stars,"There were no directions in the box, the pieces would not fit properly and the action figure was broken. The plane was also a much different design (painted) than the one pictured on the box."
5,Better than the average fairy tale,"This is a marvelous book for children. Unlike typical fairy tales, the princesses in this collection of stories are not ""damsels in distress,"" but strong, powerful women who can take care of themselves. These aren't male-bashing tales, either, but stories where women and men work together, before living happily ever after.These stories have all the qualities of the old-fashioned fairy stories: dragons, sorcerers, knights, witches, and princesses. They are quite enjoyable, with little life lessons here and there, and everyone living happily ever after. I think any kid would enjoy these, boys and girls. And it teaches that girls are just as good as boys."
5,Great Cable,"This extension cable was exactly what i wanted. Its a good sized gage pretty thick but not too stiff and still lightweight. It has good end pieces that don't accidentally fall out. It was also cheap, and got here pretty fast.definately a good buy"
4,It works,"I am using this to extend the usb cable on an IR receiver I have next to my TV, to a computer in the basement. This extension cable works, and I haven't had any issues with lost data, which is a big plus, and can be tricky for a 15ft cable.The price is pretty good, I only wish it was available in black, but since it's mostly inside the wall, I'm not sure I care THAT much."
5,"A History of Modern Europe French Revolutiuon to Present, Merriman","I bought Merriman's ""A History of Modern Europe"" as an adjunct to my studying Nineteenth European history in the Teaching Company's DVDs on the subject. I am partiuculatly interested in the period between Bismark's unification of Germany and the beginnings of WW1. Altho the trigger on WW1 was pulled in the assination of Austrian Archduke Fendinand, the national entanglements over the years preceeding this set the stage for a world wide conflict - this text book surveys this period very well. I think Bismarks alliances are complex, and any text that can untangle these are a welcome source of information. If you are to have only one survey book on Modern European History this is the one."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,The torso for the outfit is a lot shorter in length than it looks in the picture and since the fabric does not stretch much it makes for an uncomfortable fit. If you buy this make sure you order a larger size than you normally wear.
3,Runs small!,"I wear a size 6 or 8 and the medium is tight on me and the leotard really short! It's a leotard so it is really uncomfortable, and it is not stretchy. Might be cute if it fit! A tough thing to order online."
5,Happy Doggy,"My 12-year-old Husky goes crazy for these - they are healthy, delicious (apparently), and a great training tool. They are a little pricey, but worth it for the joy in my dog's face."
5,Dog loves these!,"Our dog loves these--all the wellness well bars, not just this flavor. They do seem to be a little hard, great for cleaning teeth but maybe not if your dog has teeth problems. Nice healthful treats."
2,Bad for teeth,"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars. The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd. As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness. After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars. It sticks on pretty hard. I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it. This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet. I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this. They're also made by Wellness.Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog BiscuitsOr, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce"
1,wellness wellbars,"tried wellness webb bars, whitefish and sweetpotatoes and with crunchy peanuts and honey. have three dogs two just push them away, the third who will eat dirt inhaled them. Rate this products as a 0."
5,My dog loves these treats!,"My dog loves these treats. He has a problem with wheat (not sure if it's an allergy or what, but after cutting wheat out of his diet, he's stopped throwing up regularly), so I found these bars and decided to give them a try. They're meatless as well, which is great because I'm not too comfortable with the quality of meat that dog food companies use. Even though they don't have meat in them, he still goes crazy for them! They're pretty big, too, so I break them in half (easy to do). My dog's a chihuahua, so half is the perfect size for him. Breaking it in half also makes the box last even longer! :)"
2,Dogs don't like. Get the soft chews.,"My dogs love treats and will eat nearly anything, but they don' like these. I love Wellness products, but they missed the target here. Get Wellness soft dog chews instead. They are more expensive but your dogs will love them."
5,Crosspoints,"Here's a novel destined to become a true classic. Incredibly rich and complex in plot with some of the best drawn characters ever seen, it's simultaneously a deeply philosophical novel of ideas and a fast paced, exciting, and sexy love story that can be read over and over again.This book is extremely hard to put down and absolutely impossible to forget. A moving experience in every way."
4,If you like Ayn Rand...,"...you will like this book. For those of you looking for a new way to feed your Ayn Rand fix, this book does its job.It's a solid romance novel with important ideas about individuality, morality and art.Whether you like Rand or not, the discussions and ideas about art in this book make it a must read for any artist of art aficionado."
4,Gift and giftee liked it,Gift and giftee liked it. This one is beyond me but I am not a linguist. Giftee is PHD in linguistics
2,very uneven quality,"I have enjoyed many chapters in this book, but I cannot recommend it. The complete exclusion of Native American languages was a damning error, despite the editor's excuses. But more than that, the book is ruined by the uneven quality of the included essays. The chapter on Arabic by Alan S. Kaye is of particularly low quality. Let me quote a sentence: ""I should also mention the elegance one can immediately feel when one is invited to DINE vs. plain 'ole EAT."" [My caps repesent italics in the text.] I find the use of ""plain 'ole"" for what presumably must be ""plain ol'"" (=""plain old"") ridiculous and hideous, and the inclusion of such incompetence in the text shows the editor's indifference to the final quality of the book."
2,is what it is,"Was forced to buy this for a class. More historical writing on the Chicano / Chicana movement, than a feminist ""theory"" book. Save you money and check it out from a library."
3,Works great if they don't break first,"I live in MN so we have some harsh winters. The problem with these things is that they are cheaply made. It's all plastic. I have no idea why the sharp end (that goes into the ground) is not part of the light. If I have to remove it (for lawn mowing), the light comes apart and the sharp end stays on the ground. I bought 24 of them and 5 of them are already broken. I love the look but it would have been better if they were made from aluminum or something."
4,Sterling silver bracelet,I liked the bracelet. I liked the details on the bracelet. This was a gift for my bestfriend and she loved it.
5,Principles of Critical Care-book,"I know this book from my residency years,when I rotate in ICU,and this book is an authority in the critical care specialty.Clear and update,the Best."
4,Half Satisfying Half-Track,"This vehicle is good but not great. But it can be the basis for customizing & super-detailing. A few small improvements could have made it a better product right out of the box. As it now stands it requires a number of parts tinkered with in order to bring it to a better level of accuracy acceptable to the older child or collector. The forward MG shield is non-swivelling, the vehicle markings should have been on a separate decal sheet, the spare road wheel is better as an optional part. This toy isn't intended as a model kit - but the little things make it a semi-model kit. It is adequate for a younger child but not quite so for someone not inclined to make the improvements."
5,Awesome,This is a great addition to your 1/18th scale collection. It only comes with one man so you need to get some panzergrenadiers to fully put it to use. The only complaint could be that it is impossible for the figures to sit on the benches inside. But in real life the men prefered to ride on the sides anyways.A panzerschreck comes with the vehicle as an added bonus. The tracks rotate to complete this very accurate rendition.
3,Godinger Freedom Small Footed Cake Plate,"I bought the Godinger Freedom Small Footed Cake Plate for about $11, just before the price went up to $36. The box arrived very damaged. I had wanted to give this as a gift, but changed my mind. I did bring this to Amazon's attention, and they issues me a 20% refund. Other than that the plate is nice, but a little too small. Can only hold a cake the size of one of those mini cake pans."
1,The product that we receipt was not Crosman Branded,"The product that we receipt was not Crosman Branded, was a not-branded 12grm CO2 cartridge but sold at same price of Croman branded products. this company must put in clear what kind of product are they offering for sale, for quality assurance.What I am sure is that this cartridge are not crosman and it is very expesive and sure it is not same quality and this store must be warned that those kind of trick are santionated by the Internet Crime Complaint Center, www.ic3.gov"
3,"Very basic, but good","Shetler does a pretty good job of presenting the very basics for Asatru as well as giving practical, down to Earth advice for applying Heathen concepts to day to day living. It can be used as a pretty good quick-reference guide. I would recommend it to someone who just wanted to know the very basics, but you might want to go with something else if you desire more indepth knowledge."
5,Well pilgrim you can talk the talk...,"...but can you walk the walk?I knew Dux for a couple of years, well before he wrote this book. I can say he most certainly practices what he preaches. In fact, this is my second copy (I loaned the first out and it never came back), and probably won't be my last. It's a good introduction to the ethics of Asatru, with clear examples. About the only thing I found lacking was that he could have gone into a bit more detail on some things. Maybe in a future edition?Bob"
4,For a newcomer,"As a newcomer to Asatru I found this book a great introduction to the aspects and beliefs in Asatru, A great bibliography at the back is also included which has spurred me on to making even more amazon book purchases.But most importantly it is well written, well worded and very informative!! :)"
4,Good stuff,"I liked the Graves era of the Misfits, as I thought he was a great vocalist. I hadn't listened to any Graves stuff (besides demos off Web of Dharma) until I picked up this CD and I really like it. My only complaint is that the CD is short, clocking in around 25 minutes. The artwork is really cool. I plan on picking up the other Graves albums now and look forward to them."
2,Like a High School Misfits cover band,"Disappointment.This album sounds like a bunch of high school kids got together on the weekend and recorded Misfits-esque songs in their garage.The sound is so terrible, it detracts entirely from what could be a somewhat listenable album.Now the poor mix could have been made up for by truly rebellious, agressive attitude or edgy lyrics, but even these are missing from the drab drone of songs like the ""We Are 138"" rip-off, ""1119"".I'm glad Michale is still recording and I look forward to his future discs, but this one doesn't cut it.Like a guidance counselor to a struggling student, to Michale Graves I have to say, ""I just don't think you're reaching your full potential""."
1,most over rated punk artist ever,michael graves should have stuck with the misfits. this album bored me to tears. nothing catchy on this disc at all. dont know who gets into this dribble.
1,Awful. Absolutely awful,"I bought this based M Graves singing for the Misfits (which I enjoyed) and trying to support Horror High Records. I listened to about the first 3 songs, and destroyed the CD. (Horror High supported, my dignity reclaimed.) The music is repetitive, the lyrics uninspired, and it is without a doubt, a waste of your money. Go find something else."
1,This guy needs to just stop,"I'm sorry, but Michale Graves is a MEDIOCRE singer. Bottom line. No, I am not blasting him for not being Glen Danzig, but I'm not gonna praise the guy for it either. This could have been the next Misfits? There should never be another/next Misfits anything, and this is coming from a Misfits fan. I love Marky Ramone, I love Dez Cadena. Nonetheless, it's not the Misfits! Let it go. Michale Graves spouting off on his conservative tangents makes me wanna puke. How pathetic is it when rock n roll is now sponsered by Fox News?!"
4,good product,"i bought this to connect all my accessories on my truck. its a really good buy. a little expensive, but it worth it"
5,Blue Sea 12 circuit Fuse Block,"Product was advertised well, very high quality product, would buy more products from this company again."
3,It's a fuse box,"I re-wired my 12 volt system and installed a new power inverter on my camper, and this box worked fine. I little pricey, but couldn't find anything better."
2,"weak, somewhat deprecated","xul appears to have changed a lot since this book was printed.many of the xul tags discussed and used, the xul templates used,have changed. thus, most of the xul examples in the book arenot going to work in firefox.e.g. the xul css skin url is no longer the same. lots of tagssuch as ""titledbox"" have been renamed.i'd say this content is deprecated.also, in my opinion, these chapters add no valueto the book and in general weakens theexisting content:an xml primercssthe jxul project"
3,Quickly out of date - wait for 2nd edition?,"I bought this because because of the JXUL project. To the end I found this book very handy to understand that basics of XUL programming and quickly got me up to speed.A lot of time is spent talking about Mozilla (obviously). The problem is that a lot of that content will be quickly out of date. Discussion of other projects like Luxor, Xavier and the enhancements made in Mozilla since being published would make a welcome second edition. May-be wait for Mozilla 1.0."
4,This was a pretty good book,"I think it was a pretty good book. I think this showsthat people should ask for help-but shouldn't dependon that person to make they're life a fantastic life.Elizabeth gave them good advice, but they didn'tuse the advice in a way that it would be useful. I thinkthat it should be called Sweet Valley Twins and Friends,because amy and Maria were in it a lot. I liked thisbook. It wasn't the best-but it was pretty great. Lizis cool person to read about.-Anna Hycla"
4,ESIA,"elizAbetH bEcomeS An advicE Columnistbut people rely on her good advice too much and blame her when things turn out wrong. the book portrays how elizabeth puts too much pressure on herself,tries to be too strong,feels the need to be perfect,and never asks for help."
3,"ok, but too hard for my puppy to make squeak","I bought this for my Corgi puppy as a toy to make noise to maybe keep him interested in it longer, but the rubber is too hard for him to make it squeak. He chases it and can chew on some parts.The toy seems very durable and would be even better for a larger dog."
4,still squeaker problem,"This is a gift to a friend's dog. She had the same one before. But, the squeaker was broken long time ago. Then other dogs living in the compound chewed it and made a big hole. all dogs love this toy. That's why I got her replacement. The squeaker doesn't last, but dogs still love the toy itself."
5,Perfect Toy,"Great toy. This is the second one we have got because it Is our dogs favorite toy. This first one is wearing out after two years of constant paying and it still squeaks. She plays with both the new and old. This is the only toy our dog has had that the squeaker still works, she usually distroys them in most toys in a matter of minutes."
4,"Good quality grip, but...",The finger grooves spacing is a bit too far apart for my hands. For reference my glove size is medium.
5,Absolute Quality,"Upon looking at my options and shopping once I had my correct measurements needed, theInello Chrome 12"" Paris Faucet for Vessel Sinkswas exactly what I needed. The connections are nice and tight in our bar faucet. We didn't even need an adapter although I can see where some might (do your homework BEFORE buying, as with any product that requires matching your plumbing). Highly recommended, it appears as though this will work well for years given its quality."
2,Non-standard water line connectors.,"This faucet would have been perfect for my vessel sink setup.Unfortunately, the water line connectors that comes with it is non-standard.I needed 3/8 O.D. This one comes with 1/2"" connectors.So, this is going back."
5,Ridata BDR,I have been with Ridata since Bluray Burners hit the market and have not had a problem with them since. It will depend on what brand of burner you use but they are usually listed with these BD-Rs. These blanks have become very useful and have saved me so much space on my hard drive. I recommend them.
4,Ridata BDR-254-RDCB15 4X BD-R discs,"These single-layer BD-R discs work fine with my LG WH10LS30 internal BluRay burner, with the exception that they burn at only 2x rather than 4X as advertised, which means that it takes about 40-45 minutes to complete a disc, not 20-25. But that may be due to a problem with my system (or the burner), not the discs. The only BD-Rs I've tried (so far) that burn at 4X are non-LTH Verbatim BD-Rs (the LTH versions burn at only 2X) but they're considerably more expensive, though just as good. Regardless, out of about 40-50 Ridata discs burned so far I've yet to get a coaster. Very good quality at a reasonable price."
4,Good quality BD-Rs.,I've had very good burn success with these. From my limited Blu-ray burning so far I had fewer coasters with these than Verbatim. Memorex has actually been the best for me so far.
1,Don't know why!?,Looking for saved some money and ended losing it all. I do NOT know whay I bought this piece of s...
1,Cheap Medias vs. Quality Ones...,"What is the real problem with all of these cheap Blu-ray sets? (Verbatim, Memorex, Ridata and so on...)They cost little and last little too. The thing is when they came out people started buying those ""Cheap Medias"" and once they received them and used them for few times they would write a 5/4 stars review, then when a few months have passed, most of them lose the data or video and 1/2 stars reviews begin to emerge...You can notice this by selecting see all reviews and organizing them by ""Newest First"". Then you go to the last page and you will see how the first 5 to 10 reviews are 4/5 star ones. Then the first person to take the risk of doing a 1/2 star review gets hammered by all others, and few months later you see how 1/2 stars reviews are more common and people begin to accept them...The whole idea of my review is to advice you about the inaccuracy of the product ratings and some of the reviews. Do NOT be fooled... ""You Get What You Paid For."""
5,Good for Christmas letters,"We use these 6""x9"" envelopes for Christmas letters that are essentially two-sided photo montages. Thus we can fold the 8.5""x11"" letter once and minimize creases in photos. This envelope size meets current post office criteria for standard first class envelopes (currently $0.34 stamps)."
3,readers,i am an international students and want to read books called readers. i am graduated from university also.
2,Mediocre quality,This is NOT a Corelle piece. It's made by someone else. I think it was a little misleading to list is under Corelle Callaway Coordinates along with the other authentic Corelle Callaway products.
3,Can't handle real hot stuff,"I bought this piece to go with my other Callaway items by Corelle Coordinates. This is a nice trivet, but I did put something far too hot on it and it peeled somewhat. Not for freshly off the burner stuff!"
2,OK,This product is alright. Goes well with the rest of the Callaway. Nothing too special though. I could've done without it. Made in China.
1,Not what it seems,"I returned it. Ok if this items is only Top shelf dishwasher safe how am I suppose to set hot items on it? Its made of plastic I was afraid of ruining my pans. Another product made in China, mine came in a Corelle Callaway box but it really doesnt flow with the rest of the set at all."
5,Caramia!,"These are two of the finest dolls ever produced by Mattel. Morticia (Barbie) has beautiful black hair with dark brown strands here and there. She wears the signature black dress with ""octopus"" hem, black stilettoes that won't stay on her feet, and beautiful ruby-red lipstick. She tops off with an exquisite ruby necklace hanging from a detailed gold chain and a coordinating, oversize ring. Her arms are molded to stay in the signature pose, she even has the red extended fingernails! Gomez (Ken) is also a work of art! His face is even detailed with the lines and creases in his forehead and cheeks, and, of course the moustache. He is wearing a the perfectly detailed pinstripe suit with a silk lining. His hair (Not the cheap molded plastic stuff, it's REAL!) has multi-color streaks, he even has a little pocket watch and silk tie."
5,Had to have it!,When I saw this set at KB toys(years and years ago) I had to buy it. It was on mark down for $25.99 and I snatched it right up! I'm glad I did. Although the box had some minor damage I couldn't let it go. The dolls are very nice looking. Do I wish I could open the box and touch them? Yes! But I don't. It's still unopened. Great buy for me!!
2,So Hard to Forget is so easy to forget,"This book is a good read for the avid romance fan. However, it is not a book that I would read over and over and over again like so many of my other books. Max is a great character who falls in love with a client's daughter. Nicole is a man Max is investigating who has a daughter who looks just like the woman Max fell in love with. This book has some great twists to it."
4,It was Good!!,"Winter Roses is a good romance book that was written by Catherine Spencer, set in Canada it is about a guy named Thomas Whitney and a lady named Meredith Blake."
3,Haven't really used it,"I bought this as a way to relieve hip pain, I did a few of the exerices, but haven't really used it."
5,Egoscue: Pain Free workout,"For someone with back pain &/or hip pain, this is a wonderful workout. Using it daily can actually decrease your pain significantly. It seems to target the cause of the pain & works to correct the problem."
5,Egoscue work out CD,"Egoscue: Pain Free Workout Series, Vol. 1 and 2It takes about an hour to go through these great stretching exercises, but is well worth it! I'm feeling stronger and younger every day!"
4,4 Stars for Technique,Like the technique--the system really works. The video is so-so. I have the book and did find purchasing the video as helpful. If would recommend going for the book over the video if you need to choose one.
1,HOW CAN THIS BE !!,WHAT BOLOGNA...AFTER ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS OF THE SECOND DISK BEING DEFECTIVE AMAZON STILL SENDS ME A BAD 2ND SEASON !! COME ON HOW ABOUT SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE !! ITS A KNOWN PROBLEM AMAZON !!!! GEEEEEZ
2,bad disk,"I can't believe that no one else has complained about the second disc in the Season 2 series. I am on my second copy and they both will not play the episode, Rocket to Oblivion, all the way thru. It will get to a certain point and then skip back to the same part. I have been unable to watch the middle and ending. I have tried it on both my DVD players. Same result. You can't access the missing parts by chapter either.The rest of the remaining discs are fine. As well as all the other episodes. I must say the Amazon return policy is great. I had a replacement the same day I shipped the first copy out. I don't blame Amazon. I blame the company, which never answers the phone. They have to know they have a problem."
1,Bad 2nd DVD,"I'm on my second set of ""Banacek Season 2"" and am having the same problem as others. On DVD 2 episode ""Rocket To Oblivion"" when play gets to the 3rd chapter, it hangs and reverts back to the beginning of the episode. This is poor QC on the part of Arts Alliance America (Hart Sharp Video). Kudos to Amazon for the speedy replacements."
4,BANACEK--THE SECOND SEASON,DVD of two season TV program from years ago. Plots are quite involved. Banacek solves what seems to be impossible to solve thefts.
4,Banacek,"I Loved it as a child on TV and it is just as much fun watching it now, one added bonus is seeing the progression of Peppard from an adult aimed Banacek Role to his A Team role."
3,Second verse same as the first,"If you enjoyed the 1st season of Banacek, you'll enjoy the 2nd season. More of the same from George Peppard, Ralph Manza, and Murray Matheson. The highlight of the second season set is the pilot to the series which wasn't included in the first season release due to either legal or licensing issues(?)."
3,came twisted,"This came in a clear plastic bag and the film that was exposed was all twisted.I don't know if that's just how it comes or if was take out of a 2 pack and sold individually.Either way, i would rather by the 2 packs that come in a protective plastic case in the future and not a single one like this."
5,Well detailed and BIG..,"I found the 1/18 scale ""Stuka"" dive bomber extremly accurate in detail in both the details of the plane itself and the flight crew. If it were not for the lack of correct tail markings this ""toy"" would be a museum piece. The next point is the size of the plane. The picture on the website does not do justice to its scale.The only negative is the wings were extremely difficult to attach and may not be suitable for a child to assemble unaided.I would highly recommend this plane for any collector.Sincerely,Scouts87_90"
5,ugly,but it is cool awesome detail i hope they keep up the good work cuz if they are this nice i will keep buying them cum on p-38. a b-25 would be nice too heck ill take one of everything! a-z ww2 airplanes.
5,Super,"Stuka! Images of mass dive bombings come alive with this great plane. As others mentioned, be careful with putting this together and have patience( and a phillips screwdriver). The wings are difficult to put in so be careful and do it right. Also be very careful with the bomb-holding carriage, they are thin plastic and will snap very easily.Removing the legs of the men will help in fitting the pilots in their seats and save a big hassle. The missing swastika is replaced by a tilted cross (it looks quite silly, but otherwise the markings are fine."
5,Stuka!,"This is great. Very detailed. Missing swastika is only major historical flaw (inverted cross is really stupid though). Only warning would be to take your time putting it together. This is not for children! Bomb holder is soft plastic and breaks easily. It is also quite difficult to fit the piolots in the plane (but do not give up). Once in they probably should stay put.In closing, Buy it!"
5,Powerful Memories,"I served with Company A of the 720th Military Police Battalion from December 3, 1969 to Nov. 11, 1970. Starting out as a machine gunner on a escort jeep and advancing to driver of a V100 ( named the Devils Disciple ) this was the first time I had ever read any full length description of my Battlion and Company. I was set back to read about the exact things I did especially what we called Operation Night Overtake but in Ricks book it was officially called Overtake Darkness. Realizing I had photographs of the very places Rick discussed..the Newport Bridge, the Phu Cong Bridge, Highway 1A and many of the places we escorted convoys was not only very exciting because it was up close and personal but brought back powerful memories of my tour. An outstanding book for all former Combat MP's who served in the Nam...I am very thankfull it has been written."
2,A must for those who were MP's in Vietnam,"I was a proud member of Co.C, 504th MP Battalion, spending most of my tour in Bong Son in the Central Highlands. This book not only explains the various roles of the combat MP, but it allows us to see what other units were doing."
5,the book was cool,I think that the book is cool because the writing is okay and i think that the book needs pictures in it
3,Not accurate about me,"I don't know about the other 19,000+ authors but Reginald got two items wrong out of a possible 5 in my name and dates entry. On page 829 he states: Rock, James A(nthony) 1929- above the entry for my science fiction pseudonym bibliography ""Who Goes There."" In fact the correct entry would be Rock, James A(lbert) 1944-I don't mind the wrong middle name so much as I do boosting my age by 15 years. Where did he get that?"
2,Hopes dashed,"I gobble up every rally game I can get my hands on. When I found Sega Rally 1, I played it till my fingers bled, Although a little to ""Arcade-like"" Sega Rally 1 was good fun. So I bought Sega Rally 2 without hesitation. Disapointed. This game at the arcade is good fun, but on the PC it's almost undrivable. With my wheel I bounce from wall to wall and all attempts to tame it by tweeking the settings failed. So it was shelved. Save your bucks or better yet spend them on one of the many more enjoyable rally games out there."
3,The Department of Correction,This book had a flimsy plot and none of the characters were appealing. None of them seemed to have 3 dimensions. I was disappointed by this story.
4,A thrilling novel of psychological suspense,"A tautly plotted and grippingly paced novel. The NY locales are brought to life with a gritty, hard-edged realism, and the characters become living, breathing people trapped in a terrifying spiral of death and deceit."
3,Master of the Weepie,"Bobby Goldsboro was the master of the teen weepie song in the 1960s. This collection includes his great hits Honey (The weepie to end all weepies), the sensual Summer (The First Time), the mellow singalong Hello Summertime and the nostalgic Watching Scotty Grow. It also contains covers of other classics from the period like Roberta Flack's massive hit, Killing Me Softly, Perry Como's And I Love You So, Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline, Johnny Nash's reggae number I Can See Clearly Now, The Hollies' He Aint Heavy ... and Carole King's It's Too Late. This is nothing earth shattering but Goldsboro has a warm, engaging voice and there's nothing wrong with the material. If you like good songs well interpreted, this album's for you, especially if you want to go on a trip down memory lane."
4,First amp install,"They seem to be good wires. I don't have much to compare to but the kit came with all I needed to get the job done. But yes the fuse holder doesn't make sense with the metal exposed on the bottom, other than that its all good!"
3,a,its kinda sucked fuse hold couldnt keep water out had to use silicone puttyd to make sure it didnt see any wanter
5,Excellent kit,Exactly what I needed and came with plenty of length for everything. Everything seems very durable as well. Definitely recommended.
3,It will be ok I guess.,"Cable is nice/easy to work with. The fuse enclosure is a joke, I would not mount it to anything your battery could ground too, I mounted mine to plastic. The RCA cables look and feel cheap. The battery cable came cut at about a foot so you could place the fuse... 1 foot is not enough to make it from the battery to the fuse, probably won't be for some other people too, had to buy some 4g battery wire from Walmart to make the gap, it would have been fine if the cable wasn't touched. Ground cable was the perfect length for my install and the speaker cable seemed sufficient.Even tho it is possible that I'm just loosing my mind, I didn't see it in the description (Amazon's and dbLink.net's) that the battery wire was cut, also this is my first install so it may be something I should just assume is cut, donno, just thought I would toss that out there if I need to be corrected."
2,"Bad design fuse holder, everything else ok","As a previous reviewer pointed out, the fuse holder has a bad design is which the mounting screws are exposed on the bottom of the fuse holder; the very side that it's supposed to be mounted. Not much of a problem if you are mounting on plastic or wood, but if you plan on mounting this to the car's metal, then you'd have the positive only 1 or 2 millimeters away from negative ground... which would be disaster if they made contact. I could see the plastic fuse holder aging, becoming brittle, and eventually cracking. Really bad design in my opinion. I ordered another fuse holder which doesn't have this flaw. Everything else in the kit was ok, thus the 2 star rating. But I'm just shaking my head at the design of the fuse holder... wondering how this thing could actually be put on the market???"
5,Awesome Product,"Its a great AMP kit.I used the kit to install my Pioneer GM-D7500 amp into my 94 honda civic coupe.you will need to find a good tools to strip the power and ground cables, there think. that is in no way a negative, i like my cables shielded.the 100amp fuse is pretty big, about 4 in long, which makes it a little hard mount it. I currently have mine wedged in next to the cars battery.its been in my car about a month and i have to complaints.its a good quality, inexpensive, amp kit. BUY IT"
1,Item short parts,My kit came without a grommet and it was 1 large connector short. I had to go buy new connectors and a grommet so I could get the install done right. Thanks DB Link ( not Amazons fault )
1,Another piece of Sony Crap!,"I bought this television less than a month ago and have had to have it replaced 3 times before I got my money back. If you type in google (Sony XBR3+cloudy) you will find forum after forum with people reporting their t.v.'s have the cheap LCD back light leakedge. All three of mine had it in pretty much the same places and nothing is more annoying than watching a movie or a show that has several dark scenes in it, and seeing clouds of gray in the picture. IT IS THE WORST and Sony will not acknowledge it. They say it is normal. THE HELL IT IS!I would avoid this t.v. with all cost until next year when they finally get their crap in a row. Typical Sony crap! They wonder why they are loosing billions of dollars a year."
5,Best TV out there right now!,"I purchased this TV several months ago after waiting over 2 years and reviewing a lot of TV's. What I have found is that EVERY TV out there, despite whatever technology it is, has a gripe or complaint out there. After looking at several TV's over the past 2 years, countless hours reading avs forums, going to peoples houses, spending hours at electric stores, I firmly believe this is the best TV out there right now. I believe the only thing close could be the 60"" SXRD XBR3 or the pioneer plasma, but this is the best. I went back and forth over and over on these 3 models. After playing XBOX 360, DVD's and HD programming, I wouldnt trade it for anything out on the market today. BTW, I have NO clouding issues. After reading AVS forums for years, I tend to believe that people can see whatever they want to see if they stare at the TV long enough. My only gripe over this tv is no 1080p over component"
1,Biggest disapoint ever with a Sony TV,"I bought this TV almost 3 years ago. So far I was so happy with it. amazing color, definition, great black, etc. suddenly, while I was watching TV, the colors change. everything started to look weird. Skin tones became green, yellows became red, etc.Today an authorize Sony repair company told me the ""panel"" is bad and I have to replace it. To fox the TV will cost $1,570.00. This TV is less than 3 years old and I watch TV less than an hour per day. I always have Sony TVs in the past and this is the first time something like this happened. Big disappointment in Sony."
3,It was ok,I bought this cd for one song. I ended up liking 5 songs in total. I cound have bought a mixed cd or a best of Jah Cure insead.
2,didn't last very long...,"lasted me a little over 2 years before the rust cracked the welds. at the very beginning, i loved the vortex. i'm just sad that it didn't last longer. 2 yrs is much too short of a lifespan"
1,server shut down,Did not get to watch movie server shup down just as movie was getting started. This happens too often with movies
2,Where is the beef?,"You'd imagine a book titled 'Images of Barbarosa' would be rich with large phorgraphs. Not so. This book has small images, rarely more than one per page, and is no more than a glorified survey of the war. Might be entertainig for someone not familiar with the conflict, but if you are looking for a pictorial collection, don't bother with this one."
2,Not worth it,"I picked this book up looking for a good overview of Barbarossa with a lot of pictures. Well, there are a lot of pictures. However, if you want a good overview of the Operation, look elsewhere. There are almost no maps, so the author's narrative of events becomes very abstract for those who haven't memorized Russian geography. The narrative itself is not bad, but is rather dry. As for the pictures, which should be the crowning jewel of this book, there are almost none from the Russian perspective. The author's personal collection was used, and appears to be entirely German. The few pictures he inserts of Russians who are not not captured, shot, or blown up, come from elsewhere. The book should more appropriately be called ""German Images of Barabarossa."" I recommend Osprey's Ostfront for a more well-rounded, better written and visially appelaing introduction to Barbarossa."
4,Good tape.,"This tape is much better than the first Curly Classics tape. They obviously realized their mistake from the first tape. The shorts there were not really classics. Here, they have MEN IN BLACK and MICRO PHONIES, which are really classics. This tape also includes THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS, a great classic, co-starring Lucille Ball. The Curly Classics DVD is better because it includes A PLUMBING WE WILL GO, Curly's best short, in my opinion. Adding one more short would make this better, but still a good tape."
4,DOWNEYS Liquor Cake Sampler,All cakes in the sampler arrived in good condition and indvidualy wraped foil packed in boxes .Cakes were fresh and moist and had were full of flavor ! All in all not a bad Product Though I would have like more intense Liqour Flavor My self ....Steve Jones
5,enigmatic,"Amiina (formerly amína) is a quartet from Iceland comprised of:María Huld Markan - violinHildur Árslsdóttir - violinEdda Rún Ólafsdóttir - violaSólrún Sumarliadóttir - celloThey are best known for their work as Sigur Rós' string quartet on the album known as ( ), as well as Takk... and re-arranged the string work on Ágtis Byrjun so that Sigur Rós could tour it.Kurr is an eclectic work of great beauty where the simplest sounds become a real basis for making music. The melodies are incredibly simple, both elcetronic ad percussive but they make up a distinct sound somewhat like the music of Rae Howell's Australian group Sunwrae.The overall effect is hypnotic as well as being part of a new minimalism coming out of Northern Europe and Iceland.This is their second release but the first in this minimalist style. Well recommended"
4,Best Tiger Tiger Replica So Far but only OK Toy,"If you looking for the most detailed and best-manufactured toy replica of German Tiger I tank, then you have found it in 21st Century's 1/18 Scale Tiger. Only people who read Jentz books, passionately study Hilary Doyle drawings, and know what RAL stands for will be able to find the problems with the accuracy of the replica. As for kids, they will think the Tiger is pretty ""cool"" for about as long as any toy could hope for in the post Play Station/Game Box world. The toy is really a much better desk display piece than an toy. However, having stated this, I must relate that my 9 year old did not demand the return of would be armchair armor display piece to the toy store on his birthday last month. I am sure the Tiger will see much yard combat this spring."
5,Great detail of one of the greatest tanks of World War II,"This is just an outstanding model of on the greatest tanks to roam the battlefields of World War II. It struck terror in the eyes of American, British, and Russian foot soldiers. The detail in this large sized tank is excellent, with authentic looking war-era markings. If you like German tanks, this is a must have. I also own the Panther tank of this scale (1/18), which is also a true gem."
5,A W S O M E !!!,Its simply the best yet from 21st Cent. XD.This is not your daddys tank !!!A Collectors item.If you need a Tank this Year. Its a Must have !!!
4,Buyer Beware!,"<rant>*ahem* I absolutely love Fushigi Yugi, and I am currently tryng to see the entire series (even though I know the ending...) but anyways, I would like to warn people of something about the OVA's formatting.If your like me, you probably buy a mix of subbed and dubbed tapes, pretty much anything that is available. Well, for the OVA I bought the first tape, dubbed. It contained episodes 1-3. Then I bought the second tape, subtitled...and it contained episodes 5-7! I couldn't believe it, I had TOTALLY missed episode 4 (which, btw, I didn't notice until after watching a episode 7). So WATCH OUT, make sure you check to see what episodes are in the tapes before you buy them!</rant> *^_^*P.S: Chichiri is a cutie, eh?"
5,"::grumbles at the reviewer:: YES, IT'S GREAT!","... This is in response to the ""official"" reveiwer. I saw these episodes in Japan, and there isn't really a time mess up. The whole time out-of-whack thing is due to an illusion, so there is no ""problem"" or ""difficulty"" with the OAVs. :p Of course, I say that realizing that it may have been changed when it was brought to America.ANYWAY.... ^.^ I am almost certain that this is the most entralling section of the series. Not only is there trouble back in Kounan, but Suzaku bugs Miaka in her dreams, asking her to return (pesky gods can't interfere on their own, you know). You find out more of what happened to those in the book, and I warn you, there is a tear-jerker scene with Hotohori's ghost!"
5,Go Fushigi Yugi!!!!!!!!!!!,"I found out about Fushigi Yugi from an obssessed friend.At first I thought it was just another over dramatic cartoon like Sailor Moon, but I soon learned that it was funny and different from any other anime I'd ever seen.I recomend it to anime fans^_^!!!!!"
1,Failure to deliver.,"I have a RepairMaster 5Y warranty for an LG washer dryer. First it took them 2 weeks to honor the warranty. I have a cracked drain hose which, due to LG design, and confirmed by a call to LG, is only technician-replaceable. The RepairMaster/Warrantech warranty is filled with exclusions not printed on the card you receive when you buy the warranty. When I described the problem to RepairMaster/Warrantech, they refused to fix it, stating that it fell under their exclusions. They claim it is an external user-serviceable part in spite of LG claiming that the connection is internal and not user-serviceable.RepairMaster/Warrantech has a C- rating with Better Business Bureau. I think any company that sells their warranties (including Amazon), should also have a C- rating."
1,Poor Service,One month later I still DO NOT HAVE WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is getting ridiculous. If it does not arrive soon I will be reversing the charges on my credit card that was ALREADY CHARGED!!!!!!!!
4,Their Last Ten Miles,"This is an outstanding novel based on historical facts of the ""War between the States"" climaxes with the Battle of Selma. Wayne Flynt, Historian, Distinguished University Professor, Auburn University states; ""It is fictional, it is believable and good read"""
5,Exciting and Dangerous Sailing Adventure,"I loved the sailing in this book, especially the chase of terrorists across the Pacific. I also like the author's attention to the fact that those out on the water every week are America's first line of defense against terrorism. This was my best summer read. It was hard to put it down. The facts in the book are also historically accurate. I highly recommend it!"
4,A little light...,"I have never used indoor corps sticks before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I was hoping for was something a little smaller than standard size, but with the same density and large acorn tip. These have a good tip and are slightly smaller than normal, but they are also surprisingly light, which is rather off-putting."
3,Not what I was Expecting,"I was disappointed in the book because I was expecting a deeper philosophical or theological content. The book was basically a collection of little homilies using some of the compassionate teaching attributed to Jesus. The content only loosely made the connection to becoming more human. The author is conceptually correct, but did not adequately ""make the case"" and ""close the sale"" on the thesis suggested in the title."
4,Indepth & exhaustive review of CPI's,"This book gives a lot of information about the history and development of the chemical process industry (CPI). Although a little old (published in 1989), it gives lot of insight about the future of chemical industry based on the current trends. Full credit to the author for covering as much information as possible, however, the verse could have been made more readable. The book mimics a handbook on organic chemical industry, but I think of it as a virtue rather than a shortcoming. A book recommended for chemical engineers who like chemistry."
4,Fast track to learnin,This book is entirely in Japanese. No romanization. This is great as it offers you exposure to reading Japanese and quickens your ability to remember both the hiragana and katakana characters. Do ensure that you purchase the translation as well. You will need the translation as you won't be able to understand this book without that.
5,Great Book,"This book is amazing, I like the way how is structured and the activities are very useful and interactive.I really recommended it to all Japanese students."
5,Try something almost impossible and learn Japanese language!,"Wow! I would never believed even my wildest dreams, if somebody had said me a year ago: "" You will study Japanese next year."" These days, I studying it! Minna No Nihongo:Book 1 is my guide, help and anothet teacher! If you gonna start Japanese studies, you should choose this book because this is the so clear and makes your Japanese studies easier!"
5,"Excellent, trustworthy","I didn't feel comfortable with buying stuff through internet, but I needed this book and this was pretty much the only way to get it, so I gave it a shot. Although the book had been previously used, it looks pretty much new, it's in pretty good shape, and it arrived to my door unscratched. I recommend buying through this seller."
3,The Ma Grinder,"Curiously unsatisfying. Sounds like music played in a studio with adoring technicians hovering (somewhat noisily) in the background. I have listened to the CD 30-40 times and cannot shake the impression of an older performer dredged up for the the session sounding like ""someone playing a piano"". Little morphic resonance with the original settings and inspiration for the music materializes. Somewhat like watching a movie from the projection booth, where the mechanics of the projector are the primary focus. Would much rather hear the original, analog records, which (for all their ""defects"") contribute to the ""feel"" of the original inspiration. To experience this music we do not need to hear the ""spit hit the microphone"". The sound is suitable for pseudointellectuals looking for ""tonal progessions"" to pontificate on, instead of the ""rekits"" made by innocents in a time long ago and once upon a time."
2,Confessions of a former script kiddie,"Two years ago Mr. McNab was a teenager running rootkits against random web servers. Now he is supposedly a professional pen tester.This book is the latest clone of Hacking Exposed, a theme that gets a new title every month. The addition of checklists reeks of big four style mechanization. What people on the outside, looking in, don't seem to understand is that real hacking/cracking is not about running tools to exploit known vulnerabilities. It's about reverse engineering and hand crafting new attacks. Otherwise you're just repeating the same tired lines about social engineering and using buffer overflows against unpatched systems. Nothing to see here folks. Move along.I'm disappointed in O'Reilly for publishing this title."
3,nice book but unix based,"the book is good, but its almost totally unix based, I downloaded the tools and they all require unix systemswe just use Microsoft, and 99% of our clients use MS onlyReally should be called unix security hacks"
5,Better than Hacking Exposed,"This book is a great resource for any administrator with IP networks to protect. As Wes Boudville says, it certainly is systematic with some great guidelines and useful checklists. The high level concepts laid out by the author make it much easier to understand the underlying issues with security nowadays. Instead of listing bugs and patches, McNab explains the different bug types, and I learnt a lot about stack and heap overflows in the application security chapter.I'd recommend this book over Hacking Exposed and other books with the word 'hacking' in the title. The assessment material is comprehensive from both Unix and Windows standpoints, and I certainly picked up a bunch of new tricks that I wasn't aware of before. The book has great coverage of all the latest tools and techniques, but written in a timeless way. At just under 400 pages you'll find that it's not too long either!"
5,This book on audio rules!,Joe Mantegna is great. I think that the audio works better than the actual book for this piece of art because of him. If you mix both the audio and the book probably it will give you a better understanding of Sun Tzu's teachings. I may try it myself.
2,Not what I expected,Too little of Gale Harold for my liking - i decided to buy it only cause Gale was in it. I felt sympathy for the child/young man in the movie but have to say overall it was a bit of a different type of movie and one I would not rush out to buy. I did enjoy seeing Gale in yet another type of role. Seems he cannot be typecast in anything but QAF.
5,Bay Area Guy,The attention to detail is awesome. The city fountain goes great with other Ultimate Soldier sets.
1,Not As Advertised,"I paid for fast shipping, it arrived 3 days after the wedding. That became a mute point however. I would not have given this bit of junk to the bride anyway. The photo of the handkerchief is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I received a ""grayed bit of machine stitched"" fabric. It certainly was not ""hand embroidery"" and the Belgians would not like to be represented by this. Very poor quality. I am glad I found another beautiful handkerchief from a different source that the bride loved. I think I'll use this one to scrub the sink. !!!"
4,"King Crimson, Henry Cow lovers take note","RIO, Jazz/Fusion, progressive, call it whatever you want, this album is one of the better surprises from 1999. Kada is one of the many new bands to emerge from Hungary's fast growing progressive scene. Definitely influenced by Henry Cow, King Crimson. Loaded with great bass-guitar riffs, sax-like horns, guitar and drum riffs, Kada manages to make an album mainly filled with improvisations ""anything but boring"". Right up there with the best that King Crimson and Henry Cow ever did with the improvisational jazz/progressive rock scene.Highly recommended for fans of that genre. The one thing (IHMO) that this album suffers from is that it is all instrumental. Would have been nice to have vocals.However, the packaging (complete with 5 card art pictures) is brilliant.I look forward to more by this band."
3,Once an Eagle,"My husband and I saw this movie in either 1978 or 1979 and as far as we know, it only aired once. It was excellent and we tried numerous times to purchase it but never could. When I read that it was available a couple years ago I surprised him with it as a gift. The story itself was still very good but the DVD got stuck in 2 different scenes. Somewhat disappointing."
4,Once an Eagle,"Fast delivery. I bought this for a friend of mine, so it was a gift. They loved the movie and they have been looking for this movie everywhere. I am glad I was able to find it for them."
4,Great Sam ElliotGreat story of per,Great story of perseverance. History of the era was somewhat accurate but the story line made up for it. Entertaining.
4,Once an Eagle,"I have looked for ""Once an Eagle"" for some time, Sam Elliot was terrific in this epic and I wanted my Dad to see it. Enjoyed it very much."
2,Learned too late....burned good,"It is good to see a wonderful mini-series like Once An Eagle, but tragically we get only part of the whole. If there be someone who can sell the whole movie I'd sure be interested. Seeing the thing I bought just makes me want more of the movie"
4,Sam Damon Returns,"This DVD is very special to me. I have eagerly awaited its coming for over 30 years, ever since ""Once an Eagle"" premiered on broadcast TV on NBC as a minseries in 1976-77. Tom Hebert, the man who made it possible for a new generation of Americans to experience ""Once an Eagle"" for the first time, deserves a special thanks from all patriotic Americans. The DVD transfer is excellent, although I am saddened at the complete lack of ""extras"" for such a seminal minseries. The editing is also a bit choppy. Aside from these two ""nit-picks,"" I can heartily recommend ""Once an Eagle"" to all Americans who believe that patriotism, duty, and honor must NEVER go out of style."
2,once an eagle not complete.,"once an eagle states it is 520 minutes long but only 7 hours is shown. the orignal movie goes from WW1 to vietnam era where Gen. Damon is killed, but this version only stops at WW2. The editorial review states that it goes up to the vietnam era. When will we see the complete movie???"
5,Best of Mini Series War Films,"I have been watching all of the war mini series movies that were originally released for TV. This two disc set of DVD's that lasts over 7 hours is well worth the purchase. If you own Winds of War and War of Rememberence, this will be of interest to you. The price on Amazon makes it worth the purchase rather than to view it under a Netflix option account."
3,Trips at the finish line.,"The movie series remains fairly true to the book, but fails miserably at the end. It does not present the 'lesson', nor does it give the viewer the opportunity to weigh the possible choices. What IS the right thing? Only the book can take you there."
5,DVD Miniseries,"Excellent! Very glad I made this purchase. I really like Sam Elliott as an actor and respect his work, so this DVD will be enjoyed well into the future."
2,Once an Eagle,"Once an Eagle is a mini series I have been looking for a for a long time. I was happy to find it on Amazon, however, the first DVD disk had several place where it froze and skipped."
5,The Greatest American War Epic Ever Filmed!!!,I've been waiting for this mini-series to appear on DVD for over ten years! The book is fascinating! This production translated very well to film! The producers and director took their time to get everything right! I highly recommend everyone who wants to see the growth of a soldier to watch this film. The book is required reading in the USMC. Order this DVD! You won't be sorry! Sam Elliot was perfect for this role!
1,Incomplete miniseries,"This DVD miniseries is in 2 disks. Disk 1 contains chapters 1,2,3 and disk 2 contains chapters 5,6,7,8. You will note that neither disk contains chapter 4. This is a major ommision. This probably accounts for the shortened running time which is far less than shown on the case. It probably also accounts for some of the 'name' cast characters not appearing at all in either disk. Also disk 1 has a hang up of about 2 minutes during which the screen does not advance. Additionally the color reproduction is poor. I have recommended to Amazon that they pull all copies of this product from their inventory and have the film studio provide Amazon with a complete and better quality version of the miniseries."
3,Caution with Timeless Media,"Just so you know, Timeless Media who brings you this package has the reputation of presenting EVERYTHING they release cut and edited in one form or another. Some products are butchered to death and some less so but they are not complete. If you can accept this then go ahead and buy the discs but if you expect full, pristine releases, you will be dissapointed. This is not a judgement review, just a heads up of the products they carry. Thanks."
2,Review of the DVD (not the movie),Two hours of the miniseries missing without a trace. Is it an incomplete movie that you want to watch?
1,A real disappointment,"I don't remember this mini series when it ran on TV, now I know why. Yes it has actors/stars you will know, some with only two or three lines but the acting is uninspired. I was hoping for so much more after reading a number of reviews. Yet in the end, I just wanted to be done with it. It does cover lives of two career army men and their families, but I just could not get into the characters. I have been a Sam Elliot fan for years, but this was not something he was allowed to shine in. Over the course of time, the men aged, a little bit, the women didn't. The battle scenes were absolutely some of the worst I have ever seen. This mini series came across as a low budget effort. Maybe it is just me, but this was not what I would call an epic minis series by any stretch of the imagination. In the end, just so bummed that Once an Eagle never flew."
5,Finally!!!,"I have been waiting for this for a long time. Just an outstanding novel.I understand this has been required reading at west Point for some time. Reminds mea bit of Wouk's Winds of War series in that it is partly historical with a great fictionalthread woven within.Still pertinent as there are officers and then there are OFFICERS. I saw it in my hitch as an Armyenlisted man as I'm sure others have. Sam Elliot was great.An officer like this in real life was Col Hackworth, who always told it like it was, imo.Take that Rumsfeld."
1,CHOPPED TO DEATH AND INCOMPLETE,"I first read Once an Eagle as a boy in a Reader's Digest Condensed Book that my Mom got at a yard sale. When I went into the Marines, I read the full book, and purchased my own copy which I have read several times.You can imagine my anticipation when I ordered the DVD set, only to find that the version being sold had been cut from the original by nearly two hours. What makes it worse is that the DVD Set ends at the conclusion of World war II, and not in the 1960's where the book does. I did enjoy what I watched, but it was cut up so badly that anyone who knows the story will be left hanging. Save your money."
4,Entertaining Mini Series,"Entertaining mini-series, especially if you consider it as a stand alone movie and don't try to compare it to the book. I just finished re-reading the book for the 4th time (over a 30 year span) and it is hands down the best book I have ever read. Should be required reading for all military officers. The mini-series obviously misses the depth and central messages of the book. Some of the obvious event and character changes from the book work out okay. I was disappointed early on in the movie on the differences from the book, but it got better as it progressed. Overall entertaining and a good value. Not sure if I can watch it a second time, just because of my intense love of the book."
4,Once ab eagke,"The best military show about the differences in warriors and play soldiers. In peace time, play soldiers rule, but in times of war, we always call on and need, Warriors!!!!"
1,Once an Eagle,"Don't wast your money. Poor acting, Should have sent it back. Sam Elliott is just into the sound of his voice."
5,MASTER TV SERIES AND DVD,ALL SHOULD SEE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID FOR US IN THAT TIME. NO ONE LIKES A WAR. BUT SOME HAVE TO SERVE AND WHO BETTER THEN A LEADER OF MEN. GREAT DVD
4,Good movie,I enjoyed watching this movie series. The acting wasn't first class but the story made up for it.
2,Once An Eagle,I have been trying to get a copy of this mini series since 1976 when Sam Elliott first made this. I have a recorded copy of it but wanted the real thing. This is one of Elliott's great works. It shows the military like it really was and Elliott plays the part well. If anyone hasn't seen this don't miss it. Thank you Sam Elliott. I wish they would come out with Aspen another one of Sam Elliott's great works.
3,The book is better.,"I read the book when it was first published (and a couple times since); and saw this series back in (was really that long ago?) 1976. Terribly disappointed in the latter because, even at a really long 7+ hours, it left out so much of the book. I understand, from reading a couple other reviews, that the book is required reading at West Point and with the Marines. Will the TV version now become required viewing in place of the book? I sure hope not (although Sam Elliott is an ideal Sam Damon)."
2,Disappointment from a Previously Great Band,"I have to admit, I was really looking forward to Wheat's return after their last album Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second. That CD was fresh, interesting, and implied either a next step into Indie greatness or maybe a fizzle into nothingness. Instead, they've gone for something ambitiously different and badly missed. None of the songs are compelling; many are unlistenable. The music is atonal and nihilistic, the melodies are either bland or bad. This will be last Wheat CD."
5,Muppets On Wheels,"Excellent for kids. Went to my local thrift store and found it for $0.49! Don't buy it from these guys who are trying to rip you off. You can find it, just be diligent."
4,Nice,Happy with the set. Good quality. The ice bucket is on the smaller side and it does not come with ice tongs. All in all a good set.
1,So so...,"I was buying my fiancé a bar set for his birthday. Although this was very well priced, and seemingly perfect upon receipt, it is very poor quality. The item has been used about five times since buying it in the end of January, and it is rusting and tarnishing, much to my dismay. I'm fairly certain we will have to throw it away soon, as it is a health hazard to have something rusty come in contact with food stuffs."
2,Pretty lightweight,"The big pieces (the tray, shaker, and I guess ice bucket) are attractive, but the tools are flimsy lightweight stamped-metal things. The jigger has BURN marks inside it from where it was spot-welded to the handle. The ice bucket is very small, too small to hold a wine bottle on ice. Pretty junky overall."
1,Nine Piece Hammered Finish Steel bar set,I did not care for the quality of the item. It appeared nicer on line. I sent it back to the company.
4,What a good actress,"I like old movies and this actress ""tiene cojones"" has guts ,there is not so many like that anymore..."
4,Brilliant music from a brilliant man.,"I had the honor of meeting John Jackson a few weeks ago, and on that occasion I also bought this album, a collection of tracks from his '60s sessions. I must say that the songs on this disc blew me away. Songs like Red River Blues, Black Snake Moan, Tombstone Blues and John's Rag all display his incredible guitar talent and (save for John's Rag) his very unique singing voice. I've seen him live, and this is VERY close to the real thing- perfection."
4,Basil,I saw this item in an art store. I was intrigued by the man that I came to call basil. I decided to look online and see what other work Rafuse has done. The piece is a pleasure to look at and people often ask about it. Sick.
4,Enjoyed the book. LaVyrle is unsurpassed at her craft.,"I enjoyed the descriptions in this book of small town atmosphere. She also included shopping for antiques, outfitting a bed and breakfast inn, and problems in relationships between families. Starts out kind of heavy with a grief counseling seminar, but becomes positive early in the book. The only criticism I have is the fact that the male character is sleeping with his wife and his lover at the same time, not usually part of LaVyrle Spencer's plot. Overall, a very enjoyable book - one of my favorites."
3,Not as soft as hoped,"The reviews led me to think this ball would be a soft hit, but it is only barely tolerable. I did not want to pay for a leather ball because I am not an avid player, but it seems that leather is the only type for a comfortable hit. I do realize volleyball isn't a pain free sport, but I have played with balls that are much better. In a nut shell, the outside material of this ball is soft, but that does not mean little sting."
2,Will not do for a rugged environment.,"Mikasa volleyball lasted for less than a month of daily hard playing in a rugged environment. Luckily they were affordable and I purchased 2 at the same time, not sure of the quality. Should be fine for back yard use."
3,a little bit heavy,I feel this valleyball is a little bit heavy for my daughter. I feel it is even heavy for an audult.
2,Cover started falling off after just one month of indoor play,"I run a competitive church volleyball league on Thursday nights and needed to purchase two quality balls for us to use. We play for 2-3 hours weekly and have some hard spikers in our games. Even still, I was shocked with a brand name like Mikasa to have these start to rip apart the skin in less than a month and just 10 hours of play use. They're good weight and feel, but I feel I got ripped off with the price I paid on these balls. That's too much money to spend if you play a lot."
5,Wheatgrass Growing Trays,I am happy with these. They are what I expectedand are doing just fine for me. I got extra onesto use as lids in the sprouting of my wheatgrass.Works great!
2,Lot's of questions...,"I enjoyed the layout of this book for studying, however I found a bunch of errors in the answers while I was going thru this. Still, as a companion to another book this will at least give you a set of questions and answers that you can study for, just be willing to double check the answers they give you..."
2,Skipped Using This For The Real Exam!,"The questions in this book are so wordy it takes a couple of minutes just to read & re-read one of them. They are very detailed & involved though, in preparing for the exam (I passed with 87%) I skipped using this book because of the time it required. If you are a fast reader go for it, if your a slower reader like me, your better off reading the companion book, i-Net+ Certification Study Guide, again."
3,An adequate supplement to study for exam,Many of the question are worded way too long compared to the actual exam. Does provide some helpful study information while some errors were seen with the answers.
2,Room for improvement,"This book contains many errors. Someone should apologize to Adam Osborne, wherever he is.But it helps to get the mind in ""test mode"" which is a good thing. And you can learn from it."
3,tranny cooler,"For my Application it was exactly what I needed. It Fit well with no problems. I just think that the company producing the item, should provide Additional hose length."
3,For the uninitiated only,"The author conveys his enthusiasm for bike building. He also gets newbies introduced to the basics of a rather simple hobby (once you conquer the art of welding). Other than that I am not fond of this book. It lacks really beneficial tips. If you have space to tear bikes apart and experiment then you will learn everything in this book after only a few projects (and probably lots more). I also don't like how the author is so obsessed with steel bikes. Yes, I know steel is much easier to weld than aluminum, but if you want to create high performance bikes you gotta go aluminum!"
1,better for the welding.,"The author is more welder than bike mechanic, he displays amateur incorrect removal methods for components (like hammering and heating off cranksets and breaking freewheels) where there are inexpensive, time saving and proper removal tools for the job. Inexcusable in the age of the internet. (ironically author lists many websites in back of book, including his own.)The book is just an exercise in pipe-cutting and fitting tubes together to make odd bicycles, (some dangerous and imbalanced) and inexplicably wasn't bothered to be proofread. Bad grammar and incorrect terminology abound. (Stems are not called 'goosenecks' unless you work out of a junkyard.)Author also advocates cutting frames up too much, creating more work than necessary, then welding back together anyway.Very badly thought out, inadequate planning, poor execution.Save your money."
2,Bathroom Material,"It's well written, but the bicycle designs are horrible. I was expecting more of an overview on classic bike building. It's more about taking junk bikes, and turning them into crazy designs that are inferior. This would be great for junior high, or high school kids.Update: Wow, I didn't realize you can leave comments toward a review. This is in response to the negative feedback from the authors: You can't have everyone like your book! I'm sorry if my review hurt your feelings. Next time I need a book on how NOT to design a bike, I'll pull yours from the trash. This just goes to show you that anybody, and I mean anybody can throw together garbage and have it published. A few words to the wise: Next time don't antagonize the reviewers. You were a whole lot better off leaving it at Bathroom Material."
2,Maybe for Sanford and Son,It's a fun book but I had higher expectations hoping it would bring bicycling to the level of Jesse James and choppers. But it's nothing more than welding scrap together.Update: I find it interesting that an author or someone related to the author actually comes to the review pages and tries to argue the reviews. Maybe you should learn from this - it sucks. Ironically you say no one knows how to review yet you have none. I was being nice when I gave it two stars.
4,Practical - Fun - Get Started!,"A very, very, practical approach to diving in and building your own wierd bikes (and I thought I was the only one!) Doesn't assume much of any prior bike knowledge or skill. Also not clouded by any predujice or opinion on one type of biking vs, another - just focused on basic building and fun. Lots of cool projects and ideas - I feel ""scooped"" on a few. Check out the Atomic Zombie site for the latest cool tallbike.Does assume that you have some basic tool and metalworking skills, but still beginner-friendly."
3,Could be useful...,"Covers weird bikes unlikely to be built by the average home builder-some seem to be of the ""circus"" origin. Deals with fabrication using steel bike parts from scrap.Nevertheless, will spark your imagination to create your own. Shows detailed building of a low racer recumbent among other ""designs"".Pictures are small, black & white, however the text is somewhat detailed."
3,"Not Quite as Expected, But Has a Variety of Bikes to Build","This book was only OK, simply put because all the bikes form their website (atomiczombie.com) remain only online and not in this book. The bikes on the website are the eye catching and cool looking ones, and this book does have a few interesting but not very practical bikes to build.I'd think twice about buying this book because unless you have plans to build a skyscraper bike or something that is very non-practical, then you shouldn't get this book. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book for certain people and if you like bizarre and crazy bikes, this is for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest getting a plan from the internet based off their site."
3,Covers the basics that his website doesn't,"The main advantage of this book over his website is that it details pulling old bikes apart for salvaging useful components. For this reason alone it is worth buying to avoid the pitfalls when working things out for yourself. The included plans that are covered are OK for some practice work perhaps, or if you want to build a chopper style bike, but there are more appealing options on the website."
5,Excellent book!,I've been waiting all year for this book to come out ever since Brad posted on his web site that he was working on it. This is the best how-to book I've read. I've already made my own chopper and now working on my own version of the Marauder. I can't believe how many pictures there are! It's a must for everyone who likes to build something different and so easy to follow. Looking forward to their next book on building All-Terrain Robots. Congrats to the authors for a job well done and keep up the great books!
5,"Great book, super step by step instructions.","Just finished reading Atomic Zombie's Bicycle Builder's Bonanza, and loved it. I can't wait for warmer weather to start skoping out bikes to start working on. My boys are reading it and already have their ""wish list"" of favorites that they want to build.Brad did a good job of including all info needed to build the bikes shown. Learning from his experience and mistakes is going to make all it the more enjoyable putting together that first custom bike.Now I want to see a followup book that gives even more plans."
4,"Great Book, lots of fun projects","Really fun book. Full of projects and enough information to get you started on them. My only warning: The book won't really teach you to weld, and you won't be able to do any of the projects if you can't weld."
5,Great fun!,"An ideal introduction to bicycle customization. I'm signed up for a welding class next month, and my first projects will surely come from this book!"
2,Very disappointing,"I was hoping for great things from this book, but as a lot of the other reviewers have said very disappointing. To much time was spent on linux, which if you are going to be building a beowulf you would know, and even if you didn't there is a endless supply of linux knowledge on the net which greatly exceeds what is in this book.At the end of the day I DID build my own low-end beowulf, but sadly I can't say that any of the information that I needed was found in this book. It might have been there but the unorganized layout mad it impossible to find anything."
1,"Useless in 1999, a total waste of money in 2005","As most other readers have elaborated, the book has little or no real substantive material concerning the actual building of a beowulf. Everyone knows Myrinet is better than gigabit ethernet, bu HOW MUCH better for a given class of problems? For any problem???The book does not even consider addressing real issues and configuration choices, but babbles with obvious choices like ssh vs rsh etc, for pages and pages. I feel I was ripped off. These guys seem to be just resting on their laurels and apparently it doesn't seem to bother them that they are giving the intended audience of the book no real value whatsoever. I believe they should either research the matter thoroughly and completely rewrite the book, or just withdraw it from circulation. One can get orders of magnitude more relevant and reliable information just by reading HOWTOs and Googling around.I just wish I had read the other reviews BEFORE buying the book."
2,Not a book you want for building Beowulf.,It is a book about building Beowulf. But many chapters are spent on introducing linux and mpi. You can find more useful information from internet instead of this book.
1,beowulf book aimed at people who know nothing == bad joke,"The other reviewers are right, this is a genuinely pathetic book that you should not even consider buying.This book might be worthwhile if you are starting more or less from scratch and know next to nothing about linux, computers, or networks, but if that's the case your first step should be to hire someone who knows, and they won't want this book. it pontificates in general terms about a number or obvious issues without explaining explicitly how to tackle any of the multitude of configuration issues that come up."
4,Well Researched and Eye Opening,"This interesting book reveals why the gospels were written the way they were. It explains the reasons the authors of the New Testament conflicted with each other, maintaining that each author (or group of authors) represented a different branch of Christianity at a different time, and therefore each author changed and invented narratives to promote their particular sect's beliefs. Really interesting book about how we got the bible. My only complaint was that there was a lot of repetition, which made the book difficult to get through. The author made his point, and then the rest of the book was evidence for it, and the evidence all ran together after a while. Good information though."
4,A Dubious Disciple Book Review,"Helms begins his book by claiming that he writes as a literary critic of the four Gospels, not as a debunker ... then he proceeds with a thorough debunking.This is a good mix of original ideas and established scholarship. Helms' message is clear: that the Gospels are artful, fictional variations of a common theme, individualized by each author's motives. He treats separately the birth narratives, miracles, passion story, and resurrection appearances, showing how each is often related to the Old Testament in order to lend artificial authority, or derived from pagan myths or contemporary miracle claims.I found the book thought-provoking, though a little disturbing in tone. It's short, not meant to be an in-depth study. Recommended as a starting point for research in the development of the Gospels."
4,A clear critique of the historical validity of the Gospels,"This book, valuable to the informal reader as well as the researcher, highlights the (seemingly intentionally) embellished nature of the New Testament, and notes the unconvincing arguments of Gospel defenders. With clear and convincing reasoning he exposes various discrepancies in the gospels, indicating how history was exaggerated to satisfy prophecies. Writing as literary critic the author does not pick an argument with the Christian faith and acknowledges the value of the Gospels as works of art, but strips the religious baggage from the New Testament books. Chapters address the fictional nature of theology, nativity legends, miracles, passion narratives and resurrection accounts. The book's non-emotional style shouldn't offend the believer who is brave enough to question dogma, yet the well-researched and uncompromising text should arm the skeptic with large-bore ammunition in arguing with Bible-defenders,"
2,Bleeeecch!!!,"A friend recommended this book to me. It was not until later that I discovered he had the author confused with someone else. What bad writing! The positive reviews here show me that either fantasy is in a worse state than I realized, or people are just not demanding enough of their authors. I find Ms. Douglass to be somewhat more competent here than she was in her awful Wayfarers Redemption, but that's not saying much. The second star is for what I grudgingly admit is an original take on a standard plot, but the writing itself is so bad that it makes the teeth hurt."
4,"Great, then fell off","The first 2/3 of Threshold are wonderful. The progression is unstoppable, the evil is encroaching, and the author creates a great sense of horror building up to a climactic scene. Then the tension just disappears. The solution isn't as hard as it should be, and the emotional involvement the author built in the first part just fizzles. It's still worth reading, but the end was a serious disappointment."
4,This is a great read,This is a great read- it is enjoyable and quite diverting. The characters were well drawn out and the plot interesting and an interesting twist on several classic fantasy themes...Ms. Douglass writes clearly and has a way of drawing the reader into the story so much so that it keeps one turning the pages to find out what happens next.I highly reccomend it.
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book, but it was not my favourite of Sara Douglass'. I really liked The Troy Game, especially the second book in the series. This book started better than it ended, though. I felt it got a little dull more than half the way through, and I wasn't so keen on the ending. I think it didn't completely live up to my expectations because the last part of the book wasn't quite as strong, in my opinion. The first half was very engaging. Still a good read."
5,You won't be able to keep these love stories to yourself!,"You will want to pick up several copies of this endearing and thoughtfully compiled book of love stories. After reading several of the excerpts you will be compelled to call your friends and share the stories or give them their own copy to read. Each story has been carefully categorized throughout the book so as to take you through a myriad of emotions. You will laugh, cry and laugh again. You won't be able to put the book down. If you consider yourself a romantic this book is definitely for you. If you've never thought of yourself as a romantic you are about to be converted!"
4,"Love Is All Ye, you Need","Great book. Sentimental love stories - some with a humorous touch! If you LOVE love, you'll love this book. It's Never too late - there's even an 80+ first-time bride! Funny wedding stories, unique proposals - also explores the difficult times in marriage but one thing's for sure - DON'T GIVE UP! Hang in there. How nice to read something positive about love, marriage and relationships for a change!"
4,A great band from Rochester New York!,This CD captures a lot of the magic of Cabo Frio--but they were even better live! I saw this band many times in Syracuse and Rochester between 1982-1985 and they never failed to disappoint! Grab a copy of this or their prior CD Just Having Fun if you can find them...
5,Excellent CD and DVD labels,"These labels worked very well, but what makes this a 5-star is the software from Memorex that makes it easy to set the titles and import pictures. They also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts."
2,Questionable Material Quality for DVD Labels,"I have been using the more expensive Memorex polyester DVD labels for a while now and have been very happy so far. The yellow banner packages promote the benefits of polyester over paper and I believe them. However I just received my order for more of the DVD labels, and the new packaging has the same bar code nunmber, but nowhere does it say the word ""polyester"", and in fact it states very clearly ""White Matte Paper"" labels. This is a warning to anyone considering buying the ""Special"" DVD labels. They may not be what they seem."
1,Package contains wrong product,"DVD labels are supposed to be made of polyester material. This package contains paper labels, not usable on DVD's ."
1,Do not buy these from Adorama Camera,"I bought these from Adorama Camera and they send me something completely different. They send me PAPER labels and not the polyester ones listed. It was not the same packaging or the same item. I notice some other people complained about this as well, so I bet they also bought them from Adorama Camera.If the packaging is not exactly like the one listed, they are not polyester or heat resistant. The polyester labels like the ones listed are wonderful, but make sure to contact the seller to verify they are the exact product listed before buying."
5,Big bang for you money,"Memorex DVD label ordered through Amazon is a great deal, at a decent if not excellent quality. I am a video editor, and I use these kinds of label from time to time. I used to get this from either Office Depot or Office Max or Fries at a price that reap me off ($20 per 20 label set). Since I searched online, I found Amazon offer at half the price, and I am really happy to operate at half the cost now.Memorex DVD label is a fabric type that adhere to your disk more evenly and smoothly, and more durable than the paper type. It is not an ideal label for DVD, but for at home and amateur like me, it is sufficient. The quality is not bad. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I would grade Memorex DVD label at an 8. Of course there are other professional type of label or imprint out there. But the cost might make you hesitate for a moment if your volume production is low. Any way good luck on your purchase."
1,Memorex Labels have gone cheap,We've bought these labels for years for our in home business and our last purchase of labels are garbage. They are so thin that when you try to stomp the label on the disc the label bubbles.DO NOT BUY MEMOREX LABELS
3,Not a great product,"These labels are not that great. They don't give you any info on what kind of paper to set the printer for, and with NERO the label is a little off center. The only thing they have going for them is the fact that after you compensate for the image being off center they are easier to get from printer to DVD case. If you just do one or two at a time I suggest printing on good quality printer paper and cutting them out yourself. They are very expensive for what you get."
5,Great Label,"After reading the one review on this site, I was afraid to buy the label but it was the only one I could find at a reasonable price that was specifically for DVDs. We just purchased enough for the one project we were doing at the time. We didn't have any problems with the labels at all. They peeled off the paper backing smoothly, they went on the applicator well, and had absolutely no bubbles when placed on the DVD. I'm not sure what went wrong with the other reviewer's task, but we think these are very nice labels."
2,DVDs just arn't meant to be labelled I guess,"My paper labels warp my DVDs, so I had to try something new. I went with these guaranteed safe for DVD labels. I haven't had any warping problems, but using the Memorex label applicator, I get a very high percentage of DVDs with air bubbles. It's just so annoying. I think I'm going to have to switch again to a DVD printer and printable discs for custom labeling.In addition, using the Xerox Phaser laser printer, the print rubbed off. On my $25 inkjet, the ink stayed.Update 09-14-08: One of my recent customers (past 4 months) has contacted me saying their DVDs are now skipping. I expect this is due to the labels. I will never label another DVD again with adhesive; it just isn't working for me."
4,"Does The Job, But Too Expensive","A great number of devices can read discs just fine. However, there are a few devices that I use that are more sensitive. For these devices there is a great improvement. (If you backup your xbox 360 games, you need this)I've noticed that when discs with labels get extremely hot several times they can lift off the disc a little bit. I've yet to have one of these discs do that.My one complaint about these labels is the insane price! These labels are easily 30 times the cost of traditional paper labels."
1,"Everybody knows Lewis, nobody knows Beversluis.","Eerdmans has obviously hit the skids in its publishing projects. What are they going to publish next? The memoirs of Mr. Nobody? I won't bother to refute Beversluis's numerous ad hominem, post hoc propter hoc, argument from authority, straw man, and other informal logical fallacies. Every country is familiar with C S Lewis and his books are being published and sold in huge quantities to this day. But very few people, except for some small number of about twenty or so weirdos, know who John Beversluis is. I found this book in a used book store, about twenty years old yet in perfect condition as if no one read it. I can see why. At first you think it is a commentary on C S Lewis. Then you discover it is written by some jealous weirdo from Syracuse University who unleashes his religious hangups."
5,"Michael ""Jeep"" Willis lost and found","This has to be one of the greatest records of all time. The guitar playing is phenomenal. Just a couple of days ago I found out that Michael ""Jeep"" Willis is in reality Timo Laine, who has several records (does that term date me?) out including Symphonic Slam."
