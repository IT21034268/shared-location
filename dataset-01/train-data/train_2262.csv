5,Excellent,"I have been more than pleased with this product, the price on this product, and the speed of delivery."
5,Very good results,I purchased this item to upgrade a friend's PC. My friend was impressed with the increased performation of her PC. I recommend this memory to upgrade any HP PC which can use this memory.
4,crucial to performance,"about a month into using the 1gb pair (2x1gb) and all is well. very notable improvement in pc speed and processing from original 1gb. gateway laptop running windows vista. vista seems quite problematic and additional ram is essential. freezing, slow loading, constant need to reboot for the most part gone. crucial installed very easily with 200 pin and correct slot location. computer recognized ram and off we went. 4 stars since only installed for short time."
5,Works for 1st Generation White Macbook,I got this to upgrade a first generation White Macbook. Installation was simple and the chips were recognized. The Macbook (now running Leopard) has noticeable less lag in running apps.
5,Amazon Does It Again!,"Ordered this when it was $20 more on other sites. Received in less than two days, installed and works great! Once again, Amazon is the place to buy!"
5,Laptop speed booster for Vista,Upgraded a low end HP/Compaq laptop running MS Vista from 1GB to 2GB. There was a very noticable increase in graphics and program execution speed. At $42 this was an exceptional value for a very high quality product.
1,Crucial incompatability,This memory was recommended by Crucial as being compatable with my MSI motherboard and was not.
2,1 gig goes bad,"I purchased two 1 gig mem sticks. I had no problem with installation, and I am no expert. After 4 months my computer stopped starting. I took the computer to an Appel store. they determined that one of the memory sticks has gone bad and is preventing the computer to re-start. it was removed and all is well now, less 1 gig I paid for."
5,New Life for my laptop,"My 6 year old Gateway laptop is ""YOUNG"" again!! Ten minutes after recieving these new memory cards, they were installed and the laptop responded as if it was a new machine... GREAT product, and I avoided the high cost of replacing the laptop..."
4,great product,love this product it works great and my computer is so much faster after i installed it
3,good memory ... i guess,"easy to install and shipping was quick. im not sure if it made any impact on the speed of my computer, it doesn't seem to crash when i have too many windows open anymore. at least it was under $20"
5,As expected,Added to an old Inspiron 1501 runinng vista. Made a almost useless system run like better than new. Shipping was very quick and was packaged new. A must if u have a old 1501 collecting dust that u would like to revive. This is the max ram this laptop will use.
3,Ok,I was expecting 2GB Crucial but a different brand was in the package. I used them anyway and my mom laptops is now fast.
3,Hasn't performed miracles!,"I ordered this for my MacBook Pro which I purchased in mid-2006. I found that it did speed up my computer a bit. However, just yesterday, when I tried to quit Safari, I got that rolling pinwheel and thought, uh oh, this is not a miracle worker."
3,Speed not registering as advertised.,"The speed of this RAM is not as advertised. My computer is only reading 553mhz for speed and this is my second set too. Works good, just the speed isn't as advertised. Maybe my motherboard can only pick up 553mhz for max speed, not sure?"
5,Good upgrade for old computer,Easy installation to upgrade my old Dell Inspiron. Computer is now quicker and flashier but as expected going from 1 to 2 GB isn't a huge difference.
5,Made my Mac Mini usable,"I bought this to take my Mac Mini to 2 GB from 1. Went right in, recognized fine and now I'm surfing with ease. I can actually do more than one thing at a time now. Where the Mini used to pause and hiccup, it's now smooth as buttah.Perfect."
3,mediocre results from memory increase,"I upgraded the standard 1GB factory installed memory in my HP notebook withCrucial 2Gb. The results are not really crucial or noticeable.I assume that under some conditions it will perform better,but it's not a clear advantage."
4,Reasonable,"Its just what you expect. My Vista was grinding my hard drive too much with just 1 GB on my HP Pavilion. I upgraded to 2GB with Crucial. The installation was quick and painless. The price is reasonable, though you can find it at a similar price in a regular store as well. Since I was ordering another item I didn't had to pay shipping, otherwise I would have waited longer. Before ordering I made sure this was the exact item I needed. Everything works just fine and I am not rebooting my system when Firefox is consuming 1GB of RAM. It arrived without delay."
4,Easy/cheap RAM for my MACBOOK,Purchase crucial RAM for my MACBOOK. Delivery was as scheduled. Installation was easy as expected. No surprises. Works great!
5,Crucial 2GB 667MHz RAM,Easy installation into mhy laptop even though I had never opened a laptop until now. This Crucial memory holds up to the Crucial reputation for being the best. If you need more memory for your laptop and can use the 2GB set this is the one to get.
5,Improved RAM,"I was very satisfied with the Crucial 2GB Set. I was pleased with the quick arrival, easy video instructions on their website for installation and the ease of installation. My laptop was smokin' after the installation!"
5,works perfectly!!!,Bought this to upgrade my sony vaio vgn-250e from 1GHz to 2GHz. The upgrade was smooth and encounted no problems. My computer is now much faster.
5,Finally my hp laptop is usable again..,I received this product four days after ordering it. Went on to youtube and was able to watch a video of how to replace the ram on my hp dv6000 pc. This 2 one 1gb ram worked as advertise. My laptop is now running as it did 5 years ago.
4,Good Product Poor SHipping Service,I was very satisfied with my purchase. VERY DISAPPOINTED with how long it took to be sent to me. I checked the progress of the shipping daily and it seriously took 9 days for this package to travel less than 20 miles to my house. It would have been faster if I just drove there and picked it up from the facility myself!!!!! Never have I been so disappointed shopping on Amazon!!!!!!
4,Nice Ram,"Ordered for a Lenovo 3000 c200, Works really well with a noticeable jump in speed. I will order again."
5,Good shop,"Although I didn't knew the Crucial brand, I tried to buy the set with 2 X 1Gb memory. It is working great, very good performance indeed!"
1,Not worth the price of a paperback,"There's usually enough intrigue packed into a Katherine Stone novel to outshine many other authors in this genre. Not this one. A draining, emotionally overwrought storyline. One dimensional characters. Leaves the pulse flatlined. Miracle menses and conception just in time for holiday publication (what more do you need to know?) File this one under inspirational, NOT contemporary romance. Hopefully, this was just Ms. Stone's opportunity to make a quick holiday buck and she'll be back on track to satisfy her readers soon."
4,Entertaining....,"Midnight Clear was an entertaining story, it was a background filler for me as I read Island of Dreams first, which ties characters in from Midnight Clear. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful story of overcoming past pain and embracing the gifts we are given. I couldn't put the book down my whole flight despite the conversation and noisy kids around me."
1,Disappointment,"I usually enjoy this author's books, however A Midnight Clear is nothing but schmaltz. The story is a bit unbelievable and slow moving."
3,Typical Katherine Stone read,"This is one of K Stone's shortest books that I have ever read. Is she just out to make a quick buck over the holiday season? Personally, I think the story was quite hard to believe - Jace can still operate with his fingers all broken and returns just in time to find he has a brand new child. This story pushes it to the limits. Maybe it's so magical just so people can believe in love again. I gave it 3 stars as K Stone's prose-like style is still very refreshing. If this was the first Stone book that you've read, try Illusions, Roommates or Rainbows for stories with lots of plot twists, character development and settings."
4,Good Story...But Not Plausible,"I don't believe for a minute that a sensible mother with a young daughter would invite a teenage boy, a COMPLETE STRANGER, to live in her home unless she REALLY knew him well.A lot about this book was not believable but that didn't prevent it from being enjoyable.KS's characters (in all her books) are always complex, compassionate, intelligent ... and troubled. In this, she is unbeatable. No one else gives as much depth to fictional characters.I do wish Jace and Julia's love life would have been a little more detailed, however.And (the reason for 4 stars), I wish KS wouldn't make those characters recovering from illness or accident SO sickly looking. I get it that they've been ill, I don't need it that explicit to where the characters look ""skeletal"" or have ""paper thin skin"", that sort of thing."
4,Playboy Girls of Mardi Gras,"They picked a few amateurs off the streets, but they did have a few regulars, such as Katalina Verdin, who looked hot. Others include Theresa Politi. The hottest girl, in my opinion, was Gigi Saint Blaque. She was picked off the streets and is the girl who acted like a mannequin. Very hot chick."
1,disappeared?,"this arrived, was wrong size, i sent it back and 'poof' haven't heard anything since. no money back, no mattress cover... nada"
1,Please read this... before buying...,"I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board. Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months. Please save yourself money and grief and get another board."
1,Not worth it. Don't buy it. Unless you want it.,"Our toddler hates it. It makes the stroller awkward. The straps are permanent, so you can't use it on another stroller. It's too expensive. It was a waste of our money. But hey, you may love it, some people apparently do, that's why we bought it. Didn't work for us, however. Good luck."
1,Crushed,TO my surprise the garlic press snapped in two on the third use. Unfortunately it took me too long to figure out how to return it. I don't lift weights and it was a little early early for metal fatigue.
1,Broke within a month,"Even though I always peeled the cloves, this press didn't do a good job fully pressing the garlic. And then, after only a few weeks, it snapped in two as I was pressing a clove - avoid this one!"
1,"looks good, doesn't perform","I was fooled by the Italian name and sturdy appearance. It only works if you peel your garlic first, which for me defeats the purpose of a garlic press - if I'm going to get messy peeling the garlic I might as well just chop it with a knife at that point. I think the angle of the handle has something to do with it not providing enough leverage to squeeze the garlic out. I'm now looking for another garlic press..."
1,Pedrini Ergo Garlic Press,Leornardo Da Vinci would have cried. The thing is made of pot iron and broke into two pieces the very first time it was used to press a clove of garlic. The person using the device was not a 900 lb gorilla but my little 115 lb anemic wife.
1,Didn't work for me either,"I had one of these once and had the same problem of the pieces not fitting together....Despite it's looks, it was terrible....I returned mine..."
1,"Disappointing, barely adequate","I was SO excited to be getting a new garlic press after my el cheapo gave up the ghost. But from the first clove, this press has been a let-down. While I LOVE the self-cleaning feature (a coveted feature that drove my shopping and may have eliminated better choices) and the large chamber, I am disappointed that this press doesn't fully close to crush the clove through the li'l holes. Barely any garlic comes out and I find myself mincing the crushed (almost-entire) clove that's left in the chamber."
1,"Don't waste your money-Looks Cool, but lousy handle design","The cool looking plastic inserts came out the day I pulled it out of the package..No Way am I going to be digging the gadget drawer trying to find the plastic handle thingies.. without them there are tabs that poke..Piece of junk, I should have known that when it came shrink wrapped in plastic shell and I couldn't touch it before purchase. Manufacturer probably had the inserts falling out in shipment so they came up with the brilliant idea."
2,OK but not Great,"This is a good garlic press, it cleans easily, it looks nice, and it is comfortable. However, the pieces do not fit together tightly. This is a problem because the garlic spills up the sides and out the top. Also the press does not always fully crush garlic. The pieces do not completely go together because the handles bend so that they are touching, but the crusher does not completely close. The joint holding the pieces together is not very tight and it allows the pieces to not line up properly also contributing to the problem of not fully crushed garlic. This is a better garlic crusher than my previous $1.50 press... but it is not worth the price and there are probably better ones. I have used the Good Grips press and liked it, but read the reviews that said it broke, so I tried this one. Bad idea."
1,I not good. I took mine back.,This thing just does not work--straight up. I sqeezed and squeezed and nothing came out. Even though I peeled the clove. I took mine back.Get the Zyliss (available from Amazon). This is one of the best gadgets/tools I've ever used. The garlic flies out of the press in a satisfying burst. And it's easy to clean.
4,It might say for kids... but it worked great,I wanted a coat rack for my shared cubicle space. I saw this and bought it with 1-click before seeing it was for kids. It turned out to be great though. Not as tall as I would have liked; but my colleagues and I had no problem hanging all four of our coats from it. It was extremely easy to put together too. All the necessary hardware and tools (one screw and one allen wrench) came with. I had it out of the box and assembled in about two minutes.
4,Not your same old Lynley,"A gripping story of deceit and misunderstanding, resulting in murder and tragedy. If you know Elizabeth George, then you will want to read this book. If you don't, it is a good introduction to her uncommon skills."
1,Disappointing,We ordered this ball and had to return it as it was defected and would not hold air. Perhaps the next time we order a product like this it will not be defected.
1,"If you enjoy feeling inept in math, this is the book for you",I just completed test #3 of 6 that are in the book and once again I feel like I don't know a thing about math after studying for the past 2 and a half months for an hour or two a day. There are questions that are asked on the test based on material that you usually don't see until grad school.A total waste of time and negative emotion.
3,"Nice book, but no updates","This books gives you a clear understanding abour Sub GRE topics, especially if you are non math grad and want to take test. Half of the book reviews fundamental topics which are going to be tested in test.6 exercises although they are not same as original test, gives you good practice, few problems are harder than the original GRE, but they gives you good grip over subject.But the recent edition was published in 99, yet no other upgrades, test is rescaled in 01.I suggest this book to all test takers."
2,"good review, bad practice","All in all the product was a decent review of the math covered by the GRE math subject test, but the format of the practice tests is not at all in line with the version that ETS has on their website. As far as I can tell, ETS doesn't ask you ugly computational problems which is all these tests are. Use the review section to remind yourself of the most prevalent theorems and do some of the test problems to review the computations. But don't use your results from these practice tests to make any prediction about your real score on test day. There is no way ETS would expect you to finish a test of this style in under 3 hours. That would just not be feasible."
3,Not Quite for the GRE,"This book is excellent; but at a level above what you need for the GRE. The first grouping of this book is a general review of everything you could possibly see, the second is 6 practice tests. I found the review to be better as a ""guide"" to your own studying; seeing what topics they cover, then doing more detailed work on each topic apart from the book. The tests are harder than the GRE, and I find them better for practice for Candidacy Exams than for the GRE. My advice: Don't buy this book. Instead, save your money and time, and just cover notes from past math classes."
1,A terrible book,"Under no circumstances should you buy this book. It has major flaws:1) The material covered does not seem to match what is actually on the test.2) The mathematics is full of typographical errors; as a result many of the problems are incomprehensible.3) Some of the solutions are ridiculous, incoherent nonsense.A much better book is ""Cracking the GRE Math Test"" by Leduc"
3,A Decent Preparation for the Math GRE,"This book contains a few hundred pages of math review, six practice exams, and explanations for all the exam answers. Although the content of the exams is close to the actual Math GRE, the ""spirit"" of the questions is quite different, and the way problems are worked in the explanations is often not the best way to solve problems from the actual GRE. The review section also has some problems--typos, too many elementary topics, and sketchy explanations of complex topics. Still, it makes an okay review, and could help greatly if you're rusty at math."
3,I found myself pounding my head after an hour.,"I bought this book because of the 6 practice exams. However, after trying the first practice exam, I found myself digging out all my college mathematics books. It was getting ridiculous, and I'm glad that several other reviewers agree that the practices exams in this book is harder than the actual exam. I suppose it would be good practice, so I will keep the book; but I will be purchasing Princeton Review's test prep to prepare for this exam."
2,Poorly proofread,"The level of difficulty and depth of the questions in this book is generally much higher than the real exam. While studying questions that are modestly harder than the actual test is often a good way to score high, this book goes well beyond that level, to the point of being almost useless.The proofreading of this book is remarkably poor. Several problems have incorrect solutions. Such inaccuracies (as well as many typos) leave a reader wondering whether any of the content can be trusted.The typesetting is also very poor. While this is primarily a cosmetic issue, in some places it makes the content less comprehensible."
2,Letdown...,"There was a lot of hype surrounding this book. I was let down by the actual product. People were misidentified, names were spelled incorrectly and dates were noticably wrong. All of this from someone who was supposedly in the know. I will not buy any of her other books, for fear of being let down again."
5,Wonderful Pictures!!!,"Yes, this is coming from a die hard June fan.Hi there! I can't tell you how many times throughout the week I look at this book. It's wonderful!! It shows many great pictures with a long caption underneath it. I ahve not read any of Peggy's other books, but they are probably as good as this one!!June"
5,GET THIS POT,"love it, other reveiws complained about pin holes in finish mine was in perfect condition when i bought it. use at least once a week. the heat distribution is excelent. very durable... products from le creuset a must have!!!!!!!! for any one who loves to cook like myself."
3,Not the usual Le Creuset,"I have had the same experience with this piece that others have--I had to return it because of the cast iron showing through in several spots. I exchanged it for another one, which is much better--just short of being perfect, so good enough to keep this time. In general, I highly recommend Le Creuset--the other items I have (most purchased through Amazon) are just wonderful, but I do have reservations recommending this particular item. The customer service from Amazon in regard to the return was impeccable!"
1,bad shape,I bought this and ended up returning. It has a very small bottom. I would have liked to brown ingredients first and then add rest and bake. It is just a poor design. Doesn't live up to the wonderful quality that le creuset has.
3,Details-no-----pictures--yes,"I have been interested in owning a chin for a couple of years, but the lack of info has kept me from doing so. I saw on a documentary that these dogs can get very depressed and have desperately be trying to find out if this is true. The answer was not in this book. This book is very general in info--it could be applied to any dog--it goes into housebreaking and safety tips which is fine, but I wanted more info on a chin itself. Overall it is an ok book. If anyone has a book that goes into more depth of the chin, I would be interested in buying one at a reasonable price."
4,Informative and helpful!,"There is very little written about this curious but delightful breed of dogs. This book definately is written by a Japanese Chin lover and describes the breed and care of, in an interesting and helpful manner. It discusses the breed's origins, characteristics, and care for in easy to follow chapters. The photographs seem repetitive using bland color backgrounds and facial closeups. I was a bit disappointed that much of the book was dedicated to advertising products. Overall, this is a great guide for owners or prospective owners of Japanese Chins."
1,Bad product for your dollar....,"...This particular item was something my wife bought a while back and it fell apart with-in 3 days. The Rubber ""Grip-EZ"" handle started to peel off and the actual steel would start to peel off as well.If you haven't much money and wish to blow it on more expensive yet lower quality kitchen utensils I fell this particular product and anything really the NORPRO brand sells is right up your alleyCru"
1,Worst Ever!,Don't waste your money on this or any Sherry Garrett plays. Terrible audio and video. All the scenes seem as though they were taped using a very cheap camcorder. I'm very surprise beautiful Lisa Raye participated in this crap. The DVD simply isn't worth a nickel!.
1,It's a shame,"The main reason I bought this was to see fine Bernadette Stanis. I at least thought I'd be able to hear it. They should have just scrapped this. Please don't waste your money. It's not worth it. Well, if maybe just to see Bernadette!"
1,Pictures are suspect,A lot of the pictures in this book appear to be digitally enhanced. Flower edges are blurred and blooms seem to float uniformly over masses of green. Where is the imagination in that? I can photoshop a garden and copy the same flower over and over too.
4,A charming tale of exponential growth,"Excellent!This book is such a simple variation on the old grains on a chessboard example of exponential growth. The story is charming, but not exceptional. It is the almost familiar story of a peasant who wishes to marry the princess and uses his brain to achieve his goal.I'd recommend it to anyone with bright young children or grandchildren to read it to. And you are bound to enjoy it yourself too."
5,Comfortable Composing,"While I served in the military, physicians determined that I had arthritis. Since it only bothered my major joints, such as my knees, and since the prescribed treatments relieved the symptoms, I really paid little attention to the condition. Unfortunately, after I retired from the military the arthritis settled into my fingers.For me, the most irritating problem with arthritis in my hands is with my writing. I had used ballpoint pens comfortably and with ease. Now, with my grip I am unable to control the pen, and my penmanship which was always sloppy became unreadable, even to me.Pilot Dr. Grip is a wonderful solution. First the barrel is fatter so I do not lose the pen. Second, the barrel has a non slip surface which keeps the pen in my control. Since the barrel is larger it is much more comfortable than other pens I have tried.I highly recommend the Pilot Dr. Grip."
5,Best Pen ever!,"I LOVE these pens. The only complaint I have is that they will smudge if you touch the ink soon after writing. However, that is the case with most any pen of this type, so it isn't much of a complaint. Great pen!"
1,Lots of smudges,I don't know if this is necessarily the fault of this pen or all Pilot products with the G2 gel ink but this ink smudges terribly - it ends up all over my hand where it crosses the page - and it skips sometimes. The pen itself was perfectly comfortable but I ended up returning it after one use because of the smudging.
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to hear of this work, even knowing of the omissions mentioned by other reviewers. When I got the book, I found it to be full of errors, most notably in the section on naval officers. These errors range from the typographical (inconsistent use of italics, spelling errors, etc.) to the factual (incorrect promotion dates/assignments). The appendices at the end also have errors. For example, the appendix on ""flag officers who died in WWII"" omits at least two admirals, including one whose death is mentioned in his entry in the body of the book. I understand that with so many entries mistakes will slip through even the most careful editing, but the number of errors indicates the editing apparently wasn't all that careful, in my opinion. Use caution if this is your only source on a particular officer."
2,This edition is flawed.,"This edition has a number of useful introductions, backgrounds, and footnotes. The text itself is flawed. There are misspellings on almost every page, and the scripture references are mistyped or mismatched. There is no table of contents and no way to easily navigate through the book."
3,Dissapointing,"I got this for free from another site, so I can't complain about the price. I have to say that this was a pretty disappointing narration of The Pilgrim's Progress. This is a book that I think would have been best read by a male voice, such as Simon Vance or Nick Cordileone (who've both done work for this same publisher).I would recommend the version done by Max McLean."
5,Fantastic Watertable,"My daughter is only 18 months old and she loves playing in the watertable. We use puffed rice and sometimes water in one of the sides in the table due to her eating everything while she is teething. We use it in the kitchen so she has something to do while I am preparing food. It keeps her entertained and is perfect height since she is only 30 inches tall. She can take the lid off by herself and start playing in it on her own. Being a toddler teacher, I had to search around until I found the appropriate one. I also liked that it has the drain plugs."
5,the wrath of khan!,"i love this album. period. late 70's fusion jazz rock at it's finest and with Steve Gadd on drums you can't go wrong. this album is rich with supersonic melodies, a nice selection of different groove flavors. Steve Khans guitar playing is perfect and i love that 70's studio sound, his note selection is perfect and gives way to the imagination on every song. you just don't hear music like this anymore, i cherish this cd and i want to go back any re-buy his album ""tight rope"" which i had on vinyl when i was a kid."
5,Benchmark Guitar Fusion,"I had the vinyl. I wore it out. This album came out when I lived for ""Jazz Fusion"". The icons of the day were Weather Report, Return to Forever, The Jeff Lorber Fusion, et al. WRVR was alive and well in NYC and voices like this had an outlet. This album was one of my favorites and I will never tire of it. The rhythm section alone is worth the price of admission. Steve's composition is wonderful and the contributions of his supporting cast are stellar. His playing is inspired and furious. Thoughtful and moving. The depth and transparency of the mixes were, (are) a revelation. If you need a window in time to understand what this stylistic world of music was all about, open the shades and buy it. While you are at it add ""Tightrope"" and the rare and pricey these days ""Arrows"" to complete the picture. If you want to hear the elite NYC session cats of the day rockin' in musical fellowship it's hard to go wrong with this one."
2,nothing to write home about,"These mice have sat in the cat toy box and did not inspire any play in my cats, they are seniors though and prefer more interactive type toys."
3,Black fountain-pen ink; not for checks,"This ink is OK on bad paper, but test your paper for two-sided writing with this ink. If these cartridges do not say ""SLOVENIA"" on them, they have Sheaffer's old ink formula, a ""medium"" black color. If these cartridges say ""SLOVENIA"" on them, they have the new formula, which is an improved, ""medium-dark"" black color. It is water-resistant enough for addresses on envelopes and package labels, but not safe for writing checks. It is popular with fountain-pen enthusiasts."
5,SHEAFFER PEN JET BLACK INK CARTRIDGE 5PK,Great refills for my pen. The color is brilliant and i've had no issues with these cartridges. An even $5.00 price would be better; but quality sometimes comes at a price. But I can't complain and I have to say I'm satisfied with this product.
2,This film was a tremendous disappointment -- very much unlike other films released by the Cirque Du Soleil.,I'm sure that I won't waste my time to watch this film again. It is noisy and not very artistic!
2,OK,"It is clear that not much thought was put into staging this outdoor performance. Instead of such DVD releases, it would be wiser for Cirque du Soleil to release the show, ""Mystère,"" on DVD in order to bring back the Cirque magic to our TV screens."
4,can send it in india,"Dear Sir,can u send your product (Panasonic PV-GS83 MiniDV Camcorder) in india. I will pay extra for courier serivices"
2,Not Worth the High Price Tag,"There are some good songs on this set but not enough to make it worth the money. I think it would be better to save your money and buy a cheaper oldies set that has more popular songs. A lot of these were unfamiliar to me. One good point is that these are all original recordings, but there were only about 20 good songs."
2,From a Rock and Roll Fuddy Duddy,"I bought one of these for a Christmas present for my brother and one for me. We're both connoiseurs of this music.When all was said and done, there is most certainly some good stuff here, and it's fairly representative of that era. But quite frankly, there are way too many 2nd and 3rd rate cuts included to make this set worth owning.I played mine so few times that I don't even know where it is any more. I'm especially sorry I gave one to my brother for Christmas. He deserved better."
5,Just A Delight,"My 19-month-old granddaughter's name is not Josie but she is simply delighted by this book! I think all children love to play hide and seek and can relate to Josie's glee at hiding from her family. Her favorite part is when she is finally found and nestled close to all her family. It is a real ""FEEL GOOD"" read."
4,Overall happy with purchase,"I've been looking to buy this set for my husband for a while now. I feel it was a good value, I shopped around a lot. Would recommend."
4,El principio de dilbert,"Uno de los primeros libros de Scott Adams, protagonizado por sus miticos Dilbert, Dogbert, y cia.una vez más nos ilustra con divertidas tiras comicas, que escenifica de forma ironica, aquellas situaciones que todos y de algún modo podemos vivir en la oficina, comportamientos de los compañeros de trabajo, las neuras del jefe, sistemas de trabajo anacrónicos, paradojas de los negocios, etc...También ilustra escenas de la vida privada de Dogbert y Dilbert en su casa.Es muy rápido de leer y hace reflexionar sobre pequeños detalles de la cotidaniedad de nuestro trabajo de oficina."
2,i love lucy wall clock,"as a wall decoration, it's great. but as a clock it's not. the hands are a pale color and are difficult to see and it's about 90 minutes slow even after a new battery. no warranty or instructions. i should have paid attention to who the seller was."
2,Did Not Like,"I did not understand these people at all. Tanner was OK, in fact he seemed really devoted. The question is..WHY? Gwyneth was a pain. She had SO much baggage from the past; an assault, a rough father who treated her like a boy, no mother, a shy and insecure personality...etc...but I still couldn't figure out why she acted in the ways she did. As a reader, I like to be able to connect to and follow the characters, and I couldn't with this book. (and didn't really want too) THEN there was that ""Womens Council"" stuff and their ""Rules for Bride Courting"". Ridiculous! Sounds like ""Stepford Men"" to me. This ""Freedom Valley"" bunch is definitely NOT for me. KCS"
5,A serious look at swinging,"The subject is, on the surface, swinging - sharing sexual partners. A closer look shows that the subject is the dynamics of close relationships. There is much written about the subject of relationships, so, you may ask why I think swingers have something to say? My answer is that swingers removed the taboos and discarded the 'already known facts' before examining the subject.The book is not, I say, a definitive work. It is more of an investigation. It is far more complete, accurate, unbiased, thoughtful, and provocative than anything else I have seen on the subject. It will be quite valuable to anybody who reads it. I do not mean that whoever reads this book will see that swinging is the way to go - not at all. You don't have to be a swinger to benefit from what swingers have learned just as you don't have to be an astronomer to benefit from what astronomers know."
2,Not what I needed...This reads like a history book and,"I was looking for more info on the emotional and psychological impact. I also didn't see enough negative information; in other words, I don't think ANY of the books I've read on swinging are properly balanced with both positive and negative feedback from participants."
3,Great intro to Lifestyle,"This is a good book for those that are looking to learn the difference between lifestyle and swinger. This book will provide the inside to the lifestyle world that shows one can be a lifestyle person and yet have no intercourse with anyone. It's not all about sex, but rather meeting people with the same interest as you and a controlled and fun environment."
5,A Review From a Hamster Obsessed Girl,"This book is really good! It is about a hamster named Freddy, who goes through many adventures! Freddy is an unusual hamster who can actually read and write! He has lots of friends. Enrico and Caruso are his friend guinea pigs, that make poems and can get on his nerves a lot, but he still can consider them friends. Sir William is his cat friend, a civilized cat who wont eat Freddy. Also, there is Mr. John and Sophie. Little Sophie was his original owner, and he always watched her do her schoolwork so he could learn how to read, but then her mom had an allergy to hamsters, so he had to live at Mr. John's. Mr. John has a computer that he can write his stories on. ""I, Freddy"" is a really great book, and if you read this one, you will want to read his other books: ""Freddy in Peril"", ""Freddy to the Rescue"", and ""The Haunting of Freddy"". I hope they come out with more soon!"
4,"I, Freddy","This is a great book about a hamster named Freddy. Freddy wants to learn how to to read. Freddy just got bought by a 5 year old girl named Sophie. In order to learn how to read Freddy looks into Sophie's spelling book where it gives a word and and beside it a picture of that word. All the sudden Sophie's mom gets an allergic reaction to Freddy and Freddy has to live with Mr. John, Sophie's neighbor. Mr.John places Freddy on a book shelf. There Freddy can read those books. This is a great, funny book that I enjoyed reading about. And I think you would to!"
4,A cute story with an even cuter main character!,"I think that this is a fantastic book! I think it's really cool to read a book that is written from the perspective of a hamster. I have always wanted a pet hamster, gerbil, mouse, or guinea pig, but if reading this book is all I can get it is good enough! Freddy is a really funny character with his own cute little quirks. This book has tons of great characters and also, I must say, fantastic dialogue. I recommend this book to all animal lovers. I just can't wait for the next installment in The Golden Hamster Saga!"
2,"Tedious, Repetitive, Pretentious","I agree with Steven Roberts -- this book is very repetitive. It is almost 800 pages long. It could have been cut to 400 pages with some editing to remove successive pairs of sentences that say almost exactly the same thing and to remove exasperatingly repetitive references to the literature.The authors are very fond of ""noting"" things. I didn't count, but I'm sure that the formulation ""We note that ..."" must appear at least 1000 time in this book.I think this is the most tedious book I have ever read. I did force myself to read every page. But in the end, my take is that it was much too great an investment in tools. All of the examples in the book are either hypothetical or toy-like. I can't see any reason why all of the (pseudo)mathematical superstructure was necessary."
2,relatively useless,"This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a ""real"" sociology book."
3,"Half awesome, half no flavor at all","I have been buying these for years now. For some reason (quality control?) the last box ended up with two completely different flavors; about half were delicious apricot and the other half were tasteless. I guess I am glad at least I didn't get an entire box of the tasteless rolls! I wish Joray had better quality control because ""when they are good they are very very good, but when they are bad they are horrid..."""
1,"Worst ""fruit"" roll ever!","I miss read the brand, thinking this was the Jovey fruit rolls I got as a kid. This is NOT anything remotely similar. The texture is that of plastic and it has so much food coloring it is neon orange. What a disaster of an order. It makes fruit by the yard look like health food."
3,a heavy handed critism,This book was interesting and infuriating. the author focuses on the miracle cure more than she focuses on portrayal of disability in children's books. Her indults of Louisa may Alcott's writing was almost more than i could bear. It was not her handling of the sanctimonious Beth that bugged me so much as it was her own dissapointment At the ending that made that chapter read like she booked no argument. Mostly this book felt angry . The author lashing out at the world. also if leg problems are the only ones adressed the author should say so in the summary.
2,Why am I bothering with new music?,"I need to just deal with it; I'm old and out of touch and I think anything new that came out during the last four or five years is a big steaming dumpster load of suck and anyone who likes it must be an idiot. This sounds like a pretentious post-hardcore band with Yosemite Sam on vocals. I swear I heard him sing the lyric, ""I'LL KEEL HAUL YA/YA LOW DOWN DIRTY VARMINT"". Do kids like that sort of thing nowadays? Freakin' kids."
5,JEEP CHEROKEE CHRYSLER 8.25 LOCK RIGHT LOCKER,The product fits and is working great. The directions are poor when installing it. The internet and forums are a source of better info than the installation manual that came with the product. I previously installed a lock right in front in my dana 30 and ran great. Never got stuck and never had problems. Installed the rear locker and it is just a machine. I rock climb 3.0-4.0 trails and run 33x12.50 tires and they haven't failed me yet. Great product I would recommend to anyone.
2,Montana,"This book was okay. It wasn't the best though. You can tell what the plot is after the first chapter. The author tried to put some mysteries in the book, but it just made the stories drag on and on. It wasn't at all dramatic. It was kinda romantic. But towards the middle of the book, you already knew who the characters would end up with. This book could of have been one of those books that would hold you in suspense. But the way it was written, all you'd say is 'Oh, Didn't see that coming. Oh well' And when they proposed, they all said the same thing. How much they loved her, and that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with her. I thought that it was ridiculious to have a town such as Rocky Bluff. Except for when we go to meet the Lord. It was hard to imagine living in a town where everyone actually liked everyone. You certainly had to stretch your imagination."
3,Montana Skies,This book was alright. But the author used the word 'extremly' way too many times. Each time you turned the page you would find the word extremly. It got boring after a while. I would definetly say that the first story 'Healing Love' is the best out of the four.
5,Outstanding album!,"This is by far one of their best contributions, better than Free Fall and the 1961 releases in my opinion. It is extremely modern but always with a pulse that sometimes becomes almost like a swing. If you love modern jazz improvisation deprived of cliches, this is an incredible album for you. Highly recommended!"
5,Saturn,"For anyone who is interested in astronomy, especially when it relates to the planets in our solar system, this is a must have. The book beautifully describes and illustrates this elegant planet, providing detailed photos of it's body, rings and moons. I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely LOVES it!"
4,"For fans wanting the original mono, there are other options","As others have stated, these are not the original mono single mixes. Those are available in a different box set. This collection features stereo versions (many newly mixed expressly for this set) of many familiar (maybe overly familiar) classics. Yes, some of them can be jarring, because we're so accustomed to hearing them in that flat, ""AM radio"" kind of sound. Keeping in mind that those final mono mixdowns were the reason for the creation of the multitracks used to also create these stereo versions, it should be easy to appreciate that there were a lot of limitations in creating great-sounding stereo from them. But Tom Moulton did it. Are these meant to replace the original singles? No. Are these great on their own merits? Yes. I have both. I play both. I'm glad that both exist. The packaging on this is also really good. It would have gotten five stars except for the skimpy content on disc four."
4,Motown Box Series,"The Motown sound on 4 cds was the best diversity I have collected to this date. It brings back memories of the kind of music the 1960s. I have in my collection just single groups like the Platters, Drifters, and Percy Sledge but this series had a little of everything including songs and artist almost forgotten.I recommended it highly for its great music should be preserved for musical heritage and a plus for us who were teenages during this time."
3,"Disgusting, yet saved by eternal genius !!!!!!!!!","The re-mixer of most of these jewels, Tom Moulton, must have been given something to sabotoge the integrity of a work that ,even through his careless ""hands""(ears), still illuminates and shines against the newer music of today that still can't hold a candle next to Motown's eternal genius. This music is too too good still and crafted like none on earth to date yet some of the songs listed were seriously slayed and marred. The genius of Motown still comes through. A person undertaking a feat such as to remix and stereo-fy this music must be of the ancestry that birthed this sacred historical one-of-a-kind music. It, however, remains as unchangeable as DNA ... MOTOWN !!!!!!!!!!"
2,questionable choices and a 34 minute rip-off,"with so many hits to choose from there is bound to be debate about what should be included in this set. there are some great works here, not my 1st choices, but as a 50 year old human i find myself reliving part of my childhood with each listening. the problem is with cd #4 which clocks in at 34 minutes which blows my mind. there are literally 1000s of hours of motown available and to fill a cd to less than 1/2 of it's capacity is a total rip-off. shame on you."
1,Waste of money.,I could have seen more action at a gentlemans club for less money. Just some painted-up girls showing leg. Crummy.
5,"Soft, Sexy, Sensual","I'm a female lover of 90's Playboy, and this one was a hit! Attractive men, beautiful (and enviously voluptous) women in sultry senarios. Sometimes Playboy's sketches can get a bit too silly, but I found these all to be pleasantly erotic. As another reviewer said, content is tame. But it's still a visual delight (and as a lady, gets me going...)"
2,disappointed,I was expecting the Dr. Grip line to have a consistently soft grip. This was not as soft as the Center of Gravity line under the same Pilot Dr. Grip brand. The Center of Gravity's grip is a lot softer and it conforms to your fingers. This was just regular rubber.
5,Best pens in the world.,"I have been using this kind of pen for years. The only reason I bought a new one was because I lost one of the old ones, but it was still in great shape after at least 5 years of use. I love the wide barrel with the soft grip. I have arthritis and do a huge amount of writing, so I needed something comfortable. This has met all my needs, and is pretty as well. The refills are also some of the least expensive out there and last for some time. I would recommend this pen anyday."
3,Y pipe upgrade,"Fit was good , quality of material was good. I was a little disapointed that it was wrinkle bent vs/ mandrel from a big company . I felt that the price was good and not worth time for me to modify my existing Y pipe as I upgraded from 305 to a 350 and upgraded entire exhaust from 2 1/2"" to 3"" single system ."
4,Gifted it....,I bought this book for a friend named Cecily. It's a cute little story about Curious George (before he was his own celebrity). I don't really get some of the complaints in the other reviews.We don't own this book for ourselves but it was a very well-received gift! :D
1,Attractive illustrations but utterly weird,"Attractice illustrations combined with Curious G, pulled my 4yr old's attention to this book. WHen we read it, I just could not digest the story. Cecily will just do whatever the monkeys ask her to, even if it is dangerous to her and she is not enjoying it. This utter compliance (which is wrong) made me point out to my son that you really cannot tie someone's neck to a tree or slide down their back with a pointed ski poles. I don't know what the author was thinking, it is almost sadistic."
4,The first introduction of Curious George,"This book has charming illustrations of Curious George and his siblings. It's actually the first book George ever appeared in. I think it can be enjoyed simply for that, keeping in mind it was written in simpler times before childrens' books were analyzed for political correctness. A previous review slashed this book saying the monkeys were cruel to the giraffe....I've never seen it that way, nor have the kids who I've read it to. See for yourself. If you're a fan of Curious George you'll enjoy seeing his debut."
4,Can Curious George Go Back to the Jungle???,"Cecily loves her new family of monkey children and tries to make them as happy as she can. It's fun seeing how happy Curious George was before he was kidnapped by the man with the yellow hat and carted off from the jungle to New York. He had a wonderful large family, of which he was a beloved member. When I read this to my second grade class, they were upset that he had been taken from them. I reminded them that anyone of them can write the book that takes George home again. And that's what's great about imagination! I like this book quite a bit, even though the giraffe is a bit too accomodating about what she will allow the monkey to do. But what they think up, and what she does, are very imaginative and warm."
1,Cecily shouldn't put up with that.,"I know many of you are going to complain about my lack of imagination, I take the book too seriously. I have read many many books to preschoolers, I grabbed this one up used at a yard sale. And when I came home and started reading it, I was not impressed. Cecily allows the monkeys to do all sorts of odd things to him, As mentioned, Tie him to a tree by his neck, ect.... in this reviewers opinion it is not appropriate for young readers. It crosses the line from cute and just for fun to Cecily allowing the monkeys to treat him in an inappropriate manner just to have friends to play with. I really enjoy many of the authors other books, but this one does nothing for me. I put my copy in the trash."
1,A bad c# book with a few simple finance examples,I unfortunately bought this book when there were no reviews. The book offers a VERY basic overview of c#. It offers virtually no insight into the advantages of c# in the financial industry. The only reason this book has anything todo with finance is that a few examples are very basic options conepts (ie a black scholes calculator). To top it off - the syntax has quite a number of errors. One is better off buying an o'reilly book for the c# and searching google for a few examples of c# use in finance.
1,Totally Superficial,"I haven't posted a review in a few years. But, this book drove me to it. To echo the comments of the last few reviewers, this book is neither a good introduction into C# or in applying C# in a financial programming context. Compare this book at 138 pages to another Wiley book, Modelling Derivatives in C++, which comes in at approximately 800 pages. How did Wiley let this book, Applied C# in Financial Markets, into publication??? Total waste of time and about the only thing that can be called applied C# in financial markets in this book is the title. As far as the one 5-star this rating this book got, I have to ask if that reviewer is friends with the author."
4,"So far, so good","I've only had it for a couple of months and haven't had any issues. It was easy to set up and takes up much less space on my desk. The sound is not very good at all, so if you watch a lot of videos or play a lot of music, you'll want to use other speakers."
5,A beautiful voice !,"Kimberly's music touches your heart. Every song has so much feeling in them. My daughter is getting married in June of 2000 and has chosen Kimberly's song ""Your Love Is All I Need"" to be played in the Church. This is one cd that I play from beginning to end, because every song is so good. I'm sure that this talented young lady will go a long way with her singing career."
1,Cross Ball-point Broad #2,"This refill manufactured by Cross is horrible. First of all is not black, it is more of a faited black/dark gray. It does not feed the tip fast enough so if I write fast it stops writing or get really faint in color. It is not constant and if I draw a long line about 3-4 inches, it would get many areas of no ink to very faint color. It is not because its old, I just bought it from Staples few days ago and it was like this from the very begining! Cross should be ashamed to make a product like this !"
3,Yet another repetitive compilation,"With all but the ""Story of a Young Heart"" album on CD, I sure wish one of these numerous compilations would at last include any tracks from that album that have not appeared on CD yet. The only new track here is the B-side ""Lost Control"". It would be nice to even see B-sides like ""Pick Me Up"", ""Windows"", ""Living In Heaven"", and Cosmos on CD, as well as the extended version of Lost Control.Also to note, this CD includes the LP mix of The More You Live The More You Love, not the 7"" remix, which is on ""The Best Of"" CD, and the long 5 minute version of ""I Ran"" that originally appeared on the CD version of Flock's first CD."
2,Not in It,"I am an avid collector of Playboy dvd. I was very excited to see this new title come out. Very disappointing. There really is only one very pretty girl in it. The girl who is in the college internet cafe. The others are all second rate internet models. My sole reason for buying this dvd was beacuse the blonde on the front is probably the best looking woman I have EVER seen. If you havent seen the cover, click on it, she is AMAZING. Guess what, she's not even in it. Outside of wasting my bucks, my only question is who is SHE?"
2,Poor print job,"The printing on this sticker is really grainy. Not a good job. It was cheap and looks cool, but on close inspection is really poorly printed."
5,awesome!,"Eliminating the need for my stroller is fantastic. i love this buggybag. Most importantly, my son LOVES this shopping cart cover. It's super easy to use, super comfy for baby- worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone who takes their baby with them shopping or to a restaruant. It's quite a tight fit to get the cover into a restaurant high chair, but it works. LOVE IT!!"
2,flat fanny pack.,"This fanny pack is very small. The sides come together to it goes into a V at the bottom. This can carry only keys, phone and cash. it is more like a fanny wallet than a fanny pack. The leather isn't great. The color, espresso brown, is very nice. If it was bought at a store i would return it, but by the time i return it and pay for the return, i would've basically wasted as much money as it costs. I'm disappointed because if seems like an envelope, not a pack. It is so small and thin that when i want to take something out i worry other things will fall out.summation - fanny wallet, not pack. :("
5,Assorted Leather Fanny Packs,I bought the black leather fanny pack and it has met my needs. I read from other reviews that it was not large and could not hold a large amount of items. I wanted a fanny pack to hold a few items and not a fanny pack that was huge. If you are looking for a fanny pack to hold a large number of items - this would not be it.
2,Broke after 40 days,"While the TV was working, the picture was great. I had my media PC, HD DVR, Wii, and DVD player all hooked up to it and everything worked fine. It's a very compact design (speaker is on the bottom) so it fits great in the room I have to work with.Sadly, about 40 days after purchase, the screen randomly went black. LG's replacement guarantee was for 30 days, and they wouldn't budge. I had to get a repairman to pick it up. I left town for the holidays and called the repair place to check on the status. They said they ordered the broken part from LG the day after they got the TV and had been waiting for it to arrive for nearly a month.It was a nice TV.. for the short period of time that it worked. It appears I'm not alone with this problem, either. This is my last experience buying from LG, thanks to defective products and rude (though very American!) customer support.I regret not buying a Samsung."
2,Black Screen of death,"I like so many others have experienced the Black screen of Death on a LG 47"" LCD 1080P flat screen. The TV, for no apparent reason, just goes out even though the power light still shows green. I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this TV from CompUSA (2 weeks ago) who is now out of business. I called LG and reported the problem and they gave me the number of a repair center. When I asked if they have ever heard of this happening to anyone else they told me it was a ""Known Issue"". I just don't understand how a company can sell products with ""Known issues"" and then make it the consumers problem. I'm dropping my TV off tomorrow for what I am expecting to be a very long period of time. Good luck to everyone having this problem. This is probably my last LG.P.S. I must admit though when the TV was working I was very happy with the picture and sound quality. However, the TV actually needs to be functional to give it a good rating. Without this issue it would have been a 4.5."
4,"If you liked Eerie Queerie, you'll love this one...","""Hands Off"" is super good. There isn't anything up on the Tokyopop website about it yet, but it focuses on a high school boy who is a psychic-catalyst, his cousin who sees past events, and his womanizing best friend who sees emotion-based auras. Wheee!All three boys are pretty, but the main character is the prettiest of the bunch and he's had some trouble being taken seriously because of his looks. In general, I enjoyed the art very much.In some ways, this book reminds me of Eerie Queerie, but I find it ten times better because of the psychic stuff. ^_^ It's also written much better with more of a coherent storyline than EQ. For the most part, the story is light and funny; a feel-good read. I look forward to the future volumes."
1,Its for Shoujo Fans not Shonen Ai Fans.,"To many friggin' chicks in this series, it is NOT anything like Eerie Queerie which at least had Shonen Ai. This Manga had 3 guys swooning over chicks - not something for ANY Yaoi fan."
1,Worst sports betting book I've ever read!,"Apparently, Amazon.com has some sort of private agreement with the publisher, as the first review that I wrote has been censored. This ""book"" is without merit. Two thirds of the content is filler - useless anecdotes that won't lead to putting any money in your pocket. The money management ""system"" proposed by the author is statistically unsound. If you want a solid sports betting primer, pass on this title and buy ""The Complete Book of Sports Betting"" by Jack Moore. For more in-depth info, obtain any work written by Bob McCune other than the ""Gambling Times"" book."
3,"Superb bibliography, but not the ultimate EC art book","While the bibliographical data is literally a life-long labor of love, I was disappointed by limited amount of images reproduced from the original artwork; the illustrations seem to be limited to photographs of the author's personal collection. The complete series of Graham Ingels' Old Witch paintings and sketches screams out for inclusion. I would have liked to see panel pages reproduced from the originals; full-color reproduction of line art reveals editorial changes, paste ups, blue pencil, and other subtleties undetectable in conventional reprints. A greater outreach to the art collector community could have yielded a definitive reference book/coffee table art book, but TALES OF TERROR fall short of this potential."
2,Too basic,"The information in this book is useful as an introduction, but it is not detailed enough to pass 70-029. Without using Transcender exams you wouldn't have a hope of passing."
5,Always Remember Peabo Bryson,Peabo Bryson is a national treasure. He is one of the true kings of Soul. I don't think that he has ever received the recognition that he deserves. This album is a wonderful compilation of many of his greatest hits. The songs are quite extraordinary and his smooth silky vocals are not to be missed.
5,Great talent,always have dug his voice and his talent always enjoyed all of the main hits. he had a style about him where you knew it was always him. very underrated artist and this is a must have for any fan of his work.
5,THE BEST!,THE BEST OF PEABO IS THE BEST. THE VERY BEST I LOVE THIS CD HAD THIS ON WAX NEEDED IT ON CD. GREAT PRODUCT AMND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION!!!
4,Peabo is here to stay,Love his music and his smooth voice. The album is a great addition to my collection. You will undoubtedly like the songs on this album.
1,never received cd,"well, have to say that I have never received this item , so my review is not good, I ordered this item over a month ago and still have not gotten . I have emailed more that 5 times and have not gotten a good answer back. My account was charged and to this day no refund or replacement for item ."
3,"Good, but not great.","It worked right out of the box, but I find that I have to pick each note pretty hard for it to register on my tuner. This isn't true with other pick-ups that I've used. Other pickups I've found are more sensitive."
1,Cambridge Soundworks,"I saw a few other comments regarding the scratchy sound when playing with volume and in regard to the sub sound. These speakers sound incredible, but you will be gauranteed to hate the scratching sound that will annoy you. Something seriously wrong here. Gets A 10 for the speaker sound, but the rest of the equipment gets a big fat zero. LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE!"
2,Duplicate videos,"These are the same videos being sold on ""Warbirds of WWII Airwar Over Europe"" The producer is repackaging the same videos under different titles to sell them twice."
1,CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR - A SHOCK FOR NEW REPLAY 5160 OWNERS,"FIASCO this makes these nuts look bad. - Unit not working, called for help on Tues Dec 16th Tech1 at Sonic Blue said the unit would need to be reset and we would not have this problem again. That evening Tech2 at Sonic Blue said it was a problem on their side. Wed we could not get through on hold 4.5 hours and disconnected. Thurs. Tech3 at Sonic Blue said they were still having problems on their side, then said the unit was defective, his supervisor, said it was them, then the unit.Over the course of 4 days, we were on hold over 7 hours, spent over 2 hours trouble shooting with Sonic Blue and had Sonic Blue flip-flop on where the problem is, first it is them, then our unit, then the service, then our unit. Whatever reason it really is, it appears that the service and the unit are defective. We will be ordering a TIVO unit."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"This is the best thing to TV since color! The commercial skip feature, while not perfect, well makes up for any steep price. Easy to use, and NO COMMERCIALS!"
5,"Wow, Replay is incredible","My neighbor showed me his Replay box and before I saw it I thought he was a religios nut!!! But, after looking at the features I now am a true believer in Replay. Replay will change the way you watch T.V. I now think of T.V programs as ""content"" and almost never watch live T.V. I come home, turn on the Replay and see what ""content"" I want to watch. I have become very aware that much of the programming I watch is not worth the commericals I would normally have to watch to receive the content. I will never NOT own a Replay. I also agreed that the skip-ahead button makes this product far superior to the Tivo product. Having to fast-forward through commericals using the Tivo product forces you to watch the commericals (Yuck!!!)."
4,"Fine, but don't connect by phone","A glitch with this otherwise very useful toy is that once the modem has connected to the ReplayTV service, it won't let go of the phone line. You have to plug it in at night, then unplug it in the morning if you want to use the phone line for anything else (and who can afford a separate phone line to make one call a day?). Tech Support, which is often unavailable and claims that a fix is ""coming"" and ""in the works,"" is hardly to be believed, as it's been this way for months and months. Software modems are not a new technology and one begins to wonder if 4504 owners are going to simply be left to deal with this problem as newer models emerge.One other little annoyance: SonicBlue uploads an ad for another product to serve as a screen saver. This kind of unasked-for advertising is a bit of an affront after you've paid for the machine and paid for the service.Other than that it's a very useful device, for the most part a big improvement over the old VCR."
2,Absolute worst customer service,"3 hours on hold and nobody ever picked up the phone, need I say more. It is good when it works. I am currently looking in to getting TIVO!"
2,Major Disappointment,"I just returned my 4508 for a refund, so consider the source.One day out of the box, my machine died. I returned everything and, two weeks later, received my repaired unit. Then, I noticed that the Commercial Advance feature wasn't working. ""Well, your replacement unit came with the old software. We will put you on the list for the latest version. Can't say when it will be available, but should be downloaded to your unit in two weeks or so."" Huh?When my ReplayTV worked at all, I found it 'okay'. Picture degradation was significant. I used the same cabling as for my VCR. I found the signal throughput was significantly worse for the ReplayTV. Software was very user friendly, and, on the one day when it worked, the Commercial Advance feature was quite good.The general idea of ReplayTV is good, bordering on great. But for [the] total cost..., I expected much better performance and service.Since I have yet to get my refund, my 'divorce' isn't final...."
2,Not that great,The ReplayTV was very disappointing. This unit dramatically reduced the picture quality of cable tv. Infact I had to buy a video amplifier in order to make the quality of certain stations acceptable. The quality of recorded shows was also very poor. Just to make it clear the quality of cable tv is excellent when the unit is not attached.Customer service is non existent. I sent 2 e-mails to tech support and NEVER received a reply.The good:- The commercial advance feature is cool- Don't have to rewind video tapesThe bad- The remote is big and not very well laid out.- The advertised 80hrs of record time is on the lowest quality setting. It gets about 25hrs on the high quality setting.- Picture quality is really bad- No tech-support
2,"Replay 4500 Series, great.","I purchased a ReplayTV 4508 as a replacement for my Replay 3060. The ability to move shows to and from my PC and share shows with friends was a huge draw for me. I'm very happy with the 4500 series, it does everything as advertised. I've found that I can store shows on my PC to get extra space.Replay is a great product, but one you should research before you purchase, not after."
3,Oldies but Goodies,"This album takes me back to the stuff I listened to while I was fighting the Viet cong in 1966-1968. When I got out of the hospital from wounds I received, I still enjoyed theis music. Now I will continue to enjoy it."
4,Very nice,"I just received my chafing dish today. I have not yet tried it out yet, but I'm very pleased with it so far. FYI, it is a 3 quart chafing dish."
5,Microbiology Lab Manual,This book arrived in excellent condition within the specified time. It was a brand new book and was exactly as advertised.
5,great,"I was very please. Service was fast, price awedsome,and merchandise in perfect shape. I will keep buying from you guys!"
3,FAIR CONDITION.,"THE MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY MANUAL WAS IN FAIR USAGE CONDITIONS,. ALTHOUGH IT HAS SOME MARKINGS, AND SOME OF THE PAGES WERE STILL NEW AND INTACT, AND THE EDGES OF THE BOOK WERE BENT AND HAVE ROUGH EDGES.THE PRICE FOR THE BOOK WAS TOO MUCH FORTHE CONDITIONS OF THE BOOK. ALTHOUGH THE BOOK CAME ONE WEEK EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED."
1,Needs More Research,"Although the maps and troops movements are adequate, unfortunately the author falls into the trap of putting out a sanitized (and grossly inaccurate) account of the War Between the States. His ""Origins of the War"" dealt more with propaganda than with any factual information. The book would have been far more interesting had he actually researched the events taking place prior to the war (ie: the tariff battles and sectional conflicts relating to how the federal budget money was being spent disproportionately), this book would have been a much better work. As it stands, he should have either not delved into the causes (and got it wrong, as he did), or he should have done more research in that area prior to actually writing the book. Disappointing."
1,No REAL history here,"Mark Swanson states that he is a historian, which is an insult to all the individuals that actually delve into history in its entirety without slanting facts to their prejudices. Swanson's ""Introduction - Origins of the Civil War"" is an account of slavery in the United States and not one iota more! An uninformed person would believe that slavery was the only cause of the WBTS. Save your money and buy one of the many other books that will provide this information without a Marxist point of view."
1,"Good maps, bad research","This book has a good collection of maps and does a fair job of tracking troop movements but has a definite biased slant and innaccurately stresses slavery as the major cause of the war, even though this didn't become a real issue until 1862, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation (which is a masterpiece of doublespeak that actually freed NO ONE AT ALL, since Lincoln had no authority over the Confederacy, and specifically excluded northern states). There is an emphasis on negative Southern acts, such as Longstreet's foraging mission in North Carolina, while northern atrocities are glossed over. An impressive piece of historical bias and revisionist history, and only the maps are of interest. Most of those are available for free from the National Archives, just to name one source, or other better-written works, so don't waste your money."
4,Great oldies on this CD!,"This is one of my favorite oldies but goodies CD out of the collection! It contains fantastic music from the 50s and 60s, but also has a small touch from the 70s with Before the Next Teardrop Falls by Freddy Fender. Here you have such classics like Sealed with a Kiss, At the Hop,Popsicles and Icicles,and two songs that hit the top 40 on the R&B charts!"
1,Bose Wave,"I have had 3 of thes units in 2 years, now the 3rd unit is bad and needs to be sent back for a cost of $99.I can not see spending over $100 each year for this unit the sound quality is not worth the hassel.I suggest looking for other units.Check on the web there are many complaints on Wave units, wish I had.Now it is a very expensive clock."
3,Great sound!,Sounds and looks great. The only downfall is that there are no controls on the unit so if you loose the remote you cant use it.
2,great sound but design (remote) lousy,"I have had it a couple of years. The sound is great. However, what idiot decided to have no controls except by remote? And to make it worse the supplied remote is a JOKE. Its range on a good day is maybe 4 feet. Most of the time it won't work at all. Some buttons work some time. I leave it turned on in the AUX mode since that is the only way I use it anyway (nothing on the radio worth tuning in these days). Unfortunately if the power goes out, even for a split second, while it will retain the time, etc. it will NOT keep the unit ON. I have to fool around for several minutes hoping I can get the remote to work for a second or two so I can get it turned on and actually use it. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. HOW DO INSANE DESIGNS LIKE THIS GET RELEASED ON AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC? I know Bose is supposed to be a good company but they dropped the ball big time on this."
2,Avoid,"Sure it sounds nice, but why after spending $350 on a RADIO, to only include a flimsy remote controller the size of a credit card with no controls on the unit itself is a big miss. Right now, I've lost my remote, not hard to do since it's miniscule and I cant use the radio. Problem, well my alarm is set, so it does go off at 6:45 am, but in order to turn it off, I need to get out of bed and unplug the unit. Also, there are only 6 pre-sets, why when most cheap radios give you 8 or 12? The reception is only mediocre, I'm constantly adjusting the placement in order to optimize reception and no, I'm NOT spending extra for an antenna.All this for $350. I could have gone to radio shack to get one for $10...avoid.."
1,No Buttons - Big Hassle,A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so. I have the older models (CD & Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating.I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system. I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate.
3,I had one big disappointment,"I purchased this item thinking it could be connected to and used with the Bose multi-cd changer. They are not compatible and my first thought was, the Bose reputation took a hit. I would think all products in a line of entertainment items should be compatible and interconnectible. Not true...thus my disappointment. I had ordered both and consequently ended up sending both back and purchasing the Bose radio with cd changer."
4,Bose Wave Radio II,"This latest model has excellent sound and an elegant look. However, the controls are no longer on the unit itself but only on the remote. Aside from the problem of where to store the remote in a secure spot so that it doesn't fall behind the bedside table or on the floor, I use this radio as an alarm so this frequently creats problems when I am sleepily fumbling for the snooze button or the off button and I either can't find the remote or I brush it off the bedside table and under the bed. Of course, that means that I do get up but in a very irritable mood."
2,Even a Bose lover thinks it's weird,"I've had Bose wave radios for about twenty years and at present have four -- almost one for each room. One is ancient, but still going. I'm looking for another one. I see the latest has no controls on the radio itself. What was Bose thinking? Imagine having to rely on the teensy-weensy remote (lose-able, dog-chewable) to make it work.Onward and upward! Tivoli? Boston Ac? Ah, thank goodness for Sangean!"
3,Think Again,"I've got all sorts of Bose equipment and purchased the Wave radio in 2008. Like all their gear you can not adjust the treble or bass. Pretty arrogant design. When played loud the music sounds great. you can play this radio really loud. However, at normal listening levels, just like the micro speakers, it sounds very, very thin. If the source is a perfect digital mp3 it sounds great at low levels but that's not reality. Radio reception is poor. I have multiple $25 radios in the house tha t get stations in much more clearly."
2,Bose wave radio has poor FM reception,This radio has good sound and plays CDs great but its FM reception is horrible. If you have flourescent lights anywhere near the radio it picks up distortion. I tried the optional FM antenna that Bose sells and it still does not get good reception. I called Bose and the service tech on the phone said that his own Wave radio also has this problem but that the company would not take it back. All they offered was another FM antenna hookup and I will have to go to RAdio Shack and purchase a better antenna. For $500 the radio ought to work. I have a 20 year old Panasonic Boom box in the same area and it works fine with the flourescent lights on. This is my first and last Bose product. Check the internet others have also complained about the same FM reception issues.
1,No need for silly hostess/narorator,"I bought this for my 3 year old son. He was not intersted in all the talking by ""Laurie Dash"". Too many jokes that aren't funny or related to the hero and not enough action to keep a young child interested. The ""There goes a...firefighter/hero/police officer...series is much better. There is a host but also lots of action to keep a young childs attention."
3,Pop-Up Stopper does the job for the most part.....,"I just installed this software a couple of days ago and it actually does stop pop-up ads while playing a cool sound-byte of your choice (such as a bomb exploding, toilet flushing, etc...) The only disappointing thing that I found out AFTER I installed it is that it only works with Microsoft Internet Explorer and NOT with Netscape. Also, it does not work with the AOL built-in browser, so if that is your primary means of surfing the net (like it is for me), then this software won't help you. ... This is the info I wish I had before I purchased this software."
1,Has a mind of it's own.,"This gizzmo catches about 1 of 4 pop ups and unders. Gambling ads have it completly flumoxed. It seems to be able to choose if it will load when you log on. Sometimes it will actually ID your home page as a pop up and stick you inside of some kind of a loop. My suggestion? With pop ups be coming more and more annoying, some software co. has to working on a better product.Be patient."
2,why buy?,i used this program for a few weeks.. works ok .. but i then got the google tool bar for free i like its pop up stopper better.. check it out its free...
2,People buy this stuff?,"You could buy this, or you could get a browser like Mozilla (which is free) that does the same thing."
1,Shouldn't it actually stop popups?,"It's called ""Pop-up Stopper"". Maybe I'm missing something but, shouldn't it actually stop pop-ups?"
3,Fuzzy Picture,Althought the price is right the picture could be alot better. It is fuzzy almost all the time. I would not suggest buying this product. It is a waste of money when there are so many other great televisions out there.
4,Goldie Hawn,Great movie and received as agreed. Love anything with Goldie and have purchased several of her movies. Great actress and co star
5,Melodic Rock/Metal at it's Best!,"All I can say is that this cd is killer!, if you enjoy Metal/Rock from the 80's with todays production technology, good writing, great playing and of course excellent singing, then you have to get this cd. Pink Cream 69 is one of the best bands I heard in years next to ""Silent Force""for this type of music. Dennis Ward is the producer and bassist, but he also writes alot of the music, and he does a find job, there's not one bad cut on this cd. I highly Recommend it."
5,Makes Empanadas Easy!,"These dough presses make life so much simpler when it comes to empanadas! Super easy to use, choice of size, easy to clean. Couldn't be simpler!"
4,Works as intended,"This is a second set I'm using, works well, a little flinsy(sp) the last one I had was made of stonger material."
5,"Dough press for individual pies or "" empanadas""","Very easy to use, dough does not stick to the surface. Helps to produce then faster, and so pretty, this product for good bakers definitively recomend !"
5,Excellent,"Well made....every size you need.The cutter function on the bottom is handy...for dough rolled 1/8"" thick. It is hard to find 4"" cutters. I do have metal 4"" cutter.There are many recipes out there for these Dough Presses.Handle with care...they are not made of metal."
4,FINGERSAVER DOUGH PRESS,"GREAT ITEM AFTER I LEARNED SECRET OF HOW TO USE IT. NO MORE SQUEEZING DOUGH WITH FINGERS. RESULTS ARE NEAT LOOKING, TIGHT SEALED, DOUGH ITEMS."
1,This Product is useless!,"I bought this product to specifically make mini pie pockets for my kid. At first use, it breaks the dough in the middle, and when I got this product figure out, it broke in one end. This product is not Dishwasher ready."
1,ordered it never got it,"but no worries, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and found it for 10 dollars LESS. so Im glad they didn't send it"
1,"Messy, time-consuming and a pain","I bought these in the hopes of making ravioli and pierogies, but was greatly disappointed. It takes too long to flour each press individually, but if you don't, the dough will stick and the pocket will fall apart when you try to open the press. I tried making ravioli with a spinach mixture, and not only did about half of the mixture leak out when I tried to close the press, but the pleat wouldn't stay closed if I didn't place the pocket in boiling water immediately. Maybe jams work better in these pockets, but my experience has been terrible. I'll be recycling these this week and ordering another ravioli mold."
2,Great until it breaks,This helped me make lovely cherry turnovers and two calzones before it broke. The hinges are held together by very cheap plastic. If they break you are out of luck.
3,mediocure,"good tool for smooth fillings, but I didn't have luck making empanada's with meat, completely tore out the bottoms when I folded the pies. I recommend, you refridgerate your filling before using, and that you leave dough just a bit on the thicker side."
5,Empanada whiz,"This is the best mold for empanada's. I make big batches, freeze them and get wave reviews."
5,Empanada Press,This 4-piece dough press set made making empanadas (beef turnovers) so much easier and faster to make. The various sizes to choose from is a plus!
5,"Multi-use, good quality","The several differant sizes are great. With the largest you can make from personal pocket meat pies for lunches, medium you can make 3-bite fruit pies for snacks & the smallest is great for homemade pierogues.The items themselves are well constructed (don't overfill them or you will rip the dough)& are very easy to wash.Very pleased with the product & it saved my backside this past holiday season!Thanks!"
2,Dough Press Set,"It's ok, but not overly impressed. I thought the largest piece was a bit bigger than it was. I needed something larger."
3,Good,"I like the fact that it comes in 4 different sizes... The quality is good so far...the only thing is that if you make dumplings with this, you need to use oil or flour for the ends, or else the dough will stick to the press"
3,Ok Product,"Received the product but it is not what i expected on the size. But, it is still ok! Besides, the mod on bottom is not flat."
1,Advertising sold as a book,Somebody ripped me off by selling this as a book. It's advertising for a product that is no longer for sale. Get the picture?
5,Finally! Some fresh air into the genre!,"If there's anything that really impressed me about this book, it was the expansion of the concept of a house, hitherto seen only in tiny glimpses, even in fantasy writing. Lovely, and immeasurably exciting. It is reminiscent, I think, of the best in high fantasy."
1,"""The High House"" was offensive and poorly written.","I received my copy of ""The High House"" as a gift, which I consider a personal offence. Being an anarchist (a much- misunderstood political philosophy that involves organization without hierarchy- not chaos or bombs), I found the author's trashing of the anarchist point of view (which, might I add, he obviously did not research beforehand) appalling. Stoddard's ""anarchists"" bore no resemblance to anarchists in real life. If he was going to make his antagonists anarchists, he could have at least researched anarchism before he blindly trashed us, spreading yet more misconceptions about what anarchists believe. I must admit that the premise of the book was interesting; however, I found the book itself to be offensive and poorly written, with irritating characters and *really* bad dialog."
4,An impressive first novel,"James Stoddard is clearly an author worth knowing about. His worldbuilding is simply wonderful, and his description is good, although a little more would have been nice in some places. The characters are mostly believable, and the plot is enough to keep the book moving. Above all, he seems to be an author with good ideas. (Actually, I've had some of these ideas myself; I'm slightly irked that he published first, though obviously it's not his fault.) Of course, the book isn't without flaws. Though he calls the villains anarchists, that isn't really what they seem to be, and they don't always act in ways that make sense. (Why a bobby, anyway?) There's also the occasional line of hokey dialogue...but who really cares? This book is still more imaginative, more interesting, and more fun than most of what's out there, and I suspect Stoddard will iron out many of the problems in his next few books. Enjoy."
5,Great Debut!,I haven't enjoyed a book this much for quite awhile. It exhibits an excellent combination of adventure and allegory. Very highly recommended.
5,"Underrated, underrated, underrated!","I wince every time I see a poor review of this album. I loved Suicaine Gratification when it was released in 1999, and I still consider it one of Mr. Westerberg's best works. Notice that I did not say ""best SOLO works."" Suicaine Gratification is far stronger than the last two Replacements albums. His incisive wordplay and irrepressible sense of melody are in full strength. ""It's a Wonderful Lie,"" the opener, is simply one of Westerberg's best songs. Period.The songs about relationships are not happily-ever-after, but when were they ever? My favorites are ""Final Hurrah"" (how many of us have had a ""latest last chance,"" or more than one?), and the deceptively bouncy ""Whatever Makes You Happy.""In another of my favorites, ""Fugitive Kind,"" Westerberg sings, ""I'm a bad idea whose time has come."" Amen."
4,"Strong album, Westerberg's rawest solo to date.","Westerberg's 3rd solo album was his rawest, most organic-sounding solo album at that time. Songs like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Self-Defense"" sound like they were recorded the moment they were written. They are both sparse and beautiful. Most of the album explores quieter moments with only a few songs featuring a ""full"" rock sound and getting over mid-tempo. If Westerberg's singer-songwriter side is what you prefer, this is a great album to begin with. But any fan of introspective rock n' roll will enjoy this album immensely."
2,SLACKING BY A SLACKER,"The greatest affliction Paul Westerberg has to fight is his absurdly adoring fan base - they worship him the same way cultists of Kerouac and Plath lay prostrate. That's a nice way of saying he's nowhere near as good as his followers say he is, and this is coming from someone who loved The Replacements more than any other band on the planet.Westerberg's solo albums have been fine until this one. I'm afraid ""Suicaine Gratifaction"" is a tedious exercise in pretension, the product of someone whose buddies have fooled him into thinking he's a genius no matter what he does. It's flat and it's boring.One of Westerberg's [fans] told me that ""Suicaine"" was his greatest solo record because it was a giant F. U. to everyone, from his record company to his fans. Be that as it may, I'm not in the habit of being told to go F myself, and neither should anyone else.If you want to pay 34 bucks for this record, more's the pity."

5,Complete Genius,"I am a huge ""Ricky"" fan not from Eastenders but Ricky Gervais. He's a comic genius of our time. I totally relate to his antics, his comic timing is flawless and this collection of the first season is amazing!! Of course now that the second season is running word is out and all A listers want to jump at the chance to be in his series. I bet Jude is kicking himself in the head for letting our old Ricky down. With or without him, Extras is flawless!!. I love you Ricky, wish I could meet ya sometime!!!!"
2,Not up to Ricky,"I've seen season 1 and a few episodes of season 2, and this British comedy doesn't make it. Its humor is based on awkward situations and semi-clueless characters. Some of this is funny but much is uncomfortable and just plain flat - a kind of Seinfeld meets The Office meets Curb Your Enthusiasm (of the three, I only liked Seinfeld) - not as well done, though."
2,didnt watch after the 1st episode,"I know everything on HBO is far better than anything else on TV. I figured extras would also be great. I was disappointed.I only watched the 1st episode but didnt think it was worth paying for the rest of the season.there was a few good jokes and im sure there are many rabid fans of the show, but I think it wasnt up to HBO levels."
4,Very happy.,I was very pleased how promptly my DVD arrived. I don't even have to mention how hilarious is Ruckey Gervais. Thank you.
3,"Great comedy, but not as hilarious as ""The Office""","Title says it all. It is quite funny, especially when the celebrity actors show ""their"" twisted side. Only 6 episodes is pretty disappointing for a season too (why do they require 2 discs??)."
4,razor sharp dry humor galore,After watching the American version of the Office I was curious to see what the original BBC version;s counterpart was up to. I was not dissappointed. His masterful blend of calous humor and steely dry wit left me laughing out loud and a fan for Life! Well done!!
5,Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant Do it Again,"Extras is absolutely hilarious... Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant are genuises. This character is much more sympathetic than David Brent, but the cast of characters surrounding him (his friend, agent and other competiting actors) are perfect complements to paint the picture of his quiet desperation. Also, the cameos (Ben Stiller, Kate Winslett, Orlando Bloom, etc.) are great, their characters are so opposite of their public persona that it makes for some really good laughs."
1,Don't get it...,I made the mistake of purchasing both Season 1 and Season 2 on the basis of critics' reviews. Couldn't make it through the first episode...
4,Very Sturdy,"Appears to be able to support me and my dogs (uninvited, but curious!) and even another person without a problem. Only comment is that it would have been nice if it included a connector for hammocks that are less than its astoundingly huge 15ft length! I had to go out and buy some 800lb test chain and hack saw it to size. It now works great, but sawing steel is quite the task!"
5,Better than described,"THe information on this item doesn't say - IT SNAPS TOGETHER. This feature makes this the best stand that we have ever had. You can keep it in the basement, or in the garage, and then pop it together in two minutes, right when you want to use it. It is the best!"
1,the annoying stuff,this isn't not worth buying or even staring at. i mean if you read it you might be thinking right now...why do people even bother read these reviews this is a horrible book imma watch tv! i defenetly recomend throwing this book away i don't even know why they made it a book. this is the worstest thin i have ever read. i have seen the show and it's ok...only when it ends i can't beleive people actually like this stuff.
4,Can't wait for the Next Couple of Seasons,"If you're a hard corps Seinfeld fan, this book is for you. The one major complaint this reviewer has is that frankly, several of the episodes are weakest in the Seinfeld library, and who really wants to read those over and over again. Once the third and fourth seasons come out (and I hope they will) these books will definitely be five star caliber."
5,Great Resource with Professional Service,"This book prepares the student for ASVAB and More. If you are preparing for the GHSGT, you can easily use this book as a vital resource."
3,Good but not complete,I thought the book was pretty informative but some of the pictures were real dark therefore not being able to show complete detail and his serial numbering dates were a little vague
4,My impression ?,"This book truly offers a lot of information but however, it should be mentioned that the pictures generally are of a very low quality as a result of which the distinguishing of (important !) details is hardly possible. The (few) drawings are of an even worse quality. Also the chapter covering the P88 and P99 is inadequate (notably for the P99)and the subtitling of the pictures sometimes is completely wrong. Nevertheless this book has to be considered worth its price because,again, it offers lots of info (especially on prewar models) and the book reads in an agreeable way (courtesy of the author)"
2,Where's Faragon?,"When I picked this up, I thought the focus of the book would be about Faragon Fairingay. It wasn't. It was still about a Bear named Bear, an Otter named Otter, and a Dwarf named Broco wandering around lost while everyone else picks up rifles and shoots at each other.It wasn't good fantasy and it wasn't enjoyable."
1,Piece of Junk,The plastic clip that holds the phone in place broke after about a week.Don't waste your money.
5,The Model Six are Model speakers,I received these speakers as a gift and have been nothing but impressed. They have a terrific sound. Great bass and at a very affordable price. I highly reccomend the Model-six bookshelf speakers!
4,children's vitamins,"I got this thinking that i would be able to take it but it is strictly for children, it is definitely tasty, tastes like a really strong ""Tang"" so it will be great for your children, no bitter taste"
2,PABA?,Why is there PABA in this? Hasn't it been deemed unhealthy and unsafe? I'm not sure why it's added so that kids ingest it if it's unsafe...can someone advise?
4,kids multi vitamin/mineral suppliment,"I like this product because my picky toddler doesn’t eat well, this product have many essential vitamin and mineral comparing to other products, so I am happy to have this product. I believe this product is high quality; price is good and it’s affordable to me,"
4,obscure but worthwhile,"This is great, inventive ""post-hardcore"" sounding music. I'll admit that the vocalist's monotonal delivery is a little off-putting, but, he was more of a performer with great lyrics than a singer. What I find most interesting/impressive is the guitarist's ability to use two finger tapping and make it sound so appropriate in the song. He actually used it for more of a riff than the typical flashy solo purpose. You probably won't even know he's doing it just from listening! It's worth finding."
4,A good sobby romance,A good story of four people who care about each other and are faced with a horrific life threatening plague. I found myself crying in several places. Beautifully written.
2,NOTE DUPLICATES!!!!,What kind of idiot put this collection together?!? SEVERAL songs duplicated from one disc to another! Buy a different collection.
5,Makes My Heart Ache,"I grew up in San Francisco, not So Cal, but these songs remind me of not only my adolescent and teen years but my older sisters who is no longer with us. I remember being about 10 years old and her having her red radio under the bed at night and listening to these songs while she was in bed and i danced to them too."
2,Poorly made,"These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty. It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material. My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor. Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up. The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable. It's an ""overstich"" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off. There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes."
4,convertible gloves,There is a trade off for these gloves. They have the nice feature of being able to use your fingers.But snow or wind can get inside the flap where your fingers are.
4,Good for home theater,"You should know that you'll need a powered subwoofer to go along with these little speakers if you want bass. But if you use them in a home theater application, you'll definitely enjoy them. They really do offer everything you could want for music and sound effects. I've paired mine with my Cambridge Soundworks Basscube 10."
5,"Better,faster & costs less also.","If you are just starting canning here is all you need to handle jars and lids. I wasted hours running around and on the phone.What I needed was not in any! stores.Here was every thing I needed at the click of a mouse.If I had ordered from the manufacturers of the canning jars it would have been weeks,cost more and didn't include the jar opener."
3,Not a necessity.,"This was a nice set of canning tools I THOUGHT I needed. The wide-mouth jar funnel and the jar lifter are about the only items I regularly use, although the lifter is a bit akward. The magnetic lid lifter is nice but if you can use a pair of chopsticks they work just as well. Also I already had the pair of tongs in the set, and what is the jar wrench for? It's a good set to have around but with some imagination, and a working pair of hands, you can still manage to can and preserve to your hearts content without it."
4,Great....but.....,"The canning set was pretty good. No home canner can be without good tools - especially the jar grabber. Oh! You can kiss goodbye those horrible memories of trying in vain to get those jars out of the boiling water with your bare hands.BUT there is one drawback to the set. The tools are a little short for my tastes. For anyone who cans seriously, you'll know that the tools need to be long enough not to have to touch the water. The can lifter is not quite long enough to do much of anything.With that being said, this is a pretty great starter set for anyone just getting into canning."
4,This is NECESSARY,"If you are going to can, you NEED these implements. It cuts time, mess, and bandaids (for the burns). The price on this kit is good compared to others."
2,This is junk,"You get what you pay for with this product; a poorly made/assembled group of tools used for canning. I would recommend spending a little more on a better quality canning kit. When I opened the package a rivet (that was supposed to be holding the can extractor together) fell out of the box. Unfortunately that was the main tool I needed, and I had to improvise."
5,Satisfaction Level,I am very satisfied with this product.It made my jam making this year much easier.
3,It was good.,"I really like this video I love trying new things with sex it makes, our sex lives much more exciting then the plain ol' regular way!"
5,It is really enticing.,Seeing this video I really aroused & did sex with my wife whole night. Both of really enjoyed the night. Both reached their orgasm state.
4,Where's the Trailers?,Interesting and informative especially for an RVer. I especially liked the historical progression leading from Gypsies to today. I also appreciated a look at some of the more unique campgrounds like Quartzsite and the Slabs.But I wish he had more coverage of modren travel trailers. They make up a large part of today's RV sales and they shouldn't be writen off yet.
4,What a way to travel!,"Having worked in the very high end luxury coach industry for many years it was pleasure to get a look at the real grass roots of ""Mobile Mansions"". Very impressed with the research that went into this book. Beautiful photos, well written, an enjoyable read."
4,A gift to friends,"This was a gift to some friends who own an RV and they were delighted to get the book but so far, I don't think they have gotten into it, but I did leaf through it myself and found it a fun read."
5,Hertzel is both sensational and inspirational...,"I saw Hertzel Live in New York last year and got this cd at the performance. This album is absolutely gorgeous. The melodies, the vocals, the dreammy guitars are out of this world. So get a cd, and enter Hertzel's world; I promise, you will not want to return!"
5,Hertzel is absolutely fantastic!,"It is quite difficult finding a new artist that is good these days. Well, search no more...Hertzel has arrived...He's so mysterious and awesome...His voice and music is so penetrating and alive! This album is a must for everyone's music collection."
3,One Hit Wonders,"I bought this to play a few songs from it for someone's 50th Bday party. Only a few songs on it are really good, but I had little choice in releases they were on so I bought this one."
2,Filled with Inaccurate Analysis,"Chess Tactics ART was a great training tool for tactics. So when Covetica released it's endgame training, I bought it immediately. After only a few problems I started to be suspect of positions that were evaluated as +/- or =. I put the positions into Rybka and Fritz and they found the position to be -/+ or outright losing. The creators appear to have taken games from GM endgames with analysis from other GMs and never checked the positions against a decent computer engine."
3,Nice sparring partner,"I can't find anything here I would call a tutorial. There is a good variety of endgames here that you can practice with, and I find that very helpful in improving my game. But I have to study the openings in a book."
3,Okay RCA's,"These are deffo the cheap mans rca's if your on a budget these are for you, or if you have a system that doesn't run to hot their for you, if your stuff gets really hot and have fans running at all times these WILL break off in your female rca connector on your amp. just an FYI if it gets stuck in there with the pin.bend a sewing needle at a 45 degree angle heat it up and then stick it into the broken part of the rca inside the amp wait a minute and then pull it out."
2,"Usually LOVE Bryan Kest's videos, but not this one!","I have Bryan's Sweat and Tone Videos and I love them. I bought this one for those days when I didn't have enough time to do his other videos. It doesn't mention in the title or the description that this is 20 minute Power Yoga for BEGINNERS. It says it on the box if you look closely at the picture of the cover. I was looking for more of an intermediate to advanced tape. I did try it, however I was disappointed. Bryan talks way too much, way too fast, as if he's trying to hurry everything up so that we can be done in 20 minutes. Not the ""calmness in sensation"" that I usually get with Bryan's videos. If you really like his style in his Tone and Sweat series, I don't think this one is really for you. I highly recommend his other tapes."
5,GREAT DESIGN,"The stand was simple to put together, easy to move from one location to another, sturdy, and best of all, does not leave dead grass lines in your lawn as it sets on four small points...a real seller with this stand."
1,Two teens are too much?,"My hammock stand bent terribly out of shape. I've replaced the bolts, and hope the dents in the frame won't cause the new bolts to also bend.The largest weight I've had it support are two fifteen-year-old girls -- possibly a combined weight of 225? Seems like the frame should've outlasted four months and two teens..."
5,GREAT FIRST TEDDY BEAR!,"My son loves this bear. He is 3 years old and has taken ""pey-bear"" every where we go! So much that when he lost it, I ordered two more! So soft, perfect for little hands to carry, not too big like other teddy bears, washable....can't say enough about it! Great for snuggling at night in bed.Great for a gift to a new baby."
1,Poorly executed design,"I agree with Celeste...this pendant is not well made and appears to be unfinished. Her pictures are far more accurate than the Amazon views. I didn't pay much for it, so won't bother to send it back. Luckily, it's a Christmas stocking stuffer for my niece and she likes the ""industrial"" look, so maybe she'll think it's supposed to look like this!"
4,Yippee,"awsome product, not what i intended to get but thats on me. quick shipping no problems whatsoever. not to mention a collectors edition with action figure at a fantastic price. great seller thank you."
4,TEMELREiZ,"Yes...they did it again, but one thing they forgot is to make at least one track like dwr_budr or Adnan's .i wonder if they sold their 808 ? ..maybe next time :)"
5,"Different, and way cool...","This CD first dismayed me with its almost euphoric sound, but it took about 20 minutes before I realized how much I liked the departure. Overall, the sound feels slightly less heavy than some of my favorites like ""Lush"" and ""Monday"". Perhaps it's just an overall ""happier"" sound, but what makes it a great CD through & through is the ever-present rhythm & knock-you-down bass stylishly mixed within their exploration in a slightly different sound. Well worth the cost... (although I found it for $28 at the Virgin Megastore in Los Angeles). There's some neato photographs in the case folder thingie, too. It's just cool any way you approach it..."
2,This album is a grave disappointment,"This album leaves alot to be desired after the Insides release. You open the album cover and find a number of inane out-of-focus pix under a mysterious white cover. How appropriate for this album. Boring, one dimensional. Similar to the ""experimentations"" one finds on any ""new jazz"" radio stations in middle America."
5,Incredible. Absolute Orbital,I first got into orbital off a laser show that had one song of theirs. It's been uphill ever since. The newest collection is totally fresh with a new style. I like especially Way Out and Know Where to Run. To anyone who likes Orbital this is the album to get!!
4,Fun and interesting,"I love the way this book is organized because it makes it easy for kids (and adults) to use. I like the way it includes both Colorado life zones and Colorado ecosystems and that it includes geology, and plant and animal life. The photographs are excellent. I like the way the flowers are organized by color. My only quibble is with the binding. Since it is apparently a self-published book, I can see why they would opt for a less-expensive binding, but it makes the book difficult to use and mine is already falling apart. I will probably just take it apart and put it in plastic sheet protectors in a notebook. If you live anywhere on the Colorado Plateau and have or work with children, I recommend you purchase this book."
3,Good Book,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter as she is really into optical illusions. This has actually been something that the whole family has used and loved. Will be buying another in future.
5,A book worth purchasing!,"We have many other Magic Eye books and this one was just as good, if not better! My husband loves these books! A great Christmas gift!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Nice images, but book is falling apart","The images in the book are cool and there are a lot of them, but sadly the book cannot take much handling-my copy of M.E.G. has about 3 pages that have detattached. I have other 3-d image books and they are hard cover with durable binding, which is very necessary since the book gets a lot of handling when people are trying to see the images especially for the 2 page spreads."
3,Magic Eye vs. BOHDAN,"I'd have to agree with the above reviewer. The ""Great"" Bohdan has evolved 3D images beyond what Magic Eye offers. His exceptional use of detail brings the images to a point of realism. Unfortunately Another Dimension is out of print so you would have to check out 3-D Book of Angels or 3-D Bible Stories to see some of his advanced artwork. These 88 images by Magic Eye was another attempt to win the market with quantity over quality."
1,"The most over-hyped ""comedy"" of all time-FACT!","The Office might be mildly amusing if it really was a fly-on-the-wall documentary but to think that this dross is mentioned in the same breath as Fawlty Towers,defies belief.Vulgar,profane,mawkish-it's all of these but it certainly isn't comedic.The more we learn about the early years of Ricky Gervais (such as his failed attempt to become a rock star),the more obvious it becomes that he IS David Brent and this programme merely documents his desperate quest for fame.For witty,inventive and genuinely funny British comedy avoid this and try The League of Gentlemen,Phoenix Nights or Alan Partridge."
5,hilarious,"I don't even have the words to express how funny this series is. ""Cringeworthy"" is the best description I can come up with. The first season was great but this was fantastic. I would say get both seasons in order. They got more outragous with each season. To truly appreciate it, you have to picture that boss you had (you know the one) that thought he was more witty, more clever, and more popular than he actually was. By a factor of 100. David Brent is the least self aware character ever conceived on the small screen. The disco/robotic fusion dance number is a must see. Watch the whole thing, then watch the deleted scenes, followed by the outtakes. Wear Depends underpants to save your sofa, bed, whatever.I digress.It is a masterpiece of subtle, understated British humour. There's no laugh track, and the background noise is just plain office noises. It's mockumentary at its best.Just watch it."
5,Very sophisticated,"Forget Friends. This is humor for the thinking man or woman. No slap-stick, no canned laughter. This is British humor at its best. Those that can not figure out the punch lines had better leave this on the shelf. Congnito, ergo, sum, I wish American humor would grow up to be like this."
5,British humor? Absolutely!,"Steve Correll and folks do a great job at the American recreation of this British sitcom, but it still doesn't come close to the original! Thats a little too harsh... it does come close, BUT you gotta see the tea sippers version to really appreciate the colonists attempt!"
2,"Ricky, what went wrong?","Series One is absolutely brilliant. Heck, I still laugh wildly at scenes (Dawn's face as David explains how he could have slept on her floor if he got off at the wrong stop) that I've seen nearly a hundred times! Series Two, however, lacks continuous charm.As has been stated, David Brent starts to lose it in this series and I didn't find it funny but sad. It wasn't funny sad, it was just uncomfortably sad.That said, if you are a die hard Series One fan you must simply see Series Two as a follow-up. While you will mostly be disappointed, there are a few (and I really do mean a few) redeeming scenes (Brent giving his motivational talk and the photo shoot leading up to it--hilarious).For Series One fans this is a must but if you still need to be sold on British comedy after Series One don't waste your money because you won't get this one especially."
5,Ricky Gervais is a Comic Genius,"Nietzche said that he knew ""best why it is man alone laughs; he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter."" This helps explain why The Office is so hilariously successful. The laughs spring from the crushing mediocrity and alienation of pointless office jobs. This may explain why more people enjoy Series One over Series Two; Series Two takes a much more stark view of office life, skewering the clueless chauvinism, bigotry, and political correctness of office life with exhilarating skill, showing the magnificent self-destruction of David Brent with equal parts gags and pathos. You'll be maniacally laughing with and at David Brent."
3,"Great for 5'6"" or Less","I love this swing, my husband hates it. I am 5' 5"" tall and he is 5' 9"". For some reason, he is unable to find a comfortable position when he uses the swing. I am perfectly happy. For him, the lack of back support is bothersome (it leans too far back). We also received one that leans slightly, but were able to correct this. Overall, I do recommend this swing as it is great looking and has high quality fittings. I do not recommend this swing's stand (purchased separately) as it feels flimsy and rocks a great deal."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book hoping that it would be about environmentalism. Instead it is an autobiography of the author. To make matters worse it is not even a good autobiography. While the author has had an interesting life and many diversified experiences in many fields the book doesn't read well. The author, for instance, will note that he took over a new position and he'll go on for pages and pages about who he hired and how competent they were. However in these pages of lavish praise he tells the reader little, if anything, substantive about what they (or he) were doing or accomplishing. This happened over and over through the book until about two thirds of the way through I just gave up reading it. On the positive side he does convey the distrust that the third world feels towards the western nations on environmental issues and discusses ways and bringing the two together. Unfortunately, the book has too many faults and too few virtues."
4,Showcase for young Yvonne DeCarlo.,"This was probably Yvonne DeCarlo's best chance to show her talents and rare beauty. Excellent film noire genre, and a must see for any fan of either!"
3,Lancaster in an OK Vehicle,"To this film's credit the B & W photography is great, as is, asalways, Miklos Rosza's score, and the story is good. That said, as a modern viewer one has to suspend an incredible amount of disbelief. Let's face it: Burt Lancaster is an icon. He is nobody's fool. In light of all the great work that Lancaster has done (From Here to Eternity, The Sweet Smell Of Success, Atlantic City,etc.) and the image of the strong leading man he attained we are supposed to accept him as a chump here. And this may sound ridiculous, but in my mind I could not accept Lancaster risking life and limb for Yvonne DeCarlo(a.k.a Lily Munster). I'm sure in the 40's the two were on equal footing, but hey, this is 2004."
1,"It would have been great, but...","Unfortunately, there seems to be a ""bad batch"" of these. Like the previous reviewer, my copy was also defective. The CD itself is undamaged - the problem is clearly the recording.Also, the track listing and sequence shown here is not right. Some songs are in a different order, ""Stagger Lee"" and ""Put Your Head On My Shoulder"" are not included, and ""In the Still of the Night"" by the Five Satins is on there instead."
5,"Great sight, great price!","Easy five stars. I used this sight to replace the stock front sight on my Glock 23. I've never been a fan of Glock OEM sights. I blacked out the rear white ""goal post"" on the stock rear sight with a black marker and mounted the HiViz on the front with a little blue Loctite. Standard 3/16 nut driver ground down to fit in the slide works perfect to tighten the screw. Love this setup. It will be my go to set for all my pistols."
2,Anhhh :/,"Nice sight pretty visible in low light conditions but what I really don't like about it is it's frame is plastic. While praticing pulling it from my holster (white hat, maxtuck) the frame of the sight is wearing out, I expected a lil but it's to the point that it's leaving plastic shavings all over my gun and even covering the front sight to where I can't even see the dot it's filled with black plastic shavings. I would advise against."
3,"Nice product, faulty instructions, missing the right installation tool","The sight itself is not bad. Especially the green pipe will really help in acquiring the target fast. Why I gave only 3 stars: The printed instructions say to take a punch and punch the front sight out. THIS IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. You need to use the Glock front sight removal tool, which is like a very slim hex nut driver. Pounding the sight with a punch may or may not lead to scratching, marring or worse. And they do not include an appropriate tool to unscrew that itsy bitsy screw, costing you extra time and money."
4,Tiny pieces!,"I actually bought this item to replace the front sight on my SW Sigma, and it took some intricate dremmel tool work to reduce the lock post to fit the sight hole. Once that was achieved then came the tricky part: fastening the locking screw/bolt into the treading on the insertion post of the sight. With diligence, patience and a little luck it got it fitted and took the pistol to the range. It performed well enough, great sight acquisition as the bright fiberoptic really pops against a typical two dot rear sight. However after about 100 rounds I noticed the sight had sifted about 15 degrees to the left, which lead me go disassemble the pistol to further investigate. The locking bolt had wiggled loose, fortunately I had my Leatherman Squirt on hand and used the needle nose pliers to refasten the screw. Once I returned home I loosened the screw and dabbed a few drops of locktite on the assembly and the sight hasn't budged since.Make sure to use locktite to ensure proper lockdown!"
1,Not Heavy Duty,"These Tarps come in a package marked heavy duty, they ase not heavy duty in any sense of the word. I have a 6x8 that I am replacing that was much heavier and was a standard tarp. If you are looking for sometimg that will last do not buy. Go to Walmart and buy the blue 6x8 tarp for 4.88 and it will be heavier than this tarp guarenteed. I was looking for at least a standard gauge to replace my stantard gauge that I bought at walmart years ago that they don't oarry at the store any longer. In my opinion you can send these back where they came from. On top of that I got charged double for shipping because I ordered 2, thanks for nothing."
2,not heavy duty,"this is not heavy duty, but makes a fine play tent for my daughter, but not what I wanted it for"
3,Misjudged size,My own fault. I'm not good with visualizing sizing so it was smaller than I expected. Good product though and serves its purpose well enough.
1,The information was not specific to the Papillion breed.,"I was disappointed in this book. The very beginning of this book was about Papillions and their history, but as it progressed, the information was just about dogs in general. The information in the latter half of the book was no different than what I had found in all other dog/care dog/training books. I was hoping to find more specific info on the care and training of the Papillion breed."
4,Relatively impressive,"I bought this for my sweetie who swears he's been putting on weight. I'm so glad this T-shirt came in multiple sizes, especially those sizes that we fit us fatties.At first, one might think, ""It's just an old-school Native dude. What's the big deal?"" However, the colors and the details on the shirt are quite impressive. I wish the shirt came in more than just black (that way it would be more wearable in sunnier weather). Still, this was a good buy.This is a nice shirt for guys who want to champion Native American causes or pay tribute to their Native American ancestors."
2,a mixed bag,"as a reasonably sophisticated individual investor, i was hoping for some additional insights over what i already know re: convertibles, metals, hedge funds, etc. --the successes and failures of this book are largely section specific: for example, the chapters on Energy, Distressed Securities and Hedge Funds were insightful and worthwhile, whereas the chapters on Gold and Microcaps were hardly worth reading (i.e. no insights whatsoever). In general, Tremont Advisors did a great job in their sections, and the rest (except the one on Energy) were woefully inadequate.It seems this book was written with a target audience of unsophisticated / non-critical high-net worth individuals in mind...how many of them are out there, hmmm?Proceed with caution."
1,poor,"I bought this because I thought it looked neat. What a cheap piece of junk, save your money I've said enough about the seafood cracker but I had to add words."
5,I don't understand the poor reviews!,"I bought a pack of 4 Space Bags, 2 jumbo and 2 large and they worked beautifully! I have reused them for seasonal clothing, jackets and blankets for two years now. They work for me like they show in the TV ads. Maybe you just need to follow the directions..."
1,Won't hold vacuum,I ordered 5 bags. I filled & vacuumed 3 of them. One of the 3 worked!! I sent them back and I am waiting for refund. I had to pay shipping on the return - save yourself the $$ and just buy a plastic storage box at Target - this won't work!
1,very poor seal design,"I have spent in the last 2 years at least $60.00 in space bags.of the 5 jumbo bags I have purchased only 1 has had a good seal on it. I can only hope this issue will be addressed and redesigned, and I can be a very satisfied customer. I love the product when it works properly, But the frustration when it doesn't is almost too much to handle. I plan to find my receipts and return the defected ones to wal-mart where I purchased them. I think the plastic should be a little heavier gauge material. Also the zipper seal is not closing air tight."
1,Don't waste your money,Air seeps back in. I thought I got a lemon & bought another set of space bags. Still no go. They don't work.
2,I have used this before and love it but..........,"I love this oil and all the french lavender products they carry, however whomever shipped this to me sent me an unsealed bottle with sand in it, so I am afraid to us it."
3,disorganized book,"First I must admit that I hate every book that doesn't have at least one image every two recipes. This book has about 10 images for the entire book.I think the recipes are what some could qualify as simple, but really the good term would be obvious, you could figure it out yourself. Imagine what you would put in a spinach lasagna... Did you guess? lasagna pasta, tomato sauce of some sort, cheese and spinach. A little bit more taste? add onion and garlic and a little bit of dried oregano. Come on! Can't you make it up yourself? The recipes in that book have nothing new at all. Boring.An other thing that infuriates me when I use a cooking book is when it uses prepared food. When a book tells me that I could cook spaghetti and use canned spaghetti sauce, but spice it up with dried italian herbs, I would slap its author with a cooking mitt... And you call that a recipe? I call that a college student meal."
5,Cookbook for the Soul!,This is a great read for anyone that is grappling with their feelings and want God's help to sort things out. The author presents 2 or 3 pages on typical emothional feelings and how we may look to God for support through pertinent Bible passages. Think of this as a Cookbook for the Soul!
1,STAY AWAY!!,"People, do NOT waste your money on this DVD player. It worked decently for about 9 months, then died completely. It fails to recognize any disc whatsoever. Before dying, it was extremely sensitive and very glitchy, plus it would shut itself off if you had it paused for over 3 minutes, and then not remember where the film left off. This is an absolutely TERRIBLE player and I'm sure you can get something more reliable for much cheaper."
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this product about a year and a half ago. I only used it about 10 or so times. Then, one day I pop in a brand new legitimate movie. I shut the thing off to get lunch, and I left the disc in there. When I come back (15 minutes later) I turn it back on, and it can't read the disc I left in it. Simply BS. I have another DVD player, high quality Panasonic one, and I tested the disc in there. To no surprise the disc worked. To make a long story short, I recommend staying away from this product, because it is not even proportional to the price. For around 90 bucks I hoped I would get a decent DVD player. But this is absolute garbage. Buy it if you want it to match your silver TV, but it doesn't account for its main purpose."
4,Very authentic flavors,"This spice paste is a good way to replicate Hot and Sour soup at home, broth and chicken or pork required."
2,Not the best taste and a time waster,"Short on time? Don't like the idea of putting live coals in your mouth? Then this soup is not for you =)- There's nothing in this package except for a thick spicy paste - no mushrooms, no veggies, not even a chicken broth or little pieces of chicken meat. All that you'll have to buy separately and add as you cook.- Maybe I just expected too much from it but that's definitely not the kind of hot&sour; soup I prefer. All you get is red burning lips and a feeling that you should probably give the rest 11 bags to your friends (maybe some of them will be able to feel any taste except the burn).- My personal choice is Kikomn Egg Hot and Sour Soup - probably the most underrated on the Amazon, but it's really the best tasting one.- The price is good though =) Two stars for that."
2,MUCH SHORTER THAN INDICATED,"THE BOX INDICATES THE APPROXIMATE RUNNING TIME IS 50 MINUTES. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT IN SLOW MOTION. THE ACTUAL RUNNING TIME IS CLOSER TO 25 MINUTES. THERE IS SOME GOOD FACTUAL CONTENT IN THIS ONE THAT I DID NOT SEE IN OTHER VIDEOS OR BOOKS, BUT VERY LITTLE. I WOULD RATHER RECOMMEND THE VIDEO ""A CAREGIVERS GUIDE TO ALZHEIMERS"" OR ""SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE"""
5,"Wow, Winger Lives!","I'm so happy Winger decided to release a demo anthology instead of a greatest hits collection. It's been over a year now, and hardly a day goes by that I don't listen to a few songs from this album. In fact, this is the album that got me excited about their last studio album, IV.If you ever liked Winger, you will love this one. Pick it up while it's still in print!"
3,another one for the saga,"I`ve been playing medal of honor games since the first one appeared on PS, this is just another one for the saga with wii motion controls obviously but I didn`t enjoy they game that much. Besides it`s a very short game but fun tho. Anyway if you want a WWII FPS game for the wii Call Of Duty 3 is a lot better."
4,"For a Wii game, not bad at all","I had really high expectations for this game, and I'm reasonably impressed with it. The graphics are decent considering its a wii game. the single player is fun, but short. Reasonably challanging also. The levels however in multiplayer, are extremely small. Sadly to say, there aren't any AI bots, or online features, or even Co-op. If nintendo could have put a little more effort into improving those 3 things, and with even slightly better graphics, this game would sell like crazy. Overall, it is probably one of the best games so far to be released on the wii."
1,Medal Of Honor-Vanguard,"As first person Shooter games go, MOH is not too bad. It is a bit easier than some of the other EA games such as the Battle Field series. You are limited in strategies and weapons available. Ammunition is in short supply for much of the game which adds a touch or realism to the game I suppose.The player gets to participate in the 82nd Air Borne operations in the European theater during WWII much While at times challenging, it lacks save points. If you don't complete an operation or have to quiit, you loose all the medals and ground you have covered up to that point. It makes an operation one long and tedious task. Other EA games function better."
2,"Half a game, really...","Medal of Honor has been steadily going down hill since Frontline. This game is still fun with the wii remote, but it is way too short and probably not worth more than a rental. Go with Call of Duty 3 instead."
4,Medal Of Honor,"Bought the game for my uncle, not sure how much hes played it but i do know that he hasnt complained at all about it"
4,coolieo,"We got this product as a gift. This is a good game. The story line is okay, and the multiplayer is fine. The things that I don't like as much is that the game does not have wifi. The multiplayer doesn't have much options. Overall, this is an okay game."
2,Mediocre game at best,"I borrowed this game from a friend and basically beat it in two days. It wasn't much fun, all the objectives I think any one who has played Call of Duty 1,2, or 3 has done(or any ww2 game for that matter), and the multiplayer is very limited. The controls were fair but not like Metroid Prime and the graphics were ok at best. In short buy Medal of Honor heroes 2, you miss out on the ohhhhhh so fun air drops (not really) but it's the classic me vs. Nazi Germany kinda feel. Much better game."
2,Too little for the $,"If you can find this for $20, go for it. The graphic and gameplay are fun for that price. At $49.99, it's too short and too easy. I hope MOH Heroes 2 won't be so bad, but I'll be waiting for the first reviews to come in."
2,Really short and boring game.,"I bought this game today thinking it would be awesome. Turns out, it's the worst Wii game I've played. It only took me about 4-5 hours to beat and it was boring the whole way through. I played through Red Steel, which was waaay more fun than this. If you want a first person shooter for the Wii, this isn't it."
4,Medal of Honor: Vanguard,"Not a bad game if you pay less then $20. I really enjoyed MoH: Allied Assualt on PC and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare on Wii, so I thought I get this. The controls on the Wii are not as easy to use (No Zapper) but it's fun none the less. Enough action to make it interesting but if you don't do it your ""company"" will just wait for you. They're not much help. My 8 y/o granddaughter likes a lot!"
5,They Don't Make Comedy Like This Anymore,"I absolutely adore Martin! He is one of the only tv comedic actors with the ability to make my face and stomach sore from laughing so damn hard! I will admit that in later years I didn't find the program as entertaining, but for sheer zaniness and good time hilarity, Martin is a Must. P.S. My favorite Martin characters are ""Mama Payne"", ""Jerome the 70s style Playa"" and ""Otis, the grizzled security guard."" Come on with Season Two!"
5,Long Awaited and Doesn't Disappoint,"Like everyone is saying, it is about time. This season is full of classic episodes and also has all the great characters including my favorite, Dragonfly Jones. I really hope HBO decides to continue releasing the other seasons. I watch an episode and my day gets a little brighter. If you have never watched Martin, I suggest you give it a look. Personally, this is my favorite show of all time."
5,It's About Time: WHAAAAT'S UP!,"Martin Lawrence on DVD Finally, I thought it was gonig to take an act of Congress to get this done. This is my favorite sit-com of all time. It's probably all the wacky characters that make it great. Characters of who remind us of some real people we all know.The cast is perfectly molded on the friendship/chemistry level; and you really feel that the characters are for real, for real. It's knid of like looking out across your balcony and seeing all the zannyness; but on television. I still remember Martin from ""What's Happening Now"" when he played a waiter; and I'm still waiting for that DVD mannn! Overall great DVD collection piece---just a little less booty for Shenaynay please."
5,"Whassup, whassup, WHASSUP!!!!","Man! It's about time!! News of this one finally being released is great! This one is so anticipated, I'm sure folks will put aside some of their holiday shopping bucks to get this one! Everyone I know still enjoys the repeats of ""Martin"" on their local TV stations, or TV-One Cable network. One of those rare shows that even leave you laughing even after repeat viewings. Count me amongst the many who are glad it's finally getting its' due. Hopefully the successive season releases won't take nearly as long to be issued on DVD!"
5,"Martin, I'm your man...","Waiting for the next 2 seasons to come out, I had been waiting for this DVD and the second season to come out for years. I actually got cable so I can watch Martin, but since I have my dvds, really don't need the cable :)The only thing is I dont think the episodes are in order, I could be wrong, and in the Episode that Cole was living with Martin, I remembered Cole was clipping his toenails and one of the hit Gina in the head. I also remember when Martin and Gina got into a fight,she said something about his mommas biscuits, that may have been left out too. But besides all of that. the show is awesome, I was also impressed with how quick it got here. It took about 4 days to get here. I actually have watched all of the first and second season, it took about a week to watch it, but it was the bome."
5,Martin,"Finally- after all of these years, one of my favorite television shows has been made available on DVD. I couldn't stop laughing as Martin and his crew go through their every day lives. I even know the words of some of the episodes. My only question is... When is season 2 coming out?"
5,YES!! Finally! its about time!! MAAAARTIIIIIIN!! Wassup! Wassup!!,"Words cannot explain how much I love this show. Me and people at work and school use to talk about this all the time, wondering why it was not released yet. And look, my dream finally came through for the better. Martin the first season is out.Those people over at FOX would of dropped the ball big time if they hadnt have released this after all these year. Now we want to see Season 2,3,4, and 5. I could watch this over and over."
5,THE BEST,"Martin omg omg What more Can I say...it was great reliving those memories my childhood waiting to watch Martin w/ my cousin My Fav. Character Jerome, ""JEROME IN THE HOUSE"" AND fAVORITE EPISode had to b Break up part 3 and Definately Meet the parents, Im probably going to b the same way...lmfao Good stuff now waiting for SEASON 2...Plz bring it out Soon"
5,You Go Boy!,"Martin is the sitcom that I searched the internet for over and over again. When I found that Amazon had it, I was elated. Season 1 was the funniest season on Martin, but I will own the remainder seasons as they become available!"
5,"WAZZZUUP, WAZZZUPPP!!","know u know everyone's been waitin for this dvd (otha reviewers), i know i have for a verrry long time. What i'm wondering is what took so long to make the collection? every body i know loves this show and would without a doubt buy the dvd! My mom loves it! for a while they wouyld show reruns in the morning on tnt or one of then channels and you know i would always wake up early to watch it...i was so dissapointed when they stopped giving reruns...and since i have'nt found a channel that shows reruns, so i can't wait. I think this is the best African American comedic show ever!! Young and old love it. BUY IT and you won't stop laughing!"
5,WHUZZ UP!!!!!!!,Its just the best comedy series ever and this season was just sweet man. I would give it ten stars instead of five stars. Just buy it man trust me the things you will see and hear will bring you to tears of joy.
4,Martin is a good show by dontrell bradley,Martin I want Martin season 5 I am going to get that soon because I like Martin and I late that Martin and Gina had a problem so that below the show off.
4,mar----in!,"great series!!brings back some good memories!! its pretty weird how u look at life and things differently as u get older. this show came out when i was a freshman in college. while i still found it funny i noticed a lot more things now that im older than i did back then.anyways, ill only be purchasing this season of martin only. the 2nd season and the remaining seasons, i didnt find too funny."
5,The Great Martin Lawrence- A genuis ahead of his time.,"Martin was truly a talent and a visionary comedian. His talent for mimicry far exceeded his peers. He was a visionary in that he could create all kinds of characters and make people laugh. He also had break out artist from the world of Rap, Hip Hop, and Blues. If you want to see most of today's rappers in there early stages this was the show to do it. Martin Lawrence was the show to watch in the first decade of the ninety's. If I was having a really bad day at work I would go home and watch Martin on Youtube and get my laugh on. And it would make any situation I was working through on the job, much better. The saying ""Laughter is the best medicine"" is so true and this show could make you laugh til you cried.Martin Lawrence was truly a genuis who was truly ahead of his time. If you really want to know how people feel about Martin as a comedian, read the postings on YOUTUBE."
5,Funnyman Martin!,I'm so glad this show finally made it to DVD! It was one of the funniest shows on TV. I love all the characters - especially Sha na na! Enjoy!
5,You Go Boy...,"I absolutely loved this sitcom. Its about time that the DVD series came out. I just hope that the rest of the seasons come out. A lot of black sitcoms come out but the rest of the seasons aren't released, so I really hope it doesn't happen here. The sitcom was well-received from both white and black audiences."
5,Cinderella Rocks,We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays.
5,Cinderella DVD,"I've been looking for this video in stores for a long time and never found it. I watched this every year on TV as a child - so, when I found Amazon had it, I bought it for myself for my 51st birthday. I guess you're never too old for a good fairy tale!"
5,"""Impossible. . .things are happening every day!""","Wow, some productions become the entertainment church of the soul, and this one is no exeption.Who can resist the story of a young non-regal born lass, destined to become an inhouse maid by her horrible wicked ancestors from her kind father's desolved marriage from his death, to eventually become royal princess! It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convincing cry in ""her own little corner.""Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in ""The Wizard Of Oz"" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother. The prince is fortunitely portrayed here, as not only handsome and dashing, but kind, considerate, and ""in love.""The musical score almost speaks for itself in catchy memorable tunes, and lyrics. And it ends with those very words, in my review heading!"
1,Cinderella DVD disapointing,The quality of this DVD is HORRIBLE!! It is blurry and fuzzy....watching it on my large wide screen tv shows the flaws even more. I can't believe how poor the quality of this DVD is. Other reviews have said the VHS is better quality than this but I will not waste my money after seeing this version. I love this movie but can't believe they even put a movie on DVD that looks as bad as this one does.
1,Bad Experience,"It has at least 3 places where it freezes and skips too many scenes...IT IS DAMAGED! The condition I ordered was 'very good' and it is NOT. I bought it because of how much I loved the movie as a child and wanted to add it to my collection...but it is too damaged. I paid $32.97 total and I am NOT at all satisified with the purchase. I followed the steps to get a refund, but I cannot even get a response--let alone a refund. I will never order movies this way again. Once sold...they don't know you! False Advertising."
4,Rodgers & Hammersten's Cinderella,"The DVD was new as promise, and I was very satisfied with the delivery time the next day."
5,Cinderella,Just the Movie that was on TV when I was a kid! Was so glad to see it again! Great story!
5,I loved it! a simple but beautiful story brought home!,"I have always loved the cinderella story-yet, this one remains etched in my mind since childhood. Lesly anne Warren's performance has inspired generations of castaways to believe in themselves, to soar beyond their dreams-and make a new world. The touching moments with the prince restore a lost respect for honest romance, and set the stage for the two young lovers' future adventure. If you've seen the rest, now see the best version ever!"
5,We are all princesses ...,"As simple as the staging was, the special effects and even the costumes, this classic Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderella is how I will always remember Cinderella. When I popped this VHS into the machine, I was immediately taken back to sitting in front of my televsion (which was only black and white) and watching it with my sisters and mother. How we'd make crowns of construction paper and decorate them. Sometimes our mom would let us put on a party dress while we watched it as well.Nothing like the original. Looking forward to seeing the Broadway production in NYC this Spring."
5,Please- Please re-release my favorite version of Cinderella!,"(since my cousin doesn't have access to the www I am writing this for her)I introduced my 2 1/2 year old daughter to my favorite version of Cinderella starring Lesley Ann Warren.Watching it with her brought back such good memories,and I was sad to learn it is not available for purchase. More importantly, my daughter was heart broken. She always cries as it ends....""it's over, it's over...."" It is a struggle to return it to the video store. My daughter refers to this version as, ""the new Cinderella"". Dawn B."
3,DVD Release for Julie Andrews Version,PBS will release the original Cinderella (1957) with Julie Andrews on the 7th December 2004 on both the DVD and VHS. There is absolutely no one comparable to Julie Andrews and I will definately preorder one. I'm saving the five stars for Julie Andrews.
2,Poor Cinderella,"For some reason, I thought when Amazon advertised a product as ""new"", that meant it was actually NEW!I Nice bit of color copying on the cover, but some loose shrink-wrap was my first big hint that someone had just made a copy and sold it for new. I thought I should check out my suspicions before I gave it as a gift and sure enough - SKIP! This guy who had it must've laughed all the way to the bank! Too bad it's Amazon's reputation that's suffered this time!"
2,Missing Pieces,What is the point of a full screen version?We are missing 30% of the picture.This is equivalent to vandalising a work of art.
2,Wooden!,"I saw a regional theater production of Cinderella, then bought the VHS to relive the great show, and was very disappointed. Reading the other reviews, and realizing how well-known this 1964 version is, I realize I must be in the minority, but I really do not think it is a good production. I read somewhere that though the original tapes for the 1957 Julie Andrews version were lost, some sort of version does exist. I wonder if it will ever be released. I have that CD, and recommend it highly.(2006 update to this 2002 review: 1957 version now available on DVD; rather a dated TV production, but Julie Andrews shines!)"
2,"Wow, in a Bad Way","This production of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is cringeworthy at best. I understand this was a television movie, but they couldn't at least choose good actors and provide a better set? Cinderella acts and sounds like a complete ditz, all starry-eyed and breathless voice. It's partly the fault of the camera-work though. Every 10 seconds and it's an extreme close-up of Cinderella's face. It's frightening. I love the music and this musical, but if it's not well-acted or well-sung, it's not enjoyable for me. I've only heard the Julie Andrews version in soundtrack form, and already that one is 100X better. There's none of the pleasant, exciting, and lovely performances of the original cast. This version has no energy. The exception is the Prince and his parents the King and Queen; they weren't bad. But the rest of the show is the epitome of cheesiness - which could have been avoided if feeling and energy were put into the performances, even despite the terrible sets."
2,Against Julie Andrews this version is just not good.,"I remember trying to watch this several times over the years and never could.(Even as a kid I thought this was very dull.) The Brandy version was more watchable but NOTHING compares to the Julie Andrews version.This cast is the worst of the three versions, Stuart Damon is laughable as the Prince and Leslie Ann Warren who've I've enjoyed in so many other shows is soo miscast. Yuck..Wait for the 1950's cast DVD or buy the recently remastered CD.Much mroe worth your money."
4,Leslie Ann Warren in Cinderella,"A fun walk down memory lane. The special effects are very cheesy, but the magic is still there. Thoroughly enjoyed by 3 generations of girls!"
5,Wonderful for all!,I bought this movie for my 10 year old hoping she would like it. She absolutely loved it as well as I did. Was well worth the money!
5,Great Movie,Loved this movie--had a copy in VHS which broke so I was thrilled to get it in DVD format. If you're a Cinderella fan don't miss this one--kids will love it too.
2,There's a reason the good reviews are for the VHS version,"I have never heard such dreadful sound quality on a DVD as on this one. What a terrible thing to have done to a wonderful Rodgers and Hammerstein score. And what an insult to fans of this best-of-all-the-""Cinderellas"" who've been waiting so long to see this on DVD. Some tone-deaf ninny should get canned for this."
4,Still love it after all these years!,"I was excited to finally see this production again after watching it every year when it came on TV in the 60's. Sure it's dated but the songs are still wonderful (as is the Prince's smile). I loved it as a child and still do.My children of course thought some of the dialogue and the flying pumpkin coach were pretty cheezy (okay, I agree) - but they still watched it a second time. My daughter has now acquired the sheet music for ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and is learning to play it on the piano. Like the story of Cinderella itself, the songs are timeless.If you are a fan of Rogers and Hammerstein's other musicals you'll love this too. But keep an eye on Cinderella's slipper when she bolts from the ball - it's already off her foot and sitting on the top of the stairs outside before she even gets there!"
5,FAVORITE MOVIE,THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO IN THE WHOLE WORLD I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT JO VAN FLEET REALLY MADE THE MOVIE FOR ME AND LESLEY ANN WARREN AND STUART DAMON ARE THE PREFECT PRINCE AND HIS PRINCESS WHO WOULD THOUGHT YEARS LATER HE WOULD PLAY ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE MEN ON DAYTIME SOAP OPERA.ALSO ANOTHER REASON IS BECAUSE MY GRANDMOTHER AND HER BEST FRIEND WERE NAMED BELIEVE IT NOT CINDERELLA I KID YOU NOT IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAS SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY NAMED CINDERELLA SEND A REVIEW IT WILL BE GREAT READING
3,"Amazing Film, Horrendous Picture Quality DVD","I bought this yesterday (...) and I was thrilled to get my hands on it. I, like many of you have grown up with this enchanting version of the classic fairy tale. But the DVD picture is full of blurriness, lacking a lot of clarity, random lines cross the screen throughout, and it looks like a poor quality VHS that was recorded from TV 15 years ago. The sound is okay, but I'm just happy enough to be able to own this, so I try to look over the many picture flaws of the DVD while watching it. If you love this film, you must buy it, but be warned, it is nowhere near the capabalities of DVD or even a regular VHS."
5,this is the best Cinderella ever made!!,If you have never seen this you are missing a great masterpiece!! this is the Cinderella I grew up on!!a great choice for all ages!
3,"Okay version, but nothing on the 1957 version with Julie Andrews","This is an okay version of the R&H television musical written in the late 1950s for Julie Andrews, but doesn't come anywhere close to the magic of the original. One nice thing about it, though, is that we get treated to a musical number that was cut from South Pacific -- ""Loneliness Of Evening"" -- and it seems to work just fine in the framework of the plot. One disappointing cut is ""Your Majesties"", a fun number for the King and Queen. The reasoning behind this seems to be that the director was going for a less comic royal couple. Another nice addition is the extended ""Stepsisters' Lament""."
4,THe songs made the movie,Seeing this movie nearly 40 years later made me laugh at the cheap backdrop and lack of set decor but the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein made you completely forget how cheaply it was made.
5,I agree - Why??,"I love this movie and would make my husband watch it even though he hates musicals, but I just...can't...afford...it! Why is it still so expensive??? There is obviously still a big market for this version over the newer one."
1,Cinderella dvd,Cinderella DVDNever have i seen such a poor transfer to dvd. Picture quality is appauling. out of focus / colour runs .
2,Sinful DVD,"Please STOP ! Someone must have stayed awake and thought long and hard for ways to ruin this dvd. BUY THE VHS version...THAT picture is clear and the sound is great ! The dvd is WAY out of focus, and the sound comes from a tin can and a string !How utterly disappointing !"
5,Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965),What a delight that this special version of Cinderella has been re-released! I can still remember 1969 at the age of 5- the first year I saw this production on television - how wonderful it was. I waited anxiously every year to see it again on television. This is a must see for any little girl. The Brandy version (other than Whitney Houston's lovely voice) cannot come close to the original!
5,Classic,"When I was a kid, once a year, this movie would play on TV. Being of a musical bent, I annoyed everyone by singing along. I still sing along, but now I don't care what people think! It's a classic movie and I love seeing Stuart Damon and Leslie Ann Warren young and beautiful. Even tho I appreciate good singing, my favorite song in the movie is performed by the two worst singers in the bunch - ""The Stepsisters' Lament"". This movie is technically cheezy, overly sentimental, cheaply produced....and I love every second of it."
5,One of my all time favorite movies,"I think it is a shame that you cannot buy this movie retail anywhere! It is a classic. I may only be 14, but I know a wonderful movie when I see one. Brandy does NOT do the story of Cinderella justice!! We need Leslie Ann Warren!!"
5,"Enchanting and graceful, she lives on in my heart!","As a 40 year old viewer, I remember vividly this enchanting and lively version of this classic tale. I still remember the first time watching this on TV as a first grader. Lesley Ann Warren is an average girl who is tranformed into a lovely princess. As a child I felt that if you wanted something bad enough, you had to keep believing in it. I still do, and wanted to share this movie with my 10 year old daughter. Please, please, release it again."
5,Purchased this on Ebay,"As a child, I loved this movie. CBS showed it once a year and I remember that they showed it on Saturday night. I was in love with Leslie Ann Warren. My daughter is 5 years old and I've told her many times about how she'd like this movie. Well, when I saw it on Ebay, I jumped at the chance to get it. We watched it last night and my daughter loved it. They should re-release this gem.Henry"
5,The movie that brought me back to my childhood,Every year as a child I anxiously awaited for the network to advertise when they would play this movie. I love the music and of course the story is a classic. It's a favorite of mine.
5,The Best Movie Ever Made !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is 10 times better then the Disney version. Everything from its detail of the century to the singing and wardrobe. Lesley Ann Warren and The Prince which went on to play a part on General Hospital (which I originally recognize as the Prince in Cinderella) were so compatible as far as the movie. Please re-release this version of Cinderella by Rogers & Hammerstein.
1,Rip Off on Price,I found this DVD in multiple locations for $14.95. Don't be ripped off because one of the stars passed away...
1,Poor quality,"The DVD jacket states ""digitally remastered"". This is the poorest quality image and sound. It appears worse than the original television version. The image is grainy and the audio does not sync with the image.Very disappointing for a truly wonderful classic version of Cinderella. Do not bother purchasing."
2,Another book about Johnny Cash,"I had to think about how many stars to give this one. I've read numerous other books on the same subject, and this, I'm afraid, is not one of the better ones, but that is my opinion. For the fan, it has a certain reference value, detailing the Carter family history for instance, but the whole truth, as we now know it, is not told, by Peggy Knight, who it appears remains a faithful and trusted friend to Johnny and June. If you'ra a fan, you'll want this for your collection, if you want to find out all about the world of Johnny Cash, Amazon have a selection of books where you will find more detailed information."
1,All she was after is fame and glory,"I can't understand how someone who lived with the Cash's 33 yrs.and put down just about everyone, except June, Johnny, Maybelle and expecially herself. You would think she was the queen of sheba. The book is more about her then the Cash family. I detected she didn't like the kids at all. All she could brag about was the money they would give her or prized posessions. How they bought her stuff all the time. I could see why John Carter Cash wanted her out of the house. She probably expected to get the whole Cash fortune."
4,Good book with info,"When i first got my kerry blue, there were no books about his breed except for this one. When i started reading it, it gave me alot of information to help me breed my dog, train him, and make him happy. i also learned more about his history! Great book! Although, i thought that alot of details were missing, so if you want to buy this book to get a good idea on how to treat/know more about kerries, i highly recommend this book!! :-)"
1,Not Worth the money,"I was not impressed by this book. It starts out with a nice history about the breed, but everything else is very generic for any breed. It is a nice overall beginner dog book, but not worth it if you want to learn more of this unique breed."
5,Fantastic Speakers!!!,"I've had these speakers for only a single day and I've been completely blown away by the quality of the sound and the craftmanship of these speakers. First of all, the finish is wonderfully smooth and elegant looking. I am suprised by how well designed these speakers are for the price. Sound quality is exceptional: far superior to similiar speakers by Infinity or Polk Audio. Bass is excellent for speakers of this size: tight and controlled without being overpowering. The treble and midrange is well-balanced with great seperation of sound. Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of these speakers. These speakers are my first Cambridge Soundworks purchase and I'm sure to be a repeat customer in the future."
2,"Too much information on the ""proper"" diet for dogs","About a forth of the book explains proper nutrition for dogs. The author recommends cooking ""human"" foods for your dog. If I followed the diet recommended in the book, my dogs would be eating better than I do!!Amy""I'd be happy to have my biography be the stories of my dogs. To me, to live without dogs would mean accepting a form of blindness."" - Thomas McGuane"
2,Ordinary at best,"The title of the book is a clever hook. Some information is good but the presentation is distracting. To many subjects are addressed in a cursory way.The writer rambles and injects odd subjects like finding your power through breath, making a fist with your face, yoga, and mindstuffs.I'm all for breathing but making a fist with your face and Mindstuff?There are exceptionally well written dog training books, but this is not one of them one.Check out the reviews for books by Pat Miller. The training experience level of the reviewers themselves is noteworthy."
2,Not much new information,"The attitude of the author was a little scary to me. He acted as if most people beat their dogs, and this book would teach you how to give your dogs treats and love instead of hitting him/her to get the behaviour you want. Maybe some people need to hear that message, but it seems obvious to me. I didn't learn anything new."
1,wrong book was sent,"I orderedThe dog WhispererA compassionate non violent approach to dog trainingI got a book on origami, Joyful Origami BoxesI got the wrong book,I did not order the book I received fromGreen earth books shipped from Portland Oregon5103 d nw #103auborn 98001"
1,Disappointment,I read Cesar Millan's book and thought that this bood would be similiar in information and instruction. I was completely wrong. I skimmed over every section because each section was so basic. The teaching method is completely different from Millan's and therefore a complete waste of money.
1,Worst Dog Training Book I've Read,"I've been reading numerous dog training books lately and I have to say that this is by far the worst one. I recommend the book ""The Other End of the Leash"" or ""Cesar's Way."" Even ""The Dog's Mind"" had more information on training then this one did."
3,practical,"is not from the TV show, but gives good advice on diet, training techniques, and ways to improve your own behavior when training your doga sincere effort to show a way to train a dog without smacking on the nose with a newspaper or yanking its leash"
2,"Very limited, impractical, ""all positive""","Read through the entire book a few months ago, didn't like most of what it said, and threw it in the closet. Does not give enough options for solid obedience or behavior issues, the advice that is given is, in my opinion, not going to work out well with most dogs. Certainly didn't work with my dogs. Book is slanted towards ""all positive type"" training, and not a balanced method including corrections."
1,This book has half of the equation,"This book fails to take into account that treats and rewards are only part of the equation for learning. Most of the good manners we want our dogs to learn can be taught by what we reward and what we ignore, but not all!I have watched mother dogs interact with their puppies many times, and in addition to playing, licking, grooming and affection, she will also use strong body language, a lift of the lip to show teeth, a growl, a nip or pinning the puppy when appropriate. There ARE times when it is appropriate to use these techniques also, and using both rewards and consequences is what produces a well balanced dogs that are a pleasure to have around. Paul's book does not address this."
2,"I really, REALLY did not like this book...","For some odd reason, this book just irritated me. First is its attitude that every other training method, particularly those involving compulsion, are cruel. They are not, what is cruel is training the dog in a fashion that gives it little respect for the owner. Also, in the beginning the author describes an out-of-body experience he had. What the heck does that have to do with dog training? It kind of set the tone for the entire book. I gave it two stars because the training method WOULD work for a submissive dog not given to challenging his owner's authority. Save your money for a better book!"
1,almost worthless dvd,"I ordered this dvd with high hopes that it would show me some real, specific, detailed training I could use with my dog; there was very little of it contained in the dvd. It was very general, not detailed, not lengthy enough to show me how to train my dog. The cartoon of a cave man first discovering a dog... what was that all about ? fluff. filler. The breathing ? not for the dog but for the human trainer .... geeezzz louezeee ! This ""original dog whisperer"" may be a great dog trainer if you work with him one-on-one with your pet, but via a dvd.... don't waste your money or your time as I have done; invest in a dog obedience class and get hands on, in person training - it will cost you more but your money will be much better spent than to buy this sorry dvd."
2,NOT the Cesar Millan Dog Whisperer!,"Note that this video has nothing to do with Cesar Millan's television show on the National Geographic Channel called ""The Dog Whisperer""The DVD teaches the most basic dog commands, and is ok.But if you want books or DVDs related to Cesar Millan, this item has nothing do with him! It is a different author, teaching altogether different things, writing before the television show was on the air."
3,Little long winded,"Was looking for a quick read, but this went into a lot of other subjects and minutia."
1,"Not all bad, but pretty ""Earthy-crunchy""","The basic premise in this book is good - you don't need to punish your dog to train her, but it is a little off the wall sometimes. For example, the author suggests that your should play music for your dog while you are out of the house and leaving her alone (good suggestion), but then goes on to say that the best type of music to play is New Age. It also suggests not buying prepared food for your dog, instead feeding her raw food which is the only type to contain ""life energy"". I love my pets, but all of this goes a little too far for me. the only reason I don't send this book back is because it only cost $8 to begin with and would cost me $3 to send it back. For $5 I'll keep it and try to get past the tree hugging."
2,good for teaching commands but leave the eastern philosophy out of it,"I agree wholeheartedly with the author's approach of non-violent training but the whole communicating with your dog using 'direct knowledge' is an Eastern load of whooey. If you start on p 106 with the definitions of classical conditioning, counter-conditioning and operant conditioning and go to the end of the book. You've got a really good book on training your dog. I found the first 105 pages very difficult to stomach as he refers to various 'studies' to prove his points but never gives a citation so you can read the study yourself. This is then mixed with the various New Age and Yogic philosophies that he expouses. If you don't agree with these views of life you can easily bypass the first 105 pages and have a great dog training book."
1,Waist of money,"First of all I must have been to quick to make this purchase becuase I thought it was ""The"" Dog Whisperer (Ceaser Millan), but it's not. I didn't, however, want to be turned off before I even saw it. I thought, maybe this guy could tell me a couple things. Well, he can't. The video has a few chapters and are approx.1-2 minutes long. I don't know what to tell you it even covers. To say it's a ""BASIC"" DVD is giving it too much credit. And the ""cute"" little animated video it braggs about is 25 seconds long."
1,"Not THE Dog Whisperer,Cesar Millan!","I quickly ordered this book assuming it was written by Cesar Millan. Pretty shameless for this author to use the title ""The Dog Whisperer"" and using a similar dustjacket to promote sales by associating himself with the well-known Cesar Millan. Alas, my mistake for ordering in a rush - like a fly caught in a Venus Fly Trap. I returned the book at my expense."
1,dog whisperer...,"Very dry ,slow book, not worth reading. Amazon didn't really make it obvious that this is not cesar milan, dog whisperer. Not recommended at all, returned already."
1,Dog Whisperer,He is not the REAL Dog Whisperer-! I ordered it in error. I meant to order Caesar Milan (which I finally did) who is phenomenal!
3,"Good, ""but"". . .","I beame impatient with the author's section on how to relax. It sounded as though this was an issue he had struggled with in his own life and assumed evryone else does, too. I also bought ""The Dog Listener"" and found it better written, more interesting, and more helpful. Dog Whisperer was good,but some others are better."
1,The Dog Whisperer by Paul Owens,"If you would like to read about relaxation exercises, do breathing exercises, hear about holistic medicines, learn to make your own dog food, read of the authors childhood illnesses and how he beat his cigarette addiction, plus dealing with your dogs stress levels, this is the book for you. If you simply want to learn how to train your dog, skip this one. I read to page 139 before the lessons even began and then it really bogged down. It is a catchy title but a lame book. Save your money, I wish I had."
5,wonderful book!,"This book is wonderful, i love the fact that it is loving your dog training.... everyone should use this approach to training their dogs."
5,This method really works!!!,"I've used the choke collar method of dog training. Sure, it works but my pet is my companion and I don't usually choke my friends. I heard about Paul Owen's method and bought his book. Intrigued, and living in the Los Angeles area, I signed up for his class. I am getting results QUICKER and with less stress on myself and my pet. My dog loves to go to class! This book is fantastic and so is Paul Owens. It's a shame that so many dogs are still being ""trained"" using choking or any other intimidating method. Anyone interested in training their dog should buy this book. And, if you live in Los Angeles, take his class. Paul is fantastic (and entertaining) and his method really works! As he says, this same method works well on children and spouses."
2,A good book for those who think dogs are their children,"The problem with this type of approach is that your companion now becomes your ruler. Dogs don't have to be mistreated nor do they have to be coddled like royalty with bribes and adoring phrases. Save the treats and praise for tricks, not for establishing boundaries and basic rules of appropriate behavior."
2,Some Good Training Concepts But...,"This book has some good concepts on training but nothing that I have not seen elsewhere. A few of the reasons for the low rating are the extra chapters in learning to breath, and how to speak dog. If I want to learn how to do meditation breathing I will buy a new age book. Also the diets recommended in this book for your dog are for those who have a 6 figure income and an organic grocery store available to them. The author(s) also assume that you do not have to work to have this income based on the recommended daily routine for caring for your dog. I also was misled by the title thinking that this was the Dog Whisperer from the television show; it is not. I found this out after I bought the book and I finally got to see the show. What an injustice this book does to his television shows' name. I do not recommend this book."
4,"Good book - easy to read, easy to understand","If you want to train your dog (at whatever age) - read this book ... offers alternative training methods to overcome various common training issues and doggie problems ...No leash tugging, no choke/slip chains ... no punishment ... just a sense of humour ... good breathing ... some treats (not bribes, but rewards) and a clicker will do ...This is an awfully useful book to have around any house with pets (even works on cats) ...While not strictly necessary ... will suggest that the reader also get Karen Pryor's 'Don't Shoot the Dog' ... these 2 books compliment each other well. Ms. Prypor's book will provide insight and better understanding of the theory behind positive reinforcement ...These training methods work ... really!When applied correctly, the methods not just work but work fast ... we trained our Labrador to give 'high fives' in less than 5 minutes ... the clicker is amazing ... now if I can only get it to work on humans!"
3,Queer quintet,"Douglas strikes some interesting notes along the way of this classically-inflected experimental jazz, but as usual a majority feels overwrought and undercooked at the same time- compositionally floundering, around occasional brilliance, under fused pretense."
3,"Stock 5.25"" replacement bracket","These are 5.25"" stock speaker replacement bracket, don't buy this if you're planning on using 6.5"", I thought these are for 6.5"" speaker adapter."
5,This system is undeniably the best $40 system money can buy,I'v owned this speaker system for 2yrs now and it hasn't quit on me yet! Great sound for a great price. If your looking for a 2 speaker system for your computer than look no further. I'v blared these speakers for hours at a time and they don't blow! The sound quality is crisp and clear and with plenty of bass. Great for gameing and mp3's
5,Haven't recieved it,"It's been about 10 days since I made my order, stil no reply! I really love these speakers, played with them at best buy. Anyone else had this problem?"
4,"Great Product, but","I have bought a multiple of this item in different colors. The only thing that I might change is the thickness or perceived sturdiness of the waist band. It seems rather flimsy, but time will tell. The crotch band is great in the Lycra(no material change to create chaffing). It is a good value at the ""sale"" price and comfortable. If you need a lot of support this probably isn't for you, but try one."
4,Lycra G-String,Form fitting and snug the color pops against the skin and shows the promise of what it's packing snugly in comfort the strings tight but not too tight
3,novelty g-string,"item was as described and shipped fast, the only complaint i have is it should have been marked as a novelty item. this is not practical for everyday wear but rather for bedroom play"
3,Mixed up.,"I tried to order 2 of what was pictured, but when I received them, 2 times, they were NOT like the picture showed! I wanted the blade like in the picture, not the newer one with a ""safer"" blade. I have a ""safer"" blade peeler of a dif't brand and it doesn't work. I ended up going to ebay and bought a ""Vintage"" Progressive peeler. When you have a few bushels of apples to peel you want one that works! Amazon was gracious in the returns and giving me a refund (even though they didn't probably understand my reasoning?!!)The mix up won't keep me from shopping Amazon again. I just learned I was looking for a hard item to find!"
3,Apple peeler corer slicer,"It's pretty good, but the slices are not as thin as I would want them. (I have an older device -- which is broken and apparently no longer made -- that sliced thinner and had a sharper peeler.)Of the devices currently available, this one is one of the better ones I have tried."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"After reading many of the above reviews I decided to purchase this model today. I set it up and we were excited to make apple crisp for dessert. Into our 4th apple the ""cast iron"" portion of the crank handle snapped off in my son's hand, leaving behind a very sharp edge. My experience has been that cast iron lasts a generation or more, not 3.5 apples. I will take this back and find one that is made in America with some real quality. Learned my lesson!"
1,Corer/Slicer blade bends rather than cutting,"The corer/slicer blade is such low quality that it bends instead of cutting the apple. Then when it can't bend farther and starts cutting the apple, the alignment is off and it doesn't core right. Also, my counter is 2 inches thick and it wouldn't fit. I had to attach it to my built in cutting board. I'm returning it."
1,Terrible,We used if for four apples before the screw that the turning arm connects to stripped out. The handle now just spins around without turning the shaft and we cannot turn the apples anymore.
4,Kids love it!!!,An amazing gadget for the cook who has everything. Does exactly what it's supposed to. Works on potatoes as well. It's a real neat toy to have.
1,Why change a good design.,"Have one of these and decided to get another to help the wife, they changed the design ofthe new one and don't work well at all. They cheapened up the design. The corer is wayto flimsy. To bad the don't just charge more and make a good product. I guess that iswhy I still have the one that works and is 15 years old. Sent it back. Don't buy!"
4,Great product - Got my apples frozen,"I really enjoyed using the product - it worked well, made my apple preparation tasks easy and saved me tons of time."
2,"OK for light use, but NOT long lasting","I was excited to get this peeler at the beginning of apple season and save hours over using a little potato peeler & knife making applesauce & pies. It worked fine the first day. Unfortunately, after only two batches (two 5-gallon buckets), this peeler is completely toast. The wooden handle that screws on broke first; we had to find a longer screw than what was provided to make it stay on. Then, the device at the front of the peeler that cores the apples began to bend. I tried to bend it back in place, but the issue is that it's dulled enough that it's no longer cutting through the apples, and the weight of each piece of fruit is just pushing it further out of place. Finally, the rod that you put the apples onto is bent and wobbly as well.I'm sending this back for a refund and will be looking for a heavier duty peeler. Very disappointed."
3,"apple peeler, slicer & corer",I have had other kinds of peelers before but this one works wonderfully. I peeled a bushel of apples in just a couple of hours. Works GREAT!!!!
4,"Makes very quick work of apples and potatoes, but is hard to clean.","If you like making apple pie, apple sauce, or mashed potatoes, this little device will save you lots of time.Basically, you stick an apple or potato and the spikes and turn the handle. In a few seconds, you have a peeled and optionally cored and sliced apple or potato.It's sturdy and well made.I'm giving it only 4 stars, though, because it's a little tricky to get it on the counter firmly and because it's a little bit of a pain to clean.Personally, now that I've used one, I'm never going to core and slice apples or potatoes ""by hand"" again. For $20, the time you save is definitely worth it."
4,Great for peeling apples!!!,We peeled 6 bushels of apples for applebutter. This product made the work go 10 times faster.
2,Slices doesn't peel,"This slices my apples without also peeling them! Maybe you have to have the perfect size apple to use each and every time? I don't know, but this is only good if I want sliced apples with the peel still on."
5,Time Saver!,I process a bushel of apples every fall into applesauce so this gadget really helps me save time in hand peeling.
3,Capable apple peeler.,"Peeler is lighter-weight than one I had previously used. The handle screw stripped out when I was putting it together, but I went to the hardware store and rigged up a repair. The spring on the handle release came loose and required about an hour to get it back on. The apple slicer blade is more lightweight than the Pampered Chef, and actually bends as the apple is sliced. I don't think it will last many seasons, but it is about 60% of Pampered Chef price. I am satisfied enough to not send it back. It's OK."
4,Apple peeler and corer,"The product is made of pretty good quality, however, the handle has an issue of staying on and tight. Need to glue it in order to stay and something that probably won't affect the overall performance, but a little upsetting that there is any issue to begin with."
5,Magic Apple Machine,"My husband and I picked 20 pounds of apples with a friend of ours last weekend. On the way home he told us about this machine and we made fun of him for being such a gadget head. We then borrowed the machine from him, and it was magic. We were instantly converted. With the help of the machine we had peeled, cored and evenly sliced about 26 apples, half for dehydrating and half for making apple butter. We accomplished this in under an hour. It evenly slices the apples into perfect circles that would make for a beautiful tart. The machine is amazing, it blew our minds. The biggest trick was attaching it to our dinning room table, we had to put a small spacer in to fit the vice onto the table, but it's a small price to pay. We bought our own machine the next day, and we're planning another trip to the orchard."
2,"Great product, cheaply made","I used this about 5 times and it is already starting to rust. I love how it works, but am really disappointed about the rusting. My advice would be that if you want one to buck up and pay the extra amount for a quality one."
2,Apple Corer/slicer,"The product works, but it's made cheaply! Compared to an apple peeler/corer that I borrowed from a friend, it seemed like a toy. The blade is thinner, all metal parts seem inferior."
1,Didn't recieve pictured item (with straight blade) got one with a loop blade instead. I wanted the straight blade,Didn't recieve pictured item (with straight blade) got one with a loop blade instead. I wanted the straight blade thats why I ordered it from amazon. I could get the loop bladed one at my local grocery store.
2,not good,"peeeler works well, the corer and slice do not, the coring slicing blade is too flimsy, it bends and twists binding the shaft."
3,Great design but a pain to clean,"The apple peeler and corer does what it says it does pretty well. However it has a couple of serious flaws, it is difficult to remove apple cores from the prongs, I cut my thumb badly trying to do this. More generally the design makes it very difficult to get clean and dry and, because it is made of steel, drying it well is essential. Despite my best efforts the central shaft on mine has rusted.Overall 3 stars, it is worth the cleaning and drying effort for doing a pile of apples, but not worth getting it out for a few."
4,Time saving and fun,"This apple peeler is fun to use. It is the first one I have ever owned and really appreciate the time saved over doing the same job by hand. I baked an apple cake today which called for four peeled, cored and sliced baking apples. The apples where ready within five minutes! I would recommend peeling both ends of the apple before doing the rest on the peeler, as the peeler cannot reach that last 1/2"" or so at either end. Other than this minor ""flaw"" it peels, cores and slices perfectly."
5,what a time saver!,"this is such a useful as well as fun tool to have in your kitchen....it peels, cores and slices all at the same time.....it takes about 3 seconds to finish out an apple....as a footnote, it also works on potatoes...."
4,Core Appeal,"Simply amazing.This is a wonder for dehydrating. It took about 5 minutes to peel, core, and slice an entire bag of apples. My only complaint is with the plastic disk on the bottom side of the table clamp. It seems something that has more ""grab"" like a hard rubber would be more appropriate. Other than that its only weakness is with weak or soft apples, it will spin out the core and no longer be able to rotate the apple through the slicer. Although, my mistake was getting soft apples in the first place, yuck!"
5,Works quite well,"I had my doubts when I first purchased this, but works very well. It works best with regular shaped apples, but in general, it works for irregularly shaped ones too. The device does a great job of peeling - it does not take off a lot of extra fruit. The coring and spiral cut features are very nice too and work well. Comes with an extra blade."
2,Apple Peeler,"It arrived with no handle. When the handle came, after one day of use the screw in the handle was stripped. We glued it and it works all right except for not rotating. It takes some getting used to, but it works. I think all of them are tricky to use."
1,Not worth it in the long run,"When I first recieved this apple peeler, I loved it. It peeled and cored apples in no time..making easy work out of pies and any dish calling for sliced apples. Well..after a few mos of use, it now stinks. It pulverizes my apples, no matter how firm. It doesn't finish coring them..instead it breaks it into pieces..leaving half a core. My opinion is..this works great if you only use it maybe once every two mos. With more use, it starts to fail. Mine is useless now."
1,Not what I wanted,I was very dissapointed in the international apple peeler.. It was very cheeply made and deffinately did not work well. I would not recommend buying this product to anyone.
5,A must-have if you have an apple tree,"I have had an apple peeler corer for years. When we had a prolific apple tree I used to take a bunch of apples and the peeler corer into my daughters' pre-school and kindergarten. It was a big hit. Little hands love to turn the crank and watch the magic. Making apple pies is a cinch. We used the peeler corer recently to make hash brown potatoes. I gave away my original peeler corer, which I loved, because I like this one a little better due to a couple of improvements: the rubber pads to avoid slipping and scratching surfaces, and the wing nut on the corer/slicer (good if you want to move this part to one side to just peel a potato or whatever without coring/slicing). Another feature I like is not shown in the picture I'm looking at: the extended handle on the clamp which helps give you more leverage for firmly clamping. For my original peeler corer I always had a pair of pliers handy in order to clamp firmly enough to avoid slipping."
5,love it,bought this because i was tired of peeling and cutting apples for my kids. they love to use it it is so easy to use. they even eat more apples now. great buy well worth the money.
5,Ayuh.,"""Recipes From a Very Small Island"" by Linda & Martha Greenlaw is a well written with good old-fashioned Maine recipes. The recipes are simple, yet very delicious."
5,The Trouble with Skateboarding,my son - age 14- hates to read but loves to skateboard and he actually read this book in less than a week with no prompting from me. The fact that it was set in the geographic area where we live also helped make it interesting. He said he liked it (high praise from him for a book!)
2,Misleading picture,"I love the dull grey brushed steel look of the watch shown in the picture, and also the dull black leather which gives a raw natural feel. But the watch is NOT anything like it. It comes with a very shiny metal case and a very shiny black leather strap. It's just not the style I expected from the picture. It looks much more old-fashioned in real life."
1,Watch not working.,I bought this watch for my daughter for Christmas present. Yesterday I gave her the gift as I will be away for holidays. she opened and found that the watch was not working. At first we thought that it might be needing a battery . Today we put a new battery and still it is not working. I am very disappointed.
4,Great gift item,"I purchased this for my mother as an early christmas gift. She loved it.After seeing my mother wear the watch, I appreciate how well the leather band goes with the sliver face of the watch. I can definitely see this particular watch in both a formal and casual setting.Like many of the other reviews of this watch, the time setting knob was quite small and took a little while to get a proper grip on, but this was not really a big deal. On another note, if you have small wrists this might not be the watch for you, I noticed the watch moving around a bit on my mothers wrist.All in all, I see this as a great gift item from a quality watch maker that anyone one can enjoy."
4,Reasonable Price,I am happy with this product. The price is reasonable and it goes well with any clothes.
3,Mediocre at best,"I was sort of disappointed when I got this book and began reading it. It wasn't really what I had expected, but looking back, I can't remember what exactly I was expecting.The book is basically about two women who developed this ""scorecard"" to get their lives and husbands in line. Both came from pretty different scenarios and the content of the book is mostly about their specific situations and what they did to change them. I guess I was looking for more of a generic guideline. The book does provide some worksheets for you to work through your own things, but it follows the format they created.I never did finish the book. I'm not sure I would recommend to buy it - I'll sell you mine; it's still brand new."
1,lacking,"I came upon this book at a garage sale and thought i'd try it out since i knew of one of the authors. I was pretty disapointed. as other reviewers have already stated, if a man wrote a book like this, he'd be labeled a pig. save your money, which is only about $2 judging by the listed pricing but you are better off with a king sized candy bar."
4,Very comfy single seating swing,"I thought I'd get this in place of a porch swing, and I love it, but it's NOT a two person swing. It's very comfortable, very nice looking, and super-sized for one person, but two people in it would be extremely cozy (too cozy). Overall, I recommend it if you don't need swing for more than one."
4,Everyone really does have a story,"I have been a fan of David Johnson's newspaper columns for more than 20 years, but I always viewed them as isolated stories. By collecting them in a book -- and tying them together with his own life story -- Johnson shows them as part of a larger narrative. The setting is northern Idaho but the themes -- love, family, hardship, compassion and success -- are universal."
4,No Ordinary Book,"David Johnson is a born storyteller who finds the most extraordinary stories from ordinary folks, as well as revealing his own warm heart. This book is a pleasure to read."
4,As good as going on vacation,"The Idaho Tourist Board should hire David Johnson, because he makes the state as interesting as anywhere I've ever been. More interesting, since he actually takes you into the lives of all kinds of people, as well as his own. Anybody who can find his favorite place near a town called Dreary sees things that most of us don't. IF Idaho is as interesting as David Johnson makes it, I wonder what he would do with New York City."
2,Enjoyable stories but tends to self-promote,I found many of the stories enjoyable but the author tends to inject his own life into too much of the work which is distracting. The book would be better served by a cursory introduction followed by the many wonderful stories of everyday people (stories that I find much more enjoyable than any Hollywood could produce). Instead the author wraps his own life into many of the stories which creates more of a story about him instead of about the people. It would be better to get this book from the Library and try to skip over the self-promotion.
1,Don't Buy This Book,"I'm a big wrestling fan, imagine me getting this book & finding out it is 64 pages long thats right 64 [...] pages for $ 9.00"
2,Iron Man is 2 1/2 minutes shorter than the original,"As other people have pointed out, Iron Man is edited on this. On the Paranoid CD it's 5:58; here it's 3:29. A chunk of one solo is removed --poorly--in addition to the premature fade out. Bummer."
2,Buy a different Black Sabbath Complilation,For some reason on this best of album they decided to shorten the song Iron Man. Iron Man is a great song and deserves to be heard in its complete form. Who ever was in charge of putting this cd together has just lost themselves a huge amount of sales buy editing one of Sabbath's most well known songs.I recommend this albumWe Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll
4,Not too shabby for a single disc best-of,"I already own Sabbath's ""We Sold Our For Rock 'N Roll"",their 1976 best-of collection.But this new collection has five somgs that aren't on their 70's release. ""Supernaut"", ""Hole in the Sky"", ""Rock 'N Roll Doctor"", ""Never Say Die"", and ""Dirty Women"". The songs are,of course,remastered,sound a LOT better than on Sold Our Soul. And,I too, am getting tired of seeing ""Changes"" on EVERY best-of Sabbath album. The only other complaint is ""Iron Man"". WHY is the song edited?? It was cut in half!! Not a bad disc to start learning of the power & magnitude of this great band. But if you could afford the extra cash, I would recommend ""Symptom of the Universe"", Sabbath's two disc best of that was released about three-and-a-half years ago."
1,Greatest Hits are for lazy people,"Every song of every Ozzy era Black Sabbath album is great. And some you will learn to love. There is no reason for greatest hits.Buy their Debut, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage. They are all excellent. The last 2, Technical Extasy and Never Say Die definitely show their signs of a burning out band, but if you become the die hard Black Sabbath fan, then these will be necessary for your collection.DO NOT BUY!!! Buy their individual albums."
3,Not a fan of remastered songs,"I got this cd for my husband who is a huge fan of Black Sabbath's early work. Although the selections of songs on this was pretty good, he was disappointed to hear that they ""cleaned"" up the songs a bit, parts that dragged off at the end, etc were no longer there. If you just want a sample of their stuff, this is a great cd. If you're a purist, look elsewhere."
3,Good but unneccessary!,"Greatest Hits 1970-1978 is a single disc overview of Ozzy Osbourne's years in Black Sabbath. While it is full of Sabbath classics like Paranoid, Sweat Leaf, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and War Pigs, there is really no need for this complation to exist! First of all the double disc set Symptom of the Universe is available. Secondly there is already a single disc Sabbath complation out there ""We Sold Our Soul for Rock n Roll"", which I would recommend over Greatest Hits 1970-1978 if you are only wanting a single cd instead of the two disc Symptom of the Universe."
5,Great CD,"One of the best best of albums of all time,only flaw is Iron Man is an abbreviated version."
3,I Should Have Read the Reviews First!!!,"Great reviews from everyone. Why didn't I read them before buying this mistake??!!! Iron Man is my favorite Sabbath tune. Why did they have to edit this one??!!! It did, however, prompt me to go out and immediately purchase a fresh 'Paranoid' CD! What a classic ... Iron Man, War Pigs, Electric Funeral ... it doesn't get any better than that. I'm a huge Zeppelin fan, but 'Paranoid' stands up to any Zep album ... plain and simple. ROCK ON, Guys!!"
1,Just a big money maker,"Black Sabbath (along w/ Led Zeppelin & Deep Purple) are the kings of hard rock, but this collection does not serve Sabbath well at all. For example, you don't fade out ""Iron Man,"" that's like fading Zeppelin's ""Stairway To Heaven"" or Purple's ""Child In Time."" A big, big mistake. Well, I guess Ms. Osbourne is just putting this ""money maker"" out in time for that Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame ritual.Honestly, far too many important songs are missing, you'd be better off buying the ""Symptom of the Universe"" two disc set from a few years back. Matter of fact, Rhino really needs to put together a two disc set of Deep Purple. One disc covering these great bands is inadequate to say the least.Buyer beware."
3,Black Sabbath - 'Greatest Hits 1970-1978' (Rhino),"Sixteen track compilation,that is strictly for the completist OR someone who,in the past had to pawn off their entire Sabbath catalog to pay rent,make bail,pay off their dealer,etc.Tunes here that make for great listening and all are the band's namesake ""Black Sabbath"",""N.I.B."",""Sweet Leaf"",""Supernaut"",""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" among others.It's just that there are plenty of other better compilations of Sabbath's work available out there."
3,Thanks to all of you,"This is not a review. I just wanted to say THANKS to everyone who wrote reviews. I had NO IDEA that Iron Man was edited for this disc. Even though I have all of the other Sabbath stuff, I was thinking of buying this just to have it in my collection. I appreciate you letting me know of the awful decision to edit a classic song."
3,There are better collections out there.,"While it's hard to recommend any single-disc collection covering the Ozzy years of Black Sabbath over 2002's 2-disc ""Symptom of the Universe,"" I can understand the need to have one on the market to cater to casual fans for whom ""Symptom"" may be too extravagant (or expensive). However, the execution here leaves something to be desired. Presenting ""Iron Man"" in a three-and-a-half minute edited version is baffling. It is one of, if not the most popular song in Sabbath's entire catalog, and the main attraction for this disc's target audience, so presenting it in this truncated form is inexcusable. ""Rock 'N' Roll Doctor"" should really have been left off in favor of the full version. This isn't a bad album otherwise, but I'd still recommend ""Symptom of the Universe"" over this, or even Universal's recently released ""Iron Man: The Best of Black Sabbath"" if you absolutely need a single-disc hits collection and don't mind importing."
3,I think this could have been better,"Admittedly I am only a causal fan of Black Sabbath. I grew up in the decade of these hits, but this leaves me slightly flat. I am practically not fond of the track order. All of the tracks seem to sound alike. I remembered more originally during their height of popularity. Fortunately, for Sabbath fans Ozzie meant more than theatrics & his voice was the main power behind the band. And here, Ozzie is still the main reason to buy this CD. Also, for some comparisons, I suggest you pick up a Best of Cream CD or AC/DC's Back in Black."
4,Good intro for casual fans like me,"Being a casual fan of Black Sabbath I thought this would be perfect for me...BUT...... even I knew something was wrong with ""Iron Man"". It just fades out. Criminal! They could've left another song off to get the complete version of ""Iron Man"". It's only one of their most famous songs.I think, eventually I may pick up 'Symptom of the Universe', but for now 'Greatest Hits' will have to do.As for the music itself, pretty primal stuff. Bill Ward verges on being a heavy jazz drummer, and depsite Tony Iommi's solos, I think Bill's drums are the lead instrument.Ozzy's voice was made for metal... almost makes me forget his rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame""... almost. Some of the lyrics can be eyeroll inducing, as on ""Sweet Leaf"" where Ozzy sings, ""I love you, though I know you can't hear me."" All I could imagine was 'Mary Jane' thinking, ""I'm a freaking herb! I can't hear anything!""All in all a good intro to a great band."
5,Excellent compilation,"Oh, Iron Man is chopped in half ... oh, oh!! You've got more than 79 minutes of music shoe-horned onto a disk and still some people manage to complain. Yes, part of a solo is excised and the song fades after three and a half minutes - just like it is supposed to. What you are listening to is the ""single"" version of Iron Man, released some 38 years ago by Warner Bros. Back then, radio didn't play six minute long songs. If you ask me, it's still a lot of music for the money."
2,Civil War trivia,"It's okay... I think it has a lot of ""filler"" in it. I'd rather have a smaller book with precise information in it - stuff that you would not find in other books or you wouldn't have come up with on your on."
2,Don't Waste Your Time-,"The information is well known. I did not realize the book that the book was so basic. For Civil War buffs, the book is a waste of time. School kids might like it."
4,Fun to read but be warned...,"...you had better be up on your Civil War basics before attempting to read this book. It assumes that the reader is well aware of the main battles, campaigns, personalities and relative strengths and weaknesses of both the North and the South.There's bound to be something new in here for everyone but the hardest of the hard core Civil War afficionados. Well-written, breezy, although oftentimes disjointed and random.This book is also published under the titles 'Our Incredible Civil War' and 'The Incredible Civil War' by the same author."
4,student,There are many interesting and delightful news bits in this book. Lots of things you'll not encounter unless you read every Civil War book avalibale. Easy read. You'll also want to keep it close at hand while reading other books to jog your memory on an event.
5,imagine that !,"If you thought you knew everything about the civil war than chances are you were wrong. I found out things in this book I never knew, like Robert E. Lee was buried without any shoes, an 8 year boy watched as Jefferson Davis was driven off to prison and that boy was Woodrow Wilson, plus so many other facts covered in this book.If you enjoy fascination facts than this book is for you."
4,unique civil war book,"I can recommend this book because the facts I found were not only interesting, but also important to know as an American. I think every history teacher should probably own a copy. Thanks!"
3,Not bad for the price,"As an avid civil war reader I was a little disappointed at the amount of really new material. Most of the stories will be familiar to civil war buffs. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the story of the Rains brother as a notable exception to this. That was truly a fascinating story, and one I was not aware of until I read it in this book."
4,Fun Facts of the Civil War,"There are many books written about the Civil War that discuss the battles and military tactics. These topics are good for someone studying military strategies. This book is for the people who like the interesting side facts of a situation, or the little things that didn't necessarily have any thing to do with the outcome, but are interesting to know. Some are humorous, some are sad, but at the title suggests, they are strange and fascinating. Burk Davis brings these to us in an interesting way. This low cost book is very useful to me in my study of the Civil War."
5,history buffs,this is a fun interesting book for any history buff on the civil war. It is fun to just flip through and have as a conversation piece.
5,"The Book That Answers ""What's the big deal?""","This is the book that I give to people who ask, ""What's the big deal about the Civil War?"" Burke Davis serves up fascinating little sidebars to history, the colorful details, the human stories behind the big battles and the politics.Read ""The Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts"" to learn why the Civil War still intrigues people almost 150 years later."
4,The Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts,"This amusing book is full of odd tidbits about the Civil War, but really does help shed a lot of light into the details of the war most never heard of before. Each chapter is another set of facts that will amuse and lead one to realize how complex this war really was.It is not a difficult read, and does not have to be read in any particular order. Each chapter stands alone and apart from those preceeding and following it. I notice it is no longer available in print, but used bookstores may have it, or it may be in the closeout bargain section of your local bookseller. If you can find it, buy it. It is a gem with a great deal of useful information."
3,Not our favorite Thomas video,"We have several Thomas videos and this is not our favorite -- James is just too ill-tempered and cranky to make this enjoyable. In nearly every story he's criticizing or making fun of other engines. He usually gets his comeuppance in the end, but overall it's just not a positive experience. There are plenty of other good Thomas videos to buy besides this one."
1,Tape Broke Within First Day.,"When I Got This In The Mail, it Broke After A Couple Times Playing It, The Tape Inside Splitted In Half And Snapped."
5,Replica is still SUPER COOL,"Some people complain that the Replica books are getting shorter, and, okay, I admit it, they are getting shorter. But all that matters is that the books are COOL, right. Once again, Marylin Kaye writes another stunning Replica book, THE PLAGUGE TRILOG BOOK TWO, PLAY. In this book, Amy actually goes inside her best friend, to save her life. I can't wait for the third book in the PLAGUE TRILOGY!"
5,Perfect replacement,Perfect Replacement-works with other parts of the blenderDo NOT use motor to install-hand tighten or use a pair of pliersCheap way to restore this poorly designed engagement on this blender-keep moisture off it to slow corrosion and lengthen life
5,saved my blender,"This little drive pin saved my 40 year old Oster blender, putting it back to work as good as new. Without it, I would have had to throw my blender away and pay big bucks to buy a new one. I've used the blender every day since installation (which was easy) for about 2 months now and can see it's set to last."
1,The quality is not what I expected,"The pin wears out very quickly, that is why this is my 4 order of the same product. I ordered 2 before and ordered 2 more again this time."
5,Osterizer Parts,"Finding this part, and another, made my elderly Mother very happy as her old Osterizer blender can be used again.It's good to find folks with parts in stock to allow a handyman to fix a perfectly good appliance, rather than have to throw it away!We are such a disposable society, it is refreshing to be able to repair and use a product for years."
2,It fits- but poor quality,"This fit's my 1959 Oster beehive blender perfectly. But after about 3 weeks of use, it's rusted. Still works but, hello?! My old one never rusted over 50+ years (before the rubber blew chunks)I TRY my darndest to stick to old, beefy, trusted gear- then only to get poorly produced replacement parts. It's a nut with a washer that needs to have some water resistance- not that hard to produce- or so i thought. Are we all getting sucked into the vortex of mediocrity?"
5,Square drive pin for Oster,I have a pretty old Oster beehive blender and this pin finally wore out and was not producing the power to blend or it would not blend what so ever. I took it apart and installed this pin and my old beehive blender is back blending and crushing ice almost like new.
5,I like it!,"Anti-pushback point provides dependable writing. Press down as hard as you like -- the point will remain extended, allowing you to write without stopping to make adjustments. Cap denotes ink color. Clear barrel lets you monitor ink supply."
4,"Great DVD player with great features, but there's a catch.","I couldn't be happier with the features of this DVD player. The picture and sound quality are superb as well. The only major drawback I've found is that it doesn't play CD-R's that I've burned myself on my PC. I have a rather large CD collection, from which I've created many ""greatest hits"" CDs containing my personal favorites. The DVD-C220 DVD player also doubles as my CD player for my home stereo, and I now find myself looking to by another CD player just to play my favorite CDs. Had I known this before I bought, I probably would have went with a Sony."
3,fits on rainhead,"It does fit on a ceiling-mount rain head, for those who are wondering. Easy to install. I'm disappointed that my skin doesn't feel less itchy though, as that was my purpose for buying."
5,Fusion Reborn,"I love this one. Maybe because it has gogeta in it or veku but its really good. I wish they had the fight with gogeta a little longer and showed more of his abilities. Other than that it was a really good movie, if only it was longer.."
2,I think this movie is WWAAAAYY too overrated!,"Okay, I admit that Gogeta is a cool character (I think Veggeto and SS4 Gogeta is better than SS2 Gogeta), but I think it might just be a rental movie. I don't want to give away the story but I will say this, Gogeta appears in this movie for about, oh lets say 3-5 minutes total. I watched this movie in Japanese on that youtube site and I was a little disappointed. I thought for some reason that this movie was never going to be released (mainly because of the fact that Hitler is in this movie but gets his butt kicked) but now I think I was better to not see it and just play one of the Budokai games as Gogeta and beat the crap out of the other characters with him."
4,A Good DBZ movie yeah!!!!,"Ok I rented the uncut and it was awsome!Basically its about I guy in the underworld whogot in-fused with evil energy thus creating Janemba!Goku and Vegeta make Super Gogeta and its totally radical!Buy it,rent it.Whatever just watch."
5,Best toy ever!,"My son loves this. He got a kitchen for Christmas, and this is one of the food items we got to go with it. He loves it. By far his favorite item in the kitchen. He loves taking the little pineapple rings out and putting them back. It is a little smaller than I expected, but is in scale with most of his other toy food."
1,Dreadful in every way,"I am a linux kernel developer, working on a project that involves the open source version of the Infiniband kernel drivers. I figured I'd take advantage of this opportunity and learn as much as possible about Infiniband. I'm still doing that, but without using this book.This is truly one of the worst technical books I've ever had the misfortune of purchasing. I am returning it now. Aside from being an unreadable jumble of high- and low-level technical notes, even the print quality is spectacularly poor.The only reason to buy this would be if there is nothing else available. Fortunately, you'll find better information from the Infiniband Trade Association. Fill out the online form, and download all the documents, and you'll be just fine.Hope that helps."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY.,"Robert Axle is not an inventor he is a fabricator. He takes items and combines them and proceeds to sell them on cheesy infomercials. I enjoy Kevin Spacey in many of his movies, but this movie was not my cup of tea.Robert fabricates an item that hurts many people. Robert goes to jail for many years and the movie is how he tried to move on with his life. He wants to form a bond with his daughter and get his lift back. He finds support in the oddest people. There are moments that were funny, but overall the movie was boring and I kept finding my attention wandering. I wanted to like the movie, but didn't. Great actors, but the storyline was a flop."
4,hmmmmm.,"I can't decide how I feel about this film, and generally I take that as a good sign. If a film stays with you, and you think about it for a while ... even if you didn't particularly enjoy it, I think that is indicative of a ""good' film; to say the least, it is provocative. It has a great cast, and most of them play their characters very well. In the end, much like true life, there are none that you truly like or dislike, but rather you find the good and bad in each. Mostly I struggled with the main character, which I wanted to like, and root for when he did good and kind things, but then felt deeply betrayed for liking him when he returned to old habits with a despicable act. From me, this film get's a ""C"" for entertainment value, but an ""A"" in the interesting and thought provoking category - let's average that out to 4 stars. Overall it is an interesting watch that I recommend to most ... watch it, but only once."
4,great flick,"If you are an inventor or even want to be one then this is the movie for you. Sadly its less about the industry than it lends itself, but more about making amends and moving forward."
3,Nothing great,"With so many well known actors, I was expecting something a little funnier. The plot was very slow moving and predictable. There were quite a few funny parts but there were also some parts that were not so great. I wondered why the movie was not popular or well known, especially with the cast, and after watching it I know why. It gives you something to watch and entertain yourself, but it's nothing special."
1,A Straight-to-Video Clunker,"Failing to realize its potential as an infomercial satire, ""Father of Invention"" (2010) takes the predictably limp comedy-drama route. Kevin Spacey and a good supporting cast receive no help from writer-director Trent Cooper's unimaginative approach. The 93-minute running time feels like an eternity."
2,Wasted premise,"Kevin Spacey's performance is the only thing that kept me from giving this a lower rating.What starts off as a satire on all those ""as seen on TV"" products soon degenerates into a not so feel good relationship comedy.The script misfires on most cylinders and the rest of the cast seem wasted.One viewing was more than enough. Not recommended."
3,Lacking Something Despite Kevin Spacey,It's hard to watch an Academy Award winner struggle to pull together a satire that just doesn't ever fire on all cylinders. This movie was mildly amusing and some of the characterizations would be worth it to the actors' fans.But overall I can't really recommend it as good entertainment.
3,Straight to DVD,"Movie isn't so great but my mom, husband, and I are in the auditorium scenes. With the cast involved, I thought the movie would have done better."
2,So much potential but fails to make the grade,"This should have been a really good movie. The cast, led by the very talented Kevin Spacey, just got lost in this slapdash production. The premise is that Spacey is an infomercial inventor/huckster akin to Ron Popeil who spends time imprisoned when one of his products mutilates users. While in prison his wife marries an endearing Forest Ranger and squanders hundreds of millions of dollars on frivolous pursuits. Upon release he lives with his daughter who runs a Women's Employment Agency and rooms with a lesbian gym teacher.Now it would seem impossible to let this story line jump the shark but with bad writing, directing and editing the impossible happens. If you listen carefully you can actually hear the cry for help silently shouted by the talented cast of this movie. The best I can say is that it's not horrible."
1,Disappointment,"There is only one word I can think of regarding this movie. It is a word ""disappointment"". Film is mediocre with poorly thought out, right out of the textbook formula that a cast of actors is unable to dignify with some meaningful stunts or outbursts of humor.Kevin Spacey plays a scam artist who lives off his infomercials and the financial success it brings, until one day one of his marketing products goes wrong and he looses everything. Fresh out of jail he is back with his family trying to re-establish himself in a real world. It is part comeback story, part ""reconnect with the ones you love"" story and part of it weepy redescovery on what it means to have family and friendships. But this movie did not have a punch from the start. But the time movie was coming to a conclusion, I could no longer wait for it to be over."
4,Enjoyable Comedy From Kevin Spacey,"I like Kevin Spacey and I try to see everything he's in and this is not the usual film for him.He plays one of those awful infomercial type guys fresh out of prison,after serving 8 years for one of his products (some good laughs in this) injuring people. He's trying to start life again and re-establish a relationship with his daughter.The cast is really good,Heather Graham is very funny as the angry lesbian roommate of Spacey's daughter,""Face or Nuts?"" and I also enjoyed Johnny Knoxville's acting in this.I thought it was a well made film and I enjoyed it very much with many solid laughs."
1,doesnot work,"Upon trying this equipment, the machine would not pass the dough through the die. Returned, not interested in it any more. Will be purchasing a hand crank pasta machine instead."
1,This machine is not very good.,"The negatives about this machine...1. It can not mold 100% semolina flour. It can only mold 50%mix of semolina with 50% all purpose white flour. It can notmold high gluten flour (say 100% bread flour).2. The molds are made partly with plastic. I've used it aboutsix times and twice the mold broke. ...3. If you have dough inside the machine it may just dry up andwhen you turn on your machine to use it, it'll break yourmold. It happened to me twice.The bottom line is that I am [angry] and I am thinking about throwing this away. What is the point of using a machine that can not mold 100% semolina flour? You call yourself a pasta machine?"
4,LONG LASTING,"I'VE HAD MY SIMAC PASTAMATIC OVER 20 YEARS AND STILL GOING STRONG.... ""TON O PASTA"" ALSO USE IT TO STUFF MANICOTTI..WORKS GREAT!"
1,Useless piece of junk,"I bought this a few months back, and have yet to make a batch of pasta. We bought the ""precise kitchen scales"" per several recommendations and followed the directions precisely. The dough ends up a clump of glue that doesn't feed through the pasta die holes. Clean-up is a total mess, the pasta dies included are not for any popular/normal shapes, and on the first use my wife cracked one of the plastic dies that was included. We resorted to pulling out the dough, rolling it out, and cutting it by hand on the last use, and that even didn't work right. My advice is to stay far-away from the pasta maker, as the construction is flimsy/weak, its very difficult to clean, and unless you have more luck that us, you won't get it to produce pasta. It's become a $65 piece of junk taking up a corner of one of our back kitchen cabinets."
2,Not worth the effort,"I've had a Simac Pasta Machine for at least 10 years. I use it rarely as it is noisy and hard to clean. Tasty pasta, though."
5,Practically foolproof !,"I have the Simac PastaMatic Pasta Maker and I used it for the first time tonight. I made spaghetti. It was perfect! All I did was follow the directions almost exactly. When the directions said the dough should be moist, but not sticky and in walnut-sized lumps, I made certain that it was. I did do one thing differently than the instructions: Since I only used 1/2 pound of flour, I found that two eggs were not quite enough, so instead of breaking another egg I substituted water. (about a teaspoonful) It worked for me.I'm still not sure what the two reviewers that had major problems with the machine did, but I, personally, had no trouble at all. It is, so far, one of my better gadgets."
2,Not the best,"I used an old OSROW pasta machine for years. This is essentially identical with the Takka and the Pasta express x1000 thru 4000. This machine, while it does not have the variety of dies that the Simac has, is far superior in operation and performance. I got a simac because of all of the good reviews. I am extremely disappointed.The Osrow was much easier to make use. The Simac has a shutter that you pull out when you are ready to extrude. The shutter leaks flour (semolina) and that jams the die and can damage it. I rarely get a full batch of pasta out of the Simac I have to work with it, clear the passage of flour and end up throwing away some dough. With the Osrow, you simply reverse the (more powerful) motor when you are ready to extrude and the pasta comes out perfectly. It is much easier to operate than the Simac and seems to be much sturdier.I intend to sell the Simac and go back to the pasta express/Osrow."
4,EASY PASTA,"I'm not sure what the other complaints are about. There are no new pasta makers on the market and this was previously considered the best. This is not a ""pasta for dummies"" machine. You need to use common sense and alrady feel comfortable cooking. But is is a million times easier than pasta from scratch. I love this machine and will use it for years to come. . ."
1,Does not hold a candle to my old casio e125,"Not only do you get no case, no cradle, and no user's guide, but you get a battery that lasts 2 hours at medium brightness with secure digit card inserted, a super slippery stylus, and you'll be happy to spend hours and hours setting up the sync software, plus you'll be sticking the stylus into the ""reset"" hole many, many times each joyful day. You'll love to bang your head against the wall numerous times when you want to sync it with more than one PC.I admit the styling is great, but this is a [poor] PDA, because it requires you to constantly soft reset. And it slows to a crawl when you run more than three apps at the same time. Fuhget it."
1,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT BUY IPAQS!","Product is overpriced for its chintzy characteristics. Looks really nice, but as they say,""looks can be deceiving"". I bet 90 percent of the iPaqs out there that have been purchased from 2003 through the present date are either completely useless or are in some need of repair and 99 percent of those broken are most likely not the fault of the purchaser. Hp/Compaq has a HUGE problem with screens (as you can read from the other hundreds of negative postings on Amazon alone). Mine was very well taken care of and lasted about as long as everyone else's has (5-6 months). I even purchased the extended warranty plan, in which you have no way of proving that you did not drop the unit. SOL! My suggestion: file a complaint with your local attorney general. That'll scare HP! (oh wait, they dont care because they are overseas in another country)."
1,Two days of nothing but frustrations,"Had my first experience with Pocket PC/Mobile Windows and it was a total letdown experience. Returned the 1910 after 48 hours. Just couldn't get the thing to work right. First I had to install Outlook to sync -- talking of monopoly! Then the synch wouldn't work. The ""wizard"" goes ""boo boo boo boo boo"" as it searches for the USB, even though the USB is right there, it can't find it, so after I went through the trouble to install Outlook, I wasn't able to synch at all. I fumbled like this for an hour to no avail. ... Forget it. Back it goes."
2,"Eggshell, fragile screen","I've just cracked my fourth ipaq screen in four years. They know they've got a problem but they just won't fix it. Why? So that we'll just buy another PDA, and another PDA, and another PDA..."
1,$300 paper weight!,"My husband bought this for me for my birthday in January. I am a pharmacy student and it comes in so handy when I work in a pharmacy. I call it my other brain. The other day while I was working at a pharmacy, it fell from the counter to the floor. It hit a rubber matted floor. The LCM (I think that is what it is called)is now broke. It looks as though liquid is oozing from the top corner. Ever store I have taken it to says it is cheaper to replace the whole unit. I called HP they said it will be 199.99 to replace plus shipping a labor. What a joke. I will buying a new one, just not an HP. If one little fall from a counter can cause such damage, it is not worth it. I am very disappointed in this product. Buyer Beware!"
1,DONT BUY THIS HUNK OF #$%@,"I've had my ipaq 1945 for about 3 mounths, the first day i used it, the screen chiped, and today, for the first time, I dropped my ipaq and the screen broke into a million shards of glass. HP now wantes to charge me $200!!!! to fix the sreeen. DONT BUY FROM IPAQ!! Unless you wanna throw $300 down the drain."
1,"Run, don't walk, from this clunker","Bought an IPAQ 1945 six months ago, nothing but trouble. Now on my second cycle of problems, already having serviced the unit once. Device will reset itself, losing all of the data you have on it, without warning. HP support is horrendous, off-shore call center in India with lots of canned answers, not insight, and difficulty with English. Buy another PDA, this one is trouble, unless you don't really need all those phone numbers and appointments, in which case you wonder why you are wasting your money on a PDA."
2,"Good if no problems, terrible customer service","I bought my IPAQ 1945 in Feb of 2004 and after six months of great use the screen started flickering. I sent it in and was told that ""You have spilled water on it and it will cost $190 to replace the screen.""(a rude way to put it even if true). I knew it was not true but apparently had no recourse. Either pay up or do without. Now after going six month's without a PDA I'm getting ready to buy another and I just can't make myself get another HP."
3,Love the unit but super fragile.,"When I started using the HP1945 it was the ultimate timesaver for me, especially the Outlook Contacts. I loved the design and the way it worked. After one week of use, the screen cracked just from being in my shirt pocket, and the unit was useless. I was lucky and able to return it as defective to the store I bought it from, and get a refund. I will be searching for a similar, but sturdier PDA."
2,IPAQ 1900 series has low LCD life,"I bought the IPAQ 1940 a couple of years back and I had no problems with it and loved it for its display and form factor. But after 18 months, the screen developed a big internal crack for no reason. Cost to replace that at HP is $200. I read more blogs and almost everyone has something to say about the LCD screen's defective construction for the IPAQ series. I would not recommend this product to anyone just for its durability reasons."
5,hp Ipaq pocket pc,"I was looking for an exact replacement to the one I had. This one was priced right, and in great condition. All the papers and cords were with it. It also came with 2 cases. Someone was very organized and made sure it was like opening it for the first time. It was great to get one in such good shape. Thanks."
1,Great PDA....when it's not crashing.,"Eager to use windows (I'm not a Palm OS fan) & buy a unit I could ""grow"" into I bought my first iPAQ 1945 in Sept 2003. Worked great & I loved it! Until it died (completely unresponsive) Jan 2004. Thankfully I bought an extended warranty from Best Buy, so I was able to walk in & exchange it because HP sent my mail-in box to the wrong state... Now, four weeks later, it hard reset. I gave it benefit of the doubt, and 2 days later, it wouldn't stop hard resetting.I took care of pocket pc (esp having already exchanged it once!), kept it in a hard case, & by no means overused it (I never used it's full capacity in fact). Having read the other consumer reviews, & exchanged the product twice, I suspect there is a fatal desing/structural flaw with this unit. I hope to exchange mine for a different product. Be forewarned - if you are going to gamble on this model, make sure you buy a nice extended warranty to go with it!!"
4,ActiveSync Problems,"I like my iPAQ 1910 very much and am considering the upgrade to the more powerful model. A major drawback for me is that ActiveSync will allow connections to only 2 (two!!) computers. I use my iPAQ with a PC at work, a PC at home, a laptop, and a PC at a 2nd home. It's a hassle each time that I change computers. With Palm, you just have their desktop on any computer and there are no problems. I can't imagine why Microsoft wanted to limit use to two computers. This limitation is something that you should consider before switching from a Palm to an iPAQ."
1,ipaq 1945 worse device I have ever used,"In my profession I use many electronic devices from pc's to measuring devices. This unit is by far the most unreliable of anything I have used to date. I've been trying to use my ipaq for simple pda purposes and it always has some sort of problem from not syncing with my pc at work or at home to just not turing on or off at times. It has lost information more times than I can count and it just doesn't want to go on line with the wireless card that I bought. I took it to my local Best Buy and was told to buy another unit because this one is just not usable because of the reliability issue. They didn't even want to look at it. I wish I could just return it but unfortunatly I don't have the online information to do so, I guess I'm just out the price of admission...$200 plus. I wouldn't buy another ipaq if my life depended on it."
1,Dead at 7 Weeks,"Do I like the product? Yes...if it would work. After seven weeks, the entire thing came to a grinding halt...poof! This would be only somewhat more amusing if the last Ipaq I owned, a 3630, had not had the screen go out when it was less than a month old. Compaq was nice enough not only to charge me $125.00 to repair it, but to erase the memory(not sure what that had to do with repairing the screen) and take nearly a month to return it to me. It took almost twenty phone calls and letter to the CEO of Compaq to get it returned. As a would-be purchaser, I would be leery of cheap manufacturing and terrible customer service."

Add $25.00-$40.00 to the cost for this. It also does not come with a cradle. Add more for that. As a would-be purchaser, I would be leery of cheap manufacturing and terrible customer service."
3,Good Idea,"A nice idea, I bought it as part of a package (with PCS-9) so it was a good deal.If you want to save $ buy a bungee cord.I like though"
1,Most Redundant Dohicky Ever,"Take an 1/8th inch piece of bungee cord, tie a loop at each end, move the bike so the back wheel's valve stem is facing forward, lift and move the front wheel so it's valve stem is facing backward, and slip the loops of the bungee chord over the valve stems.This tether weights a couple of ounces, keeps the wheel straight, AND keeps the bike from rolling so you can take it with you and lean the bike against a post or bench and not have it turn and fall or roll away.I made my first tether 30 yrs ago touring with panniers and a handlebar bag. I've been using them ever since."
1,JimmyG,"Don't waste your money on this, it is better to wrap a bungy cord around the bike frame and front tire to keep it from moving."
4,works but....,"it doesn't fit over taped handlebars, but it still will hold bike in place, so I'm overall pleased and would purchase again as I needed that tire to be in place."
5,Gotta love it!,"It's hard to believe Ashley was so young when she cut this album. She has all the attitude and personality necessary sell the message of any song, not to mention a very mature voice that is a pleasure to listen to. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes his/her country with heart-felt feeling. It's a little traditional and a little pop, and it's always near my CD player."
2,Not as good as Vox Diccionario Actual De La Lengua Espanola ...,"This is a smaller dictionary, by far. Most of the words I'm looking up are not available. I use the dictionary to help read through Spanish literature. I don't really understand the arrangement of this dictionary.. and I wasn't really sure the photos were useful. If anything, if I didn't know the word, I was more confused. The larger dictionary seems to edo a better job explaining the word and providing you with examples. In addition, the larger dictionary had a few pages that were drawings of a certain cituation. The definitions would send you to this photo to further explain the definition. I'm a VOX fan... but this edition was disappointing."
4,Who is Black Angel?,"Who is Black Angel,that is the question.The person who touched the brooch,real Black Angel,Mavis,Kirk,Martin,the woman in black suits,the new bride,the delivery boy in these persons hide.I can not find the final ansew of the question.This film is beatifull condision.June sing song sweety,invite us to the days of dreaming."
2,Lame Noir,"Well, the movie's got the noir look. Too bad the plot is straight out of ""Murder She Wrote"". What elevates this movie to two stars is the prescence of Peter Lorre as the shady nightclub owner. It just reminds you that Hollywood wasted this actor of considerable skill in shoddy vehicles like this."
3,A good entry in Universal's noir series,"The housewife with no police experience conducts an amazingly more thorough investigation into her husband's guilt or innocence than the cops do, but aside from that hard-to-swallow fact, this is a pretty good film noir that delivers solid performances, a well-developed but still easy to follow story (unlike a lot of noirs that seem to make it a point of honor to confuse viewers at least a little), and a satisfyingly twisty close. The DVD features a nice print of the film and a trailer in much better shape than most of the trailers included on DVDs of 1940s movies."
3,"oh, what great memories!","My wife frequently went to the El Monte and this album brought back so many memories. She really, really liked this. There were a few songs that weren't big hits back then, that are on the album, but overall this was very well worth the $."
4,"""The Wolf""","Wayne Wofford has been around for many years. And as many artists who perform in this genre, he has paid his dues-working clubs, halls, and other performance venues since the 60's. Wayne comes from a musical family, his brother is a drummer and his sister is an incredible vocalist. His playing is energetic, lively and spirited. He has a unique improvisational style and tone that is uncompromising. Wayne has so much to say musically and his dedication to the art of improvisation has not faded. He has continued to raise the bar for his ""musicality"" and with this CD, you can hear the power and the raw energy which is fueled by his intense technical ability. Wayne is one of the last truly talented sax players who have not dressed up their sound with the trappings of commercial acceptance. He is still playing his music from his heart with the passion of youth, tempered with the wisdom of time. Buy this CD and share it with your friends."
5,Great pencil!,"This is by far, best ergonomic pencil on the market. It is very comfortable to hold and allows me to write more without cramping my fingers. I would recommend this to anyone with arthritis in their hands or someone with very large hands."
5,A great book!,At first when I started this series I thougt it would be another fairy knight in armour princess book. Boy was I wrong! At first the beggining of the books are usaly confusing by introduceing new charecters like mendabar and daystar. Then you catch on and are enjoying the book. You probly learn somthing in the series but if you do I still have not figured it out! Lets all pray for more in the series. Until then get reading!
4,fun and funny,"This whole series is great, and should appeal not only to kids but to adult fans of Fractured Fairytales.This particular book is the last one in the series, and should not really be read as a stand-alone book. But it does seem fresh and different, because it follows two brand new characters.We also get a better sense of what it is like to wander around in the Enchanted forest if you are not the King of the Dragons or the King of the Enchanted Forest. All the talk in earlier books about how the forest can be a dangerous place starts to make more sense.Finally, there is a sort of chaste romance that takes place, featuring just one kiss (and that one for magical purposes). It's fun to watch develop, because it seems a lot more real than the type of love-at-first-sight or hate-turns-to-love romances that fantasy books often feature."
5,:),"My teacher read DEALING WITH DRAGONS to my class when i was in kindergarden. Everyone loved it. in second grade i started to read the rest of the series. i went through them, and i give them all *****. but if i had to pick my favorite, it would deffinately be Talking to Dragons. Now i'm in 6th grade, and i still read every book in this series again and again. If you happen to see this review, and you don't know if you're going to get the book, GET IT!!! if you read it, i'm positive you'll be getting the 'collectors addition' to read to your kids."
5,Go melt a wizard!,"Argelfraster!!!!!!!! This time the wizard-melting is limited to Antorell(for the fiftieth time!) Though it has a slightly (slightly! Don't get angry at me!)indefinite ending, in my opinion the book is well-written and it appeals to all ages. At school (where I am known among my friends for InSaNiTy) I have taken to pointing at people(preferably ones who have read the books) and saying ""Argelfraster!"" I love how Daystar and Shiara get out of their predicaments (though not by melting wizards)."
5,A Favorite!,"This is my Number One recommendation to anyone who asks. And people always ask me - I am a Librarian and Storyteller with experience in public libraries and school libraries from Texas to Germany. My suggestion to you is to read the first paragrahs, I think you will be hooked. ""Mother taught me to be polite to dragons. Particularly polite, I mean ...if you make a mistake, the dragon eats you."""
4,It's not the best work she's done.,"It was a good book, but some parts just plain didn't make sense to me. I read a lot so that doesn't happen to me much.For instance: Cimorene said Kazul wouldn't mind training the future queen of the Enchanted Forest. Was she betrothing them then and there? Or was she simply assuming that they were in love because that was how it came about for her and Mendanbar? True at the end of the book Daystar showed the slightest glimmering of affection toward Shiara, but that showed thourgh no where else except when he saved her from being a statue for the rest of her life.And when she broke arm. And Cimorene wasn't there for those events . Maybe it was just a mother's intuition."
5,For Harry Potter lovers!,"A real good book for Harry Potter and fantasy lovers! Under the wing of the mysterious Branwen, who claims to be his mother, the namless boy learns the lore of the ancient peoples and discovers the dragon inside himself."
3,pretty good value,"For the money, this was a good value.The system came with eveything you need for solid comunications and for a very good price."
4,PACKS POWER FOR A 10 INCH,"I REALLY DONT HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE SPEAKER EXCEPT IT HASNT LET ME DOWN YET, AND IT STILL PACKS A POWERFUL PUNCH SLAMING THE COMP. DOWN EVEN KLIPS CANT TOUCH THIS BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE MAJORLY ON HOW CLEAR YOU CAN HEAR YOUR MUSIC BUT WERES THE BASE... AND CERWIN VEGA PROVIDES THAT.. AND THEN SOME SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND SEMPER FI."
5,good for everyone on your gift list,"I have owned these speakers for the last few years, and they are more than I paid for. I really like their small size, and good sound. I give these as gifts to friends, my neices and nephews. Perfect for anyone who ever listens to music on their computer. Also good for plugging into a TV, and a walkman - for good sound in any room. I am very happy with my purchase."
3,take it for what it is,"This system is a beginner, entry level system and you should not expect extremely high quality sounds out of it. That being said, it's a nice little system that fits absolutely anywhere (basically why I got it) and plays your music or game soundtracks or whatever. The sub doesn't go very low and the bass control is a little sensitive. You get the bass lines, but not the punchiness from the bass drum-- you're not gonna feel it in your gut like other systems out there. The highs are alright but you kind of get the ""sizzling bacon"" effect from the hi-hat sounds instead of very crisp, tight highs. If you can find this system way on sale, go for it. But if you're going to spend anywhere over $35 dollars on it, get something else like the logitech X230. The PC works is nice, but they give me new respect for my logitech z-3's."
5,Best of the Best,"These have been the best PC speakers for over 10 years, they still rock. I've bought these for work and home and my garage. Don't waste your money on anything else."
5,Very comfortable,"I purchased this based on previous positive reviews. This swing has a sturdy frame, and the cushion is soft and comfortable. All pieces are high quality - including the hanging chains.This product beats any wooden bench-type porch swings. This is the premium seat on our front porch.Highly recommended."
4,It is nice.,"I love the pictures, the instructions. And they are easy to do it, just following the ideas you can create a lot of more."
1,NOT compatible with Motorola i205!,Notice the 2 ears at the top of the holster? The antenna bulge on one side of the i205 and the ear get in each other's way to the point where the phone cannot be holstered. Celui-ci c'est une POS.
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED!,I am a little perplexed by all the glowing reviews - the book is full of pictures and little writing/explanation/discussion of strategy or method. The book is expensive and there are better products on the market - D R SEAMAN is worth checking out and The Science of Streetfighting is an informative read. This book might be useful as a reference tool for practitioners but seems to be more of a compliment to a practising student rather than a stand alone knowledge base.Overated reviews in my opinion - but then there are so many positive reviews I wonder if I am missing something here?
4,Amazingly accurate but too much trapping !!,"Don't get me wrong, this is by far the most complete,up to date, accurate and full of photographs JKD book in the market ! Everything, and I mean really everything of this art is covered with an astonishing amount of pictures. I have never seen a book so loaded with pictures, describing every angle and each and every movement in JKD.So I will not repeat the positive qualities of this book, already very much described in other reviews.On the negative side: complement this book with a more streetfighting oriented book. This book is also very much focused on trapping, tunneling, and related drills which have limited use in real world experience (unless you spend years daily training with them).So, for the phisical preparation, and training, all of these drills are veru useful, but, I would use it only for training purposes."
3,Misunderstood Epidemic Depression,"This video did not make a big impression upon me. It was well done, but I expected more. I believe that if you are looking for information about a mental illness, a collection of information is better than one source only. I have no better suggestion at this time."
2,Worst Designed Iron of the Modern Age,Heal is too small so iron wants to tip over and water window is frosted so it is nearly impossible to see how much water is in iron. It does steam press clothes well however. Keep your receipt. These things have a bad habit of only lasting one or two years.
5,Quality of the vivitar 35mm camera,"From the experience I had with the Vivitar 35mm camera I noted that the quality of the camera and the prints it created were very good. It was easy to handle, had a very convenient automatic flash, and was (to my luck) waterproof. The color and design are also catchy and creative. It gives a spark of color into the drab silver and black world of cameras. I did not own the Vivitar 35mm camera that I used, but it worked so well for me that I went out and ordered my own. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good recreational camera."
1,Thumbs Down!,"Great looking, seems easy to use. But the one I got just didn't work! had to send it back.you get what you pay for!"
2,They changed the eraser!!!,"I have bought these for years. The new once have a much cheaper eraser. They are harder, don't erase as well, and slightly smaller in diameter, so when you go to click for more lead, the top spins..."
3,Not as good as reviewed,"I accidentally received these pencils instead of the Papermate Technician II that I ordered. Tried them out and I'll definitely be returning these for the Technician's. Technician feels much better built and I like the longer non-retractable tip for lead. You do have to be careful because the longer tip can be bent more easily than the retractable type on the Logo. I've carried the Technician in my backpack for years and had a few bent tips but not too bad. This model (the Logo) would not have that problem but I worry about the build quality as the barrel feels much thinner.I was a little surprised at all the positive ratings here since I consider it to be an ""average"" pencil."
2,Not as good as it seems.,"The erasers broke long before they wore out on two of these pencils I purchased. Furthermore, when the eraser breaks, you will have to dig out the remains with a small screwdriver before you can replace it. I would recommend the Pentel Twist-Erase over this product."
3,Get what you pay for I guess,"Pros: It provides you with a nice set of utensils. Lightweight and easy to clean. Makes decent rice.Cons: It takes a little getting use to since you have to figure out which conditions works best for you. Currently, I have only used this for cooking rice. The amount on the instructions are not completely accurate. When cooking my rice the water and rice mixture tends to overflow and leave quite a mess on the bottom of the microwave. The product should've been designed to keep in the overflow."
4,"Works OK, but bigger than I expected","I was looking for a microwave rice cooker for my daughter to take away to college. I know someone who owns the same brand, but a much smaller version. This turned out to be a 12 cup rice cooker, although they don't tell you anywhere how big it is. It's great if you're trying to make larger amounts, but maybe not so practical for keeping in the dorm. Makes good sticky rice for those who prefer. My microwave is lower wattage, so cooked on full power at maximum cooking time and rice came out just as good as from a regular rice cooker."
1,Plastic melted,Cooked about 8 cups of rice and followed directions exactly. When I took it out of the microwave the outer plastic had melted and may have gotten in rice too!
5,lost my instructions!,"This is a great steamer! I know there is an online instruction sheet, but cannot find it. Anyone have a link to it? Thanks so much!"
4,Quick and simple steamed veggies,"Awesome product for those wanting to steam veggies. It's a much cheaper alternative to buying the steamer bags of frozen vegetables in the supermarket. Simply buy bulk frozen (or fresh vegetables, throw them in the steamer, and voila! A healthy meal in minutes. The basket can be a pain to clean which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I have yet to cook rice and pasta in it b/c I'm so lazy that I can't cook my rice and pasta on the stove."
2,"good idea, poor execution","All the components are useful, the concept is great however the darn thing just does not seal. No matter what I do I can't cook pasta in it without it making a mess in the microwave. Followed recommendations regarding power setting and that didn'twork. I cook for myself so I'm not making ""pounds"" of pasta; just enough for me. Took a few shots to get the rice part working, but I have that under control and it does make great rice."
4,How to cook rice,I found the microwave rice cooker to be perfect but it took several tries so get the rice cooked properly.My microwave has reduced power levels so does not boil over as it does with the directions provided with the cooker. I start on high for 3 minutes then drop the power to level 3 and cook for 15 minutes. The rice is perfectly cooked and fluffs up nicely.
5,LOVE MINE!,"I've had one of these since I started college. Over 10 years later I still have it, and it still works great! It was great for the dorm because I could cook full meals in the microwave, now I use it at home; I can start my meals on the stove and throw my rice in the microwave knowing in 12 minutes it will be done perfect.You have to measure out your water and make sure that you use the right ratios and it might splash a little, but the rice turns out great every time (if you follow directions)."
5,Rice is the Life,Greatest thing I have ever purchased by far. I eat rice almost everyday and this handy device is very good at making rice convenient to cook. I have not even used it to its full potential yet but I am sure it will last for a good while.
1,"inexpensive for a reason, buy a better product","The product leaks, I previously owned a pampered chef model which included a rubber ring to seal the moisture inside. This product has nothing, and the starchy liquid leaks out. Also, there were no directions in the box. I had to go on line to get directions."
5,rice cooker,"We looked every where in town for a microwaveable rice cooker and no one carrys them any more.so i got on amazon and found the rice cooker we were looking for. we use it all the time. thank you ,for great price and great shipping time. we know where to go now"
3,"Works like it's supposed to, but is it really necessary.?","This product must be intended for that student or young adult just starting out on their own. Because with this setup and a 1100 microwave you can cook a lot of stuff... The measuring cups and spoons would be helpful as well.For the rest of us this product is superfulous... I tested the rice cooker per directions and it worked just fine.. YOu know what else works fine? My vented Tupperware storage containers. plus those are a lot more versatile.Cooking pasta is more of a hit and miss proposition.... Orzo and Pastina cook well, but your typical long pastas need to be checked periodically to get it right, just like stove top cooking.Additionally i would say the quality is not quite Tupperware standards, which are basically lifetime purchases.I would say a great gift for your child going away or someone setting up house."
4,AWESOME RICE COOKER!,"Someone recommended this for my College bound child. We tried it at home to make sure it would work. Hmmmmmm, thinking about not sending it! This thing is pretty awesome! Comes with a ton of accessories, and works like a dream! Don't loose the instruction book, or you won't know the proportions, I made a pocket on my rice container (tupperware type) and slide it in there. Perfect rice every time with no stirring or burning to the bottom of the pan!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it would cook faster. It still takes 20 minutes, just less mess and fuss."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this item because the price was attractive and I read some decent reviews about it. Every time I cook rice in the microwave, the water overflows and makes a mess and the rice very dry. I have stopped using it. If anyone knows a solution please let me know. I would not recommend this product."
4,not bad,"I have enjoyed using this for rice, but the pasta was a bit of a bummer on my first try. Now I can't find the booklet, so I forgot how much rice to water to use....no biggie."
4,The other reviews were right.,"This thing actually cooks rice perfectly, but like the other reviews say it does leak a bit, even when you set the microwave power level down with a really high wattage microwave. I would still highly recommend it to others looking for a microwave rice cooker, but make sure you put it on a plate in the microwave so that you don't have to clean your microwave after using it."
5,Microwave rice cooker,Best microwave cooker for the money. Works perfectly evry time and is easy to use.
4,Works fine,"This was bought as a gift. The individual who received it has been very happy with it. The only tiny deficiency was in the order of text in the cookbook for cooking pasta. The water has to be hot when you put it in the cooker or the pasta does not cook well and nowhere near the time stated in the cook. A short note that the water is assumed to be hot in the introduction or, alternatively that the water should be brought to a boil in the microwave before adding the pastawould also serve the same purpose"
1,Bad Design - Leaks,Every time I make rice I end up with milky rice water covering the bottom of my microwave. The leaks water from under the lid. I called them because there is a groove in the lid that looks like it would hold some kind of rubber gasket seal to keep the water form boiling out under the lid. They said that that there is no seal. There is no reason not to seal this area because there are vent holes in the top that keep the pressure form building up.
4,Decent Nonya curry,"For those who are connoisseurs of curry chicken dishes from the Straits region- this is the Nonya verson, which tends to be more Malay with a stronger hint of coconut. It is milder (or some will call this ""weak"")with a smoother aftertaste than the Indian chicken curry or the more Chinese version (found in Singapore or Penang). It reminds me of the gravy that you find in the Malay longtong dishes. All in all, pretty decent considering this is a packaged spice. Low additives (e.g. MSG) make this appealing for the more health conscious."
2,AS DRY AS IT GETS,"I read this for the history lesson, to hear about life in the 18oo's in the U.S. It was good that way. The story itself though is really dry. Parched. It was really like reading a slightly more engaging history text book. Very very tough to get through. I had to keep putting it down and giving it a rest. The characters and dialogue are wooden. Petrified. But I stuck it out to hear how tough day-to-day life was only 150 years ago on this continent. Another novel written by a researcher."
5,"Great Book, Great Story; but once again BAD formatting for Kindle","I am giving this 5 stars because it is one of the best books I have ever read. Filled with great characters and interesting plot twists, it is written in beautiful prose. I love the dictionary on my Kindle for the ease with which I could take notes and look up words that were not in my vocabulary.HOWEVER, this is the second Kindle book I have purchased that has major, distracting formatting issues. I pay a premium price, and I think whoever is doing the formatting owes us Kindle users a better product. There were odd spaces, words above and below the baseline, and sometimes fuzzy or ill defined text. I have had issues before with other books. Someone is asleep on quality control, and it disappoints me.I am going to read more by this author for sure!"
4,Very Good,"I enjoyed this book ... I found myself back-tracking on a few pages at times (to review the characters), and I enjoyed it."
3,Not very interesting,"If you've read Lonesome Dove, then you've already read a similar, but much better book (and LD has it's own faults!).This is another book that needs fewer characters with more development.The character Charles was the most developed and his narratives just went on and on. In fact, that is my main complaint with the book: it should have been wrapped up in one tight ending instead of ""this is what happened to Potts, this is what happened to Addington, then this happened to Charles...."". Seemed way too drawn out.Would have rather read about Simon than Charles. The book really grabbed me when Simon was crawling inside the buffalo and then that just got forgotten about.And the resolution of the murder: the reaction seemed a little too ""oh,well I'll be darned"" to be believable. Another missed opportunity to bring excitement into the story.To sum up, fewer pages, more action, more character development of key characters."
2,The book that never ends,"What a struggle to get through this book. I thot it would never end. With all due respect to the author, having read many a fiction and non fiction book about the area in question, Mostly NW Montana, I found this book a most uninteresting, and poorly written novel about both the area and the subject. The writing style was disjointed, the sideline stories were to long and made no realy sense as far as tying in the plot of the book. This book had potential but never made the grade."
5,The writing alone rates,"a top score. The author writes a 19th century novel the way it might have been written 150 years ago. In terms of scope, I think this novel closely resembles A.B. Guthrie's, The Big Sky, more than anything else. It takes time to tackle these Post Modern pieces and it takes a while to care about anyone in here but gradually the reader begins to understand the relationships. A lot of stuff goes unsaid which I think speaks well for any writer. We know that Aloysius is a devoted friend to Custis and we figure it out without being clubbed with it. The relationship between Jerry Potts and Custis also figures in this vein. I would like to have read more of Potts' story. My only criticism and it is mild is that Charles narrates a bit too long.If you want to read something ultimately satisfying in non traditional ways, this might be your ticket."
1,"Rate This "" 0 "" Source Meadia Group Sucks",I received this from Source Media Group and put it in my DVD Player. It would not read the DVD. Tried another DVD Player and still would not read the disk.I tried it in a Computer and it did not see the DVD. The note on the screen said it did not exist.This DVD was a waste of money. WILL NOT ORDER FROM SOURCE MEDIA GROUP AGAIN.THE WARREN MILLER MOVIE IS EXCELLENT. I HAVE WATCHED IT ON VHS. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE! Source Media Group sold me a defective product!!!!
1,not for that price,"I was disappointed that it does not do what it claims, not even close. I bought it and tried to make a few batches that the instruction book said would take 30 minutes. As recommended, I started with cold ingredients. After 50 minutes I still had a soupy mix. If it cost under $100 dollars, maybe I would have learned to deal with it falling below expectations. I returned it. I will give Amazon a lot of credit here, the return process was easy and the refund was expedient."
5,Probably my first - and last - ice cream maker!,"This machine is unbelieveable! I have never made ice cream before until today...My second batch was perfect. My first one, not as much, because I put the ingredients in when they were still warm. Since I am a novice ice cream maker, it's possible that I may have taken the ice cream out too soon, but it was starting to get hard and stick to the sides. (and I had two very excited children waiting to try it) I used a rubber spatula to take it out - a piece of cake! It was a little soft at the end, and had some ice in it, but that's because it should have been cold when I put it in. The second batch was the exact same mix as the first one, but it was much colder because it had to wait for the first one to finish, etc. It was fantastic - 30 minutes to perfection! Save the box when you get it, in case you ever need to ship it for repairs, etc.I posted a vide on You Tube for reference."
3,Is it too hot to make ice cream?,I'm using my new Musso 4080 for the first time during a heat wave (107 this weekend). So far I have not been able to get the ice cream beyond a thick soup stage.
3,Icy Ice Cream,"We received this impressive ice cream maker in a very timely fashion from Amazon. It did, however, arrive with one of the two LCD lights not working. I don't know if that contributed to the overall results of the one batch of ice cream we tried, but our results were unimpressive. What was impressive was Amazon's ease of returning this item. We did have to pay the shipping back, but the cost of the return was refunded to us. I would have preferred being given a shipping label, but otherwise all went well."
2,Get a machine with a removable bowl,"After owning a Simac gelato machine for over 25yrs we finally got tired of sponging out the bowl. The Musso is a similar machine, and will probably last forever just as our Simac has, but keep in mind that you will be sponging out that bowl forever as well.Of course the ice cream is great, all home made ice cream that is done well makes even the best commercial products seem 2nd rate by comparison, but for over $500 you should expect more than just good ice cream."
1,"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless","This review is not based on the operation of the product.With the reduced price & all of the good reviews I decided to order the Musso Lussino. Shipping was fast since I'm a Prime member. Box appeared in decent shape. After opening the box, I took out the machine & the plastic lid had scratches on it. I then looked at the top surface of the machine & there were water stains. The blade had some kind of blemishes on it like it was put through a dishwasher & it damaged the surface. Also in the crevice of the blade there was either rust or food residue. I didn't notice until later there were two types of tape on it. This appears to me as either an open box or returned used item that I received. I wouldn't have cared but the description stated the machine was new. No way it was new based on the condition of the mixing blade. I returned the item & placed another order. Let's see if I receive another open box or used item."
5,We all SCREAM for ice cream.,"Turn on the 4080 Lussino. Then add heavy cream, milk, sugar and vanilla. Thirty seconds later you have the best tasting ice cream."
1,Beyond Disappointing!,"After reading all the great reviews, I was convinced I finally found it, regardless of the price.Schockingly poor! Any ice/water w/ fruit or juice concoction has nothing close to the cosistency of an icee or gelato, not even close. No matter what method or mixture, it is always slush - about the same as a $30 blender?? Ice cream? Again, any combination of heavy cream, ingredient ratio, etc., etc., has a horribly waxy stick to the roof of your mouth feel and taste. Called the manufacturer several times and tried their suggestions - to no avail. One rep. stated not to use heavy whipping cream. Well, where in the world can I find regular non-whipped? Nowhere in this city and I live in one of the top ten in the US. Would that really help? Not sure. Every other sugestion has not worked. And yes, it cools and freezes just fine.If anyone truly understands what I'm speaking about and has any proven suggestions, please share!"
2,Tastes like store bought ice cream,"I had wanted an ice cream maker that makes ice cream like Italian gelato. However, after trying different recipes out, I was disappointed with the machine as I find that there is too much air incorporated into the finished product. It doesn't really taste any different than mass produced, inexpensive supermarket ice cream. I anticipated a product that tasted better than my 20 year old generic machine I purchased in a hardware store. I called the manufacturer and asked a few questions and I was treated very rudely and given explanations that didn't make sense. That is when I decided to return the machine for fear of having problems with the manufacturer in case any problems should arise with the machine in the future. In addition, the machine weighs almost 50 lbs. and takes up a lot of counter space."
1,Dead on arrival,Plugged it in to nearly every outlet in my house but it wouldn't turn on. I sent it back and now I'm debating whether or not to try again or try out the 4090 and save some money. Any recommendations?
5,Forget the Ice Cream - Think Cocktails,"Had ""Girl Night"" the other day. All of my friends want one. You can choose how long to blend your perfect frozen cocktail.Remember the ""slushies"" we had when we were kids, or the endless quest to mix the right amount of flavoring with fresh snow? YummGreat for letting the kids think they are eating a real treat when you are actually slipping them healthy food. Mixed some OJ, cream, agave syrup, & a little vanilla - the 12 yr old boy says it's the best ice cream he's ever had.""Ice Cream"" for breakfast is a fun way to eat some Vitamin C, D, and Calcium.PS - who says you can't clean this thing? Wipe the basin with a clean, wet rag a few times & you're DONE. It doesn't get any easier. Even if you fill it with germs when you're drooling over the fresh dessert, or by licking the last drop from the basin, a quick swipe with a disinfectant (if you're a germaphobe), followed by a clean cloth wipe & you're good to go."
4,fast fast fast!,"This product mostly measures up to all of the other reviews. All I can add is that it IS extremely fast and easy to make ice cream/ gelato/ frozen yogurt, etc. The only thing I disagree about is the cleaning. There is no easy way to empty out the warm/hot water that you clean the tub with. I keep a sponge dedicated to this unit for cleaning, but I never feel like it is truly sanitised between uses. A removable tub or drainage system would be a great improvement. Or, maybe I just don't know the trick to the ""easy cleaning"" that all the other users rave about."
2,No video available to see how this machine works,"I've been searching all over....Google videos, youtube for a meaningful video to see how this machine really works. If there is such a video,well is well hidden.I was expecting to find various videos considering the price. I am very disappointed for not finding one demonstrating how the machine works. If any of the reader post one or find one, please comment on this review. Thank you."
2,Musso 4080 - Doesn't live up to the hype,"This unit comes with a cheap plastic lid - had to sand the bottom rim smooth.After 5 uses the metal housing started vibrating very loudly during the entire 40 minutes it took to make the ice cream.If you over set the timer there's no way to turn it off.On the good side it does the job and is easy to clean up bu not worth the big bucks they want for the unit.And to think it was ""Martha Stewart"" recommended once upon a time."
4,Ten Years After......,"I have had this unit for ten years now and it is still going strong. I use in now a days just about twice a month. At times I've let it sit and had other desserts but most of the time I have one or two flavors of my home made i/c in the freezer. The reason I gave it only four stars is that it is pretty loud, the beater that is. The sound changes some (gets quieter) as the batch gets thicker and that is a clue to the ice cream being ready to scoop out, but still louder then I'd like. For instance I can't read or listen to the radio in between filling and emptying the machine. Over all a great item if you love homemade frozen desserts.KDM"
5,You get what you pay for!!!,"Since buying this machine some 4 months ago I have not ever regretted the purchase. I have found that when using pasteurized eggs and other chilled ingredients that it is possible to be eating fresh ice cream within 20 minutes. Like everyone else says ""let the bowl chill for about 5 minutes prior to adding the mixture"" and will you also be more than satisfied with this product as well."
5,Great Hammock,"This hammock is the most comfortable hammock I've ever had the pleasure of being on. I much prefer the cloth over regular rope hammocks. It is a very stable hammock, easy to get on (and stay on) and easy to get off. I would recommend this hammock to anyone looking to purchase!"
5,So light and cool!,Down here in southern Mississippi you can sit inside with the AC in summer or hang a hammock in the shade - but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it's so lightweight I prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it's so durable. I've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat. The grandbaby loves it!
2,Just Okay Laptop,"Bought this laptop a little over a year ago to use now and then when traveling. Shipped with battery virtually dead and wouldn't hold a charge only after 10 minutes of use. Used it mostly with the power cord and it worked okay for first six months then starting having general issues with the computer. Also, Laptop did not come with wireless card. I purchased a wireless card and then I had to change the computer Bios to get the wireless card to work. The bios change did work although very risky to do this. Then after about a year the computer won't power on the display - although the laptop powers on. Just an okay computer and would not buy another after issues and problems."
4,Clarion For Windows For Dummies,"If you develop software in TopSpeed or Clarion, there isn't a lot a material out there to help you learn. The book covers Clarion for Windows 2.0. You might be able to adapt some of the material in this book to Clarion for Windows 4.0 or Clarion for Windows 5.0. You will not find any help on the ABC Templates or using OOP. This book does have quite a few errors but since reference material for Clarion is very rare, you must overlook them. This book will not help solve any real world issues that you may encounter but may help with some minor issues or how-to-do things. I spent 6 1/2 years developing with Clarion and everyday seemed to be a headache but I am thankful for the ""For Dummies"" people (Tom Moseley and Jim Defabia) for writing this book. Without it, I would have been totally lost. (I know, some people think that I am totally lost anyway!!!)"
4,Summer Fun,"I saw this made for TV movie when it first came out. I taped it to VHS and had it for many years but lost or misplaced it. I watched this over and over, probably wore out the tape. I have been looking for it for many years even bought a poor copy off ebay. This DVD-R version was very good for the era in which the movie was made. Good quality picture and sound. Great summer beach fun."
1,Not a Chinois,"This product is not a chinois, as the industry understands it. It is a ""china cap,"" or to use a more PC description ""a cone strainer."" I would submit that any serious chef would gawk at the price because they would find [$$$] to be a great deal, and should shop with that in mind. The point is that you could strain a stock through this thousands of times and end up with a cloudy, unsilken sauce. ... Know your lingo, what you're willing to spend on what you want, and whether or not you really need it--pay the money for the real thing instead of a misnamed product. ..."
2,Holes are just too large,"Before purchasing this item I read the other reviews where overly-large holes were mentioned. I figured it would probably be ok for my purposes -- I am no professional chef. However, the holes are so large that I really can't imagine what you would be able to use it for. I resorted to using cheesecloth in conjunction with this chinois, but what a pain! Since every other chinois I've seen is far more expensive (you get what you pay for), I am going to shop for a stainless steel strainer with a fine mesh and see if I can make do with that."
2,not for the professional chef,I purchased this for a chef and the strainer is not fine enough. There should be an choice of the strainer as far as fineness.
3,Doesn't sound like a chinois to me,"From everyone's description of this product, we in the industry call it a china cap. A chinois is the ultra fine mesh used to make sauces silken. A china cap is a very useful tool, but not for the serious straining only a chinois, or maybe a tamis, is good for."
1,Don't buy it.,"I purchased this a year ago, used it twice (actually, once and a half!)and it fell apart. I was right in the middle of a large recipe and the cap at the point of the cone fell off. Definitely not a good product."
3,China cap chinoise correction...,"There is a previous review that mentions a china cap as the tool for finer sauces but I disagree. ""Wiki"" it to be sure. Just didn't want any confusion."
3,works great but loooks cheap,core unit that sharpens pencil is sturdy but its casing is made of very thin metallic strip which looks cheap. Screwing the unit on desk is also not that simple as the base of the unit is very small and you can't push screw vertically as handle comes in the way. They should have increased the area of base for ease of fixing. Otherwise unit works great.
1,sending it back,"Received this today and I'm so disappointed. Like other reviewers said, the pencils sharpened on one side. I tried all sorts of things but just couldn't get good results consistently. I dream of the old pencil sharpener attached to the garage wall in the house where I grew up. Wish I could find one of those!"
2,Piece of junk,"I previously went modern and bought an iPoint. It worked fine the first ten times I used it and then became ill. It begins to sharpen and then stalls because the motor is too week. I opened it and oiled it and looked for obstructions. Did not help. Another cheap piece of junk that is becoming the way of manufacturing. Make it cheap as possible to increase profits and hope it lasts a few months.I was ready to go back to the manual type I grew up with and figured after making them for so many decades, they must have it perfected. Nope. The first pencil I tried to sharpen came out with a lopsided tip. Wood on one side extending almost to the tip. I thought maybe the pencil was off center so used a hand held sharpener. It is now perfect. This sharpener also wants to eat the pencil and does not know when it is sharp. Maybe I can find a good used sharpener in an antique store."
3,Review,"After purchasing this rather well made X-acto sharpener made in China I ended up returning it due to the short point. I like a long point pencil like the old Boston of yesteryear. The sharpener has two cutting wheels, which is good, but for some reason they did not design in the same point as the old Boston after which this new sharpener is modeled. Again, the sharpener is well made and would rate a five star by me if I liked the short point."
1,Did not last a year.,I thought this pencil sharpener would last for years but it did not last more than a year. The retainer arm that keeps the size adjustment wheel in place slowly became loose and no longer lines up the pencil in the center of the sharpener. Most pencils come out lopsided. I'm very disappointed and am looking to replace this poorly made product.
3,It's nice but construction is pretty cheap,Bought this for my daughters playroom so she can sharpen pencils on her own. This is a functional product but very cheap construction. Serves the purpose well but goes to the old saying that they don't make them like they used to!!
5,Wall mount sharpner,This sharpener is a great product. i have used electric and other manual pencil sharpeners but this is by far the best.
1,not like they used to be,"I have this pencil sharpener and it eats up pencils. By the time I can get a descent point on a brand new pencil, it is usually whittled down to 2-3"" long. It also only sharpens one side despite rotating the pencil"
1,Do not buy this,"This got to be the only time I have bothered returning a product that cost $12. While seemingly solid, it sharpened the point of the pencil roughly mid way between edge and center of the pencil. So manufacutring tolerances could be improved slightly..."
4,Great unit!!!,"I must have purchased about six of the simple one dollar version of the pencil sharpeners but they all fail after some simple usage.This pencil sharpener is a great addition to the home office for the kids pencils. Pencils are sharpened quickly and cleanly without breakage. No electricity required, just a few simple turns of the handle and you are done."
4,Pencils need this!,I bought the X-Acto pencil sharpener for my grandchildren because they break their pencil points like crazy when they do their homework. They love it! It just needed to be broken in at first because it was hard for them to turn but it works fine now. I had to get another grandchild one as well & he's pleased as punch. Thanks for having what we needed when we needed it Amazon!
2,It works but came with no screws.,"I ordered my sharpener from OrangeOnions. I don't know if it was their fault or the manufacturer, but my box came with no mounting screws. Also, the screw holes on the unit are very small, I drilled mine out some in order to get a #6 screw through there. Additionally, at least one screw hole is partially blocked by the sharpener when you go to screw it in, meaning it helps to have a jointed bit holder.Once mounted, it works ok. It sharpens a bit unevenly, and my six-year old cannot use it by himself, but if you rotate the pencil a little while sharpening it will give a good point.I'd probably go with a more expensive model if I bought another one."
1,bent sharpener,This product arrived bent and beat up. I was disappointed by the thin metal and poor quality. Do not buy this. Choose another sharpener.
1,Doesn't sharpen all around the tip,"The sharpener is the useless one I had so far. It doesn't remove the wood all around the lead tip, only half side of the lead is exposed and got so frustrated to make it work in all the settings. Pretty useless junk."
1,piece of junk,"Garbage. Sharpens pencils on an angle. Cheaply made. Cover comes off if you barely touch it. Feels like it is made of tin. The good reviews cannot be for this product, or they are employees/relatives/owner of the company. I will have to look for a quality, American made product like my last sharpener that lasted 50+ years. A good sharpener of this type would weigh a pound, not several ounces."
5,very useful for my needs,I use pencils often.makes nice point.easy to use.kinda reminds me of school days.good strong quality.don't think this will wear out any time soon
4,Just like the ones from elementary school!,"After trying and tossing a few electric pencil sharpeners, we decided to go old school with this one. We did install it with longer screws than those that were included in the package, just to be sure it would stand up to two boys frequent use.It's wonderful...no more half eaten pencil ends with the wood still covering the lead! It might not be a sturdy as the ones actually in elementary schools, but I fully expect it to last much longer than the electric models that cost the same or more."
1,Terrible Pencil Sharpener,"This pencil sharpener is terrible. The front silver part frequently falls off when my kids bump it even a little. When you sharpen your pencil, it either breaks the lead or only sharpens one side, leaving wood along the top of the pencil. We home school so we need a good pencil sharpener, save your money. This is not it."
3,Works fine,"THis sharpener works just fine. It is not the highest quality. But, I suppose that you get what you pay for and at the end of the day it does the job."
2,Not easy to use,"We bought this to use at home. It was a bit difficult to mount on the table because the screws were small the sharpener body was in the way of the screw holes. It did not work as well as expected. It takes a bit of hand power. My five year old could not do it by herself. I should have bought an electric one instead. However, the price was good. You get what you pay for."
4,"Not like I remembered, but good.","This sharpener is pretty dang close to the one I grew up with. Shave off a few milimeters of thickness and you've got this. So far, it has worked great for our Kindergartner who beats it up a bit. Honestly, for the price - if it lasts even a year, I won't be sad. But I have high hopes for even longer!"
5,No school like the old school,"I grew up with one of these in everyone of my classrooms as well as one in our home garage. My wife had my children (6 through 9) brainwashed into using the noisy crap plastic electric one on her desk. I purchased and installed this unit in our garage, and it turns your pencil into a finely sharpened instrument of learning... or torture. LOVE IT!"
2,"Reliable, but not as easy as I remember","Our daughter was starting kindergarten, and we wanted a simple reliable sharpener that would last her through her school years. An added bonus was that we didn't have to worry about where to plug it in, or replacing batteries.However, my memory of these sharpeners being easy to use doesn't match up with today's experience. While sharpening a standard #2 pencil the handle is difficult to turn, and a young child may have trouble grasping the pencil tight enough to keep it from turning. It also doesn't center the pencil perfectly, so you have to turn it some while sharpening to keep a consistent point. Yes, it will last a long time. Unfortunately, it will be me using it, and not our young daughter. Wish I'd have gone for the electric."
5,End the sharpener search,"This was an awesome problem solver for our home! Easy to mount on the wall and even the 5 yr old can empty the shavings and remount the case. Adjustable to work for those kindergarten size pencils too. Very good value for the price!I was totally sick and tired of having to wait for kids to hunt down a sharpener every time I asked them to write something. When archeologists unearth our house in 500 years, they will find those dollar sharpeners everywhere embedded in the woodwork. That must be where they are hiding because they are never where we need them."
2,Pencil sharpener,Can not stand a dull pencil.. Thought this would be great...the screwed don't hold the sharpener so it's useless if you can't hold it down..
1,Hate it!,This sharpener does not sharpen the pencils well atall. I have tried everything and it still leaves some wood on at least one side of the pencil lead everytime.
1,Disappointed Teacher,"As usual X-Acto has somehow managed to de-evolve the pencil sharpener. My first experience with X-Acto was with a simple electric sharpener. The quick convenience I had taken for granted with my Boston 19 was not possible with my new five-minute-per-pencil X-Acto. My next experience was with the $130 + ""heavy duty"" X-Acto in the department center in my school. Well before the end of the year it was simply an impressive looking paper weight. Finally, this rotary model was installed in my classroom. Basically, it ate every pencil at an impossible-to-write with angle. I tried out three others in neighboring classrooms. I did not have the same problem; rather, the others were worse: noisy, grinding pencil crushers that no student would use. My only option is to stock up on the small plastic manual sharpeners that frequently break but at least manage to sharpen a couple of pencils before they bite the dust. That's much more than I can say for my X-Actos."
2,You're taking a chance buying this,"The quality control on this sharpener isn't very good as the mixed reviews attest. I've gone through two of these units, and the first one was a dud.Do not believe the ""wall mount"" bit. The mounting flange on the sawdust collector only accommodates mounting it as pictured. If you do the logical thing and rotate it so the dust collector is vertical, the mounting flanges bend.That means you can't rotate the dust collector 90 degrees if you elect to mount the sharpener on the wall. Yes, it works but as soon as you remove the dust bin to empty it, you'll have sawdust on the floor. And remove it you will because the collector doesn't work very well when it's mounted sideways.It works, but just barely. It's a poor copy of the old Boston sharpener."
1,Think twice before ordering,"I ordered an X-Acto KS sharpener on the basis of the Boston and X-Acto brand recognition. The first pencil sharpened perfectly. After that, all pencils were sharpened off-center, so that wood was left on one side of the lead, all the way to the point. On top of that, the feature that was supposed to prevent over-sharpening only worked for the first pencil. The rest would continue to be ground away, until there was no more pencil left. I dug around in my garage and found an old, beat-up Boston KS sharpener, made in the USA, and it worked better than the new, made in China one. The difference in quality was apparent, even though the old one was well-used and abused."
2,Gambled and lost.,I was disappointed that this sharpener cut pencils off center. Pencils wouldn't write due to wood on one half the lead tip. It seems well made but lacked the precision.
1,eats your pencil,This sharpener eats the pencils and coloring pencils. We homeschool and use alot of pencils but this didnt live up to its other reviews in our home.:(
4,Like it,"I've been wanting a manual pencil sharpener for some time. I finally made the plunge with a little birthday money, and bought this sharpener. I like it. I got tired of dealing with the electric sharpener we had--battery replacement and all. This gives me more variety in pencil sizes too. I can control the speed at which I sharpen. I can feel when the pencil is actually sharp, and hence know when to stop. I find that I am less likely to break the nib. I'm glad I purchased it."
3,Screws all snapped...,"The sharpener looks like it will be fine, if we can ever get the thing mounted. The heads of ALL THREE screws snapped while my husband was tightening them. So the hardware that comes with the sharpener is pretty much useless."
1,Sharpens just one side,"I prefer mechanical sharpeners because they sharpen as no electric one does, keeping the lead long and the wooden part intact. This X-Acto only sharpens one side of the pencil and leaves wood on the other side. Also, it destroys pencils if you insist on sharpening. It is nothing like the mechanical sharpeners that I'm used to."
4,pencil sharpener,"I really like my pencil sharpener, it is a lot easier than using one of those little plastic ones or even a kitchen knife.I like the fact that it has steel blades on the inside, I know it will last longer than plastic ones.My only problem with this item, is where the screw holes are in the base of the sharpener. The placement of the holes made it a little more difficult to get the screws in, but after a time I made it.I would recommend this item to anyone."
2,"Flimsy, sharpens off center","This is a cheap pencil sharpener, and it shows. The construction is flimsy and the sharpener consistently sharpens off center.It does provide a nice sharp tip, but when that tip is half wood and half lead it is useless. It is possible to use this sharpener to sharpen on center but you have to really work at it and often waste inches of pencil trying again and again. It shouldn't be this hard to use a sharpener.I recommend that you find an alternative sharpener."
5,The sharpest sharpener!,"I've tried all types of sharpeners, elect, those small plastic things,nothing like the thing we all remember having as kids, still the best way to sharpen any pencil!"
4,Good Pencil Sharpener,"We are provided with these sharpeners by the district that I work with. When I first entered my new classroom, I had one that was not working properly. I requested a new one and I loved it! It is quick and leaves pencils sharp. This is of course if you do the sharpening.If you have little ones (1st grade and under) they tend to take some time doing the sharpening. The sharpener will also eat the pencil if you allow it to. Overall it is a good sharpener that will last all year.The shavings were also thrown away about 3 times a week. I believe this has to do more with the pencils that needed constant sharpening. If you have good pencils it will probably last all week before needing to empty it."
1,Don't get this one!,"If you want pencils with lop-sided points that are ground to a nub then this is your model. I returned mine. After 3 tries, I found the one I had been looking for: the Bostitch ""Antimicrobial!"" It works perfectly. Save yourself some disappointments and get the Bostitch. A bit more expensive but worth it."
1,4 Stars for this piece of junk? I think not!,"I agree with the last reviewer. Cover doesn't line up right resulting in unevenly sharpened pencils. Piece of junk! I am so tired of playing with it, came on to Amazon today so I could order something else. Saw this one near top of the results and am now all riled up. I'm sure I bought it because of the 4 stars. Buyer beware!"
2,X Acto pencil sharpener,"Overall, this pencil sharpener looks great and is high quality. But, that is as far as it goes; the cutters are so course and very sharp that they tend to grab and turn the pencil instead of cutting it. If you hold the pencil tight, it will cut and sharpen the pencil but usually not at the right angle. It tends to pull the pencil to the side so the point doesn't hit the stop and it just keeps sharpening. The older manual sharpeners would only rarely offset the cut, so something isn't designed as well."
3,For the most part.....,It's ok. The one big problem I have with it- it only sharpens on one side. Still leaves a bit of the wood all the way to the tip on one side.
4,Works Good,"Hi This pencil sharpener works good, but is not as well made as the really old ones. The metal is thinner and it's not as good quality as the one I had as a child. It is, however, reasonable for today's workmanship."
2,"Not so ""sharp""","I thought this was going to be a good sharpener, but it doesnt matter what pencil I use, it just does not sharpen well at all. I'm about to pitch it in the trash. Only one side of the pencil sharpens while the wood remains on the other half, making it impossible to write with. It's junk."
3,Of fair quality,I just remember the sharpeners we had at school when I was a kid and they were a little more stout. I mounted this one in the garage and it's fine (certainly for the price).
2,desk-mount does not mean suction,"I was under the impression that, like most desk-mount sharpeners, this one had a vacuum/suction mount (little lever to make it stick to the desktop). This one is screw-mount only. Now I've got to find a place in my house that I feel like drilling holes for a pencil sharpener. Not happy."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to buy an oldschool type pencil sharpener for our home, but have been very disappointed in this product. It simply does not sharpen well. The pencil either comes out not sharpened, or slightly mangled, sometimes both."
3,Hmmmm,It sharpens just like I remember back in elementary school. But beware of the mounting screws that come with it. They snapped in half while trying to mount it!
4,Works Fine,"I have an old Boston sharpener in my garage, and really like it. I wanted one for the cabin, and the X-Acto appeared to be the closest thing to the Boston that was available today. I read the reviews, and noticed people were either really happy or not. I decided to give it a try, and hoped for the best. While it's not quite as substantial as my old Boston, looks the same and it sharpens pencils well and accurately. For the money, I have no complaints."
3,Sweet cycle of life story,"This is one of those books that attempts to teach wisdom.Josh delivers meals on wheels and one of the recipients (William Davis) asks him to work on a project with him; he asks Josh to record some of his stories.Through the telling of the stories he tries to guide Josh through the issues Josh faces in his family life and to impart an ability to look differently at the world, making some of the things we go through easier to take.There is a cycle of life message and there are messages about regret, obstacles, love, family, adventure.Despite the messages it contains, some of the language it uses and an underlying faith, it isn't a preachy book, so it succeeded in making me pause occasionally to reflect. What you get out of the book will depend on where you are in your own journey, but it is unlikely to offend and is probably worth the time it takes to read."
3,"Sweet story. Well told. No new point of view, though . . .","While I enjoyed this gentle story about a boy at the beginning of this life making a connection with a man at the end of his journey, there was really nothing compelling or ""new"" about the plot.The book followed a predictable plot line and ended as expected.What came in the middle were some good lessons, but I feel the author could have done so much more with the two main characters.A light, quick read with nothing much to ""think about"" after the last page has been turned."
2,Didn't like it,Very small book and very simple decorations. The best pictures are the ones on the cover. Do not recommend it at all.
5,Great for Youngsters,the book is set up simply for the younger decorator to read and follow along easily. Simple but fun and impressive results are easy.
4,amazing cakes,I bought this book so that I could have my three year old granddaughter help me. This book is wonderful. All the ideas are easy and each one is explained well. It was in excellent condition and arrived before the promised date.
4,Advance Copy,"I received an advance copy of this book to review. It was a great read. Every baseball fan, whether historian, coach, or player can benefit from reading the book. The author gets into his picks for top ten bunters ever, and there are a few suprises. The pictures really help if you're reading to learn. I recommend it for every level of baseball."
3,A Niche Product,"""Exploring Lewis and Clark"" makes some interesting points about Lewis & Clark, somewhat in the spirit of being the devil's advocate.Slaughter is clearly trying to draw a contrast between the worshipful view of L&C; popularized by Stephen Ambrose and Ken Burns and what Slaughter views as the reality. Slaughter notes, for instance, that L&C; hunted excessively, repeatedly stole from Indians, and generally exaggerated their historical importance. Slaughter also has a very interesting discussion of the life of Sacajawea and the possibility she lived longer than is conventionally acknowledged.All this said, this is very much a niche product. One has to know a great deal about the L&C; journey prior to reading this book. I would also suggest that it's a relatively thin book. I think Slaughter's interesting points probably could have been presented in 30 or 40 pages, but he has puffed it up to somewhat get to a book length."
1,Creative pseudo-history,"Slaughter's book is, by far, one of the least enjoyable and befuddling 'history' books that I have ever read. The book is not a historical hack-job, for Slaughter knows his subject and has created a well-documented and researched work. The problem, though, is his flagrant revisionist bias, barely concealed throughout the book both in tone and content. I would strongly recommend more straightforward history tomes rather than this speculative retelling that places Slaughter in the shoes of Lewis & Clark... as though he knew their very thoughts. In fact, only Lews & Clark were themselves, and knew their thoughts."
1,Deconstructing Lewis And Clark,"If you think Lewis and Clark would have been better off on a voyage of discovery via peyote buttons, to their inner selves in the Mandan spirit world, rather than heading for the Pacific Ocean, this is the book for you.If you think they were just racist, sexist, homophobic, Christian, Euro-centric males out to take credit for the discoveries of the minority groups they were exploiting, you've hit the mother lode here.If you are searching for an example of the sorry state of American history as it is presented in academia (the author is a professor at Notre Dame), you need look no further.Some might call it an embarassing attempt to cash it on the popularity of Ambrose's UNDAUNTED COURAGE. Others might call it a pathetic attempt to exploit that book's popularity. I find both viewpoints to be useful -- EXPLORING LEWIS AND CLARK is embarassing AND pathetic."
3,Great as long as it lasts,They are great speakers with great bass for a couple of years but then the amp burns up. This was my second set of these powered speakers and they both lasted about 2 years and then the amp burns up.
4,Good CD,"I got this for my almost 6 year old daughter and I have this in my car and play it everytime I pick her up from school. Recently, she just had a High School Musical themed b-day party and it was a hit with her classmates. Ofcourse, I just had to play the CD during her party and they enjoyed listening, singing and dancing to it."
5,high school musical 2,My daughter loved it as much as the first. It is a fun cd for kids of all ages
3,I AM SO ASHAMED.,"I can't believe that i listend to it and liked. i cant' believe i went out and bought it. i can't believe it was any good. But if you put aside all the horrible merchandise this silly little franchise has created and just listen to the music, you find it's enjoyable pop music. that isn't too offending for anyone to listen to. having once been a huge fan of bsb, britney spears, christina aguilera, nsync, you miss the harmless pop music of the later 90s. and it just brings all that happy pop goodness with the album. you are the music in me has horrible cliche lyrics and a awesome freakin melody. What time is it also suffers the same fate. but it's all about the production here. and it works."
4,My 8-year old loves it,"For my own purposes, I'd never listen to this adolescent drivel. But, it's not meant for me, it's meant for kids, most of which are probably under 10. My 8-year-old loves it and often sings and dances to it. So... given it's intended audience... I'd have to rate it 4 of 5!"
3,High School Musical 2,"Decent, but not as entertaining or fresh as the first. Appealing to kids under 14."
2,"Not even close to ""Fabulous""","Although much, MCUH better than the first movie this movie and soundtrack was much more mature and the movie actually was okay. The main parts of the soundtrack are as horrible as the first however for this soundtrack a few songs caught my attention.Fabulous was a catchy, hilarious song that I quite enjoyed.I Don't Dance was a good song as well because Ryan(Lucas Grabeel) sang it.You Are The Music In Me sung by Sharpay(Ashley Tisdale) was also amusing in multiple ways.However the rest of the album such as Work It Out and Bet On It were horrible and had idiotic lyrics like the first."
1,Oh Please,give me a break high school musical has always sucked but when the second one came out me and my friends had a good laugh i mean seriously the second one was worse than the first. i didnt even think it was possible. Congrats.
1,i wish i could give it negative stars,"these songs were trash and the movie was also, the i give all my love to the 1st one it was a classic but the second one was awful just total trash, the music numbers was garbage only thing ok was the storyline, the acting was overdoing it and the dancing was looking like somebody with ADD made it, well if you did like your must be crazy i pray the 3rd one will be better because this one was a disgrace to the 1st one a plus 3.0 million budget aint help jack all they all want to do is milk this for as long as they can and hope they wont do this to the 3rd on only reason i will buy the dvd, watch this again on tv and buy the CD because ashley tisdale is pretty and her and vanessa have a nice singing voice"
4,cd,"my neices really enjoyed this cd a lot.I liked the fast shipping, and I would do business with this seller again."
4,CD,The teenager in your life will have to have this CD HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2!! The music is inspiring and you will hear them singing and see them dancing along with this one..a great gift!!
1,Do not use this seller!,"Do not purchase this or any other product fron this seller. The product is not as advertised, and seller does not respond to e-mails. and has no other contact information. Amazon is susposed to be investigating this seller and refunding my money."
2,Waste of money,"I have several fountain pens, including a Waterman sterling silver cartridge model that I got a few years ago as an anniversary gift from my employers (as a large, faceless bureaucracy, they took no part in the selection).I use this one whenever I need to sign documents in blue ink - probably once every couple of months, on average, but a lot of documents at a time, for real estate transactions, and using a ball-point puts too much strain on my fingers.Because the Waterman cartridges dry out so quickly, I have to use a new cartridge every time, which is (a) an annoyance, and (b) an outrageous expense in terms of value for money (and yes, I can afford the few dollars I shell out every year or so). I use the Parker 51 that my parents gave me for Christmas in 1964 for writing notes, more or less daily, but I am probably on my 4th bottle of Parker Quink over a period of more than 40 years.I give two stars for the attractive color of the ink."
5,Halloween Costume,The Halloween Costume was great. The quality was better than expected and it was a great hit with my child. THANKS!
4,Good Halloween outfit from amazon,"Good for what it was. Pants were a bit big for my 8 yrs old nephew. I wouldn't say this would hold up to alot of wear and tear, but it was good for a night or two and the price was good."
5,Butter Warmer/Mini Fondue Set,"I love using this set when we have crab legs or lobster. I like to add a pinch or two of herbs or garlic to the butter as it melts for added flavor. My favorite treat is to heat a small serving of chocolate fondue in the microwave and use one of the warmers as a personal fondue pot.I think the height is just right and haven't had any trouble with the butter or chocolate burning. Well the chocolate really isn't around long enough to burn! At any rate, I think this a nice set that's worth owning or giving as a gift. It definitely gets the job done and adds a nice classy touch to the table."
2,Would love to give 5 stars,"These little warmers are ideal. They work perfectly well keeping the butter at a perfect temperature -- not too cool nor too hot. So why only two stars? The dishes will break, as ceramic can do. They are evidently not replaceable. I have searched high and low and in nearly every town and city, shop and outlet. The dishes alone do not exist. You can find straight-sided ramekins but they don't fit in the holder. I will not be buying these again."
1,I wish I could give this a zero,"Horrible acting, Matt Busch should stick to drawing. The entire movie looks like it was shot with a cell phone camera. The plot was lame, the execution was pathetic, and Busch is just a fat, egotistical clown that NEEDS attention.If this is what passes for horror, you should pick up 'Pretty Woman' or 'The English Patient' for a better scare."
5,You have to love puppets!,"I would only recommend these for people or children that have a true interest in Sesame Street, and in puppetry. Otherwise, they may seem boring to a 'video game kid.' My husband and I put on a show for our 20 month old and she laughed and watched our performance for at least a half of an hour. She LOVES Sesame Street... and ANYTHING Elmo!"
4,Great quality! Love it!,I found these puppets before Christmas and my extended family bought these for my 1 and 3 year old daughters. Both of my daughters love the puppets at the library - so I thought it would be fun to have some puppets at home.The quality of these puppets is great & Sesame Street is tried and true. They were both very excited when they opened all 8 puppets up on Christmas eve. We absolutely love them - the only downside is that some of the mouths are pretty hard to move. As an adult - I can't really move the mouth and move the arms at the same time. I anticiate that the mouths will loosen up a bit over time - but for now - my older daughter loves just putting them on and pretending to talk. Both girls love watching when we do a puppet show.
3,yet another inspirational tale on how to succeed setting and meeting goals,"Nothing to object to in this book about a boy was born into poverty with a hit and miss father and a mother with a *heavy hand* but the iron will necessary to raise boys in dire straits. But, the real secret to Mr Brooks personal success is, I suspect, due to his own self confidence which he admits he had from day one. And his natural ability and a good physical body couldn't have hurt him much either.I bought it for my grandson thinking it would offer some football advice and not life advice. Not enough football."
3,Great playing ... far from the adventure's realm.,"Nice atmosphere...relaxed mood (Ballads & Blues is the first title of this record), with some few moments of climax in stratospheric heights -upper register blowing is really a familiar place for him- and some small exploration on the jungle...but mainly focused in a on-the-tradition flavour and conventional treatment of the songs, than in dangerous avantgarde explorations... maybe the tunes and the moment and the audience carry him to this readings...anyway, great music with some superb moments... the surrendering entering of ""You've changed"", the exploration around ""I can't get started"" and personally speaking, the delightful covering of ""Darian"", a tune from the inspired guitarrist Ted Dunbar, also himself in splendid form, are among the nicest and more shocking moments of this pretty record... specially indicated for sweet & passion moments."
3,Some small mistake,"As you probably have already seen... the Ted Dunbar's tune about I'm talking is ""Rare Moments""...I apologize."
3,Deanna Durbin package,"Viewed two of the movies so far. One was very good - good quality picture.One of the movies was not up to par with other Durbin pics. It is titled ""Can't Help Singing""."
1,a synopsis of her carerr,Deanna was blessed with a great talent and displayed it aptly in 3 Smart Girls. The problem is that her bosses did not know what a talent they had and miscast her and kept trying to change her persona. Lady on a Train was the nadir of her career. A truly great talent wasted
4,Good stuff here....if you have a song in your heart....,"The movies are good, but nothing is better than hearing Deanna Durbin sing away.Im a great fan of Jeanette Macdonnald and Nelson Eddy 's movies and music buti knew there was more great stuff that i heard when i was younger.. Now partof the puzzle has been found...its Deanna Durbin... So glad to have found thatvoice again...and now its on to her movies. Great bubbly youngster for herfirst films to a fine young women in her later films. Thanks Deanna !"
3,Unusual Format,"I assume you don't need a movie review here. If you're thinking about buying this set, you know who Deanna Durbin is. The question is whether this is one of those horrible transfers that looks like someone copied it from VHS tape. The quality is OK, but not stunning. The 2 disk format might be a surprise though.I bought a copy of this several years ago when it first came out, loaned it and it never came home, so I decided to replace it. My original set had each movie on a separate disk - a boxed set. This set has all the movies crammed onto 2 double-sided disks. If you're expecting a box set - surprise! Note that down in the product details it says ""2 disks"". I have no particular attachment to the physical format unless extra compression is required to get them all on 2 disks."
5,Bravo Deanna,"My two favorites here are Lady On A Train and Cant Help Singing(Deanna in Color.First time only time.)And in a Western.WOW.(Sort of a Western Version of the Clark Gable classic,It Happened One Night.)Pretty good Jerome Kern Score.First Love was Deannas first of two films with the future Eliot Ness(Robert Stack).Three Smart Girls,It Started With Eve, and Something In The Wind are the weakest,but still worth seeing.(Its too bad the Film Noir Christmas Holiday and Hers To Hold were not used.Its not a perfect world.)Sadly, Deanna had only a limited amount of films.Some people who never worked with her are,Fred Astaire,Errol Flynn,Frank Sinatra,Mickey Rooney,James Cagney,Bing Crosby,Phil Silvers,Howard Keel,and Gordon McRae.)Getting back to the set.If your a Deanna Durbin fan,this is for you."
3,sometimes i enjoy an american cheese sandwich on white bread with mayonaisse ...,"several movies taken through the decade of her career in hollywood. pleasant froth, entertaining as far as it goes, but not much to add."
4,"Note: ""100 Men and a Girl"" no longer in DVD set","Unlike what Amazon's page and another reviewer indicate, it seems that in this DVD set ""100 Men and a Girl"" has now been replaced by ""Something in the Wind.""Since ""100 Men and a Girl"" is considered one of her best movies and the replacement is considered one of her worst, I assume that the DVD studio was unable to obtain the necessary rights and was forced to find another Durbin film to fill the slot."
2,Disc problems!,"The six films featured on the Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack are excellent. However, the method Universal uses to squeeze two films on to one side of a disc results in one of those films freezing on play back. As a result I can only award two stars instead of the five that it would otherwise get."
5,Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack,"This was an excellent buy. It Has various titles, comedies , mysteries and who could not like the voice .well done Deanna"
3,Worth the effort,"One needs to be familiar with conventional Roberts,otherwise this is confusing. Worth the effort if you are in that environment."
4,The best show I've ever seen,I really glad that I took the time to buy this these season.I've like 24 from since it came out on tv. Now that It's on Dvd Iwant to watch them over and over again.
1,Check the Pricing,"This review is based on pricing not on content.This ""slim"" edition is $53.99. The same season in what is I can only suppose is the ""non-slim"" edition is $34.49. What value does the slim addition bring that is worth $19.50? There doesn't seem to be any additional features. You would think the reduced packaging costs for the slim edition would would justify a price DECREASE not a price increase. (Prices based on listings on the date of the review)"
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,"I purchased this item with some gift cards. It is really junk and I am sorry I ever purchased it. After one use it reads only 300 degrees, no more! The needle is exposed and not inside a sealed glass, so there is life span problems from the git-go. The package it comes in makes it appear to have a glass cover. Save your money and buy a useful item for your grill."
5,buggybagg,This is a great product and I recommend this to anyone who has a little one that will be going shopping with you. Shopping carts are nasty. I definitely do not want my daughter putting her mouth on the dirty handles of shopping carts. The other nice thing is its comfortable for my daughter to sit in. No hard plastic seat and metal back rest. Just buy it. It will only take you a few seconds to install in any shopping cart and you will feel better knowing that the germs on the cart will not be passed on to you son/daughter.
5,Best cart cover ever,I love this Buggybagg shopping cart cover. It is the best cart cover ever. My baby loves it and so does my husband. He is very picky about everthing that has to do with our first baby. It is so easy to use that I can set it up with one hand and hold the baby. It is so comfortable for my little one. I read all the reviews before I decided to purchase this one and I am so glad that I did. It has a zipper that you can zip it up and carry it anywhere.
3,Great but know what you are getting,I love this but there are problems. THe blades broke on first use and I contacted Progressive and they replaced. I have used this many times and it has stood up to basic fresh potatos and vegetables. THe replacements for future are only $5...I plan to purchase a few replacement blades so that when I do have more problems I have the blade to handle it.
1,waste of money,"It does cut, and I do like construction, but even small potato will not fit in that slot (by length), I like my fries longer. It is a real waste of money.Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter"
1,Don't Buy,I received one of these for Christmas and it broke the first time I used it. I couldn't even cut through 1/2 of a potato before the handle bent.
1,Piece of junk,"This veggie cutter is a piece of junk, it is very small and everything you try to cut gets stuck in the blades, my wife got some mad she through the darn thing in the garge the very 1st time she used it. I don't recommend this product. Sorry, but it is what it is."
1,Broke on second try,I consider myself pretty strong. My hand still hurts from trying this on a fairly small yam. On the second yam the side broke. Not much else to say. If you want on set of fries before it breaks. Go for it.
4,French Fry Cutter,The cutter works as well as advertised. I have used it several times and am very sastified with it.
1,Keep Looking... Way to short.,I have had this cutter for a couple of years now. Every time I pull it out I hang my head in shame for not replacing it. The cutter is way to small and you will have to cut your potatoes to fit in it.
1,you get what you pay for,"The blades on this thing collapsed the first time I used it. When I examined the blades, they turned out to be a very thin metal that were joined with half notches, making them more fragile. Buy at your own risk."
3,it's good but not very cheap,it's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheapit's good but not very cheap
4,not good for sweet potatoes,"For a while I thought this thing was junk or just not sharp enough but it turns out it just wasn't able to handle the really hard raw sweet potatoes I was using. The sweet potatoes were also so much larger and longer that I had to cut them into 1/4ths just to get them to fit. It should be said though that even when putting an absurd amount of leverage into the device it didn't break or warp (although even then it wouldn't cut).I tried it again recently with an actual russet potato and it worked great! The only problem is you can't get absurdly long fries with this thing, we still had to cut the potato in half. But it went right through and saved me a lot of chopping time.Be careful also of the potatoes SHOOTING out after putting in the leverage necessary to cut them.The best thing about it is that by cutting all potatoes into same-size pieces they now all cook evenly!I can't say ""I couldn't live without it"" but on occasion it has been useful."
1,It's all French too me,"Can you imagine the thought ... your waiting for the delivery of the ultimate French fry cutter. You have purchased the sweet potatoes for a special French-fried treat. The long awaited cutter finally arrives!!! Anxiously you open the package, seeing your cutter for the first time a happy smile appears on your face. The grease is hot; you load 1/2 of the potato and depress the lever. The best looking home cut fries show up in front of you. With delight & glee you forge ahead with the second half of the potato ... but what's this? The potato does not go forth. How could this be? After all the cutter is brand new. I tried to continue but alas, the cutter was done, retired at 1 potato. An interesting occurrence, the blades buckled on this cutter. I read the poor ratings for this product AFTER this occurred ... next time I'll read the reviews Good & Bad BEFORE ordering. By the way returning the product through Amazon.com has been easy so far."
2,not goid for potatoes,"Cant put in large potatoes which is why i bought it. You have to slice them up in small sections. That messes up the cutting of the french fries. It will work but you'll beat your hand up trying to bang tbe lever down. Id spend extra money and get a more heavy duty one unless you just want to slice smaller easier things, in that case you may be fine with this one"
1,good for a soft or cooked vegetables only,Very weak design. Works only if you cut potato on small pieces or for a soft or cooked vegetables only. Cheap price and cheap quality. Would not recomment to buy.
3,"Functional, but need strength","This cutter works and has two great sizes for large and small french fries. It is not for people who lack upper body strength and it is critical to line up the vegetable so that is cuts straight and does not go in at an angle. I'm a pretty big guy and it takes some effort to push through a potato through the small cutting windows.Large potato's don't fit and will need to be trimmed, but the results are decent sized fries that you would see in a restaurant."
2,Too small.,"Its ok. Easy to clean and change parts. But too small, especially russet potatoes. I would buy a bigger one next time."
2,Flimsy blades,"The shoestring-sized blades broke after cutting about 5 potatoes. I started microwaving the potatoes for 2-3 minutes to soften them a bit, which seemed to help, but the 2nd blade set (steak-cut fries) broke after 15-20 potatoes. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Be warned,"Too small to cut anything other than a dwarf potato and too flimsy. The push plate bent and the pins just about popped out of the slots. I knew better but I thought I would save a few bucks. Buy the cast iron one just like your grammy and it will last forever. Better yet call your grammy, you've been meaning to I know, and ask if she's ready to pass her's on."
4,"I like it, wish it was a tad bit larger",In the pic it looks like it is very large but it is not. I had purchased some small potatoes and I still need to cut the ends off of the potatoes for them to fit. However this makes me want to eat more homemade french fries now since I used to take about 15 minutes cutting up potatoes with a knife and now I just push down on the lever and it makes perfectly cut fries. They even cook more evenly too methinks. For the price I recommend it.*edit*Yeah after using it a few times it is great but I would recommend that you spend an extra $10 and get the larger one since I have to cut down a lot of potatoes to make it fit. When the potato is too large it can get stuck in the blades which can be hard to remove.
2,not so great,Maybe its me... But this did not live up to my expectations. It couldnt cut potatoes or onions as neatly as I would have liked
2,Difficulty in using!!,Too difficult to use and you better have very small potatoes to start with!! It takes a lot of strength to cut fresh potatoes!
2,Disappointing,"The handle does not provide enough leverage to push the potato forward through to slice. You must apply a greater amount of muscle than my wife currently possesses. I decided to lend a hand and found that it was very difficult. We used it once but I am concerned its frame will not hold up to the pressures required to force a raw potato through the cutting matrix. I suppose I got what I paid for but it is disappointing. Our ploy is to cut the potatoes into quarters so there will be less resistance but that defeats the purpose of this device, which is to reduce the labor, required to cut french fries."
3,disappointed,"I have had one of these before; however, this one is not as sturdy as I would have liked. Should not have ordered."
5,Love this kitchen gadget.,I have had my French fry cutter for several years now & I use it every time I make fries. I just bought another one from amazon as a gif for my mother-in-law who has a large family. She is going to love hers as much as I love mine. It's easy to use & to clean. No complaints at all.
2,eh,"the product itself is DECENT.there are potatoe pieces that are left in the cutting grate, i can see how older folks could have trouble using it.it feels cheap... i dunno. just not for me.BUTTT unlike others i didnt say 2 stars because of my own laziness.. but i was thinking ""and.. i paid $$ for this when i can just use my knife to cut the things?"" the time it takes to get it out, use it, clean it and return in i could easily cut them myself."
2,Beware warping blades,"We received a french fry cutter for Christmas, and it self-destructed the first time we tried to use it. The large insert blades warped and fell out after the first potato, redending the device useless. In concept, the gadget is great, but it needs to last more than not-quite-one-time. I've contacted Progressive's Customer Service, and we'll see how responsive they are."
3,French fry cutter? Really?,I think this is perfect for cutting vegetables as there are two cutting sizes included. But I mainly bought this for cutting potatoes for home made French fries. You need small potatoes or they aren't going to fit in the cutter.
4,Jumbo is better,"I bought this product a while ago, and it is fine, except you have to cut up the potato, etc.I just received today, a Progressive JUMBO Potato Cutter that I saw in a catalog. Progressive now makes a cutter that is larger, and can cut the whole potato. Perfect."
5,You will love it!,"One of the best little gadgets I have ever used, and use it I do! I am still finding new uses for it. Some examples: apples-for pies,frying,fruit salads, onions,etc. The thing to remember is to make sure that whatever you put in to slice, needs to fit. If for example the potato is larger than the square blade grid it will be very difficult to push it through. So take a bit off the top when the veggie is too large. (I had to learn this through trial, error and aggravation.)I wanted to write this to hopefully save someone else from the same."
1,Do not waste your money.,"This product would not cut through a sweet potato. It barely went through a piece of a regular potato. While cutting through a potato it was bending and felt like it would break. It's fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for. I ended up using a knife instead. It's your $8.99..."
4,Two hands for one hand cutter,"In my quest to cut potatoes into french fries without removing any of my fingers, I picked up this international and progressive French fry cutter. Now I am not sure what makes this cutter international or progressive, but it does cut. The size of the unit is somewhat smaller than I would have preferred which results in somewhat smaller fries. However, the cutter performs the task fairly well. Although the grip is made for one hand, be prepared to have your other hand close to give it a err...hand. Quite a bit of force is required to complete the cutting task. Not so much that you need heavy machinery, but enough that I was surprised.For an intermittent tool in your kitchen arsenal that costs under $10, I say this cutter is a good buy. Happy cutting!"
4,A little extra work but a good time saver.,I had mine for 2 years before i broke it. I just wore it out.You do have to cut them to size and very large potatos can take a lot of force. Not for tiny people with no upper body strength at all.WARNING! especially vigorous cutting can shoot taters all over the kitchen if you are not careful! put a bag or something over the end so you don't shoot spuds around.
4,"fast,fun, and works on more then just potatoes",This is a very fun tool. It has a suction cup that really holds on. All parts are washable. it will cut just about anything that will fit in it. it's worth the price. it's not just for fries.
5,if you love fries- than you should not be without this!,"absolutely a must have for all lazy cooks who love french fries...easiest to use and clean, a favorite for all that love french fries....and very affordable"
5,Time Saver,I was really impressed with how easy this french fry cutter was to use. All of the pieces were cleanly and uniformily cut. Sure a time saver over cutting by hand. Was easy to wash & clean.
3,ok for a while,"I bought one of these from a local store several years ago. We had to use fresh (crisp not rubbery) potatoes. This machine could only handle the smaller diameter potatoes. I had to put a rug non-slip ""fabric"" under or it would slide all over the counter with the force I had to apply.Keeping all that in mind.... it worked great for about a year (we make french fries several times a month). The blades were very sharp in the beginning. After about a year plastic pieces started breaking. We ""babied"" it for another year with nuts and bolts from our garage. It's not a bad little fry cutter... If you only make fries a few times a year this is great. We make fries several times a month so I'm on the hunt for a professional one made out of all metal."
4,Good enough,"This a well constructed product and performs well with a little effort. It is a little short so you may have to cut long potatoes in half. The handle is also short, so you have to push pretty hard to force the potato thru the cutters. Worth the money, but if you are doing a lot of FF i would suggest a larger one. Larger ones cost 4x more, your choice."
4,vegetable slicer,This product is okay. It is not very heavy duty. It slices Yukon gold potatoes with lots of effort. I'm sure that it wouldn't be able to slice a harder potato and I'm not going to try because it feels as if it may break with to Yukons. But for the price I'm satisfied.
3,good product just a little flimsy,They say you get what you pay for and this product is ok for it's price..does the job but you have to be careful because it's a little flimsy.
1,That thing is driving me nuts,"I bought that cutter with the idea that I don't want to spend a lot of money on something like this.I just went with the cheapest option this time.Well,I got what I paid for.Cheap,thin plastic.Unsteady,wobbly feel.Can't cut medium to large potatoes.Only the small ones.The bigger ones you need to cut in half.Also there are a couple of places that trap small parts of the potato and its hard to clean it.Every time I use it I have the feeling that I will hurt myself.I would've return it but I didn't want to go through all that trouble for something so cheap.My advise is to buy a metal one."
3,Good,"Good, but you need to have arm muscles to use it, and a very firm surface, needs to be more heavy on the base or have some king of attachements to hold to the surface."
4,"This slicer can make it happen, much easier than cutting by knife","This is a great little slicer. The box is not huge, so you cannot make huge fries, but that's okay. Sweet potatoes are little tough to get through it, but if you cut it up into smaller pieces, 1/4's, its not bad. What's really great is how easy the blades come out to clean it. Overall I am very happy with this slicer. Does what it says and does it pretty good."
1,A Complete Design Failure,"Perhaps for the price perhaps the rig isn't all bad, but in terms of function, it is.Firstly, while the unit appears to have a long bed, the actual stroke is all of four inches, meaning you have to cut a typical potato in half, and are stuck with midget fries. The unit does not come with a shoestring cutter. The unit feels unstable, giving the user the sensation that if any of the substantial force required to slice is not precisely applied, the unit will kick out from under them and fly across the room.My advice: spend a little more money and get something that works."
5,Good Cutter,"This makes my life a whole lot easier, large spuds will need to be trimmed down, but overall this cutter is good!"
3,Okay for Small Vegies,"I was a little surprised to find that I cannot fit a regular full length potato into this cutter, so it's good for making smaller fries only. The quality seems fine and I like the optional blades for making string fries. I just wish it would fit a regular sized potato."
2,mini fries,"I bought this item with a new deep fryer and was excited to try this cutter. The first potato would not go through the cutter. Not enough leverage torque to push potato through. By cutting potato in half, I could get it through the cutter blades. So if you like 2.5"" french fries, this cutter is for you. I like long fries and will be looking for a different cutter. Not worth the effort to send back so will put in my spring tag sale!"
5,Easy,Simple to use and clean. It has 2 different size blades and cartridges that push the items through the blades. You can change them easily. Clean-up is fast. Making fries is a cinch now.
4,Super gadget!,"I have used this product more than any other that I have purchased off Amazon. My family loves homemade fries. We have had it a couple years now. Even with consistent use, it has held up pretty well. One of the little tab thingys that holds the blades in place has popped off, but doesn't affect usage at all. I clean it in the dishwasher and it usually comes out spotless. The only downside is that you must either get bags of potatoes with smaller potatoes or cut the ends off (this usually makes it easier to slice anyhow). It doesn't accomodate wider diameter potatoes. I plan to order the deluxe model in the near future."
2,Potato cutter,This is a bit flimsy. I fear that when I am trying to cut potatoes it will break. You have to put a lot of pressure to get the potato to cut through the blades and I am not sure this machine will stand up to much cutting.
4,HEALTHY MEALS,I've been trying to improve my kids diet - this easily cut potatos into fry size which I oven baked and the kids gobbled up. Unforunately I also wanted to make sweet potato fries - but there was no way this tool could cut through them.
3,It's OK for the money,"it's ""ok"" for the money. other french fry cutters are quite expensive and for the money, I would say its good. its nothing spectacular, but it does the job with a little bit of muscle work. if you have weak arm strength, or have upper back issues - forget it - dont get it. because when you push down for it to push the potato in and cut it you need to do it with some force. i myself had low back surgery and the amount of force you need to push it through is a little much for me. if you are going to cut vegetables and potatoes alot, especially everyday - i do not suggest this product- spend on the expensive ones. if its for once in a while - this should work."
2,Too Small,"Item is Built fairly well for the price.But my main problem is its too small,you have to cut the potato's down really small for it to work. To give you an Idea a regular size Red Potato willnot fit in it without trimming.Another problem, if your like me you like your fries with the skin on, with this utensil that will no work. Youhave to skin the potato first, as the skin will prevent it from being cut into fries.Will all the trouble I have had with this. It much faster to cut your fries with a good oldChef knife instead."
4,Pretty good,"I just got it today, and we have already made some french fries with it. It works pretty good. It does manage to shoot some french fries on the counter. The potatoes you put inside it need to be smaller potatoes because I first tried a big potato and ended up having to cut in half to fit. If you are using baking potatoes, it is a good idea to maybe even quarter it before you put it in. Clean up was a breeze since I have a sprayer on my sink. I would give clean up a 5 and ease of use a 4. It was definitely worth the money I paid for it."
2,not so sharp french fry slicer,"i have been looking for a product like this for some time.but what I got sure was not what i was hoping for.you have to use very small potatoes to make fries but that isnt so bad what is bad is we use sweet potatoes to make fries with and it will not cut them, it will not cut carrots the only thing it will really cut well is zucchini this thing was a big disapointment but i do use a lot of zucchini so it has it place in the kitchen."
3,"good, but small","Works well, but only takes small potatoes or have to cut up larger ones. Wish it were bigger."
2,does not work,"It looks like it would work, it is easy to assemble and clean but it just does not do the job the majority of the time. I could only fit very small potatoes in it to begin with and even then it takes some man power to push it through. By the time I cut my zucchini down to size to fit in I might as well finish cutting it myself.Well it was inexpensive...for the most part you get what you pay for."
3,Great concept...with limitations,"For what it is, this gadget is great. It slices two sizes of potatoes. Push hard and you'll get great, uniform fries.It also has limitations. Baking potatoes generally are bigger than this device allows. If you can live with trimming here and there, it sure beats slicing your fingers as you slice potatoes.The only other drawback: it only does potatoes. I'm usually not into one-function appliances. I tried dicing apples with it. Don't bother. Might work with jicama."
1,Broke on the first use.,"Don't waste your money. As others have stated you can't fit a whole potato in this device. That's not a big deal... However, I cut a standard potato in half and the device broke trying to cut it. The device never worked worked for me."
4,"Very handy, affordable kitchen gadget","This has become a very used kitchen gadget in our home. The blades are very easy to change and wash. I like the fact that I don't have to peel potatoes before cutting and frying them. The price is very affordable considering the quality of the product. The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because Progressive International"" has another version of the cutter that is a little bit larger and larger potatoes can fit in it without being cut down."
2,"It's not ""all that and a bag of chips""","Why are there so many positive reviews, I don't understand? I have one and I am not impressed. You have to be an iron man to push through a medium sized potato (just smaller than a fist). Large potatoes don't fit. And it doesn't do well with skin-on. I found that it only worked well with smaller potatoes or with medium sized ones cut in half before inserting. I don't know about you, but I prefer big fries, not the little stubs you find at the bottom of your fast food box, and this cutter will not accommodate.Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter"
1,Broke first time I used it.,Received this item and used it the same day it arrived. Broke first time I used it and had to throw it away because it could not be fixed. Waste of money!
1,Check the size!!!!!!!!!!!,"Its way too small for french frys, unless you like 3 inch ones. Should change the name to small potato cutter."
1,piece of junk,Broke after first use. Don't waste your money. Anyone giving this product more than 1 star is a relative of the seller.
4,Really like it- make sure to slam it down,"We've had ours now for a couple of months and we love it. I think the price is right for the quality. The first time we used the smaller fry blade and I couldn't quite get them sliced so I had my husband do it. We soon discovered that it needs to be one quick slam down and the potatoes glide right through. I can do it myself now. Also, the large fry blade is easier to cut with.After several weeks, I discovered some old potato gunk in slots on either side of the lever. Little chunks of potatoes get stuck and do not rinse out so I have to scrape out the holes with a knife. This is minor. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could."
5,good fries,The cutter works great - the smaller size is better. Makes great french fries and comes apart nicely so can clean it - great product.
2,Way too small and cheep,"I got this unit to make french fries ... it will only cut potatoes 4"" or smaller ... so most potatoes have to be cut 1 or 2"" shorter ... and the fries are too small. In expensive plastic unit with the handle and cutters are the only metal on it ... pass this up and use a knife ... RT"
2,Good idea-Poor design,"The cutter is a good idea in theory and ""should"" work well. Mine failed on it's third potatoe. The large fry cutter screen bent and fell apart leaving me with only the small cutter. I did not overload it or put to large of a potatoe in it. Now I cut potatoes using the small cutter no longer than 1 1/2 inches and no larger than about 40% of the screen cutter area.Seems to work well that way."
3,Small fries,"This cuts the french fries nicely, but you have to cut the large potatoes in half first because it limits the size of potato you can use. Longest you could have a fry is ~4 inches. Cleans nicely."
1,Cheap,The blade bent on the very first use! Very poorly made. I was only able to cut 2 potatoes. Don't waste your money.
4,Great for French Fries,"I bought this on a whim and I totally loved it.It easily cuts potatoes and it easily sets up and breaks down for cleaning. I am not very strong in the arms and yet I find I am able to cut the 'taters' with this very easily. My mother in law, who is in her 70's is still able to use hers to cut potatos.As with other reviewers I would say that this cutter could be bigger. If you have large potato you will have to cut it into smaller sizes in order to fit into this cutter. That is the only con that I can share with you.If you make french fries or sweet potato fries, this is the tool to use. We do parboil our sweet potatos before cutting them.This is one item I would buy again if we were to lose this one.Enjoy."
5,French Fry Cutter,"I have used this French fry cutter a lot since I bought it,Without a doubt the best value for the money. It makes perfect fries. I looked for years to buy one of these but didn't think they would be as good as this one is. I would recommend this cutter to anyone looking for great homemade Fries."
5,GREAT cutter...love it,"Not sure why people want to complain about being to small...read the description and do your research before buying! Progressive makes a JUMBO model if that's your need. We have utilized out cutter several times and it works flawlessly and with ease in our opinion. Cleanup in the dishwasher has never been an issue. Softer veggies can be an issue, but not the cutters fault. We give this a complete thumbs up!"
1,doesn't work well.. pretty crappy,"i thought that this would be great for cutting up fries for my deep fryer..its not very big.. only small veggies can fit into it.. small potatoes..its not very sturdy, and made of pretty cheap plastic.. haven't broke ityet but probably will soon. i missed my timefor returning it, but i would if i could."
4,Great for everything but sweet potatoes.,"Maybe I don't have enough upper body strength or confidence to cut sweet potatoes with this device. I just can't do it. However, any kind of white potato cuts easily though you may need to cut them down to size a bit to make them fit in the cutting chamber. I use it with myT-fal FZ700251 ActiFry Low-Fat Healthy Dishwasher Safe Multi-Cooker, Blackto make healthy french fry alternatives. Carrots, squash and other firm veggies cut very nicely too."
1,Too Expensive on Amazon!,Found this item at a restaurant purchase place for a lot cheaper. Felt kind like we overpaid. Which I would have done my research better. Works ok. Still hand chopped is better I think. Don't waste your money.
2,Too small and flimsy,"Just about every russet potato I've tried to cut on this thing has been too big. I've had to cut the potato lengthwise or through its width (and sometimes both) in order to make it fit. This is ridiculous. This is a french fry cutter, and russet potatoes are the de facto king of french frying spuds. Simply put, this is a poorly conceived product to begin with.Furthermore, the build quality is cheap and flimsy. This will be fine for someone who makes french fries once a month, but for anyone else, it's going to end up in the garbage soon. Too bad, cause the little 4"" fries it does manage to put out are quite perfect aesthetically (other than the length). I will be looking into one of the commercial quality cutters not sold on Amazon."
2,Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter,"This cuts really well, but it is really small. I have seen a bigger version of the same product, and I thought that is what I was getting."
5,Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter,The vegetable/french fry cutter works great and is easy to clean. I should have purchased this item a long time ago. The fries are so much more delicious prepared at home.
2,Be careful when using,"While this fry cutter definitely works, it is VERY VERY hard to operate since the sliding mechanism/torque is not long enough to make the cutting action easy to do. My husband and I had to try several different methods (including using both arms and my chin to bear down on the handle) before we could cut potatoes with any frequency. Even then, I'm scared to use it b/c it takes so much power to cut! I'd stick to knife-cutting if you can."
5,Value for the money!,Its now been in use for more than a month and still cutting the taters the way I like em. What more can I say.
3,Its Just Okay.....,"this french fry cutter works for the most part, but sometimes it jams or it is really hard to get the potato to go through.i tried butting other vegetables and they work mostly fine, but potatoes sometimes have trouble going through. It is however cheap and easy to use. there are no buttons or hard functions about this machine. so i give it 3 stars for easy to use and just wish it would be easier to cut bigger potatoes. ***"
5,french fry cutter,"Good product, excellent at cutting french frys as long as potatoes are not to big. Very easy to clean and store."
3,French fry cutter,This is a neat gadget that really works. The blades are sharp and the mechanical handle is easy to operate. One more neat thing is the suction cups on the bottom that keeps the cutter fast to the counter or tabletop.
5,IPAQ is the BEST PDA!!!,"I have one of the older IPAQ's and have loved it from the moment I first turned it on. Unfortunately it doesn't have wireless capabilities; but definitely has the best and most vivid display screen on the market. The speed and ease of use is fantastic. There are almost unlimited software titles, most of which are either freeware or shareware and the download and installation is a snap. Since IPAQ's use Windows CE; it is compatible and easy to transfer and use any MS Office files. Downloading and uploading of data through the infrared port is also a snap. I was able to upload about 100 contacts from my IPAQ directly into my new cellphone through the infrared port in a matter of seconds. If I had had to manually input all of them into the phone it would have taken hours."
2,WARNING,Had to return this item 4 times due to screen misalignment issues. It would stay in a loop at the align screen option. I am on my fifth 5555 and it finally works without a hitch!
1,HP IPAQ 5555 Lacks Service and Support,"HP engineers developed an acceptable product in the IPAQ 5500 series handheld computers. It has many features and capability for many add on features. This is all overshadowed by the lack of customer support. The devices also have a serious reliability ans survivability problem. One drop and your system is out of alignment and you quickly find yourself bogged down in HPs customer support system. They seem to have contracted out customer support to a company in another country and the folks you talk to have no expertice or interest in customer service. If you pursue the issue up the corporate complaint system, it only gets worse. This could be a good product, but with a serious lack of customer support and a very fragile product, you would do well to look elsewhere. If I ever get mine back from IPAQ repair, it will go up for sale and I will look at the new Toshiba handhelds."
2,"Great features, HORRIBLE reliability","I am currently waiting for my second ipaq to be repaired, I just sent it in to HP. THe first was DOA, this one died within 6 months of getting it. When it works, and dosent need to be reset it is a great product, but generally I have to reset the device at least once a day and I am curious how often I will have to replace the unit all together."
3,Sweet but high maintenance,"This thing is full of promise, the finger print recognition works great. The capacity and speed are breathtaking. Opps forgot to mention the 5 times daily soft reset, the battery life, the finicky software (not 3rd party either). $200 screen replacement if dropped.Then there is customer service. I'm not sure who is getting seviced during these manic episodes but it sure as heck isn't me. Most of these guys are not named Mike, Dave or Mary. They are definitely struggling with english as their third or fourth language. No offense to people who are multilingual but these people are not helpful, don't care and seemed to be ex Burger King workers. HP has a great product, too delicate but no support. I would save your money."
1,You can get a better paperweight for this price...,I bought this new and had to return it to the store after it started crashing... like my previous 3835 iPaq (purchase price ...) (would crash once every two times used) and Jornada (purchase price ...) (would crash all the time) both of which died almost exactly after one year of purchase. When I owned these I had to re-enter all my contacts and addresses more than I can remember....
4,Simply Amazing,"Calling it a PDA is a bit of an insult. The iPAQ 5555 is a hand held computer. With its Window format and very bright screen, it makes computing fun.Some complain it was too heavy - not when you consider the fact that it is extremely fast and does many feats that a desktop or laptop does.Set up is so quick that you are using the handheld almost immediately. It charges quite rapidly and found the WiFi in a matter of seconds.Gripes? I would have given the iPAQ five stars but not having a hard copy of the manual included (it is on the CD ROM and put on your PC) isn't fair. Also, getting it into the docking cradle is a bit of a struggle. However, the fingerprint recognition works great and it really is an amazing piece of equipment."
2,Poor Design - Great Ideas,"Well, you have to give credit to HP. If this product worked as advertised, it would be great. The problem that has plagued HP since the 3000 series started is the battery. It isn't replaceable by any part that you can get your hands on, and it has a shelf life of about 1.5 years. If that is the longest you intend to keep this product, then I strongly endorse this model. It is stellar, and several of the other reviewers have made great points. However, beware of out of warranty time. Our company made the mistake of buying several, and they started dropping like flies shortly after the 12th month. The model I have for my personal use died after 16 months, and I was told that it would be [money amount]for the repairs plus [money amount]for a year of extended warranty."
1,waste of time,"Total and complete data failure (and will not restore even after a full backup) 6 X in the last four months. This is after warranty replacement of the unit (based upon the old ""we don't know why it does that"") -Avoid this PPC until they make one that is suitable for everyday use."
4,Must have for Thanksgiving!!!,A bit large for its practicality on the dining room table. Great for that special occasion requiring gravy ....
3,Had this for years,"I've owned this gravy server (and its little brother - yes, it comes in 2 sizes, & if you received the smaller version, I'd contact Amazon or the seller) for at least 5 yrs, and the smaller version even longer. It has always done a good job of keeping liquids hot (you MUST fill it w/ VERY hot water for @ 2-5 minutes prior to filling w/ gravy or sauce), but I've always had problems getting it clean due to nooks & crannies where food can hide. Mine both came w/ instructions that said hand wash only. Don't know if the design has changed, or if they were just being cautious, but I think I'll try the dishwasher. If they get ruined, at least I know where to go to get a replacement!"
1,WRONG CAPACITY LISTED!,"Fair warning to anyone considering this purchase...the description notes that there is a 4 cup capacity....WRONG! I just received my order and checked - it holds only about 1 1/2 cups...I am VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DESCRIPTION!!! If I had the time I would return them, but I need something to serve sauce with for a Church dinner and have no time to get a replacement. I guess we'll be making multiple runs into the kitchen for refills!"
1,Smells awful. Cannot clean.,"DO NOT buy this item--you will return it, as I am doing. It has a very strong chemical odor about it, that did not dissipate after leaving it open to air for a week, and hand washing. It was so strong that it made the sauce inside taste off as well. (I have no idea whether it kept it hot--it was inedible!) It comes packed with a clear ring around the lid, which I think was the source of the odor, but even removing this did not solve the problem.Also--I hand washed and left to dry upside down overnight after use. When I tipped it back upright this morning, water leaked out from between the stainless steel liner and the body of the pitcher! I was apalled at thinking how much moisture/bacteria could linger and grow. NOT something you want in an item you are using for food.Cold sauces/gravies are better than hot, smelly ones! One star rating is one star too many. I am so glad I can return this--just awful product."
1,Skip it!,"This gravy server only holds a very small amount and the plastic threads on the lid don't line up correctly to screw the top on. It's a cheap, plastic mess."
2,Does not hold enough gravy,"After reading the rave reviews, I purchased the Oggi Servmaster Thermal thinking this will solve the problem of keeping gravies hot on the Thanksgiving table.It does the job, but the container only holds about 1 cup of gravy... not enough to pass around the table."
2,Skip It ...,This holds enough gravy for 2 people and then you would have to refill.I returned mine because it was poorly manufactured and had a hole in thebottom where water would collect when time came to wash it.
4,Very Good!,"I really enjoyed this book. The attraction between Reese and Derek, was HOT!!!. Although, Reese proved to Derek that she was a no nonsense kind of woman, in the end she ultimately had him wrapped around her little finger. This was definitely a good read."
2,Horrible!,"I hated this book. It took all I had to finish it. When I started out I thought, well maybe it's one of those that just takes a bit to get into....by the time I was half way thru I realized it was not going to get any better. The plot was so thin & it was in no way funny. I never actually got a feel of the characters - like they were real or had real feelings - I could not relate to them. Now the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the sex scenes were good & plentiful - infact that was the only thing that made the book interesting. And now that I think about it, it was like a porn: no storyline, plot sucks, fake characters, but lots of sex. I do not recommend this book....unless you wanna waste your time. Man, I wasted my money.....I wonder if I can get it back....."
3,3+ Pretty Good !!,"This was another worthwhile read from this author. The story was a little more in depth than her other books. As usual, interesting characters, lots of laughs and a whole lot of sex.The author has quite an imagination!"
3,First Time Reader,"This is the first book I have read by this author. While amusing at times, the plot is very thin. Read something by Rachel Gibson instead."
3,Smart Mouth,"This book was entertaining at some points, but I ended up disliking Reese. I found her an unreasonable bitch sometimes, and at other times, she was just a bitch. Knight on the other hand was too soft towards her at times, but definitely likeable. All in all, Erin McCarthy's Smart Mouth was an entertaining read."
2,Porn with witty dialogue,This book is basically porn with witty dialogue. I can't believe someone actually publishes this kind of stuff.
5,Hysterical -- DO NOT Pass!! (notice I signed this review),"Erin McCarthy's ""Smart Mouth"" is one of the funniest, hottest books I read in a long time. I loved Reese (Smart Mouth) and Derek!!There was nothing ""sophmoric"" about this book!!!!Keep up the good work -- your on my ""auto-buy"" list."
1,construction defeats purpose of a hammock,"hammocks, like waterbeds, are meant to give way where the body has protrusions(e.g.' shoulders, butt, elbows), molding to the body's shape, allowing for air to reach under the body in hot weather. making a sling of non aircirculating solid, unyielding fabric defeats these purposes."
5,Thomas and the special letter!,"Oh boy! Thomas and friends have returned in some all new stories! Skarloey returns home, George the Steamroller is introduced, and Oliver deals with a grouchy frieght Car known as S.C.Ruffy. I think that this should be for every Thomas fan!"
2,Looks Fake,"I have been looking at this ring for a few weeks and decided on buying because of its great reviews. However when I got the ring I was very disappointed. The diamonds on the sides looked glued on, it was not aligned correctly and stick out far enough to where it is uncomfortable, the craftmanship is poor and the diamond looks fake. I have to point out on the positive that the ring got to my home sooner than I expected but the box it came in looked rather ""dollar store-ish"". Company is fast and reliable, product is poor."
5,very happy,"SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE RING COULD HOLD UP TO ME WEARING IT WITH MY JOB CLEANING, MY HANDS BEING IN ALL KINDS OF CLEANING PRODUCTS AND AFTER 10 MONTHS THE RINGS STILL LOOK BEAUTIFUL. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY RINGS AND I WOULD DEFINITLY ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH."
3,se ve nice,"Cuando llego, lo detalle y esta bastante creible, si lo quieres usar a diario, da una buena imagen por que el tamaño se asemeja mas a lo real, el color y claridad, estan bastante bien, lo unico que puedo indicarte como un poco fastidioso, es que no permanecen juntos, tienden a moverse, el encaje no es perfecto, hay que estar jugando con ellos cuando lo tienes puestos, por lo demas pasan por reales, yo se los compre a mi cuñada en Cuba, y ella quedo fascinada."
4,very nice,"i bought this set because i've been on a 'bling thing'. this was a nice set & looked good. nice sparkle, it just didn't seem to fit together very well. the rings were always apart. my daughter loves it tho, she's wearing just the engagement ring & it's flashing!"
1,I HATE IT!!!!!!,"I hate this ring, I just recieved it a few days ago and I can't wait to return it, the cz is waay to big and fake looking, you can see the glue all around the smaller cz's and their aligned crooked......I HATE IT PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS RING EVEN IF IT IS ONLY 20 BUCKS!!!!!"
3,Ok i guess,"When I first got the ring, I was ecstatic. It was beautiful, looked absolutely real and made some of my coworkers jealous ;) but maybe two weeks of wearing it, one of the stones came out of the little ring (the one that just has the four little stones on it, not the big stone) and actually cut my finger! But it does look great for the price paid."
2,angie for tucson az,this ring is not so great one is a little bit bigger then the other they dont stay together dont even wear them would'nt order again disapointed
2,Looks cheap,"This ring set looks very nice in the picture. But, upon receiving it looks very cheap, and the two pieces do not stay together. Most of the reviews were good, so I thought it would be much better. Won't wear this one much."
4,great product!,it was perfect for my cube! i usually eat lunch at my desk and didn't want the food odor lingering. this was perfect. would definitely buy it again.
1,air sponge,Doesn't work for heavy cigarette smoke. We put it in a condo unit where the smoke is seeping up from a unit beneath into our unit and it is very smoke filled.
5,It works.,"No ""odor eliminator"", spray, candle, etc. is perfect. This one does the job in eliminating most odors. Make sure to pay attention to the suggestion for the square footage of effectiveness per tub of product. If product scent becomes too strong, close the lid while in the immediate area, then reopen product after you leave. Lasts longer than Wizard, Glade, Renuzit, and other popular air freshener products."
2,Removes Odors and Replaces Them with Something Almost as Bad,"I can't tell if the product actualy removes any odors, but it does an excellent job of masking every odor in the room with it's own very strong smell. If you're looking for something that removes odors without introducing another odor potentially more bothersome, I recommend you avoid this product."
4,Works pretty well,"I have some carpet in my hall that my chihuahua has relieved herself on. Same spot, several times. Can't get the smell totally out, there's a lingering funky smell. This stuff absorbed all the odor within a few hrs. Problem is, the smell comes back a little when you move the air sponge to another location. I guess I'll have to get an extra as it's good to have one near the cat box as well.It does work pretty well though. I'm happy not to have that funky smell in my hall anymore. So until I can tear out the carpet, this works."
3,Almost,"The athiests have used every rock and stick they could find to throw at Jesus and the Bible, and Robert Thorne does quite a bit of rock grabbing and stick throwing. Just as the previous atheists, Mr Thorne has made attempts to identify Christianity with all of the other worlds religion and to speak for those of us who have done scholarly research, I'd like to say we've had enough. But he does refer to Gordon Wasson and John Macro Allegro. And while Mr Allegro is guilty of using to many emotions instead of facts, he has succesfully brought the mystery of manna to the forefront. Although skeptic to the idea that Jesus was a mushroom, the idea of manna as a mushroom is not ridiculous! Mr Thorne makes the point that it has been proven that the word Kane Bosem from the old testament is indeed canabis sativa- marijuana. I think that with that in mind the connection between Israel and the Amanita should be considered."
1,What's the size?,"Ok, what's the point of offering a deck plate with no size offered? Bet they don't sell many! This is really ignorant. Deck plates need an overall size and a hole size described."
5,Incredible PC Speakers,"I should have known these would be awesome, given the Cambridge reputation. But I was even more surpised when I plugged them in. Very easy to set up to PC - just plug into headphone jack. I am going to get another pair for my bedroom TV- and one for an old boombox - where the electronics still work, but the speakers have died. Now if I can just keep my teenage son from playing them at full volume, I'll be in good shape!"
5,Recessed Lighting Hole Saws,Master-Grit Recessed Lighting Hole Saws Model Code: AA (part# 30863A life saver we needed a large hole saw for 6 inch recessed lighting fixtures. This worked great! would highly recommend.
5,The Traditionalists can stop complaining.,"The traditional stage types can now stop compaining, they have a opera that may suit their tastes. No more whinging about modern productions, which pushes them out of their comfort zone. I like both types of staging myself. This opera has 18th Century costumes and decor,along with the authentic instrument, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Naturally, this event takes place at Glyndebourne opera house, founded I believe by the Christies.The wife sang opera, Mozart was her favourite. The singers Miah Persson,Fiordilgi. Dorabella, Anke Vondung. Don Alfonso, Nicolas Rivenq, and the rest of the cast sing extremely well.Beautiful opera. Certainly, should be in your collection. But if you wish to see something completely different, I recommend, the New Valencia opera's, Les Troyens.The opera will put hairs on your chest."
5,One of the two best Cosi's on DVD,"You won't regret purchasing this DVD of Cosi Fan Tutte. It ranks with the very best Cosi on DVD, the Gardiner with Amanda Roocroft, Rosa Mannion, Rodney Gilfry, Rainer Trost, Eirian James from Deutsche Grammophon. I didn't think that one could be matched but this one does it. Indeed, the acting is even slightly better."
5,Wonderful recording...,"... probably the best opera blu-ray I own. Great cast, great production - and an orchestra to match. Ivan Fischer is an exciting Mozart conductor. From the first bars of the overture, you know you are in for a treat. The music is played with energy and enthusiasm. The two finales truly shake the house. Fischer and Hytner also have a few interesting things to say about the opera in the bonus interviews. The ending is ambiguous - as Hytner claims, every audience has to decide itself whether all's well or not by the end.Not much more to add. It's a treasure."
5,VERY GOOD IN ALL ASPECTS,"I am familiar with the excellent orchestra but none of the performers are known to me. As it turned out, all the performers are ideal for their roles. I don't have any comments for improvement. I liked the simple furnature that let's you concentrate on the actors and the singing. The picture is very clear and vivid, the sound is first class and the acting is usually good if not perfect (as is always in operas).To summarize, it doesn't get better than that"
3,interesting enough to watch.,"Look here, this is not an anthropological documentary. It's just a movie and as such requires some suspension of disbelief. If you can do that this is an entertaining flick. Acting is decent throughout. Not a super FX movie but it has enough of a story that is doesn't have to rely on visuals. I understand that sometimes music contrary to what the scene is about can make a dramatic point but it fails here. Too often the classical type score removes emotion that the scene is meant to portray. The soundtrack is a big downer in this one. It's not horrible but it does detract from the movie as a whole. It's still worth watching though."
2,I cannot believe people gave this a rating above 2 stars!!,"The Island...now what I was looking for was the Scarlett Johansenn movie but I ran across this instead. I have to admit that the description intrigued me and it had Michael Caine in it so I was game. Now, I will watch about anything and the story line was initially interesting but that is pretty much where it ends. What I can't believe is that I sat through the whole thing. I think I was waiting for the thing to get better but, alas, it did not. There were several branches of the inital plot where characters were not fully developed and did not follow why they did what they did or what happened to them in the end. Where they thinking sequel? I doubt it. However, the bad acting where several of the pirates had the stilted language and then would speak in fully ""Americanized"" slang just did not cut it. Bad editing or bad acting...probably a bit of both. I cannot believe Mr. Caine took this role. All I can say is just 2 Grrrs!"
1,"Bad movie, bad plot, bad acting","This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am sure the book by Benchley was good but something went wrong in the adaptation to film. Honestly, we never made it past the halfway point of this movie - it is that bad. Michael Caine has had some really good performances, but this is not one of them, in fact all the acting in this movie was so bad I think the actors couldn't even try to deliver the lines believable. If you want to see a good movie about the Carribean see ""The Deep"" or a good pirate movie see ""Cutthroat Island"" and be sure to skip this mixed up mess."
4,Great pirate film. When will this film get an R1 release?,"Great Michael Caine, David Warner film. Modern day pirates abduct Michael Caine and his disappointed son. The lead pirate (Warner) brain-washes Caines son -some great scenes here- while Caine is given to the woman of a man he killed upon their abduction. The pirates are living by by codes they'd originally enstated over 100 years ago. So, we have some very entertaining dialogue on this island. The US Coast Guard end up arriving for which the pirates have some daring plans. I won't give the storyline away, but when this film finally is released in the US there should be some rejoicing. Definitely one of Michael Caine's best films."
1,Dont support this paid idea,"Good movie, bad format. If you people would stop paying for this junk it would go away, these companies don't want you to own a movie, they are moving to formats like this so that you have to pay for each and everything. All these new ""formats"" are designed to keep you from ever owning a movie again."
1,NETFLIX SOON!!!!,STILL TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS THING!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAVE NOT WATCHED YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUT PAID SEVERAL TIMES!!!!!!!! DOWNLOADED 5 UNBOX PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!! HAVE ALL HARDWARE AND DSL CONNECTION!!!!!!!!!! NO HELP FROM AMAZON YET!!!!!! BEZOS!!!YOU LISTENING??????????????
4,Michael Caine Rides Again,"Yes, folks, its time for Michael Caine to do yet another movie. With the likes of him and Kevin Bacon around, where do other actors go to find work? India? True, India is a country of backward cow-worshipping wierdos, but hey, actors gotta make dough like anybody. By the way, unless they sit down at some neutral table, and I mean soon, Pakistan and India are probably one insult or border infringement away from nuking each other. Actually, that does kind of end up settling many of the world's problems."
1,WTF is this garbage?,"I'm not sure what this movie is SUPPOSED to be about, but I was promised modern-day pirates, not a bunch of backward savages playing chimps in the Caribbean. If I wanted apes, I'd watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. Michael Caine, I know you've been in some stinkers, but this takes the cake!If you want a Michael Caine action movie, watch Harry Brown and skip this nonsense."
2,about 40 minutes too long...,"couldn't remember the movie, but remembered the poster, so i rented to refresh my memory. it started out promising and ended good, but most of the island life was like a boring episode of 'survivor'. i would have edited this thing down to 90 minutes and it would have been cool."
3,The Carribbean from a different perspective,"I saw this movie for the first time on cable when I was a kid way back in the early 80's While it may not be one of the greatest movies ever made, it certainly is intriguing.If you're like me and like to jaunt down to the Carribbean once in a while, THE ISLAND will put a different perspective and a new spin on that part of the world. It creeped me out as a kid to see pirates who still lived as though they were in the 18th century wreak all that havoc, yet frankly, today I don't know whether to laugh or to be greatly disturbed by it all.With the recent success of PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN, I wouldn't be surprised if people seek out this movie for a comparison."
3,Great Gore !,I liked this movie...but I like Michael Caine. Parts of this bloody movie I had to close my eyes on but rewatch Island every so often for the adventure. One of the few scary creepy features that isn't done on a shoestring and Italian.Escapism but a good one. Too bad it isn't out on DVD
3,"The best ""Island"" movie around...","I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres. Not a great movie, not that bad either. An amusing movie at the time - considering the stuff that was coming out then - it ain't all that bad. Perhaps if I saw it again now I might see what those below hate about it - but I don't think so. This is one of the movies that I saw back in the late '70's and early '80s that stuck with me as a movie I really liked.So check it out - you'll be entertained at least - better than the ..... they show on television at any rate."
3,A Good Cinematic Version Of Peter Benchley's Novel,"Michael Caine stars as Blair Maynard, the New York magazine writer who searches for the answer to the unexplained disappearance of dozens of boats in the Eastern Caribbean. David Warner also stars as the leader of a band of pirates who have survived on a tiny island for centuries, still casting their mayhem and brutality on unwary sea travelers. Maynard is recruited by the pirates against his will to add his ""noble"" genes to their dwindling bloodline, while his son is recruited to join them"
4,Creepy movie with Michael Caine,"I remember this movie creeping me out as a kid and it still lives up to that creepy factor, shared the suspense with the family."
5,Excellent pen!,"I have two of these - one of them now about 6 years old - and can say with complete confidence that the Waterman Rollerball is an outstanding writing instrument. It has just the right diameter, weight and balance, making even long sessions comfortable. The cartridges are also very well made, with smooth, regular delivery of ink. I think this is easily as good as, or better than, a lot of pens that cost much more."
4,review,"Fantastic look into personal lives and struggles of ""regular"" dance students- I wish I understood Portuguese. I enjoyed the dancing and the ""look behind the scenes"""
3,Not as good as Goodnight Teddy!,"Lacks pockets where you can place bunny and not as fun as Goodnight Teddy. Good and recommend, but not great!"
3,Kinda Bummed...,"My son LOVES his Pat the Bunny book, so I bought this one for him so he could keep it in his crib with him. I'm bummed because they are only 2 pages that are truely interactive, and the story itself was sort of lacking... He doesn't even seem interested in it... I'm still hopeful that he'll get interested and I didn't waste my money..."
2,not much fun,"the best part about this book is the cover and the little bunny on the string. i agree with another reviewer that it's not as interactive as other books and the story is a bit uninteresting. the books from ""manhatten toy"" for instance, have lots of things to grab, made of lots of different materials/textures or make noises. this book only has two pockets and all the pages inside are just a basic thin cloth unlike the one on the cover which is made of a soft thin blanket material. only the 2 pages with the pockets are interactive other wise it's just printed cloth on the other pages with bland colors."
3,Cute but not really meant to be read,The book is cute and soft but the story is really lacking. I was planning to read this to my baby every night as part of our bed time routine but the story is so short and boring it has just become a snuggle toy for my 9 month old.
3,Tag is a choking hazard?,Let me first say that we love this book! My 7 month old has just started grabbing the bunny when we read it. She loves how the bunny feels and likes to turn the pages and chew on them. Her favorite part up until now has been the tag. Tonight when she was playing with it she ripped the tag off with her hand and put it into her mouth and she almost choked on it! My husband had to reach into her mouth and pull it out. I tried to call the publisher to report a book malfunction but there was no contact information on either the goldenbooks.com website or the randomhouse.com website. I wonder if our particular book is just defective?As always be sure to supervise your kids when they're playing with any toys and make sure not to put anything soft or chokable in their beds with them. This is a great toy for supervised play but I wouldn't let my child sleep with it.
5,a hoot,My daughter carries this around plenty and so I'm pleased. She loves to read books but is still at the stage where normal books tear in her fingers. So water and cloth and harder pages are where it's at! :)great shipping and quality btw :)
5,"Great book--shouldn't be listed as new, though!","I recently bought this book from Amazon, since I saw that it was published Nov. 2001. Great, I thought, a new book by Sister Carol Anne! Nope, it's an oldie (1986) with a new cover. So now I have 2 copies of the same book. Well, I'm rereading it and enjoying it again. Fortunately, at my age, my memory isn't as good as it used to be and the story seems fresh to me. Sister Carol Anne is a master storyteller and her mysteries are supreme. You can't go wrong with her books--even the second time around! :o)"
4,Miss Marple in a wimple.,"Sister Mary Helen is amazed to hear her quiet and very shy secretary belting out the blues in a San Francisco bar. The good sister is baffled but pleased to see her friend blossoming, even if under somewhat questionable circumstances. The next day, however, Sister finds the young woman brutally murdered. Since Sister Mary Helen is an avid fan of paperback mysteries, she decides she to see if she can unravel this one.You'll have the murderer figured out pretty quickly in this one, but it's light and amusing reading."
1,I don't like theses.,"Borderline nasty. I got the orange and it was disgusting. It had a waxy texture and tasted like a mixture of wax and orange peel. It was also hard to tear, stuck to the wrapper and came off a tiny bits. I don't know what to do with the othe 47 rolls. The Mariani fruit rolls are a much better alternate."
4,Must read,"Rather cumbersome reading but, right on track. Very insightful. A must for anyone interested in mentalism/hypnotism."
5,A book about Milton Erickson's Strategy,"Learn about Milton's Strategy of hypnosis and the expert modeling of Richard Bandler, founder of NLP and DHE. Learn directly the patterns of hypnosis used for creating change. A book chock full of metaphors and stories to weave change in personality."
5,Heard it was very intense and informative.,I purchased the book for a friend of mine who has started reading it. He said that it is very intense and very informative. It has helped him a great deal in understanding the topic.
4,"One of the very few ""MUST HAVE"" books about persuasion","Rated as an 8 ONLY because of its difficulty, this ranks as one of the few references that the serious student of hypnosis and persuasive language really MUST HAVE, and should read. The exhaustive list of presuppositions in language is, itself, a goldmine of information and study, and can reward diligent study and practice with exponential elevations in skill.If you want to know how Erickson did what he did, which even he admitted often escaped him, this book reveals the structure behind the master's skill.If you buy only a few books about hypnosis or persuasion, make this one of them"
3,Good though sometimes hard to follow,"The book is a nice summary of Hypnotic Techniques of Milton Erickson though sometimes it seems lost in its own words. There are several references to Bandler and Grindler's other books which makes it appear that for full understanding, one must read the other books as well. I do not regret my purchase of this book."
5,"Erickson Was A Genius, Period.","The guy that gave only 1 star to this book has no clue what he's talking about. Erickson was a genius and it was not in his content, but in the form he used.This book and the other part of it are an explanation and demonstration of Erickson's true skill - reshaping a person's thought patterns. Bandler and Grinder have modeled Erickson in this work and in other non published NLP related works, and this is where you see actual ""magic"" in Erickson's style of therapy.It's not the stories, it's not the miraculous improvement of his patients - it's the artful manipulation that Erickson was a master of.I highly recommend this book and anything else related to Erickson's life and work. By merely reading Erickson, you get better in communicating effectively with others.Enjoy!Shlomo Vaknin, editorNLPWeekly magazine & community"
3,its okey,"If you have don't know what is hypnosis and NLP, this book maybe good for you to go into these topic. Good to read anyway, but not worth to own one."
3,Worth a try,"If you are looking for a slasher horror type of book this is a pretty good choice. I like the fact that Stine always has you thinking the killer is someone and then it turns into someone completely different, usually its almost impossible to guess who it is. I read almost all of his Fear Street books when i was younger and i decided to get this from the library eariler this summer for a second read. I also like the fact that the emotions of the people in the acting camp are pretty real. Jealousy, competition, nerves and pressure - and thats without someone whose out to kill you!"
4,A good drama thriller.,"If you like mysteries, you'll like this one. I read it and was grossed out in some parts. Other than those parts, it was fine. I have read over 20 of R.L. Stine's thrillers and I would rate this one of his best. By the way, don't eat before 1 part. It's kinda strange.Good thing it's all acting!! If you remember that, I bet you will enjoy this book. MB Frost"
4,Darcus @ Starcrossed,"As with all R.L. Stine novels, I loved this book. It's an eerie thriller written for teens and young adults.This book was pretty violent. Everything from animal slaughter, suicides, stabbings, attempted drowning, gunshots, and even slashing of Rena's clothing. Swan lovers beware.This book kept you guessing for quite a while. It was hard to figure out the killer's identity and motive and it had that classic Stine twist of an ending.I enjoyed the characters and the setting of Curtains. Since it is set at an acting camp, it's hard for Rena and the reader to tell when characters were acting and when their actions, thoughts, and words were genuine.Must read for any R.L. Stine fan."
1,High Priced Mistake,"We bought this player for occasional travel purposes and were VERY disappointed when after 20 hours use we got an F893 Error Code and the unit was inoperable. As I said it was used for occasional travel, by 2 adults only, and unfortunately the 12 month warranty had expired by 1 month when this occurred. We were never offered an extended warranty (bought the unit from Electronics Expo on Amazon), but probably would have purchased if we had been offered one since we made a decision to buy what we thought was an upscale player at this price range. Now I have to drive over 100 miles to the nearest service center, pay a $35. service fee for them just to look at it and analyze what further costs I will incur to repair. Panasonic customer service basically was useless and would not even identify the nature of the error code for us. This will be the last Panasonic equipment of any type that we buy. It's back to Sony for me."
1,Dry rot in 4 months,after installing theseDare Prod. SNUG-SU-25 Chainlink And U-Post Insulatorthey started to fall apart and break... not just a few either the entire 3 bags of clips. they have good design and work well the first couple of months. DON'T waste your $...these are junk
4,Xena in the FBI,"This is another entry in the Xena style lesbian fiction. Tony (Xena) is a FBI agent with a dark past and Megan (Gabrielle) is an Assistant Coroner. They are brought together by a serial murder case that eventually has closer ties to Megan than they realize. In the process of solving the case, they save each other's lives and develop a relationship. This is actually two books in one. The second book concerns Tony being threatened when she uncovers corruption within the FBI. Both stories are well developed and hold your interest. There are a lot of the predictable comments about the ""tall, dark beautiful woman"" and her ""blonde gregarious lover"". The passion between them is alluded to and the reader is given the lead in scenes, but there is no explicit love scene in either book. Interesting stories, pleasant read."
4,Historical,"This small book gives the true account of a Union soldier captured by the Confederates, his escape behind enemy lines, his struggle to survive and after the war his return visit to the family who had given him shelter in their home after his escape from the Confederates. During the time the author was hiding from the Confederates the family, in whose home he was staying, had a son serving as a guard for the Confederate army at the Georgia Andersonville Prison. This book tells about the conditions of life during this time. My interest in the book is because it gives an account of my relatives. I found this book first in its original publication while doing genealogy research."
4,Powerful and Reliable,"I bought this IPAQ after doing much research. I wanted a Pocket PC, and knew that I needed to keep it very small. This IPAQ has met all of my expectations. I have used it for a year now, and plan to use it for at least another 18 mos. before I consider upgrading to newer technology.If I could do it again, I would at least look at pocket pc's that have built-in keyboards. When I originally compared these, I didn't think I would use that functionality much. After using it my stylus for a while now, I think I would prefer a keyboard option.I have had not problems with my IPAQ and it does everything it is supposed to do."
5,Used HP IPaq,I purchased this used IPaq 2215 to replace my old one. I am very pleased with it because t is practically new and in very good condition. Thanks.
5,Refurbished HP iPAQ 2215 Pocket PC,"Excellent product! I purchased mine for about $85, which is a small fraction compared to a new HP iPAQ 2215 Pocket PC retailing over $600. I've had no issues with it so far (1 month).It's fast, easy to operate, includes many useful programs, and I plan to keep it for a long time."
1,Buyer beware.,"Do not buy a used iPAQ Pocket PC or anyother Pocket PC. I bought one for my wife for Christmas(I will be paying for this for a long time). Received it before the 25th. We just got around to trying to down-load the software to my laptop. Well it seems that we need a 25 character pin code to do anything with the PC. It did not come with the code and HP wants to charge $50 to try and help to get the PC to Hot Sync with the laptop. Plus they don't even support it anymore. Right now I have a $179 useless piece of hardware. Again, DO NOT buy used or refurbished unless you can verify that all the information is there. PS: The seller will not take it back."
3,It's ok,"I believe had it not been for the lack of assistance I received from the seller (Not Amazon) of this PDA, I would have rated it a lot higher. Most of the applications and games work fine on the 2215, except for the fact, that it would not read either SD or CF cards from it's card slot on top. I did send my complaint, but never received any assistance as to what to do. One of the reasons for purchasing this particular model, was, so that I could view information or photos from the memory cards. Other than that it's not a bad PDA. I'll get a treo or a blackberry next time."
5,Best PPC available,"I used to have a Toshiba E335, but it just stopped working one day. I had the replacement plan from Best Buy so I just brought it back and they gave me credit for a new PDA. I decided on the HP ipaq 2215 because it is packed with features. It literally has everything you could ever want in a PDA. The best part is that Active Sync does not lose it's connection to the PC with it. My old Toshiba used to always lose it's connection, so I would have to restart it but not the ipaq. This is a great PDA that features both CF and SD and you can even buy an expansion pack for wireless networking. I never thought I would say this, but this HP computer is actually great. I'm very pleasantly surprised."
1,wireless sd card drains battery!! AVOID,"I just thught people should know- It claims to be expandable with sd cards-while true to an extent. I purchased an expensive sd network card; now i can surf. Only for about ten minutes, because sd cards drain the battery FAST!! Now I wish I had saved up for a Dell Axim which has the network built in. My point is you get what you pay for! I hope this helps you avoid a mistake I made- thought i could save a few bucks (what a dummy don't be fooled I give the 2215 a failing grade)"
1,HP 2215,"I have an old Ipaq 3630 which I use for navigation etc. I cannot find much else of a use for it. I am used to Psions which are real PDA's with lovely keyboards. So I succumbed and bought the new 2215. I returned it the next day. I tried a 256 MByte camera chip in it under picture viewer and it was so slow it was useless. The screen is poor with low contrast.The transcribe facility in notepad cannot keep cannot keep up with the pen, no better than my old 3630.These things are just pretty toys, cost almost as much as a laptop with the peripherals. I understand from reviews and forums Palm is better.I will try again one day, in a few years when my Psion battery needs changing ....."
1,Disaster,"I have this HP Ipaq 2215/2210 for 6 months and found the following major problems:1. Cannot wirelessly sync with my IBM T40 Notebook using bluetooth. The online manual is not helpful. The ""hold time"" when I called the HP technical helpline is about 20-30 minutes, and did not solve the problem. They suggested that I call Microsoft or IBM. I even went to the BlueTooth convention, the ""expert"" could not get the BlueTooth feature to work.2. Short battery life.3. I turned on the PDA after not using it for 10 days and found that it completely ran out of power (even though it had been in the ""off"" position) and lost all data on it.Advice: do not waste money on this product. It is high on advertisment but low on quality and performance."
4,"All good - Display lacks a little,",I like the features and the small footprint. Everything works great. The one small complaint is with the display... it seems to be less bright than say the 19xx or the 55xx models. I'm not sure if its a power issue since the 21xx series has only a 900 mAh Lithium-lon battery and they needed to take away from the display to conserve the battery.But overall a nice unit.
5,Xcellent praise and worship cd in spanish!,I love the music contained in this spanish cd! I recomend it to anyone wanting a cd to enjoy listening or praise dancing to for the Lord! Very anointed songs that take you up to the very throne of our creator!
2,It's a donkey or hinny not a lama,"It claims in one picture in this travel book that it is a lama standing close to a car. Actually it's either a hinny, donkey, or least likely a mule near the car."
4,Good book,Great book for giving the commands for a MIPS chip. And a great way to teach yourself to program in assembly~
1,Low quality,"This book is of the lowest quality. The paper used fades out the printing so badly that is it difficult to read in some places. Additionally, the material is covered in a disorganized way. The overall instruction set is not introduced at the beginning of the book in any sort of understandable manner. This is a VERY poorly written book and is most definitely not worth the price."
4,Great Study Aide,"I really love the CrunchTime series, it has saved my butt several times so far in law school. The Criminal Procedure book is one of the more helpful editions because of the nature of the topic; code and enumerated laws."
1,not current edition,"Be warned: this is not keyed to the current edition of this text book. Since many of the cases in the text book are very recent, this supplement is almost useless. wait for the next edition."
3,useful the night before your final,"It is a very thorough commercial outline. However, there are many details that are being left out. In brief, it is not a perfect substitute for actual textbooks."
5,this album rocks,this is an awesome album. i listen to their first cd a couple of days ago and that one rocked and then i got this one and it rocks too. just as good as the first.great christian music.
3,Not quite as good...,"Overall the album isn't quite as good as Glory Defined. The song Because You're Mine is easily the best on the cd and has the same harmonies as Space Between Us. Also I'm really liking the harder edge they picked up for Rise and Empty (the only two heavy songs on the cd). However, most of the songs seem a little too hectic, as if too many instruments and different vocals and beats are going on at the same time and therefore, it never quite comes together. Rise, Empty, Because You're Mine, and the lesser Searching For A Savior are pretty much the standouts. Also, they really killed Blessid Union of Souls' ""I Believe"". The point of a remake is to do it better...not worse. Not a bad album but I truly expected better."
4,An Example of Good Christian Rock!,"This CD is a prime example of how rock music can be used for God's glory! I like over half the tracks on this album and can honestly say that I plan to listen to this CD in the future. My favorite song is ""Fearless"" which encourages Christians to give their all for God and be fearless in spreading His message of love. Overall, a good CD full of awesome rock melodies that you can learn to love!"
2,poor songs,I didn't like the artists songs. gave the cd away. oh welllllllllll we'll wellll wel well well well we'll wel
3,Good for a few months,"I got this item in January. I was really pleased with the clarity in my area, only having to change the station occasionally. By the beginning of May, it started to play thru only one speaker. The wires had, apparently, come loose. If I jiggled it and set the Zune in a certain way, it would play fine. Now it doesn't play at all. I am really disappointed, but gave it a 3 for the fact that it worked well for 3 months!"
2,Wishing it was better..,"I get a lot of static with this connected to my Zune in the car.It was pretty cheap though, and it does work, just not as good as I would have hoped. I really need a new stereo that has an audio-in plug; this works through the radio, but does not sound nearly as good as a tuned in radio station. I got the Zune cranked up to 20, and my stereo louder than usual to get to my average volume. It sounds pretty lousy.If your really gripping to get tunes going in your car or boat, go for it. If your looking for high quality, keep looking. This is mediocre at best."
3,Does its job as well as one can expect,"The factory stereo that came with my car has no AUX input in front or beneath the dash, and I don't want to spend a lot of money, time or effort ghetto rigging it when I plan to buy a new car soon. Thus, I bought this. It has several frequencies to choose from, but could be improved by having a full-spectrum scanner. The resulting sound is tolerable, albeit bass-heavy and (obviously) not even CD-quality.For what it is, and because I had a gift certificate that made it free, it was a good buy. I only wish that I hadn't lowered my standards to buying it. Might not be worth the $20."
2,"Works somewhat, but I cannot recommend",I figured an FM transmitter like this located inside the vehicle would be able to transmit a strong signal to the antenna. Antenna is located in the back window of my 02 Accord. Perhaps there are products that can do the job well. Perhaps it's the fact I'm trying to play music from my cell phone (Motorola V3m) although the device sounds really quite good using earbud headphones... Perhaps its because radio stations in my area have some stong transmitters at the low end of the FM spectrum. Maybe my stock AM/FM/CD player in the Honda is a poor receiver. I don't find this product working that well for me. Price was reasonable. Easy to use. Operability in my application is poor.
2,doesn't provide a signal depending on the vehicle.,I've tried using this in 4 vehicles. It did not work at all in a rental car we had. It really depends on how close the radio antenna is to the transmitter. The sound you get from it is pretty disappointing when it does work. The highs tend to be very muted.
2,THE TIME HAS ENDED FOR THIS ARTIST,"HELLO EVERYONE. I HATE TO BE HARSH , BUT THIS COME BACK ALBUM DID NOT DO IT FOR TRACIE. I HAVE LOVED HER MUSIC FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT THIS ALBUM IS A FLOP. NOW SHE HAS SOME SONG'S THAT ARE GREAT , BUT MOST ARE AWFUL. IT WAS GREAT OF HER TO TRY THE COME BACK , BUT FAME IS NOT HER'S. SORRY TRACIE. I LOVE "" STILL IN MY HEART"". THAT IS IT."
5,Fantastic debut album,"This is a wonderfully written album. Dan is definitely an up and coming star with a smooth sound. The richness of his vocals compliments the acoustic sound that radiates from the tracks on Boise Bend. I was fortunate enough to catch him and his band playing in the Denver area and I have to say they put on quite a show. Don't pass this one up! It looks like the cd hasn't made it onto Amazon yet, but his website is [...]."
1,God Awful!,"I got a free copy of this.It's possibly the worst thing i've ever heard.The singer could seriously have the worst voice in all of history!hey guys, lay off the effects pedals and try to write a decent song.stay as far away from this as possible."
4,Nice sub!,Plenty of power and able to fine tune to the environment.It has given my HT a real kick in the pants :).
4,Just as i expected!,The used copy I received had only a few margin notes. Gleason's is the classic training manual for the organ with pedal study and manual technique and some easy repertoire. Highly recommended. Also recommended is the beginning book by Wayne Leupold.
1,~ Delusional demagoguery ~,"It is indeed unfortunate that a tree or two gave its very all for the delusional demagoguery presented in these pages.The author obviously harbors a grandiose vision of himself, which is as far removed from the primary subject of this book as earth is to the center of this particular galaxy in which we presently find ourselves.If you really wish to learn more about Jimi Hendrix, don't waste your hard earned frogskins on this one. My advise would be to begin with _""Electric Gypsy,""_ and then, perhaps, the _""Jimi Hendrix: Sessions""_ book.If it would have been possible, I would not have given this book any rating stars. Hopefully when it is ""remaindered,"" it may be rendered into the toilet paper which it truly already is."
4,the best of a dying breed..,"This TV is rich in color and amazing in sound. The volume alone can go up and be as good as any sound system. We play Rock Band II at concert level on this TV and it handles it quite smoothly.I purchased this wonderful Picture-in-Picture TV in 2005. With HiDef taking over, it is a very bitter sweet purchase for me. Oh well...it is the best of a dying breed.4 stars because although it is a great TV it weighs over 200lbs and is not HiDef."
2,spider robinson did it better,the author obviously liked robinson's callahan stories unfortunately he's not robinson. for that matter for bar stories I like arthur clarke's tales of the white hart more.
4,He is great!!,"Despise one of reviewers, this book is easier than ""your First YEar"" that I think is too long. Also, the affirmations part is VERY powerful.Mark Yarnell has been a very important part of my success, over 15 million in sales in my 3 years in my company.I don't give him 5 stars because he tends to be a hardliner in a couple of issues, but despise that, he is the man!George"
5,Lamy Pico Platinum,"This is a beautiful, useful artifact. Very comfortable in feel and writes amazingly well, I am never without it!tg"
2,A warning,Be aware that this expensive ebook does not have footnote hyper links enabled. A bit of a bummer for researchers.
4,The definative work on the 1700's PNW fur trade,Scofield digs deep into hard-to-find journals and letters from the voyages of the Amercian fur trading vessels Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington. His colorful descriptions of the meanderings of the two boats paints a vivid portrait of life aboard a trading ship along the mostly-uncharted coast. Most impressive here is Scofield's insight into the men who pressed on with arrogance and greed to find fortune in the Otter fur trade circle of the late 1700's.
4,Excellent history of early American trade and shipping,"Excellent history of a little-known and fascinating chapter in early American maritime and trade history on the Pacific coast. Kendrick's and Gray's expedition helped spark Jefferson's interest in the west; their exploits were precursors to Lewis and Clark. Lively and full of interesting anecdotes, particularly of Kendrick's activities."
2,"White, not Charcoal!","I actually have a set of these speakers and use them as rear surrounds and they sound really good, as all of my other Cambridge speakers do. The problem is that what I received was not charcoal but white. This was obviously a huge disappointment and set me back as far as setting up my 7.2 system. Some might say that it was false advertisement so what I suggest to the folks at Amazon is that you require full disclosure from anyone selling product."
2,There are better quality compilations available !!!,"I own most of the ""Oldies But Goodies"" CD's; but if I was doing my oldies collection project over again, I would have stuck to other compilations instead. I don't believe that this series was the best use of my money.The biggest problem is that the audio quality is usually noticeably poorer on the ""Oldies But Goodies"" versions of songs that also appear in other compilations. ""Oldies But Goodies"" would be my last resort as a source for an oldie song, not my first choice."
2,RENT IT DO NOT BUY IT. Or just don't buy it....,"It wasn't that good. In fact it was allot of talking not much showing video footage & commentating about it. It's rather boring. I didn't find it very interesting. I was expecting a good video commented story of how things are with Mercs. More of a story of a guy sitting in a chair talking about his life. Some of the other reviews says this video kinda goes know where. Yes I agree with that. I still haven't finished watching it. Save your money netflix, blockbuster video it. Or wait for it to come on TV or cable. Beter yet Bit-torrent it...I have seen better Documentries on the animal planet channel. Not to mention Military Channel or History Channel! I give it 2 stars, because I am being nice...In short: Sorry shadow company, you failed to keep my interest & attention. Story goes know where, not a good documentary..."
5,Unbiased reporting,"This is an outstanding DVD on the current trend of PMCs. Unlike Jeremy Scahill's very anti-PMC book ""Blackwater"" and Al Venter's very pro-PMC book ""War Dog"" (which were both great reading), this video showed the pros AND cons of modern mercenary organizations.I enjoyed the fact the producers provided information without displaying their own personal views (biases), much like Robert Young Pelton's book ""Licensed to Kill."" True professional journalism. I hope these guys cover more hot topics.Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror"
3,rawkin',"Do not expect this record to break any new ground. However, it does deliver raw, catchy punk rock n' roll; very much in the vien(no pun intended!) of Johnny Thunders. Lyrically, it's standard raucous subject matter. But hey, these guys are young and this is pretty much regarded as their debut record. Not a bad release at all, good cover of Travelin' Band. I'm curious to see how they follow up this LP.I heard they've been on hiatus for a while now....one member has another band called Poison Arrows."
1,made in china!!?,"i ordered this four pack of staedtler pencil sharpeners and am disappointed to find a made in china sticker on each one. i read that these were made in germany under the description and ordered after i couldn't find a pocket pencil sharpener made in usa. the quality hasn't been tested, but plan to return order."
5,great bubble maker,This really does make A LOT of bubbles! We were very impressed with this bubble maker. Used it a few times so far. It is easy to clean after use. so far we've only tried the gazillion bubble solution that came with it.
1,kukybkr,"I thought this was a great thing for my twins, but, even using gazillion bubble liquid, it stopped blowing bubbles after the 3rd use. I even tried new batteries! what a waste of money. I am not buying anything except bubble wands from now on."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wouldn't even give this toy a 1 start rating......we bought it for our kids for Easter and it hasn't blown one bubble for us....first the tubes were pinched off so we fixed it, no bubbles.....so we cleaned it per the instruction manual,STILL no bubbles!!! I have however poured bubbles over the feeder area and got lots of bubbles that way......but to use it the way its meant we haven't had any luck!!! What a disappointment!!!"
1,Do not buy,"I have purchased a total of 4 Gazillion bubble machines in the past four years (3 different models), and will NOT be purchasing another. Yes, the price is very reasonable, but you only get one week's of use (if you are lucky) out of the machine before it stops working and will not work again. Very poor quality, very disappointing.I am going to buy a different bubble machine from Party City this weekend and see how that works. Hopefully my kids will not be disappointed this time."
1,worthless,I have purchased two in the past two weeks. First one stopped working after one use. The bubble solution would seep into the battery compartment and rust. The second one did the exact same thing. Used 3 times total. Look for another machine.
4,Lots of bubbles! (But will this toy last?),"I bought this toy for my 3 year old niece's outdoor birthday party and the kids (and adults!) LOVED IT! It just filled the yard with bubbles, and in the sunlight looked beautiful (I think I want one LOL!)I warned her parents to carefully and thoroughly clean the bubble maker, lest it stop working. There was a stern warning from the manufacturer, as well as reviews on amazon.com that said you MUST DO THIS.They cleaned it and on the second use a few weeks later, it did make bubbles but no where near as much. I personally did not fill up the bubble reservoir (someone else did), so perhaps it just needed more fluid -- I just don't know.But it did work great, I just don't know if it's going to work time and time again.PS, if you buy it, don't forget to buy the 8 AA batteries."
1,Tried Two of Them...Wouldn't Work Either Time,"I bought this toy for Easter and I was SO disappointed that it DOES NOT WORK. I followed all directions and turned on the machine. The air was blowing, the wands were spinning, but no bubbles were coming. There is a tube that is supposed to bring the bubble solution up from the base to the wands, but there was no solution getting sucked into the tube. I took it back to the store and got another one, and the lady at the counter said that she had been getting them returned all day (lots of people having issues with the motor or solution tube). Even so, I exchanged it for a new one and just tried that one. Even bigger problems: not only does the tube not bring solution to the wands, but the motor on this one doesn't even work. I've used other Gazillion bubble machines in the past and liked them, but believe me, STAY AWAY from this product!"
1,Bad overdubs,"Avoid this like the plague. It contains some horrendous overdubs which seriously despoil the original, classic recordings.There are dozens of worthwhile JLL compilations of original Sun material on the market. This one is worthless."
4,Great For Couples,Got this devotional because it was written by a couple to get both perspective and it is great! Saw Tony in person and his book is all that I expected.
4,Forerunner 305,"This item is a fantastic aid to training. I am a triathlete and switching between training activities is a breeze.pros: Excellent battery life, super intuitive menus, plenty of data collection, great tracking of wokout historycons: A little big for smaller athletes, outdated mapping software (for the computer), NOT OK TO SWIM WITH! (this is rediculous for a unit in this price range, I fried one swimming so believe it when they say not to swim with it.)Because of the water issue, I can't give it a 5 out of 5. However, I have been using this unit for a year now and I believe it has helped me get stronger and train injury free. I don't go out without it!"
4,Garmin,"I had the 101 Garmin and like that this Garmin is charged electrically rather than by batteries. Still trying to figure it out, but know others that have the same Garmin so they are willing to help."
5,Garmin305,A very good product. I have been using the device to record our hikes and it has been flawless.
4,GPS watch,"I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and i really like it. It's very easy to start using it and also very intuitive.I mostly use the pace and the distance monitor and it helps me to keep up with my training goals. After every run I connect my Garmin to my computer and the new run is automatically transferred by the installed application coming with the Garmin. I can see on map where I ran, and I can also document all my trainings. I also use The 'Garmin Connect' web service to share my trainings with my team runners.Its very exciting and motivating.Cons: A little bit heavy, and the maps coming with web service is not always correctly displayed."
4,Better than expected,"I have never owned a GPS unit to use during our workouts, so I did not know what to expect. But, this a very nice little gadget. Because I have not delved into many of the features it has, I gave it four stars, but for length of skate/bike/run, pace and time, it is easy to read, far more accurate than I expected and has allowed us to prepare much better for our inline marathons. The price is where it gets really good. I talked to several people who paid much more for their GPS units and found they liked this one as much or better. I am quite sure several people I have loaned this unit, will be purchasing one very soon."
5,good for allround training,"used it a couple of times now and are very happy about it - it even worked as a good gps direction guide when my car GPS was not working in a trip to germany. would have wished that it was fully waterproof, bot to that price no complaints"
1,Horrible Battery!!,Battery stopped holding a charge shortly past the one year warranty. It has some wonderful features and is very helpful when working. Have talked with others with same problem with same and similar models. BATTERY SHOULD BE USER REPLACEABLE!!!
5,great Multifunction watch,"I have been using this model for past three weeks and this multi function watch does what it promises, GPS accuracy is precise and locks in pretty quick. some may complain about it bulky size, the circumference of my wrist is les than an average man and i can wear this very comfortably. I am very satisfied and happy with my purchase."
5,No Problems / Best Investment,I love this product the garmin forerunner 305 is great it has really helped me pick up my running. I have had no problems with it what so ever.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"The Forerunner is packed with info derived by the GPS. Your speed, elevation, incline, etc. Very pleased witht the item."
5,Awesome Product!!!,This thing is awesome! I was skeptical about buying it as I live in a heavily wooded area and connectivity with a satellite based GPS unit has been an issue in the past. Needless to say it's no longer an issue. The unit is very user friendly and programming / controls are very intuitive. I could go on and on about this unit.
5,#1 workout watch with heart rate monitor!!!!!!!!!!!,Best workout watch ever and every feature you ever wanted in a runner and heart rate monitor. Garmin rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Excellent for running,"I like it, it's easy to use but I have some issues that can be improve:1. The time for synch with satellites, it takes 2 minutes2. Some times the instant pace has bad readings. When I run at the same pace with one buddy who has the same monitor model, it has different readings at certain moments. It's like for 1 or 2 seconds was un-synch with satellites.3. I have problems with the software, I couldn't connect it with my PC. Some people recommend me Sports tracks. I install it and I could download my trainings.4. When I use it in interior or at the gym, the calories aren't calculated. I don't know why.In general it's a good monitor and I like it"
4,Great running accessory!,"This is a great piece to have if you are a runner. I've just started running but have found the 305 great for keeping up with pace, heart rate and distance. You can customize the display to your preferences. The heart rate monitor has always picked up and been accurate. The buttons are a little hard to push and the alert alarm isn't real loud...sometimes I miss my 1 minute rest during my run. I run 4 mins. then walk 1 min. and it's easy to set up if you are an interval runner either by distance or time. I would buy it again."
5,Sweet product,"This was my first attempt at ""electronic"" training. This unit was perfect for triathlon training and am currently on pace to lower my previous time by 32 minutes. Love the ability to graph progress and establish goals."
5,excellent,"I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. Three fully configurable screens (up to 4 paremeters each) give you full background on your workout. Once the GPS satellites are locked, they are really hard to lose. The device itself is very accurate, considering GPS position as well as heart rate monitor. Heart rate monitor doesn't interfere with other stuff like a mobile phone I have with me while running. Didn't go through all advanced options yet, but even the basic usage is more than what I've expected. Also even without the manual you just turn it on, and go - it's very simple and easy to use."
5,GARMIN FORERUNNER 305,I bought this Garmin Forerunner 305 to replace my old one. Prices have come down so much on this product since originally introduced that it was more advantegeous for me to buy a new one than to repair the old one. I knew exactly what I was getting so I am happy with my purchase.
4,Great Training Tool,"Lightweight, comfortable ,easy to use. Tracks pace, distance and elapsed time all in one triple display screen. I turn it on inside the house and it locates satellites in approx. 45 seconds and is ready to strap on for a run. I'll be able to continue training for a December marathon no matter where I go for vacation or for an out of town weekend. The only drawback I see is the heart rate (located in upper rt. corner) is too small to read while running. I have to stop, walk, and look very closely to see the small numbers. This function is available in larger print but not at the same time as pace, distance and E.T. A quad screen w/larger HR function would make this perfect for my use."
4,garmin 305,Everything is as per my expectations. The only limit I see is the accuracy and I will investigate in the next future how reliable is the gps. Very much appreciated the possibility to customize the fields on the page. The Visual Partner is a good help for long workouts.
5,Excellent product,"The Garmin Forerunner 305 is a fantastic product for runners, cyclist or any persons that like to know where he's at in his training. The heartbeat monitor is a bit finicky at rest but when doing the physical activity it works no problem. The type is a bit small on the display, apart from the time elapsed which is easy to see, but I mostly use the rest of the information in the provided software by downloading from the device. The graphic of speed, distance vs heartbeat help you see the progress you are making while training on a regular basis.ThanksJohn Brodeur"
4,Lots of information,"The Forerunner 305 works perfect for me while running orienteering competitions, it gives me my pace when I run and I can afterwards ceck the distance actually run and compare it with the length of the track. The Garmin Training Center had a Runtime Error when I istalled it on my computer and I hope that Garmin will reply on my question. My intentions is to upload my tracks to RunOway, something I have been told should be possible. GPS reception has been no problem not even in dense forrest. I can see a lot of applications and statistics when training for long distance running. The unit is a little bit clumpsy but since the weight is onlt 72 g it should not be any problem."
5,Great Product!,"This is an amazing watch! It acquires the satellite signal quickly. I am an avid runner, and the features are great to enhance my training. There are so many options on the watch that I have not yet explored. This has the best heart rate monitor I have used."
5,Superb product,"I'm gonna keep this simple - this watch is fantastic. The worst thing about this product is it takes up to 5 mins to find a satellite - no big deal you can just stretch before you run/walk/ride.I checked out all the feedback on here, realized that half of the negative comments are actually not problems with the actual watch, it's user problems/Garmin cust service. I love this watch, it works great in the Mountains - forests etc I am yet to have a problem with it. Extremely accurate,especially the distance! I also love the fact you can check out your activity on Google earth"
5,Garmin Forerunner 305 Review,"Not being familiar with the Forerunner series I purchased the 305 and couldn't be happier. It works well when you running in coverage, the distances seem to be accurate. The heart rate monitor is very a handy feature, not a necessity but a nice to have. I compared this to some of the timex models and believe that garmin has the edge. Enjoy your purchase."
4,Love my Garmin,Have had my Garmin Forerunner 305 for several years now and find it absolutely essential for my running. The configurable screens (with ability to configure Bike mode different than Run mode) allows the user to dial in that data most useful to them. My only complaint about the 305 is the boot time - seems to take a long time to find and identify satellite signal. But overall a great tool for a runner or cyclist.
5,Awesome training aid,This is an incredible tool for training with its intantaneous pace feedback or its ability to allow you to run courses and show how the current session compares to the previous. It also easily syncs with its computer training software to give you details about a particular session.
4,Good for cycling and running!,"I love this watch. I use it for running and cycling (I bought the cadence sensor). My only complaint would be that its only water resistant, not waterproof because I'd like to get into swimming, but will need to get the 310 or 910 if I want to do that. I used it for the Pelotonia (180 mile ride over two days), and the battery lasted for the whole thing! I was impressed!"
3,I expected a lot more from the new Garmin 305,"Let me start telling you that the size is excellent and confortable. The screen is just the right size and the display options are as flexible as can be. It works nicely. What I can't understand is the software that comes with it. It is horrible, very primitive and not flexible at all. It seems like the hardware folks from Garmin did a great job and the software people never showed up. Another anoying thing is the time it take to locate the satelite. I turn the Garmin on and leave it outside while I change and get ready. It can take up to 5 minutes! It is a great watch but I expected a lot more ! Hope Garmin works on the software soon ."
5,"Like a timex, takes a lickin and keeps on ticken","I use this thing for everything, mountainbikeing , hiking, even took it on a enduro motorcycle ride. I have hit the ground with it numorous times. I love my Garmin"
4,Helps Me Gauge My Workouts,"Oveall its a great product. The main reason I chose this product was for the advanced workouts. The software it comes with allows you to create workouts based on speed, heartrate, etc. for specific time, distance, etc. There are several options I haven't explored yet. Previously I estimated my running distances, but the GPS lets me know exactly how far I've gone. You can also customize what information is displayed on various screens.The only things that would make it more usable to me would be quick buttons to turn the GPS on and off (for when working out indoors) and to turn the alert sounds on and off. These can be done from the menus, but you have to navigate through several menu levels to get to them. It would also be nice to be able to adjust the volume of the alert sounds. I often don't need them to be as loud as they are, but my only choice is to turn them off."
4,Great product,"Overall the hype about the Garmin 305 is pretty well deserved. Its a great tool for an athlete and an even better tool for a Triathlete. You can use the GPS feature to get reasonably accurate distance numbers, and elevation. It also has a ton of programmable features like alarms, workouts etc you can use. I have had mine for a month and have not yet figured out everything. In addition, you can go indoors and use the accessories they have for the Bike and the run ( Foot pod, bike pod). All is well made. The only downside is that its not the most user friendly device I have seen. Not very intuitive. For this HR monitor they are not kidding when they say ""Read the instructions before use"" you really do need to sit down and read the instructions. But overall very happy with it."
4,Great so far,"This has been great so far in our marathon training. There is only one problem we have found so far and that is the elevation seems to be completely off. We have very little variation in our elevation, but the garmin seems to have us doing mountains."
5,My best buy on sports equipment so far!,"The Forerunner 305 it's a surprise, and a good one. It is surprisingly easy to use, the GPS works well (at least in open areas) and the heart monitor works well too.For me, it's a VERY good deal for the price!"
3,First Unit,"This is the first gps/heart rate monitor I've ever owned. Overall I am satisfied. There are some things that I believe could be improved with the software. For instance, you cannot (or at least I can't) open the program unless the watch is plugged in to the computer. I have not been able to ""copy and paste"" the maps (I was interested in putting it on my FB page) The calendar also does not show if you've done a workout or only scheduled it. My biggest complaint with the watch is if you are doing a stationary workout (like P90X, etc) it does not accurately record your calorie burn. I solved that by using the average bpm and plugged it into a conversion calculator and it's pretty close. (I compared it to what it said I burned on a run.) the GPS seems to work well and I have not had any issues with being unable to locate a satelite or a delay in locating. I haven't really been in deep cover with it, but I can say it will find them when I am in my basement."
4,Quality product,"I absolutely love this device. The only reason I don't give it a five is that sometimes it takes awhile to locate all the satellites when I turn it on. It has lots of cool features and I haven't even used all of them. Some of my favorite features are ""auto pause"" and running against a ""virtual partner"". The heart rate monitor is a great bonus. The computer program isn't all that great, especially for Mac. It's hard for me to imagine running (or biking, or rollerblading) without it - knowing mile markers is one thing but being able to pace yourself well and do more complicated workouts is easy with this forerunner."
1,unhappy,"Manufacturer will tell you the item's lithium battery already has a limited life of uses before it dies. First Amazon lost item, then replacement doesn't even turn on. Amazon won't replace more than once, only refund, and they don't even honor the price."
1,Bad experience with my 305 GPS,"Receiver failed after 1 month. Garmin customer service was bad, in Chile's representation they do not receive item for repair. Amazon response was excellent, I got a promt reply and instructions to return item and exchange for a new one."
4,Garmin Forerunner 305,Shipping took longer than expected but received product as advertised. I've used the Garmin 305 for 3 weeks now and so far has worked well. Would recommend to someone looking for GPS unit for running.
2,Not Great,"I'm a competitive marathoner and moved up to this from an older model, 201 I think. Anyway, I use the product for long runs, tempo runs, and especially, interval training. My eyesight is fine, but the 305's worst feature is the extremely small font makes it difficult read, especially when watching rest times, etc. for intervals. Weird, it tracks the pace ok when I'm running but often when I'm standing still it still shows a variable pace. Not overly impressed, will look for something besides a Garmin product next time although there aren't a lot of choices."
4,305 Good with some flaws,"The garmin 305 has to be amazing, because with everyone out there with smart phones all you have to do is use a free app and you get many of the same features (many blue tooth hrm now exist as well) So how good does the garmin fare over the smartphone? It is far more accurate. It takes a minute to three minutes to track onto satelites (I once had to turn it off and on again) and the battery lasts about 2 days on a full charge. I am a little disappointed with this since I was hoping for a longer battery life. The HRM is great except it is very small, favoring a large time readout rather than having a half window with a HRM taking up half of it. Do you have a smart phone? Then this isn't likely useful, get endomondo, runkeeper or another tracker and use that. This is more accurate, but ballpark figures are good enough imo. It isn't a bad product, but like the car based GPS and CD it is being replaced."
2,This thing is huge!,"Dick Tracy would have complained about the size of this thing. Enough computing power to get you to the moon and back, but just too big and ugly for me to keep."
3,The vendor is not dependable,"I purchased this item from Amazon via Digital Pavilion Electronics, and paid for 2nd day delivery. It was ordered on the 20th of December, supposed to deliver on the 22nd. Instead, it shipped on the 22nd and will deliver on the 24th. We will probably already be traveling and miss the delivery. Whatever you do, don't order from this vendor."
2,Not for walkers or those that run on treadmills.,"I am not a runner. When I am outdoors I am usually hiking or walking. When I do run, it is usually on a treadmill. I was looking for something that would help me stay in my target heart rate no matter what activity I was doing. But this item is built for runners/bikers. There isn't even an option to walk. And it won't track calories indoors.I am returning the item for these reasons. I will go back to polar."
4,Only for the most dedicated.,This is a marvel of technology. It will measure your speed and distance. Keep count of your pace and heart rate. It even will map out your course and show all of the elevation changes! It plugs into your computer and downloads all of this information so you can compare from day to day and monitor your progress.I bought this for my wife thinking that all of this information would keep her interested and challenged. She only wanted to know how long it took her each day to complete her lap of the neighborhood! It is a very cool piece of equipment but make sure that the user really wants to know more than just the time!
4,2nd Time I bought one,"I little on the bulky side compared to the 405, but it gets the job done and that's all that matters to me."
2,Buy a newer product,"The Garmin 305 that I received was defective, if I rode over a bump or moved my arms fast enough when running the device lost power.I returned it to amazon for a full refund, thanks amazon!Purchased the edge 500 for my bike, it is an awesome product so far!"
5,Love it!!!,Bought this for my husband for Valentines.... He loves it. The maps are awesome. You can also use other maps that you find online. Really cool... If you are a serious runner it is a Great buy!!!!
5,305,"The Garmin Forerunner 305 works well, a little complex to set up multi sports mode, battery life ok for me but perhaps short for full ironman competitions, downloads to a computer are easy and the Garmin Training Center program easy to use with good and flexible presentation. I have no experience with a previous model. I dont think mapping is available on the 305 itself but the Garmin Training center mapping is good. I dont know what ""Hrm function"" means."
3,garmin 305,"Great for measuring distance. Can't read the HR, too small. Painful on wrist, needs padding or a better watch band"
5,"Love it, love it, love it.","This product does what it says, works perfectly, is very easy to use, and is an overall great product. The size is not a issue with me. I like being able to read everything on the screen as I'm running. Buttons are in the right locations for turning it on/off or pausing and starting again. I wouldn't spend the money on the 405, for what this one has everything you need. Unless you're trying to impress others."
4,recommended for sure,"if u run , walk , jog , riding horses , or even cycling , get this watch and i guarantee u u will be happy , also the connection with the computer is great and giving enough info about all u need , i recommend it again and again , the only disadvantage is the size , but u`ll get used to it :)"
4,Great Item,This is the first time I have tried any type of electronic mileage log and I love it. It is great for logging miles ran each outing and totals by week or grand totals. It also gives a instant pace of minutes per mile. I've had no troubles with it so far.
4,Garmin Forerunner 305 Wrist-Mounted GPS,The unit took a couple of workout sessions to get it set up the way I wanted it. Now that I have it set up properly it has worked flawlessly. One time I rushed it and did not allow it to complete its satelite search before starting and had to stop and turn it off/on before it could locate our my position. It's distance accuracy has been consistently within .01 hundredth of a mile. The pace tends to fluctuate at times. I believe this is due to signal interference.
4,"Good Product, Excellent Value","For the price, this was an excellent value. While not very attractive to wear as a watch, like the 405, this has been a fantastic addition to my running. The watch is easy to read and is ready to go in 30 seconds. It doesn't connect wirelessly to the computer like the 405, but again, for the price, you can't beat it."
4,First month experience,"I am happy with the product,despite of negative critics I found among reviews of Garmin 305.I am using that for recording my runs(distance,pace,average speed,...)I am still in the stage of discovering the knowledge of this stuff."
5,Another Satisfied Customer,"Item was brand new (as advertised), all components listed were included and well packaged. Through Amazon I found the lowest price for the same, brand new, item that was listed elsewhere for higher prices.My Garmin Forerunner 305 is exactly what I needed to help me map and track my routes and runs. It is easy to read (I don't have to take my reading glasses with me when I am jogging) and when I get home I connect the watch to my computer and get lots of helpful data that I can use to analyze my routine. My favorite option is one that compares my previous runs with my most current run. I enjoy my Garmin so much, I plan to buy one for my daughter for her birthday."
5,great monitoring device,"I have had the 305 for a almost a month now. I LOVE it. It seems kind of big and bulky, but does not feel that way on my wrist. It is fantastic for tracking routes, giving accurate speed and distances. It has built in workouts like tempo and intervals or you can customize your own. You can set it to pause when you are not moving. The screen is nice and large and very easy to read quickly when on the go. It is very user friendly and easy to download the data onto the computer. The only downside is it can't be used for swimming which means you can't use it during a triathlon. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good basic functions, but don't get the heart rate monitor","As a distance runner, I find that this watch is a great tool for capturing items like distance, time and pace. It is also neat to be able to see a rough map of the run route. That's about it. The rest of the functions are poorly designed, difficult to set up and mostly undocumented. Unless you are a serious geek, you probably won't have the time to figure them out. That's okay. I still use the watch every time I run.The big disappointment is the heart rate monitor. Mine has never worked properly, and Garmin's tech support is no help at all. As a quick Google search will reveal, this is a widely encountered complaint. If you are looking at buying this product, maybe consider getting the package that doesn't have the heart rate monitor."
4,garmin forerunner,Absolutely worth the pennies...Brought my Marathon time down 20 minutes. My only issue is the bulkiness.
2,Very frustrated,"This thing is not worth the money. It has battery problems, it has tracking problems, it is not easy to navigate. It cannot accurately judge the distance of one lap on a certified track (regularly off by 15 meters). I say save your money and use one of the free apps on the smartphones like Runkeeper."
2,Stay away if you are using it outside the US,"Good product while it lasted. I used it in India where it stopped charging. I contacted customer service who replied after about a month, asking me to ship it some place in Taiwan! I could have bought a new one and had spare change to register myself for the Mumbai marathon had I done that. Then I was given the run-around to a local Indian office who tacked on a couple of thousand rupees to the already high estimate, citing some circa 1900 laws about Customs, Excise, Taxes, and the like.Get a regular phone with a built-in GPS that does a lot more than this one-trick pony..."
3,"Great watch, if you dont live near tall buildings","I live in downtown Chicago, which is where I do most of my running. The tall buildings really mess with the gps. Sometimes it will take 15+ minutes to get a satellite signal. Other times I will be running for an hour and says I have only gone .5 miles. This is extremely frustrating. I did however use it in SW Michigan with extreme accuracy. I guess my advice is try a different watch if you live in Chicago/NYC and plan to run near downtown."
4,Weak Band Beware,Well 3 days after Christmas and now its gone. I went mountain biking and somewhere it got knock off my wrist. The band uses a flimsy standard watch bar band to connect the band to the unit. Same as any Casio. It really needs something more substantial. I had it buckled correctly. Just beware if you are do any aggressive sports with this.Other than that it has a lot of great easy to use features.
5,Very Please with the Forerunner 305,The Garmin Forerunner 305 has been fun to use. Easy to understand set up and has good accuracy. Would recommend this model to others
4,Had to return 1st one.,"Purchased the Forerunner 305 as a gift for my wife who runs quite a bit. I charged the device as soon as we got it. It would not power on even after charging all night. It said ""Charging Complete"". I called Garmin support which tried to do a couple different resets, but nothing worked. So I returned it to Amazon. They sent a new one out which has worked perfectly. The first one must have been a lemon.Both of us have used the watch for several runs now. I think it is great. It finds satellites quickly and hasn't dropped the signal on me yet. I found it easy to use and I believe my wife does as well. I have no regrets about purchasing this watch. I'm also glad Amazon has a wonderful return policy to handle these types of failures."
