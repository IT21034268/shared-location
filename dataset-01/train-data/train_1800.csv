5,Alers Is My Favorite!,I searched high and low to find each novel written by Ms. Alers. I felt a loss when I came to the end of another and estatic when the next arrived (mail order). Careless Whispers was no exception. Well done!
2,THIS WAS A JOKE!,"I DON'T SEE HOW PEOPLE COULD GIVE THIS BOOK AT LEAST 3 STARS. I WAS VEEEEERY DISAPPOINTED. READING THE EXCERPTS GAVE ME FALSE HOPE. THIS WAS NOT A ROMANCE BOOK. IT IS ABOUT A WOMAN WITH MANY ISSUES. PLUS, SHE CRIED TOO MUCH. I'VE HEARD THAT MRS. ALERS WRITES GOOD BOOKS. WELL, THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK OF HERS THAT I HAVE READ. THIS MUST NOT HAVE BEEN HER BEST. I'M GLAD THAT I RENTED IT FROM THE LIBRARY. THIS MAY SEEM LIKE I'M A VERY RUDE PERSON. I'M JUST OUT-SPOKEN. WELL, READ IT FOR YOURSELF. YOU MIGHT LIKE IT. MIGHT."
1,Questionable and annoying,I do not recommend this dvd. I think it was thrown together. Workouts are not completed and at times there are no reps for the other side !! I would hate to walk down the street with one butt cheek firmer than the other ! I found it very annoying!
1,Not ideal,I bought this DVD and parts of it are very good but basically it's just cuts from other Taebo dvd's. Sometimes they only work one side and I found it almost too fast. Hard to keep technique when you're rushing through the moves.
2,Not effective,This DVD makes you sweat BUT not effective. They have put many different classes on one DVD and it jumps from one exercise to the next very quickly. There are some routines that are only done on the left or right side...not both. Don't waste your money.
5,Great overall exercises for the body,I have been using this video for aprox. 3 yrs. I recently moved and lost my DVD so being as good as it is I just had to buy another one. I am thinking I should buy one more just in case I move again. I feel it has been a very good investment. If you want a great investment in an overall body workout this is it.
3,"Results at first, then they go away?","Well I have been doing the ab workout on this dvd mainly. The butt workout has some parts messed up in it, where they cut off some of the workouts and so one side of your body doesnt get the full effect. (or maybe that is just my dvd?)The abs workout is pretty good. Especially the end, when you actually lay on the floor. I tend to find the floor work more effective. Some pretty good crunches, and side crunches. There is also a lot of standing up and balancing moves- which takes practice, I still have to hold onto something at times...but overall this workout is pretty good. I am still looking for something to top it!"
4,GREAT RESULTS!,"I was very excited about purchasing this dvd, but when I actually did the workout, I realised that it was clips from other taebo dvd which was misleading. I still continue to use this dvd because it gives the results that I want so it has not been a complete waste. Billy often does more repetition to one side of the body, but that is not a big deal for me, as long as I work up a good sweat and get the results that I want. I probably would not purchase the Ultimate lower and upper body dvd because it might be just extracts from his other workouts. I think that it should be specified if his workout are copies of other dvds/clips because it is so unfair and misleading. It will give us a better choice if we want to purchase it."
5,FABULOUS!,"If you enjoy Jim Brickman, you will LOVE Wil Burns. Incredibly novel pieces and masterful performances! A must-have for relaxing after a long day...."
5,A Little Something,"Compilation of relaxing music. I put it on at home or in the office whenever I feel the need to unwind. Great while reading. It will surely be one of my ""most-frequently-played."""
3,overall good but na on the phrasing,"Overall this story was quite good.I felt Joan Wolf maybe took a page out of the whole Roman/Sabine women story and explored it.While I enjoyed reading it, her attempt to immerse us a bit in the culture/world with the phrasing of ""sa"" and ""na"" ended up just annoying me. It is the main reason Horsemasters (set in a similar time period with same phrasing) is just not one of my favorites even though I liked the story even better than this one."
3,I liked it,I don't judge books by anything other then did it hold my interest. I know very simple but hey it's me. I could pick it apart but I really liked it. I thought her prespective of prehistoric life was a little far fetched but it's a book. I liked the characters and the setting. If you are looking for a nice beach or travel book this is a good one.
5,"64,000 dollar question !!!!!","NIGHT GALLERY SEASON THREE , THE 64,000 DOLLAR QUESTION ...WILL IT HAVE THE EPISODE ""WITCHES FEAST"" !!!!! (SEASON 2 , EPISODE 8) LET'S HOPE SO !!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I find this season not worth buying (though I did buy it), it is much worse than the two previous seasons, no new ideas, rather mediocre stories."
2,Night Gallery: Season three,"To whom it may concern;I hav'nt viewed it yet. I've been very busy lately.I received it about two weeks ago but will hopefully enjoy it and soon.Sincerely Yours;Michael Leon.P.s. The vignette: ""Smile, Please"" is not in this or the other seasons."
3,Interesting,"I have the first two season so decided to get the last one. Nice that they has the ""lost"" episodes.--DJS"
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are expecting the same type of stories from seasons 1 and 2, don't get your hopes up. The quality of season 3 is significantly diminished."
2,Serling could have done MUCH better,Just does not compare to the Twilight Zone. Sorry Rod. I was hoping that it might come close but sad to say it did not.
3,just a few great stories,"I read the recommending reviews and bought the DVD. I was hoping there would be more ""twilight zone like"" episodes,but was dismayed by the simple uninteresting scripts,including the missing episodes without any ending of sorts.it's a good thing this was their last season..time to look for more related DVDs of the unknown dimension..not highly recommended"
4,"Great Series... no Twilight Zone, but...","A great series, but still not Twilight Zone and sort of a sad decline for Rod Serling. The power he had to create TZ in the 1960s was rare at the time and even today, and what he created was incredible. Even though this is in color, it's more interesting for it's kitsch value and Serling's participation and a great lens into TV of the early 1970s."
5,Great movie great transaction,"I received the DVD in great condition. As a new Night Gallery fan, I didn't know what to expect the first episode alone was awesome! Reminds me of the Twilight Zone...and since I've seen all of them already, Night Gallery is great!"
5,An Older Guide book,"This is an older guide book but is still useful if you have it. Otherwise I recommend that you get the newer up to date versions. After all this one, while good in its day, is now almost 8 years old."
3,cross crunch,"the cross crunch is easy to use and assemble, workout is not too intense, would not recommend for those looking for a real good aching work out."
1,Did Nothing....,"I had this a couple of years back and used it daily. It seemed like it was doing a good job, but it was me being in denial. I ended up giving it away to someone that thought it would work, but suffered the same fate. DO NOT GET THIS!!!!"
5,Red Talons can be so loved after this book!!!,"I had always seen Red Talons as the bullies of the werewolves. Never thought they had that much to them, and I had figured out they were simple minded.And then I met Storm Eye. And I really thought she had a story to tell. Her character and her story are so great that I wanted to know more about her. The mistakes she do, how she learn from them, and the goo things that come her way and are earned by her... Astonishing, really!And the Fianna book... well, what can I say? I'm really into Fiannas, and just to see how one of them just come and saves the day is great!"
1,Stupid censored version,Find the unrated uncut version. More blood and gore. Thats why you bought this movie right. Four more words required
2,Not the right picture.,"The picture shown was for the unrated cut, but what I got was the r rated cut, which is pointless to own as it cuts out everything."
1,GET UNCUT VERSION!,"BE AWARE! Make sure if you are to buy this film to not buy the R-rated version!What a disappointment it was to start watching this and slowly realize ALL of the gore wasn't in it. Who's bright idea was it to put out an R-rated version of Blood Feast 2? When someone buys a movie called Blood Feast 2, they want to see gore haha Not everything but. But I do realize it's mostly my fault for not checking before I bought it. I was just too excited. So with that being said, I'm divided on which way I should rate this item, because the movie uncut is a masterpiece. It's so funny and super gory, but the R-rated version is a damn shame. Since it's the item I'm rating I'm going to give it one star because it's the R-rated version. The movie deserves a solid six....Now I have to cough up more money for the real version. I hope this helps people not make the same mistake I made."
5,"In the R version, more funny than gorey!","I first saw the R rated version of this that had about 6 minutes of gore cut, resulting in this tame version to have little gore. Still, I liked this movie! The gore level was low but this movie redeemed itself with its comedy and sexy scenes!!! This still was a hell of a good film even without the gore! Later I bought the unrated uncut version which is the orgiinal film with all 6 minutes of gore put back. It still basically is the same movie with or without the gore, but the unrated movie just featured extended scenes of unneeded storyless torture, violence, disembowlment and even more that was kinda fake looking,but still at a gross out level. I liked this movie with or without the gore, but for those gore hounds out there, check out the unrated version, cause this has wall to wall with gore!!"
3,Better than expected sequel....40 years later!,"You've never seen acting this bad? Have you seen the original BLOOD FEAST????!!!This was far better than I was expecting. It is a bit overlong at 100 minutes, but fans of the original will want to check this out. John Waters has a funny bit as a priest!This works better than other recent belated sequels such as COPRSE GRINDERS 2 or MARK OF THE ASTRO ZOMBIES, which were shot on tape. BLOOD FEAST 2 is film all the way!"
2,Not Classic HGL...,"I wanted to like this movie because I like HGL in interviews, I love his commentaries on his older DVD's, and I like horror. Campy horror is okay, exploitation films are great, gore is fine by me. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. The good? Well, this is the type of film where women decide to have a ""lingere shower"" prior to a wedding and model said lingere for each other. More nudity than you can shake a stick at. The bad? Most everything else. The jokes are occasionally funny, but mostly just terribly unfunny. The acting is miserable because it seems intentionally bad (one of the hallmarks of a good bad movie is that it wants to be good). Fuad Ramses III is cringe-inducing; the music is over used and too campy; the script is closer to ""Hell Asylum"" than ""2,000 Maniacs."" If you like gore flicks, stick with the original."
3,"Good graphics, boring game play and story line",I had hoped for a more entertaining game with a richer story line--like most mario games are. This was rather repetitive and didn't hold my attention or my son's attention for very long. It works well with the wii with some frustrating moves that might have been easier to figure out if there were a quick example or something.
3,Could have been better,"This game is really fun the first time you play it but as you go on in the story it becomes boring. It takes forever to beat the game with Mario. After that, you need to beat the game with Luigi. So when I even got to around 50 or 60 stars, I just thought this was boring and there would be no point playing this, so I moved on. The transformations of Mario are fun especially boo mario and bee mario. Before it came out, I wanted it badly, but as you can see, my luck turned. Otherwise, this game is pretty fun, but Nintendo could have done a better job on this."
3,It's meee Mario!!,"What's there to say about mario that hasn't been said? The game looks stunning. the plot is ""been there, done that"" but at least they added some characters and kept things moving. The controls are easy to get used to and it's almost never a case of trying to do something and failing due to the controls. If you're a hard core gamer it will be short overall, but for regular playing this will be a great to do over spring or maybe even summer break..."
5,Super Mario Galaxy,The game was in perfect condition! Came before it said it should have by 2 days!! I love the game and I suggest it to alot of my friends!!
4,Really fun,"Its a really fun game, I get nervous I am going to fall off the planets...Worth the money."
4,very creative!,i bought this for my brother in law for christmas and he has not stopped playing it...it has very cool graphics and it is almost 3-Dnice game...good job Nintendo
5,Hands down the best video game in years!!!,"I love this game. The first time I played it, I felt like I did when I got my first Nintendo 17 years ago after playing Atari for years: it makes all of the games I've played before seem obsolete. A fantastic game for the Wii platform. Very worthy new title of the Super Mario saga. Everyone I know who has played it-loves it. Buy it today; you won't have a moment's regret."
5,So much fun!!,"I've had this game since it was released. It is a REALLY fun game that reminds me of my middle school days of Super Mario Brothers. Once you get used to using the Wii controllers for this type of game, it's really easy for anyone to play. The graphics are incredible and the musical score is truly impressive. It still amazes me how much depth this game has. Even my husband and I will play this game together when we get to difficult rounds.Beware that this is NOT a party game, just a really great Mario game."
5,"Fun game, great use of Wii Controls!","I am an avid fan of the Mario series, and this game did not disappoint. Many challenging levels, age appropriate even for my younger nieces and nephews, and lots of fun!"
4,A complete new way of playing Mario games.,"I've playing video games, specially nintendo, since little kid. And i played lots of mario bros. Diferent versions games. All of them have something in common, on the way (method) you play, until i found this. The Mario Galaxy is fun, is diferent (you have to pla 360 degrees screen), have a complete way to confront your enemies and the obstacules that are in your way.The graphics are good also the sound and the music for the game. The concept is and story is good too. What i believe should be change is the 2player mode. Maybe could it be better if instead of the second player just be a little star that help you out Mario, will it be better if it is another character of the game??.However overall the game is good, fun and makes you think, which i believe is one of the main charateristics that we should look on video games."
4,Fun but Complecated,This game was fun but it was complecated after awhile. Once i got stuck on one level i quit. But fun overall. But now it is at Game Stop. Lol.
4,"I feel a bit too old for it, well made solid game though","I'm in my late 20s and this game seems to be geared at a younger audience. Not to say that its not fun, and it is definitely well made. I guess I've just grown out of video games a bit, and I feel too old to play this one.I think most people know what to expect from this game - Nintendo has always done a great job with this series. I would recommend this game to anyone 18 and younger that has enough free time to enjoy it."
4,"Slow to start, but becomes pretty cool","The game starts slowly and with some of the initial 3-Dimensionality being a little overwhelming. But after a couple quick stars, the game picks up and becomes pretty fun. I'd recommend it. The only other games I've bought are mariokart (best game ever) and zelda, which I haven't gotten started on yet."
3,Not multi-player,"This game has beautiful graphics and is quite fun for a single player, or for a single player with a backup companion (that's really only a helper, not a full player). It's a shame it's not a multi-player game ala the new Super Mario Brothers game. I have three kids and all would like to play."
3,Great Game but not for toddlers,"This game is top rated for the Wii and seems to be challenging, all good things. So far, though I would not use the word intuitive to describe playing it. We need instructions to understand how to play two players and how to maximize our location. Any of the guides out there would probably be helpful, I'll let you know!"
3,Not for me,"I bought this game based on the glowing reviews, both at amazon and elsewhere.I have to admit that I'm disappointed. I found the game to be childish. There was excessive dialogue that i couldn't skip past. Spent way too much time reading from fairy-like creatures.Graphics are good, actually great by Wii standards, and i don't doubt this is the best mario bros for wii. Found gameplay to be very easy, but granted, i've only played an hour, so i've only conquered the easiest levels.Overall, this game was not ust not for me. I much prefer a game like guitar hero, but that's just this 30 year old male's opinion. I'm sure younger folk would adore this game. I don't doubt other non-kids like this game too. Just not for me.Personally, i doubt i'll log another hour into the game."
2,Dizzy Dizzy Dizzy,I had extreme motion-sickness with this game. I didnt think the game was very much fun either.
2,Disappointed,"According to my eight year old, this game is not very fun and too difficult for her age group."
4,Great game -somewhat disappointmented,"Graphics are beautiful, fun to watch - like an interactive movie, but disappointed that it is mostly played by a single player (a 2nd player can shoot at stars, but that seems a little boring). Wish both players could play the actual levels, even if they took turns switching back and forth between mario and luigi like the old super mario bros used to."
5,"Challenging, but still very,very,very,fun!","Super Mario Galaxy is fun,fun,fun!Not as challenging if you've beaten other Mario games, but even if you have'nt, the first parts aren't very hard. I play it for hours!"
5,Outstanding!,Brief and to the point. Buy it - you will be amazed by the game graphics and design. I have not seen my 66 year old wife for days since she bought it :)
5,What use is a game if it doesn't bring out the child in you?,"Super Mario Galaxy is something special. It is filled with adventure, humor, suspense and most of all, enjoyment.On the weekend, I played with my three year old nephew. I controlled direction via the nunchuck and gave him the wiimote.I kinda thought he would get bored very quickly but the little guy was an absolute genius picking the game up! When I wanted him to attack something I yelled ""shake it!"" and he swiftly took care of all the cutest bad-guys you could possibly imagine! When I yelled ""FLY!"" he had no problem pressing the ""A"" button and sending Bee-mario buzzingly up into the sky! He was absolutely enthralled and loving it!This game is class. Perfect for kids and rejuvenating for adults.This holiday season, don't delay - this is the game you MUST play!"
5,Simply amazing.,"This is easily the best of the Super Mario series since the original. The graphics are outstanding, especially for a ""Mario game."" The co-star mode is very unique, very useful, and very fun. The Wiimote fits in very well; it doesn't have that ""forced"" feeling that certain other games have. The platforms, the enemies, the changing gravity, the new moves... everything presents a new challenge to gamers of all ages.Put simply, this game is a *MUST HAVE* for any Wii owner."
4,FANTASTIC!,"Review by my son who is 8 years old and a good video gamer:Super Mario Galaxy is great. The power-ups, the graphics, the animation - it's all great, although I burned through the whole game in a week. It wasn't that challenging. The camera does not always track Mario well while he's upside down, which can make him hard to control. But after I finished the game, it was so fun that I kept playing and found 35+ more stars."
4,Good Mario Game,I have to admit when I first saw the screen prints of this game I thought it was going to be awful and wrote it off as a bad game. Then I was in Bestbuy and they had it set up where you can play it so I thought let me give it a try. I was so surprised how much fun the game was that I got it that day.The game is a lot of fun and controling mario is very easy. The premise of the game is that these star bits have been lost amongst different galaxies. Mario has to ghather them all up and then for save Peach. I enjoy the game a lot and am so glad I had an opportunity to play the game or I would have missed out on one of the best Wii games
5,Awesome,I bought this for my 5 year old and I will admit to sitting and playing with him. The graphics on this game are incredible. It is a lot of fun. Great eye-hand coordination needed. I love it and so does my son. lol.
3,"Fun, but frustrating for a new gamer","I rented this game because I heard how much fun Mario can be. I can say that I had a GREAT time playing and was about ready to go buy the game, and then it happened...I got to a candy planet that had all of these holes you had to jump across to get to the end. There were like 3 different platforms that became increasingly harder to pass and there were energy bars you had to jump while on a moving platform, dodging holes. EEK! It was so hard, I had my boyfriend try to pass it. He's been a gamer forever so I figured he'd rock it out. No such luck. It kept killing him and the main frustration is that it always takes you back to the beginning of the very first platform. I wish it would start you at the beginning of the platform where you died. If you don't finish each planet, you won't get new ones to play on, and I don't see how anyone can finish this planet. I am very sad, because I really liked the other challenges."
3,Mario Galazy,"Not as great as I expected. Seemed to be another Mario64 with harder to master controls. Some people think this is the greatest game ever, I tend to think it a rent before you buy, I'm glad I did. Overall, seemed to be a great game, just not as good as I expected. Nothing as revolutionary as Mario64 was and I guess the running upside down on planets just felt auckward(sp?). Maybe if I devoted more than a few hours to it, but I lost interest quickly."
5,Great Game!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the first game that I bought for the Wii. After reading the rview and everything this seemed to be the top game. I wasnt disappointed either. It has some great graphics and is a great addition to the mario game family. It takes alittle bit to figure out the controls but after that it is game on. Mario sets out to find Princess Peach who is taken to another galaxy by Bowser. Mario can fly, skates, jump, throw fire, throw ice. Mario in a 3-d world is cool after playing him in all of the old 2-D worlds. This is classic mario just stepped up a notch and it doesnt disappoint."
5,Very Well Done (coming from an old school gamer),"I grew up with the OG NES and SNES Mario Games. I pretty much quit gaming around the time N64 got halfway thru it's life cycle. So it's safe to say the 3-d world of gaming is quite foreign to me. That said...i finally bought a Wii in late 2010, my first New console in like 8 years. And to my surprise, Mario Galaxy is an Amazing easy to pick up and play game. Within 30-40 minutes i had the control scheme down and was really enjoying myself. The graphics are amazing, controls are too on point, and everything in between....just an exceptional game. This alone makes buying my Wii worth it. Nintendo obviously put a lot of time and effort into this and it shows. A+ 10/10 I Love it"
5,The trippiest game I have ever played.,"I am the type who is always wary of over-hyped games because quite often they do not deliver. So when I started the game, I was prepared to be maybe let down a little. HOWEVER, 30 minutes into the game, I had to sit back and take account of how much FUN I was having playing this game. You will go upside down, right side up hurtling through space and back again, and it will feel like second nature to you. The attention to detail and the excellent automatic camera keep you focused on what is true mario platformer action. This is a no-brainer - buy it now if you have a wii."
1,you have to use the Nunchuck?,"This game is suppose to be the end all to mario..Not. The way you have to use the controllers are annoying. You also have to sit through many movies and boring talking scenes etc. It is difficult to control the Character and many times you are not sure where you should be going. Tends to be confusing and the instruction that come with it do not help.Overall the graphics are good(480 max res) for Wii. My seven year old likes it because he does not try to figure out what to do he just plays wherever he is. I do not understand all the Hype. Super Mario for Wii IS INDEED A GREAT GAME. Much, Much better than this one.Spend your 50 bucks on that one not this one."
1,I hate it!!!,"I hate Super Mario Galaxy! The game was to hard, to long, and when you beat it you don't get the extra galaxy! I don't even know why they are making a second one cause the first one sucked so bad! If I were you don't waist your money and time with this game! I highly suggest that you will be happier with Super Mario Sunshine for the Gamecube! I had a great and fun time playing that game and I still play it today! And again DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a total waist of money!"
1,Another rehash from the 80s,"Many associate the Mario games with fun. I associate the name Mario for one mediocre platformer from the 80s/90s and a load of marketing hype and crazed fanboys.There's no real story, the weak and uninteresting main character has no personality, the platforming has been done better before, all the ""innovations"" - most of them eon-old rehashes - feel forced, no sense of completion can be gained and the ""fun"" the game radiates seems false.I suggest playing Spyro the Dragon for PS1 instead."
1,It's okay.,"When I couldn't skip over the opening cinematic; when my roommate kept using the second controller to make me jump to my death; when my roommate kept using the second controller to shoot me with my meteorites; when I couldn't adjust the camera to keep track of Mario, I shut this thing off and went back to ""Sea Monsters.""Also, there were way too many jitneys in this game."
4,Caution; may make your head spin,"I found a great deal on this game, it had great reviews and the classic characters I love, so in my cart it went. However, with one use my head was spinning. I would not recommend this game if you easily get motion sickness. Soon as my 7 yr old nephew and 5 yr old neice got their hands on it, I could not get my wii system back until their mom picked them up from my place. Hopefully I can one day run in circles around the planets!"
5,Awesome!,"I love the Mario games on Nintendo, but this is totally different! It's lots of fun. I can't wait to get through the entire game!"
5,Mario never let us down!,My boyfriend and I play this game together. It's much more fun than I thought it would be. It's a great game for all levels. It's best for one player but can be played by two people. Mario never let us down!
5,Excellent Game,Really fun to play. Two player really sucks though bc the 2nd player only shoots stars. Not really engaging for the 2nd person. Games and puzzles are really fun and engaging.
5,DIVERSE GAMEPLAY!,"This game has exciting action without blood and gore and I love blood and gore! The views are spectacular in some of the galaxies. This game is huge, hours upon hours of gameplay! I can't think of once where there was a dull moment playing this game, that says a lot. DIVERSE GAMEPLAY!5 / 5"
5,Another Great Mario Game,My husband LOVES this game. I've watched him play it many times. The graphics are great and it is quite challenging.
5,You can't own a Wii without owning a Mario game!,"I'm a huge fan of all the mario games. i was addicted to super mario 64 and was so excited to start playing this on the wii. the new controls w/ the wii remote and the nunchuck are superb, you can still do all the old trick that we all remember from before, but there are so many new things mario can do now. i'm 25 years old and i find this game addictive and challenging still. even though it gets a bit frustrating at times (falling off and dying lol), it's still very relaxing. and if you're not in the mood to stand up and wave your arms around, this is the perfect game for sitting down and relaxing. it's a great game with a lot of new concepts.the only thing that's a bit annoying is the inability to control the camera angles, sometimes it gets a bit hard to see where mario is going when he's upside down! :)"
5,A must have,"Pros:Sets the graphical bar for the Wii with 16x9, 480p support (with the component cable), very fluid animation that never drops below 60fps, great lighting and textures. The controls are very intuitive and easy to learn. The game makes great use of the wiimote and nunchuck controller Extrememly fun, Innovative, and addictive gameplay (even for a mario game).Cons:I understand that it is rated E for everyone but sometimes it feels TOO MUCH like a kids game. Not very challenging (luckily there is a lot of gameplay here)."
2,Save option terrible,"I haven't seen many reviews mention what is the worst aspect of the game. It goes right back to the Dark Ages (the early 90's) with its terrible save option which means you have to do a ton of stuff over and over again before getting to the point where you last were. This completely ruins it. Maybe the 'retro' aspect of this game also had a 'retro' appalling save element in it, but it makes the game unplayably tedious"
3,MARIO GALAXY,"THIS PRODUCT REQUIRES BOTH THE Wii CONTROLLER AND THE NUNCHUCK. IT LOOKS LIKE GREAT FUN FOR THE KIDS UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T DO THE NUNCHUCK PORTION. THE GRANDKIDS (AGES 13 & 9) WERE ABLE TO PICKUP THE GAME AND USE IT RIGHT AWAY."
3,This game is NOT challenging...too easy :(,"Don't get me wrongl; the graphics are top-notch and the score is great, but this game is way too easy. I have a feeling Nintendo purposefully made it a little easier since more and more adults are playing the Wii nowadays, and Nintendo wanted to grab their attention. I mean, Mario Sunshine and Mario 64 were challenging, but fun. Galaxy, however, you can complete a course within minutes, and you die very rarely. But, the game is enjoyable...worth $50? Probably not..."
2,Not impressive in any way.,I really don't understand the appeal of this game. There is nothing impressive or original in this game. The control is terrible. You'll waste a lot of time falling off of the edges of the planets into outer space and starting all the way over. The graphics are fine for the Wii but the Wii is really just a gamecube. You spend most of your time running around and jumping on beetles or shooting stars into marshmellow aliens mouths. I'm pretty much the only person I know that doesn't like this game so you'll probably love it but I just had to say something.
2,different,"I haven't played it yet, but i watched my son.. it seems to be more difficult and i am not a fan of how its all done on circular planets.. makes for a harder view on things.. i prefer super mario 64.."
5,This is one fun game,We just started playing this games and it already has us hooked.I was taking turns playing this game with my wife with my other younger daughter on the second remote helping to collect stars and helping out. It was very addictive. The kids wanted to see what would happen next on the next planet.The graphics and gameplay were great. I did not think I would get into the game but I was totally wrong. It definitely made playing Mario fun. I have a few other games for the wii but this game is becoming a favorite.
5,Coolest Wii Game EVER!!!!!!,"I loved this game! I got it for Christmas from my brother, Clint so I've only had it for a month.But ive beat the ENTIRE GAME already!Id say its the funnest game ive ever played besides super mario 64 ds. Those games are pretty much alike. Any way, I LOVED THIS GAME SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!! Id recommend it for people 9-100. Im ten years old. Almost 11. 5 stars!"
5,my favorite wii game,So much fun. I especially like how long it takes to complete. Its like the old Mario games in that regard. So many newer games can be beat in a week and then you're stuck with an expensive game you'll never play again. Its fantastic.
5,Mario saves the universe!,"Super Mario Galaxy is a great game! The graphics are amazing, and it has very good movie scenes. In the game, Mario has to stop Bowser from becoming the empire of the universe, which is a very good idea for an interesting story.The game does not always use motion on the wii remote to play. You normally just shake the remote to use a sling star to take you to the next planet in the galaxy. But sometimes you have to tilt the remote to ride on a ray for ray surfing or balancing on a ball. Throughout the game you have to point at the screen to collect star bits, which you collect to find secret galaxys.The game progressively gets much harder, trust me. But the game can't lose stars for that because if it were not hard, it wouldn't be fun. The game is creative too so how couldn't it be fun?Super Mario Galaxy is a must buy along with any Mario game! Buy it, Buy it! You will become a Mario fanatic!!!"
4,Great play,This game is just another addition to the supper mario epicAlthough the camra angles are a little tough to get the hang of it's fun upgrades over come that issue with ease. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone under 7 because it can get tricky at times but to everyone else it's a fun and exiting game
4,the new mario,"i grew up playing mario, and this game gave mario a new meaning. amazing grafics and animation. it is a challenging game, but fun to play. te second player has almost no role, so as an advice, unless you want to entertain your kids play it alone. BUT AWSOME GAME"
5,MARIO ROCKS!,"I STARTED PLAYING THE MARIO GALAXY 2 FIRST, AND I WANTED TO KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.WHEN I PLAY A NEW MARIO I ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING. I REVIEW IT LIKE A MOVIE. THIS ONE HAS THE BEST MUSIC, GREAT CHARACTERES (WE HAVE LIVED WITH THEM FOR 25 YEARS SO FAR), FOR ME WAS NICE TO HAVE THE OPTION TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE STARS WE WIN.MARIO IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE!"
3,I just didn't really enjoy it,"I had high hopes for this game. I played the heck out of the earlier generations of the Mario games, and since I just got a Wii, I was looking forward to wasting...er, spending a lot of time playing this one. Although I liked the 3-D effect, and running upside down, I found going from world to world very repetitive and I got bored quickly. I like the ""shake"" action but missed jumping on foes' heads. I liked how some of the old-school sounds were there (like the sound for going into a tube), but I really missed the old orientation. Here, you solve puzzles at each stage. In the old one, you just had to make it by the finish line alive. I returned this one, very sad."
1,Outdated old software,"Macromedia has replaced the numberd product lines with the MX Series. Dreamweaver MX replaces this bundle, why buy outdated software look for dreamwaever MX."
4,One piece grand adventure,i liked this game a lot. i was really confused about the concept of unlocking characters and cards and basically everything. but i probably just need to look online to see how to do everything. otherwise the graphics are really good for a gamecube game along with the gameplay. it is really fun and sometimes can be challenging. i liked it a lot.
5,great gift for my son,I had bought this game for my son for Christmas and he loves it!!! He is a big fan of One peice and the product was in great as well as the service from Hitgaming. Chris is always willing to help the customers so I will be a returning customer.
3,So-So,"Any new version Of Wheel Of Fortune is a vast improvement over the old PC and NES versions... As for this version--->If you can find the First Hasbro version get it... For A 2nd edition WOF is ok to play, but the graphics are kinda lame. The new themed backgrounds are cool, it doesnt help the game play, which is slow. I just wished they would have stuck with the nice layout of the First PSX version and improved it, this seems like a new attempt at this game. Definatly get this if you have gone thru every puzzle in the first version, or if you want to get it before it is gone. If this is your first WOF, find the original edition... I think that was more than my 2 cents worth!"
5,Give me a Y!,"I'm a game lover, my girlfriend is a game lover, my family loves games, and her family loves games. So we're always playing games whether cards, board games, our PS2 or my parents wii. There is no wrong WOF from all the versions I've played. WOF can't do wrong. Although I do have to say its kind of fun to make fun of Vanna White or the computer contestants. This is my review of any WOF, any system. Its an entertaining classic game."
4,"Good, not perfect","I purchased these Kuryakyn Wing pedals to replace my Harley's foot pegs. These were just what I was looking for; size was great, looked terrific too, and the price, while not cheap, was fair. Installation was quick and easy. My only complaint was that the rubber strips were not glued or securely connected to the pedals -- leaving me concerned that they would become dislodged due to wind on the underside while riding. My solution was to glue them myself. I expected more from Kuryakyn, but they are working fine and I like their looks. Amazon delivery service was quick."
3,Vrod floorboards,The floorboards are great. Except on the right foot my heal wants to hit the exhaust. Getting used to moving my foot but feel awkward. Mine are on a 04 V-rod.
5,Great Text for Learning,"This is a great text for learning basic rhetorical criticism techniques. This is not the newest version, but it works if you're getting it for information and not for a specific course"
2,Way Too Fluffy for My Taste,"This book should have been called ""Beautiful Interior Designs that Happen to Include some Home Theater Gear"", or ""Home Theater Style"". It's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate HT gear, and often in a laughable way. The text is fluffy, thowaway stuff that is irritating to read.The photos are very well done, but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables. Of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either. I guess that's the main thing that got to me -- if you're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room, at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible. Don't just leave them out altogether. It's insulting, and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about HT."
4,Best reference guide for home theaters on the market,"This was a great resource for me and my wife's new house. We just bought a home in the Palisades and didn't have a clue how to convert an old den downstairs into a home theater/media room. This book walks you through the steps in a really easy to understand fashion. So when it came to hiring the people to install the system and design it, I actually knew what I was talking about and could direct the action!"
5,Great A/V Guide,This book is an excellent recourse for anybody trying to integrate a/v elements to their home. It helped me turn my 1906 craftsman bungalow into an a/v wonderland.
2,OK GAME,"My friend had this game already and said it was the best game he had. So I went to Wal-Mart and bought it. In my mind this game is not that fun! Unless you like driv'n around making lots of noise, out running cops and playing levels that are similar to the one you just beat don't get this game. Oh yeah, and if you do decide to buy it what ever you do don't link up with anyone to race. It will erase all of your progress and you can't even race against each other."
3,"Good but dated, only for beginners","This book provides a good introduction to the basics of both the special and the general Theory of Relativity. I do not, however, like its style entirely. It is a little dated, too. For example, for the special part of the theory, the author sticks to Cartesian tensors only, which is advantageous only from the vantage of a student interested in... Special Relativity! This wastes time; moreover, I regard the choice of x_4 = ict unfortunate. Finally, despite the book being only 205 pages long and covering a reasonable amount of basic stuff, the style is wordy.Study elsewhere (the book by D'Inverno is OK, the ones by Schutz and Wald rock), and if you feel the need for practice with some elementary point, go for the exercises in this book."
3,Cute but....,Cute product but arrived broken... should have been packaged better considering a lot package carriers don't care about how they handle items.
5,Super book-super deal,I received this very quickly and received a very nice pretty book--get book for any pastel artist --I highly recommend
2,Gives us a bass,"I believe that Douglas Dawson is a sincere teacher, but I found this book to be a litany of rules, tricks, and gew-gaws for obtaining effects -- without a governing vision. (Contrast the similarly-named ""Capturing Radiant Color in Oils"" by Susan Sarback, which is above all a book about seeing and reporting what you see, and in spite of its title the most helpful book I have found for my approach to pastels.) Some of Dawson's rules are in the category of ""duh!"" and others make no sense. His points are usually illustrated by his own work, including landscapes (quite interesting), cityscapes (often dramatically lit but oddly unmoving), and portraits (sappy, sentimentalized, and including a few real bodice-rippers). The old saw says, ""give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime."" Dawson gives us a bass, and not a very fresh one."
2,I wanted this to be better than it is.,"With all the glowinig reviews I read, I was eager to get this mix and ordered 12. I am totally disappointed. There is no strong spice taste to separate this from any other mix. I am very dissapointed and I followed the receipe to the letter.Jim"
1,Cincinnati chili,I followed the instructions to the letter and the result was the sweetest chili that has passed my lips. I ordered 6 of the packages and would be willing to give the rest of them away! Just pay postage.
3,Mediocre at Best,"I really wanted to like this chili mix more than I did. I'm not from Ohio, so I was previously unfamiliar with Cincinnati-style chili. The problems with this chili include:- too much cinnamon flavor- too soupy (recipe calls for 6 cups of water!)- no heatIt wasn't bad, but I'm unsure why this particular brand has a following. I have five more packets so I'm need to use them up. I will heavily doctor the recipe next time.2.5 stars"
5,Crowd Pleaser!!,"Even guests who have never heard of Cincinnati Chili love it. I make several batches at a time and freeze the leftovers for easy meals later. Three tips for perfect chili: First, boil the meat in water by itself and then drain off all of the fatty water. Second, I put the chunks of boiled hamburger meat in the Cuisinart to give it a smoother and less chunky appearance before I add it to the other ingredients. Also, I use about half of the water that it calls for on the back of the packet. Otherwise it would take too many hours to boil it down and you would end up with watery chili. When I defrost what I have frozen, I will add a little water to thin it out a bit. By far, one of the favorite meals of all my guests. Sooooo much easier than making it from scratch and I think it tastes just a good."
3,okay,The packets were a bit hard like they were old and stale. I am using them anyway its just seasoning.
2,Ring too small,"The 3mm gold ring was too small. I believe it was not a size 7, since I have ordered several rings online and they have fit. Sorry I will be returning it."
4,Good Chili,"I had this chili on a recent visit to a little store in Naples, FL. and really enjoyed it. As a basic chili it is great for hot dogs. You can also spice it up with more meat and add peppers and onions and whatever suits you. It is a good basic chili and has just the right spice."
4,Spicier than I thought,It's delicious but much spicier than I expected. A little bit goes a REALLY long way.
5,Amazing!,So tasty!! I need a few more packs... Will order more as soon as I run out.WHY they don't sell this in CALIFORNIA?? They are missing a HUGE market out here.
4,"Good stuff, Maynard!","This was my family's ""chili"" until we moved from the Midwest to the Southwest, when we learned what REAL chili is. BUT we still love a steaming bowl of Cincinati chili too, whenever we can get it.This stuff sure fills the need. Believe me!"
4,Enemies keep coming!!!!,"When I ordered this game, I had high hopes for it. When it came, I started right away. On Episode IV, Chapter 5, you have to build a big doorway. When the stormtroopers came in, it was almost impossible to finish the level. It was very frustrating. It was still very fun to play as Darth Vader. So, if you plan on helping your kids through the game, then go ahead and try it. I would still recommend this to anyone, because this game has some cool scenes."
4,Fun for kids,My 7 year old boy loves this game. It does have some areas that are tricky but he absolutely loves this game.
1,Frustrating Glitches,"Loved playing the game until the end, where 2 major glitches occur making it impossible to finish. Game freezes console in Super Story Episode VI in Endor when your character crosses the creek, and again in Death Star as you escape. Read the forum boards at both Lucas Arts and Xbox 360, then decide if you want that much frustration. Lucas Arts is unresponsive to inquiries about bug fixes for these problems. What a shame for such a fun game for the entire family to be released with such problems, and for Lucas Arts to ignore its customers. I am returning mine."
2,Kind of sad,"I'll keep this review short.I don't like this game. It feels very clunky, and the level design(for all three movies) isn't good. Example: On the Return of the Jedi level 1. You can use Luke Skywalker, and slice through Gimmorian guards with your lightsaber. Well, it's more like blocking with your lightsaber until their attacks are done, and then hitting them 3, or 4 times to stop them. This gets old realy, really fast. Especially since they keep constantly popping out and attacking. It's the equal of cutting a steak with a butter knife. It's just plain awkward. Overall this game just felt rushed, and I was shocked that so many game reviewers gave it good marks. Indiana Jones Lego is so much more superior that I can't even put the two games on the same level. I'm hoping the Batman Lego game is done well like Indiana Jones was."
3,"A cheap, fun diversion...","A simple fun game that follows the movies fairly closely. Nice clean graphics and simple controls make for a good fun experience. Lots of extras for those that wish to put in the extra time, however by the time you finish the game the monotonous simple game-play will probably have lost your interest. Still a pretty cOoL game."
4,viusually colorful and interesting storyline,"i was finding myself looking at the camera angles and colorful shots of this movie........it was bright fast interesting and if truthful sad........All the acting was good and no cursing that i noticed anyway, which makes it alot easier to watch for me.The last review told you the w hole story but it was worth the price.........."
5,keelguard install,"Worked great. Follow the instructions to a ""T"". Installed in the evening, did help to put it in the sun for about 30 min as I preped the keel. Took the boat out the following day for the weekend. With a 6,000 plus pound boat I was skeptical, but worked great, got one scuff on the keel gurad after being beached off and on, over 10 times through a 3 day weekend. No sign of peeling off, very happy."
3,You get what you pay for!,In my opinion the boots don't look bad at all. I think they are a great style. But they are cheap. The Man made materials are very thin and is far from feeling like leather. if you look close you can see its not leather but if they are on you're feet who will know? I bought these for my Girl friend so I have no clue how they feel on you're foot. The one MAIN thing i did not like is the sole of these boots are almost like a hard plastic for grip instead of rubber. If you are looking for a boot in this price range grab these but if you are looking for a nice or decent boot keep looking!
3,Just buy a regular notebook,"I mainly talked about being nauseous for the first three months and then ended up tossing the book, how boring to read for my child. I recommend buying a regular plain pages journal and writing as you feel inspired instead."
2,Please!!!!! Buck up Girlfriends!,"My mother had seven children and not once did she complain about these very minor inconviences.She had the last child when she was 42 years old. The only thing she ever did was cry a lot. If she had symptoms of morning sickness or anything else she never complained. Imagine your child having to hear how you had to""put your face on the cold tile in the bathroom after getting sick."" Not only does this insult me but women like my Mom who had multiple pregnancies and loved every minute of it. Get a life lady!"
1,Don't spend your money on this,"The tips the book gives for pregnant women are for women who don't really care about what is the best for the baby, but who do care how they look during pregnancy, and after it. The book for example doesn't really courage to breastfeed and advices to ask for an epidural the first thing you get in to the hospital. Said this, some of the book is funny though, even the tips that are not meant to be funny (like ""remember to apply make-up before leaving to the hospital"")... The book is like Cosmopolitan-magazine for pregnant women, it is easy to read but doesn't really tell even half of the real concept of being pregnant or becoming a parent."
1,"Sad, but True View of the American Way of Birth","The Girlfriends' Guides as well as the ""What to Expect.."" books are nothing more than a reflection of the current childbirth culture in America. Just watch shows like TLC's ""A Baby Story"" to see this in action. Unfortunately, childbirth has become a consumer-driven industry and American women don't want to feel any pain, don't want to get messy and want to be able schedule their births. This book simply reflects this prevailing attitude.For a more holistic, spiritual and empowering view, I recommend reading Ina May Gaskin's Guide to Childbirth, Jeannine Parvati Baker's ""Prenatal Yoga and Natural Childbirth"" and/or ""The Power of Pleasurable Childbirth"" by Laurie A. Morgan."
3,Canon in D,"I was under the impression that this was a solo piece...it isn't. It comes as two parts...for a duet. It will be good for me to learn, but wasn't quite what I was looking for."
2,inaccurate listing,"While the picture shows a non-grounded 2 prong plug, I received a grounded, 3 prong plug that wouldn't work in most of my outlets."
4,Timex watch,I had used this style of watch for years. When it finally died I wanted to get one just like it because it had all the features I used.
4,Really nice watch,"I got this watch recently at another seller but I really like this watch. I got it because I wanted a waterproof watch that could be used on formal occasions as well. This watch is good on any occasion. I've gotten several compliments on it. It's pros are that it is waterproof up to 30 meters, it goes with any style, and it's easy to slip on because it's stretchy. The cons are that it sometimes puts some weight on the wrist and can make it hurt, if you have hairy arms/hands it will pull on your hair, and it scratches sort of easily. I use it all the time at my swim practice and it's held up so far but I have to be careful because once it caught on the lane line and bent a bit cause it was stuck and I couldn't stop in time. Overall I'd highly recommend it."
3,it was alright,"well it worked fine, still does my only complaint is the band. I must have pulled it too hard and the thing ""broke"" apart. it was fine until then, won't get an expansion band again"
3,Too Small,"The watch works well, and delivery was super fast, however the face and the wrist band are both too small. I found it difficult to view the digital readout of the date, and other indications in the top half of the screen. Also the band is much too tight. It does not move on my wrist at all, and is therefore very uncomfortable. Clearly, these are not defects in the watch, but issues unique to the wearer (me). The next time I buy a watch on-line I will compare the face and band size to an older watch that I found better suited to me. I will probably give the watch to my grandson. Perhaps a smaller wrist and younger eyes will find it a better match."
2,Not what I expected,"This was advertised as a student edition; therefore, I purchased it for my child. When it came, it was a teachers edition. Not happy about the confusion."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I have been working with this book for several years. I have never been able to anything more than the modeling tutorials. The scripts do not function, therefore the UI's do not work and you are unable to finish the book! Additionally, you are unable to contact the authors to obtain corrections. I have purchased every book that Michele Bousquet has published since 3D Studio Dos 1. This book is not her best effort. Great idea to take a student from start to finish on a project but there-in lies the rub, a student nor could most instructors use this book for a reference must less a book to use for classroom instruction. Wasted time and wasted money.............."
3,Mastering the Art of Production with 3ds max4 by Jason Busby,"In a word, this book did not impress me at all.Before I bought and read this book, I had had a great expectation of the book because it had such high (all five stars) ratings.My expectation quickly waned as I read the book chapters by chapters.For me (in between a beginner and intermediate), the book was not easy to follow.I think that the 3d max quick visual start was a lot better book for me to learn 3d max.Finally, I would like to suggest you to check with this book at a bookstore before you decide to buy it (to save you time and money). Hope that my feedback would be of any elp to you."
5,Best all around 3ds max book you can buy,I have been searching for a book like this since I started learning 3ds max. It is hands down the best book I have purchased. It explains each part of a project from negociating a contract to each step of the production. I still can't believe how they could cram so much good information in so few pages (about 600). 100% recommended.
5,Love it,Great clear simple headset. Love the car charger and little carrier slip with clip. Awesome price!
1,Defective out of the Box,The Headset won't hold a charge. Battery was unchargeable. Accessory one wouldn't take it back. I had to file a claim. DONT BUY FROM ACCESSORY ONE!
4,Blue tooth review,"It works well, but seems to run out of juice quickly. I like the auto charger that came with it, rather than batteries, so quite convenient. Not the most comfortable for the ear, but it works just fine for someone like me, who is an infrequent user."
1,not worth it,i have brought many bluetooths in my life time and this is by far the worst. I love plantronics but they dropped the ball on this one. It's not so much as the sound quality as it is the design. The sound quality is very good but the earbuds come off very easily. If your charging it in the lighter holder and and graze it just a little the bud falls off. I can't tell you how many times I've had to pull over and look for the bud. It looks nice but not worth the hassel.
4,A valuable asset to anyone working with at risk youth!,"The Equip Program is easy to follow and provides great pointers to the people conducting the ""meetings."" This program helps promote positive change in youths through common sense and common language. The ""meetings"" are easy to implement and the lessons that are learned will help foster positive and productive decision making for a life-time!"
2,Succeeds at nothing,"Let's face it. Most who watch a movie like this are either hoping for some good sex and gore and can laugh at the plot, or are hoping for a good movie despite the sex and gore. This one succeeds at neither. It is a quality film, shot with more expertise than is typical of the genre but takes itself a little too seriously. The theme of men having all the power in the 1400s is beaten into the viewer continuously to the point where you wish someone could actually hear you when you say I get it already. I would disagree on the attractiveness of women in the 7os as a few reviewers noted hairy armpits and such. They didn't have Barbie wannabees back then. Unfortunately the few scenes that actually do show nudity are far from erotic. If you are an ultra-feminist, and don't mind having your own point of view pointed out non-stop then this is the movie for you."
5,The Mahayana view is all right here,"This is an easy-to-read and engaging explanation of the Mahayana take on Early Buddhism. It combines the latest historical research on early Buddhist councils and philosophical developments with the traditional Tibetan explanations in a surprisingly seamless way. It has none of the ideologically driven, debilitating flaws ofSoka Gakkai's History of Buddhism series. In short, it's a credit to the Tibetan Buddhist community and belongs in the home of both Tibetan families and historians."
3,A surprise and well worth reading.,'And Sleep Until Noon' is one of only two novels which Gene Lees wrote. He was an excellent essayist mostly about jazz and the people who were a part of that world. His novel about a white jazz musician is surprising in how he avoids the cliches one might expect. It is absorbing and the story held my interest as he uses his skills to keep you guessing. The ending is a surprise and I truly enjoyed reading it.Pilgarlic (look in the dictionary)(aka)Bruce Hart.
1,Opened package and insufficient weight,"The package of Nutmeg arrived not from this vendor but a 3rd party vendor. The package came in an unmarked open plastic bag and the weight of the product was not 1 lb. Since this is a food item it can not be used and has to be considered tampered with. The price is reasonable, but at the moment the product can not be used. I will not buy anything else from this vendor until this issue is resolved. I will try to get my money refunded or an untampered and properly labeled product as a replacement. This just arrived today and I can not use this for catering as it violates servsafe rules regarding the use of unmarked product."
4,Fun!,Good game. Easy to follow. Recommend for women going through menopause. Fun!More players = more fun! Seems like it would be a fun drinking game.
4,Salivating for the Dog,"I had been searching the local record shops for this album ever since CD's were available to no avail. When a friend suggested Amazon, my search was ended. A great melodic rock album debut that could have given Suprtramp a run for it's money if there was a little more commerciality to it. Regardless, fans of great music will appreciate this gem. I loved all the tracks on this album but especially ""Julia"" and ""Of Once and Future Kings"" are standouts. If you like this album, definitely check out their second disc, At The Sound of The Bell."
4,I salivated and it does the trick,"I remember this album from my college days (ABC Dunhill, if I recall) and it is sort of a little ""guilty pleasure"" treasure - I enjoy the high vocals and the pomposity, although I was never a fan later of Rush or Journey's Perry. It is meshed blend of prog and old fashioned 70s ""classic"" rock. I enjoy it.The band's sound is quirky and this album was put out at the first blush of the punk movement ...punk menial it is not. It is ""middle america"" prog.The bonus tracks are lo-fi samplings of the band live. They are poorly recorded and somehow endearing, although they would not be on any iPod playlist. The record overall is well remastered. Love went into the project.Packaging is well done - I am glad I picked it up before it goes out of print."
4,Nice Doggie...,"First of all,let me say that this is one great CD.I first bought this record in 1975 when it first came out.Every song stand out on this CD.The sound quality is good,but the only drawback I see is the cover.It looks like it was Xeroxed or something...A sticker on the CD wrapper claims it was re-released in 2007,but I have my doubts..On the CD itself,it says Made in Australia...It also says Columbia,Sony Music,and CBS records on the cover,but dispite all this it is still a bargain due to the sound quality and low price for this hard to find CD..."
4,SO DIFFERENT...,"My husband had this album on LP - it is quite old actually and I liked the singer's voice so much that I wanted to have it on CD for the car. My favorite ever is ""Julia"", this song will never age..."
3,RELAX MAX,"PAVLOV'S DOG MUSIC IS A RELAXING MUSIC; I GET MEDITATED WITH IT WHENEVER I FEEL STRESSED OR WHENEVER I LOOSE CONFIDENCE IN A HUMAN BEING. I LISTENED TO THIS 14 YRS AGO AND IT STILL SOUNDS IN BRAIN. MANY TIMES I GET A FLASH AS THE SOUND OF A BELL AND IT SIMPLY MEANS: U NEED TO PLAY THE MUSIC FROM PAVLOV'S DOG. IT'S A POSITIVE VIBRATION, A MEDITATING FLASH AND SUCH A GOOD THERAPY TOWARDS RELAX MAX"
3,Not Too Good,"Well, this movie could have been better. I think they really over did it with the clothing! I think the Olsens also wore way too much make-up, in some parts I think they hardly looked like humans! I liked the acting the Olsens did. I also liked the Luna-Park part. The bridge climb part was also wery good."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I waited a really long time to see this, ever since the day it came out.I sort of waited for nothing.For starters, I was glad to see that the plot went somewhere. (Unlike Switching Goals, which ended when it started.) And the girls had great hair, great clothes, and the guys were HOT!But it was hard to tell the difference between reality and dreams in the beginning. Also, what sort of stupid criminal would steal a rare diamond in the middle of the day? And super-charged ketchup? Puh-leeze. Another problem with the Olsen movies is that they are pretty far from reality. I mean, I know it's nice to imagine amazing things happening to you, but they go a little too far.It's pretty good, and I recommend it for any Olsen fan.P.S. I was a little disappointed they didn't kiss in the end, too."
1,Proof that Adults Hate Kids,"What psycho would want to subject their innocent child to such pathetic garbage? These two hobbits were merely annoying when they were on T.V. but they are downright toxic in this dreck. How about subjecting your kids to a real film like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or even ""Kiki's Delivery Service""? Don't insult your brood by forcing them to sit through this mess!"
3,Not bad for a Olsen-twins movie...,I'm used to seeing the olsen twins in movies with only 1 parent and trying to fix them up or they go to a far away place like Paris. But Our Lips Are Sealed has a pretty good and original storyline. It's about 2 sisters who witness a crime and is sent to different places with new identities. The last place they reach is Australia. Along the way they deal with popularity and boys and there are a few surprises! A real good movie for Mary Kate and Ashley fans or any younger teen!
1,Seriously?,"So I'll never get that hour or so of my life back. I loved the movie New York Minute so I thought this would be somewhere near as good. Unfortunately I was seriously wrong. The plot was ridiculous and the ad libing by the characters even more so. I can't believe I sat through the entire movie. I kept thinking it has to get better, it can't get any more stupid and every time I was proven wrong. Unless you're really into dumb comedy this movie is a complete waste of time."
3,My Lips Aren't Sealed for my Opinion!,"Last night, I rented ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" just for kicks.Watching it, it's...okay...Cute for kids under 12 years old.But on the other hand, it was very unrealistic and silly. Most of the adults acted sillier than the kids.Movies like that belong straight to video. That's why their other movie, ""New York Minute,"" wasn't successful, in the box office.However, that's just my opinion. I guess I'm more of a serious person."
4,A good movie for kids.,"I ordered this movie being a previous fan of the Olsen twins and wanting to see what they had become, overall this was a fairly good movie, but they way they portray Australia is TERRIBLE! I live in Australia, I'm sorry we do not have pet Kangaroo's and we do not talk like that....also vegemite doesn't look like that..and no not all Australians like it. But dispite this it is a good movie for children ranging from about 8-11, and it has a interesting storyline that will keep children watching. If you are a fan of the Olsen twins, I would say this is quite a good video to get."
3,Change of heart!,"Through time, I've developed a strong liking to this movie. It's in my top 5 Olsen movies. I don't know why I gave it a so-so review back in 2000. I guess it has really grown on me the past few years."
4,SHHH!,"""Our Lips Are Sealed"" is my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen film.The twins witness a crime involving a stolen jewel and are in the Witness Protection Program. They change their identities about 4 million times before being sent on the last place of earth: Australia! The fact that they filmed on location gave you a nice scenery of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Of course, they meet two surfer rebel guys and a snobby girl, Victoria. There is slight, yet tasteful, bathroom humor and they actually have TWO parents.Two goons working for the head of an Eastern European Mobster find them in Sydney and attempt to find the diamond, the twins prove that they're smarter and catch the REAL bad guy (goon from an imaginary country called Urugli) and save the day! Predictable, bubbly and a great family film; the essential mixture for a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie."
5,Great Movie,this is a pretty good movie. The olsen twins did it again in this fun film about two girls who witness a crime and hve to be in the witness protection program. but the big thing is that they can't keep thier mouths shut. This movie is awesome.If you have not seen this movie then i recommedn you do.
4,Olsen Twins Seal the Deal,"This movie was pretty good. It was slightly more nuanced than Passport to Paris. Craig Shapiro clearly has a more artistic partiality than Alan Metter. However, my friends and I were disappointed to see that SPOILER the girls do not kiss their boyfriends in the movie. This makes us lose faith in true love and believe that we will die alone. A great overall effort though. The girls are great actors and they have great outfits. I liked the distinction between the characters."
5,brilliant olsen movie,"i thought our lips are sealed was a great movie. it's suitable for old fuddy-duddies as well as young teens and kids. i watched it with my little sister and we both thought it was ace. plus pete and avery , but mostly pete, were absolutely gorgeous. i think i'll watch it again. brilliant."
2,Stupid,This was the dumbest Mk and Ashley movie I have ever seen. The plot moves on quickly and is complety un-realistic.
1,Our lips are sealed,The movie was good but some parts were unrealistic. Like even if Mary-kate and Ashley did stop theives from stealing a jewel they would try hard to keep it a secret. They wouldn't keep making mistakes and telling everyone that they stopped robbers until they got to Australia.
2,Too narrow for rolling pie crust,I rarely use my marble pastry board. It's long enough but not wide enough for rolling out piecrust dough.
4,SLICE OF SCI-FI LIFE,"OHANAPassages of action, some wry and broad-strokish, laid over the bare bones of a large-scaleconcept, an entire Nation island going into space rather than lose their heritage again,mixes with new-tech discoveries in the realm of cyberspace and hyperspace. Fools withphysics concepts,. community and mission-to-the-stars aspects. Very funny.Which means family in Hawaiian, apparently. Very interesting social-fi slice of futurelife."
1,Keep Looking...,"Upon reciept of this burner I attached the proper regulator and proceeded to light each burner and adjust the air mixer. The middle and far right burner had paint or some other black coating blocking 75% of the holes which I cleared out, these two burners only partially lit. The far left burner never functioned correctly it would not even attempt to remain lit. The frame on this cooker is ok, the burners are very poor quality, making it utterly useless. Pay a little more and get a different brand. I sent this one back and selected a Camp Chef which I have been happy with so far."
2,fragrance over powering,"Although this cream goes on well, the fragrance is too much. It diminishes over time, but too much time for me. My husband really disliked the smell too. I was disappointed. Didn't really use it long enough to see if it really works. Couldn't get past the smell."
5,Dopeness,"This c.d. is real, and although I don't think Crypt or Planetary are the best MC's out there I do believe they are consistently getting better. They've come a lot way since the JMT Presents mixtape, and this c.d. blows Blood & Ashes outta' the water. If you like JMT, AotP, or just dope music: Cop this c.d."
4,RAW HIP HOP,"This cd has about 5 songs that are must haves in a good hip hop collection. Especially track 10 with Royce 5'9""."
1,cover bands.,"The music is okay on this cd. But, its done by ""cover bands"" ,not the original artists so its not total package."
3,must have tiny arms to fit size small,"I am normally size 4-6 and wear a size S or even XS shirt, so I ordered size small. I expected the outfit to fit snugly, but I was only barely able to pull the shirt onto my arms and felt that if I moved at all that the shirt would tear at the arms or across the back. Except for lifting my young children, I don't think I am particularly muscular. So just beware that you must have really tiny upper arms (and back) in order to fit into size small. Otherwise, the outfit is really cute and decently made considering the price."
3,Good for students,"If you are a serious student of Old English, this tape is a must have. Spoken material is extremely hard to find, and Bessinger's diction is excellent. What would make this tape even more useful, would be printed, dual language translations of all the recitations. Somebody at Harper Collins should really think about this."
3,"Great Tape, but only a small fraction of Beowulf is here.","J.B. Bessinger's readings of Beowulf and selction of other Old English poetry is wonderful. However...this tape actually contains only about 15 percent of Beowulf, and only about 40 percent of ""The Dream of the Rood"". Still, what IS on the tape is just great."
3,No notes or translation provided,"One limitation of this recording is that no notes, transcription or translation is provided. Unless you already understand Old English, you'll find this recording euphonious but incomprehensible."
3,MEDIOCRE,This tape is mostly other Old-English (Anglo-Saxon) Poems The Beowulf is abridged by more than 70%. It only contains selected readings But still is read dramaticly with much enthusiasm which compensates for its incompletness. ....
2,Narrow!,"I have recently purchased two pairs of shoes by this company, and both were way too narrow! I don't have wide feet and have never had to were a wide width shoe in my life and my foot was hanging off the side. Otherwise, they are like wearing nothing. Great for someone with a small foot and or narrow ankles/heels."
4,Confused on age level,"The book was ok however, I wanted a book for older students. This is recommended for 6 th 8 year olds. The book is in an easy to read format and has breaks to complete exercises to practice what you learned."
5,Great helper.,"Has help me a lot by reviwing all the book with my kids, since is been a while since I was at school."
4,Great Starter Book,"This a great book for a child starting out learning some basic concepts of math formulas, it uses alot of visual's instead of numbers to teach some concepts, I would recommend for the young ones learning addition and subtraction."
2,Free Preview,Free preview is not helpful at all. Publisher should allow more pages for preview if he is really interested in selling this book.
2,Math + Magic = A Waste of Money,"This book promises a lot but delivers very little. The guy who originally sold them was a great salesman, Scott even got on Opera once. But after buying the book I don't see why. Very little of it was interesting or of value. However the books are poorly laid out, poorly explained and even worse are the illustrations. I bought them with high hopes to help my child with math. We tossed them aside after one quick read. If you need to learn or teach math get a Spectrum Book. These were nothing more then a waste of money. I always look and find something good about everyone and everything. I found a great use for these books. Not only do the pages line the bottom of a bird cage nicely, they also make great fire starters. Don't waste your money."
2,Book doesn't meet my needs,"I'm having a hard time finding a book to supplement riding lessons, and this just wasn't it for me. I found the diagrams somewhat difficult to understand; if anything, they seem to make the actions they're trying to explain more complicated than they are.Example: ""Right hand: Active, rotates at the wrist, fingernails facing up; acts slightly to the left in front of the withers. Left hand: Passive, goes forward and down to yield, to allow, and then to regulate the action of the right hand"" - it goes on like this to describe what the rider's right leg is supposed to do, and the left, and the seat, then gives the horse response broken down by nose, head, neck, shoulders, and haunches.All this is to describe the ""Indirect Rein of Opposition in Front of the Withers"". There are no photos, just stick diagrams w/lots of arrows and dotted lines. I'd recommend looking at this book in a bookstore or library before purchasing it."
2,"One ugly, impractical battery","It may have twice the capacity of the standard battery but it's also twice as thick and twice as heavy.Pros:1. Longer time between charges than the standard unitCons:1. Too fat, so any existing cases you may have your phone are not going to fit properly2. The replacement cover is needed due to its size; this is a cheap bit of plastic that doesn't fit my phone properly, leaving a small gap3. Converts the phone into a relatively small unit into a chunky monster that's noticably heavier in the pocketOverall, don't bother."
4,Excellent purchase,I really enjoyed the series. The experts team is awesome and some of the tasks are shocking. I will totally buy the next season!
3,Silly Bliss,"The work of Leroy Anderson embarrasses me because I don't want to be caught capering around a midnight room filled with the fancies I had as an unencumbered boy when I know I am no longer one.He was an OSS man, this Anderson, I believe -- a codester. What keener code than music to tap into my DNA anytime, anywhere, and yield feelings buried with the rainy days and sunny nights my imagination grew up with.This frees me up to play. I owe him for the joy."
5,old time elevator music,"guilty as charged, your honor. ok, i can admit it. i'm old enough to remember when this kind of music was all over the radio (look it up...) and in the background at nice restaurants.it's nostalgic for me and i like it. that's all..."
4,Excellent upbeat sounds,"I just now found out about Universal Robot Band. Dance and Shake Your Tambourine was the song I heard. A very catchy beat. I have discovered there are a lot of talented groups, which are not a part of mainstream music. This is definitely one of them. This group is definitely worth listening to. Some of the songs have different beats with a different style or genre. That is what makes this CD worth listening to. Good dance beats but not old outdated disco. I am definiyely going to check out more of Universal Robot Band CD's. I advise listening to this band and you will see what I mean.The Music Dude"
4,Classic Detroit Techno/Electro Sound,"James Pennington of Underground Resistance fame delivers his first solo album for Peacefrog, and mighty good it is too.It has all you have come to expect from Pennington, the rugged electronic beats of the motor city, Detroit, combined with beautiful string melodies.The emphasis is always on the more rugged side of techno/electro, but with the strings and basslines, it combines to be anything other than harsh. Equally at home on the home stereo or on the dancefloor, this is in my top 3 Peaecfrog releases of 2003."
4,Relative or Absolute?,"What do you think of God? or What should you think of that God should be? Is God absolute, or relative? Hartshorne shows how process theology articulates God. It is a good book to see Hartshorne's theology of God, and to get taste of process theology"
5,Superstar Son,"Joey has been an inspiration since he was a little boy. Just another star in his hat. Love you, Mom"
3,good general information--not much concern for organics,"This is the standard advice given by an author who is not that concerned with the environment. He uses and recommends too many chemical solutions to our gardening problems. However, I do own this book because it does give some expert advise on gardening in Texas, if you don't use his chemical approach. Good maintainance tips and schedules."
4,"Very good, even for a non-Jew","I'm not Jewish, but my wife is, and she suggested that I read this book. I must say that I am glad she did. What pleased me the most about ""Minyan"" was the way that Rami focused on spiritual principles and not dogma. I personally feel that there are spiritual truths that are manifest in all beliefs, and any book that shows how to incorporate those principles into daily life is a book that I find rewarding. This book is not only well written, but it offers practical suggestions for individuals seeking to foster spiritual development in their lives, regardless of religious affiliation."
2,not as expected,I got this set as a gift and used it once . There are so many scratches on the bowl because of tossing the salad which I did not think it will happen.
1,Extreamly disapointing and a BIG waste of money!,I felt these projects were poorly executed and generally bad looking. I would hate to spend the time wrapping a gift like some of these and actually give to someone. The book could have been soooo much better. Some of the written information was helpful but not enough to fork over the money for it.
1,amazon problem,"Amazon never sent it to me even though I waited for such a long time, I placed it twice but finally quited since Amazon never mailed it"
5,Best book I've read in years!,"Given to me as a birthday gift, this book sat on my shelf for eight years, untouched. Last week I decided to read something to send me to sleep, so I picked up this book, hoping it would drive me to fall asleep within fifteen minutes. But three hours later I was still reading it, with no intention of going to sleep anytime soon. It is a page turner. The author writes in a clear, simple, easy to understand and concise language that brings the reality of war right before your eyes. The book will horrify you, make you cry, and even make you laugh. Not only do we witness the sadness that wars bring to families and communities, but we also get to witness how those communities find ways to deal with it and carry on as normal people. You do no have to be Nigerian or ""Biafran"" to enjoy this book. I am neither and I enjoyed it tremendously. I very highly recommend this book. You will not regret reading it."
3,Pleasent fluff piece,"On a whole the story is entertaining so long as you can ignore some of the stereo types, (caveman husband, gay decorator, perky busybody and snob mother,""I may someday be able to accept you as a lesbian, but you must do something about those shoes"".)And an overly simplified story (""My best friend is a lesbian and those videos were amusing, oh my I am gay now"")"
1,two hours and $10 i'll never get back...,"i'm normally a fan of the indy gay film. i'm normally able to overlook bad acting and a mildly predictable storyline in the name of supporting queer visibility. i just couldn't do it with this film. the acting was so stiff it was painful. the storyline tried really hard to be funny and origional, but it failed miserably. the charicters were two dimentional and inauthentic, the plot was shallow and the jokes weren't funny. save your money."
1,"Why was this ""movie"" even made?","Who did they think would spend money to see this? It's kind of like a low-budget ""after-school special"" with amateur actors, something which might be shown in a progressive-minded high school to teach kids in backwater towns that homophobia is unpleasant. There is really no reason why any relatively intelligent being would want to suffer through this. Let's count the redeeming qualities: uh, that would be Zero. Go see ""Brokeback Mountain!"" Definitely watch ""The Opposite of Sex,"" watch ""Longtime Companion"" or ""It's My Party."" Even watch ""Philadelphia"" - but avoid this waste-of-time-in-a-box like the plague. (And no, it's not even bad enough to be funny.)"
2,Exaggerated and lacking...,"Here's one that will NOT be joining the ranks in my personal library of lesbian/gay films, which includes Desert Hearts, High Art, When Night is Falling, Bound, The Incredibly True Adventure..., Forbidden Love, The Crying Game to name a few. ""It's in the Water"" is rife with stereotypes, mostly with a tongue-in-cheek approach. Yet I found myself falling victim to my own stereotypes, because I never for one moment honestly believed the female leads in earnest. The men portrayed in the movie, even in their exaggerated-ness, were much truer to their identities. I'm sorry, but the one female lead (don't know her name) looks like Kathie Lee Gifford's twin. I know! lesbians can be glamorous, too, but I just couldn't buy into this one!"
4,A funny movie with some unexpected depth.,"This is a moving and well-made film about a young music student (Kevin Bishop) coming to terms with his sexuality, and his coming of age amid the world of professional music. Juliet Stevenson is brilliant as the boy's mother, who experiences an awakening of her own. It was filmed entirely in Barcelona with British actors, though most of the characters are American and the story takes place primarily in the US. A top-notch cast and production, augmented by an excellent musical score of classical music. This is a movie of subtle nuances and inevitable truths, and is not to be missed."
3,Good Film!,"Wow, I would have never thought that water would make you gay. In reality the movie isn't about being in the water at all. It's just that everyone drinks water, so everyone must be becoming gay. Interesting rumors and topic of discussion to choose. Hot stuff! My favorite part of the movie was when they kissed for the first time. Killer!"
2,Wait until it's on clearance,"...the gay men in this movie aren't portrayed well at all. They tried to appeal to both gay men and lesbians and didn't pull it off. They did little or no character development on any of the male actors. The acting ranges from fair (Alex) to very bad (Grace). The directing is poor at best. I found myself wanting to skip forward at times because I was bored to tears. And what's with Alex's mother? She was funny for about the first five minutes and then it got REAL stale. As a lesbian, I will add this to my library of DVDs, but I wish I had bought it off the clearance rack."
3,light comedic fare,This was ok...light on comedy light on love...and a little light on story line...worthwhile to see may want to rent first
1,GROAN,"Watch this with a gin and tonic you then need to get up and get another gin. Very disapointing rather dull movie. Bought this from previous reviews and what a waste of money, it neither well acted or funny and the story line is as weak as water."
3,Cheesey,"While I appreciate any and all lesbian movies, simply by virtue of the fact that there are so few of them, this certainly wouldn't fit into my Top 10 list. Cute but terribly corny and predictable. The dialog and acting leave much to be desired. I'm glad to have seen this ""classic"" lesbian flick, but there are much better movies out there: Fire, Lost and Delirious, The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love, Go Fish, Better Than Chocolate, among others."
2,Cure for Insomnia Found,"Feeble comedy features an implausible story about ""Gay panic"" in a small Southern town. With poor production values, flat acting, crummy camerawork and plenty of PC bludgeoning, _It's in the Water_ fails on nearly every level. Still, film-festival audiences lapped up this dreck, possibly because it portrays Straight people as complete morons and Gays as saints-in-training. I believe I may have chuckled once."
4,"Fun, cute...","This movie will never win any awards, but it's a low budget look at bigotry and intolerance with some decent jokes and one-liners. Acting is OK, actors are nice to look at. Go in knowing it's a ""poke fun, anything's possible, low budget look into gay life"" and I think you'll enjoy it."
3,This movie was okay,"I really didn't get much from this movie, but it could be one of those that you need to watch more than once to get everything from it."
3,Well. . .,"pretty dated but sweet. not something I would watch again, but my friends were visiting and we wanted something new. They had seen this and liked it - both of them are fairly conservative and bashful about nudity."
3,It's In The Water,This was okay but many are much better and I do enjoy your movies and books very much and plan to order more
3,What a fun film!,"I really enjoyed watching this film. The production quality isn't bad, the acting decent, and it actually had a plot. Many gay and lesbian films seem to be lacking all three! I enjoyed the storyline of how coming out in a small town effects your life and the people around you. Also how misinformation can lead to stupid actions and the way it takes a shot at the ex-gay movement. I would recommend seeing this movie with some friends and enjoying the evening."
5,Is it in the Water?,"This is an excellent movie to share on movie night with friends. The movie set in a small Texas town is full of wonderful, interesting people. The characters, although exagerated in some cases,(this is a spoof) make for an interesting ride into the world of prejudice, irrational thinking,or being a hypocrite. Well, worth watching...Keri Jo Chapman and Teresa Garrett are hot."
1,Really boring one,"I decided to watch this one because of all the positive reactions I saw here. But the movie fails.The concept seemed to be quite interesting, but the product doesn't deliver anything. There no chemistry between characters in this film, some of the actors play as if it was their very first time in front of camera, the others played on my nerves.There is not so many films with gay AND les plot, but this one is really dreadful.Don't lose money on that one."
4,Somewhat Condescending,"The premise is cute - a rumor that the water was making people gay. However, setting the scene with ultra stereo-typed 'straight' homophobes pitted against an AIDS hospice was just in bad taste. All the gays in this film are the extended maximum stereotypes as well, making the entire cast look insensitive, stupid and annoying. To add to the distate, it takes place in Texas (well, maybe that part did make sense). The characters are all stupid, annoying and two-dimensional. I feel like I wasted my time just writing this review."
2,Adequate... since there isn't much else.,"By my way of thinking, there are three ways to look at it.The first - it's great for a genre that rarely gets the funding to produce anything at all, much less something this inventive.The second - compared to movies outside its genre, it's poorly written, poorly acted and poorly filmed. Hate to say it, but it's true.The third (and probably the most reaslistic) - it's an endearing enough idea that could have been better had the budget been there to hire someone to write a better script to be performed by better actors (perhaps some who are actually gay instead of beautiful straight women who seem more like they're experimenting than actually coming to terms with their sexual orientation). As it is, there was no budget, so some of the better actors overcome the dialogue that isn't so great, making this a fine and somewhat enjoyable way to kill a few hours just before bed. At least they tried, huh?"
3,Eh...,"It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. There were too many of the usual stereotypes and it tried to tackle too many issues for such a short run-time, but it had a few moments of humor and there's a scene at the very end that's rather effective. I had to watch it twice, but I can admit to mildly appreciating it."
4,Great Movie!,"It was nice to see a funny movies with a ""gay"" twist! Not only that but the leading ladies were ""very attractive"" and not your stereo type ""Butch"" as in some flicks. The kissing was very sensual... only complaint... there could have been more of it!"
1,don't waste your money,I read the prior reviews. I think some were 'planted' by the producer to get more money because this movie is just flat out bad. It's like porn stars trying to act with words.Save your money folks...or donate to a local acting club in order to support some of these people.
4,Love it! so cute! but $10 more than Target Store,"Bought this for our newborn son. It is $20 @ Target.com but totally out of stock. found this for $30 on Amazon and bought it. I like the clear mid section which allows light to shine through. Monkey pattern are nicely stitched on fabrics on the clear plastic part, not printed on. Love the good quality. Also, its height is 70 inches which is hard to find. I have an older home from the 1940s and the curtain rod wall holders are set low ( guess it must be popular back then ). Standard 72 inches curtain will be dragging on floor. I am very happy to find something fit well and super cute! P.S. I found one later in Target store for $20 one week later. I didnt bother to return this because of shipping cost."
5,"Music Is Great! Buy CD, get booklet with pics & inside info. R.I.P. Mike.",He's gone way too soon but he's left us some GREAT songs.Buying the physical CD gets you the photos & background Info that makes listening even more enjoyable.
3,"Nice, but power supply is large",The drive is reasonably quiet and works well as a backup device. But the power supply is very large.
1,"Good Product, poor support","I'm happy with the speed and reliablity of the drive, however I wanted to make it bootable. I exchanged several email's with them and they eventually told me to ""go find a free one on the Internet"". I can't believe that they don't know how to make there own drive bootable, or even point me to a specific place to download a tool that would.When I bought an HP USB key drive they had a small tool I could run to make the drive bootable, supplied by HP. If I can't make it bootable using format, sys.exe or any other normal means, I expect the company to provide a tool for me. I don't think that's asking too much. Poor customer service and support."
1,"Bad deal, Good Hand Warmer","I have a client running 8 of these drives by La Cie and they have replaced 6 of them within 1 year of purchase. They are not designed to be left running 24/7 because they overheat. My client has lost years worth of data due to the failure rate. What's with using Firewire still anyway? Get a FN clue La Cie and put a fan inside and lose the firewire, fricken MAC lovers."
1,Very unreliable,"After about an hour of use, this hard drive just stops communicating with the computer. Information can't be stored or retrieved. Turning it off and then on again sometimes helps, but not for long. Turning it off for longer (> 1 hour) does allow it to be used again, but only temporarily.After trying everything I could think of to get it to work consistently, I returned it for a replacement. The replacement behaved exactly the same, which indicates this is probably a design flaw, rather than a defective unit.(I'm using a Compaq PC with XP, and have had no trouble with other USB2.0 externals.)"
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"I've never taken the time to write a review, but since I've given this thing so much of a chance to prove itself that now I can't return it, the least I can do is try to save someone else some grief.Like all the other reviews...it work wells for a day or so. Then it starts unmounting during file transfers. It skips when playing songs off it with iTunes. Some files even vanished and then reappeared days later! All this happens during the rare times I am able to get the thing to actually mount. Hopefully I'll get one more mount out of it so i can transfer my data when I buy my next non-LaCie external hard drive!DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!"
5,3 years of consistent reliability,"This drive has been very reliable for me. I have been using it to back up large directory structures from my file system at least weekly for more than 3 years. I bought the 250GB model for additional capacity, and have had the same reliable experience with that one, too."
4,so far so good,"bought my lacie drive 1 month ago as a slave drive for my apple ibook. so far, it works pretty good. the speed is a bit slow though. its only good as a backup. it took me 5 minutes to get it running after receiving it."
1,don't buy LaCie hard drives - they will die young,"I bought a 60 GB LaCie Pocket Drive USB2/Firewire drive in August 2003, for $349.95 from Microwarehouse. Died December 2004, 3 months after manufacturers warranty ended.Customer service was unhelpful, told me that there are only 4 manufacturers out there, and all have the same warranty. So I'm out $350.00.My company also bought a LaCie d2 FireWire , 80 GB (300656) Hard Drive, which died after 3 months."
2,Horrible Problems,I had horrible problems with this hard drive. It worked for all of 2 days. I must say that the customer service with lacie was great though and that I believe that I got a bad hard drive to begin with.
1,Plastic Paperweight,"Lacie has a real quality control issue on their hands. The disk worked for a week but failed just as David Sawyers' review mentions. Lacie technical support was gracious enough to send me a new drive (this was after they attempted to fix my original drive).The new disk, like the old one, worked for a week and then failed again. Now I have an ugly plastic paperweight and am short quite a lot of shipping money.It seems like there are some people who are quite happy with their drives but the question is, are you willing to bet your money on buying a subpar disk that has a high probability of failing?"
1,UNIT HAS DIED!,I've had this drive for several months and was happy with it until I disconnected the unit while I was away for one week...since my return the PC (Wind. XP) does not recognize the drive...and no sound (hard drive spin) is coming from it. LaCie website indicates the unit can be shipped back to them for repair HOWEVER all data will be lost!!!!
5,No problems,"I have been very pleased with this drive. I owne a Dell 8100 notebook it was a plug and play. I see others have had problems with this drive. I have not. Though I do only use it for holding music. I play it often and on random play doubt makes a difference but it has never overheated,locked up or the likes. I also have been able to hook up multi ports without haveing to turn it off. I would think that was a computer flaw not a drive flaw in loseing connectivity but Im no computer tech. I recomend this drive."
5,Exactly what was promised,"Plug it in, instant fast 160GB hard drive with very low footprint.I have had LaCie Monitor for two years with no problems. Products are very high quality and perform above average. Would definitely buy again.Update 1/07Still working in background as nightly back-up drive. No problems."
1,powersupply died just after 1 year warrenty,Was working ok for 1 year (well USB is slower then Firewire anyway) but then powersupply died. Opened case and found that Western Digital HD still works. Have to buy new enclosure and fix myself as repairing costs would be too high.
4,The War Diary of Helmut Lipfert,"A pleasant surprise for a translation from German!Lipfert, who died in the early '90's, wrote an engaging little memoir. Despite publisher's claims, you'll find little about Hartmann, Barkhorn, or Steinhoff; you will, however, get a new appreciation for the skill of Lipfert's opponents, the Soviet airmen.Like all of the German memoirs, there is little technical information in the book--if you don't know much about the Bf109 now, you won't know much more when you finish Lipfert's book.I risked blowing $25 on yet another disappointing book, but I rate it more highly than ""The First and the Last;"" ""Life and Death of the Luftwaffe;"" ""The Final Hours;"" ""I Flew for the Fuhrer;"" ""I Fought You From the Skies; ""Heaven Next Stop;"" and perhaps even more highly than ""Stuka Pilot."""
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent book. If you want first hand account of how it was over the eastern front, then read this book. Too bad the book ends on April 17, 1945. I would like to know what happened to the author at the conclusion of the war and afterward."
5,The March King,"This is a select collection of Henry Fillmore's most played marches. I believe he wrote over 200 marches, so many that his publisher told him to write under different names so that people wouldn't pass over his new compositions as duplicates or just another Fillmore march.This is a very enjoyable collection to listen to, although it is the only recording of his marches I could find. Perhaps some recording company could take up the cause and record more of Henry Fillmore's marches. They are a real good slice of Americana by a native Ohioan American."
1,Photo incorrect,"The. Photo is misleading. These aren the ""old"" silver wrapper condoms, these are the new blue wrapper condoms which feel NOTHING like the old ones. They feel like the super thick cheepos you'd get in a restroom. Absolutely horrible. The silver wrapper ones are unfortunately discontinued. Too expensive to ship back."
4,picks in a bag,"giving 4 stars because while i did recieve these 12 picks quickly, they were not in a box at all, just a baggy with a fender tag stapled to them. if i were buying them for me that wouldn't be a big deal at all but i wasn't,they are for a gift... not much presentation in a baggie with a stapled lable..... but they'll still be a good stocking stuffer....that being said they did send a 10% off card with them and a catalog from their (seller's) website.over all; satisfied, just don't expect the box in the picture."
4,Meets Expectations,"I got this pick and it has really been everything I wanted it to be. I like the heavy picks because you can use them on the guitar for a nice clear almost ringy tone and you can take it and use it on the bass too. Also, the Fender 351, well it's a classic shape and it's pretty easy to hold."
3,Comfortable - but not enough padding.,"The gloves are high quality. They are all leather & the wrist wraps offer additional protection. Initially, I was very satisfied with the quality and comfort. The issues that I do have with the gloves are that they fit snug, so there is no room for wraps. Additionally, there simply is not enough padding if you plan on doing a lot of heavy bag work or mits. They left my knuckles pretty bruised. I ended-up having to purchase new gloves with more padding."
5,Great glove; good wrist support,"Great bag and kickboxing class glove - esp. good wrist wraps! I had problems with wrist support in traditional gloves and these do great, even when my form isn't perfect. Also love the fact that the fingers are open, it keeps my hands from getting so hot. They do seem to run small; I am abt 5 1/2 feet and small/medium frame and I needed a large - do a search for the harbinger sizing chart before ordering and measure - if you are right on the line btwn two sizes, order larger vs. smaller. Love these gloves!"
1,never able to use,"When I ordered the product, I kept putting on my order for a medium size. When the final paperwork was sent for delivery, it said it was being shipped and it was a small. A small was sent, instead of a med., thereforewe could not use the product. If you can take care of this matter, with a return ticket for the small one, we would appreciate it."
5,Great quality,"I love how much support this glove gives my wrist. I use them for a kickboxing class that uses bags. My knuckles aren't getting bruised or bloody anymore which is nice. The first time I put the gloves on they were tight, but they stretch with time. I have extremely small hands for an adult, so I'm kind of sad that they got a little bigger (the description on their sight said they would so I wasn't surprised). This is the smallest glove I have been able to find, I have a size 4 or 4 1/2 ring size and I wish they had an x-small. The small is ok, though. All-in-all a great product, wish they made it in youth size. :)"
3,Not enough padding in the knuckles for solid punching. My hands are totally bruised.,"On the up side, they breathe well and are flexible. Unfortunately, for me they do not give enough protection. I like to really punish the bag. I kickbox about 4 days a week. These gloves are not padded enough to protect my hands and they fit snuggly so there is no room for wraps. My advice would be to buy them a size too big so you can use wraps if you want to be able to really slam your punches."
5,Excellent product,"I truly love these gloves. I have been wearing them for over a year now, doing at least three workouts per week, and they are holding up quite nicely. They are comfortable, easy to put on and take off and do the job they were meant to do. I use them in my kick-boxing classes. There are three other women in our group and all use this particular glove and all are quite happy with it. I would suggest, as another reviewer has already mentioned, that you go to the Harbinger website to get the information on the proper fit before you buy. These do run a bit small, but with the measuring information at Harbinger, there should be no problem. The cost on these is well worth it. I highly recommend these gloves."
4,Great gloves!,The wristwraps are great. They truly protect your hands when hitting the punching bag. I strongly recommend them.
5,Fridge packs rule!,"I won't bore you to tears with a review of Diet Coke as a beverage. Its good - 'nuff said. I would like to comment on these ""fridge packs"" though. In my opinion these are the greatest thing to come along since the aluminum soda can. Here is what I like about them:1. Fridge packs slide right onto any shelf in your refrigerator and they take up very little room.2. This type of packaging not only provides an easy way to carry the sode home, but it allows you to store the soda ""at the ready"" without having to unload the box ahead of time.Try one of these packs, you'll like it!"
2,OK as a time piece but misleading title,"A nice enough flashback to life in the 50's, but I felt mislead by the title. The ""vampire"" action is only a couple of chapters at the end. This is barely a ""horror"" story, it's more of a coming-of-age of 3 friends, a la ""The Wonder Years"", but with 16-17yr olds."
4,One of Laymon's Best,"This is actually the first Richard Laymon book I had ever read and it was so good, I became a huge fan of his and worked hard at getting everything he's written. This book reminded me of The Body by Stephen King, a horror story but more importantly a coming of age story. While the vampires are really secondary in this book, the three main teenage chracters and all the stuff they go through to see ""The Travelling Vampire Show"" is where the great writing is. This book introduced me to Laymon and I quickly became a huge fan! Other favorites of his are After Midnight, Body Rides and Ressurection Dreams."
3,What happened?,"It's almost like the author said to himself ""Egads! I'm almost to page 500 I better end this soon!"" During the last 50 or so pages of the book the plot changes, the characters change, and we're hastily shown the ""This way to the Egress"" sign. But then, during the whole book the characters are pulling 180's ""I'm so worried about [insert name here], they could be in GRAVE danger!"", 2 minutes later, ""Let's go to the diner to get lunch!"" The main characters act like they're the 16 years old they're written as, right up until it's not convenient for them to be teenagers. This book leads off great but finally dissolves into a confusing mess that left this reader disappointed."
2,Could've been much better,"Luckily this isn't the first book I've read by this author, because it probably would've been my last. This book has very little to do with The Traveling Vampire Show, except for a tiny bit in the beginning, and then at the end. The rest of the time, the book meanders all over the place, following the characters around their town. It was quite a letdown and not at all what I'd thought the story would be like. I'd spend your money on another book."
5,The best book I've ever read!!!!,"I bought this book for the title alone, I'll admit. Never did I realize that it would become my favorite book of all time. Richard Laymon has a way with characters. The three teens in the book are completely believable. Simply put, I've never been more hooked on a novel than I was with The Traveling Vampire Show. I could not stop reading. I had to find out what happened to Dwight, Slim and Rusty. The only downside to the book was that I learned of Laymon's death while I was reading it, meaning that I will not be able to enjoy anything new from this amazing author. I'll be glad to re-read this book until the binding wears and the book falls apart. If you appreciate great characters, then you'll love this book."
1,Save Your Time and Money,"After all the good reviews, I decided to give this one a chance. Phew. What can I say? Laymon's characterizations are shallow as wallpaper, and the pace of the book is plodding in the extreme. The author piles on detail after mundane detail, often taking several sentences just to move one of his characters across a room--which would be fine, if something actually happened along the way. I also found his character's adolescent obsession with catching glimpses of women's bras and breasts embarrassing (for him, not for me). I agree with others here who have said that these kids seem more like 12 than 16. I persevered to the end, though, just to see where it was all going. Wish I could say it was worth the effort."
2,Disappointed,"I agree entirely with the other negative reviews on this novel. Stephen King is the master of combining coming of age with a good horror story and Richard Laymon has not challenged him at all. I found the story irritating and the plot twists were invariably a disappointment.If you want a good horror read do not buy this book, if you want coming of age read Catcher in the Rye."
2,Not Very Good,"The catchy title had me wanting to read this book for quite some time now. I hate to be hard on Laymon, but if there is a word I could use to describe this book it would be...weak. It could have been a lot better! The story kind of drags along with not too much happening. The ending had a little twist that made the book a little better, but in general was a little unrealistic. Not the best!"
1,It ain't Something Wicked This Way Comes,The back cover of the book faviorably compares this book to Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. That comparison is meaningless hype. Read the reviews listed here. Those who mention Bradbury's book do not like this book. Those who like this book do not mention Something Wicked.
2,children book,"I could never understand how people say this is his best book. If you are 13 and you like stories of little kids and teenage love and constant running around because of this worrying here and there then i understand. This book is not horror, nor exciting, nor gruesome like other laymon works and is simply a story of a few kids about a vampire show coming to town with a little bit of action and mild horror (literally two paragraphs) in the last 40 pages. It was ok to read, but it felt like a book i would read in 9-10th grade."
2,Ugh!,"Painful to read. I bought this on the suggestion of other readers here at Amazon. All 1 and 2 star reviewers have hit the nail on the head with their reviews, as far as i'm concerned. I won't rehash any of it, just read theirs. I will not be reading another book by this writer, but hey, now i know."
4,Horror? Not so much...but still a good book.,"You've read the synopsis - 3 friends want to see the Vampire show, etc. etc...It is indeed a coming of age novel, but definately Laymon style. The tale of these 3 friends is full of the teenage hornies and eerie mishaps, but it is pretty light on the horror and (for one of Laymon's books)light on the gore. The ending was a nice little twist and the story turned out to be nothing that I expected, not that that's a bad thing...I was a little disapointed but I have to admit it was still a good story. I think that it's a good book for someone who has never read Laymon before to cut their teeth on..."
4,Laymon remembers being a sex starved teen.,"First off, I will admit that I loved this book. It was very candid, and very true to the feelings of the 16 year old male. While I feel that the ""Traveling Vampire Show"" itself was almost a passing afterthought through most of the book, with an almost ridiculous final confrontation, I still enjoyed the book immensely. It was just plain old fun to read."
3,Doesn't live up to its promise,"I really like Richard Laymon -I think he's really talented, and he sure knows how to write a scary novel. And this is surely scary enough, but it somehow misses out on the great promise that it isthe relationship between the young main characters.The story is intelligent enough, and in fact the entire concept of the scary show, in the field of horrors, in a quiet town is the stuff of truly great horror. But this is more than that - it is a novel of friendship and the things that we can get ourselves into when we're not quite children, and not yet adults.Alas this really falls short. If you want to read a novel which develops these friendships in a far superior manner, you cannot go by Stephen King's ""It"". However, if you want a quick read, and a quick scare, then come visit the Travelling Vampire Show some time soon."
3,Too many unresolved issues,"The three main characters were extremely well developed, perhaps a tad OVER-developed with too many insignificant scenes. Unfortunately, there were several unresolved questions that made me feel cheated at the end. And the explanation that Bitsy ""simply disappeared"" was a total cop-out. And just how did teenage Slim (a girl) kill all those men with a small knife? It seems she is Wonder Woman's daughter. Beyond that, it seemed the author was simply playing out his sexual fantasies on paper. It bordered on perversion."
4,Subtle Horror/Suspense,"While I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as a Horror Novel, The Travelling Vampire Show is an excellent character novel with some genuinely eerie moments. The eerie moments are few and far between, and most is left up to your imagination, but the characters are so well written that I was never bored.The only drawback is the ending. It seemed over-the-top and comic-bookish. It's almost as if the author just wanted to get the book done to meet a deadline. I read the novel straight through in one sitting. Very good summer read."
2,"Author had a few ""issues""","First of all, I think Laymon had some talent. He did seem to have good characterizations. I am going to try more Laymon books. Now that I said that, Laymon probably never got any action in his lifetime and had to fantacize repeatedly about the complete absence of bras in his fantasy world. Like other reviews: characters were not 16, more like 12. Ending was a complete cop out. After all of the trauma these characters went through, everything seems to be all peachy keen for them in the end. More realisticly, none of the characters that made it to the end could have ever looked at each other again and they would all be in therapy for the rest of their lives. If Laymon had spent a little more time on the ending and a little less time fantacizing about nude or nearly nude women, this review would have been much higher."
5,A Laymon Fan For Years,"I might be biased since I've been a Laymon fan for years, but rarely does this author do wrong by me. TTVS is probably one of his best. Small towns. Kids who act like real kids. And you can't forget the vampire. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. How can you go wrong at this price? Give him a shot and you won't be sorry."
2,"Reading ""The Traveling Vampire Show"" is like . . .","watching Jerry Springer. You know it's oversensationalized, can't happen in real life and can't get much lower, but somehow you just can't stop watching (or turning the pages in this case). The story has a comic book plot, a rehashed ""vampire"" character that could easily have been Vampirella by the way Laymon described her, and way too many references to a certain part of her anatomy, yet the oversexed, dysfunctional, and prone-to-violence teenagers in this story lend it a certain charm. I would have given this book one more star if it weren't for the fact that Frances and Dwight survived; had they died grisly deaths this mediocre exercise in pulp fiction would have been so much more enjoyable."
4,"Scary, But Mostly in a Nice Way","This is the first Richard Laymon book I've read, but it definitely won't be the last. The Traveling Vampire Show is a coming of age story similar in scope to Stephen King's The Body, Robert McCammon's A Boy's Life, or - dare I say it? - Ray Bradbury's classic novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes.The novel follows the adventures of three best friends, all in the 16 year old range, who make it their summer goal to see The Traveling Vampire Show. Laymon occasionally lapses into the predictable (hence the 4/5 rating) and the ending left a little to be desired, but I still couldn't put this book down. Laymon's book will, more than likely, join that rare sect of books (maybe a dozen) that I re-read somewhere down the road - and that's one of the highest compliments I can give a book."
1,Not worth reading,This book is obviously written for 13 year old boys because their idea of plot development is a hard on. Not mature enough for adults and not appropriate for children. Also until the very end the plot was terrible.
4,Stake Well Done!,"Laymon takes the ""Bite"" out of the vampire novel with this one. However, I found the book a lot of fun to read (can't believe I'm saying this about a ""Horror"" novel). The ending will keep you turning the pages so fast that your fingertips will sizzle! Nobody writes like Laymon!"
3,A Little Goes a Long Way,"In some novels the prose is a joy to read and great detail gives realism. In some novels, less is more. This is a novel that would certainly benefit from some severe editing. While it has a great premise and the plot line is also good; the unending descriptions of totally boring and useless action make you wish you could cut to the chase. Most readers probably do just that and go to the end to read the last page, and therefore end their suffering. The sexuall scenes come off as totally unnecessary explotation and are forced sounding. It is also one of the most blatent Stephen King (...) I have ever read.In short, it has been done better, by better writers, many other times."
2,Disappointed...,"I just finished reading this book. My overall feeling for this novel is SLOPPY. There were some enjoyable scenes (the fight scenes with Valeria, Slim's character, a few others) but they did not redeem the overall story. The ending was very abrupt as if the author was headed to a long vacation and didn't want to be bothered with an unfinished novel. And what is the fixation on clothes and lack there of? I feel it should of been titled ""CLOTHES""! The vampire aspect of this book was a small ingredient. I cannot recommend this book. This is my first and last of Richard Laymon."
2,Disappointing,"I thought the premise was great but overall I was a disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, but the book seemed cartoonish, reminding of an R-rated Scooby episode, the ending notwithstanding. The story is original and Laymon does a good job depicting the rural 60's setting. The characters are interesting, but their actions are sometimes puzzling and not believable. At times the teenagers acted like 10-year-old kids. If you are a big fan of vampire novels I think you should read this, but otherwise I can't recommend it."
5,Another in a series of classics by Mr. Laymon,"Awesome book, like most of his others. Almost reads like an eposidic drama instead of a straightforward novel - which is a pleasant change of pace. As cliche as this sounds, I literally could not put this book down.Gets my highest recommendation! YOU WANT THIS BOOK!"
3,Pedantic....with some gore for your patience,"This was my first Laymon novel, and may or may not be my last. A 400 page story....its first 310 pages are about as slow and tedious and one could imagine. He does a great job with building the atmosphere and developing the characters...too good. Taking a paragraph to recite how a character takes off his shoes then gives them to another and then they put the shoes on...come on. Regardless, it gives him plenty of time to build the suspense and he gives us a few tense moments to keep us following. The climax is, of course, bloody and sexual...complete with nudity, rape, gore, and action. Fun stuff. The epilogue seems as though it was written in 30 seconds, with nearly no closure or emotive response to the happenings these young teens just went through. Very poor.A decent summer read at best...but don't expect too much. I suspect this was a taught and fun short story he had in his head, that he decided to stretch to novel length. Too bad."
2,should have been a short story,The story had too much filler in it. The author could have cut this down considerably and made a decent short story. The best part of the book is the last 20 or 30 pages. This was my first Laymon book and it will probably be my last. Try Brian Lumley for a series of truly terrifying vampire books.
4,A fresh surprise,I liked it. Maybe it's not the best I've read this season but it's a fast reading book quite entertaining and both innocent and wicked. A fresh surprise.
5,everything from a-z for writers,"This magazine is indispensable for anyone interested in writing.From articles about writing, to updates on markets, editors, agents, and what they are accepting or not, you cannot get a better magazine tailored for today writer. The world's leading source of writing instruction, inspiration and inside information for writers of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and scripts. Often will have a Storm Warning against publishers or agents that you need to be aware of. Also, including listings of Writers' Digest books available.This is a good way for writers to understand the commercial nature of the business, and keep abreast of fast moving changes in the publishing industry."
4,Red River - red in more ways than one,"The musical score of this 1949 John Wayne American classic has a great twist. Dmitri Toimkin is the composer, and it was played by the Moscow Symphony. (The lyrics to the original score were sung by the Moscow chorus, which is probably why it is hard to understand). Red river captured the classic cowboy cattle drive the way Dances with Wolves takes the viewer into an Indian buffalo hunt."
4,i luv this book,this book is pretty cool it definitly inspired the creation of another cuckold resource.I recommend this book[..].
4,the ffl,very suprised to though i had ordered a old 1928 book only to get a modern reprint that i can read.
3,Interesting twist for young readers,"Curse in Reverse is the story of a witch who could find ""no room at the inn"". Everywhere she went, she was turned away by people who did not ""like her kind"". She placed a curse on the owners of each of the places that sent her away. Finally a couple who could not have children of their own took her into their home. They gave up their bed and did everything within their means to make her comfortable. To return their kindness, the witch put a ""reverse curse"" upon the couple. For years, the couple did not understand the reverse curse and lived in fear of what might happen to them when the curse was complete. There is a twist at the end of this story which young children will find intriguing.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
2,Not That Great,When I got this product it did not meet my expectations. The one I got may have been defective but it did not fit or close over the Ipod correctly. Part of the screen wasn't visible and the case would be better designed if it came with a built in screen protector because using the one supplied made it even more difficult to make the case fit.
3,read the book,"You won't have a f++king clue what this movie is about if you did not read the book. I enjoyed this movie however (I have read the book 8 times) because of the accuracy of the visuals. The people and places in the movie are almost exactly how I pictured them. John Hurt and Richard Burton are excellent but again, you won't know why unless you have read the book. Did I mention that you need to read the book before attempting to view this movie?"
2,Why Change The Soundtrack?,"I was considering buying the DVD of this great film until I read some of the reviews. It's insane that the folks who produced it decided to remove a memorably surreal soundtrack for apparently no good reason. Considering it's a DVD (and not VHS), they could have at least been considerate enough to give people the option of choosing between the ""Original Soundtrack"" and ""Orchestral Soundtrack.""I'm going to hold off buying this for now, and hope that MGM will correct this error."
2,i don't like it,"didnt like ti, to heavy and wasnt intertained. To long story wish that is would end take it off i every watched ti"
1,This movie sucks.,"You can't make a good movie out of a ideological novel like 1984. Same problem with Lolita. The ""story"" is all you can show on the screen, and the ""story"" is secondary to the ideology. So when you try to film these books, all you get is confusing fluff.And the crossing the arms bit during the Two Minutes Hate? Please.I gave it one star, only because the program wouldn't let me post without it."
5,Art Imitating life or?,"Its a good book and this is the 2nd version movie that I have seen and I enjoyed both versions, both could be longer and include more details. The modern was good and believable stage settings, the older one was good but looked like sets."
5,A perfect example of HOW to go from book to film.,"A movie based on George Orwell's '1984'? No, the movie IS 1984! From the air of defeat in the bombed out streets and buildings most people would call 'ruins' to the characters played by such great actors as John Hurt and Richard Burton, Michael Radford REALLY brings the work of literature to the big screen. Filmed during the same time period as the events in the novel it is a story about freedoms, fears and love.Still, the book IS better.NOTE: Have now seen the DVD version. The music from Euryhmics has been removed, which would not be bad if it had been replaced by silence, but it was replaced by a soundtrack that is bland and feels almost lazy. Like an after thought. Book is still better."
3,I have to agree...,"Not that I am some fanatical Eurythmics fan...but the music is definately missing. It wouldn't be a big deal if they had replaced it with something equally dark and edgy as the original...but this soundtrack is just plain weak. It evokes very little and adds nothing. It took me a little while to figure out what was different, but it was obvious from the beginning that something wasnt right. It truly effects the overall impact of the movie and for some reason makes the editing very noticable. While it is still one of my all time favorite movies, this dvd version renders it sort of...limp. If you are viewing this movie for the first time, stick to the VHS version and I guarantee you will love this movie."
2,Missed opportunity,"1984 film 1984 has long been in need of remastering and re-release, but sadly MGM only did it half right. For one, the compositions are too tightly letterboxed wacking some nice visual info off the top of some shots. The biggie is that they chose to dump all of the Eurythmics contributions to the music score in favor of Dominic Muldowney's compositions. Both scores are nice, but the film has lost a great deal of the distinction that the Eurythmics tracks lent to it. Muldowney's score is servicable, and was well utilized in the patriotic anthems of Oceania, but the Eurythmics portions lent a haunting beauty to many scenes, and are woefuly missed. MGM could have released both scores on alternate tracks, but they cheaped out. Too bad."
2,does'nt work,"Hi, I recieved the dvd and tried to watch it and ""eject, this is not allowed in your region."" It seems i was sent a product that is only formatted for the UK> I would love to return it and recieve a dvd that would actually play. Please contact me concerning this.Thanks. I look forward to hearing from you. John."
2,Read the book,I read the book 1984 and then months bought the movie. I would highly suggest that you rent it before buying it. If I did I sure wouldnt't be writing this review and complaining to everyone how terrible they made the movie. They could have done such a better job with it. But I guess thats what you get when hollywood tries to make a movie from a book.
2,I was disappointed ...,I am a sci-fi nut and have an interest in dystopias ... but I must say I was disappointed with this movie. I really can dissect it enough but suffice it to say that I think it would be a bit hard to follow if you hadn't read the novel already. It is also a bit abstract at times. I am glad I saw it to satisfy my curiosity but I think I will put it up for sale. I thought THX-1138 was a better movie as well as the TV redition of Brave New World.
5,"Very good, great, but a few things could have been better","This movie was good, but without reading the book you would not understand it. Also, I think they could have found a better Big Brother. Overall, Very Good!"
4,Big brother is watching,"Excellent movie, Richard Burton and John Hurt delever top notchperformances, even though this movie is titled 1984, it is timeless, the sets are dark and moody, very reminisent of luftwaffa attacks in the WWII films that you see, In a day andage where our civil rights are being disolved in the name of homeland security, this film hits more close to home than ever."
4,Worth seeing; a faithful rendition,"Usually, science fiction novels that are translated into film usually have their themes altered to suit the filmmaker's own vision (e.g.,Lynch's DUNE). However, I feel this film breaks that sad tradition and actually moves both the plot points and the themes from page to screen. The acting is excellent all around (although I personally feel that Burton's portrayal of O'Brien, though more than competent, is a strange take on that character). This is well worth seeing."
5,1984 - are we there yet?,"This movie was really well done. I am almost always a fan of books over movies, but this was very well done. The cinematography is dark, but that is the mood throughout the movie. The actors were splendidly placed in the roles. Richard Burton's performance was darkly impressive as was John Hurt. Even if you like the books better than the film version, you should buy this movie. It is well worth the price."
3,DVD needs 2nd audio track option with Eurythmics,"I read the book and think this is a great film adaptation. This film is a timeless classic and I'd give the film itself 5 stars, but was very disapointed that the original soundtrack with the Eurythmics was missing."
4,"Okay, but the book is MUCH better","1984 is one of the best novels ever written, in my opinion. It's incredible. It hits you like no other novel I know.This movie version, however, was not the greatest. It was okay, but could've been a lot better. It just doesn't contain the same raw charge of doom and emotion and fear that the book did.That said, John Hurt was the best possible choice for Winston Smith. Hurt IS Winston Smith.Oh well, the book is so good that I'll still give this movie 4 stars."
3,"Creepy, scary, depressing.","Imagine a world where every aspect of your existence is dictated, and you are told to lie to give a better picture for whoever is running the government. Imagine your vocabulary is being dumbed down for the sake of expediency, and that sexual pleasure is forbidden.1984 is that depressing, and even though I thought it was an excellent film, I just couldn't get myself to watch it over and over again like I used to with a lot of films I really liked. There's a bit of ""hope"" given at the end, but it's like the circumstances given to these people are really so deep in the grey that you ever wonder if anything will change at all.Me, I prefer a comedy or an epic if I want to see drama. This film is pretty sadistic, and I'll leave it to you as to whether you want to chance it or not.Me? I actually own a copy, but I'm thinking it would do better as a library donation."
1,Dull and vulgar,"I would have given it no stars but you have to give at least one. It was dark, dull, vulgar, and I didn't care about any of the characters. I actually stopped trying to watch it after about forty minutes."
3,FUTURE PAST?,"A small but rising chorus of concerned voices in the U.S. suggest that in an age when we are eagerly surrendering our freedom for the illusion of more security, Big Brother may not be so far off.1984, Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's depressing premonition stars John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton as lovers who must keep their affair a secret. Richard Burton, in his final role, is a government agent who exposes Hurt to the concept of resistance.Oceania is a country that outlaws sex, fabricates reality and reconstructs history so it can suppress the masses, who are brainwashed via TV.Sound familiar? Orwell was off a little on his dates, but some of his ideas have been boldly mirrored ... An almost great film that deserves to be reconsidered because of it's timely and relevant ideas."
2,Read the Book!,"I'm sorry, but this movie does not do any justice to the power of the book 1984. If you don't read it and simply dive into this film, you will be lost, bored, and will not have seen an unforgetable and frightful parallel with modern society. Please, I beg you, read Orwell's original vision!"
2,Book was better,"I have read 1984 the book several times and I just finished watching the movie. In my opinion the movie left much to be desired. At least it didn't gang-rape the book -- it followed the plot and even the ending -- but the movie left too many things out and I get the impression that unless you've read the book you wouldn't be able to understand it. You can't really make a decent movie out of 1984 anyway. I do like the movie for being able to capture the setting of Oceania so well, though, that's why I give it two stars not one."
3,Cheap Production,"Seemed like a low budget movie but, really strikes the imagination about what society could and does become when big brother becomes too, big and powerful."
4,Fairly faithful rendering of the novel,While the storyline was not followed with obsessive compliance the digressions were few and in the context of the intent and feeling of Orwell's story were impactfully presented.
2,slow,"i read the book many years ago and loved it. somehow, it didn't do the same on film. in a word? depressing"
4,Best look at the near future of America,Wake up America . Its good for all to watch . It depicts the future with out rights . Illegal words . Illegal breeding .
1,another bore from England....,"Yes, I had seen this movie and, yes, I did a mistake thinking for ten bucks I couldnt go wrong. Boring! As I mentioned in other reviews all English movies are boring and this one is not exception. We basically see nothing except TV with some idiot on screen all the time which supposedly means something and as we suppose to know this movie is about communism and socialism and, well, whatever.Stay away unless you planning commit suicide. Stick with Tinto Brass and cheer up."
1,awful,this movie slaughtered one of the greatest pieces of modern literature. Everything from the acting to the scene was just miserable. DO NOT WATCH!
1,so stupid,"I read the book right before I watched the movie and I mean RIGHT BEFORE. I finished reading the book and then put the movie on like a half hour later. There are a number of really, really disgusting parts in this movie. The dialogue is really hackneyed. The book is good. This movie is just about a travesty."
3,Positively Orwellian,"An excellent transfer of this out of print classic, and a must have for anyone still hoarding a battered VHS version. Director Radford's straight forward approach to the adaptation of Orwell's novel comes across cleanly and vividly in the widescreen DVD format.A word of warning : In an incredibly Orwellian manipulation - any remaining vestige of the original Eurythmics film score [which had been severly edited for the theatrical release] has been eliminated. Extremely ironic in light of one of the underlying messages of the work ""Who contols the past controls the future,who controls the present controls the past."" The absence of the Eurythmics score ultimately deflates the scenes they had been initially included in - which now have no underscore at all."
1,"Awesome movie, but ruined by the removal of the Eurythmics","I was so excited about getting this movie on DVD that I sold my VHS version (in retrospect a terrible mistake) as soon as I heard it was going to be released on DVD. The movie is a wonderful movie and timely as ever. The video transfer to the DVD medium looks very good. However, and this infuriates me, the soundtrack of the Eurythmics which complemented the orchestral soundtrack and the visuals of the movie is completely missing!!If you are going to put out a DVD, do it right and don't butcher it!! The DVD is ruined in my opinion. For those of you who have this on VHS and plan on getting the DVD version, you should hang onto your VHS copy if you enjoy the TRUE soundtrack."
2,"Read the book, then don't bother with the movie","George Orwell's powerful book on a bleak future just does not translate well to the screen. At least not in this adaptation. In fact, if you haven't read the book I doubt you'll have any idea what it's all about other than a really unpleasant society. Of course, 1984 is no longer a future date, but time seems to have passed this by."
1,"Region 2 in South America, we live in N. America!","Amazon or its contracted provider should have pop - ups to point out that this movie only works in Region 2 part of the world which most people do not know means it only works on audio/visual televisions and/or movie systems in SOUTH AMERICA. Since I have a buyer profile with amazon . com and my billing, shipping addresses ARE NOT in S. America but rather North America... i feel it would have been helpful if a ""pop up"" window would have come up stating "" are you sure you want to purchase this movie as I see you reside in USA Region and this movie will only work in Region 2 S. America???"""
1,1984,"When I received the DVD, I couldn't get it to play on any of my 3 DVD players.A message came up that said unable to play in this region. I thought that wasweird.So, I contacted the supplier, and they said ""This item is region 2 (you can see this in the item title)."" ""It can only beplayed on an all region player."" I wonder why they would sell such a DVD in the USA, if it doesn't use any devices we sell here.I have never come across that in all of my 72 years. Even if I had seen this, I still wouldn't have know what it meant??I hope they will give me satisfaction. I am waiting for some kind of exchange or something?"
4,Great Buy,This product came in very good condition and was just in time for a birthday present. Thank you!
3,"Read the book first, then compare it to this","I've enjoyed reading the novel. It was such a great story. Although, it brings kind of depression into the mind of the reader, it would kind of affect one's thinking when comparing what the writer thought during the 50s and looking back at our days now. The movie is faithful to the novel, except I expected more living backgrounds and scenery. I mean, I'd expected more like ""brazil"" than this one. The music is good, but could have been better if done in Dutch as to bring the taste of WWII into this. Well acted, but I didn't like the actress(forgot her name) since she could have lived her role better than this. The movie is not long, though its very precise and there's not one minute wasted on nothing. I'd expected more personal scenes for the main guy, to remind you of the book. This movie is only recommended for those who read the book first, and who are into the dark futuristic genre (a clockwork orange,Brazil,etc)."
3,It was okay,"It *is* wise to read the book before watching the movie as the film did not describe Newspeak, thoughtcrime, or the politics of the continuing war with Eastasia/Eurasia. As a previous reviewer pointed out, this is going to lead to big gaps for someone who doesn't have a clue as to what the characters are referring to in the movie.The film did a so-so job of bringing to life the picture of the totalitarian world of Oceania and of Winston Smith's love affair and his thoughtcrimes of actually remembering bits and pieces of his childhood and trying to find who *he* was and not who Big Brother wanted him to be.In Richard Burton's last film, he played a wicked O'Brien but you could feel the lack of chemistry between him and John Hurt. This was especially evident during Smith's ""reeducation"" in the Ministry of Love of the ways of Big Brother and who Oceania was at war with (which kept changing every 5 seconds).The book is way better than the movie."
3,1984,We have not watched entire movie yet although this is a DVD we having been wanting for a long time after seeing snipets.
5,This movie is great(Buy it from DVDDistributors) for reliability,"This movie is perfect. Top notch futuristic and excellent. This rare MGM DVD will never be re-released or come out again, so buy this from the seller DVDDistribuotrs for they are the nost reliable I've ever encountered in my many years at Amazon. They have this product brand new and in stock. Excellent."
4,Introduction to classical (Quranic) Arabic grammar,"I found this book useful for an introduction to the construction and use of Arabic grammar. In addition it introduces some vocabulary that would be useful in reading the Q'uran. The good things about it are 1) its clarity in description, as well as the typeface and layout 2) it concision - it is not too much to absorb by oneself, so if you don't have access to a class and/or a teacher and have learned the script ,you can easily learn the grammar concepts that this book presents."
2,Didn't last long,The card lasted about 3 months then just died. I'm disappointed considering the cost. When it was working it seemed to have better range than my builtin centrino web access card. I don't know if I got a lemon but now I have to check the warranty.
1,What a let down!,"I returned the product the day I bought it.I installed the product on my rock solid win2000 machine.I did hook into my existing wifi-network, my machine crashed 3 times and over what must have been system resource conflicts.I couldn't keep the wireless card in the machine and play a MP3 at the same time....As soon as I popped the Nic out the system was back to normal..."
4,Good review of college Spanish,"This little book tells a story set in historic Argentina under the brutal dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, who controlled the country from 1829-1852. That information, and much more helpful background, comes from the notes in the book.I used this story as a review of my college Spanish from over 20 years ago. The story is very interesting, but even better for someone whose Spanish is shaky, the glossary includes all the words, and the notes are very helpful.Four, not five, stars because of the ending of the novel. I'm not sure, since this is labeled ""Book One"" if there's more to the story or not, but I didn't care for the way this particular story ended."
5,An excellently researched study.,An excellently researched and balanced study of small unit actions. Best I've ever read with credit being given to both sides. The author accompanies the narrative with dozens of good maps and leads the reader very smoothly through a rather complicated entanglement of fighting on the Russian front. Highly recommended.
2,"Bening of course Fabulous! Everyone else, try to catch up!",Anette of course is fabulous! what else would the 'reason de etre' be for this movie?
2,F as a Failure....,"What a stinkeroo! What a waste of time, talent, and energy! But if you crave a good horror movie, see ""The Ugly."" Then see ""In Dreams."" Then compare them. Put simply, there's no comparison. ""The Ugly"" will make you shiver,while ""In Dreams"" is simply a pretentious mess. Hold on. Maybe I'm being too harsh. After all, there must be something good about the film. Well, there's a nice performance from Toby, Annette Bening's dog, who's more convincing than Robert Downey's villain. Another plus is when the film is over and Roy Orbison sings ""In Dreams"" over the credits. It's hard to believe this film was directed by Neil Jordan, the same bloke who did the undervalued Bob Hoskins' starrer, ""Mona Lisa."""
2,terrifying,"now, this movie is a big mess. First mistake, the murder of little girls is no subject of entertainment and i don't think anyone can oppose a reply to this. But it's more than that; Annette bening is her usual self and therefore nothing great. Then you get downey jr who either is an excellent actor and should get the oscar or either needs a good therapy. Then you got an ending kind of ""scream"" thing, with a little bit of ""seven"" and a touch of ""kiss the girls"". The whole thing makes you feel very uncomfortable. if you didn't see this, you didn't miss something absolutely necessary."
2,Just Plain Bad - Check IMBD,I don't know how this movie gets a 4 out of 5 stars here. It's just bad. Check the Internet Movie Database (imbd) before you even think about wasting your time with this. It gets a 5.3 out of 10 there.
2,Silence of the lambs meets Alley McBeal...!,"'Good on you', Annette. She really puts her all into this movie. Sadly it's not enough. The rest of the cast seem to sleep walk through the entire length of the film. Hello! Stephen Rea - I swear to God his performance was so wooden, I doubt he even bent at the knees as he crossed the screen. The Cinematography is lovely, especially the underwater town (I'm a diver) but the story really goes awry, the characters show little concern for the plot, and Robert Downey. Jr plays Psycho like Bob Dylan, sans Guitar. The finale is straight out of a soap opera (did they run out of film, couldn't afford a less hammy performance?) Honestly, if you appreciate good mysteries and a good tale, if you want to be scared and convinced that something terrible is happening, then watch Alley McBeal, it's right up there with 'In Dreams'."
5,See This Film,"This brilliant and unsettling film received lackluster reviews during its' brief theatrical release, a fact that puzzles me. Suspenseful, disturbing, beautifully photographed, In Dreams also has a strong cast and a decent, believable script.The complex way Annette Benning portrayed Claire Cooper, a clairvoyant and illustrator, stunned me both as an actress and filmwatcher. Too deep to be a horror flick, too cerebral, perhaps, for the masses, but a must-see."
2,What A Disappointment,"After reading the customer reviews on this movie I went out and purchased a copy on DVD, although the photography is excellent and the underwater scenes are ever so disturbing, I found the movie to be just another predictable slasher movie. The acting was just terrible and the storyline ever so weak. If I had know this ahead of time I would have rented it first. Take my advise and save your money for something else more worthy."
3,Gripping ! It grabs you and NEVER lets go till the ending..,"I can't say to much about the plot because I don't want to give anything away - (unlike the bonehead, right under my review, who gives away the fate of the main character). This is a very disturbing film - please be warned. If you are sensitive to 'how much can a human being take' type of movie, be careful. With that said, this film is so intense that I could not take my eyes off the screen. By the time the ending credits started rolling, I found myself with the biggest tension headache for constantly being on the edge during the whole movie. It's done extreamly well, as far as directing and acting. Many scenes fullfill a need of TRUE suspense and shock value (something that is missing from a lot of today's films). The only weak spot is the final 15 minutes, which seems to get a bit 'silly' and WAY to far fetched - But nevertheless, a real suspenseful, haunting, and shocking story. It's too bad it had to be so disturbing."
1,A psychological suspense without the suspense,"How can you recommend a movie that's fear is apples? It's silly and Robert Downey Jr. is supposed to be a disturbed child killer but he comes off a psycho rock and roll singer, I could imagine drumsticks in his hands. The writer keep rehashing scenes of the boring drowning town scenes."
1,"Dull, boring and predictable","Unbelievably this is directed by the same person who made the Crying Game. Anyone expecting the same interesting quality can forget it. This should have gone straight to TV. It is too long, has terrible pace and character arc and ends up being rather embarrising for all concerned."
5,Loved it!,"I thought this was definately a great film. Very rarely does a movie give me that ""Don't turn around"" kind of feeling, but this was one of them. Like others, I don't want to give too much away, but if you like suspense, you will LOVE the ending!"
4,This One Beats All Mind-Twisters,"I have seen almost every horror and thriller movie made from 1986 to now. And this one tops all of them mad in the last 2 or 3 years because it doesnt have an ending made to have a sequel. It has an ending that lets YOU decide what happens. The movie also shows that dreams can come true, and some things sound fake but you have to believe in them. I think this movie is a great low-costing film."
5,It was so awesome and chilling...,"The actors who starred in it were all wonderful, and the forest scenes near the water were so hauntingly surreal. I have to say that Vivian was my favorite charicter, even though he was the 'bad' guy, the charicter was written so well. I have to buy it when the price dropps."
4,"Exciting, thrilling and intense",The person that called this movie boring and predictable must have seen the same movie that TV Guide did. The TV Guide rating system gave this movie a rating of 2 stars. I adamantly disagree with any rating less than 3. I couldn't keep my eyes off this film. It was well acted and full of suspense. You're missing 1 hour and 45 minutes worth of pure entertainment if you skip this movie.
2,What a mess,"I, quite frankly, adore Annette Bening as an actress. Bob Downey is quality too. This film, however, was/is a mess. It could have been so much better given the talent that was available, but it failed, in my opinion, simply because it was so erratic. Artistic license aside, the film was a jumble which detracted from the potential of the story-line.A shame, because the acting was excellent. If only the composition had matched the effort of the actors"
5,"""In Dreams"" gets two thumbs up from me!","""In Dreams"" is a great suspense movie! Unlike other films from its genre, ""In Dreams"" employs a unique storyline, setting it apart from the numerous cookie-cutter plots so common in movies in recent years. With a very talented ensemble, ""In Dreams"" captivates the audience from beginning to end, particularly through the outstanding performance of the lead role played by Annette Bening. Though the mood of this film is rather dark, it is not violent, gory, or gruesome (another aspect of filmmaking that is overdone). ""In Dreams"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
1,IN DREAMS-WORST MOVIE EVER MADE,Single worst movie ever made! It's a series of disturbing puzzle pieces that the watcher hopes will all come together only to have it end making no sense at all!!!! A complete waste of two hours of my life. IMDB rates in 5 out of 10 stars. I say that's being generous. No wonder it bombed at the box office.
5,Treasured Book,"I have used the recipes in this book many years and enjoyed them immensely. This is my favorite cuisine when I cook for myself (I'm not Asian) because its good, healthy, fast, and clean-up is easy. Overall very efficient and wonderful. Most of these recipes use simple readily available ingredients found in an Asian Market or large supermarket."
4,A Good Adventure Book,"Sister Of The South, by Emily Rodda, is about Lief and his friends defeating the sisters. The sisters are dragons that lived in the deep sea, killing their prey with their acid breath. Lief bravely traveled through mountains and under the lea to reach the Sister of the South. Lief also tried stopping the dragons from spreading the Toran Plaque. As lief continued his heroic adventure the Shadow lord awaits in the darkness.The book, Sister Of the South is a fantasy book. It includes made up creatures such as dragons. There is also made up destinations like: Del, Toran, and The Island Of The Dead. There is also made up creatures like the Shadow Lord.What I like about this book is the action. Like when they fought the dragons circling the moon. What I doen't like about this book is when some of the good characters get hurt."
1,Not that great.,"I got an ad from the author for this book in my email, asking me to read this. I read it last night. The people didn't seem real to me."
4,Fram Air Hog,"Overall: Better air flow than conventional air filter, but could be better on filtration.I have a '99 Toyota Rav-4, and this air filter works great. It offers more airflow, and last 250,000 miles. The only air filters better are AMSOIL eA air filters, which are made in an extremely advanced process using the best materials, unlike paper filters. Amsoil filters offer more air AND the absolute best filtration at the same time, and last for up to 4 years. Remember that dirty air can ruin an engine quick, because it gets in the lube oil and grinds against cyllinder liners and can make hydraulic valve lifters fail. These are very precise parts, and if a lifter failed, a piston would slam through a valve that was left open and blow it out of the cyllinder head into the exhaust or even into the intake of another cyllinder. [....]."
5,THE Digital Camera...,"Before buying this little gem, I looked at almost every digital on the market. This was the only one that accepts both types of flash memory (CompactFlash and SmartMedia), it's also one of the very few digital SLRs that don't cost a fortune. Camera is a cinch to operate, whether you're a pro or an amateur. Only real quibble I have is the oddball size of the lens (43mm) - try finding a 43mm step-up ring in your corner camera store! Autofocus is supurb, the resolution is incomparable, and coupled with a good photo-printer, this cannot be beat."
4,Great Medical Reference Book,John Hopkins is one of the top Hospitals in the country and they are also a teaching hospital.A medical reference book prepared by them is one that I feel is reliable as well as easy to read. It gives you information that helps you understand your medical problem but in no way should be used in place of seeing a physician.It arrived promply and in very good condition. Way to go Amazon!
3,"Good story, but lacking in comparison","Really, I wish I would have bought the original. Strangely enough we had the original version borrowed from the library in the house when this book arrived. Even my 2 1/2 year old daughter prefers the original. It is so much better. The details are more vivid. The language more interesting. This version isn't bad; it just isn't AS good."
4,Good Moral Values and Entertaining Reading,"By the time I was 14, I had collected every Trixie book that there was. It was fun pretending to be a part of the Bobwhite Club and to have a hand in solving mysteries. I didn't know it at the time, but those books reinforced the small town values that have served me so well in a big city. My daughters are now approaching the appropopriate age bracket for these books. I can't wait to introduce them to my old friends."
5,One of Da Buzz's Best,"This is one of my favorite Da Buzz offerings. Included on this Single CD are the following:1. Alive (Radio Edit)2. Alive (Extended)3. Alice (C&N; Club Mix)4. Alive (Edit)5. Stop, Look, ListenThis CD is well worth having but I doubt if anyone would pay the price they are asking here for it. I was able to get mine much cheaper."
2,Disappointing - could do better!,"I have not bought this, but I have seen copies before and used them.I was not very pleased with the selection of songs - they only concentrate on the songs featured in the film, which, frankly, isn't many at all. What is written has been arranged, so much in fact that `Cabaret' itself is spread over 2-3 pages (as a chorus number) which looses all the emotion and essence of the song. All of the songs loose the feel for the show in the way it has been arranged and by how much of the songs are cut!On a more positive note, it is for piano and voice so, essentially, it is `easy to play' with (guitar) chords. It includes songs which aren't widely available, i.e. Mein Herr, Maybe This Time, Money-Money, (not available in the vocal Score). They are almost suitable for concert performances, if re-arranged.I would not recommend buying this book at all, only if you can't, for example, play anything more difficult!"
4,Great quality and fast shipping,Very comfortable. I have large hands and the large size fit nicely. They make you want to punch something. ;)
4,pretty good price good glove wears well,"I use these for MMA type workout on bags& blocking pads, and they have worked well. They give good protection even when hitting hard. I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves. Overall I would reccomend, about the same or less than other gloves from everlast, century, ect and just as good quality.FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads ""pockets"" are attached (especially on the fingers) that you can't see well in the picture advertised. I do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this, I wouldn't use them to spar as these would tend to cut. (most people would use ""fighting gloves"" to spar anyway, but just trying to be helpful !!)"
3,Was good while it lasted...didn't last long!,"I was able to enjoy the gloves for about 3 weeks. By the third week my left gove develped a tear that separted the padding from the knuckle side of my index finger. I'm not a huge guy, not a monster of fighter. The gloves are labled ""Bag Glove"" and that's what I had been using them for.The gloves do provide the wrist support needed for hard strikes along with padding needed to save your hands.They're not very expensive so in a sense, you get what you pay for."
2,Think twice before buying online for a woman's fit.,"I bought these gloves for kickboxing because I wanted an open finger area. The gloves are not sized for women. I bought a men's medium since I had tried on a men's small in a store. The medium initially felt okay when using, but has since expanded. Not sure why--leather? sweat? At any rate, I have to wrap them really tight around my wrist in order to get them to stay on properly. Otherwise, no issues. If you are an intense woman kickboxer, I would strongly suggest buying them from a place where you can try them on. I kick about 2 to 3 times per week and switch on and off between these and full-coverage type of gloves."
5,One of the best Bohemes on DVD,"I absolutely agree with all the positive comments made about this DVD version. Fiamma Izzo D'Amico's quiet beauty, superb singing and acting along with Pavarotti at his height make this DVD the one to watch again and again. Even the camera work is marvelous. The panning and scanning is in absolute synchronization with the flow of the music. So good in fact, that one is hardly aware of the presence of the camera. Was Giancarlo Menotti as ""Director"" responsible for the planning of this production? Credit for this marvelous performance also should go to the conducting of Leone Magiera. My only very minor criticism is the generally ""soft"" image quality which is probably due to its 1986 dating."
4,Many spiritual insights!,I chose the four star rating because I do not believe that anything written can be all things to all people.This gently written book about a young girl and her experiences with her guardian angel can enlighten many if they are receptive to it.I recommend this book to those who are able to pick out the gems of wisdom hidden and/or obvious in the writing. These gems can be spiritually advanatageous to those who are not turned off by what may seem as unbelievable. God does use circumstances such as these to convey spiritual truths. It would grieve me for someone to read the book out of curiosity and then ridicule it.
5,Under Angel Wings,"It is a well written book about the true story of Sister Maria Antonia and herlife as a child who gets to know her Guardian Angel, who guides her, to do what is right."
4,Funny story lines,The entire cast is very funny and the story lines are believable. I did not give it five stars because of the ongoing immoral relationship between Coach Fox and Christine. This show is not for children.
1,Coach - The First Season (Limited Edition),Although I haven't seen this DVD I have watched the show many...many...many times. And was excited it came to DVD...so I can watch it many...many...many more times.
1,Forewarned,"""Best comedy ever?"" Maybe, if you go for constant bed hopping and a touchy feely feminist agenda guaranteed to make you wretch. Try to have a baby but can't? It's his fault along with oodles of other American males. Coach shouldn't object to his daughter bedding guys old enough to be her grandfather. Coach is insensitive and she is just trying to find her way. All of this garbage dates this series, big time. As for fashion: Is Christine somewhere under all that hair? If her toothpick, construction nail legs (in full view from the skirts that ran out of material and wound up around her neck) didn't pin Coach to the mattress, her nails will claw him to death. After I threw up, I gave ""COACH"" to the garbage person. For a real treat, re-introduce yourself to MARY TYLER MOORE & BOB NEWHART. And, I am WAY over 13!"
5,GREAT entertainment!!,"This is one of the best sitcoms ever. I was born in 76, and this show premiered in 89. I never watched it when it first aired. I think, because I didn't like football (and still don't like football), that I wouldn't enjoy a sitcom about a football coach. So I never gave it a chance. Until a few years ago, I seen a few reruns on TV and was hooked. The DVD release is a treat for me, because I don't have the USA network, and therefore haven't been able to even watch reruns. If you are a Seinfeld fan, or Curb Your Enthusiasm fan...and like sophisticated smart comedy, you will like this series! And if you are like me, and don't care for football...don't worry, you won't even notice the parts about football, because there is so much more going on besides that!!"
5,One of the funniest shows ever.,This is such a great show offering so many laughs that I only wish they would distribute all of the seasons on DVD. I know lots of people would buy them in a heartbeat.
5,Great Package Great Show,"Job well done, This show really has always made me laugh from my heart and now i own it.. a dream come true"
4,It's close to being an all time classic comedy,"I wouldn't say it was the best sitcom every written... but, it is definitely one of my favorites.This show was one of those that I remember growing up and watching every week with my parents. We all laughed and enjoyed every episode. Like many have mentioned... it isn't really about football.. it's about 4 main characters relating to eachother despite their differences. If you have a good sense of humor you will love everything this show has to offer."
4,Very good deal,"When I first checked the record it looked like it had a bad scratch, but when the person I bought it for tried it it worked great. This is the first time I have purchased a record since the 80's....(;))..."
3,Good Starting Point,"While I've definitely seen much better documentaries about the subjects of nutrition, obesity and diabetes, Killer at Large would be a good starting point for someone who is less familiar with the topics. The use of multiple authors and the titles of their related books would be a great place for the newly interested to start a reading list. The graphic video of the 12 year old girl getting liposuction should make an impact on people who may be innured to the standard screenshots of overweight people wattling around unidentified cities. The documentary also does a good job of touching on the multiple factors wrapped up in the debate about obesity/diabetes and clearly demonstrates why the answer is far less simple than it appears at a glance. That said, it wasn't well edited and is very much an introduction documentary rather than a serious investigation or source of really informative material. I'm glad I watched it, but it won't be going on my ""need to own"" list."
3,Informative,"This is a somewhat informative film on nutrition in America with a focus on schools. Unfortunately it politicized obesity...representing republicans as bad, democrats as good. The Federal government en-total has responsibility and the Department of Education should be abolished and allow local communities to govern their schools. My child was in the school system it the 80's and 90's and took his own lunch. It is appalling what the schools are serving and offering for children to buy according to this film. Major problems with food in America is big business, farm subsidies, government that is too big, lack of eating food in its purest form, family structure, and earth that has been overworked and laden with chemicals. Anything that is processed or in a can should be generally regarded as a ""cadaver in a can""...dead food."
3,Solid,"The film opens with the media firestorm over the fact that a twelve year old girl named Brooke Bates, who weighed over 200 pounds, was allowed by her parents to have liposuction. After the surgery, she is shown vamping it up- extolling her newfound popularity, but then the film shows that less than a year after her surgery she has gained the weight back. The interesting thing is that the film shows that the fault is it is part nurture (Brooke eats obsessively to combat psycho-emotional problems) and part nature (her parents are not obese and the fat goes to parts of her body unaffected by the surgery). A quick Google search shows that, in the years since the film was made, Bates has become obsessed with plastic surgery and looking like a Barbie doll, but that's the subject for another documentary and review."
5,Really good,"I really enjoyed this documentary. The part that really stood out was when parents brought their kids candy and junk food during school hours as a way of protesting the schools decision to only offer healthy options in school vending machines. I understand parents were mad and all ""don't tell MY kids what they can and can't eat"", but bringing them candy and junk food just mad the parents look ignorant."
2,scratched DVD,"I didn't have time to return the item and had to use it ""as is."" It had scratches on it that prevented normal play, so that it often ""skipped ahead of damaged areas."" (That's what my computer kept telling me: ""Skipping over damaged areas."" :-("
3,Trouble getting the DVD to play,"I have not been able to get the first side of the DVD to play. The second side worked really well, but would like to watch the first side too. Have had a family situation that has taken me away from home and have not been able to try again."
3,"Very confusing, with so many characters, but romance and surprises.","This wa definately ""Charles Dickens"", so many characters and stories going on at the same time, it was confusing just a bit for me, I thought it had some very big surprises, and that made it interesting, However, I did get lost among the characters, It was good story, revolving around a river which Dickens liked his rivers. I would reccoment this to lovers and followers of Charles Dickens, but not romantics, as even though there is romance, it is not up to my standards. It was a bit intriuqing , but I would not go through it again, on the other hand, I would, and have, wathced ""Little Dorrit"" more than once. I am sure there are those who think this was his best work, and maybe they could be right if they are indeed a fan of his,which I find his stories a bit gruesome ,and sad."
2,so so,"really so so.... ... with the whole library of British movies we have this is one we watched only once and never desired to see it again - we simply kept it but it depends of what you like - for is is,,,again,,,,just so so"
4,Start seeds right!,"I am a backyard gardener, and purchased this item last season to start all my own seedlings. It worked quite adequately and brought the temperature to a good germination range quite readily. My seeds started right off, and then I transferred them to a tray with grow light after they germinated. The plastic isn't the thickest and although I will get at least another year out of it, I'm not sure how long the lifespan will be. I also have used the unit without purchasing the dirt pellets and just placed a pot w/ starting mix in it. The heat mat and dome are still effective to get things going."
3,Heat mat does not fit,"Like one of the other reviewers commented, the heating mat packaged with the tray is not the one the tray was designed for (at least in the package I got). It does not look like the heating mat pictured on the box and does not say Jiffy on it. The cord comes out one of the short sides, not at the end of one of the long sides as needed to match up with the hole in the tray. So the mat does not fit in my tray unless I cut another hole in the tray which will weaken it.I already started adding water to the pots when I noticed this so I'm not gonna try to return it. I'll just make it work, but really annoying as the tray is clearly designed to allowfor a cord, but the wrong mat is packaged."
3,Heat mat doesn't fit plastic tray.,"The main reason I bought this set up is because I wanted the seedling heat mat. The heat mat works perfectly. The plastic tray that comes with the heat mat was designed for a different style heat mat and they do not fit together as they should in order to transfer the heat properly.(the place where the cord attaches is different.) For that reason, it gets a 3. The dome/plastic tray is of very flimsy quality, which I expected, for the price. If I had it to do again, I would have bought one that holds small pots instead of jiffy pots, with a higher domed clear lid. I bought the cheapest set up, and that's what I got. No, I would not buy this product again."
2,Ok for the money I guess,I was very disappointed in the quality of this item. When it arrived the strings were already coming apart from the part that holds them in place. They won't stay tight and it's cheap wood. I guess I expected better quality for the money but I was wrong.
3,disappointed,"The 23 inch Kid's Acoustic Toy guitar was the exact size I needed, but the strinks became loose and the knobs to tighten the strings did not work. When we tried to tighten the strings, the knobs turned, but it did not secure the strings in place and they became loose again. Other than that we thought the guitar was good looking, but my grandson can not strum it successfully. I know it is just a toy, but the knobs to tighten the strings never did work. The first attempt to strum the instrument once we took it out of the box until now, is still a silent guitar."
3,1st Kino (Kyno) CD,"This is an early recording of Victor Tsoy (Tsoi) with 6 other musicians when they formed the famous poetic anti-Soviet Russian Rock-N-Roll band Kino (Kyno) which means ""Cinema"" in English. 2 of the musicians were from the Rock band ""Aquarium"" that discovered Victor Tsoy (Tsoi) at a Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Rock Club. The CD was poorly recorded in a studio in 1982 because it sounds like a live recording in a small club. Only a few musicians play at a time with primitive acoustical sound effects & in a few songs the guitars sound out of tune. In this recording Victor Tsoy (Tsoi) lacks his later deep mystery of a voice & sings like a Russian Bob Dylan or a strange Elvis Presley. This CD is very hard to find but I found it in Kiev Ukraine during our past vacation.For Kino (Kyno) fans only"
4,A good collectible,Much better than part 5. More action and less talking. To many fights cut short on the filming part but some were from start to finish
1,Rip off,"If youve already seen Hood Life 2, save your money. This DVD isnt worth buying. Most of it, is a bunch of recycled clips from Hood Life 2. Like one of the previous reviews said,3 is the best"
4,Good value,"Easy to assemble, works well, not the best, not for a non-professional, this is really the best bang for your buck. Great give, serves as a decorative piece very well in modern spaces.-r"
2,first love deceived,"Sex scenes are not graphic, but are unsettling, BUT!....teens are having to face these issues on a more regular basis, and why not in books written for them with a lesson included? I think this book teaches a lesson about not getting involved in a relationship with an older man. But instead of finding herself on her own she falls immediately into another relationship. I found that a disappointment. The ending was a little unbelievable. But all in all I would recommend it to older ya readers. -YA Librarian"
2,read Francesca Lia Block instead,"This book has basically no substance whatsoever. It's Sweet Valley High goes to the vintage clothing shop. I didn't find the characters partiularly unique or likeable, and Whitcher's writing is mediocre at best. If you're looking for something along similiar subject lines, but written in beautiful prose with engaging chacters, pick up something by the fabulous Ms. Block."
1,trash,"This is trash for young adults disguised in fantasy so that this awful writer can...get away with filtering in statutory rape, threesomes, illicit sex and disdain for any thing moral. So badly written...Kirkus is right on, this one is dressed in dirty modern clothes. Whitcher insults the intelligence and even the good judgement of young adults."
2,GREAT SONGS / POOR MIXING,"I have never heard David Knapp live but his mixing on this CD is not that great. I admit most of these songs on the two CD's are big club hits but the way they are presented on this CD; it becomes boring. I would receommend Vol. 2 of the same series to anybody which in my opinion is a lot better than this compilation. However, if you can get your hands on some singles on this CD that would be great."
4,Enjoyable and insightful.,This is a very easy-to-read work and it addresses a lot of questions I have had about the persisting limp-wristedness of the Democrats. It tries very hard to be non-partisan (though Dionne is a professed liberal) and he asks a lot of questions begging to be answered by both sides of the political spectrum.I only wish it could have been a little more scholarly and in depth. Nonetheless it was a pleasure to read.
2,"For a book on writing, it is a disgrace that the Kindle version has so many typos!","This is not about the book, but about the typo-ridden Kindle version of the book.Let ""rne"" explore instead of let ""me"" explore?!""thxe"" reader instead of ""the"" reader?Whoever made the Kindle version just ran the book through a text recognition software and left it at that."
4,A MUST-HAVE BOOK,"If you are an amateur telescope maker, avid amateur astronomer with a jones for hardware, or are just interested in optics--YOU NEED THIS BOOK. Some rather technical sections do not detract from the hands-on user knowledge that makes it popular. Your friends will think you are an optics expert when you critique their scopes, but more importantly, it will help you get the best perfromance from your own equipment.It MUST be a GREAT book, as some used book dealers are asking double the new cost...and it's still in print!."
4,Fun read,"This was a good, fun read. My wife, a low level SW fan also really enjoyed it. It really got her into the character of Mara Jade and further into the SW verse."
5,Simply Fantastic!,"This comic, Emperor's Hand, is an example of how good things can get you get the right artist and a great plot. You get an insight into the life of Mara Jade and how she came to be in the paperback novels. This comic is exciting and really fast paced. I enjoyed it and I am sure any fan of Star Wars will too."
1,I second that motion....,"I agree fully with the reader from Maryland: Mara Jade stinks. She's like a 2-D, transparent cartoon character, like Catwoman or something. It's laughable how stupid her character is, how utterly unoriginal. It says something about the Mud-For-Brains fans who just LOVE her so much..."
4,Just what I pictured,"I just got this book and I really liked it. I am not a comic book person, this and Union are the only ones that I have read. I was very impressed with how Mara was drawn. In Union she looked like a cute teenager, in this she looked real. You know that she is well trained and brillant, but also beautiful. Her expressions were perfect. The story was interesting, but I liked it more for the visual images than the plot. I just wish that it had gone back further into her life. I know that she was kidnapped at age 4, but how and why? And what occured in the years following? She is the most interesting character in the Star Wars universe, and I just want to know more about her."
3,"Nice writer, but ...","I got both the Skynn and a Core from Rotring. My basis of comparison is with the old Schaeffer school pens and some Watermans.For writing I like how very smooth it is. Still has what I'm finding to be the characteristic Rotring stiffness of nib, but that's easy to adjust too. It flows every bit as smooth as the Watermans (and already feels sturdier).The downsides: 1) no converter, you're stuck with cartridges or finding a converter and 2) the cap takes quite a pull to remove and it's in two parts -- plastic liner and metal cover -- and the two parts separated. A dab of glue and some use and it will be more smooth, I'm sure.But the combination of cap and no converter get it a 3 star rating from me. More expensive than the Core, but the Core includes a converter and no cap problem.Very comfortable to write with, however."
5,Un grand film de mr franco,"Un grand film série B des années 60 qui fait partie de ma vidéothèque ! a regarder absolument surtout pour le personnage de miss death, incarne par Estella Blain qui fait ici une prestation remarquable ."
4,Heard them at the Erasure Concert in Chicago (3/10/03),This duo has a promising sound! They were the opening act for Erasure in Chicago and played a limited set for obvious reasons (crowd was there for Erasure!). The music mix was very good and the vocals were energetic and well-performed. They remind me a lot of Swing Out Sister or early Everything But The Girl. They should be an act to keep tabs on in the future!
5,Excellent book,"Written by Gral. Juan B. Vargas, not just a ""Dorado"", but he (and his brothers) had a very close relationship with Villa, his brother Cipriano Vargas died Columbus. This book has a short bio of most of the ""Dorados"" as they appear in the group photo. It also includes a detailed interview with Benjamín Argumedo just before he died (unique information); plus many stories about his days with Villa. This is not a novel."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"Dan Fogel isn't the expert he portrays himself to be- I found most of his comments, pricing and research to be based not on factual print run numbers, popularity, nor demand. Bob Overstreet, notorious for the same lame tactics, misinformation and pricing, based on how many issues he has in his own archives is responsible for publishing it. In other words-DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
4,Fogel's Underground Comix Price Guide by Dan Fogel (ASIN: B000FDN8RY),"Recently published in 2006, Fogel's Underground Guide (termed the FUG) is the FIRST comprehensive reference guide on UGs in over 24 years.Strengths: Updated pricing for over 1,000 underground titles, pricing data derived from years of data from leading sources (eBay, GPAnalysis, Heritage) and senior advisors closely tied with UGs, updated printing information for most UGs published after 1982, important updates to information originally presented in Kennedy (1982), updated adult comix listings.Weaknesses: Depth of Kennedy 1982's information on artistic contribution and distinguishing printings simply not possible today, some typos, inclusion of adult or `porn' comix (some say).Printing information is simplified and definitive."
4,Great Book,"Although I've been out of collecting, comix sitting in boxes for many years, it's nice to see something come on the market that can put some sort of value comix from this genre. A guide like this has been long overdue.For me, as I am going through my comix, trying to estimate a value of my collection, it has brought back many good stories and good memories I had forgotten about.a must have for any underground comix collector!"
5,What a wonderful book!,"The one panel gag cartoon is a classic in comic strip lore and nobody did it better than Hank Ketcham. Ketcham's talent is on full display in the first volume of The Complete Dennis The Menace.Like the Peanuts collection, this first volume is an attractively packaged hardbound edition and includes a bookmark that is attached to the spine. Instead of chapters, the cartoons are broken in months. There is some background material on how Dennis came to be and information on Hank Ketcham.Dennis is still in many newspapers. He is handled by Ketcham's former assistance Marcus Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton, the recent winner of the Reuben Award for best newspaper cartoon of the year, is one of the nicest artists in comics today.All current Dennis readers will enjoy the first appearance of this Menace. Others that have not read Dennis in while; will enjoy the flood of memories of this Holy Terror. So, take some time to visit with your 'ol pal Dennis"
5,Why they call him the Menace.,"Dennis the Menace was arguably the greatest single panel comic strip of all time (sorry, Family Circus fans). This book reprints every panel from the first two years of the strip's existence. Sunday pages are not included, since those are not single panels and wouldn't fit in the book. This is great stuff; really funny. If you like Dennis the Menace, you'll love this book."
2,"Geat book, weak HB book binding","The 3rd party selling provided me excellent service for this book that I purchased as a gift. They even replaced it once. The problem is with the HB binding on the book-- poor HB design possibly for too many pages. Inside the front and back cover it tears and pulls apart from the binding. The book content is a fun read...they just added too many pages for the strength of the binding.Both copies sent to me received binding damage in the mail prior and they were packaged well.Seller tried to provide quality service. A fun and light family read, just don't purchase it as a gift."
5,MARILYN AT HER BEST,"I love the cd. Sound is good, and it was a treat to hear Down in the meadow and her rendition of WHEN I FALL IN LOVE, shows Marilyn had a great range. Recomended."
4,great boots,"I love these boots. I have gotten so many compliments on them. You can turn down the top, giving them a whole different look. They are quite comfortable and they look great. Can't ask for more."
4,"Funny, funny, funny!",A scathing satire of Hollywood and its egos. Some great performances and lots of fun cameos. I was intrigued by the title because it sounded like a z-grade science fiction movie. But it turned out to be a really funny mock documentary about the making of a really bad z-grade science fiction movie - but nobody involved realizes it's really bad. Terrific dialogue throughout. Hail Gropo!
2,headache..,If you ever need customer service or support you should plan on a lot of hassles and a lot of wasted time. my experience has been very poor and very unorganized customer service/support.
4,Great case at a great price.,"Bought this for my first build 10 months ago. Plenty of room, both spacially and for expansion; accommodates 120mm fans; the top input panel (1 firewire, 2 USB, mic and headphone) is very convenient. And, IMO, it's sharp looking. Cool black brushed metal front and gloss black all around save for one clear side. Solid yet light. You'll be pleased..."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I'm a huge horror movie fan and I always rent those straight to video horror flicks that I usually end up hating. However, I have finally come upon one that actually works. It's not very scary, but I think the stroyline is well thought out with a surprising twist at the end that I did not see coming. A high school girl sees a horror movie, and she starts saying ""I wish so and so would""...then they actually happen. The girl believes it has something to do with the movie, as she keeps seeing someone dressed like the killer in the movie. The acting is pretty decent for a horror flick, and the ladies will get a nice bonus with the stunt casting of Drew Lachey of 98 Degrees fame, who isnt half bad. The actress is the lead is very believable makes for the perfect heroine. While nowhere near the creativity of Scream, Spliced is a perfect late night horror flick that will satisfy."
2,From the minds of the people responsible.,"OK let's take a couple of horror flicks, steal some ideas, then get a bunch of unknowns to act in it.Hmmm.... it needs something, oh yes we need a singer from a boy band, how about 98 degrees?Now we need a monster let's take Freddy Kruger's glove but make them clear plastic claws instead. Now we give it a whole 'Ring' feel. Oh and wait, wait... we need a twist ending like in Scream. Boy this is great.OK we need a beautiful girl to star in it. Let's get that gorgeous, voluptious blonde who came in for an audition the other day.... She's not available? Who do we got? You're kidding that flat chested brunette who looks like Olive Oil on a bad hair day? Ok but don't pay her as much.Lights, Camera....Action!"
5,"Even funnier than ""The Mouse That Roared""","I bought this movie based on reviews I read here on Amazon.com and wasn't disappointed. I watched ""The Mouse That Roared"" first and thought it was funny, but in my opinion this movie is even better.Magaret Rutherford is great as the clueless Grand Duchess, I wish there was more of her in the movie.Ron Moody does a great job as the prime minister who is hung up on getting running hot water for his bathtub at any cost.There was a small take off on Dr. Strangelove that I liked. Two ex-German scientists one for the US and one for the USSR give their boss a Nazi salute before catching themselves.I had some good laughs throughout the movie. If you liked ""The Mouse That Roared"" I'm sure you'll like this movie."
3,Not as Good as the Original,"Fitfully funny satire about the space race but it is not as amusing as ""The Mouse That Roared."" Sorely lacking here is the presence of Peter Sellers. It's interesting to watch political satire of it's time but the space race does not have the resonance today that the arms race did."
1,"bad,very bad","This novel is very possibly the worst storyline I have ever read; oh wait, forget possibly, it IS the very worst story I have every read. Don't buy it, borrow it or steal it. It is nonsensical dribble."
3,Strange Justice,"Broken into 3rds this book is equal parts, good end of the world stuff, rediculous metaphorical american satire, and a very sad father's story.Personally, it was a let down for me after such strong endorcements for Morrow."
2,So this is the way the world ends... pretty lame,"I felt this book did little to captivate my attention. The introduction, with the use of the prophet, made it somewhat interesting, but then the book dragged on and on. The main character never seemed developed enough. This book bogs one down with pointless descriptions of EACH different type of nuclear weapon. The average reader will find this quite time consuming decifering what Morrow is trying to add here. I've read a few books about the world ending, but this one does little to excite me in terms of content. The actual destruction was brief, and 80% of the book seemed quite pointless. Either way, I hope you find a better book than this, especially if you enjoy these kind of novels."
3,Worth thinking about,"I disagree with this writer on a lot of things-most notably all his other books (especially The City of Truth, his book about how wonderful it is to be a liar). However, this book is worthwhile; although disagreeable in many ways to my particular worldview. Let it never be said that Mr. Morrow does not have a brain. A lot of thought has obviously gone into this book. I just hope all those who read it put forth some of their own in response...this book deserves it."
5,Pure Magic!,"I have been studying Astrology for years, own at least 40 some books, but it was not until I came upon this book that it all made sense in a cohesive way. Richard's delineation techniques are wonderful- especially for those of us who approach astrology from a depth/Jungian point of view, and want to help our clients evolve in a meaningful way.I can't recommend this book highly enough- too bad the limit is five stars."
1,I think I'll pass on this one,"This game show game leaves a lot to be desired. The answer-recognition is way off and the graphics are atrocious. Playing along with the show while watching it is a lot funner than this. But the final nail in the coffin would be that comedian Louie Anderson is in this game, complete with his ""witty"" remarks that will make you curse your Playstation."
3,It's OK!,Pros: Fun and easy to play.Cons: Surveys repeat too often. Slow loading. Unlifelike characters.
1,Family Feud,We bought this game after buying Super Scattergories because it was by the same company and we thought it would be fun. It is very borin and slow paced. What I can't figure out is why it is still available but Super Scattergories-the funnest computer game in the world--is no longer made.
2,Let's Play The Feud!....sort of.,"This game could have been a lot better.First off there is no returning champion mode (just like the new Feud right now.)Second the music on the game is horrible.I though it would have the FF '99 theme but it just a lot of keyboard crap.Just think if Richard Dawson or Ray Combs were still hosting the Feud this game would have been 100% better with returning champions,Bullseye or the famous Family Feud music heard in the 70's to early 90's Still it's a good game to play with a lot of people and Louie Anderson actually made me crack up a few times.The Family Feud game (1994) for the 3DO is still much better."
4,Good for kids,"Grandsons loved it, have seen all three Arthur and the invisibles movies. kept them well entertained age 4 and 6"
5,"It's a cable, what can go wrong?","Well, what's to say? It's a DVI cable. It arrived as described but actually, surprisingly, it did have an issue. It wouldn't seat on one end of the cable, correctly. It took a lot of pressure and a little reshaping to get the plug tightened.I get a jump on my screen from time-to-time but I have no way of testing if that is the cable, monitor or video card, so I didn't take any rating away."
1,Scraped and dissapointed,"Well i was thinking in the video game and if that was new, and i receive the package and surprise! The box of plastic where is the CD is scraped and when i order the Frogger, i choose NEW not SCRAPED. Shame of you for sale bad things."
3,Will not save.,"I have a PS2 and it wont save to my memory card. I don't know if it's the game or memory card, but the card works for my other games. I looked up the level select cheat though so i can pick up where I left off. The game is super complex and hard, the angles sometimes make it even more difficult, but the challenge is the fun! The noises get annoying too."
2,Not as good as the first one,"I really liked the first one. This one is a bit boring, as there isn't that much different to it. the camera is very jerky and it is often hard to see what is ahead which means you die quite alot which is unfair. I don't mind dying if it's my fault, but not when you can't see what's going on. I was expecting alot more from the multiplayer, but it's not that great - gets boring after an hour."
4,Fairly Easy but fun game,"This game was a bit easy to beat. I beat it in about 3 and a half hours. I am glad I didn't buy the game. I just rented it. This game can be pretty chalenging at some parts. I don't know about a game where the last level is easier than the first 3 levels. Other than that this game was good. There is a good abount of multiplayer games and Time trials to keep you playing the game. Unlike the previous game I played which was Gamecubes Luigi's Mansion, there is plenty of stuff to do in this game even after you beat it. It is also a very straighforward game in which you always know what to do next. Its just that you have you time your jumps perfectly. These are the types of games that I like cause you don't need to check a player's guide just to beat the game. This is why I gave the game 4 stars. I also previously stated the reasons why I didn't give the game 5 stars."
2,"Looks good, but way too small","This belt looks great - very sturdy, long strip of velcro, solid steel roller buckle. The trouble is is the size. I have a 38"" waist and the ""XL"" comes nowhere CLOSE to fitting. I measured the circumference of the belt cinched as loosely as possible - 34"" - since when is that an ""XL"" size? If there were a ""XXL"" that went out past 38"" I'd exchange, but that doesn't seem to be an option. Returned, shopping elsewhere."
5,Perfect competition belt,"I have three belts like this in different sizes-- all by Harbinger-- and this one is great, too. I needed a 4"" for competition and this one fit great and is comfortable to wear. It also meets the 100% raw standards at a great price. It's become my new everyday belt for powerlifting."
3,Object Thinking,"Overall the book was pretty good. I have a feeling that its content could hve been copressed in half the size. There were quite a few ""doh"" moments for me, meaning that book stated something way tooo obvious for everyone. Nevertheless, I would reccmmend this book to all programmers and possibly project managers."
2,Shrill propaganda for software anarchists,"Useful, but not terribly original, content undermined by smug self-congratulating boosterism. Alternates between run-of-the-mill thinking on domain modeling, pseudo-intellectual philosophical tangents, and foaming-at-the-mouth extreme programming propaganda. Deeply slanted, with a degenerate view of software engineering."
3,eighth game not number one,"this is fun and well worth the price that its going for right now, just as good as the last few games but not the best. one of the cool features is called nail the trick. It goes into slo mo and you can control the way the board spins with the dual sticks. Other than nail the trick the game is essentially the same as the others, so if you like TH then get this, personally im going to be enhoying skate for its new technology. either way i recommend this game!"
2,Sigh...,"Very disappointed with this game. As a skater i was impressed with the overall styles captured from the various tricks, but this is no ""next gen"" game...the amount of options available to customize your skater is puzzling....how is that THPS II had more options??? The graphics are horrible, the start screen even looks low budget, the highlight of this game is the new nail the trick mode which actually makes the gameplay more challenging/ realistic but alas this does not make the game. I think what the future of pro skater needs is to venture more into the direction of being a sim...i.e, having your skater progressingly learn tricks, how about real physics...when you grind on something your skater slows down instead of rocketing off...spend some time designing an actual living city."
4,"Son Happy with game, Imressed with graphics","As a parent I was happy with my sons reaction. As a gaming enthusiast, I was happy with the game play and impressed with the graphics.The game has various types of gameplay and my son seems content with character development, which to me is a little odd but the developers seem to have found something that kids find intruiging."
1,Damaged product,"Just got this in the mail, popped it into my new xbox 360 and it said it was unreadable, the bottom was covered in scratches. I guess you get what you pay for, just hoped the company would have more integrity then to sell a unusable copy."
3,Same old same old,They need to do some changes with these games. It's all been a button mashing balancing act. Something like Skate broke new boundaries with skating video games. This game proves to be best when at a drinking party.
1,Simple: Crap,"Please do not spend your money in this game, if you want to feel the skateboarding as it is buy skate 1,2 or 3 any of them. But Tony Hawk (well so time ago i.e. for play station 1 was awsome)suck!!! you just press x and the skate seems like a car accelerating jajajaj and you make an ollie over a house!!! nothing real at all!!!!"
2,doesnt touch american wasteland,because american wasteland had no load time they must have thrown the load time to this game. when your in free mode it takes 7 seconds to load the next player on the list...... n64 was faster...... no customization either not a very good game this is a game that u want to rent not buy first
2,More of the same,"Frankly, I was greatly disappointed. Sure, the gameplay itself is the same, and I had no problem running up big combos, etc. But the game has, like the last 3 or 4 games before it, gone down the ""let's put in lame jokes and stupid tasks"" route. Give me a tough line, not some joke task that 8 year olds think is hilarious. I don't want a Jackass game, I want a Tony Hawk game. The skater customisation is non-existant, which is astounding considering that this is the 8th game, and supposedly the next-gen flagship. If you're new skating game player, then by all means, play this game. But if you're a fan of the Tony Hawk series, just get Tony Hawk 4 out again; it'll be a far better use of your time."
2,Rent it first...,"This game is fun at first, the graphics are really nice.After a while along with loads of frustrations and ridiculous missions and objectives this game loses its luster. Its really unrealistic for example, doing skateboard tricks while jumping out of an airplane. Also the slow-mo thing is really annoying especially for people who don't like to use the D-pad and prefer to use the Analog. The only skate game I'll possibly buy is EA's S.K.A.T.E because it focuses on the real side of skating."
2,With age somes boredom,"I have played and completed every Tony Hawk game, and I think I finally put away my skateboard and have moved on. There is nothing new in this game that you've never seen. The graphics are great, sure, but the gameplay gets boring quick and there isn't much incentive to play through this one unless you have some sick syndrome like me where you need every achievement point possible.Rental at best, it can be beat in 5 days if you burn through it. If your little brat has never played a TH game before he will be blown away. For veterans, stay away. Pick a new hobby like curling or women."
2,Not my type of game!,I never really got into skate board games but I keep trying them to see if I can find the fun that others do but I am never able to find the fun in them.
5,u got to check out Tony Hawks project 8,awesome very well made just the special can not work sometimes.
5,The Web of Ariosto,"This is a wonderful flight of fantasy that is full of magic castles, horses that fly (hippogriffs), and such imagination and humor that you never cease to be entertained by it all. You may wonder like I did that: If this is ""Part One"", where is part two? I was unable to find any such continuation. You have to just enjoy this marvelous tale for what it is."
4,textbook review,"As a former student of Dr. Middleton's, we used this textbook for our Human Sexuality anthropology course. The text is very concise, and filled with information. Students and general readers alike may find that reading it multiple times will bring more insight and information.It's a good reference in general, and is much cheaper and lighter than most textbooks out there!"
2,a poor job,"I had high hopes for this book, but was sorely disappointed. It was shoddily produced, with errors on practically every page, and contains several assertions (both ethnographic and methodological) that are just factually WRONG. I chose it for a course in Human Sexuality, and both I and the students regretted it. For a comparable book that is both more scholarly and more interesting, try Serena Nanda's ""Gender Diversity: Crosscultural Variations""."
4,"Wrong Color, but still ok for a boy!","This was a very nice watch, even if it was not Blue/Black and silver like the description says. Perfect for a 4 yr. old. A ""real"" watch, but still with a child friendly strap."
5,Great watch!,I ordered this for my son for Christmas and he just loved it!! It's a great watch for the price. He said it was his most favorite gift this year!! Yeah Mom!!!!!
4,Good entertainment,"Well, I've played twice and willing to continue playing....definitely for kids, but it's fun and easy to use....the story can be better as well as the map progression more detailed like the pirate ages....Overall very good for our children; fun to play with them."
5,funny and touching,"What a movie! Dudley moore is married to ann reinking for years and then falls for amy irving. when irving tells him she's pregnant he wants to divorce ann reinking. but when he plans to tell ann guess what she tells him? what's a guy to do? you actually feel for this guy because you know he loves both women even though he is a jerk for marrying both. i have loved this movie for years and watching in later in my 20's it gets better and more touching. of course this movie ends a little too nicely, but how else could they end it?? dudley moore amy irving and ann reinking are all great."
3,It's alright,"My aunt recommended to buy this shampoo after using it on her pup since it has helped her a lot. So I took a shot at it, and brought myself a bottle. So far, it's alright. I don't really get the point of it..."
5,A great addition,"I love wearing a flat top haircut. With the Flatopper, I can keep my hair looking sharp with very little effort at home. A flat top haircut needs to be maintained regularly. As a result, I purchased the Flatopper comb in the hopes of keeping barber shop visits to a minimum. I'm glad I took a chance because I have now, not only pro-rated the cost of the comb to the number of visits to the barber shop, but also saved money subsequently with every haircut I have now received. The spirit level inside the comb makes for fool-proof precision clipping and the wide comb surface means it takes very little time sitting down getting my hair cut."
3,Flattopper original with level,"Product is okay, does what it is supposed to do, but is not real big on quality versus what it costs... if you're not careful, you're hair dryer can heat the tines enough to warp them, okay for home use, I don't know as it is "" professional"" duty... there is a more expensive one which I assume is better, but again, pricey. I would just go with an extra large comb for a 2 or 3 bucks and forego the level."
1,The `Butt' of the Elvis Filmography,"If you want the primest footage of the posterior of the lovely Merry Anders, who appears in tight hot pants [about 7 years before such pants got into vogue} then get this film. Her plush, plumeflous backside is the only reason for the one star! Otherwise, this is one the dorks on Mystery Science Theater 3000 will never get a hold of, even though it's perfect for them, because Priscilla will never, ever let them!"
3,Purely for Elvis fans,"One of the more uncommon Elvis flicks, not much story line but it has some of Elvis's better 60's songs which all fans will appreciate. There are some good laughs and plenty of attractive women, especially the lovely Jocelyn Lane whom I believe is the prettiest co-star Elvis ever had -the video is worth it for her alone. The quality of the video is excellent. Overall delightful to watch and very enjoyable."
4,"Hey, it's Elvis and it's in color! Were you expecting ""West Side Story""?","A very funny film. The soundtrack was composed of old songs from earlier Elvis LPs (to keep the film's budget at a minimum). Elvis looks great and Jocelyn Lane looks incredible. In my opinion (along with many others), Jocelyn was the prettiest costar Elvis ever had. Julie Adams is very attractive as the ""older"" woman. Practically all of the women in the film are hot (and there are loads of groovy gals). In fact--although not intending to be--""Tickle Me"" remains one of the best children's pictures ever. I certainly couldn't get enough of it when it played at the local theater when I was in grade school. I went back to see it again five times! What can I say? Puberty calling! [filmfactsman]"
4,See Elvis take on the rodeo and robbers and a ghost house,"A rather underrated happy go lucky Elvis film from 1965. Songs better than normal as they were not written specifically for the movie, and had been recorded in the ealy sixties. Some of the sets a bit below par, but that was because the movie company was virtually bankrupt, (hence the reason for using previously recorded songs). The box office revenue saved the company for a few more years. The last 20 minutes is a real hoot and in places will make you jump as people move around the creepy deserted hotel. The partnership between Elvis and his sidekick is very amusing in places. OK so it's not Oscar material, but keep an open mind, and if your not an Elvis fan, you might be pleasantly surprised."
3,THE WOMEN ARE HOT!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT IS VERY FUN AND ENTERTAINING AND THE WOMEN ARE SO FINE IN THIS MOVIE ELVIS PRESLEY IS FUNNY AS EVER! THIS MOVIE IS JUST FOR LAUGHS NOT TO TAKE SERIOUSLY!
3,Blue eyed handsome man,"""Tickle Me"" remains one of the few Elvis pictures from the mid-60s which looks and sounds okay. Nothing great or startling here, just plenty of female flesh, a story of sorts about lost gold, complete with a haunted house, and some good, if recycled, songs.Elvis looks good as a rodeo rider trying to impress Jocelyn Lane, while getting into romantic trouble with an older woman. The setting for ""I'm Yours"" is nicely choreographed. A good film for the kids on a wet Saturday afternoon."
3,Uncomfortable handle,"Silicone bristles are nice and work very well. But, the arched handle is very uncomfortable. Suggest you buy the 10-Inch instead."
5,a mesmerizing glimpse into the re-invention of gotham city.,"This is a breathtaking journey through the creation of an animated classic. Including everything from production notes to episode listings to merchandising, this book is full of the obvious passion Bruce Timm and company poured into the making of this series. If you're a fan of Batman, or you just love animation in general, this is a not-to-be-missed treasure. Beautifully photographed and all-inclusive."
4,A MUST for any fan,"I grew up with Batman: The Animated Series. It introduced me to the world of Bruce Timm, one of my now favorites. This is a fantastic look at the series as a whole. Some great storyboards and character development sheets that you rarely get to see.I won't give it 5 stars, simply because the binding seems a little flimsy. Mine is still in good condition, but I worry that after a couple of reads, it may start to come apart. A hardcover copy would be nicer. But, that is my only complaint."
5,This a gorgeous book all fans of the show MUST have,"When I bought the book, I looked at the cover and thought it was a bit plain, dull even, but once I started to turn the pages I was awestruck with the amount of art presented so beautifully. Every page was loaded with the series' production material, insightful information, sharp images of characters/backgrounds, and even the title cards of BTAS episodes. You actually have to spend at least 5-10 minutes on each page JUST LOOKING at all the pictures. I was so grateful that the book was worth every dollar I spent on it."
5,Bruce Timm's Batman,What a visially stunning book. Bruce Timm's artwork is sensationally brought to the reader through Chip Kidds fantastic use of photo design. This book thoroughly examines the behind the scene design concepts of Bruce Timm and Paul Dino and company with insightful reading on how they got to create one of TV's best animated series. A valuable piece of work collecting wonderfully laid out illustrations. Highly recommended for the curious and pure fans of the Batman character.
5,Insight to a Classic,"Though some information I already knew, I found it to be very informative on the groundbreaking series. To know that guns, breaking glass and child endangerment weren't allowed when the show was on FOX KIDS (though I think each rule was broken at one point or another such as ""The Underdwellers"") Even the villain Firefly, though not as memorable as Joker or Mr. Freeze, wasn't allowed to be used on FOX because he was a pyromaniac. But on KIDS WB, it was like the flood gates were unleashed because there was child endangerment with the new Robin and Firefly made his debut."
2,Broke pretty quickly,"When I first got the camera, it made a rattling sound like there was something loose and just rolling around in there, but everything seemed to be working fine. Halfway through the first roll though, the shutter stopped working. I'm going to try to fix it later, but to most people it probably wouldn't seem worth the trouble.I also have the n8000 and have had no problems with it. If you're looking to buy a Nishika camera I would definitely recommend the n8000 over the n9000."
2,Disregard the Product Description,"Don't plan on using this camera to make 3D lenticular prints. This camera is 15 years old and printing not available. Buy it only as a curiousity.EDIT:Note that the above was written in 2007. Since then there have been lenticular printing service come and go. There may be services now, but plan to pay more than the camera is worth to get processing. Best use of the camera may be to scan your processed film and do what you want with it. This is the second camera from Nishika which they sold though multi-level marketing. The first camera (N8000) was a total joke with it's fake pentaprism, paper lcd screen, and a piece of lead int the bottom to give it heft.BTW, I've bumped my rating from one star, to two, but the N8000 still gets one star. If you are serious about 3d photography there are better choices."
4,Western set in New Zealand,"Rather ""stilted"" British version of the western...one would almost expect the dialogue to run along the lines 'I say old chap keep a stiff upper lip...."" with a rather grim ending..considering its age it hasn't weathered too badly..Glynnis Johns and Jack Hawkins are always a treat...the unintentional funny bit was the bosomy Ms. Laya Raki tastefully dressed in a grass skirt performing a 'Maori Dance' which to me remsembled a cross between Salome's Dance and that of a belly dancer...still not bad as entertainment if you are prepared to make allowances for the corny dialogue and unconvincing fight sequences....brave pioneers founding another portion of the British Empire while 'civilizing' the natives and then undoing the good work by not practicing what you preach by playing ""footsie"" with the chief's wife; which for the time when the film was made is rather startling"
3,Apalling but Addictive,"The plot of Overboard is almost too trite to repeat: he's a carpenter and she's a lady and she marries him anyway. Sort of. Before this can happen, she has to fall off her yacht and end up in an asylum with a case of amnesia and he has to rescue her and convince her that they are married and inculcate the ways of rude and rural countryfolk into her. You can probably guess the rest.What's surprising is that this is a lot of fun to watch. The stars themselves are very easy on the eyes and the chemistry between them is exactly like that of two happily married people. The scenery and the occasional dollops of music are pretty good too.If you have a thing for romantic comedies, you might like it. If, on the other hand, you just like stories about women falling off of boats, you should probably readSkinny Dipby Carl Hiaasen.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and the totally addictive bang BANG: A Novel"
2,even the kids use foul language!!!,"I don't remember the foul language in the movie from television. I've since been told by a friend that there is more than one version to DVD's and even music cd's.Even the children, the youngest on, took the Lord's name in vain!!I wished I'd have known before purchasing it because I would have passed it right up.I've been watching the ratings before I make a purchase now."
4,Actually I Loved the movie!,Goldie Hawn makes me laugh. I like movies that entertain and this one certainly is timeless. Dean Proffitt has an ulterior motive in rescuing rich Joanna Stayton from the psychiatric ward after she refuses to pay him for carpentery work he did on her yacht and ends up falling in love with her. They are from opposite ends of the financial spectrum without a hint of uniting. Fairy tale love if I ever saw it. My one disappointment is that there were no extra/deleted scenes to watch. Goldie and Kurt are the ultimate love sponges.
5,LOVE IT,"I love this movie. I watched it all the time growing up, on my Betamax. I quote the movie way too much and enjoy everything about it. if you havent seen this movie...WATCH It"
5,Sugarlips!,"I grew up watching this movie. My mom and i have been quoting lines from this movie since i was little.I just picked up another copy of this for myself(mom stole mine, ha). Had to watch this movie again when i bought it. Comedies are not made like this anymore. Everything ""funny"" nowadays is full of crude, dumb jokes. Dont get me wrong, cos i'm not old by any means, but i can only watch movies like wedding crashers or 40 year virgin so many times. Call me crazy if i can laugh at something other than sex jokes.Anyway, this movie is so charming and absolutely hilarious. I'm just wishing they'd clean up the grainy picture and put it on blu ray!I'd say this is easily one of my top 15 favorite movies of all time!(i like ALOT of movies)"
3,Goldie Almost Saves This,"If you liked the Steve Martin version of Cheaper By The Dozen, then this movie might be just the one for you. Goldie Hawn shows a good acting range going from self-centered idle rich to caring down-home wife and mother. The plot is pretty improbable and the transformation of the kids from all-out-brats to model children is even more so.The scenes move the movie right along and if you're waiting for the chocolate cream pie in the face, it's there. We had to laugh at some of the goofy things they put in. In general it was pretty predictable and not nearly as fun as her top movies."
4,gotta love Goldie Hawn,This movie is always funny. So much better feature length than cut for TV. Great chemistry between Goldie and Kurt. One of my favorites.
5,Adorable movie!,"Totally entertaining. Heartwarming and funny, and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are simply magical together. I enjoyed every minute and even applauded at the end."
2,Aweful Blu-ray quailty!,"One of my favorite films, but the quality of the BLU-RAY is a joke, it wasn't even that grainy on my regular DVD. Just buy the original DVD instead of paying the extra, since it really isn't a feature."
3,Disappointing Quality Blu-Ray,"One of my favourite films so I was eager to see in all it's Blu-Ray glory.However, as reported by others, picture is grainy, funny contrast levels and in some scenes you can see a herringbone effect.DTS-MA Stereo sound is pretty good.Only extras are the theatrical trailer and scene selection."
3,It's Ok.,"Viewed: 3/06Rate: 53/06: Overboard is a fairly average film while portraying egregious messages. The usual convention is that, in the end, Dean Proffitt, played by Kurt Russell, would have been arrested for kidnapping and other more serious offenses. So, I'll have to suspend my disbelief this time. The film is more of a drama than a comedy, and Overboard isn't too bad in its pacing as it flows nicely. There isn't anything wrong with acting, but there is a lot wrong with the poorly attempted gag jokes throughout the film. Cutting them out, Overboard would simply have been better. The movie wasn't that funny as I hoped it would be, but more or less, I enjoyed Overboard to a certain extent."
4,That 'Elk Snout Mountain Man' is sweating all over the place,"I'm not going to give it 5 stars, but it rightfully deserves 3 1/2 to 4 stars. This is not a classic, but definitely a good film."
3,"Ok Movie, DVD Has No Extras","This is a good movie to rent, but if you are looking for the DVD to contain some extras to add to the value, there are none. I found the picture and sound to be no better than VHS."
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH,"In the late 80s' there were a lot of comedies that came out, they have all now made their way to cable t.v. as a staple on TNT.Overboard was just on today, and i watched it. I did see it back when it came out, and I thought it was a funny romantic/comedy. WEll, after viewing it in the present day, I found it to be quite dull.Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are both good actors. I just thought the story -- her being a rich uptight brat who falls ""overboard"" and his poor, single dad character uses her to get back at her for not paying him for the job he did.It's just so darn predictable. I did, however, notice one of the sons were played by kids who were in other movies. One of them was in Big, as Josh's best friend. Just a little tidbit of useless information for you.I don't recommend this movie, it's boring."
2,Yuck.,Couldn't give it a one star rating because of a couple of cute scenes that rescue it from the absolute bottom of the barrel... that said it's still a bad movie.
2,Not funny at all,"I found Overboard to not be the least bit funny. I don't see how they can classify it as being a comedy. It is just another run-of-the-mill ""comedy"" that is boring and not funny at all. The movie is very predictable throughout the whole film. The premise is good but the way the director and the cast carry out with it is horrible. Kurt Russel is trying to play a different role in this movie and I think he should just stick with his usual. Goldie Hawn does the best that she can with her role but I don't think anybody could make it great. Overall Overboard is a senseless, predictable movie with failed humor. 2 Stars"
4,Overview,This DVD arrived in a timely manner and was new as said. The contents of movie was funny without being vulgar (which is hard to find at times) I bought this for my daughters stocking at Christmas and she loved it!
5,"Old and silly, but still pretty fun.","This ludicrous comedy starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn is great. Wealthy and thoroughly unpleasant heiress Joanna Stayton (Hawn) suffers from severe amnesia and the carpenter she stiffs out of 600 bucks, Dean Proffitt (Russell), takes advantage of the situation to take her home to his seedy hovel and 4 unruly kids. There he convinces her that she's his wife, with the ensuing misadventures as amusing as you'd expect. Throughout the movie they fall madly in love (of course), and Proffitt is then left with the unenviable task of explaining his actions to his lovely guest when her memory eventually returns.It's a the hokiest, silliest movie that you'll ever love, with both Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell turning in great performances. Laughs are just about guaranteed, and it's one of those movies that just gets better with repeated showings. Reccomended."
5,I fell in love with Goldie Hawn!,"She is awesome... Goldie was fabulous. Kurt was her straight man. Oh..Boy they had oodles of chemistry. Loved all the supporting cast.This is one intelligent comedy. Its for the ages with repeatable factor. I can watch this movie again and again and like many I do.If you have not seen it, don't rent. Buy it. You will want to watch it multiple times.THIS IS A CLASSICPut it out on Blue Ray MGM! What are you waiting for?"
5,Overboard,Good wholesome movie. Some cuss words not to my liking but overall a fun movie for the entire family. We have seen it many times and never get tired of it. And the final scence is always anticipated.
4,Fun but predictable.,"Overboard starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell is an enjoyable film I watched relentlessy when I was young but seeing this romantic comedy well it's kinda average now. Directed Garry Marshall, Overboard tells the story of a wealthy, spoiled socialite who has it all but real and honest happiness. She never admits to herself she is silently suffering 'til she meets a carpenter who forever changes her life. I won't give away too much but Overboard has some great and funny moments but overall this film does get on your nerves after you've seen it 10,000 times. Overboard is a fantastic guilty pleasure so treasure this one in secret."
3,A Fun Movie,My wifeand I felt that this was a cute movie with some good laughs and has a happy ending as well.
5,Comfort movie,"Great movie that is comfort viewing for my wife. As our VHS version was borrowed and also old, it was time to upgrade."
3,Blu Ray transfer poor - Movie good,"Overboard is a favorite movie and we pre-ordered the Blu Ray version. The transfer is poor - noticeable grain, inconsistent contrast... wait for a remake if you can."
2,overboard,"The visual quality is so fuzzy and very poor. If I knew the picture was going to be that bad, I never would have bought it."
4,A great movie just for laughs.,"This movie would not be considered a classic, but if you are in the mood for a fun movie with a very likable cast this is the one for you. Goldie Hawn is enchanting in her duel roles, and Kurt Russel is a riot as her foe (and later sweatheart). This movie never fails to bring a smile to my face, and is one worth owning."
4,Enjoyed the movie,"I rented this online. I had seen it before, but many years ago. The movie played without hitch, and it brought back memories (good ones) of watching it before. Good laughs!"
2,not playable on Windows XP,"I was able to install the game on Windows XP Home SP3 by doing the following: (for disc 1)It says it needs Windows 95.1. Go to CD.2. Right click on the setup.exe3. Choose properties.4. Go to the compatibility tab.5. Check the compatibility mode checkbox and select Windows 95.6. Click OK.7. Double-click setup.exe and the game installs just fine.After the game installs, right click on the game shortcut and follow #3-6 above.Disc 2 won't install if you try the above method. Disc 2 is only a video (not part of the game). If you want to see the video, then go to youtube and search for VTS4vrpRwgc.To see the controls when you are playing the game, hit the F1 key.I was able to start the first mission and go to the first 2 waypoints. But when I complete the second waypoint and proceed to the third waypoint, the game freezes.

1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This book has taken photo after photo straight out of the Ikea catalogue! Obviously, the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to Ikea's design and storage ideas. This book actually put me in a bad mood. Listen up folks, THE IKEA CATALOGUE IS FREE. Do yourselves a favour and pick one up, because none of these so-called ""organization"" books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local Ikea store. These authors should be fired. Shame on both of them."
1,Tell me something I don't already know,"This is basically a book of few words, many uninspiring photographs, and a some weak hints here and there that reveal to you the astonishing secret of clutter-free living: just buy a bunch of cute and clever containers to store all your junk! There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free."
5,And I thought I was organized....,"This book was given to me by a friend and I brought it with me to the Bahamas this winter along with lots of other reading material. Family had been visiting for a week (left) and I was ready to curl up with something really good...and this was it. I read it cover to cover without stopping. The great ideas, the snappy writing, the option that I didn't have to spend big bucks to make major improvements...there is something in it for everyone. I just got through going through a relative's house where she was a hoarder and had lived in the same house for 30 years. I think this book could have even made a difference there. So, I would think that anyone interested in less clutter, and how to go about making it happen would enjoy what Koll & Ellis have to say."
4,Born organized,"I'm already a very organized/neat person, but even I could use this book! It's perfect for anyone who wants to clean up, redecorate, and get organized...even for people who are neat, but could use some helpful, hip, and classy ideas. I'm sure the ""Queer Eye"" guys would approve of this book as well! I think the only thing that's lacking is 'before and after' pictures (thus, 4 stars rather than 5). Buy it, love it, live it and be organized!"
1,Please don't buy this book.,Randall is a designer in San Francisco. He ripped me off for $3900 after ordering a custom sofa to be made. I haven't heard from him in a year. Please don't buy his book or hire him as a designer. You can check the City of SF to see that he has judgements against him.
2,Just wait.,Just wait for the dvd of this title to come out. It will have subtitled japanese. If you can stand the horrible BGM and voice acting and the changed dialogue then buy it.
1,Wait for the DVD,Face it people..... Funimation will never get better. The voices are terrible and the BGM is atrocious. Wait for the DVD with the original japanese version and stop wasting your money on the tapes.
3,An ok movie,"I, personally, love DBZ and have seen many of the episodes. When i heard of this movie, i had to see it. When i finally did, it was a bit of a disappointment for my DBZ standards. I was expecting alot more action and the story to be a little more played out. The fact that it is only approx. 45min, doesn't really let the story develop as much as i had hoped. Even with this judgement i still like the movie quite alot. So for these reasons i give this movie a 3 out of 5 star rating."
3,"DBZ Fan Buy, DVD Fan Don't Buy","If your a fan of the dbz series then buy this dvd. It offers the original jap uncut and english dubbed version. But if your a dvd person who likes ultimate quality stay away at all costs. It is just vhs on a disc. Nothing else. Even the extras (are awful), nuthing but commercials. Happy buying."
5,The future that never was....,"This is a very sad movie but also exciting. The only thing that is wrong with it is that they make the beginning part where Goku dies way too short, but still, I did cry. I cried when....well I'm not going to give the whole story away. But if you are a true DBZ fan, your gonna want to see this movie. It's a must-see movie. The History of Trunks: The future that never was...."
5,"A must see, to understand Trunks","This is a very useful special to fully understand who trunks is and why he keeps saying ""Never underestimate the androids"" ill leave the exciting parts out. Just remember that this is the alternate future. I will definately buy this when its out, i suggest you all do too...even if you dont go through website."
1,"Immature, unrealistic, violent, bloody, eeeeew.","Why do you suppose I don't have any business watching TV? Because there's too much in the way of violence promotion. This overrated garbage is no exception. I really tried to enjoy it, but the violent scenes in which Goku is getting savagely beat up by Vegeta are wicked and at times bloody. No wonder it's become so popular in America! Pokémon isn't that violent, but who wants to spend even a half-hour of her time watching stuff that only feeds the eyes and not the brain?"
4,An Era of Darkness,"Goku, the Earth's mighty hero, dies of a heart diease and things get to bad to worse pretty fast. The only Z fighters left are Gohan, son of Goku, and Trunks, son of Vegeta. Gohan fights the androids with Trunks help. In the middle of the TV Special, Gohan dies and Trunks goes Super Saiyan. However, being a Super Saiyan doesn't help Trunks defear the two demented androids bent on world destruction. Bulma (Trunks's Mom) invents a time machine in hopes to prevent the death of Goku. Trunks goes to the past and makes short work of Freiza and his father King Cold."
3,I almost cried!,"This movie is so dramatic! All the Z fighters are killed by the androids except for Gohan and Trunks. Gohan dies later on and Trunks goes super sayian and still can't beat the androids! His power level as a young adult is 4,000,000 and he almost gets killed. The thing that pisses me off is that Gohan dies but it was cool when he had only arm. He had only one arm and he was still whupping on the androids! The movie is okay but I wouldn't reccomend buying it."
4,Really good for English,The history of trunks was really good It is the best english dubb I have seen the voices have really evolved and the animation looks new and cool even though some dbz fans that have been watching a little too much would say the japanese version is better the only difference is in culture aint nothing wrong with this movie get it!!
1,Where is Jeopardy?,"I just bought a second hand copy of this. The case said ""Jeopardy, Second Edition,"" the disc said ""Jeopardy, Second Edition,""so why am I actually playing ""The Emperor's New Groove?"""
3,This Is Very Hard If You Want Better Game Shows,Than Buy The Weekest Link Family Feud Wheel Of Fortone Second Edcion And Family Feud
4,"good, not great.","useful, succinct guide to Naples and the nearby coast. Good info on the major museums and some of the lesser ones. Nice guide to street scenes, transport, even food. But I suspect how up to date the information is when the guide advises you to tip 200 lire in the restrooms--the lire not having been in use for 12 years.But it does fit in your pocket."
5,Nattokinase instead of prescription drugs like Plavix,"My homeopath recommended I use Nattokinase along with a 1/2 dose of my Plavix after I experienced two heart attacks. I don't have any scientific evidence (lab results)yet of it's effectivess, but when I do, I'll publish my results. However, I have had no more heart symptoms since starting this product. Would love to hear from others with more experience with this product too!"
3,"Fun, but lacking.","Perhaps I was tainted by the job Hasbro Interactive did with Pong, but this just seemed to lack something. It was fun, but I wasn't left with the same sense of awe mixed with nostalgia that Pong left me with. It also was a bit too easy... I managed to complete almost all of the game in one gaming session. Over all, not a bad job, ...."
2,Needs an editor,"I love Cynthia Ozick's writing and although there are bursts of brilliance, I found this book largely unreadable."
3,"Inseem is more like 32""","Pants are a little too baggy, though that is a preference issue. I had to have these hemmed due to the unexpected length. I wouldn't wear them hiking, but they're great for fishing and kayaking."
3,Not so bad,I wonder why so many people hate this album. OK it is not the kind of record you would have thought that a serious rock musician like Keith Moon should have done. It is done in a very camp english way. OK he is horrible as a singer but I still think there are some endearing moments here. Maybe it is not the album worthy of a double extended version treatment.
1,Who Cares?,"Facetious, self indulgent and virtually impossible to listen to. As the liner notes point out, it was a time of solo albums. That trapped the great sideman, Keith Moon, in a frontman's body, and it wasn't a good fit. Some engineers and marketing people took his money. Ringo Starr came along to jam and groove along. There are up to five versions of some songs on this 50-song, two-CD set, and there's no good reason for that.If you think Keith Moon could do no wrong, then you'll find nothing wrong with this record. If you have the patience to identify your favorite versions of the included songs and produce your own disc with just those versions and none of the extraneous studio banter, you'll have a more or less decent product. If neither of those scenarios describes you, then buy an anthology of The Who and remember how great a player Keith Moon was with that most powerful and precise of British rock bands."
1,Why???,"Why re-release this travesity. I loved Keith Moon - as a drummer - but this is just plain bad. I still have the vinyl version and never listen to it. Maybe the extras are worth it, but I would never pay for this thing new."
3,"Worth reading, but there are better Doc books out there.","If you're interested in the life of Doc Holliday, than you will probably want to read this book.It is definitely filled with some historical truths, but at the same time the author tries to tell the reader what Doc might have been feeling when relating things that happened to him. I found that to be slightly annoying, because it's just based on pure conjecture. Sometimes it seems more like a fictional story rather than factual information.It also seems like more information could have been put into the book regarding the relationships between him and Kate and him and Wyatt Earp.All in all a worthwile book, but one not too put too much credence into. ""Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait,"" by Karen Holliday Tanner is a better choice for the Doc Holliday fan. It has a good deal more factual information information about Doc, and much of it is based on family records, letters, etc."
3,Poor writing,"While the subject of the book is indeed interesting, the author is not the best writer I've ever read. It's as if she thought she were going to be paid by the word and truly goes overboard with her descriptions. She writes from Doc Holliday's point of view, which I find extremely irritating. I'd much rather she just tell the story of his life rather than try to figure out what he was thinking. My advice is to choose a different title and different author."
1,Low Quality,"My car has gone through 2 of these alternators. Besides having to pay for the alternator, on each occasions I had to pay about $200 for the installations. Apparently, this thing is only good for a few weeks. I'm so disappointed that I refused to obtain a third one, even if it were under warranty. Instead, I paid for a GOOD part from a NAPA repair shop, and although it set me back about $650.00, I have a warranty on both the part and the labor. Never buying auto parts from amazon again.The only good thing about this product is that it fits."
5,Fun,I played with this for hours before giving it to my girlfriend. Mad fun. Gets a bit hot in there though
4,Great compilation workout will get you sweating,"Both the upper and lower workouts in this DVD will get your heart rate going and the sweat flowing.The snippets of workouts are from various other tapes that Billy has already produced, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. With a lot of the snippets coming from ""Get Ripped"" and ""Live"". I own both of those series so it was a little disappointing to be seeing the same routines, however, it did give me assurance that both of those series are a great workout.The leg workout is a killer while the upper body will leave your arms and shoulders screaming for aspirin.Overall a great addition to my ever growing library of Taebo!"
2,Inconsistent editing affects workout quality,"This tape was a bit of a disappointment to me. I've been doing Tae-Bo since the beginning (remember the motivating info-mercials?) As my wedding was approaching I wanted to kick it up a notch from the original Basic and 8-minutes workouts that I've been doing for so long. After reading all the reviews from this website, I chose this DVD. Having now tried to use it several times, I am most disappointed by the editing- there are several exericises that are performed on one side of the body but then not repeated for the other. The editing is also choppy enough that it interrupts the energy and flow you can build during a workout. It is disappointing enough that I am now trying to find an alternative DVD, or even a copy of the original ""Advanced"" workout. Hope this helps!"
5,Love this dvd,"I bought this dvd to complement my Advanced ""Get Ripped"" series-it sounded good to be able to focus primarily on one body part at a time for greater results. I did the Upper Body workout yesterday & my back & arms are literally screaming for mercy today! This really took it to the next level- I'm looking forward to doing the Lower body workout soon. I can see how this would shape & tone up your body quickly! I've been doing Taebo exclusively since the end of May and my weight loss & muscle tone are impressive. I highly recommend these!"
5,"If you like the Who, the Jam ...","If you like the Who, the Jam ... or even the Smiths in some respects, you should try this music.I cannot stop listening to this CD, and I don't do that often. A stack of music comes and goes from my office every month. It's a big part of my job, but I cannot listen to much of it and do my work. Ironic, I know. The cover of this CD caught my attention ~ [side-note: it looks like the same photographer over the course of their previous releases]This is not simple pop. The songs are crafted and well-written ~ they build and turn unexpectedly. Strong tracks to sample: Your Urge; Books From Boxes and the lead track, Girls Who Play Guitar."
3,Stick with A Certain Trigger,"I was blown away by Maximo Park's first album, A Certain Trigger, when I bought it last year. It was the best BritPop I'd heard since What's the Story Morning Glory, so I bought the other 2 albums a few weeks ago. Each one was a little bit more disappointing than the last. Less energy, less distinctive. Bummer, because A Certain Trigger really rocks."
3,Uneven release from MP,"Maximo Park is one of the most talented bands out there, no question. Unfortunately, while ""Our Earthly Pleasures"" is a decent enough album, it never really gets beyond average. Maximo Park has some great stuff, but they tend to suffer from getting too art-rocky at times and Paul Smith's vocals being a bit on the droning side. This record is a good example of that. Basically, I pretty much agree with Hercules...Doh's take on the band. Spot on."
4,funny,This is a funny movie were Goku and Piccolo learn to drive! If you are collecting all tapes i recomend it or if you want a funny tape get this one. IF you want a tape with fighting in it i sugest a tape from the sayian saga!!!!
4,Pretty good.,"This tape was good, but it only has 2 episodes. Though it does have the Histroy of Dragonball Z that tells what happened up until now. I hope everyone trains well because it doesn't help at all."
3,"Ahhhh, It's Okay.","The only reason I got this tape is because I wanted to finish off my Trunks Collection, though it had nothin to do with the other episodes. All they do basically is train, and Goku and Piccolo learn how to drive. I wouldn't really recommend this tape to anyone, but its an okay tape."
4,Prepare for the future,"To tell you the truth there are other tapes I would rather get then this. Unless you collect all the dbz tapes, I recommend you just watch these episodes on cartoon network. All they do is train. The last episode Goku and Piccolo drive. Not as good as I hoped. It is not that bad, but I'm just saying don't get this unless you like getting all the tapes."
4,this tape only has 2 episodes!,This is the first dbz tape with only 2 epasodes thay are prity good thou.
2,Don't waste your money,"Anyone interested in the whole Dragonball Z scene can do without watching these episodes. They had nothing to do with the previous Trunks episodes, and the future Android saga. They were clearly meant to be funny, but I did not find them humreous. Just another attempt for Funimation to obtain more money from poor unsuspecting DBZ fans."
4,had one before: YUP just like I remembered,"Used to have one twenty years ago and loved it. Found another one and gonna hook it up later. Let u know. Lets see if it still pushes good sound like back in the days.Whatitdo folks I'm back. Yup just like I remembered, this takes music in you're car to a whole nother level. I got this installed and not only do I have the settings in my deck but I have the control to tweek the settings in my deck. Bass pounds with no distortion my mids & highs I set the frequency in the deck and make adjustments with the equalizer. Love it! If you can find one I'm telling you it works! Dueces folks!"
4,Update on purchase,"I feel I had to edit my review, because even though it doesn't have the tabs, it really isn't a problem and my mom loves it. She can't stop thanking my for it, and says the other residents at the Assisted Living all want to know where she got it. The bag is the right size, and doesn't hit her knees like I thought it would. It really is helpful for her, and I wanted to set the record straight :-)Buyer Beware: the picture of this walker bag on all Ableware photos show attaching straps to hold the bag in place from the sides. This prevents the bag from falling back and hitting the person with the walker in the knees. This bag does NOT come with these attachments. The only reason I bought this bag was because of these additional straps. Very cheesy of the seller to inply this is a part of the bag. Not so."
5,Probably the most outstanding book on early California ever written.....,"I can't agree more with the other reviewer who has commented on this book. I also found it accidentally (while looking for books written by James D. Houston), and I also am buying extra copies to give as gifts.The writing here is majestic, magical, and extremely powerful (yet simple and elegant at the same time). You will learn more about the California of the mid-1800s, by reading this book, than you will probably learn anywhere else. The author was a truly gifted writer, and his expressive and detailed language regarding California life at the time of the gold rush, will enthrall and deeply impact you.One other point! The quality of this printing is exceptional, and adds greatly to the text itself. This book is an awesome deal, given Amazon's pricing and availability."
4,Something to chill to.,"I saw Otis in Franklin In. one night and to my suprise I hate country music but he put on a good show and I loved the set he did, if you like a solo acoustic singer just coming from his own heart check this out and something else I would recomend is hank williams the 3rd."
5,Hilarious fun for all ages,"I got this game as a Christmas gift for my eight year old daughter. She loves the characters and the silly sound effects. The cars were pretty easy for her to control after she got the feel of it. She has played it over and over and never gets tired of it. It really is a fun game for her, and my husband. My four and a half year old niece visited, and she was even getting the hang of it."
2,"5 stars for Dandy Kenny, but subject matter is passe'","Reading some of the reviews makes me wonder, why bunch of poor, abused, conquered by force and tyranny, fighting a ruthless modern army for their homes and families are called rebels, savages and other Raj era slang, and they probably still judge human beings by the content of Melanin in their system and/or how rich their family is, and whom or what they worship. I have to apologise to the late Kenneth More, who proved that one doesn't have to be Upper Claaas, to win all. Also the action is good for the time of filming."
4,Fast & Fun,"As a Lauren Bacall fan, I found ""Flame Over India"" immensely enjoyable. A reviewer once called it one of her best performances and I agree. As Catherine Wyatt, widow of a doctor and governess of a young prince in early-twentieth-century India, Bacall crackles and pops, assisted by a sturdy cast including British actor Kenneth More as Army Captain Scott, the man charged with bringing the young prince to safety in the midst of religious warfare. Filled with adventure, along with a sprinkling of funny moments, ""Flame Over India"" is a fun watch."
4,Great picture,"Set in 1905, this movie portrays the adventures of a group of westerners attempting to escape an Indian city under seige by Muslim insurgents. They have a young prince with them, who is the key to keeping one of the kingdoms aligned to the British Empire.The movie is fun and reminds me of the British films I used to watch in Alaska when I was a kid (for some reason we always got English movies set in the jungle or the desert). The players in North West Frontier did an excellent job (led by Bacall), and this was as true for the leads as it was for the supporting cast. As far as the writing was concerned, there was quite a bit of plot twists and other devices (including a potential traitor!) and it made for great entertainment. Historically it seemed like a realistic portrayal of life in India at the beginning of the 20th C., although this is not an area of emphasis for me."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"Beikircher has recorded a disc of Faure's violin music that I've really enjoyed. His Schumann isn't quite as good. Intonation isn't flawless in the most difficult passages and his sound is sometimes scratchy and unmusical. Also, his breathing noises are a distraction here, unlike on the Faure disc."
4,Spencer Davis Group - 'The Masters' (Cleopatra) 2-CD,"Total of 40 songs and one vintage interview clip makes this release worthwhile.One thing you might want to keep in mind,is that Steve Winwood isn't on here.I thought I heard him on maybe like three songs on disc one,but I'm not sure.Very nice compilation of SDG's repertoire of pure British Invasion blues rock.Most of the cuts here are at least good if not near excellent.Tracks I got the most out of are ""Let's Have A Party"",""I'm A Man"",""Gimme Some Lovin'"",""Mr.Operator"",""Sure Need A Helping Hand"",the foot stomping ""Mr.Second Class"",""Feel Your Way"",""Stop Me I'm Falling"" and ""Morning Sun"".Duration of 2 1/2 hours.Comes with 8-page booklet with photos and liner notes.Line-up:Spencer Davis-guitar&vocals,Eddie Hardin-keyboard&vocals,Ray Fenwick-guitar,Charlie McCracken-bass and Pete York-drums(who's recently reuinted with Davis).A nice choice,would make a good gift."
5,Very good,"They Book Is Great For People Who Like Horses And A Good Myistery.Ghost Horse 1), Hunted Trail 2) And Ghost Vision 3) Aer The Books In the Seris So Dont Miss Out...Speacil Order For All Of Them..."
5,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!!!,I loved this book! I couldn't put it down until I had read it as many times as I could. The plot was great. This was one of the top 3 books I have ever read. (The other 2 are THE HAUNTED TRAIL #2 and GHOST VISION #3)
1,Kensington lasted 10 months with light usage,"I bought the Kensington headphone ten months ago; with usage of one or two days a week they are now unusable. I think that the line at the plug end failed inside. In any event, the cheaper Coby headphone I bought at the same time still works as expected; the Kensington pair is now in the garbage."
3,fair but lacking,"I bought these headsets for my computer,although they feel and sound fine,I was really looking for a headset that had its own volume control,and these does not.That was a major dissappoint me for me, but they were insxpensive, so you get what you pay for, though I have bought cheaper, with their own volume control."
2,Just Passable,I did not expect a lot from these headphones for the price and they just barely lived up to that. The sound started out a little scratchy. After three weeks only one side of the headphones has any sound.I only use these for sound while I'm on the treadmill so they are OK. If you have any use beyond that I could not recommend them.
2,"Went cheap, but paid a price anyway!","I decided to get a backup pair of headphones mainly for travelling so i would'nt have to take my good pair all the time. I was mainly drawn to these because of the price. Let me say first of all that the sound quality on these were ok. The aesthetics were pleasing. However, the padding around the ear was almost none existent. But the worst part, it felt like head was in a vice!! The pressure n my ear was just too uncomfortable for me to reccommend this product. Pass."
5,Fast arrival,"The product came fast, and was exactly what I ordered. The price was right too. The waist is tight on my husband and as a result they have worn fast. So just make sure you order the correct size. My husband is more like a 38"" but insists I do not get him anything but a 36."
3,I hope you can wait,The jeans are great. I have been wearing these for the better part of 10 years in the mechanical field. The problem I have is they showed in stock and ordered though prime membership. Instead of 2 days it was 2 weeks before they shipped. I would suggest another retailer.
3,Too tall in the waist,"These fit unfortunately like most of the Carhart's I have tried. Either you have to pull them way up over your belly, or there is a droop below the zipper where you could hide a small squirrel. I love the heavy fabric and their durability, but someone in the design department needs to try a pair on. Even though my man boobs are growing, I don't want to start pulling my work pants up that high. If you are a skinny guy with a tall waist, these are for you. They will last a long time."
3,Look nice,"The jeans are just what I expected. I think they will serve the purpose for which I bought them. I only wish these jean companies would make more jeans in the 28"" length. My husband is short and his jeans are always dragging. If he rolls them up the cuffs end up full of dirt. I am not a tailor...can't sow."
5,Great slacks!,"My husband only wears the B73 Logger pants in the winter as he works outside a lot and they help to keep him warmer without adding extra layers. The only problem I have is that the slacks seem to tear out at the rivited areas. Not sure if it is because he is so hard on them or if there is a problem, but either way - they make him happy so I am happy!"
5,Good price - Quality cable,This cable performs as good or better than higher priced VGA cables. I have not observed any degradation of display quality.This cable is used to display PowerPoint presentations for a church. The projector is ceiling mounted approximately 65-feet from the accompanying workstation.Highly recommended for the price and quality.
5,Great and LOOOONG VGA cable at a great price,"Great VGA cable! No ghosting, clear signal - as if the monitor was attached with a standard 6' cable.With this cable, I was able to do a drop/install from my mom's camera server to a camera monitor in her office. Amazon had the cheapest price I found for a cable at this length on the net. As usual for Amazon, fast turnaround - I received the cable in two days from when I placed the order."
2,Not quite what I had hoped for...,"As you can see from the title, this book was not quite what I had hoped for. As someone who is reentering the arena of model building, it was quite a disappointment.The overall cover is nice, and there are a few color pictures. However, most of the pictures are in black and white. This obscures any detail that may be gained from them. Even the color pictures are of less quality than can be found on the internet sites.The text is fairly simplistic and lacks any real detail. It does not provide any real pivotal insight in how to construct, paint and accurize a Star Trek model. Worse yet, it stays away from the most common, main stream models, sticking to mostly obscure and less common models.Overall this book was really a disappointment. I would only recommend it, if the model you are building is contained within it, and only then to a true beginner."
2,Only for a complete novice,"The book details building of a few Star Trek models. Most of the advice is pretty basic, and feels more like author's modeling journal than manual designed to learn from. Choice of Star Trek models also seems a bit coincidental - I think this book would have been just as good or bad if other Sci-Fi models were shown.Several topics are beyond what I'd consider beginner's subjects: one model is build from a vacuum-formed kit, another with lighting. At the end Borg cube is made from scratch, with pieces being replicated in resin. Despite this, it really doesn't feel like there is a lot of useful advice given.Overall I think it's a good book for a beginner, but not much more."
4,"works well, easy to install","I replaced both the RH & LH OEM mirrors on my '02 Tahoe with this mirror after they were damaged. It was easy to intall and works great. Pop off cover on the iside of the door, remove three nuts, unplug harness and replace in opposite order. Took me 10 minutes. It is a very inexpensive option to a dealer mirror. This mirror is not heated, hence the cheaper price, but it has the curb light and does the job for the money."
2,Misrepresentation,"I had been looking at this on the Sears site and there were two of them in the set. I come here and find the same set apparently but for less money. Well, I guess not since all I received was the red one when I ordered. If you are going to put an image on here of the product make sure it is represented correctly."
2,"Not bad, takes up space","Not bad unit, however it does take up a lot of surface space in a tool drawer. I'm not sure if I like it that much. I guess now I have to make it work. I purchased the green and red metric and standard. Some sockets do not fit the space because the thickness of the socket wall and the length."
4,Almost 3 stars,"The larger size deep sockets are too heavy for these magnets butit still gets the job done of keeping the sockets organized inside my tool bag.I tried walking from my shop out to the work site with holder in hand & 5 steps outthe 3 larger deep sockets went on their own excursion, I recovered all 3 sockets.The price & quality of construction earned this holder the 4th star.The additional magnetic strips on the underside keep the holder from slidingaround in my tool box and secured to the side of the box when needed.Stronger magnets would have put this item in the 5 star category in my opinion."
2,So-so,"I wouldn't buy any more of these. It's hit and miss when it comes to putting sockets in them. Not all of them fit in order, and the holder takes up lots of space in a tool drawer."
4,Good but pricey,"I purchased this to keep my sockets organized in a tool drawer, but it securely holds them when I need toss the entire tray in a tool bag to work in a more remote location. Good quality, but it seems the price for `plastic and magnets' could be a little more reasonable..."
3,"it's like junk food, bad for ya, but tastes good.","after reading all the hype about VERSUS another asian horror movie that borrows heavily from american cinema/concepts, i was hugely disapointed, but when i rented JUNK from my video storei actually had a good time watching this schlocker, junk blatently rips off ideas from famed directors; romero (day of he dead) lucio fulci of ZOMBIE. (hell, even some of the music sounds excatly like ZOMBIE 3)but nonetheless isn't bad for a cheesy c-movie. the zombies were more ""convincing"" than paul anderson's disapointing adaptation of resident evil. JUNK doesn't take itself too seriously either, the violence is over-the-top cartoonish regardless of the gory bits and the comic reliefs actually had me rotf.props to this ambtious director,with a bigger budget and more originality he may be the next john carpenter or romero(at least in japan.) (0="
3,GOOD ZOMBIE MOVIE !,"""JUNK"" is a fun new zombie flick! Its not a masterpiece but its very goofy & bloody & its better than alot of other zombie flops. Its well worth a look see!"
1,The name says it all.,The movie is called Junk and that's what it really is junk.This is probably one of worst zombie flicks i've ever seen.
1,5 Stars For This Powerful Raw Recording of a Great 80's Band - Negative 4 Stars For The Independent Sellers,"I have listened to all of these tracks. They are unrefined, gritty, and fantastic. I saw these guys perform live around the time this recording was made. They were great. This recording captures the essence of the band. I recommend buying it.But not for 50 dollars. What a rip off! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy from these independent seller clowns. I just purchased this CD for 18 bucks on an independent seller website. It's easy to find merely by doing a google search.Let the buyer beware!Update: A couple of days ago I talked to the vender who sold me this CD. He said that he's a good friend of one of the band members. He also said that they plan on doing another pressing of this CD. So save some bucks and wait just a little longer."
4,"""The arrival of one of the coolest villains ever...Cell!""","Imperfect Cell - Encounter is a great addition to the DBZ family. I only gave it four starts because it is some-what boring before Cell appears, but mysterious all the same. Piccolo and Kami finally fuse, bringing out the true, stronger Piccolo, but not evil. Cell is really creepy, the way he sucks the life out of anyone who crosses him to gain energy, and he even can perform Goku's special move -- the Kamehameha wave! Buy Encounter to both complete your collection and delive true DBZ entertainment to your home!"
4,The Beginning of a Very Nasty Fight,"I should clarify this by stating that I have seen only the Japanese version, not the English, and so can only give this four star as I don't know what will be done in the dubbing process. However, if Funimation dubs these episodes well, upgrade my rating to five stars. You will see the creation of the new Piccolo, a Piccolo that for a while is stronger than anyone else and gives a very big beating to Cell. Piccolo will look like he's in big trouble, but Piccolo always has a plan... One thing will keep this video from attaining true classic DBZ status. Join me in hoping as fervently as you know how that Cell gets a good voice! Not a crummy lady-from-an-anticigarette-ad voice like Frieza got, but a good voice!"
3,IF I HAD KNOWN...,"The headphones are great, nice bass sound, nice fidelity, but the transmiter did damage an hour after the first use."
1,Couldn't get them to work,"Horrible experience. Bought these for kids video in the car. The only sound I got from these things were feedback, screeching. I could faintly hear the movies in the background, but the screeching was so loud you couldn't make out the dialog nor would you be able to tolerate the headphones for more than 15 seconds.I even went to an audio shop to have them install it. They tried and got same results even with noise filter. Bought a second pair, thinking 1st was defect= same thing. Ended up buying RF headphones and they worked OOTB 1st try!!Would give 0 stars but it won't let you."
3,"Little Fan, Big Air","My dad uses this fan A LOT and LOVES it. I can see why: It kicks out a lot of air. I borrowed it this summer on a very hot day and was amazed at how much power it had. The only downside I found is that it is loud, but if you are looking for a handheld fan that gives you big air, this is it. After using 2 of these, you should be aware that these fans are hit and miss. The first one I purchased worked like a dream for a long period, the second one broke and didn't work properly. If the fan works, then it's a good fan but if you get a lemon, not so much."
2,Drains batteries fast,The review title says it all. Once the batteries start wearing out (after about 30 min) you can barely feel a breeze.
1,My Mistake,"Not your error - but the item I received does not suit my needs. It is the wrong size and shape. Since it would cost more to ship it back than the item is worth, I will simply eat the cost."
2,NOT a classic version!,"...I immediately started playing but then realized this is a joke of a video game. I was looking for a replica of the arcade version from the 1980s but this game had nothing of that sort. I mean, they could at least put in some classic arcade version if they beat the game(if you ever do)! Plus, some of the silly little mode things are totally impossible to hit the dang aliens. The only reason I didn't give this game a big fat 1 is the bonus stages can sometimes be sort of fun and after you get off the first world thing, the second place has an interesting background. Hasbro Interactive should be ashamed of this poor attempt to take a classic video game and turn it into a fun game. This is not worth the money. If you see any good reviews about this game, I suggest you pretend they aren't even there because this game just plain STINKS!!!"
3,I liked the old arcade game better,"I was expecting to have whistling insect-like ships hurtling out of the sky at me and bonus rounds like in the original arcade version. Instead, they programmers have made the game 3D to make it more realistic, and your ship is much more maneuverable. The game isn't BAD, but I was expecting retro. Oh well. Guess one can't live in the past.Buy this game if you like flying spaceships through obstacles and shooting enemies. Don't buy it if you expect to play the arcade version on your Playstation. It ain't gonna happen."
3,Life Skills Resource for Teens,Sad video. Real story that could have been done bettr. Presented in a very dorky way according to todays terms.
5,My Favorite,"This is an awesome collection of Rick Springfield's work which spans the length of his career. If you jumped on the Rick Springfield bandwagon in the '80s or later, you'll be introduced to some of his earlier music, sang in a cute Aussie accent! The whole album is an excellent sampling of some of his best music and its interesting to follow the different stages of his writing as his music evolves with the different stages in his life. A definite must-have for Rick Springfield fans or for those that simply appreciate great music."
5,Written In Rock: The Rick Springfield Anthology,This 2 cd set has the best songs of Rick's career spanning from the 70s until current. It is a MUST HAVE for all die hard RS fans....and a great way to introduce new people to Rick's music.He definitely doesn't get the credit he deserves and after listening to this CD you'll see just how great of a musician/songwriter Rick really is.
1,Yukky smell,Sorry Bio-Groom but this stuff stinks - and smells even worse on my long haired chihuahua.
5,"MONO, earlier recording of album","TEF recorded ""Spirituals"" twice -- the same set of songs -- once in mono and once (a couple of years later) in stereo. This is the mono set, and though it is very close it is different from the later version, hence, my disappointment. Nevertheless, it is an absolutely wonderful album, and brings back many fond memories. I do wish Capitol would release the stereo version, however! The only way to get some of the songs on stereo is to buy the ""Amazing Grace"" 40 song two cd set, and that's just a few of the songs."
4,Great Find,"Isn't it amazing that there are other spirituals other than ""Amazing Grace"". I have missed hearing them, so this was a great find for me. I am really enjoying introducing the songs and Tennessee Ernie Ford to my grandchildren, ages 8, 4, & 18 months. Of course, at their ages, they like ""Get On Board, Little Children"", even the 18mo. sways to it. ""Wayfaring Pilgrim"" is my favorite. ""Were You There"", ""Stand By Me"",""Peace In The Valley, etc. They all gave me goose bumps when I was younger, and they still do. No one can sing them like Tennessee Ernie Ford."
3,Fairly good devotional book,"This book contains a lot of wisdom and good advice. I just have difficulty accepting AA's concept of a ""Higher Power."" They don't use the term God; they tell you that a ""Higher Power"" can be whatever you choose to make it. That, to me, cheapens their message"
4,RosieO64,"The book came quickly and in good condition. It was however the ""Large Type"" version for people with vision problems. It's size does not match its companion books and makes carrying them a little awkward. I did purchase it for what it contained and that is what is most important."
5,Courage to Change,"The book was mailed and arrived in a very short time and was in new condition, as advertised. There was no damage. All was as it should be. No problems."
2,Courage to change,"I expected more of a beginners how to manual, but instead this is written much like a diary. Didn't like it. Too bad."
2,Condition Not What I Usually Get,"I bought and had ""Courange to Change"" shipped to a friend. I have always had wonderful results from any purchases from Amazon as far as receipt and the condition being what was promised. I was disappointed, when I saw the copy of the book on her table, and picked it up. It looked like the pages had gotten wet - I ask her, and she said this was the condition it arrived to her home. I don't remember for sure what the product description was, however knowing I was sending this to someone else, I don't think I would have purchased a used copy if I had not thought it would be in good shape."
1,Not in good condition like I expected,When this book arrived it had a lot of writing in it and even had some personal phone numbers & sticky notes in the fron of the book. I would never have purchased this daily reader for my son if I knew it was going to be so obviously used.
5,Great Book,"The book arrived on time and was in great condition, given the price. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
5,A quick daily dose of focus,"This little book helps me focus on something positive (or a lesson I'm working on) in very bite-size pieces. Sometimes it's all I have time to read (each day is only 3-4 paragraphs), but it's effective.From the Preface: Taking life one day at a time has proven essential in the Al-Anon program of recovery for those whose lives have been adversely affected by the problem of alcoholism in a relative or a friend. This book, like it's companion volume _One Day at a Time in Al-Anon_, is designed to keep our focus on today and give us the courage ot change the things we can. ...Because these selections are based on sharings from individuals, they contain references to gender and to specific relationships, but the thoughts are applicable to people of all walks of life."
5,Inspirational and helpful!,"I've been in recovery for five years, and I use this book to start my day. It's full of helpful recovery reminders that make it a very special source of inspiration for me. My relationship with Jesus Christ, the Bible, and this little book make my recovery possible. I'd recommend it to anyone who struggles with issues of codependency."
4,enjoy,I'm glad that I purchased this item. I use it daily. It has some very good comments that hit home and are useful.
5,Amazing insight on your personal thoughts.,I don't know what I would have done without it. I was introduced to this literture by a dear friend and I have paid it forward to other friends and relatives. The messagers you read gives one hope and makes you feel that you are not alone in this journey called life.
4,Real Courage,Real courage is an everyday activity. Little by little learning how to have the courage to change one's own destructive patterns isn't easy. This book gives a gentle reminder to stay the course.
5,Making Re-adjustments,Courage to Change is an An-Anon sanctioned publication which I found extremely useful in effecting my own personal recovery from my self-inflicted personality abuse. Accepting the need to make lifelong adjustments is necessary if one desires to achieve any semblance of happiness. This daily reader works if one works it.
3,Good for the price.,"I wouldn't rate this pan very high. It is very thin, and dents easily against my other pans. Not good for a busy baker. But the price is low, and functions well enough. Just prefer better quality."
4,Good for the price,"I have used this springform couple times already. I was looking for a form that's a bit bigger than the regular standard sizes because I like to make German cakes, and in Germany the recipes refer to springforms of this size.The form is not very pretty, but is very useful. I can make cake in it, what else do I need? Nothing bad I can say about it. I have made pizza on just the tray, too. Works just as fine.Go for it, if you need a cheap springform that makes you happy!"
5,actually make that 6 stars,"Samurai X: is really Kenshin the OAV(DUH)for some stupid reason,the name was changed.overlook that and you have one of the greatest pieces of art to ever grace a DvD.Trust is parts 1 and 2 of a 4 part OAV.it is the story of Kenshins past,what made him what he is in the TV series,how he got his scars. Art and animation is clearly high budget.character design is diffirent from the series,the story takes a dark and serious mood through out the entire feature,music is top notch.take it from someone who bought the original japanese version.the price is practacly a give away for this OAV,unlike some series which I won't watch even if paid.I will not give away any part of the story since it is part of the experiance,just be ready not to do anything for a few hours after watching this."
4,Samurai X - trust me it's great,"I had read the reviews on Amazon of the two parts of Samurai X and was so inspired to buy both on DVD without having seen any of it. I was not disappointed.As of yet I have only watched the dubbed version, but the dvd contains the original language track too. This a great piece of Anime, not the greatest, but it does have some of the best plotline i've ever seen in Anime.The whole development of character and plotline is seamless, everything flows smoother than cold mountain dew down your throat. I am a great admirer of romance, especially in Anime, this is a rare example of how action, serious drama and romance can mix into a great piece of art.In order to get the full extent of the Samurai X, you need to see both parts Trust and Betrayal, you cannot see one without the other. Dont expect lots of action, but the action you do get is top class and is present throughout the 2 parts."
1,Comparable to Ninja Scroll? no..,i ordered this dvd after many people said it was comparable to Ninja Scroll. It's not.boring realismtypical plotuninteresting artworkuninspired action
5,masterpiece,"This is an amazing piece of work. To really enjoy it, I would recommend either watching the first parts of theTV series, or reading the entire manga. Preferablely the manga, since everything is based off the manga.Trust is the story of Himura kenshin, an assassin. i won't give the story away ere, but know it it an actual story that makes sense. trust has it all: characters that make your heart bleed for them, animation that is extrodainary, and music that is unbeliveble.A caveat: while the english dub is livable, the japanese with subtitles is the best. There are occasional real ife shots in the animation that look weird to me. But this is a must for any true RK fan."
3,European Americana,"Friendly, funky rockabilly and old-fashioned country boogie from... Finland? Looks like it. These guys are alright; depending on your sense of humor, you might get a kick out of their Northern accents, as they try to wrap themselves around an American country twang."
5,another crazy auditory journey....,"Combining a zeppelin-esque melody with crazed vocals, Oxbows' latest release is a hard one to define but definitely rates a listen. More than just songs, each track seems to transport you into a separate auditory adventure, combining accessible sounds with somewhat abrasive vocals. This album plays off of emotions, with a overtly passionate lyricist who at times sounds like Tom Waits just gargled a mouthful of thumb tacks, and time signatures reminiscent of classic rock at it's best. Oxbows' latest album is ""Noise Rock"" at it's best and easily one of the best releases of the year."
4,"strange band, strange music","I have first heard of Oxbow last year when I bought their DVD ""love that's last"". I was surprised to learn that this band existed for almost 20 years. It is a sophisticated band, but the music is hard to define. It's not indie, not blues, not metal, definitely not jazz, not really experimental either... I don't know if I will still be listening to this music next year, or in 10 years, but for now I am intrigued. It is original and intense."
3,A family outing to the Coronation and a snapshot of the times,"It's the 2nd June 1953 and Will Clagg is a proud man who has bought his family prime viewing tickets for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II - forgoing the annual family holiday at the sea in exchange for the expense of the trip to London. However, once they get to London things don't go quite as planned.This is the story of an ordinary family who go to London for a once-in-a-life-time event, but the event they get is not the one that they anticipate. The writing is simple and easy to read. This is a reasonably short story at 128 pages that is quickly read but leaves you with a good feeling at the end. If you are after a quick read that is not padded out or pretentious and has a realistic feeling for the event it revolves around then this is a good book to pick up."
2,"Love Hapa, hate this","Barry Flanagan created some absolutely beautiful music as part of Hapa, but here he simply buries himself in new age drivel. If you like that sort of stuff I suppose it's OK, but if you're looking for inspired Hawaiian music you'll need to look elsewhere."
4,Model Airplane,"Model was exactly as represented. This brand name was specifically requested by the recipient, who likes to build and collect WWII era model planes. Very realistic and pieces well-designed and well-fitted."
2,Itty bitty,"I am okay with itty bitty rockets because you can launch them in small field with a 1/4 engine. This is the first mini rocket I have owned that didnt tumble land. It is supposed to eject the engine and tumble to earth. Instead it ejected the engine and came down Mach 2 nose first like an arrow and stuck into the dirt. Now that is okay if is like a block from you but even this shrimpy rocket is a little scary when it is coming back to you like an arrow at Mach 2. Amazingly it did survive the landing in that the fins didnt break off on impact. I was chicken to launch it again though with my kids around until I could figure out a way to make it tumble. Rechecked the instructions, I built it correctly, dunno why it wont tumble."
3,Hate or Pride,"Bell Hooks brings literature an exciting aspect of writing in Where We Stand: Class Matters. She presents facts from her childhood and from the present about how her class has affected her life. As a young black girl growing up in a world that race did matter and did affect things like what kind of jobs you got; where you could live and even which water fountains you could drink from she realized the hardship this world would give her. She grew to be strong torwards her pride and was respected for not backing down in tight situations. The thing this book makes you question however is, whether she is doing this to gain respect or merely now it is out of hate from the past. It is a great book to seek perspective from as a culturally non hand fed black american in a world of questioning and money thriving sensations."
3,Class dosent matter!,"I loved the beginning of this book, and I was really understanding how she felt, and how all this made her who she is now. But once i got to the middle and end, I thought she was taking iteverything out porportion. I have heard Bell Hooks, is a very inspirational speaker, and I'm sure she is, but she can go alittle too far."
1,Can't believe this ever got published!,"I read this book for my sociology class. While I agree completely that class matters I think Bell Hooks does an extremely poor job of explaining why. Throughout the novel I felt like I was reading a paper written by a ten year old. Things just don't make sense. Also, the way it's written is very subjective, taking away any credibility it might have had. She does make some good points but nothing that other books about the same subject don't make. It's not worth trudging through the repetative nonsense of the rest of the book. Don't waste your money, there are many GOOD books out there (try ""Ain't no Makin it"" By Jay MacLeod for a good book on same topic)."
4,What I think,"Class does matter in the world whether we like to admitt it or not. Bell Hooks uses a variety of examples in her life to prove this point. Yes, she does use repetitive examples but there are repetitive issues dealing with race and class going on in the world right now. Thus, it helps prove the point even more.Many people like to state that class does not matter but deep down inside it matters. Hooks' novel is actually very real and it is hard for many people to admit that it is. I think she deserves four stars."
3,class,"When reading Bell Hooks class matters i came to realize the importance of why class matters. Bell's examples of how her family did not talk about class relate to me. In my family we never considered where we stood in society. My parents would try to do there best to raise me, but they never complained that it was because of our class when it really was. Bell hooks let me understand where my place in society is through her book."
3,Coming Out Of The Shadows,Where We Stand by bell hooks addresses the issue of class in society. She does this by using her experiences in her life growing up as a black female born into the lower class. This book discusses Hooks's struggle to climb the social ladder and what inhibits others from doing the same thing. This novel addesses all the issues of class that are in the shadows that no one else will bring up. After reading this book I was forced to look at social class in a different way. It will be an educational experience for anyone who reads it.
3,Repetitive yet enlightening,"I had to read Where We Stand for my college english class. I liked the way that hooks used her own experiences to point out the fact that most people do not want to think about the position they hold on the social ladder. However, I felt that hooks was quite repetitive with her words and phrases, which made it a little difficult to remain interested. I would still recommend the book though. It really makes you think about where you stand in society and the reasons why you are where you are. The book is quite enlightening. Just look past all of the mechanical monotony."
4,What I think,"Bell Hooks uses many experiences in her life to explain her issues with class and race. Her writing style is repetitive at times but I think that it is nessecairy for the point to get across. After all, issues with class and race is a repeating probelm through out her life and our lives. Bell Hooks style of writing helps prove her point even more. I give her four stars for her content, style of writing and interesting stories."
1,Read for Masters program,The author is very direct and honest with her belief system and call to action. I agree in macro with her. She makes very salient points but then paints with a broad brush of communist talking points. I would prefer it if there was more substance and a logical layout of ideas versus angry rants.
1,Not original material,"This book is entirely comprised of material lifted, without credit, from The Clear Light Society (www.ClearLightSociety.org). The physical techniques described are accurate (accurately copied), but the origin, background, and validation are just not there. Look to the original material."
3,Average mini-movie pleases non-fan...,"I've never really been into ""Dragonball Z,"" but I approached this hour long movie with an open mind and was pleased with what I got. This is like the prequel story to ""Dragonball Z,"" telling the story of Goku's father Bardock and how he is given special psychic abilities to see into the future. The animation is not all that great, which is why it only gets a 3/5 in my book, but I liked the story and am interested in seeing other DBZ stuff. This is a good starting point for the ""Dragonball"" series."
2,Not as expected,"This product did not come with the cute green and white checkered pattern that was shown in the picture. Instead it had stripes and dots, while ok, is not what I wanted. I was disappointed with the pattern that I received, and the quality (softness) is also less than expected."
4,"Diddie, Dumps and Tot","An interesting look at life from the slaveowners perspective with information on customs, songs and etiquette. Underplays the tragedy of owning slaves, but gives insight to the minds of the plantation owners."
2,Unhappy with the10 in non-stick pan,Unhappy with this 10 in non-stick pan becasue the black is comming off inside the pan around where the handle is connected. Can't seems to find the company's web-site to ask if they cover this problem.
5,L'Immortel/22 Bullets!,Im just a sucker for Jean Reno I guess but this movie is excellent & so worth it too! Jean Reno is GREAT as usual-he can make an ok movie worth watching! The only down fall of this movie is spoken in french but at least theres english subtitles to go with it! This movie is along the line of (Leon)The Professional-also with Jean Reno! If you loved the Professional than youll love this movie!
5,L'Immortel,This is one great movie i didnt even mind the subtitals like a french godfather.So enjoy well worth it.even my wife liked it and my 18 year old.
5,Captivating magic!,"Jewel is a unicorn who follows her bliss -- she's out to hook up with her fantastic pals, but has lots of adventures along the way! She encounters elves, fairies, caves and swamps, and adds her magical sparkle to everything she touches. Lively pictures filled with detail -- so much magic in every page. If you love unicorns, you'll find Jewel absolutely enchanting!"
1,lacked pieces,"The Jewel book came without the jewels. I also bought another book at the same time and it also came with out the jewels. I don't think I would by from this seller again. The description same ""new"" but the books came with a used sticker on them."
3,Sparkles,"This activity book is good for kids because it keeps them involved in the story, by applying stickers shaped like jewels to the book as they follow along."
4,"5 generations, 100 years, and insight into Jerusalem","This novel, chock-filled with folk customs and superstitions, is a best seller in Israel. It concerns the lives of five generations of Jerusalem women, five generations that are cursed with spouses that disappear. When Amal's husband disappears after she gives birth, she initiates an investigation into her family history and lore. Why is the family cursed? Her search extends back to her Great-great-grandmother, Mazal, who was probably missing alot of Mazal (luck). Oy, such tsuris that befalls these generations of women. But along the way, we learn much about Jewish folklore and the neighborhoods of Jerusalem"
3,This book comes with me to mass,When I want to connect to St. Jude this book does it. I take it with me to mass and helps me with praying to St. Jude. I carry it in my purse when going to mass. Good book.
1,Unbelievable purchase,"I cannot believe my eyes when I opened the box. The filter is apparently an used one. Who would buy an used fuel filter, oil filter, or air filter?UpdateAmazon customer services are really the first class. Unfortunately, the quality of products does not match up. I received the replacement which again is the same as what I received the first time. It is not Amazon's fault, but ACDelco. ACDelco brand name will be completely erased from my memory."
4,Abstract Algebra provides a clear course in Abstract Algebra,"Abstract Algebra provides a helpful look into the great topic of Abstract Algebra. While, like most Dover books, it does not provide extensive amounts of problems or their solutions, Deskins attempts to explain each topic from elementary number theory to matrices building upon previous knowledge with the least confusion as possible. Deskins' book does not require extensive mathematical background or sheer mathematical genius. Instead, only the desire to learn is required to become enriched by this book. I recommend Abstract Algebra to any high-school or colledge student wishing to expand their mathematical horizons."
2,Not a memorable read.,"If you are interested in science writing and how scientists and those who write about scientists' work influence and affect eachother, you might find some useful information here. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
5,Great MOVIE!!!,This movies is Great! I watched it in Guadalajara on Labor Day Weekend 2006 when it was released to the theaters in Mexico with three of my best friends...we were all 30 at that time and it was funny to watch stuff we were going thru at our first existentialist crisis. Good Message delivered in a funny and smart way.
3,Heavy going classic.,"'When thou wert young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old, another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.'Do you find this type of narrative heavy going? If you're comfortable with this style of writing then fine, this book could be made for you.If, like me, you're something of a dummy when presented with old-style prose, you will undoubtedly struggle with page after page of some heavy spritual self-analysis and desperate inner searches for God's truth. I definitely recommend you give this one a miss.It is a dour, dreary and would be over-long if written in normal English; it seemed everlasting and tedious in the extreme in this form. It also felt like one was being preached to, and that dire consequences ultimately awaits the unconverted.I thought the movie was infinitely better!"
3,"I've read it before, but this version is strange","I honestly don't remember who translated the version I first read in paperback form, but I loved it and read it over and over again. If you're looking for a recommendation as to the quality of the book, it is excellent! I used to read it about once per year until I misplaced it. This version is different and I was having a hard time getting through it. If you get this and don't enjoy it, don't give up-try another translation, because it is so good!"
1,Outdated,"This book, even though it seems like a great title, is outdated. Furthermore, the book is geared towards an OVERVIEW of the technology and is not deeply technical. If you are looking for good working knowledge of Integration Tools or other SOA and Integration Broker, this book will not suffice. Look for a more recent book on this subject matter."
1,Not useful,I tried to read this book twice.I'm writing an interface to PeopleSoft system.This book does not provide much useful info.It is confusing too.I much prefer PeopleSoft Administrator's Guideby Darrell Bilbrey.
4,Houdini: The Greatest Magician Ever?,"This book is a very concise biography of Harry Houdini. The book begins at his child hood and continues to his death. This book has great descriptions of Houdini's life. It displays the ways that he completed his stunts and tricks of illusions. this book is fun to read and easy to read. Also if you enjoy magic, this is the book for you."
2,a kids review,This book had some of Houdini's greatest accomplishments but it was sort of boring. I mean what kid would really be intrested in reading about his excerteras.
5,Bought as gift.,I bought this movie for my brother for Christmas. He has wanted it for years but couldn't find it. It is a good biker movie if you're into that type thing which we are. I love Brian Bosworth's big lizard in the movie.
2,Inane biker flick,"Bad acting, overused storyline-Brian Bosworth plays a cop who infiltrates a sadistic biker gang to bring them to justice. Senseless to the point of annoying."
2,"A ""New Jack City"" with Caucasians","Remember at the Oscars when Chris Rock said ""Walk the Line"" was just a white version of ""Ray"" and Joaquin Phoenix, the main actor in ""Walk the Line,"" smiled in agreement? Well, this film is nothing but a white version of ""New Jack City.""In both films, an athletic cop goes undercover to infiltrate the villain's set-up. In both, a villain's henchman smells a rat. In both, the mafia plays a role, but are not the main actors. In both, the female love interest of the main villain seems like she could be brought to the good side. In both, near the end, a man falls from some stairs to his death.If someone gives you chocolate ice cream, I guess you might as well cover it with whip cream!"
3,"Lots of fun, great screen villains.","I really didn't hold out much hope that this one would even be watchable, but I was dead wrong. Brian Bosworth does a reasonable turn as a cop coerced into working for the FBI to crack a biker gang, but it's Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe who steal the show. Lance plays Chains Cooper, the leader of the local chapter of The Brotherhood and William Forsythe is his lieutenant, Ice. Nice working partnership both as characters and as actors playing off of each other.If you like biker flicks, this one is really pretty good, but it's very hard to find. Worth an order."
1,Do not have it yet!!!!,I can not review this product because it has been a month tomorrow and I still do not have my DVD.
1,taped over movie,I was in this movie and I taped over it. It makes bikers look like idiots and is totally unrealistic. If nothing else it is good for a laugh for the script alone. I am now ordering the movie only because I am in it as an extra and it would be nice to have.
3,great christmas present.,"I was very happy with this product, as it was a christmas present for my father, however, I paid for expedited shipping on it and I received a product that I didnt pay for expedited shipping on before I received this one, so that was the only downfall. luckily i received this christmas eve."
5,THE REAL STONE COLD STUNNER,I watched THE BOZ when he played professional football but then I saw this movie and it the most incredible and watchable action movies that i've ever seem!
4,"The ""Boz's"" best movie","By far the best movie Brian Bosworth ever made. Undercover cop infiltrates a motorcycle gang led by b-movie superstar Lance Henriksen and William Forsyth. Bosworth is certainly able to handle the physical part of the role and with the success of the movie many things were expected of him in the action genre. But that never materialized. He made mostly direct to video movies and disappeared for quite awhile all mtogether. I see on IMDB that he has 3 completed movies this year. So we will see if he has a comeback or not. Back to the movie, lots of action and highly enjoyable."
5,Great to have it on DVD,"I got this jewel on VHS when it came out...now it's great to finally have it on DVD. I'm probably partial to this movie since I live in Little Rock, the city in which Stone Cold was filmed (that's the Arkansas state capitol during the final ""blow-em-up"" fight scenes). But still, it's not a bad action film at all. And there are so many local stories around here regarding the filming (especially from those who watched the chopper fly street level down Capitol Avenue). I just wished there were ""extras"" on the disc. What you get is just the movie, plus scene selections. Get this while you can...it's a great addition to your DVD collection (and fun to watch)."
2,I am not a fan.,"I don't like this movie, but my ex-husband LOVES it, it is his favorite of all time. It is an action movie, and for some reason, men love it."
4,Stone Cold,"Obviously ""Boz"" hasn't made a career in movies any more than Howie Long did, but I love their movies. I personally think movies like this are just fun. Now granted the guys will probably like them better as their is lots of T&A; in this one, but the acting isn't bad, and the sets and music are good. Brian Bosworth plays a cop on suspension that is coerced by the FBI to go undercover and join a biker gang to take them down. Lance Henriksen and William Forsyth do a good job of playing the bad guys. Having rode with the Salty Dawgs many many years ago and knowing other clubs I have to say this is fairly realistic biker movie. The meet in the movie reminded me of one of the barbeques I went to when I rode. The statement ""Colors never run"", is a code with all bikers and a fellow biker saved my life once so it isn't something you forget. Good quality DVD but no extras. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Firestorm"" and ""One Man's Justice"".CA Luster"
4,Underrated,"This was one of the coolest movies of its time. It had everything you want in an action movie. Guns, fights, women, bikes, ect...The acting was not great but I would put this action movie up with any that I can remember."
5,"Finally, Finally, Finally, Finally, Finally, !!!!!!!!!!!",If you haven't seen this movie yet then there is a void in your life! From start to finish this is action packed and has the man Lance Henriksen in it!! And William Forsythe who is a bad mf'r in this. The Boz ain't the best actor in the world but he does a great job in this flick. It's the ultimate biker movie. I have been waiting forever for this movie to be on dvd and it's finally on it's way. 5 stars and 2 thumbs way up for this!!! If you haven't seen this then I recommend highly that you do. I'm so stoked to see this coming to dvd I can't even explain!!!!!
5,Stone Cold,"Joe Huff is a cop who is angry at the system for handling criminals with kid gloves. Joe is on suspension, but the FBI gives him an opportunity to go undercover in Mississippi and infiltrate ""The Brotherhood,"" a white supremacist biker gang that runs drugs. In the Brotherhood, each member legally changes his name to his Brotherhood nickname. The Brotherhood is led by a violent psychopath named Chains Cooper. Joe rechristened ""John Stone"" accepts the job, even though he's not happy about it. His FBI contact, Lance, doesn't really look at home in biker bars. And the members of the Brotherhood, especially Chains, have their doubts about Joe, who wants a piece of their action. Joe has to kill a man as his initiation. With the FBI's help, he carefully fakes a murder and is accepted by everyone except for Chains's right hand man Ice, who still thinks Joe's an undercover cop. If you truly enjoy watching action movies, Stone Cold is a must see."
4,Uplifting,"This CD is one of the best CDs. The music is great, and it leaves you in high spirits, unlike some CDs. They can leave you feeling dark inside."
4,Does Disney Own The Planet?,"A deliriously funny trip through the mad places the earth's inhabitants call home. Eco skewers like ""kitsch-ka-bob"" the artificial pseudo paradises we have created with all our so-called modern conveniences. What have we turned our cities into, by the way? Do we really understand art?If you've ever driven through rural Arkansas or Texas and wanted to capture with words the seemingly inexplicable, paradoxical sights along the way, it's been done for you and can be enjoyed in these side-splitting pages.Lots of fun."
5,on travels in hyperreality,"i got this book because of the essay by which it is entitled. it is a great work, and a basic reading for those interested on the topics of hyperreality, simulated or thematized environments, and the like. quite contemporary tho Eco's work is Baudrillard's la precession des simulacres. so they are from the 70's and much more has been written on the topic, but these texts are, as i said, basic to understand all the rest. eco's work is quite openning ranging from xanaduswax museums, the theming of nature, etc. it is worthy."
3,not the best DRF but very good,not as good as some of their soundtracks like penetentiary chances or smile now cry later but if you like darkroom definately worth buyin
2,Great expansion but.......,Having played shadowlands for several weeks now I find that the expansion is well worth the price. But...Unfortunately having bought this product in order to save on a huge download via a dialup connection i found that it is only a cheep way to get the product key. Funcom has (and continues to) made so many chages that you will be forced to DL the large client from one of their sites. For anyone with a high speed connection this is only a few hours but on dialup better have a friend DL it for you.
3,preaty good,"It is a grate movie, dragon ball fan will aprove. If you ar'nt big in to DB then you may want to look at something else."
5,Great!!!,"Well, not that I'm a huge fan of Funimation's dub of Dragonball or Dragonball Z, as far as the dubbing itself is concerned, this movie is pretty good. But, come on, you aren't buying this for the dub! You want the Japanese version with subtitles. Frankly, this is Funimation's best DVD to date, and although the sound quality is a bit weak, the quality of the movie more than makes up for it. So go buy it now!!!"
4,great beattem up,if you like beaten the tar out of who ever in front of you then get it if your looking for super inavation well look some where else i like this cause it reminds me of those dynasty warrior series if you like that then buy this like i did ok take care p.s. gundam style game thats out seem pretty cool
4,Challenging!,"This game is good! It's fun and super hard to play. You have definitely got to plan out your attack every time you play or spend several hours playing stages over just to see through a stage. You level up characters and earn horses, weapons, new moves.. . . the game is fun. Worth the buy if you also want to play with someone to do some serious bonding or teamwork skills."
2,Tedious,"I have really enjoyed some of Clegg's books, particularly Hour Before Dark and The Infinite. I found this in a used bookstore and was eager to read it. It was vaguely Salem's Lot-ish, lots of characters in a small town and everyone eventually goes bad. Even though Clegg is basically a pulp horror writer, his characterizations, even here, are very good, realistic. This just didn't have enough of a plot to justify 400 pages. After awhile it became tedious and boring. Everyone is possessed by malignant evil and dies in appropriately grisly fashion. Yawn. The last half of the book needed to be trimmed by half again. Granted, it is his first published novel, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone other than diehard fans."
2,Hard to read; harder to like,I broke one of my cardinal rules with this one - I couldn't finish it. I slogged through about a third of it and then just had to put it down. It should have been interesting; I should have cared about the characters -- but I just couldn't get there.
3,Chris reviews Goat Dance,This book was just Ok not very spooky my heart did not pound while reading it as with some of Stephen Kings novels.It was a quick read and I did not care about the characters much.I will give Mr. Clegg another try later on and hope he can writesomething a little spookier!
3,"a bit boring, actually.","I could not get wrapped around this tale. I liked the characters and there were some spooky moments, but it seemed half-finished. There is an underlying premise about some Indian folklore and history, yet it is never fully explained how it relates to the plot. It touches on the subject, but never fleshes it out. But at least Clegg makes some interesting characters, and they are likable.Again, not a bad book, just did nothing for me!"
2,"As far as horror goes, this is not Steven King","This book is one of the most confusing horror novels I've ever read. I completely disliked the writers style of writing and the way he jumped back and forth from one person's perspective to another's. I had to repeated go back and read something because I thought it was focused on another character and eventually realized that it wasn't. There are better ways to change viewpoints in a book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was one of the few books I really didn't want to finish, but I'm not one to give up. I read it all the way through and regretted the waste of time."
1,review of enforcer,"This movie was previously entitled ""my father is a hero"" and it is terrible. The plot is stupid and the cineatography is terrible even on DVD. The martial arts fight do not display Jet Li true talent. Avoid this movie. If you really want to see a great Jet Li movie that displays his awesome martial arts talent, get ""Fist of Legend"" that is his best movie and believe me, you will not be disappointed."
1,The Enforcer,I love the movie but was very dissapointed with this purchuse because the dvd was all scratched and unplayable and i could not return it for i had to open it up to find out the condition and the policy was that cant return open items. well that is very messed up and it makes me wonder about the films that i buy in the future.
3,Good movie but dubbing can ruin a film,I have the Chinese import version which is titled my father is a hero. I prefer a movie which has subtitles rather than dubbing. I rate the import 4 1/2 stars. The transfer from film of the recently dubbed movies seems much better than the imports. More Hong Kong films are being dubbed but I wish they had the choice for multi-language.There is a good balance of drama and action in this film. The acting is decent but the story is more believable than other HK films.
2,Not a good Jet Li Movie,"I'll be brief, this movie was not done very well. Though the few fight scenes are good, the kid and Jet do a wonderful job, the plot is laughable at best. I ran to see this VHS and it was a major disappointment. The dubbing is awful, and the dialog is even worse. I wouldn't tell someone to rent this unless they were set on seeing all of Jet's movies. Even then I would tell them to think twice. Sorry!"
2,"American version ok, da original chinese version much better","This movie was ok, but da dubbing ..., and thanx alot to ""Dimension Home Video"" they re did da sound effects of da movie and it was capital B ""BAD"". Trust me, if u wanna get dis movie on VHS or DVD, get da orginal one ""My Father Is A Hero"", itz in itz original language (since I never saw da original, I think da original language is Cantonese, either dat or Mandarin) and da sound effects have gotta be better. I saw da dubbed version of ""Once Apon A Time In China"" and compared to da original version (Cantonese) I saw da original is WAY better"
3,The Enforcer,"I was a little disappointed in this movie. From seeing the preview I thought this would have been a really great movie especially with all the people that were in it, but the title is far from being accurate. The movie is ok, but Li's character is a little flaky. He is an undercover police man who has a very ill wife and a small son. His boss doesn't care about that and sends him out on assignments. Li doesn't ask them to check on his wife and son at all. It takes another police officer from another province to see to them and ends up taking the son with her when his mother dies. The real highlight of this movie is the actor that plays his son, Tse Mui. He is really great for a child his age. Look forward to seeing more of him."
2,Good Movie Bad DVD,"Shame on Dragon Dynasty for abusing its reputation.Why re-release the same old lousy version of a moviethat Jet Li fans already have access to.What I loved about Dragon Dynastyis that they did not do that. I guess they do now.I will wait for a re-release of ""My Father Is A Hero""with the original language and music and withoutwhatever other changes were madeor will seek one elsewhere.I suggest fans of Jet Li, martial arts and police dramasdo the same."
4,"Jet is Great, Tze Mui is Amazing","I emmensely enjoyed this film's action scenes, because I am so used to watching Jet Li flying around with wires stuck to his back, I was sort of surprised to see his real kung fu skills. Although the martial arts sequences are short and limited, they are very effective and are a break from the normal ""challenge"" fights which Jet Li films usually consist mainly of. The story is involving unlike some of Li's period pieces, and his son in the film, Tze Mui, from New Legend of Shaolin and God of Gamblers' Return, is simply unbelievable. I'd really like to know if the thing called ""breathless kung fu"" is actually taught."
1,"Great movie, but BAD RELEASE",Read this carefully. This movie is fun and exciting. It's a well done Jet Li film. I like the chemistry between Jet Li and his son. But this release by Dragon Dynasty is horrible. They did not release the film in it's original language nor with its original soundtrack.If you are a purist then avoid this release and find a Hong Kong import that does the film the just that it deserves.
3,Dimension's second release does not live up to its first,"This is the second release in the Jet Li collection by Dimension Home Video and where its first release Fist of Legend suceeded The Enforcer fails. First off, Jet Li is magnificent in the few fight scenes he is in, and the movie My Father Is A Hero (The Enforcer) is one of Jet's better all around films. However Dimension seems to have sped up Jet in his final fight scene in this release and the music and revamped sound effects do not always coincide. I would have given this film a four stars if not for this shortcoming. Fist of Legend was beautifully done in this aspect to bad The Enforcer didn't follow suit. Hopefully Twin Warriors (Dimension's next release aka Tai Chi Master) will learn from its first progenitor rather than this one. This still does not encumber the beauty of Jet's kinetic and irresistable screen presence."
4,"I think, it's just simply amazing story.","This is the second movie, the boy plays his son. The action is 4 stars and Anita Mui is wonderful, as always. Kinda sad story, a good father/son story and a great fighting scene with the big ending."
3,It Was Alright......Lacked Action and Storyline,"Wow, the only good part of the movie was Jet Li and the kid that played his son in the movie (sorry cannot recall name). It had a few good action scenes but if you are looking for a good action movie by Jet Li check out Fist of Legen or Twin Warriors. Those are my two favorite Jet Li movies and they are a must see for every martial arts fan. Good try Jet, but stick with the good scripts and you'll get a better critique next time."
4,Fat Boys is a classic,this movie is a great funny classic that even though is old and a low budget it is hillarious. It is a must see for all comedy fans!
2,One fabulous feature...five that are a drag,"There is one really wonderful feature here, The Story of The Cat And The Moon. It is the story of an aging cat who is quite mad and utterly in love with the moon. Wonderful black and white imaging and exquisite story monologue. It is probably worth owning this DVD just for this one feature alone. The other five are not so much noir as just deadly boring and depressing. You should try to see this before you buy it, as it is really not for all tastes."
1,What a flop,"Anyone expecting either good animation or good noir is going to be very disappointed with this collection. By and large, the films are monumentally dull. The brief ""Cat and the Moon"" provides almost the only glimmer of interest; the rest of the disc feels like a bunch of student exercises.This disc will probably bore you silly, despite the trio of five-star reviews below -- all by ""A viewer from Chicago."" (Wow, what a coincidence that three Windy City residents all loved this tedious DVD and used the same words to describe it.) If you're looking for great animation with a dark twist, try Jan Svankmajer or the Brothers Quay instead."
3,Fits nice but .......,The sunshade fits nicely in the windshield but it is a little bit of work to roll up and stow. The thickness of the sunshade makes it hard to handle.
4,"Yes, what a show...","Yes I was there as well.. I didn't have my camera for the evening performance nor for the bus trip for milk and cookies, but I did take photos on the Staten Island Ferry the next day. They're posted at [...] At Carnegie, of course loved some parts, hated others. That's what Andy wanted!Let me know what you think of the photos! Bob Mantin, beepersound at yahoo dot com."
4,Andy are you goofin' on Elvis? Are you having fun?,"I bought this video after going to the May 16th Dead or Alive Kaufman Special at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, and I needed to see more of this genius. (The show, by the way, was pretty amazing! All night I kept thinking maybe Andy is still alive.) This video was very entertaining, and made me miss Andy Kaufman's talent even more. I was thrilled to see Andy upto his antics, but a bit disappointed with Clifton's short skit. Anyhow, it's worth the money to own this one b/c it gives you a childish nostalgic feeling."
3,"Part Drive-in, Part Road Trip","I was a bit disappointed in this DVD because it is part road trip, and part documentary of Drive-ins. If I wanted a road trip movie I would buy one with some comedy. There are some great parts including an interview with John Carpenter and some of the drive-in owners. To much of it to suit me shows how 4 guys cross the country in an old Cadillac. That is not exactly what I was after. I do not recommend this if you are mainly interested in Drive-ins unless you are trying to get all you can find on them. You will get some decent photos, a few good shots of drive-ins still operating in the mid 90s, and some of the old commercials. So not an entire waste, but I think it is overpriced for what you get."
5,Delightful Stories about Ten Saints,"There are ten delightful stories for those 10 years old (IE. in 5th grade) or older. While there is only on picture of each saint in this book, the stories are well told of Saints:Christopher - who supposedly carried the boy Jesus on his back through a riverMartin - a Roman soldier who became a monk after giving a cloak to a poor man, who he learned was Jesus in disguiseDorothea - who sent flowers back to her executioner from heavenBridget - an Irish nun who cared for the poorPatrick - the missionary priest to IrelandHubert - royalty who changed from hunting deer to hunting soulsGiles - a hermit fed by a doeSimeon Stylites - who preached on top of a pillar for yearsNicholas - from whence the story of Santa ClauseFrancis - who needs no ""introduction""."
2,Inconsistent cheap product,I bought 4 of these from a different online store. They are made in China and two of them did not work. There are many of them at different online stores and even on Amazon with slightly different pictures. Look at the color of the cable and the end connectors to compare. Not sure if they are actually USB 2.0 or not. Stay away from them if you can. Spend the extra $10 to get a better and more consistent brand.
2,"shoddy product, avoid","As the other reviewer says, this cheap cable is not worth the slight savings over good brands. I tried to extend the range of a wireless mouse transmitter, and after a few minutes of inactivity the device is disconnected and the extension cable must be manually reconnected to resume operation. Sort of negates the advantage of a wireless mouse...Also tried it with a normal wired mouse, and of course, same thing happens. So, it's the cable. Worthless except maybe for extremely brief uses, and even then is it really worth a few dollars of savings? I learned my lesson..."
1,very disapppointed only last one week,ordered the pump and installed.one week later i had to drop tank and install new pump.went back with better brand.
3,Semi-interesting,"We're using this book for our AP Comparative Government course, and I really have mixed feelings about it. While the information and style of writing is much more interesting than previous AP social studies books that I've had, the book is a bit dense in its black-and-white format with lots and LOTS of text. The other component that this book is also lacking is a BRIEF run-through or diagram of the countries' political systems. If you want to fashion your own condensed version of these systems, you must wade through quite a bit of text that is not particularly well organized."
3,Rather dry,This edition is jammed with information and little charts. But my beef is with the how the text is very dry. It was difficult to read when there was little character to the text. I do understand that if it was dry then it might be unbiased to the many political topics. A plus is that the subjects and chapters cover are intriguing and flow with one another.
4,Classic,"DVD presents really classic ballet as performances included since 1913 testify to.Nice music,nice dancing-nothing by Pavlova, also she improved her dancing in Australia in the twenties, the cinematography was surely in that part of a British Empire."
3,McNugget clips/mini-me excerpts,"OK, better than nothing. Where else will you see even 3 minutes of a 1913 Bolshoi performance? But these are indeed really really short excerpts. The Bolshoi archives must contain fuller videos. Open the vaults! Haven't these guys heard about glaznost?There is also something tragic about watching this esthetic art form being documented in a country that represented Murder, Inc. In the 1930s, the Soviets authorized the murder of millions of Ukranians. Post WW2 they subjugated Eastern Europe, crushed the Hungarian revolution in 1956, the Czech revolt in 1968. Soviet/Russians supported East Germans who shot & killed anyone who tried to cross the Berlin Wall until 1990. Many dancers accepted their privileged status. Nureyev & Barishnikov, among others, defected. We do not criticize Soviet dancers who stayed quiet about beast-Stalin, while we excoriate German artists who didn't speak out against beast-Hitler. The world is a funny place, yes? or do I mean ""no""?"
5,Best cd ever,this cd is the best cd i ave ever listened to . it is a perfect alternative mnsic. perfect for teens
3,Alright.. It's wasn't bad but it wasnt great,Your better off buying the few songs you do like on iTunes. Thats what I wish I did or at least another album of his.
2,Disappointed,"To be honest, even through I'm writing this review in 2005, I first cooped this CD on release. This, being the follow up to collaborations, is very disappointing. To me it's comes over as if he rused the whole thing. If you want to start off buying/lidtening to KJ, I would recommend collarations, as even through it's not brilliant, it's alot better than this. He is mad talented, but needs to be focused on his next joint."
5,Great music from the 1950's,My parents literally wore out their LP record of this title. I was so happy to find this music again on CD. It reminds me of the wonderful music that filled our home a long time ago.
4,Among the best for puzzle fans.,"Crossword puzzles in this series are some of my mom's favorites.They are wire-bound, making it easier to lay them flat and get down to business. But she would prefer they be laid out on single pages, and have larger type.The puzzles are challenging without being overwhelming. These are roughly comparable to those found in the NY Times and LA Times, in both level of difficulty and in their design.A pretty safe bet for fans, but no 5th star for the reasons above."
5,A fabulous CD!,"I don't know what these people are talking about. I've heard the BYU cd and it leaves me cold. The tone is so pure and thin that it has no life to it. The Choral Project breathes life into these pieces by Eric Whitacre. Another winner is Frank Ticheli's ""There Will Be Rest"". Simply stunning. A fabulous CD!"
3,"Good attempt, but it falls short.","I think this book is good in that there is not a lot on this subject so Thornton did a lot of research. The book is actually poorly written, unlike the his other book Africans and the Making of Africa I believe is the title. Sometimes its very hard to follow what he is saying. It also purely descriptive, not a lot of analysis on the larger themes."
5,Reliving two great stories,"I watched this as a child and absolutely loved it. I still love it, and now my grandchildren adore it."
5,"I'm unsure how broad this DVD's appeal would be, but if you were a kid in the 1950s in the Philadelphia area...","This is a way to reconnect with what were hopefully some of your fondest Christmas memories! For our family, it was THE Christmas show of its day. No Christmas season was complete without seeing it at least one time. In half an hour we young viewers anticipated the joys of a visit from Santa Claus, followed by a reverent telling of the birth of Jesus. In the intervening years since this program used to air, many more sophisticated Christmas shows came along to become our favorites. I was very happy, though, to be reunited with this reminder of simpler, happy times when my brother gave me a VHS copy recorded from his local PBS station some years ago. Now I am very pleased about this DVD release, which will preserve the program for future generations. Thanks for making it available, Amazon!"
5,Spirit of Christmas,We used to watch this show every year when I was a child. It would be repeated several times during the Christmas holiday.
3,Remembering how it use to be,"My husband was searching for this for years for his mother. She remembered it fondly and when he finally found it and gave it to her as a birthday gift we got to see what she was talking about. It doesn't have any ""bells and whistles"" and kids today would find it boring but it has such a nostalgic feel to it, it reminds you of how nice it was when things were simple and it holds a timeless heartwarming feel to it that made me really appreciate this simple Christmas classic."
4,memories,"This dvd brought back memories of my childhood. By today's standard it is laughable, but as a kid I never missed it each season. Thank you"
5,Lifting belt,"I can't really say anything negative about this belt. It is relatively comfortable, sturdy and does what it's supposed to. I use it during heavier leg or back workouts, and it definitely comes in handy. If you're looking for a reasonably priced lifting support, chances are you won't be disappointed with this purchase. I haven't really used many weightlifting belts before so my judgement may be a little off due to lack of camparison."
3,Runs a little small,Can't beat the price but as per the other review runs a little small. with a 33-36 waist would opt for large size. i bought the medium given a prior link that had stated it would cover this size range. Otherwise good product.
5,Good belt,"It’s a sturdy 4 inch wide weight lifting belt. I've had it for a few months now and it is holding up and doing its job. For heavy squats, deadlifts, and presses it helps keeps those nasty hernias and testicular micro blood vessel ruptures away. Also provides additional support to my lower back when lifting heavy weights. Its nylon so it’s easy to clean in the washer and the Velcro strip is wide and strong. Works for me, Nuff said!"
4,Nice basic belt for good price.,"The belt works well for all my heay lifts. I like the adjustablity of the velcro closure, as opposed to hloes in a leather belt. You can't go wrong with this belt. Very well made."
5,"This is a serious, secure, weightlifting belt","Don't let the velcro fool you, this is one serious weight lifting belt. I've used this belt frequently over the past 5 years and the velcro has not let loose in the gym one time. It has held firm even while squatting and dead lifting 400-450lbs.The belt itself is nylon, which makes it relatively flexible so it won't cut into your skin like a rigid leather belt will. Also, since this is secured with velcro, you can get it exactly as tight as you want it - no more, no less. With a standard belt you'll probably have to settle for an adjustment loop that's either too lose or too tight. For the casual lifter, this probably isn't a deal breaker. However when you are training near your maximum lift, you want a belt that is a bit too lose or a bit too tight can really throw you off.Either way, this is a very comfortable, flexible, strong workout belt that unlike most belts is infinitely adjustable."
4,Careful on sizing,"The belt is fine, but be careful on sizing. I have a 30"" waist so I bought the medium. It's so big, I have to wrap the tongue all the way around my back to get it to fit which doesn't feel good and is not a lot of fun to take off and put on. So I bought the small, which is so small I can't wear it. As you'll also notice, unlike the Valeo, they don't offer a sizing chart on this item."
4,Good protection for your back,This item is a must have if you are working out and worry about hurting your back.The belt is not for the muscle head only but can be used around the house if you are lifting up heavy items.
2,size matters,"When you order get, this product inn a size much larger than you would typically order. I wear a 33"" pnat waist size and the one that was supposed to fit barely attaches around my waist. Way undersized so order way bigger than you measure."
5,This is for our own collection.,"We are Vincent Price fans. This box has two movies that are favorites of my husband's and mine, neither one of which we have been able to find anywhere else."
3,More of a side story to the novel series,"Resident Evil: Underworld, the fourth installment in S.D. Perry's novelizations of the popular video game, finds the City of the Dead survivors (Leon and Claire) meeting up with Caliban Cove's survivors (Rebecca, David, and John) and infiltrating an underground Umbrella testing base. The group is thrown face first as would be test subjects against a handful of Umbrella's grotesque mutated beasts, and the novel ends with more of a whimper than a bang. Underworld is undoubtadly the least compelling installment in the novel series, and it works best as more of a side story to the events between City of the Dead and Nemesis. The stunning revelations about Trent towards the end of the book is worth the price of admission here alone, but otherwise keep this at the bottom of your Resident Evil novel wish list."
4,Resident Evil: Under-rated.,"Well, now! That was an interesting ending...No, I'm not gonna tell you.After reading City Of The Dead, I was expecting this book to reveal what the surviving S.T.A.R.S. would do in Europe, but this was an excellent follow-up book to Caliban Cove. I suggest reading at least that one before you read this one. But I'm not you.So go ahead. Read the series. Far too many people have turned their noses at this thrilling series already.Your adrenaline glands will hate you for it, but your brain will love you forever.Just don't read too hard, or your reaction time might suffer. Don't want to be eaten, do you?"
4,"""Underworld"" Over The Top","One gets the feeling that this series is, if nothing else, a travelogue disquised as horror novels. All this moving about is, at times, over the top. New locales, of course, provide a fresh batch of creepy critters in the ever expanding menagerie of Umbrella's offerings. Lurking and lurching beneath the sands of an American Southwest desert secret facility there are creatures that are as unnatural as they are unwholsome. Dacs, Scorps, Spitters and Hunters ... Oh my! Dorothy and Toto most likely would have found their journey through Oz much more harrowing had such denizens crept across the Yellow Brick Road. More exciting than this, though, is an enticing glimpse into the ever present and always mysterious Mr. Trent ... just enough for the faithful 'RE' followers to glimpse what is the driving forces behind the man, and Umbrella as well. An interestingly constructed story that leaves one wondering where the next novel will begin."
4,"Resident evil dino crisis, sort of.","The former members of STARS (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) barely escape yet another attack from Umbrella's henchmen and are eager to join their partners in Europe, but the mysterious Trent has different plans. It seems that Umbrella has a brand spanking new facility opening up in Utah and Trent wants it closed down, permanently. The rendevous in Europe is postponed and it's off to Utah the team goes. The fourth Resident Evil novel (and the second original story, not an adaptation of a pre-existing storyline) is a fun, monster heavy ride. The only thing missing are the zombies, but series fans should still enjoy it. I did. Recommended."
5,GOOD BOOK. GOOD GAME?,"Resident Evil: UnderWorld was a great book, but it wouldn't be a great game. It by-passes the part of killing zombies and such but adds mutated animals like the spitters (which are very dangerous in this book) and puts a flesh-hunrgy TYRANT called Fossil because of its looks. Otherwise its a must have book. Thats why I gave it 5 S.T.A.R.S.!"
4,this book was really a great book,I have all the books by this author.The book has sort of a different taste than the game but still makes me want to keep reading
5,THE BEST R.E BOOK I EVER READ!!!!,THE BEST RESIDENT EVIL BOOK I EVER READ. THERE AIN'T ZOMBIES BUT IT DONT MATTER IT IS STILL A EXTREMLY GOOD BOOK! A MUST READ GIVE IT AN AWARD!!!
3,Ho Hum,"I was hoping for more out of the fourt and final? novel by Perry. But was somewhat disappointed. Maybe with the release of the new games this fall the author can get back on track with more of the original RE ideas. All in all, the four novels were a plus for fans of RE."
2,When I got here there were forty six reviews!,"I'm surprised that there was forty six people who read the fourth novel. Personally, I read all the novels because I wanted to learn from Perry's mistakes.Perry gives a bad name to women writers."
5,Can You say die?,"This book had a fast begining to start off with. And although it is vague at times, it still good. After all, vaguness leaves room for the real imagination thinkers to work. When I first started reading this, I believed the premise and thought that this could've been a great movie. It has all the making's of it. (I think that was the writer's intention.) And you love this one gimick involving a experiment in survival of the fittest. Enjoy."
3,A so-so book that is a fill in between the games.,"I was a little dissappointed in this book. I had read all the other ones in the series and loved them. But this book really didnt do it for me. It didnt scare me like the other ones. I would read this book to keep you going on what is happening in the S.T.A.R.S lives, but dont expect to be freaked out."
5,"Good book, even though it's not based on a game.","Resident Evil: Underworld is a great book, it's very scary, (WARNING: Diapers and night light not included) there are new characters, new monsters, more action. Plus Trent shows up once or twice.So far, I've read this, Code Verionca, Nemesis, and I'm currently reading The Umbrealla Conspiracy, book one.This one is a original Res Evil novel like Calabain Cove and will probably never be made into a video game as there are no zombies, just grunts that Claire Redfeild, Rebecca Chambers, andthe British guy, David, kill.Even though there are no zombies, or at least I don't rememberany, there are alot of new mutants, including Terydacals, and afish-like dinosaur creature, and an evil guy, Mr. Blue.Well it's a good book, not the best, Nemesis is better, but this is very good."
5,Probably one for the best books for RESIDENT EVIL fans!,I read and own all of the first three books of resident evil by S.D. PERRY and they were great. The best was probably Umbrella Conspiracy. With Resident Evil :CODE VERONICA around the corner I and ordering this book right now!
5,Great book,Great book! It came packaged well and the seller shipped it quickly. There isnt much to say about it. A book is a book I guess! I would highly recommend for any fan of the games or the books by S.D. Perry
5,Really cool book!!,"This was a really good book and I certainly did enjoy it. It took me about half an hour to finish the book...because it was so good. S.D. Perry is a terrific writer and she IS a woman...so females rule!! It was very descriptive! Personally, I think Claire and Leon make a pretty cute couple. ;-)"
4,Rurouni Kenshin The Best Anime,"This is the best anime out there. I also have all the Samurai X movies. Samurai X if you dont know is the an anime of everything that happened before the series. I highly recomend them too. But they are both great because they have fighting, Conflict, freinds, and Romance. I watch the series on tv every time it comes on. I got this mainly to see all the stuff that they didn't let on tv and so I can watch it whenever I want."
5,FINNALY.,"I have been waiting for a box set for all these years because there is such so many DVD's,22 to be exact. I am a real fan of Rurouni Kenshin and Now I can finnaly get the whole T.V series easily but there are three box sets,Wandering Samurai, Legend of Kyoto and Tales of the Meiji also maybe coming out in the future the Jinchu Arc which is only on the manga for now so don't waste all your money just for this because the rest of them are a lot better. This is about a man named Himura Kenshin. He was one of the best assasin in Japan during the Revolution he became the Hitokiri Battousai, but when it was over he became a rurouni (wanderer). But when a young girl named Kaoru was getting angry at a imposter who also was named the Battousai she get's mad at the wrong person. Well anyway I am not gonna waste my time writing a long review so go get this box set right a way and make sure you have at least $150.00 with you because this box set is not exactly cheap."
5,little mature for cartoon network,"this first season is what they showed on Cartoon Network but it was edited at least some of it cause even on CT it look more like a show aimed at ages 12 older examples:Yahiko was showen nude when a boy walked in on him, Yahiko even said (he saw me butt naked).Kaoru and Megumi were about to bath in a hot springs water and she told the guys not to walk in on them that would sound more like sexual humer.When Kenshin first meat Kaoru he saw her taking a bathKenshin stepping in the women's bathing hot springs but naked he didn't even realise until Megumi and especially Kaoru being so shocked kept stairing down at his private.Even now and then very little blood would apear."
4,Fun Gum for Kids and Adults,"Living in the States, this was a fun thing to find a different Flavors of gum and the different textures! I especially liked the Pokemon stuff. Most of the other, I can find at local Asian Stores, since I live in a large Metro Area, but if you don't, you will find the flavors and shapes to be a nice ""difference"". I recommend this for Christmas and other occasions, for the ""under 15"" set."
5,Saw this when it first came out & still LOVE it!,"With all the crap coming out ad nauseum these days, it's a grave injustice The Class of Miss MacMichael still hasn't seen a (R1) DVD release. I first saw this motion picture at the cinema during its original theatrical release & enjoyed the film & have watched the VHS multiple times. I now long for a proper DVD treatment of this wonderful classic. I wish the distributors for The Class of Miss MacMichael would get their heads out of their asses & get the ball rolling, soon. The scene where Glenda Jackson (Miss MacMichael) has a showdown with Oliver Reed (Mr. Sutton), is electrifying & highly showcases the greatest work of Ms. Jackson's career! Rosalind Cash turns in a wonderful performance as Miss MacMichael's fellow colleague & good friend, as does Michael Murphy as Miss MacMichael's love interest."
4,"launched ok, chute didn't open","This was a little more work to assemble than I remembered from my youth. It launched great but the parachute didn't open. The rocket got caught in a tree about 50' up in the air. These things happen, but that didn't make my son feel better. We'll do it again."
2,Pity the fine dancers ...,"One can only feel pity for the fine dancers who got involved in this 'tacky' production with it's shabby settings (""let's put on a ballet in our barn, kids""), gaudy lighting (like a cheap carnival)mind numbing visual effects (wretched for ANY era) and confusing cutting (things appear and disappear at will) that is guaranteed to confuse both children and adults. All the best scenes are ruined by the incessant twinkling star special effects. Pass this one and (since there isn't really a good one on DVD) buy the audio CD and imagine a performance worthy of this fine score."
1,Ultimate Sticker Books not so hot,"I really don't like the Ultimate Sticker Book series books. I've bought several for my 4 year-old twins and found them to be very difficult for the kids to use. The pages are plain, unexciting and text-heavy -- not good for pre-readers. For pre-schoolers I highly recommend the sticker books by Roger Priddy (My Giant Sticker Activity Book is a favorite)."
2,"""This isn't fun anymore.""","I agree with other reviewers. The text needs to be edited down to more high points and less blah blah blah.Also -- and this is my chief complaint -- there are so many stickers and they're not labeled (for pages 3 and 4) like other, better sticker books. Sometimes for the first few dinosaurs, we had to search through hundreds of dinosaur images. And many of them look alike, with the tail up or the mouth open in a certain way. So it's tough to find the right sticker, even as an adult. We searched together for about 10 dinosaurs and then my son said, ""This isn't fun anymore"" and put the book down. I agreed."
3,"Very detailed pictures, instructions lacking",Stickers all jumbled together with no key as to which page they are to go on. Very frustrating for my 4 year old to not be able to put them in the right places. We put them away for a while. Maybe more 5 or 6 to 9.
1,the secret is to figure out why anyone reads this book,"i will be honest and tell you i couldn't finish the book. and it's not long - it just was not worth it. the ""secret"" is obvious from the first page and it is pure drivel as you plod through the first half of the book with the heroine as she tries to figure it out.so maybe there is another gem of a secret in the second half of the book that i don't find out because i never finished it. but given the first half of the book, i can't imagine there is enough to create a multi-layered secret.the philosophic premise of the book is so flawed from the outset (that clones are EXACT replicas - physically, emotionally, intelligently, etc. to the point that they essentially repeat ""history"") that it makes the rest of the book predictable and boring. it is too bad because the premise and the original question have great potential to be fascinating."
3,intersting subject,"The subject of Eva Hoffman's book, The Secret, is certainly thought provoking. The question of how an individual can cope with the fact of being a clon can be fascinating. The situation of mother and daughter so much alike raises interesting psychological situations.Ms. Hoffman in her book touches all the right problems, but somehow she leaves it all on the surface, never daring to explore the emotions of the characters in deep.The book feels more like an account of events in the life of the heroine and it never reaches the level of a great novel."
1,Just boring!,"This is a dreadful book: A girl, Iris the clone, whining through 263 pages how bad it is to be a clone. Eventually I just skipped huge parts of the book because it was just more of the same. To top it all off: Finally she finds some individuality by meeting Mr. Right. The least I had hoped for was the resolution, that it is not ALL in the genes, but no, not in this book."
2,Too Wordy !!!,Not what you expect - I found myself skipping through long drawn out paragraphs and still following along. This is a book that could have been condensed into a short story.Is it Enviroment or Genetics that designs our personality? If you believe in Enviroment than you will be dissapointed in this book.
2,Potent & disturbing maglignancy Prof?,"Sorry, but this book was about as even handed as a Pat Robertson talk about Clinton. You know you are not geting a fair hearing when such words as ""this potent & disturbing maglignancy."" Please! Trust me, as a Pagan myself I know quite well that it is for the most part (95%) from this century, And so what? It's the truth & kindness that is found in the movement that matters. All religions have falsehoods at their base. Look at Christianity. With it founder who say that he would be back before the people hearing him had died...2000 years the man who never was is still not back, but a history of blood, death & horror is there, with followers like Mr. Davis who is ready, willing & able to come up with reasons why there has not quite yet been enough. This book is a maglignancy itself that I am sure will be used by the thugs of falsehood with glee."
1,Bias Unmasked,"I read this book a few years ago, as I was interested in the pagan movement and wanted critical material on it - not for an agenda, but just for my own curiosity.Other reviewers have noted that the bias is evident from the cover itself. Quite frankly, I came away from this book respecting very thing he was trying to debunk, and it spurred me on to read more indepth on some his targets like Shelley and Goethe.The bottom line on a book like this is that is fueled by a bias that makes everything within it suspect. While this book does provide a somewhat deeper analysis of the issue, readers are recommended _Triumph of the Moon_ by Ronald Hutton instead. Hutton is both unbiased and a more eminent scholar - he also makes the ""goddess as product of romanticism"" case in far fewer pages."
1,Polemic posing as scholarship,"A look at the publisher's web page is enough to give you an idea of what to expect from this book. It claims to represent the true conservative view and accuses other conservative publishers of giving in to sensationalism and ""scandal-mongering."" Its booklist is heavily geared to works of extreme anti-feminism. So the author's claims to a balanced and scholarly view are hardly believable. This is not a book for any thoughtful reader to take seriously."
1,Wait a minute,"most scholarly investigations of paleolithic society accept that they can't be sure what artifacts that depict women mean, but accept that it indicates the importance of women and/or a goddess in that society. Also, they don't believe that the societies were matriarchal, but rather had equality of the sexes."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book because it was recommended by a friend as a ""funny' book. As other readers have mentioned, indeed it does not take long to read but I found it completely stupid and with absolutely no point. I would never bother again reading another of this author's books."
2,It Wasn't For Me,"I have really enjoyed Scott Cole's ""Tai Chi for Beginners"" and thought I might like this DVD as well. The movements are all almost the same as on the beginners' DVD with a few extras. Unless you are already familiar with these movements, it might be a bit challenging knowing how to do them. His instruction on this DVD is a bit rushed.Even though I am somewhat familiar with the movements, I still felt rushed. The idea is to do the movements slowly at first and then at an increased tempo. It got my heart rate up slightly, but mostly, I felt some strain on my knees doing these movements in a hurry.I choose to do Tai Chi for the enjoyment of the movements, tranquility and flow. This DVD will not provide that."
4,Nice Energy,This video is a great start for anyone interested in Tai Chi and Qigong....I have been working out with this video both alone and with friends and they love it too... You can feel the energy the first day with the gentle movements.
1,Boring and not very good for weight loss,"This video was very boring and didn't really do much to get my heart rate up for weight loss. He takes you through a series of exercises, which in my opinion are too complicated to get the first time and he teaches them. Then the video changes to him doing them very fast, not giving any more instructions and not even telling you which exercise is next so it's up to you to remember the exact way to do the exercise, and remember when to change to the next one. Complete waste of money in my opinion. The Tai Chi for Beginners was much better, but still pretty boring. Unless you already know Tai Chi or have an incredible memory, don't get this."
2,not for beginners,"If you are going to title a DVD ""discover..."" anything - then it should teach you the basics of the thing first. 10 minutes would have been enough. Not a training program you want to start if you haven't studied Tai Chi before. It was going too fast with minimal movement break-downs."
5,Great songwriting!!,This CD is revolutionary...if you don't have it you need to find it and buy it! Awesome music.
4,Used but great condition,A little pricey for a CD but I especially love the American Boys Choir that is on this CD. Arrived on time and in great condition.
1,MOLOKO BITERS,"i really dig this song dont get me wrong but gotdamn ....boomkat is totally biting moloko's style on this.....the singing and even the production.......i would suggest moloko for the real thing...... any of their lps.....especially ""things to make and do"" and ""do you like my tight sweater"" i still like this track alot but i wouldve liked it better if it wasnt such a jack move. hope the album isnt as bad of a roisin murphy bite as this song is......booyaa!"
4,Used to adore this song.,This used to be one of my favorite songs.I don't listen to them anymore.. but I believe this album has a remix on it. That was pretty great too.
5,Boomkat kicks ass!!!!,"Even though there are only two tracks on this CD, they both kick all...everywhere in the whole world. Manning is a genius. She is creating awesome music. The CD is two different versions of her single ""Wreckoning"" My favorite is number two because I love DJ mixes. But the original version is kick...too, dont get me wrong! I would suggest that YOU, yes YOU, buy this CD...buy her full CD. I'm sure it will be amazing as well....ENJOY!"
3,Una recensione,Questo piccolo libro e divertente perche l'autrice raconta le storie breve di la sua vita. Lei usa le parole e la grammatica semplice che si impara mentre il corso elementare del italiano. Lo studente qui vuole avere pui pratica con la lingua si piaceranno le teme.
4,A Good Read,"I found that Jean Farinelli's, ""Diario della studentessa Jean"" filled a void in the outside reading material available for students of Italian who are no longer beginners, but not quite ready for texts with more extensive vocabularies. It was a brilliant idea to have Professor Schlempp supervise the writing so as to ensure the linguistic accuracy of the material. The stories are real-life experiences told in a humorous way. The author's obvious delight in discovering and ultimately mastering some of the intricacies of the Italian language is infectious. It must be in her genes!"
5,Diario della studentessa Jean,"This charming ""diary"" of a student of the Italian language is a delightful tool for learning the language on an easy, conversational and every day level. I wish such a book had existed when I undertook the study a number of years ago. By becoming involved with the adventures of Jean, Roscoe and ""Ralph"", it is possible to follow the action without knowing every word until one sees the context in which it is used. I recommend it to all students of Italian. Grazie!"
4,Delightful for Italian language neophytes,"This charming collection of personal encounters and interactions written by a mature Italian ""student"" gives you the flavor of the Italian experience as well as the opportunity to expand your language skills along with Jean. Perhaps it deserves 5 stars...but my own Italian isn't sharp enough to be certain! In any case, I was able, imperfectly, to navigate the language sufficiently to appreciate the stories. It's a great gift for anyone studying Italian, young or older."
4,"well made, fun toy","Chipper was delivered promptly and is a well constructed soft stuffed chipmunk. So far it has stood up to lots of play time, including a day in the elementary classroom (including outside for recess)."
2,Beware - Bugs!,"Everything was fine until about 2/3rds of the way through. At that point, I ran into some rather obvious bugs. First, it refused to acknowlege that I'd completed a quest - even the obvious steps like ""Enter the Citadel"" would not receive the checkmark. Then, it fell into a mode where I couldn't hit any monsters. Swinging just fine, but not able to actually hit anything. I tried rebooting from a saved game, but still ran into the same problems. Lost all motivation to start from the beginning with a new character..."
4,Great RPG!,"The storyline is solid enough to be on a computer game and the graphics are up to par. The music is the outstanding and came out straight out of the dungeon siege original computer game. I really do enjoy playing this game the only problem I have, and believe me when I say it is not a major issue, is the loading time during multiplayer. Very nice buy, and one I do not regret. I will probably finish this game with each one of the 3 characters included. Extremely easy to pick up on the run and do a quest or two between patients."
3,Load times are agony.,"Make sure you save often. I've had the game freeze several times while loading. I have also had it freeze in the middle of a battle, and had my character get stuck beside a wall (had to turn the game off). Overall it's a fun game if you like mashing a button repeatedly to swing a weapon and hitting another button to fling a fireball (there are different weapons and armor to collect, and you can shoot lightning and ice). You are given a quest by some bloke, go to the targeted area, fight your way through the monsters, pick up loot, find the item you're looking for, and go back to get another quest. It's an easy game and getting repetitive but worth ten bucks for a time killer. Kids will like it. All I've seen that would give it the teen rating is animated blood, and on the psp it's a fairly small amount of animated blood."
2,Below Expectations,"This game was not as good as the 4.5 stars it had on the ratings. It is very 2-dimensional, simple and boring. The view of the characters is very zoomed out which is not a great experience of the action. If you want a well-designed game with great graphics and not so easy to beat (even in regular mode) try God of War or 300."
5,$10 for a Dungeon Siege title? Deal!,"I will admit that I prefer Dungeon Siege II over Diablo II on the PC so this will obviously be a biased review.This game is a perfect example of how PSP stands for PORTABLE. It's simply a portable Dungeon Siege game. I don't know how else to describe it. If you are familiar with the series or Diablo then you know what I'm talking about. If you don't, the think of this as a 3rd person real-time RPG. The game play and graphics are great however it comes at a cost.....small boards with load times in between. If you are impatient, you will get frustrated quickly. Since I am not, I had no problem waiting the few seconds of loading after dealing with an area in the game.Parents: This is a dark fantasy game (like Dungeons and Dragons). I would say ages 8+ would be acceptable but some may want to wait till 10 or 12. Please be responsible."
5,Quality Hack n' Slash,"This is really a good game. It's a couple years old now, and I just found out about it recently. With Dungeon Siege 3 coming out sometime on the horizon, I looked at Amazon to find Dungeon Siege 2 as I had never played through it. After searching, I came across this gem of a game. Overall a good story, and each character has their own reasons for adventuring. Combat is somewhat like a button masher, but it's fun and rewarding. About the only downfall is slow load times. Aside from that, the game is definitely worth owning."
3,Puts You to Sleep,"I really hate to knock this game. I do not want to. However, for the price and the description of the game, it should be better than it is. It is soooo monotonous and very easy. This would be a great RPG for the teens and younger. Yes, I am older than that.The graphics are ok. The number of quests are many. Plenty of weapons and spells to get your hands on and use.What is bad are the load times. They are horrible (PSP Slim). When clearing areas of beasts (some quests require), the quest is accomplished but the beasts keep automatically reappearing. The on screen map is nice, but instead of it showing you where you have been, it shows you everything within the level you are in whether you were there or not yet. So too easy to know what is around each and every corner before you even get there.I could keep going. It is ok fun, but compared to other RPG type games, I recommend others if you want a challenge and do not want to get bored."
5,Great game. Amazing production,"This game is excellent and well produced:It has a terrific story that keeps unfolding. The visuals are strong and appealing and complex. The characters clothes changes with each item (weapon, armour, accessory, etc) it acquires (there are hundreds of items). The character is well developed. It has charateristics that can change as you develop. There are dozens of types of characters to fight.Before Dungeon Seige, Lord of the Rings was my favourite game. I tried at least 10 other games since Lord of the Rings before I found this one that I found to be just as engaging. Highly Reccomended."
2,Room for Improvement...A Lot of Room,"I was only able to get to the third stage (LV.3?) of this game before my PSP just completely shut down. I cant say how much fun it was, or how great the customizations were because it froze so much. I played for a good hour, and in that time it froze 3 to 4 times and bogged down my poor PSP so bad it just shut itself off, twice. I took the game out, and am swearing to never play it again. Maybe there's an upgrade needed? Or maybe its just a glitchy game. Either way, I guess I got what I paid for. Try it, maybe not everyone will have this problem..."
5,Nice fat windshield,"I got the 19"" solar windshield for my 1998 Harley Softail FXST. It's 19"" from the headlight cutout to the top of the windshield, overall height is 25"", and width is 23"". I'm 6 feet tall and this windshield is just about the right height, the top is below my line of sight so I can see over it easily when it gets rained on. My only problem with it is the turbulence but I've talked to other riders with windshields and they have that same complaint. It's real nice windshield and it was easy to install."
3,Looks good,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
3,"One fit, the other was malformed.","These are not exactly the same ski inserts that originally came with my Nordic Track Sequoia, but they are better than nothing...and much better than anything that I could have made. My only compliant is that one of the inserts was malformed/ too bulbous to fit into the opening properly...it was not worth sending it back in for an exchange due to shipping and handling costs."
4,Vag Politics,"Very interesting story about a midwife's plight. It amazes me how ignorant we are in this country about the value and benefit of a midwifery model of care. And how we, as women, are OK with this. This book *should* make you want to stand up and take back your right to birth without politics involved."
3,This may not be what you expect,"I expected this music to be played on traditional instruments. It didn't say it was, it didn't say it wasn't. Just an assumption on my part. Two of the three discs are synthesized versions of kabbalistic music without words. Traditionally they would have had words to them. The third disc is a re-mastered version of a kabbalistic master chanting the music, so you can hear what the originals actually sounded like, which is very different than the first two discs. The synthesized versions sound to me a lot like new age massage music. So it is nice for babies as other reviewers mentioned or maybe massage, etc. I'm not sure how far it is from the actual kabbalistic music as I am no expert. -Lucy"
5,Classic,These melodies rip straight to the heart. By talking to your feelings these songs prove their authenticity. Who better to compose them than the greatest Kabbalist of the 20th century Yehuda Ashlag the Baal HaSulam.
4,Quality,"A nice bright bulb that matches my headlights. I like the Sylvania bulbs, they arent as blue as some bulbs but they have a nice bright light."
2,"short life, not worth the trouble","If you have every changed the fog light bulbs in a 2000-2002 trans am you know its not something you want to do often. My stock bulbs were fine. The silver stars did project a better light given how deep the bulbs are in the front fascia. But, one burned out after 1 year which was only 5000 miles mostly daytime driving. Not worth the hassle of install given the lifespan."
1,Very disappointing,"When purchasing this product, I took in consideration Sylvania's market share and quality history. However, upon installation, the bulb burned out within the 1st week. $20 down the drain. If you are gambler, I recommend spinning the wheel. If not, look into another more reliable product."
5,Super,"I don't get flu shots but I use this and I can tell you, other than a small bout of food poisoning, I've not been sick. Even when I had the bad food episode, taking this helped. I bought several bottles and gave some to my daughter who is always sick. She has not been sick since taking this. One a day works and the price is right. I feel my immune system is stronger now than ever."
5,Helpful as part of Lyme Treatment Protocol,"Through trial and error, we have determined that GSE is a very important supplement in treating Lyme Disease, yeast overgrowth and possibly parasitic co-infections. We have noticed substantial improvement on GSE and a significant decline off of this supplement. We have carefully researched the studies on GSE and have determined that the benefit far out weighs any risk (so long as using a reputable brand and supplier). We found a study showing that Grapefruit Seed Extract is a powerful in vitro agent against motile and cystic forms of Borrelia burgdorferi sense alto."
2,It don't work,I haven't notice any improvement. I'm been using it for about 3 weeks. It doesn't change anything. I hope my comments helps.
2,WEAK FAN,I bought this fan to keep me cool while taking pictures on my wedding day in Cabo. The fan part creates the weakest breeze. Definitely not worth it!
2,Weak fan,"The fan generates a weak breeze, but it acceptable for such a small gadget. The mist is not what I thought it would be though. It's actually a cheap squirting mechanism that squirts a bit of water. No mist."
1,What a waste,"Really a disappointment. I bought for golf in our now 100+ heat index temps. The fan barely put out any air and the ""mister"" was .... well, it just sprayed water on your face, which might have been refreshing but the water was hot so it wasn't really a ""treat"". I even put in ice water, and I do understand there is no coolant in the unit, but I expected the water to be cooled by the fan motion. Nope., I am sending back, and normally I think I deserve some results from purchases like this and I just keep the item. Not this time...it is going back.I did buy the neck wraps that are soaked in water and those are pretty good for relief."
3,"My rating is not accurate, I have not been able to test item","I have not had a chance to try this, but the size of it is great. The shipping was a little slow, but not too bad."
4,Not bad!,"This little thing is powerful and very easy to carry around, it's so much more convenient than the gigantic squirt bottles with fans on them you can get at walmart or whatever. The only problem was, because they have to make it so compact, it can only hold a very small amount of water at a time. The squirting mechanism is very good at spraying a very fine but perfect mist so it doesn't waste all your water in two squirts, but you still find yourself refilling a lot. Still worth it over the alternative in my opinion."
5,Wind in your finger tips.,"Great little gadget! I used it on my trip to Egypt and on the horrible ride back where we had a broken air conditioning system, or I might have gone made. It only takes one battery! Can't hurt yourself on the blades, and it will store nicely in your hand, pocket or bag. I keep it in my backpack all the time! Highly recommended."
5,A Classic Story,"This is a remarkable book by a great photographer. Robert Capa, as has been said, invented himself. This is evident in this book: as a Hungarian living the the United States during war time (technically an enemy alien) and broke, he managed to effortlessly have a job offered to him, get a passport (as if by magic) and become an American war photographer.Mr. Capa wrote well for someone who learned English but his marvelous photographs included in this book say much more than the words on the printed page. Some of the photographs were familiar and others were new for me. They are touched with compassion and so involved with the scene as if the camera eye were able to explore the world invisible.In sum, a wonderful book to read and treasure for Capa's outlook on life, his experiences and his unique photographs."
4,Fantastic Read...,"Capa was not only one of the greatest photographers who ever lived, he was also an amazing storyteller and human being. This book shows his humour and humanity in the world's darkest hour.45 years after his death, he is still sorely missed."
4,War Stories With No Insights,"The preface to the book points out that Capa originally wrote it with the intent of it being turned into a movie. The result is an engagingly good collection of war stories.If, however, you're interested in finding out more about Capa, why, for example, he continually went back into harms way or why he let his relationship with Pinky languish so he could take more war pictures, or what he was trying to capture with his photographs, anything personal at all, you won't find it here.Instead you'll find some well told war stories (although at times he tries too hard). You'll also be treated to a collection of his photographs. You just won't find the man here."
5,"Well written, easy to understand",This books reviews the control strategies of HVAC Systems. There are various control strategies and this book illustrates them with system drawings.The first 2 parts that introduce the control theory and the control devices could be boring for an experienced engineer however useful for a student or a graduate.
5,Can it be? Another DBZ movie?,"Did they really do it? It is a movie, or the notorious Bardock T.V. Special that aired in Japan. I haven't seen it, but I read about. To make a brief summary, this may explain the end of Planet Vegeta. And I am pretty sure it also explains why Goku was sent to Earth & it may go a liitle bit more in depth on the scuffle between Bardock & Frieza. None the less, it is probably considered a movie. Which is a must buy!"
3,DBZIC-[http://dbzic.tripod.com] - Bardock Review,"This movie is about the history of Goku and how he was born and how he ended up on Earth. Frieza is realizing that The ""Saiyan"" are getting stronger and stronger after every battle and might be a pest later on so he decides to eliminate them right now. So he blows up Planet Vegeta (Where all the saiyans live) and all the Saiyans die including Bardock, Gokus father. The Only surviors are Brolly,Goku,Vegeta,Raditz,Nappa, and this one other guy that escaped with Brolly. ...."
5,This Movie Is A Blast,"If you only like dragonball z for the super sayjins then this isn't the movie for you, but if you are a major fan this is great background for the series. It basically tells the story of Gokou's father Bardock and how he and Vegita's father were killed by Freeza when he blew up the sayjin home world. It also shows small parts about how Gokou and Vegita came to be and how they ended up on earth. All in all its a great movie."
5,Great Product,I love this style of socket holder. Handle makes it easy to carry around and the strong magnets keep your sockets in place. This product definitely keeps my tool box organized.
1,not as good as No More Hotels In Paris by Cynthia Lynn,"This book is an enjoyable read, but so is the newest edition (June, 2000) of the book, No More Hotels In Paris: How To Find Alternative Accommodations by Cynthia Lynn, which is loaded with much more factual information and as well more about the lifestyle of the Parisian--and the publisher, Newjoy Press offers periodic updates on the apartment rental listings and other changes that may occur which the reader should know, all at no charge. And it's very portable too."
4,Even better now than then!,"The first episode, A taste of Armagedeon, was very powerful considering the Vietnam war in the 60's. Historically, the political issues being presented were wonderful! While part of the episode, in a simplified view, seemed like a sophisticated game of Battleship, the message behind the show was powerful. The second episode, Space Seed, is perhaps even more chilling today than it was 30 years ago. With the genetic revolution within reach, this ""Eugenics War"" and the sophisticated Khan are more real now than then. Kudos to Roddenberry for having that foresight. The episode allows the viewer to see a different side of the coin of the genetic revoultion. Bottom line, with the superb audio and video transfers, the disc is a must have!"
5,A Keeper! Among the Very Best Eps of the First Season!,"If you are picking and choosing the best volumes to keep, this one is indispensable. This volume is a must-have for ""Space Seed"" alone but thankfully, ""A Taste of Armageddon"" is also an excellent episode. In ""Space Seed"" we get an introduction to Khan Noonian Singh, the protagonist in what was to arguably become the best classic Trek movie ever. Ricardo Montalban turns in an excellent performance as Singh, a superhuman and the product of eugenics gone wrong awaken from a 200-year slumber.In the other ep, we get a very strong statement against war in which a society insists that its members commit suicide to maintain an uneasy ""peace"" which effectively becomes like a real-life game of Battleships except that ""casualties"" are mathematically decided via computer. When Kirk and the Enterprise end up as ""casualties"" Kirk has to find a way to break the cycle.Highly recommended."
5,"Video Transfer is excellent, Great 5.1 Dolby Audio",One of the greatest episodes. The video and audio transfer were excellent.
5,Armegeddon & Khan!,"""A Taste of Armegeddon"" is a very well written episode about 2 planets that are fighting a war with computers with real casualties. ""Space Seed"" See the TOS episode that inspired ""Star Trek II"""
1,Loose,Not a very good story line. Just a series of events happening in a airport with little tying the events to a central storyline. Mostly seems like production tried to capatilize in the popularity of actress Choi Ji Woo. Many close up shots of her in the series so if you are a Choi Ji Woo fan you will probably like her performance but will be disappointed in the quality of the storyline. Add to that the English translation in my box set was so terrible during the second half of the series that it was hard to understand much of the plots.
4,They just work,I use these for personal protection classes to help my students get used to quick reloads with a speedloader. These are much better than the plastic ones since they have a decent weight.
2,Beware! This is not the 60's garage/psych comp of the same name!,"Apparently there are 3 very different albums with this same title out there. Because there is no tracklist on the page for this and because I wasn't yet aware of the multiple albums, I bought it, and was quite surprised when I put it on my stereo and out blasted techno! Of course, then I couldn't return it because it was open. So be very careful you are getting the disc you intend to."
3,Don't really need it...,"Didn't really require this book, but for its price it was good back in the day.Got a 700/800 in Math portion of the SAT though, so it can't hurt."
3,Five stars if you want a 1300 one star if you want a 1600,"Don't bother with this book if you're even close to being a math enthusiast. If you are you would know all this material implicitly. There are only 130 problems total and even a low-grade virtuoso of the mathematical philosophies could finish the problems in a couple hours. The people who should be getting this book are those who have waited until the last minute to prepare for the SAT. Don't even bother with this for the PSAT. If you wait until the last minute to prepare for the PSAT and need this book, you aren't going to make the cutoff (for the National Merit Scholarship program). Believe me.You have to invest months of assiduous practice to significantly improve quickie quantatative problem solving skills. A book like this would just be a starting point. I would suggest the fatter and more challenging problem books from Barron's, Arco, Schaum's, etc. Solve 50 problems a night for six months or a year."
3,Kinda fun.,"I love trains and love strategy games. This fit the niche quite well. The only problem is that 3 games later (~4 hours per game), I've pretty much mastered it and there's not much more of interest. It is really a game of racing to lay tracks (either yourself or through acquisition). There are some cool political and other influential things you can do to make things interesting against your opponents along the way. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I certainly wasn't captivated very long. Graphics are okay, nothing to write home about."
5,Defintly get this game,"i liked the game because instead of the same old ""goblins and orcs"", it's the FBI and Newspapers.I think it is well worth the money."
1,Outdated,"This book was written in 1986 and, by my estimation, was outdated when it was written. No updating has been done in 14 years. This means that numerous tools and materials we use every day were not covered. This is the worst book I have purchased from Amazon."
5,Good background for the novice,"The other reviewer found this book outdated, and perhaps it is not for an intermediate or advanced woodworker. But I found it very helpful in explaining the basics for a novice. The introductory chapters on grades of wood, reading plans, etc. give a lot more background information than most other beginning woodworking books I've looked at. The book also discusses the differences between working with wood, plywood, and particle board. I like the fact that it tells how to do things using hand tools (for those of us who can't afford to spend thousands of dollars for a shop full of power tools in order to begin our first project). The book also explains how to make joints using several different kinds of tools. The book is easy to read, but could have more figures/pictures for some techniques. I would recommend it for anyone who is just starting out in woodworking."
5,The Good Old Way,"You can learn more than you think from Sam Allen. Written in 1986, learn how the experts who valued quality over time saving techniques. Learn the right way and from a real pro, and understand why you must do things the right way."
3,why this item is not good,This item only goes two miles.They mite say they are good for skiing and hiking but the trees reduce the miles. thank you for reading this!do not bye them
4,A traditional flute enhanced by exhaled vocal wailing,"Imagine a traditional flute enhanced by exhaled vocal wailing and you have an idea of the duality of sound featured in Bailo Bah's FULA FLUTE: a deep-toned, haunting flute enhanced further by the player's actual vocal injections from breathing .Likely to prove compelling to any listener of the wailing tambin flute style: a specialty audience steeped in West African heritage."
4,I'm afraid of the dark NOW!,"After reading this book I am not able to turn the light out to sleep. This is like Mary Higgins Clark with a evil, evil twist. I loved it!!!! I hope this book has a sequel."
1,Title is wrong and misleading,"The title is wrong and borders on intentionally misleading since there is no season 3 (rumors abound though). This is episode 13 from season 1. My son and daughter would have paid for this unasked if they found it and I didn't have their access limited. Please fix the title though I am curious as to how much money has been garnered from this ""error."""
5,Great entertainment,"Ever since my toddler started to watch this DVD a year ago, she has loved it. It gets her singing and dancing in the living room. Best of all, I've not gotten tired of hearing any of the songs. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a toddler that loves music."
5,Dancing Wiggles,My 2 year old and 5 month old love this DVD. We put it in the DVD player in the car for long trips and they clap and my wife and I sing along. Fun for the whole family.
3,New type of music for my girls,"My girls hadn't been exposed to Beatles type music before, and they seemed to take to it pretty well. The music seemed a little different from what we are used to from the Wiggles, but my girls (ages 2 and 3) seemed to enjoy it, especially the 3 year old. However, in the grand scheme of things I don't think they liked this DVD as well as some of the others."
2,Wiggles want to grow up,"This DVD does not touch my 3 year old at all. Are you growing up, Wiggles? We do not keep up. They gave up the skivvies, traded them in for more fancy looks, there seems to be more budget for DVD, which should've been good... ""wobblie camel"" and ""barking dog"" from years ago sounds better. And offered better dancing. I do not rate the second half of the video, we never made it there. I also think, music recording/mixing seems screwed to me: vocals fade while instruments too loud on many songs. And too busy. Guys overplayed in the studio. Children need more distinct vocals to learn the songs. And, yes, too fast on that one mexican rythm. Wows to Sam, though. He is a great actor and singer. We love Sam and Captain. I mean, we like all the guys, just not this dvd."
2,This did NOT make the kids want to dance,"I run a daycare in my home that's currently hosting children ages 9 mos. - 4 years old. We LOVE the Greg & Steve Big Fun video - the kids are ardently involved in singing and dancing along for the whole video. Needing more variety, I read the reviews on this Wiggles video and thought it sounded equally as engaging. I was so surprised when watching it with the kids: a series of performed and digitally altered dances that made no attempt to get the kids up and moving. As a smattering of different styles of dance and a variety of music, it was okay, but honestly boring to watch for all of us. I'm returning it. I think live performance videos are the way to go."
2,The Excitement Fades Fast,"We bought this on the strength of one TV episode (the first 20 minutes of the DVD) . Watching it all the way through, this is by far the weakest Wiggles DVD of the six we own. We just logged in to Amazon expecting to see poor reviews for 'Feel Like Dancing' and are quite surprised by the high score and rave reviews. Save for a few of the songs, this DVD is terribly boring. We're not sure why the Wiggles, or many of the reviewers, feel that children will feel compelled to dance to ballet, the waltz, and slow square dancing. Our 5 year old daughter and 18 month old son were entertained for the first few songs, then bored for most of the second half. Not sure how well this will entertain on our two 1200+ mile road trips this summer."
1,"Get the Original Wiggle DVDs, they're much better than this one!","This is T.Lin's daughter~When I was little, I grew up with the original Wiggles with Greg, the lead yellow man! They had vibrant kid friendly songs that were really easy to sing-a-long with! My mom wanted to provide my baby brother with the same experience I had with the wiggles, but when we saw this DVD, it was really disappointing. It was kind of boring, with grown-ups dressed as cats, I mean, what the heck? This is for kids! It wouldn't matter if you didn't know the wiggles before, but you should get the original instead. Even though the earlier DVD's graphics were not elaborate, the contents were much more kid friendly. I would recommend the earlier seasons, DVDs, and CDs to anyone. The newer songs are repetitive and dull.P.S.- watch the previous live shows on DVD... your kid will be bouncing along with it! Trust me, I know what fun means to kids, and they will like the originals better!"
1,wasn't what i expected,"I haven't been a fan of the wiggles long but now that my 18month old is watching shows we have found this movie, right now its a little old for her and it doesn't keep her attention, the actual show is what she likes and I found this movie to be well kinda annoying and we haven't watched it again i had no idea it was music clips and not the actual show. I have no idea who the wiggle is who is in the yellow? We are use to anthony we were confused and disappointed, maybe in a few months we will try it again."
1,waste of money,"My son loved the wiggles. It was the only thing he would watch. Now that Greg is gone, none of the new ones keep his attention. They all seem to have a different vibb coming from them. Sam is a good singer but I'm guessing with a new singer and WB taking over the videos they just aren't the same. I own ever older wiggle but I will no longer buy the new ones. I read reviews and thought this one might be better and maybe they just needed to find a grove with all the new changes but it isn't working. I personally think it has become to digital enchanced for a child. The wiggles are not as much of it as they were or should be."
1,Bores the kids and parents!,"This movie stinks! We have lots of wiggles movies, but this new version (with Sam instead of Greg) is the pits. I don't recommend this at all. go with one of the classics like Wiggly Party!"
1,Boring song remakes from the 60's- more for adults not the kids,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT... Not only does it not have the typical bouncy kids songs, they are mostly song remakes from the 60's. NOT kids songs! And they are slower songs.AND what kid wants to dance a waltz or a slow polka? Totally geared to amuse the parents in my opinion. First dvd I've gotten with 'Sam Wiggle' and now I'll not buy anymore with him whether rated good or not! My son loves the Wiggles, and this dvd does NOT hold his attention, in fact he brought me his shoes which means he wants to go outside and play!"
1,not songs kids would enjoy,I had not watched the Wiggles before but my 2 year old talked about them from daycare. Bought this video because she loves dancing and singing. This was one of the worst videos we have ever watched! I shouldve done more research on the songs because they are not very good songs for young children like I had hoped. She was so bored with this DVD. I think we are done with the Wiggles.
3,"Music great, visuals just ok","The good: this DVD has some incredibly catchy songs. The title song (Leo Sayer looks exactly the same!) and Shimmie Shake will have you singing & dancing around the house for days. Really, really good!The bad: This DVD features backup dancers waaaaay too much. It used to be cute when the band had kids in their videos. Now, the adult dancers dominate the screen. My kids find that very, very annoying.They especially dislike the several songs that have no words, but just feature dancers. They'd much rather see kids in the videos.One other thing - we love the Wiggles but their costumes in this DVD are kind of embarrassing!"
5,Great entertainment,"Packed with catchy tunes... our kids love it! Several songs/routines we have seen on the tv show - however, this is a great compilation."
3,Wiggles Dancing,"It is o.k, more graphics than the older stuff. I'm probably just so accustomed to the older ones that it seemed a little weird with lots of graphic backgrounds vs. live stage like appearance. New guy seems to be a good fit. o.k but got a bit boring after a while same singing and dancing throughout. I like mixing it up a bit more to hold their attention. Mother of 2 age 5 and 2"
5,my daughter loves this!,"My days-away-from-being-3 year old daughter LOVES this video. It was the first Wiggles video we watched and out of the three she's now seen, this one is by far her favorite. She jumps around with them and while she can't keep up with the lyrics, she pretends to sing along which is super cute. This was my first experience with The Wiggles and I admit, I'm sold - and so is my daughter."
4,Wiggles: You make me Feel like Dancing,"Another favorite. Can't get my two year old grandson to stop playing it. He especially likes ""Shimmy Shake"". It's constantly ""Dance Grandma""."
1,trick my what? episode 8,trick my what? thats what it was suppose to be. but someone messed up and put a trick my truck episode in its place. which is a great show but not what i paid for.
3,Slow story line,Found the story line slow and not as fast pace as I like for this writer. Through the title grabbed me.
4,Good Altogether,"At first, I, too, had some difficulty with this book. Meredith was a little...too prim and superficial in the beginning. However, I hated the treatment she received for one simple mismatch which was in no part her fault whatsoever, so I felt sympathy for her trying to be so smart and perfect for Society.I loved Philip, I thought he was adorably nerdy and cute. He was very sweet and honest, and non-judgmental. The book does pick up, if you keep going. It seems boring for a short while, but it really builds the character development."
2,Not up to her usual standars,"This book is not as good as D'Alessandro's books usually are. It lacked her trademark humor, and the heroes didn't have much chemistry. I finished t, but I can't say I remember anything special about it... I'm glad I borrowed it from a library, because I certainly won't be reading it again."
4,"Amusing, Fast-Paced Book","Jacquie D'Alessandro is quickly becoming a ""must have"" author. Her stories are always amusing, loving, and fast paced. In ""WHO WILL TAKE THIS MAN?"" we encounter a matchmaker, Meredith, who has been hired by the father of our hero, Philip, to find him a wife. After finding him the ""perfect"" match, Meredith discovers that there is a mysterious curse shadowing our hero. This curse will kill his intended bride two days after they wed. After informing his fiance of the pending doom, the wedding is called off.Meredith, afraid that this scandal will end her career, sets off to find Philip another bride. However, she soon discovers that she falls in love with him herself. Philip, a historian who would rather travel the world than run his estates, also finds himself drawn to Meredith. However, he will not marry her until he has discovered how to end the curse.Filled with humor, this book reads quickly. Highly recommended."
3,Could be better,"This book reminded me too much of the authors other book ""sleepless at midnight"". Just a bit too boring for me."
5,Wonderful Resource for Music Teachers,This CD is perfect for teaching rhythm. I have used it with grades 2 through 5 in identifying rhythms. They are able to layer in ostinato patterns along with the instruments playing on the CD. The students also are able to choreograph movement to go with the selections on the CD. This is a perfect resource for any music teacher.
5,Rhythm-it really does work!,"Experience the mesmerizing, therapeutic, and soothing power of rhythmic patterns on Spirit of the Drum. This CD is a collection of 9 distinctively different musical tapestries, each skillfully woven by master percussionist Arvin Scott. You'll hear a delightfully wide variety of percussive sounds as this CD opens up your door to the world of rhythm."
4,"Women's Rash Guard Shirt Great, But...","The women's rash guard shirt I ordered is a great product, and delivered sun protection as promised. However, the size guide given in the description is somewhat misleading. I will give the maker credit for advising customers to order a size up for looser fit, or two sizes up for a ""t shirt fit."" I am an size 4-6, and I usually wear a small in all t shirts. So I ordered a large, thinking I would get a loose, t shirt type fit. The shirt is tight, and a medium would have been unwearable. I should have ordered an extra large. This was very disappointing to me, as I tried to follow the guidelines. I would warn potential customers that these shirts are tight!"
3,A new perspective,"This was an interesting book from the standpoint of Cooper tends to propose theories based on his experience as an occultist rather than from a scholars approach. This is a fresh approach and I believe offers some insight into the nature of the religion. However, Cooper was quick to attack modern scholarship on several points and then turns around a builds theories of Mithras worship based on his own subjective views of occultism. I think it would've been more prudent of Cooper to compare the mystery religions of the day to Mithras rather than modern occult groups like the Golden Dawn and Free Masons - something that he critisizes scholars of doing with Mithras and Christianity. Over-all the book is a good introduction to Mithras - for occultists."
5,Why the Bible?,"The Bible is the most important book ever published. On the same note, it is also the most controversial, the most revered, and the most hated book ever published.The author does not take a position either way, but presents the Bible as the most central book to influence the history of Western Civilization, or civilization as a whole, for that matter.Important point that the author makes: if you go up to anybody, be it a total stranger, your mother, your best friend, anyone, and strike up a conversation about the Bible...just watch them. Their whole demeanor will change.That is the power that this-the most important of all books that man possesses-has over mankind.""The Book"" includes dozens of beautifully rendered photographs of Bibles that have been produced over the past 1500+ years."
2,Legal Reference Guide,"This book could be useful to the right reader. The emphasis is legal/trademark. It's a mini-text heavy on tradmark basics, definitions and court decisions. Franklin provides guidance on topics like trademark process and the differences between a copyright, trademark, etc.. Ir addresses the legal aspects of how to keep your trademark from becoming a generic word as was the fate of Xerox (we all should have such problems.) The book would probably be a good intro/reference for law students or paralegals but as a marketing mgr for a small company it wasn't what I was looking for."
4,How I grew Organic okra,"I tried to grow this, but the weather was too hot with no rain. I am from Penna. and never grew up with okra. I work with an Oklahoman who loved this. He saidyou have never had anything like fried okra. I hope this year I will."
2,Not much to go on,This is indeed not your typical travel book. Poorly organized and very selective in terms of landmarks and points of interest. I was very frustrated by it.
4,Thrilling and full of Suspense,Truly the worst evil imaginable---the evil in the heart of a child. The book reveals two faces of human nature --- one good and one evil. It is a true suspense with good dialogue. The plot is excellent but something was lacking which is why I did not feel it just to give a five star rating. R.L. Stine manages to continue spinning yarns about the Fear family and its curse leaving us impatiently waiting for the next story. The book is worth reading. Learn about the evil hidden within the depths of the Malbourne Estate...
5,One of the best in the Sagas!,"This book was really great. It was one of the best of his sagas and I could not put it down. R.L Stine puts so much work into his books. He adds horror, love and suspence into the books he writes. And these books, in my opinion, leave you reading and reading...."
5,It Rocks,"This book is about a young boy called Timothy who tells his friends a ghost story. A girl has been accused of her fathers murder and escapes from prison the day of her hanging. She is taken as a goveness for a family with two boys. The mother had died a long time ago. One of the boys is evil, one is not. All is not what it seems. The girl must survive this family. One question sticks in her mind. Where is the father? And what happend to the other goveneses?Vikki Carr wrote this review!!"
5,Passion and music,"I went to the launch of this book recently, which was a performance by both the author Carol Ann Duffy and Eliana Tomkins, the composer and singer. It was one of the most exciting literary events I have ever attended. The words spoken by Duffy were powerful and beautiful, but the added pleasure of hearing the poems so beautifully captured in song was a moving experience I would like to repeat, at which the audience wept, amazed. The songs are fabulous; easy to listen to but also full of gorgeous surprises; Ms Tomkins' voice is a creamy, erotic wonder. Do not miss the book nor the cd, which is on the JAZZ7 label."
5,Good to go,"Happy with the raiser so far. I have had no issues with it. Might have been happier with it, if it had an extra inch of height though. *laugh*"
5,Bicycle Stem Raiser,"Well, with the Delta Stem you will be getting exactly what you see in the picture. It will allow you to raise the handle bars anywhere from 1 to 3 inches. The part is very strong and makes a Big Difference as you ride. Your back will thank you!The only problem is this part comes with a black top cover. Not like the chrome one in the picture. This is no Big Deal."
4,Really improves comfort of riding,"This device is definitely something I've been needing for a while. I installed it on my mountain bike several weeks ago, and it has transformed the comfort. I no longer have to lean so far forward to ride (I'm an old dude, and really like a more upright posture).It installed easily, the only downside is that you really have to put some muscle into tightening the Allen screws to keep it from turning on the shaft. I recommended this to a friend, and that was his comment also. He didn't discover this until he went out riding with it the first time.A good gadget, four stars!"
4,works well,"The stem raised the handlebar level with the seat so the bike is MUCH more comfortable to ride now. It was easy to install, but it helps to have long hex keys."
4,Works well on my Giant Iguana,"I am 6' 2"" and wanted to sit more upright on my Giant Iguana which I use for mainly street and light trails. This gave me a few extra inches of elevation and really improved the feel of the bike. I wish it had come with some of those round spacers but otherwise it works nicely and has a strong fit."
1,excellent,Shipping was excellent and the discription of the item was right on the money. The piece was exactly as described. I will buy from seller again if they have something I need.
5,"Great part, great price","Recently took up biking again at age 47, as an effort to improve my cardio above what walking was doing for me. Decided to convert an MTB bike over to an urban assault vehicle, for working out 90% on the streets, 10% trails.Only problem is I didn't like being crouched over quite so far, and this little part takes care of that problem just perfectly.Raises the bars so the bike is more like a BMX bike feel, and is very high quality. It fit like a glove, I can't think of anything I'd improve. Great product."
4,Stem Raiser IS GREAT!,"I bought this stem raiser to adjust the height of my handlebars and it did the trick. I am more comfortbanle riding my bike without hunching over. This product was easy to install with a couple alan wrenches. I installed mine on my Schwinn mtb with only one hang up. I had to purchase an additional WASHER to make the stem raiser fit properly. It works great, but I had almost an 1/8"" gap under raiser after fastening it down as tight as it would go. The additional washer costs me $1 which is a bargain. I've riden bike several times and stem raiser has performed well."
3,needs some modification,The raiser does not have a deep enough throat to make a bolt-on fix on my bike... required an extra shim between the bearing shim and the raiser.. not a big deal if you have a shim or can make one.
3,Caution,"This appeared to be a good product and I'm sure it is for the right bike. The thing is it was a fraction to large for mine and as a result I could not secure it to the post, no matter how hard I tightened the bolts. Use caution when ordering by making sure it fits your bike exactly. When I measured the post it appeared to be 1 1/8"" as I ordered but maybe my bike is metric or something. Bottom line, I could not use it."
5,"Delta Alloy Bicycle Stem Raiser (Black, 1 1/8-Inch)",I needed the handle bars on my mountain bike to a bit higher. I was putting too much weight on my hands while riding and my hands would get numb. Now I don't lean so far forward and my rides are much more comfortable. I ride for pleasure with the added benefit of exercise.
2,An alternative,"I purchased this item only to find a similar item at Target for half the price. They called it a ""storage chest"" and not a toy box though. Needless to say I returned this one and bought the one at Target. There are differences in the two however. The item I bought is maple and not primary colors, so I will need to paint it if I decide to spice it up a bit, but for half the price, it is much more of a value if you are on a budget. =)"
2,Not a great experience,"At first glance, a cute toy box. Assembly was easy until I tried to install the safety hinge. The hinge barely moved and when I tried to close the lid, it completely broke off of the box. Also, the red is not as bright as it appears in the picture... it is more like a Coral color. Now after waiting for the product to be shipped and assembing... I have to dis-assemble and return the product. A hassle I didn't want in my 9th month."
3,Think about quality,"I had a cassette tape of this 20 years ago. After a long time has passed, I missed the soothing sound. I bought my copy of the CD used but it was advertised as ""outstanding condition"". The process of buying thru Amazon was incredibly efficient and very timely. Unfortunately, the CD arrived with deep scratches in it which do cause a skip or hesitation in the sound, making it difficult to meditate with. Looking into buying a ""CD repair/refurbish"" device just for such occasions.Amazon was great, supplier not so up-and-up."
2,Ommmm....zzzzzz,"I found this CD rather boring and repetitive. I suppose that is what you want to listen to while meditating (or perhaps sleeping), but to hear the same thing over and over again drove me up the wall. I should have read these reviews before purchasing. If I realized this was just one track with the same thing on it, I would have passed."
5,Background music for your soul,This could be the background soundtrack for my life and I would live in a constant state of ecstacy. I just keep playing it over and over and it keeps me feeling calm and deeply connected.A MUST for anyone who loves spiritual musicMary Anne Erickson
2,"Not bad, but there's a better one out there","This ""Cynnic's Dictionary"" is pretty good, but it's not a patch another book which shares its' same name, ""The Cynic's Dictionary"" by Rick Bayan (Quill, 1994), which is nothing less than brilliant."
3,It's not a fun game if you don't have the cheat codes,Too bad I couldn't get to the first mission because the parking lot was so dark I couldn't see where I was going. So I just raced around and entered cheat codes to outrace the police. I was dissappointed also about the game and how much it was publicized to be the best. I found that more companies make demo software to make the game look better than it really is. I hope I can write a better review some day stating that a game is really great.
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"I am a big fan of the author. But this is the worst book ever.... If you like to waste money and time, buy it. I really don't understand how people can rate it so high..."
3,A Pleasant Diversion,"Granted, not the mightiest of the EM albums, butnevertheless a pleasant diversion. I enjoy listeningto a deep voice read poetry with piano, such asthe wonderful Kerouac collection. This albumis similar in spirit; sparse production, but lushin the listening. My only complaint is thatsometimes the levels of the piano and voiceare struggling against one another fordominance. More often than not, thevocals lose, which is unfortunate, asthey are the centerpiece of the work."
4,"Old, but useful","This book published in 1994 is somewhat outdated, but still contains very useful information for the Buddhist pilgrim planning a trip to India.[...]"
4,Who Slew Auntie Roo? Horror and Macabre Humor,"Who Slew Auntie Roo? is a story loosely based on the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. Aunt Roo (Shelley Winters) is an eccentric, middle aged lady, who lost her young daughter several years ago in a tragic fall, and has been trying to contact her through a medium (Sir Ralph Richardson) ever since. When a group of orphans, including Christopher Coombs (Mark Lester) and his sister Katy (Chloe Franks), visit Aunt Roo's mansion for a Christmas party, Aunt Roo becomes convinced that Katy is her daughter returned to life, and kidnaps her, locking her in a secret room. What follows is their attempts to to escape. Christopher is convinced that she's going to cook and eat them. Entertaining and suspenseful, Who Slew Aunt Roo is very interesting and enjoyable."
3,Good Old Days,This is a movie i watched as a kid (many years ago) with fascination. Is now very dated but is a curio of a movie just to see some of the old greats do there stuff.Harpo Marx as usual magic to watch!!!! Raises a few questions of the human condition circa 1957. If you think about nothing is much better these days
1,All-Star Disaster,"Producer-director Irwin Allen's answer to ""Around the World in 80 Days"" was this painfully bad 1957 adaptation of the Hendrik Willem van Loon book. Plenty of talent - and stock footage - goes to waste in ""The Story of Mankind."" Only Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Harpo Marx (as Sir Isaac Newton), Groucho Marx (as Peter Minuit) and Peter Lorre (as Nero) manage to avoid total embarrassment. Allen's first disaster movie in every sense of the word. Sadly, the final screen appearances of Colman, Harpo and Chico Marx."
4,Nice Birdee House,"Bought it as a gift for my parents cabin. Attracts birds every summer, which also attracts the foxes. No deaths to report. Good quality bird house."
2,Not practical for an actual birdhouse,"I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. I bought it to actually use as a birdhouse but I honestly can't see a bird fitting down the shaft and building a nest inside. The shaft is about 5"" high, 3"" wide and only 1"" deep. I just don't see a bird being able to fit in there to build a nest and fly back out. I will most likely save it as an ""indoor decoration"" gift for someone. At least it wasn't expensive."
4,Great reading! Held my attention.,"Well written murder mystery book. Being from the Pittsburgh area, the book setting peaked my interest. Recommended reading. Looking forward to his next book."
3,"Great Premise, a bit too long","I love a good puzzle and this novel certainly supplied it. On the downside, it could have been much shorter than its 400 pages and the constant point of view changes as the author jumped from character to character in the same scene is amateurish. Being a magic hobbyist I found Tucker's scenes that involved magic to be highly acurate. The author's depiction of Pittsburgh is right on the money. Felt like I lived there (Hey, I do!). I recently bought ""Hocus Corpus,"" Tucker's second Dr. Merlin book. Haven't started it yet, but hope the author corraled those POV changes."
1,Great title. Nice font.,"Summary: A high-premise book, nicely packaged, with writing that simply does not deliver.The characters are neither believable nor sympathetic, the dialogue is strained, the narrative difficult to visualize, the motivations often vague. Although the author has some interesting ideas, the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. Readers whose expectations begin and end with a fairly credible ""puzzle story"" might find this book appealing, but I would not recommend it to anyone who seeks engaging characters and well-crafted prose."
1,Trudged through this one,"I can only hope James Tucker is a better doctor than writer. One reviewer said that the characters were disjointed. I agree 100%. Tucker spends SO much time trying to develop characters that he ends up creating a confusing atmosphere. Over halfway through the book I looked at the back cover again, and was SURPRISED to find out that Jack Merlin is considered the leading character. Could have fooled me. I thought of him as a side story, allowing the Assistant DA access into the medical world.One Pittsburgher said that the book hits on the hot spots, and local quirks of PGH. I'm not so sure. I recently moved to PGH and feel like I know no more about the city than I did before I read the book. It's not like the John Sanford ""Prey"" series that make you feel like you're actually walking THROUGH Minneapolis.In summary, do yourself a favor: don't bother with this book. There are so many other stories that flow and put you at the scene."
2,Don't bother,"I depend on the customer reviews to buy a new author. Boy, was I bored until 2/3 of the book, then everything was so convoluted, I skipped to the Epiloge.(Something Ive never done.) I don't recommend you waste your money. The plot was very unbeliveable."
3,Not the most erasable,"These markers have a very attractive design, with a see-through barrel and consistent write quality. However, they don't seem to erase as well as other brands...the dried ink, when erased, leaves a greasy, smeary residue. Writing left on for a while is even more difficult to erase...requires several scrubbing wipes with the eraser.Shame, because I really like the clear barrel and chiseled writing tip."
2,Not as good as they used to be?,"A side by side test with an old, worn Quartet marker showed an obvious difference. My last Quartet marker was getting old, so with their new ""patented three chamber technology"" and ""ink level gauge,"" I thought these would show a marked (sorry) improvement over the old ones. Not so! Even my old Quartet markers are darker than these brand new ones. Quartet must have changed something, and not for the better. Very disappointing.Expo markers are much darker and the colors much bolder. They erase well too - just don't get Expo ""washable"" markers. They're about as faint as these and don't erase well at all.Good: Visible ink well, cap snaps on tightly, won't roll, erases wellBad: Much fainter ink than they used to have. Nearly unacceptable."
1,Leaky & Hard to erase,"Initially, I was impressed with the patented 3-chamber technology that would make the markers last longer and give the user a visual indication of when the ink has run out. Unfortunately, with about a week of use, the ink started leaking from the tip leaving puddles on my dry erase board and left stains on my fingers every time I attempt to write with it. And I'm not even a heavy user. The chamber which was full a week ago is nearly empty now. Also, I agree with another reviewer who said that it is difficult to erase the ink after it's dried. You need to put a good amount of elbow grease with the dry eraser. Perhaps I got a defective one, but I'm going to stick to the tried and true Expo markers from now on."
4,Works great!,These are the best markers I have ever found. My daughter loves it ! The best thing about these marker is the channel technology that controls flow of the ink and makes the life of markers longer.
4,Dry Erase Marker,These markers do not smell when you use them. There colors are vibrant and stand out on the white board when I use them in teaching.
1,Environmental Impact of Plastic Casings?,"I am writing to express my concern about the environmental impact of the plastic casings for Quartet dry erase markers. I use them in the classroom where I teach out of necessity. However, within two weeks they have run out of ink and it's time to open a new pack. Meanwhile these hard plastic casings for the ink are being dispensed of in the garbage and ending up, non biodegradable, in landfills. I have written the company to ask that they evaluate other ways of encasing these so as to lessen their environmental impact. Perhaps they might find away to create a refillable encasing - like a fountain pen. Offices or schools could have a dispenser where employees could refill their pens.I used a SMARTBoard where I previously taught and did not have to rely upon these dry erase markers."
2,I want my money back.,"I watched this trying to find a truly good, spooky horror movie. I was pretty disappointed here. For starters, it looks like it was filmed on someone's home video camera. A personal pet peeve. The acting was terrible. It does look like a student film, but not a good one. The general plot failed when the action started to happen and the kids didn't leave when they had ample opportunity and wrote in pathetic reasons for why they wouldn't. It wasn't just like your typical bad decision making from a teen scream movie, it was really bad writing. Bad sets, bad directing, awful special effects...I'll give it this, it did have one or two scenes with some mild creepiness. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time, and its only a 1hr 15m movie."
2,Not so good,"I'm all for suspense-building and some good creepy things happening but there's just not enough of this here. I found the first half pretty boring - mostly two characters sitting around being scared after a couple of things happen. On the plus-side, the female lead's fear is mostly believable but her hysteria just goes on way too long. Things finally get going and the story becomes a little more interesting but the overall effect is only so-so. I'll watch it once more, in case it improves the second time around (as many movies do), but something tells me this DVD will end up in my next box of donations to the Salvation Army. Good thing I got it from a clearance bin..."
2,Skip this one,"First I'd like to admit I stink at writing reviews. I know that however I wish to save you some time and money.I started watching this movie and simply couldn't stay focused due to the boring slow moving story. I stopped watching around 15 minutes in. I then started back up the next day as I paid for it and I was desperate to watch something. I made it to 45 minutes out of the 113 total and stopped again. It's slow moving, I don't care about the characters or have a need to find out what's going on. I suspect I'll try and finish it tomorrow, as I paid for it, but I suggest you skip this one unless you are really desperate to watch something. It's very very slow moving and the things that do happen are so far between with the filling being the characters just verbally stressing out over what happened. That would probably happen in real life but it doesn't make for good entertainment."
1,I cannot even tell you how bad,"I cannot even begin to tell you how bad it is for I just couldn't get into the story line, yes that bad. I couldn't even get through this movie to the end. The worst part is I love b movies and this well tells you it must be in the d or f sorry I normally leave better reviews but like I said couldn't even get through it."
2,Kind of Weak,An ancient haunting legend takes its toll on modern visitors to a rural wooded location. The actors spend too much time frozen in fear while a guy in overalls and a women with a big hole in her mouth reek havoc. The idea was OK but the execution is not so good.
1,Seriously bad movie,"I do not usually write reviews but this one was not just low budget, they must not have had a script either. It was just random shots that had nothing to do with each other. It could not have been any stupider if it tried!!"
1,Hysterical women,If you like to see movie cliques and hysterical women you might like this movie. It really has nothing at all going for it. I'm sorry I even watched it for free and would demand my money back if I paid to watch it.
1,Excessive Choir Noise and Coughing,"Excessive choir noise and coughing ruin this album. On one of the most important tracks, Tomás Luis de Victoria's Ave Maria, there is an extremely loud cough, louder than the singing, at about 1:30. The producer should have recorded a second take of any track which was thus ruined."
3,Don't Order the Extra Tie Downs!,"This product arrived swiftly and efficiently as per other Amazon transactions and looks like it will work out fine once the weather warms up. An annoying detail NOT MENTIONED in the description, however, is that the product INCLUDES the bow/stern tie-downs (Thule 855Thule 855 Quick Draw Boat Bow/Stern Tie Down Rachets) that are recommended with this rack. DO NOT buy the bow/stern tie-downs as an extra item (like I did) or else you will end up with two sets of them and may end up missing the 30-day return deadline and getting stuck with them (also like I did). Other than that, the rack has typical Thule construction and will perform it's duty well once installed and the rivers thaw out."
3,One Problem...,One problem...if the gunwales of the canoe are within a couple of inches of the the Thule feet securing the Thule load bars you won't be able to use the padded cradles included in this canoe roof rack mount carrier. You will have to wrap the Thule straps around the load bar. If that scenario occurs...you have paid eighty five dollars for two tie down straps and bow/stern straps because the padded craddles are useless.
4,very good kayak carrier,"I once lost a kayak from the car roof in strong wind conditions - very scary. happy to have the Thule carrier, which we use regularly on long distance drives - very sturdy, easy to use and secures the kayak easily on our Forester - no problems after using it for several months constantly. all in all a solid product."
3,what they dont tell you!,Thank goodness I went to REI to try this.....with a Thule base rack 450 foot and square bars.what I found is the 579xt canoe pads interfere with the tie downs 450s. or any tie downs for that matter.where ever your foot ties are your canoe pad installs either 4.5 inches outside of it or 2 inches inside of it......there's a blank spot where your footsie's are OR CANT REACH.This can be corrected by buying a longer bar and carry the canoe offset from your hoods center line.NOT FOR ME......I HAVE A ZILLION DOLLAR EXPERIMENTAL SOLAR CANOE STRIP MAHOGANY.MINES GOING TO BE CARRIED CENTER OR BUST WITH TIGHT CORDS FT/BK.......IF THE OFFSET PADS SLIP THEN YOU HAVE 1 FOOT OF CORD FREE PLAY (THEN SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR CANOE AT 70MPH. NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE don't let the factory talk you into offset carry.TALK TO THE HAND.
1,Beware of Resellers (Comes in a Ziplock Bag),"I would rate this product 5 stars except I did not get what was promised.The reason for the low price is that you're not exactly buying a 3 pack. You're buying 3 tongue scrapers in a Zip Lock bag. So the ""color coded"" feature is entirely false. I shopped around and found several other websites admitting that you are buying a bulk pack (i.e. you're not getting this nicely packaged as shown in this photo). However, that's not what the Amazon resellers (such as reseller TeethNThings) are selling you here.So if you can live with that, you're getting a good product. I feel deceived. This is a HYGIENE PRODUCT after all. I have NO IDEA if the person who placed my tongue scrappers in the bag even washed his or her hands."
5,Best tongue scraper ever found.,"I have scoured different stores for an effective tongue scraper, which everyone should use on a daily basis for their health. I had resorted to buying the usual mediocre scraper from a Walgreen's, which does not work well. I highly recommend this tongue scraper to anyone interested in better oral hygiene and fresher breath."
2,"Only one white one, two blue ones :-/",I don't think it was in the product description that you only get ONE white one and TWO blue ones (the blue are 'softer'). I swear I used to get three white ones. Not cool.
2,Average,"Big pro: very easy to carry in your pocket, but as a tongue cleaner, it's not really the best product. The scooper is way to sharp, and if you're not careful it can cut your tongue. It resembles more of a knife than a tongue cleaner."
5,Great Product,"Has as normal and soft edge. Works Great, highly recommend. Didn't have to deal with shipper so can't comment on service. It arrived within the time promised."
5,Accurate display of history -- excellently filmed,"So much is made about WWII well after it started -- this is the only film to spend time on the harrowing escape of British soldiers from the coast of France before the Germans snapped them up! If not for the escape from Dunkirk, Britain would have probably been forced to lose or capitulate to Germany, one way or another. An excellent prelude to watching the Battle of Britain, too!"
4,Close To Home,"I love watching this film for many reasons, it's well acted and very realistic. I think it gives a very real portrayal of the situation that 300,000+ British soldiers found themselves in in 1940, and I have to admit I watch it with a slight lump in the throat every time as I think of the fact that my Grandfather was actually on that beach, waiting for his turn to be evacuated. It's inspirational to see all those civilians in their tiny pleasure boats crossing the channel time and time again to rescue them.The Battle of Britain may have been our ""finest hour"", but the heroic efforts to bring the boys back home has to come pretty damn close as well."
1,Yesterday's News,"I was once a tamagotchi crazed individual in their first entrance to the toy market, and i admit, i still like playing with my tamagotchi now and then, but really, another tamagotchi? Bandai, or mattel, needs to reasses their marketing strategy. They do not understand much about the needs of their markets, if they did, they would realise that this toy is not wanted anymore. This product could be seen as a lame excuse to bring back the craze, but really it is the mindless people at bandai, wanting more money and publicity. There are no words that can describe why this toy is not as popular as it used to. It is just that thing that makes a product 'wanted', and it no longer exists in this product, as with digimon, and pokemon. They are just 'has beens'. I would rather see some other electronic, orginal toy being produced, rather than revamped versions of the old ones."
1,stopped working,Got it at Christmas and it stopped working already only after a couple weeks. It went dead. I tried the reset button and even replaced the battery and it still doesn't work. Can't find the receipt to replace it and TOYSRUS doesn't have anymore!!!! I am very dissappointed. I want a working Tamagachi Connection toy or my money back!
2,What else can you do?,"Whats the point of this toy? It has such bad graphics come on it is the 21centurie compare taht to Final Fantasie. It cuod at least have color , ditaiels you now.You can not even buy stuff for it or have a little house for the Tamagochi."
2,"sometimes fun, but often annoying","This toy is fun, especially when kids can play with other kids who have them. But 3 weeks after Christmas they've already been banned from school as distractions (with good reason), so they sit on the kids' desks at home and bleep at an empty room all day. Then if no one remembers them, they wake up the kids at night with their chirping. The premise is good, but there should be a better a way to turn them off (rather than just ""pause"" them) so they're not constantly interrupting school, homework, meals and sleep."
1,we need more!!!,"well, you should have MANY more items, because I keep on looking, but they are always out of stock! I put one for everything because I can't get one!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is a great show. I've always had a thing for the Robin Hood story and this is my favorite adaptation of the legend. The price is great as well, so it's a win-win situation!"
2,Should've stopped at season one,"I loved season one of this show and even bought the DVD set for that series. I began TIVOing the episodes this season and stopped watching after it became so ridiculous. While the first season had some irritating things (Gisbon, Robin and Marian wearing designer clothes; the perfect hair; Marian's Nightwatchman persona; and replacing Friar Tuck with a female Muslim character), I did enjoy it as a fun swashbuckling series. This year with the supernatural plotlines and the Black Knights, it became more on the par with Xena. They ruined an entertaining series this year."
2,Robin Hood - Season 2,Delivery time was OK but one of the CDs is not watchable and others are falling off the box. I am dissapointed with the quality of the packaging and defective CD.
1,They ruined the whole series.,"I will not tell you how Season Two ended; but I was totally disappointed in the ending of Season Two. Actually, I was mad at the ending. I really enjoyed Season One. I am enjoyed the Season Two up to the ending but they ruined the whole show. I have no intested in watching Season Three."
1,"Good show, crummy discs and package","The discs fall right out of the package and the last two episodes malfuntioned repeatedly. You would think that for $50 you could get a package that works. Crooks.Marion dies - big whoop. I didn't like her much anyway. And as for, Jack (sp?) - good riddance. Welcome back Alan."
5,Awesome,"""Totally awesome"", says my nine-year old son ""but a little less blood next time"". He has enjoyed this series a lot."
5,fun series,This show is a fun series. Story line ok. Actors fairly good. Will watch next season. Good show to watch to relax and forget the rest of the day.
3,Too much disappointment...,"OH, how I enjoyed this series. I watched the first season over and over and was looking forward to the second. Then with the finale, I felt the same as another reviewer. Didn't want to watch it anymore. Too much of a downer. I watch fantasy for the feeling that things might have a happy ending. Well done series though. Beautiful scenery. Fun characters that you love to hate. Just can't get past the tragedy."
5,Amazing!,This is the Robin Hood of our generation! The characters are easy to identify with and you really grow to love them. It is a great show and you have to get it on DVD so you can watch it over and over agian.
2,A good show ruined.,"After buying Robin Hood season one on impulse, my wife and I became addicted to the show. We watched season one in a week, then went back to the store and bought season two. We LOVED the show until the last episode of season two, which, for us, ruined everything that had come before it. We will not be buying season three, and we will not watch ANY of the episodes again."
4,Things are getting more serious for the second season,"""Robin Hood Season One"" was an instant hit in our household. We bought the DVD as soon as the pre-order became available and had a marathon watch before Season 2 premiered. Both my spouse and I loved the campy, fantasy type humor of the series.Season Two is much more serious. Both Robin and the Sheriff are playing for keeps now and there's no taboo now on Robin taking lives.We're pre-ordering Season Two, but the episodes have not held us as bedazzled as the first season. Still, this is a show I know we'll dust off and watch in the future on a snowy weekend or during summer reruns.Rebecca Kyle, July 2008"
4,Beautiful and somewhat disturbing.,"Belinda was one of those books that I picked up on a whim, and I am glad that I did. Pedophilia isn't something I condone, mind you, but it does make for an interesting read. The characters are a bit underdeveloped for my taste, and I didn't much care for the blase attitude of Belinda herself. However, that is an integral part of why this book was hard to put down. As an Anne Rice fan, this book strikes me as an odd duck when looking into the rest of her novels, but it does somehow round out the collection. Not the most highly recommended, but still engaging enough to rate 4 stars."
2,I was disappointed!,The beggining of the book was un-put-downable for a bit until the issue 'mystery' of this Belinda cropped up and all the hype/trite/clicheness about her being a child superstar flooded the book. I also didn't like all the 80s version of being a film star and all that. It reminded me vaguely of 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' and everything 80s. A fairly good read if you skip more than half the book (which unfolds who Belinda is). The wait was EXHAUSTING.
5,Belinda is amazing..,"I loved this book. I myself am 16 and I'd never have a relationship with someone who was that much older than me but to read about it kinda fills in that blank. It's a fantasy come true in this story. At times I hated Belinda and at other times i loved her, and all of her friends/family were equally real. Just because there was no real hard core sex in it dosn't mean it's not erotic! I found it very sexy without having to have TOO MANY details. I think many people would love this book if they gave it a chance. And also, why, if you hate the story, whould you want to read all 500 pages of it? i'd give up if i disliked it THAT much..."
2,i couldnt *force* myself to finish this one,"ive never read anne rice before and i will never read her again. how belinda (a child) is able to hold the attention of jeremy (an adult?) is just beyond me. i forced myself to pick this book up, never being one to start something and not finish it, but i finally decided this one wasnt worth my time!"
3,Overall a good read,"When I first bought Belinda, I was excited becase I had just finished Cry to Heaven, which I had absolutely fallen in love with. Nevertheless, I was really disappointed in the beginning of Belinda. It was really slow and had too many details. But as it drew to a close, that's when I couldn't put it down. The last half of the book was heart-clenching - it's just too bad the beginning didn't start out the same! Although I definitely recommend reading it."
1,Awful!,"My review of this book consists of the following adjectives: boring, mundane, tedious, stupid, pathetic. Worse - the protagonist is a self-pitying idiot! It was a complete waste of money!"
1,Really bad...,"""Lolita a la lousy, December 30, 1999"" by ""A Customer"" says it all. This was the most boring book I have ever read. The only reason I read the whole thing is because a friend insisted...but it took me EIGHT MONTHS to slog through."
1,Thought it was a peice of junk,"Thought it was a peice of junk, Thought it was a peice of junk, Thought it was a peice of junk"
2,Couldnt get into it,"I guess it's because I'm a guy....but the idea of a 44 year old childrens book author falling for a 16 year old girl was rather creepy for me. Why would a world renouned author turn into a pedophile?if you're a woman, I'm sure you'll like it"
4,Semi-Modern Lolita,"This book has been harshly reviewed but I did not find it that awful. Yes, it is a bit of a ""Lolita"" rip-off but Rice adds enough of her own personal touches to this novel to further itself from ""Lolita"". Some of the differences include the portrayl of the characters. For example, Belinda is a street smart girl who really does love Jeremy unlike Lolita who seemed to be more infatuated with Humbert rather than really love him. Jeremy, on the other hand, is very similar to Humbert simply because he is totally in love with Belinda. While I did not fully appreciate Holy Communion made into erotica, I thought it was an engrossing book. If you are looking for something quick to read, this is a good choice. Not every work of literature/fiction can be deeply meaningful or serious; some fluff every once in awhile is refreshing. Also, if you are looking for erotica, this is a good bet. Especially the scene involving red wine towards the beginning of the book."
2,Totally boring and not even mildly erotic,"I thought this book would be stimulating, instead I found myself putting it down and trying to figure out 'where are the good parts'. This is the first book I have ever started that I can't seem to finish. I think the relationship between Jeremy and Belinda is hardly realistic. It seems the only thing thay have is common is sex and this aspect was not explored in sufficient detail to make the book 'erotic reading material'."
3,Beginning,"It is a nice story, quite related to Nabokov's Lolita. This is not the Gothic Anne Rice"" but it is very well written."
3,Not as good as the Sleeping Beauty novels...,"I was hoping that Anne Rice's Belinda would have the same tantalizing and thought-provoking brand of erotica as the Sleeping Beauty series. However, I found this novel lacking in both depth and eroticism. The story of a forty-four-year-old artist and his obsession with a sensual sixteen-year-old runaway who moves into his home falls flat in various places. There are plenty of S&M and mind-control scenes here, but they leave a lot to be desired -- so to speak. Anne Rice isn't known for intellectually stimulating literature, but her erotic novels have been quite memorable -- save for Belinda."
1,GARBAGE,"This book was so stupid that I kept reading hoping that it would turn around. More than half way through the book I realized that was not going to happen. When I typed in that I wanted to read an erotica book, ""Belinda"" popped up. Although there were a few negative reviews I still bought it. What a mistake! The book has no eroticism in it. The love scenes were very underdeveloped and boring. I felt like I was reading a book written by a nun! The book borders on child pornography because I just could not get over a 40-something year-old man who was so enamoured with a 16-year-old girl who in the beginning of their relationship he insisted on her dressing in very innocent and childish type nightgowns so he could paint her and then make love to her. Please don't waste your money. Listen to the negative reviews. Those who gave it positive reviews...I think they may be referring to another book with the same title."
4,"Good read, but not memorable","BELINDA is a well-written novel by an author who has produced even better works. I give it four stars because it's absorbing enough while you're reading it, and you can tell Anne Rice had talent even when she was writing as Anne Rampling. But I can't say this book is one of my favorites. I just felt like I didn't get as close to the main characters as I could have. They're not the least bit immortal as Lestat is, so to speak.But if you're a voracious reader, go ahead and pick this one up. There's nothing to lose."
3,FUn but Anne can't help being Anne.,I always judge erotica by other criteria than other books. How horny do I get when I read it? Unfortunately this book did nothing for me. The memoirs of a man trying to get jailbait had really nothing more erotic than a rejected Harlequin Romance. Yet the romance angle makes it a fun book with a rather devious plotline. Sadly the whole Hollywood thing makes me gag in memories of thousands of gossip shows with Downtown Julie Brown and no one does any movies in this book which aren't incredibly arty but incredibly awful Eurotrash movies. Very fun
1,I don't get it...,"Based on the majority of the glowing reviews on this book I decided to buy it. The visual imagery produced in my mind's eye by the writing was incredible, but I don't feel that this book was all that. Somehow I felt everyone is just raving about it because the author is Anne Rice. Jeremy and Belinda's relationship is just plain weird, I can't understand how a love like Jeremy's and Belinda's can develop given their differences, first starting on age, background as well as the things Jeremy did to/for Belinda. What is the attraction for both of them here?? Why someone as independent and strong in character as Belinda would go back to Jeremy after what he did to her in New Orleans is beyond me. The ending was a total letdown from the way it started."
2,Not very good,"Although promising of explicit kinky sex with underage teen beauties, this proved to be more of a story on the politics of hollywood - with very little underage sex, and even less kink. The main character is a perv, and it's the little girl aspect of Belinda that appeals to him, not really anything about HER as a person, or individual.Worth a few laughs, but otherwise just several hundred pages of letdown."
4,"A Modern ""Lolita"" Tale","This is one of the lesser-lesser known works by the authoress Anne Rice, written under her least common pen name. On the surface, Belinda seems to resemble Nabakov's famous work Lolita, but the character dimension has Rice's typical sparkle, the intimate scenes are more vivid and realistic, and the more modern setting makes it more accessible for many.This book is a shade more controversial and patently sexual than most of the Vampire Chronicles, but less so than the Beauty Trilogy, so if you are coming from either series, don't expect the same style."
5,"An Erotic Distrubing Novel , not for the closed minded.","I personally loved this book. I thought it was well written, the characters came alive and seemed so real. What can I say Anne Rice definately knows how to spell bind her readers. She did it again with this book. Making even a disturbing issue sexy and erotic. You can't help but love the main character, even though he's supposed to be viewed as a villan in societies eyes, you can't help but root for him. I love this book. I've read it about five times. Every single time I re-read it I love it even more."
5,You will not want to put it down...ever,"Although I found Exit to Eden a more graphic form of erotica, this one leaves you just as breathless. At times it made me feel guilty for letting it excite me, but then I found myself helpless to their desire. If you are a fan of forbidden love, this book is a must for you..."
1,This watch will break,"I bought this watch in various designs for my son and one for my daughter. Every watch broke within 6-12 months of purchase. My daughter's watch broke in the first 6 hours of wearing it and we were at the museum that day so she wasn't doing anything that might cause it to break. When I went to the jewelry store to have it repaired, I was told that they had seen a bunch of watches of this style all mysteriously breaking. It is hard to find a digital watch for kids that isn't made of plastic or very plain. These watches are cute and easy to use but they will break every time. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this."
5,"Excellent Book, As Ever","I do love Hitchens, and I'm quite fond of his tone. I wholeheartedly recommend his work. While he's not entirely convincing on the ""War"" issue(I think his abstracting of a ""theocratic fascist"" enemy is a bit problematic), otherwise he's always tight and if nothing else, fun to read. He's a bit tedious in the last Orwell book, but his essays have no remotely blunt areas--i.e., very sharp-like, all the time.As to the Dalai Llama issue raised at length below...let's see, ""he has no right to denigrate our religion."" No. No, that's objectively wrong. He has every right to denigrate your religion. Of course there's so many moral cowards running around right now, I can see why you'd think that. Nobody's ever bothered to denigrate your religion before. One would think there were a law against it, or something. Of course if you substitute the ""religious"" in ""anti-religious bias"" with ""nonsense,"" as in ""anti-nonsense bias,"" Hitchens' position may be more comprehensible."
2,Hitch not up to par in this one.,"Hitchens can be a very sharp, insightful writer. A good mind well-stocked with infomation, history, and taste. This book, however, seems to have been thrown or pasted together as a piece of pulp writng, not up to his often very high standards of erudition and wit. Try reading his ""Why Orwell Matters"" for a glimpse of the real Hitch."
3,What is he thinking?,"I've always been smitten by hitchen's wit...it's like vico but with a lot of ethnocentric views. He's original in his writings but convey his philosophy in a purely orwellian fashion. I disagree with some of his views on muslim (or jihadist, binladenist, wahabbist, extremist, etc) and as a commentary/academic he owes much time in learning more about other's culture before sacking them with fundamental genaralisation.The war on iraq has been his infamous support and this might be the cause of his present commentary. I just doubt ""truth"" as he claims he knows is just but a mere certainty looked upon with a present and comfortable view without the stark reality."
3,Just OK,"Not nearly as good as ""Plumbing a House"", but probably due to the fact that there are just to many different ways to finish a bathroom. Some good concepts in here but not a whole lot that you couldn't get off the intertubewebz. Other thoughts: good reading while you are in the bathroom..."
4,Great book,Information in this book was a great help and saved me a lot of money building the tile shower I just finished.
5,"Delicious! Literary gossip with spirit, wit and insight","I just loved this book. The miracle that David Laskin has performed is managing so much biographical information on so many diverse and original characters, and making them live so vividly as individuals.How could it be that these women -- Hardwick, McCarthy, Arndt, Jean Stafford --- could have such first rate minds yet be so dismissive of feminism? What a wonderful, complex intellectual-historical question and what a good job Laskin does of answering it. They were all, of course, male identified, to use the modern parlance and it was this that liberated them to act as men and to write in the muscular way of men, and this was probably necessary to free them of the chains of their cultural ""femininity."" Thanks for this wonderful book, which feels perfectly necessary to the understanding of how we've got where we are today."
2,"Nudge, Nudge, Wink, Wink: David Laskin Among the Intellos","David Laskin's journalistic and scatter-shot approach to this group of significant American intellectuals is disappointing. The emphasis is on anecdotes rather than motives, psychology, ideas, or works created. The book is lightly documented, and if you already know anything about the individual writers or the movements they were part of, you'll look in vain for new insights. It's certainly readable, but because it treats the subjects with so little context, the reader wonders after a bit why one should care about these folk, who sound more like a bunch of dysfunctional celebrities of the nineties than the defining minds of a complex and fascinating historical era."
1,Don't waste your time,I was keen on using the MyPod with our new Senseo but was disappointed from the start. I filled the MyPod (1 1/2 spoons) with our best coffee ground to the same consistency as the Senseo coffee pods and all that we got was essentially brown water. No nice froth or taste.Don't waste your time or money.
5,Favorite Coffee for you senseo,"I really hate the senseo coffee, but like the convenience. This little device is easy to use and makes good coffee. Just get the right grind for how strong you need it. worth the price."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"A great idea... unfortunately for me the result was a great let down. The songs are cheesy, repetative and a little too synthetic, I could more easily listen to Hi-5.The first time round was a little fun to listen to... I am not sure I could do it again though."
5,Fun and motivational,I purchased the CD after hearing a sample. I'm glad I made the purchase....the songs are really motivating and stick in your head.
4,great,"Great book....I didn't finish yet, but I will be working on it for a long time, cause is part of my research project."
4,Distinctive folders,"The colors are very vibrant, and that's why I chose this product. They feel a little less sturdy than other brands I have used, but they do the job."
2,not true to color shown,"I chose the Jewel tones Smead Folders, because I liked the colors that they were supposed to be; as displayed on the amazon website. Unfortunately, the folders that arrived were not at all the same colors displayed on the internet. They are very different and not at all pleasing to look at. What a disappointment."
4,fine,These folders are fine. I just wish office supplies weren't so darn expensive because it really adds up over time.
5,Flip Flop Review,Most people think that Yellow Box's are overpriced but you should realize that they are more expensive because they are great shoes. I have numerous pairs of yellow box's and they are durable and comfortable but still remain cute over time.
2,Yellow Box Mahalia Flip Flops,"I am not happy with these shoes at all. In fact I am sending them back. They actually look like seconds. It was hard for me to think Yellow Box would actually let these go out of their company. The fit is fine, but the beads are missing so bad especially on the left shoe. I have many Yellow Box sandles and have always been satisfied. This is the first time for me to order on line Yellow Box shoes.I have been planning the boots that I have been viewing, but I am going to think about it. I have been unable to find a retailer here in Cincy that sells them. Maybe you could give me that info. Do I have free postage on this return? I have ordered many items from Amazon & will continue to if this is made right by me. I love Amazon since I got my Kindle Fire back in January, they have made it easy for me to order. My husband hates for me to order on line, thinking it is unsafe. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to do this review.Sincerely, Donna Pacetti"
2,A Mostly Failed Attempt To Copy Baseball Mogul,"The cover of this box looks like you are buying the sequel Baseball Mogul -- a game originally published by WizardWorks over three years ago. Don't be fooled because this is an entirely different game. Baseball Mogul is an accurate baseball simulation with all the real players and very smart computer AI. By contrast, Season Ticket Baseball is a buggier version of the same concept.The HTML output is a nice feature if you want to run leagues but it too can be tricky to get it working right. And the engine for generating new minor leaguers each year clearly needs much more work. If you are really interested in league play you should visit baseballmogul.com and play head-to-head against other real human players.Its really nice to see people copying Baseball Mogul and since I don't know how to program I must say this is a good effort. But if you have a choice buy Baseball Mogul instead."
4,Game kicks (...)!,"The previous reviews say it all really, but it is nice to see a game that relies on depth and gameplay instead of graphics."
2,Not the Full Documentary Series,"The box set packaging of this release is its best feature. Alot of effort was spent repackaging and adding menus and extra features to this release. It adds nothing to the documentary first shown in 1951. There is a very annoying anti-piracy sequence on each of the five discs and way too many steps involved in getting to the actual episodes. Another reviewer mentioned that the discs won't play in his CD player. Two of the five discs won't play in my machine either. The original series was 24 episodes with the opening sequence showing the title and episode number. The episode numbers have been edited out and the episodes one, two, twenty-three and twenty-four have been omitted. What you get are five DVDs with four episodes on each DVD. I suggest you purchase a set that contains twenty-four episodes because things start abruptly at episode three in this release."
1,UTTERLY ANNOYING DVD - DO NOT BUY,"DO YOU ENJOY THE FIRST 5MIN OF ANY DVD WHERE YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO AN UN-CONTROLLABLE SERIES OF SCREENS? WELL HERE'S YOUR DVD: GROTESQUE HUMANOID IMAGE OF ""DVD PIRATE"" W/ SLOW-CRAWL FBI WARNING PRECEEDS PROLONGED & ANNOYING RAY-GUN SOUND EFFECTS & PRODUCTION CO. LOGOS.

EVER WANT A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE THAT SAYS, ""SHUT UP & JUST PLAY THE #$%& DVD !!! "". THIS DVD IS ANNOYING AS ALL HELL."
3,Cute in looks not in fit,"I bought these for my daughter's American girl dolls, they are very cute but they aren't the best fit. Hard to get on clearly not meant for these dolls."
4,"It's an OK book, except for Honey-love.","Cody Mcfadyen has a good, if disturbing, imagination and the guy can write. However, have you ever worked with someone who whistled all day? How about someone who calls everyone ""Honey-love""? Wouldn't you, at some point, either ask her to stop it or, if you lived in Smoky Barrett's world, simply shoot her? It was difficult enough to get used to a character named,""Smoky Barrett.""But, yeah, I ordered the next book. The guy can write a page-turner. As irritating as these two points are, I couldn't stop reading this book. Cody, if you read these things, enough of the honey-loves. Or, if you must continue, how about a serial killer who hates being called ""Honey-love""?"
5,Slow start but big bang ending!,"This is a very exciting book, a fantastic story that moves very quickly and smoothly from its dark start to its satisfying finish, with all the necessary horrific stops in between. I couldn't put it down once I started it. The protagonist Smokey Barrett is a keeper - likeable and real. Who the ""killer"" is comes as a surprise - and the telling as to why he is what he is fascinating."
3,"Gruesome murder, mystrey","Good but gruesome. Very explict which is a bit much for me. Love a good murder mystrey,can do without the in depth description of how to hack and take a human body apart. Overall good book, nice twist at the end. Not sure if would read any other books from this author."
5,Excellent reading,"This was an excellent read. A wonderful book by a new author. I can't fathom some of the negative reviews I read. Perhaps those folks should go back to reading ""See Tim Run"" or a similar kindergarten book."
3,Not available unabridged,It just BURNS me to have to order an abridged audio book. Just hoping the author or publisher looks at these reviews. What's the point of skipping half the story??? Grr..
4,Poor Man's Silence of the Lambs,"Good battle between some very bad (brutal) criminals, and a weakened profiler. Keeps you turning pages quickly."
1,Thomas Harris he ain't,"I gave up after reading the first fifty pages and absolutely nothing happened. I'm sorry I wasted $7.00 and ninety minutes of my life on this. The characters are cardboard, the narrative is endless and for a thriller, well...it's not very thrilling. Save your money on this one. Read this instead:Caught Stealing: A Novel"
4,an elegantly dark masterpiece,"This book stands above the typical serial killer fare because of Cody's incisive descriptions, cutting-edge research on the psychology of crime, and his beautifully terrifying use of language.This is fresh, gripping writing that I couldn't put down.The only reason I don't give it a 5 out of 5 was the lack of plot twists. The story moves steadily forward and most readers will guess the identity of the killer long before the revelation at the book's climax. Despite that, check this book out. I'm sure a writer as skilled as Cody will learn from this and make his next villain a little less evident. Keep up the good, chilling work!"
3,Shadow Man,Good book. Recommend to those who like mysteries and can handle Gore. Would like an explanation why Annie turned to porn.
1,Horrible,"Gruesome, violent, ridiculous plot, waste of time and money. I tossed it in the garbage. I would be ashamed to pass it along."
5,Best Book in a long time....,"This is one of the best books read in quite awhile. I read some pretty good books, but this was far superior to most. Alot of it has to do with the amazingly, clear, crisp writing along with well-fleshed out characters. Loved Smokey! Complicated, sypathetic, strong, powerful. Amazing book. I cannot recommend this book enough. READ IT! Would love to know more about this author and if any other books will be coming soon."
1,Cliche and Unimaginative,"I picked this one up from the library after having seen that Amazon recommended it as one of the best new thrillers. I was so disappointed. The characters are all one-dimensional and flat. And their names are bizarre... Smoky Barrett? Callie Thorne? (the name of an actress from the TV show Homicide, btw) The way they talk and the way the narrative reads is all extremely irritating and juvenile. And yes, the author throws in dime-store explanations for any typical detective work, i.e., the computer crimes detective having to explain the world of online porn, how IP tracking works, etc. It was distracting and condescending. The author couldn't decide if he was writing CSI for dummies, a pop psychology book for women who've experienced trauma, or a tongue-in-cheek satirical tribute to serial killer books. All three did not work. I'm sorry I wasted my time and sorrier still that Amazon recommended this title."
1,Poor characterizations,"This book was purchased by my son and given to me along with several others. I started to read it, but quit after a few chapters. I thought the characters were fawning, unimpressive beings and the description of the murders much more grotesque than necessary. For someone who revels in shock value, it might seem like a good book, but I thought it was poorly written and in a word, sickening. I hate to say anything detrimental about anyone, but this book brought out the desire to comment on it. I agree with another reviewer that the characters are cardboard, and I fail to understand how such prestigious publications as The Washington Post and Publishers Weekly could give kudos to it. Nina Riggs Jones, Make Little Weeping"
1,"$7 down the drain, just like that...","I rarely buy a book based on Amazon reviews, but I was hard up for something really good to read, so I gave ""Shadow Man"" a shot. Jeez, people, what book did you read? I threw this across the room after 60 pages. Paper cut-out characters, stilted dialogue, you name it. Its only saving grace: it'll make a perfect Lifetime movie. Oy. Any REAL thrillers out there??"
1,I was gravely disappointed in this book.,"Why and how it became a ""best"" of recommendation is more of a mystery than the one in the book. The book has flashes of good writing, but the majority of it is a cliche ridden exposition on how to write by formula. I found the characters unbelievable, the plot was almost nonexistent since it was obvious by the third chapter who the murderer was, and the dialogue sometimes painfully silly. The torture/rape/murder scenes were detailed to a disturbing degree. All in all a book to avoid."
2,Thomas Harris Move Over??? Whatever!!,"This wasn't the worst book I've read...I actually have mixed feelings...the killer was scary, twisted, etc. and some of the cops were very well developed as characters...but there was too much ""touchy/feely"" stuff in it for a serial killer book. That might sound lame but it's the only way I know how to put it...again, not the worst book...but the reviewers on the cover that said things to the effect of ""Thomas Harris move over...there's a new game in town.."" Whatever! There's no comparison between McFadyen and Harris...Harris is the master and McFadyen is...well...not the master!"
1,made me ill,"I enjoy scary serial killer novels as much as the next guy, but this one made me ill. Violence is ok when it serves a purpose in the story, but this one has way too much gratutious torture. I figured out who the killer was right away because he was practically wearing an ""I'm the killer"" sign on his chest. And these supposedly brilliant FBI agents never even focused on why the killer knew so much detail about each of the agents. Shouldn't this have made this suspicious that it could be someone ""in-house""? Just a sad, terrible story with no redeeming value. All the characters are either saints or devils. Just way too predictable to bother with."
3,C+ Thriller,"I like this kind of book. I'm a fan of Thomas Harris and the like. So, this one seemed up my alley. The structure was well put together and we knew what the main character's feelings and motivations should be from that, even if Mcfayden didn't always make them clear in his description. I found the narrative voice a bit jarring. At times it was overly abrupt, crisp and coldly procedural when it needn't have been while other times the writer made awkward attempts at imbuing it with a flowery lyrical quality that recalls ads for feminine hygiene products. Neither of these two were effective.The story moves quickly, perhaps too quickly. I was expecting more twists or surprises but the book held my skimming attention. My only other real problem with the book is that the dialogue has a tendency to be clunky and heavy handed at times.I would recommend this book to fans of the serial thriller genre with the one warning that they shouldn't expect too much."
3,More expensive with fewer features,"I own three Leatherman tools, ranging from the Micra to a huge do-all tool that lives in my car's toolbox, but after examining this unit (and the rest of the ""Juice"" series), I'm giving it a pass.Here's the problem: The Juice series is nothing more than existing models dressed up with plastic scales at a higher cost. The scales don't add any functional advantage; instead, they just provide a weak areak that can break if hit too hard or dropped on cement from a geat enough height. Even if you protect them from breaking the plastic will scratch over time and lose what attrativeness it may have.The beauty of the original Leatherman tools is that they're pure, rugged function. Solid stainless steel and they'll last a lifetime. Buy one of those and you won't regret it."
5,About the Glory,"I actually did something like this album on my own:gathered all the ""Glorias"" into one CD -and low and behold, here they are! Very special."
