2,cannot find an AC adapter that works with it,"The unit sttaes it will accept either power sources.....3) C batteries or a 9 v AC adapter. I have tried several and cannot find any that actually will work or power the unit. Anyone else find one that worked specifiaclly or perhaps my AC input connection is defective? Batteries work fine, but I don't want to have to change them every week!"
2,Disappointed,"Chime unit ordered for senior citizen relative. Received product as advertised. Button actuator fails. Inconsistent failures, difficult to isolate/locate reason for failures. Recommended unit to neighbor who purchased ""same"" and she wound up replacing the unit with another similar product from local hardware vendor ... and tossing this product into the garbage. Recommend ""find another solution"" if you are considering this product..."
3,Loud,this product is nice and loud. I'm not happy with the mounting material included. Haven't used it yet because of mounting problems for the outside bell button.
4,Glad I got it!,"This bell works great. I don't use the strobe, I just needed a wireless bell that I could hear anywhere in the house. This one is loud enough to hear from outdoors were the button is. The battery to run it is also reasonably priced and has lasted."
2,overpriced; good product; bad setup instructions,good product but very bad setup instructions. I couldn't understand it and misinterpreted it..and because of that the bell was just sitting in my closet until i could find enough time to decode the setup instructions. it was a frustrating experience. the bell works well and i am satisfied with its performance. A bit overpriced.
2,"""Made in China""","I couldn't get the sound to change from the default Westminster to the single tone. The instructions are not very clear on this. I tried to contact the company and was unable to, first because I couldn't get the feedback form to accept my e-mail address, and then after I got it to accept a third e-mail address, an error message came up that said ""You cann't (sic) sent message now"". So now what? They have a telephone number, but it's to China!"
3,nice glass,"but the goblet do break easily - two broke from amazon, 1 broke while cleaning, 2 broke from click. no more. but the tall beverage and wine glass seems more durable"
1,Glasses did not hold up.,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with Hanna glasses (4 iced teas, 12 goblets) Of the 16 Hanna glasses ordered, two were cracked upon arrival. All of the remaining glasses have small defects where pieces of glass in the bowl have flaked off, along with small fracture lines. I have thrown out 4 of the goblets with flakes, as I was afraid that they could release bits of glass into a beverage. Of the remaining 6 goblets and 4 iced teas, all have small fractures lines in the bowl of the glass. At this point, I have decided to throw them out, to avoid worry about inspecting them before using them each time. I really loved the look and heft of these glasses, and if they had been manufactured with an eye to quality I would be very happy indeed. However, these glasses have not lasted 2 years- not a great record."
5,"Not only the cats like it, so do the Javelinas!","My cats have loved this Purina One for over a year now, they will stare at a half full bowl as if to say ""Why isn't this full?""However, don't leave your garage door open in Gold Canyon, Arizona when Amazon just delivered a full 16lb bag. The Javelinas (wild pigs) like this better than the cats! They show their gratitude by distributing it all over the garage, down the driveway and into the street, where I found the empty bag!"
1,Beware of allergic reactions,"I don't know whether it was the high fat content spurring on feline acne (food literally leaves a grease stain on her nose after eating it) or just an allergic reaction, but this food gave my kitten some pretty bad swelling, redness, and slight hair loss around the lips. I was forced to switch brands after a move recently and noticed the sores went away, finally found this brand again after a few weeks, and the sores promptly returned. Now I have her back on another brand, and within a week of switching the sores went away again."
4,"Good Item, but There's Better Value Out There,","Returned this Amp because it was no better than my very good, 50% cheaper ""Upbeat Audio T613-BNC Boostaroo for All Audio Application"""
2,"Too much noise, no bass","This amp definitely makes things louder, too bad it also adds a substantial amount of hiss as well. It also seems to amplify only the higher range frequencies as well, since the bass volume through my Sennheiser HD555 actually lowers when using this, but the highs are almost too loud and makes the mix of most songs sound very weak. I am going to return this for the cheaper Boosteroo since I have read that it adds no noise at all, hopefully it is true."
3,It does the job.,This works. It greatly increases the level on my headphones. I do not like the AAAA batteries and no on/off switch.
4,Camera battery charger,This has worked well for me but I have found that Duracell rechargeables hold up better. The charger works fine for them also.
4,Necessary asserory for the camera,The recharger is first class and a necessity. The technology goes along with the camera which is amazing to me and excellent.
3,A Little Light on the Color Theory,"I just picked this book up from the library, and have decided not to buy it. As you can see from the below reviews, it does indeed contain some useful technical advice, but nothing that you could not read in any primer on Photoshop, Dreamweaver or general web design book. I was hoping to find a book elaborating on color theory, color schemes & color psychology, but no such luck. You get about 10 pages about this, then it moves on to calibrating monitors, applying anti-aliasing and creating layers in Dreamweaver. Not recommended if you need a deeper insight into color theory."
4,Good solid cable,"It is just as described, a good solid cable that works fine, nothing exceptional about it, but then again, it is just a USB cable!"
1,Rank amateur,"I had ordered this DVD so I could show it to my students who are reading O Henry stories. I was disappointed; the acting is so amateur; and the ""frame"" for presenting the stories is so corny. So I hunted for the 1951 film ""O Henry's Full House"" (Fred Allen, Marilyn Monroe) and finally found it on eBay. It may be 50 years older, but it's much better!"
2,For beginners,"I purchased this book for a class (legal technology) which turned out to be as remedial as this book. While I believe it could be very useful for someone who is not used to navigating a computer, it really insults the intelligence of those of us who have grown up with technology. This book does have a few useful tips that clarify certain aspects of Concordance and other legal programs, but I find it easier to explore an unfamiliar program on my own without the tedious step-by-step process Roper uses in his lessons."
2,"Informative, but.....","I purchaed this book for a Paralegal class. I had two very bad experiences with the book. First, the first copy I received had no Appendix in it, so I had to send it back. It was unfortunate, as I needed the Appendix to do an assignment. Secondly, the software that was provided was expired when I tried to load it into my laptop to do homework. I called the publishing company and they promised to send me a new disk; two weeks later and I still have not received it.I will keep it as a reference source, but I hope that another book will be written for future students. If you do not need it for a class, PLEASE look for another book."
1,Don't even bother!!,"As a student in a legal secretary program, I was required to buy this book, as it is part of the curriculum. Well let me be the first to say that it is a total waste of the [money] I paid for it! It is filled with typos and instructional errors. Before I can learn the software it is supposed to be teaching me, I have to first decypher the directions. I may as well just wing it, the book is no help. I recommend to anyone about to purchase this book, to think again. Look for a book you might actually learn from!"
1,This be expensive,Lots of money to pay for a book that is probably less involved then most and babies you beginning with a Microsoft word document. The only reason I am buying it is for a Paralegal Class and the teacher is even confused by some of the things that pop up. Don't waste your money if you can avoid buying this book!
1,Mandatory purchase that disappointed me,"My legal secretary class was required to purchase this book at a costly price. I had problems with it from the start! Typo's, instructional errors, How are you supposed to learn? I regretfully have to recommend against it."
5,kipper the corgie,"my son loves kipper's show and his books, we read every day.btw, kipper is an english corgie."
1,Never received Item,"I paid double the amount for the item in order to receive a two-day delivery. Not only did the item not arrive in the two-day delivery promised, but, the item never arrived at all. I have therefore lost my money on this deal. I am going to begin the long and difficult process of trying to get a refund from this seller."
1,Save your money for something else.,"Horrible interface which can leave you in the dark. After experiencing 20 minutes of limited route creation you wonder if this industry learned about cross-over rails. Unrealistic too in that larger aircraft can carry more cargo than a train consist. Stick to the more developed sims; RR Tycoon, Transport Tycoon (if you can find it); even Trade Empires is vastly superior."
3,use your money elsewhere,"Industry Giant is a soild game with a good concept for $..., but it definately gets boring too soon because you just don't have enough choices and options. It's always either so easy it bores you or so hard it's not fun anymore. The graphics aren't all that great either. All in all, I suggest Traffic Giant by JoWood instead."
1,Humm humm humnmm,"I ordered this cable after reading all the positive reviews. Cable shipped quickly, had it at my door in two days.I was excited and ready to test it out, take it for a test drive if you may say. I made my connections and almost immediately, I got a hum out of my amplifiers speakers. I tried a different amp with no success. So, I put back my original cable and the hum is no longer there. This cable is horrible, however if you are into the hum scene, go ahead and purchase one. I will say this about the cable, it does look like it is solid or put together nicely. Too bad, I am getting this hum, I was looking forward to to hearing my daughter sing.I am packing this cable as I speak and will be returning it for full refund.I am a technical person, have been a systems consultant for 30 years, so I know a little about cables."
3,MICROPHONE CABLE,"Very fast shipment. This mic cable is okay, but I have a feeling that I will need to purchase more in a couple of months. Anyway, it alright to use, just make sure that you buy two or three so you don't have to worry about getting any more mic cables for a while."
4,Decent cable for a reasonable price,"I like Planet Waves products in general and this continues my support. While not the most expensive end connectors the cable is decently made and is a good value. Quiet, flexible cable and decent connectors."
5,Life Time Warranty!!!!!,If this warranty stuff realy works you can't go wrong ....paid under 17.00 with shipping they look good have a sturdy rugged feel so i hope to never return them but it says on the package Life time Warranty..we will see...either way I will revise with what ever happens
5,Armchair fishing,"If you're a flyfisher, you really need this book for when the season is closed. But don't expect Walden to give you any excuse to sit home when the weather is bad or the water is high. He approaches fishing with a fly as a higher calling for which a little suffering is to be expected. I loved his descriptions of summer-time angling in low, clear eastern chalk streams, but also those of wading upstream, chest deep in sub-freezing water, casting between ther chucnks of ice and trying to watch his fly floating down among the snowflakes."
3,"Okay, but Prefer Kung Fu Hustle","The movie was alright. I expect it would mean more to someone who knows the game of majong. Much of the movie centers on majong gameplay.I purchased this used when I saw the ties to Kung Fu Hustle. Parts of Kung Fu Hustle get a bit rough, but it is very imaginitive and entertaining. Bet to Basic even borrowed a minor element from Kung Fu Hustle."
4,Very small but flat indesign,I have a similar necklace that broke that was 3D in design. this one is flat not as nicely designed as other. Cross is small but good quality and easy to wear.
4,Pretty necklace but very small pendant,"I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. I received the item in plenty of time - fast ship, but the pendant is VERY small. It is pretty and my daughter likes it, but was disappointed about the size. The quality seems fine as well with no tarnishing or discoloration so far."
4,"nice, but...",i got this for my wife as a late xmas present it is very flattering but it was a bit smaller then i imagined...
2,"TINY, TINY, TINY, TINY","This item is TINY. I wanted to wear it myself, but it is way too small. I will send it to my 3 year old niece."
3,It's smaller than we envisioned.,We liked the style but the size was smaller than we thought it would be. Ended up giving it to our granddaughter as a gift.
3,not quite the 'wow' factor I expected,Got this for my wife. She wore it a few times but hasn't since. It doesn't seem to have the 'wow' factor of some other jewelry I have gotten her.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is. I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child. The necklace may be 18"", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for. So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece. What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult. Never have found one yet."
5,This was a gift,"She loves the cross, I thought it was a little bigger than it was but she loved it as it was."
3,"Sterling Silver Eternity Cross Pendant, 18""","The pendant is too small, I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger. But you pay for what you get!"
3,Picture is deceiving.,"The cross design is really unique but it is much smaller than shown, wish it was a little bigger. The measurement says its about an inch large but it's not."
2,The surface of the actual product is flat,It's a delicate pendant. The length is about the size of a penny coin. The actual product has a flat surface across the whole pendant while the pictures shows more 3-D looking loops. I suggest Amazon includes additional pictures to show product from an angle. The length of the chain is 18 inches which is same as the description.
3,Attractive cross,My wife loved this unusual cross but the chain necklace was difficult to hook because the chain links are too small to go over the lock link. We had to buy a replacement necklace at a nearby jewelry store for $15.
4,Wonderful Gift!,My girlfriend loved this. I got it for her for Christmas. It's not too big and not too small and the quality of the metal is top notch.
1,Not like the picture,The picture on amazon looks amazing. The actual piece is flat not 3D and has a dull metalic look nothing like the shine of the one in the photo.
3,Tiny pendant for a tiny price,It's very small... almost child like. I am embarassed to give this as a gift but it's too late to return and buy something else
2,Not happy,the pendant is very small and light and has a cheap silver finish that does not look like our other sterling products. The return postage makes it not practical to refund. We were very regretful with this purchase.
3,its okay,thought it looked more 3d in the picture and bigger but for that price she liked it and thought it was great
4,Pretty,Its a great necklace that I got for my girlfriend. The only issue is I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger cross. It is still a great reminder of the eternal gift that we have been given.
1,Too tiny,"The picture was pretty, but the cross is SO SO tiny...as small as the nail on my pinky finger. I meant it as a gift, but went shopping for something else."
5,It's perfect.,"I love this necklace. It's prettier than I thought it would be. People have been writing how small it is. Well, it's exactly the size I thought it would be. It's dainty, but elegant. I'm going to buy a few more for gifts."
2,chain was so small and tiny,I bought this as a gift for a younger teenager and I think it is nice enough for the price. I got it at a promotional price. the charm was nice but the chain was so small and tiny you couldn't grab it to fasten it. wouldn't recommend.
5,The beautiful Eternity Cross makes a great gift,"After purchasing two of these crosses for myself and my sister, I decided that it would not only make a wonderful piece of Christian jewelry, but also a great way to illustrate the special, undending bonds among the women in my family and close circle of friends. I have since purchased 8 additional Eternity Crosses to share. After a year of daily wear, mine is still like new."
5,Patty V.,I like this necklace very much. I can remove the cross and wear it with a longer necklace if I wish. It's very dainty and I enjoy wearing it.
2,Very disappointed!,"I am very disappointed in this necklace/pendant. It is way smaller than I expected. In the amazon.com description it said, 'small' but this is smaller than a dime. The chain is shorter than 18"" even with the 2"" extender. I think this should be listed as a young persons necklace/pendant...maybe for a petite teen or someone. I gave it 2 stars only because I think a teen would love it, and the fit would be more appropriate. I think I will take the cross off of the chain and hang it (the cross) on my charm bracelet. :)Next time show the size next to a coin or something so we have an idea of the exact size of jewelry, etc."
4,"Great price, but SMALLER than you think it will be.",This is a very small cross. Be sure to find the size and realize how small it is. This is more for a small child than an adult. It would be helpful if one of their pictures compared it to a dime or had ruler measurements so you understand how small it is. Over all I am very happy for something that is less than $20.
2,Very Small,"The cross is very pretty, but much smaller than I had anticipated. I was hoping for one a bit larger to give as a gift."
3,Very Interesting,"If you want to know something about the concept of ""Ether"", this is a good source. A little dry at times, but good info."
1,Preposterous nonsense,"I note that a previous reviewer suspects that we negative reviewers have an agends. Well I do: I wish to promote the critical reading of books like this, that make grand assertions from a position of profound ignorance, with no substantive evidence to back them up.If you believe this book, you have to believe that every theoretical physicist in the world is either a dupe or complicit in a giant conspiracy. That is both insulting and ridiculous, but what can you expect from a man who thinks that iron is a product of photosynthesis?And this supposed international conspiracy hasn't managed to stop him selling details of his 'free energy' device for $10 a pop to anyone who wants it? Yeah, right."
1,Occult Ether Physics:Tesla's Space Propulsion System,"This is a poorly written book about highly technical subjects. The author has a degree in Fine Arts, which doesn't qualify him to describe a highly technical subject (gravity, free energy, electromagnitism, etc). The writing style is rambling, sometimes incoherent and he uses words which aren't in the dictionery. I am unaccustomed to reading a paragraph of 8-10 lines which is only one sentence. He is discussing subjects which are related to quantum physics and similar energy fields, in which I think his research poorly defines the subject he is trying to describe."
5,Pure Genius,Anyone who has studied Tesla will be very pleased with the easy to understand style that Lyne brings to an intentionally complicated subject. This is a must have for any conspiracy enthusiast!
4,Love it,"I obviously love this little clock,as I have ordered at least 20 in the past. I give them as gifts. However, the ones I have in my house go bad. The FACE gets either rusty or black spots on them. Just wondering if anyone else has that problem."
1,Tiny lil thing,It is a tiny clock that glows completely like a light bulb...i wanted a clock whose only hands glowed in the dark..this one is like a like green bulb more to say..and can only be read at night when its plugged in ...a waste for people who only need glow clocks..and waste of ELECTRICITY
5,For the price its GREAT!,"I've had some time with this scope and I highly suggest anybody that needs a good zoom and great mid dot scope to consider. I couldn't find this on any airgun websites, if I did it would be so much more higher priced. I love it, recently purchased higher rings to mount it on my gamo big cat. Love it!!!"
4,Great for Airsoft,"Bought for an airsoft rifle and it's great. Focus as close as 15ft, and lower power zoom perfect for close range fun. I found the adjusters took a bit of getting used to and not as enjoyable as my previous BSA scope (screw off the protective cap then adjust click by click). With this scope you use a hex wrench, but it's not immediately obvious that the goal is to back it off just a bit."
2,Faulty product after recent use. Stuck turrets led to the adjustment screw heads breaking off.,Optics are good but the turrets were inconsistent and unreliable. I received this product and tried to finally make adjustments and the turrets adjustments screws were stuck and broke off. I also had passed the return policy of 4/1. I'm hoping to call the Amazon company and if not Centerpoint to see what can be done as this was faulty product.
5,Opera Novice,"First, thanks to the seller for even offering a CD like this for a great price. Second, I'm trying to broaden my opera experiences by listening to a variety of artists and their arias. For example, I've heard of Callas but have never heard Callas (I know, I know - I said I was a novice.) I want to listen a few more times - and I really like that all these wonderful artists are still available."
1,"Good, but they forgot one little thing... CALLAS!","The CD is good, overall, but there is an unforgivable omission here... there is not even one aria sung by Callas. Callas is the ultimate diva for us opera queens, so I can't really understand why she isn't here.Buy it, but you've been warned."
2,Re-issue of Solo Films from other DVDs!,A word about this DVD: UN-RESTORED!Collectors of Laurel & Hardy films on DVD will already have superior copies of these solo films!One other problem: The 'Menu'. It only shows frame grabs from the shorts and you have to guess what the title of the short is.MUD AND SAND (1923) - Stan Laurel (already on the BRENTWOOD DVD).ORANGES AND LEMONS (1923) - Stan Laurel (superior copies are on the LOST FILMS OF L&H; #2 and the KINO STAN LAUREL COLLECTION).WEST OF HOT DOG (1924) - Stan Laurel (a superior copy is on the KINO STAN LAUREL COLLECTION).BROMO AND JULIET (1926) - Charley Chase & Oliver Hardy ( a superior copy is on the LOST FILMS OF L&H; #3 DVD).CRAZY LIKE A FOX (1926) - Charley Chase & Oliver Hardy ( a superior copy is on the LOST FILMS OF L&H; #6 DVD).
3,"ok, but too hard to remove hair","my cat likes this brush, but its too hard to remove the hair from it. i eventually went with a metal one."
4,Purr Purr Purr,"...says my cat. She really loves the feel of this brush. As another reviewer said, the hair is not easy to remove from between the bristles, but for a cat with shorter hair this is the best brush that I have found. The handle fits comfortably in my hand and the head of the brush is larger than most. I would recommend this product, although I am reserving one star because it is Made in China."
5,Why do people stay during a hurricane? One answer: Enjoying the Anarchy,"This short video gives people who live outside the hurricane zone real insight into what goes on the minds of those who stay (even when they rue that later to some extent). Short answer: for the anarchy, and the bonding that takes place during a crisis. While the water pours into the house, one man's sons stay the course, while he drives from emergency to emergency in the storm. Apparently he was worried about them alone in his house, but left them to their trial by water.A heartwarming bonding moment in disaster is captured here, not in Hollywood style, but in a much more realistic dynamic between a father and the sons who follow his lead in sitting out Katrina."
3,Bumpers are too thick,"As everyone else states the fabrics are really nice. However the bumpers are more like pillows then pads. My little one kept getting her head stuck under them. We still use the skirt, blanket and sheet and really like them."
4,The smell of trechery is in the wind.........,"With friends like these..........A murderous rage dwell within more than one character in this film....some in a hurricane force...and in others like a soft gentle festering breeze.A very good low budget thriller, full of twists and turns. The acting is fairly good. A little wooden in spots, but it doesn't destroy the tension. However, one big plot hole is what made one charcter kill another over a card. The motivation doesn't really jell for me, nor does his flash rage. Where did it come from? Why was he angry over a card to a girl he is just friends with and not really involved with deeper? This is never really explained. Maybe that was one of the links to the title...he emotionally shifts like the wind?I do reccomend this little thriller. In fact...I will rewatch this several times in the future."
2,Covers basics of the program without many useful suggestions,"While the book does cover the basic elements within the program, it doesn't explain why or when you would want to use the features, nor give good examples of what can be done with each feature. This is a book designed for beginners, and the level is correct. But, beginners more than anyone need tips and examples to get up and running. So, save your money, and do the tutorials that came with Ray Dream. Then, you can get a truly useful book like Ray Dream Handbook by Sledd."
1,Doesn't Work for Everyone,"Despite following all directions and using for several weeks, the product did not work for my mother at all. Did not relieve any symptoms for any amount of time."
3,"Should be subtitled ""The Decline and Fall of Chauntecleer""","As a sequel to ""The Book of the Dun Cow,"" it's quite different, definitely less loving, less beautiful. Lord Chauntecleer helps and harms those who are entrusted to his rule, with favorite characters needlessly losing their lives. I expected ""The Book of Sorrows"" to uplift from sorrow, not to mire in it. The only reason I can find to read it is to finalize what Wangerin wrote.The Book of Sorrows"
5,"A painful, yet hauntingly beautiful, tale","I've read the prequel - the Book of the Dun Cow - over a dozen times.I have only been able to read the Book of Sorrows twice in the past 15 years. It is a gut-wrenching tale, all the more so because the author is so eloquent in his prose that I feel I know the various characters personally (that they are animals is irrelevant) and the pain they feel and the sorrows they endure hit me at a deep level.I'm a guy, and very few things would make me cry (such as the loss of a loved one). This book did.I'm steeling myself up to read it again this year, and then it will find its way back onto my bookshelf for another 5-10 years before I have the strength to get through it again."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"Not for children, not for the weak hearted, not for the empathetic. This book pulls no punches and is more full of hurt and gut-wrenching violence than many others known for gratuitous violence.It certainly is moving and leaves a lasting impression - I wish I hadn't read it because I can never erase the terrible images from my mind. I didn't find it uplifting, only disturbing, and I wish I had had someone to warn me before reading it.Sorry but I'm giving it only 2 stars because, while the author's writing is superb, the rating should reflect that the content is not appropriate for everyone.I strongly recommend reading the author's *wonderful* book, The Book of the Dun Cow, one of the best and most uplifting I have ever read."
1,Avery Cardoza's Slam-Tilt Pinball,"I NEVER ""RECIEVED"" THIS PINBALL GAME. I WROTE AND TOLD YOU THAT AT LEAST 3 OR MORE TIME'S YOU NEVER CARED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. REVIEW THHE RECORDS ON THIS GAME, YOU WILL SEE I TRIED TO GET THE GAME RESENT AND YOU WOULD'NT EVEN DO THAT. I AM NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER, AND THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS RESEND THE GAME OR GIVE ME A REFUND.Arnold J Mount"
2,Abnormality constant,"Bought one about two weeks ago and the one I received had one cord about a foot longer than the other. Bought it in store to see if it was an isolated incident, and that one had the same problem (though it is a plus if you only need it in one ear). If you're going to buy it, do it where you can return it. Other than that, great sound, amazing comfort (even good on opposite ear), and a lasting product."
2,sound was good while it lasted,Okay my pair that I bought lasted a little over 2 weeks. not to great right but my sisters have lasted for over 3 months now. I dont know if it was my pair or my sisters pair is the abnormail ones. you should buy sony h.ear i bought those and they work great
3,Creative Popular Tools,"This book sums up the some popular management tools to be used in public organizations with the intent of helping them to meet citizens demands of highest quality service. Including Strategic Planning, Total Quality Management, Re-Engineering, Benchmarking, Outsourcing, many approachments (or tools) that can be useful in restructuring public organizations are told in this valuable book. Readers who want to understand the basic principles of popular management tools developed for private sector organizations (but can be applied to public sector)should read this book. One of the obvious weaknesses of the book is its cases which were not well-developed.Overall, I recommend Cohen's book to readers who have spare time."
2,Didn't work so well for us,I didn't have a good experience with this product. Didn't function that well.I get better results from brining along a big ziploc bag during my runs and putting my ipod in the ziploc bag if it starts to rain.
2,Horrible Tech Support,Purchased multiple products from Speco. Tech support refuses to talk to you unless you are an authorized installer. Really? yet they sell their products to the end user. Call tech support before you buy to confirm that they will provide phone support. Product seems to work fine (I think...)if you are OK with this policy.
1,Disappointed,"I bought about five of these for Xmas gifts plus one for myself. They were okay at first, but none of them work now. My friends were embarrassed to tell me. The product doesn't hold the ""crank"" charge and even then, not all the lights work. I took one on a camping trip, and it was of no use. Furthermore, I contacted Amazon to help me contact the company but they had no information. I also could not find this company online with contact information."
1,Wrong Item?,"I was notified that items shipped were incorrect and that the product listed was not what they really had. So, its listed incorrectly on amazon. Kind of depressing!"
4,Unique Offering,Nothing else like it for sale. Production values good but not excellent. Very credible story-telling. A must see if you are a fan of Vegas or Rat Pack.
1,Beware of voltage!,"Beware -- this heater is a 120 V AC. It really doesn't say in the information. Ordered one and realized that it was no use, so wasted my money and time. Ordered from Hydrosil as they have a much clearer website."
2,Hair of the dog that bit your anckle?,"Yes, they're lovely. They're shapely. They kick a fierce pon, but with side effects. The heal wrinkles up with use which then wears blisters into your achilles tendon. Disappointment to follow:"
5,Orange Orange Everywhere,"I was looking for a new snack item. Someone told me to look for flavored popcorns. Not sure what to expect when I purchased this.Well...Pleasantly surprised. The taste is a cross between Cheetos and Cheesits. Popcorn pops very well with only 10-12 un-popped kernels. BE PREPARED! Messy popcorn but Oh So Good! The coloring is as expected orange. You can confirm this by touching anything after you have a handful. Paper towels are a must. Addictive, Messy, Easy to Prepare, what more can you expect of a snack."
1,"Even the dog won't eat this, seriously!","I read all of the good reviews of this popcorn and was hoping that it would be at least halfway decent. I like food to be more salty than most, but this was far too salty. There is also almost no cheese taste and it has kind of a bad after taste too. After eating about 1/8 of a bag I just couldn't eat anymore. I dumped the rest into the dog's dish because she eats anything, even veggies. She wolfed down several bites but then refused to eat anymore of it and I had to throw the rest out. I think I'll leave the remaining bags by the microwave at work and donate the unopened boxes to a food shelf. Avoid this stuff at all costs!"
1,Worst popcorn I have ever eaten!,"I am a popcorn aficionado. I normally only buy Redenbacher, but tried this stuff since I had a coupon. It was terrible! Does not taste like cheese at all. Tastes like someone took dirt and garlic powder, burned it with a blowtorch, and sprinkled it on the popcorn. Also, this product is a dark orange-brown color which looks awful. It smells, tastes, and looks nasty. Do not buy this stuff!"
5,Jolly Time big cheez popcorn,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little sceptic, but this popcorn is addictive my husband took some to work and everyone wants to get some. He left the bag in the break room and when he returned it was all gone.I'ts really good."
1,Cheese popcorn review,This product is not worth the money. There is not a cheese taste/flavor as much as a salty/chemical taste.
4,Cuppy Humor for Fishermen and Nature Lovers,"Very funny if you like dry humor. Had me laughing out loud. Fishing ""advice"" covers topics from minnows and carp to salmon and pike. Additional chapters on Reptiles, Dinosaurs, and Insects. ""The Salmon have strange ideas; they are afraid of parsley and slices of lemon."" ""Aristotle's discovery that snakes and fish have no feet is a keen bit of observation for an ancient Greek."" One can sense that Carlin and Seinfeld took some lessons from Cuppy's observational humor."
3,NOT FULL SIZE BINDER,THIS IS VERY SMALL AND THE PRINT ALSO. Lots of same ol' same ole' and not very much on new. I myself was going to use it to put in pages but turns out not to be the normal size paper (8x11) but is about 4x6. I did not find any new recipes and they only use there (sirra) recipes.
2,Misrepresentation of Goods,"I ordered this manual and cd from LG Outdoors. when I received the manual,there was no cd included. i contacted LG Outdoors about this and they told me that it was a listing error and that the cd was not included. they told me if i sent the manual back ,they would refund my money and i could then reorder the manual and cd at an increased cost. I asked them to send me the cd and that would resolve the issue. they stated they would not send a cd and that the listing error was amazons fault. i have not had any response in two weeks from this companyBUYER BEWARE ! THEY ARE USING BAIT AND SWITCH TACTICS! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM LG OUTDOORS!!the manual itself is great !"
3,Not bad but not exactly what I was hoping for.,"Good album but I think the songs lost some of their punch from the originals when they go acoustic. Which is normal but usually variations in the music can make up for it.But ""Time"" with Roy Harper is very good. This CD might be worth getting just for that song. At the used price of $5.00 but not $17.00"
3,mediocre audio quality,"Acceptable for sharing audio out of an iPod, a portable dvd player, or any other source that wasn't too good to begin with. I wouldn't use it with any really serious pair of headphones or with any well made mp3 player, it noticeably detracts from the audio quality of my iAudio X5. If you're shopping for something to help your mp3 player drive a really good pair of cans, or if you have an ear for good sound, keep looking."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was really disappointed with this product. I was hoping that it would amplify the signal of my mp3 player because I wasn't getting good volume through the auxiliary jack in my car. It boosted the volume a little bit, but not enough to warrant using it regularly.More than that, the battery case doesn't click shut. I had to tape it shut. This isn't a quality product."
3,Not sure if it's worth it,"I was tired of having to charge my MP3 player every week-or-so so I thought this little device might help. It does do what it says, that is boost the signal of the player so I don't have to crank it up as much, but I'm not sure it's all that great.The main problem I seem to have with this thing is that the extra cord you need connects the device to the stereo and the short (about a 10"" long) cord that comes out of the device is what is plugged into the MP3 player. The problem with this is when I change the song I have to pick up the device along with my player to do so. It would work much better if the short cord plugged into the stereo and the extra cord went to my player.The other problem is that it does boost the signal, but not that much. Before I had my player's volume at about 22, now I have it about 18. The device helps, but not all that much. I would be completely happy with this device if those two flaws were corrected."
2,OO... er... Where's the Boost?,"Just received my boosteroo (purchased to boost the signal from my Ipod Touch to my earphones and to my auto aux port). Very Disappointing... despite claim of ""up to"" 2X power amplification, volume stayed basically the same.... Works great as a splitter, but there is little to no power boost."
4,Just that little extra,"I wasn't expecting much but this unit really does give a boost of about 10-15% to my untrained ear. This allows the use of larger headphones for home use etc. My Sennheiser HD555 responded very well to the extra power, with a fuller deeper bass and a ""rounder"" all around sound. Also works pretty well as a kind of ""pre-amp"" if plugged into an Aux port in your car.The down side is the unit isn't small and portable in any way and is pretty much a sit and listen kind of unit.If you just want a nice boost and don't care about audiophile class sound quality, it'll be money well spent.( follow up edit ) It shines as a pre amp for the AUX port in a car. If you use an MP3 or Ipod in your car you know how much you have to crank the volume on both the player and the car stereo to get decent volume which results in distortion. This unit allows volume without distortion, saves the charge in the player and it's bulk isn't so much of an issue in a car."
4,Nice unit for what it does,"I use my Boostaroo to power up my /mp3 player to play through my motorcycle helmet speakers. It works well, and the battery life is very good."
4,boostaroo is best bang for buck,"This amp is a steal for what it does. I boosts good clear sound in lower volumes and peaks well above comfortable headphone volume. Great for plane trains and subways. If ipod is on bass boost and you crank it it will crack with distortion so turn it down a smidge or turn off the eq. Sounds great on ipods acoustic setting. I primarily use it for my snowboard jacket speakers to boost the tunes while shreddin. Thanks boostaroo. Also, I recommend good headphones with a seperate volume dial to help cont it peaks."
1,Didn't work for me,I tried the T613-BNC for my my iPhone 4s and OTH headphones to see if it would help enhance the sound. It did make it louder but I noticed NO impovement to the quality. For others this may be the desired effect.The tests were made playing several 320 kpbs songs.In addition the device is fragile the patch cord is too short and produced static while using.Review the TOS as the seller promptly reminded me of their policy.YOU MUST PAY FOR return shipping and a re-stocking fee.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!PS: I have downgraded this to 1 star after re-testing by a 3rd party.
1,Piece of Junk - do not purchase,"I purchased this item to use with my iPad on a long trip both as an amplifier and splitter so my wife and I could watch movies. The item was defective out of the box. I opened the item, packed it in my computer back and left for my trip. When the item didn't work I attempted to return it and the seller wouldn't accept it because I didn't have the original packaging. Do not buy this item and do not use this seller. Horrible experience that Amazon shouldn't endorse."
5,Does exactly as stated,"Works with every MP3 player I have, and boosts all of them sufficiently to use with portable speakers and a Bose Accoustic Wave Radio.Well worth the modest investment."
5,MP3 Audio booster,"Product was as expected, good price and shipped promptly. Would buy from this seller again. I would have liked to be able to increase or decrease the volume instead of just on and off but this is not a high end amp."
5,What Can't He Do !!!,"This is an awesome album. One of those albums where there is a lot of pre production charts, songs, musicians arrangers etc.But the dividends pay off because it sounds great, the choice of songs ..incredible and the arrangements will knock your socks off. It still sounds fresh today. The sound quality of this cd is pretty good but not as good as a good vinyl copy which really sparkles. The music might put some people off because it is Jazz from an earlier time, but to me it is great music most of which I have never heard before."
5,satisfied and stupefied..,"I'm certainly not the only guitar player out there with a smile on his face after listening and re-listening to this amazing guy..he makes the strings continue to sound long after he has left them, if you follow..I don't really resonate so much with the record's cultural bite into the history of jazz; rather I see its influence on several of my favorite players: James Taylor, all the finger-style guys...and gals, Sting, some of the Brazilian masters, etc. For me this recording epitomizes greatness and inspiration channeled through music."
2,"Great album, but dull and lifeless remastering job kills it","Okay, this is either sheer perversity or the people who remastered this Cooder series had burned out the treble circuitry on the board by the time they got to Jazz. Instead of the usual extreme treble increase, Jazz has had a major cut, leaving it dull and lifeless and with no high end to speak of. The gold standard here is the Mobile Fidelity LP, which IS a little warmer and smoother than the domestic CD, but the vinyl is still very clear and detailed. The old CD isn't bad, but it sounds brittle compared to the MFSL album. It's still much better than this Japanese mini-LP-sleeve version, though."
3,OK. Some good tips but little practice problems.,"That sums it up. I got 4 GRE prep books, and this one offers the least amount of practice problems. At times I felt like the authors try a little too hard to build a rapport with the readers by making negative comments about ETS, the people who write the actual GRE's. Aside from that, there are some pretty good test-taking tips, but they are not necessarily presented in the most organized or easily remembered fashion. I suggest looking around a little bit before making this purchase."
3,A beginner's Guide,"This book is meant for anyone who is starting with Sonar. It starts with some bare basics that, in my opinion, are useless since anyone using Sonar will already be VERY familiar with digital audio basics. All those pages could have been dedicated to more advanced stuff. There is a serious need for ADVENCED level books for serious and dedicated musicians... For Sonar users, you better be not recording nursery jingles.... its for advanced production..BUT, there is tons of valuable info for beginners, and some useful tips for even advanced users... Overall value of this book is medium."
1,Did NOT like an earlier version of this book...,"I had bought an earlier version of this book and didn't find it worth the money. At times I felt like I was better off going through the help file in SONAR than reading this book as it looked like the book was doing just that. It's just my opinion. Other people may find it useful. So, there's my 2 cents..."
5,Miele delivery,"These are the bags you have to use if you own certain Miele vacuum cleaners. You can get in your car and drive around looking for these bags, which can be hard to find, and you often pay exorbitant prices, or you can order them on Amazon for a lot less, join Amazon Prime and have them delivered in two days, saving you wasted gas and shipping. Enough said!"
4,Ejection,So far the toaster has been fine. Toasting seems to be uniform. I frequently just want one piece of toast and when I do the toast has been ejected onto the counter top on several occasions.
3,"Hey, it's only a Toaster","While The Cuisinart name implies quality, I don't expect alot from my toaster. HEY, it's only a toaster. I purchased the reconditioned model and was surprised by the appearance of it when it arrived. It looked great. And then, when I used it for the first time I was surprised by the choices I was afforded for degree of darkness. It worked great. And then, the first time I fished around inside with a fork I was surprised by the, no, not the shock of it all, but the roomy opening I had to work with. It worked great. Now, if I could only figure out what how to time the finished product with the readiness of my eggs.....it would be perfect."
3,Great Eye candy,"This is without a doubt the smartest looking toaster on the market. There are a few problems, however. The slots can't accommodate any toast that isn't standard size. It also has an annoying habit of popping the toast completely ""out"" of the toaster. However, looks won out for me."
1,Like New???,"I thought I'd take a chance on this Factory-Reconditioned item since the item was described as ""Like New"". Well if scratched and a huge dent is considered like new then I guess I got what I paid for. I would possibly live with the dent if it were in a less conspicuous location. It seems that buying a Cuisinart Factory-Reconditioned item is a game of russian roulette as far as physical condition is concerned. Now I have the pleasure of paying for the return shipping."
4,"Great value for reconditioned, but toasting is uneven","I wouldn't hesitate to go the reconditioned route again, but I think I got one that has the bottom-toasts-darker-than-the-top problem. Both slots seem to have the same degree of this problem. The toast comes out either not toasted enough at the top, or too dark at the bottom, depending on how high the setting is (duh). Don't know if this will get worse over time, I've only had it about a month. Otherwise it seems well-constructed and looks great. It only had one or two tiny dings in the surface when I got it."
2,okay,I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. after reading the good reviews I thought it would be a heavy quality made toaster. I am glad I didn't pay more than I did because it doesn't feel heavy or like quality. I have to leave it on number one or the toast comes out black. I thought cuisinart was always quality. I don't think that anymore...
2,Blew up,I bought this toaster because I felt it looked like a basic toaster with a good name attached to it. This morning it blew up and I haven't owned it two years yet. FYI very disappointed.
2,"Weak toasting, rocker launcher spring","I purchased this model new and have been disappointed. In order to toast many craft breads -like those from Great Harvest- I usually need to run them through twice because the heat control doesn't go high enough. Also, when I toast something that doesn't weigh very much -such as half an English muffin- the toaster will usually toss it into the air and onto the floor. Two calls to the company brought no relief."
5,Great,It is fast to toast and easy to clean. Great browning adjustment. Looks good in kitchen. A piece of art.
5,Best decision I ever made when buying a toaster!,"I was a bit hesitant to order a ""reconditioned"" toaster. I now can say that I have never been happier about my decision. It looks great! It works the same as a new one (I know because my friend has the same one which she paid full price for) and it makes me fell even better to know that I didn't pay what a new one cost and I still get to enjoy it as if it was brand new."
1,Cardoza's 500 slots ...,"This product is worse than going to the real casino.It pays off a high percent of time at a rate of 2 for 3.Giving it a claim of a high percent of pays. I don't call 2 for 3 a pay. You very seldom get a serious pay-off from this product.It comes up a loss for me. There are more like 50 different slots than 500. You get the same slots over and over at a different play scale ( $1.00,$5.00,.25, .10, $1000), but the play scale does not influence the pay rate. You can play for hours and never get a win over 50 coins. Hours is an exageration because you run out of money (can borrow up to $4,000 at any one sitting)quickley no matter what denomination you use, .10, $1.00 it doesn't matter. Playing the max amount ( what else would you do)with returns of 2 for 3 or 3 for 5 is a bummer. I would not even try to re-sell my disk to an unsuspecting buyer it is so bad. If this is an example of Cardoza's products I can only say to the public ""Caveat Emptor""."
3,"OK, but No Cigar","I got this one looking for an improvement from the original. Why do I always do that? There are some new games, but mostly it's the same old stuff. The biggest kicker that sends this to the ""I'll play this game once a month"" pile is that none of these machines are authentic. There are 2 enjoyable bonus slots (Sweet Dreams, which I've never hit the bonus game yet, and Maze, which I have). There's also a bonus VP game called The Wheel Deal. They tried. I would recommend this to someone who hasn't gone to a casino yet, otherwise, it could be annoying."
4,video poker addict,"As far as the video poker portions are concerned, I am so addicted that I am buying the game for a relative. I have a huge bankroll and can easily make $1-2000 in a couple of hours! I love the games to the point I have to force myself to stop sometimes. I don't do as well with the slots but never did in Vegas either. I wish I could parlay my bankroll into real cash! There do seem to be some defects within the game program itself. For example, one night, whenever I got a full house, the game only recognized three of a kind. That only happened once though. Another time, the ""expert"" gave the same advice all evening as if he were on automatic pilot. Lastly, there is one game in particular that gives me an error message every other day and promptly kicks me out of the casino. If I open the game file again, I can avoid this problem by playing a different game for about five rounds. Otherwise, I LOVE this game and highly recommend it!"
2,Nothing like the real slots!,"The slots simulations on this package are pretty good for the way slot machines used to be. However, in the new century a different breed of slot machines has appeared at the casinos that leave these simulations by the wayside -- nickel slots are best at the casinos! If you have played the newer nickel machines, these will bore you to tears. If you haven't... try to get to a decent real-life casino soon. You won't regret it."
3,Not for beginners!,"I am a complete newbie to quilting...in fact, I haven't even made one yet. I read through this entire book and felt so overwhelmed and lost at the same time. I feel it is a bit over a newbie's head but probably excellent for a person who has quilted before. It has beautiful photos of various quilting patterns and is written in a very concise manner. I am only disappointed in the fact that I would consider a ""bible"" to be basic enough for anyone. I am going to purchase another book instead...called ""Quilts, quilts, quilts The complete Guide to Quiltmaking"" by Diana McClun. Everyone I know who quilts has recommended it to me."
3,Decent airport reading,"The exotic setting combined with the in-depth look at forensic procedure elevates what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill mystery to an ultimately absorbing read. Unfortunately the plot itself is overly simple, but I'd definitely read another book by this author."
4,Very Good Book for first-time foal handlers,"I thought this book was very good for the young, or novice foal owner/handler. I found that most of the information I already knew by learning the hard way i.e. trial and error. I have seen many intolerant/uneducated people handle foals rough so they should have read this book first before the foal was ever born. If they had they would be having a much more loving and harmoneous relationship with their foals, and also their grown horses."
4,The proof is in the results,"I used Dr. Miller's techniques from this book to imprint my first foal. He is a 4 year old stallion now and is docile as they come. He still thinks he's my baby. The second foal I had, by a different sire & dam, I didn't really imprint. Although he was born with a good temperament, he was so much behind and harder to train than the first had been. He's also a stud."
5,IT WORKS!!!,"I bought this book when my mare was five months preg. I read hundreds of times. When my foal came I did exactly what was in it, and my foal loads, ties, is good for the farrier, leads, ponies, EVERYTHING! One should not be without this book if they want a well-mannered baby."
5,Best Eye Stain Remover!,"We have a white jack russell, a corgi and two chihuahuas who benefit from this product, in particular our white dog. I've tried other products and the only one that clears their eyes for extended periods of time is this one."
2,Not that useful,I didn't really find that this helped with the stains around my dog's eyes. He still had them everyday even though I used this on him at least 3 times a day.
3,Not her best.,"I LOVED her first 3 CD's, however, I felt let down by this one. One of my favorite things about her music is her deep and thoughtful lyrics. However, I did not feel like I could relate well with most of the songs and they all sort of run together."
4,AWESOME!!!,"My teenage daughter and I had the privilege of seeing Nichole in concert a couple of years ago. It was just her and her piano - and it was the best performance I have ever seen! She was awesome; there are just no words to describe it.While her first CD is still my favorite (it just doesn't get any better than ""Who You Are""), Nichole's latest CD ""Brave"" is just as good as I expected it to be. There is a message and a lesson to be learned on each track.Even the Bob Dylan cover of ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" sounds brand new, especially to my daughter who plays that one over and over and over.Nichole rocks out more on this one, and there are a couple of tunes with a country flavor to them. If you don't cry after listening to ""Hold On"", then well, you're just not made of human parts. (-:I thank God every day for contemporary Christian artists like Nichole!"
4,good but not her best,"I liked this CD, especially the songs ""Brave"" and ""What If"", but somehow the lyrics aren't as poetic and woven together as her last two albums, at least I thought. Maybe she was just experimenting with this album, I don't know. Don't get me wrong - it's still good, but I like This Mystery and Woven & Spun better. I would suggest those."
5,Great CD!,"I read a lot of the reviews on this cd, and i didn't know what to expect. i saw some good reviews but i saw a lot of bad ones. i listened to all the samples but know if i would like it. i finally just bought the cd, and i loved it! this is so a cd to start you nichole n. collection with! don't listen to the bad reviews! this cd rules! here are my ratings:Brave 200/10What If 100/10Someday 10/10Real to Me 20/10Crimson 9/10- Made me cry!Hold on 9/10- Made me cry!Lay it Down 20/10No More Chains 8/10Gotta Serve Somebody 7/10Live 10/10We Build 8/10Overall- A perfect, well written, awesome cd! keep it up nichole nordeman!"
4,She has a awesome voice good cd Id say buy it,Im 46 yrs old This cd is someone someday soon will be a big star just wait & see. song 8 or close to end of cd was so so not as awesome as the rest of cd. but I thought rest of cd was awesome. George Bretzlaff im germ/ half irsh half french but was born in Indianapolis married 6 yrs to a awesome person.
3,Very low key album,"I am a big fan of Nichole Nordeman and have anticipated this album for a while now. It was ok. It was not as upbeat as her other albums. I didn't find as many songs on this album that moved me. From the liner notes it seems like this is an extremely personal album to her and the songs have very stong personal meaning to her. She is an incredible song writer but the songs on this album didn't give me goosebumps like some of the songs contained on her previous three albums. #5 - ""Crimson"" - is a good song. Very simple, few words but good. #9 I did not care for whatsoever.If you are thinking of buying a Nichole Nordeman album I would suggest starting with ""This Mystery."""
4,I thought the quality fit the price,"When you get 12 pupets for under $30, I don't think you can expect too much. My grand kids loved them and after 5 months still play with them. I'd love to find more of these types of puppets. The trims on the puppet outfits are pretty cheap, and there were imperfections in the painting of their faces, but nothing glaring, the kids didn't notice. i'd buy them again."
1,Weak format for a subject with a lot of detail,"Most textbooks will have the glossary terms on the sides of the pages for you to have the opportunity to read the definition there as well as within the text. This textbook doesn't do that. They have the whole glossary at the end but that's not real helpful at all for taking notes. The subject itself is confusing with multiple paradigms to approaching the same disorders and so many disorders within the field of Abnormal Psychology. Your not going to get around that but that's all the more reason to get a good textbook that presents the info as clearly as possible. This textbook goes over all the disorders towards the beggining then again later in greater detail, that was a real waste of time and paper. Some subjects in school can be boring and sometimes the teachers can make it more boring, well this subject has a lot of variety of info to learn and the authors make it harder than it has to be."
4,It Worked as Advertised,The construction on this product is very poor but it worked and was buried in snow for several weeks without a problem. I was worried about the thin gauge of the wire but my house didn't burn down so I guess it was OK. I am not excited about the quality of the workmanship but the product worked and didn't cause a problem so I had to give it four stars. I can't give it 5 stars because the poor construction made me nervous about it causing a fire the whole time it was in use.
3,One tough language,"The book was useful, but I had a hard time with the tape. I couldn't find any guide to what was on the tape, so I had to wander through the book to read what they were saying. It grew old quickly."
1,Buzz buzz buzz!,"This cord buzzed the minute I hooked it up to my amp. It wasn't terribly bothersome at first, and since I only intended to practice with it, I thought I could live with it. But within a week, it went from a low hum to a loud crackling static that was unbearable. I could hardly hear the guitar over the noise.I have since replaced the cord with a different brand and have had no issues. I won't be buying this product again."
3,buena imagen pero con problemas de encendido,"Compre este LCD hace un año aprox. todo comenzo muy bien hasta hace un mes que empezo a presentar un problema al encenderlo el cual se apaga y se prende continuamnente, pierde el sonido, ahora esta en el servico autorizado esperando respuesta y el costo de la reparacion"
1,Mine died :(,"I purchased this tv in Oct 2006 (not from Amazon) so it's currently 3 1/2 years old. As of today the picture no longer works and trust me, I've checked all the connections and all other ""duh!"" issues that I could, as did my husband. I liked it up until today but dh insisted from day one that the picture was not as good as the other brands that his friends have. This is now a discontinued model as per my recent internet search. If you're looking for longevity, choose another one. I'd hate to think that these newer televisions are only made to last a few years what with how much they cost!"
5,Great tv,"Nice TV, i dont have any complain. Great look and nice image. remote control a little bulky."
5,Excellent tv,"We're 100% pleased with this product and with Amazon's delivery. The tv was easy to set up. We do not have high def cable, but the picture is still sharp and clear. I would recommend this product.As to delivery - we were told the tv would be delivered between 8:00 am and noon. It arrived at 8:15. Can't beat that."
4,A great buy for an excellent HD set,I have this set attached to a cable box so can't comment on the tuner but it has a great picture and good sound quality. The cable company gave me an HDMI cable and it provides an excellent picture. I don't think you need one of those expensive cables to get all the set has to deliver. The set has three levels of brightness (the lowest setting is a power saving item) but looks best in high. The 4 star rating is based on the pictue quality of a 1080i system. Overall a very nice TV and well worth what I paid for it.
1,Picture Distortion,In the correct wide screen sizing of 16X9 the picture is very stretched to the point of being distorted. In a zoom picture size the picture appears more realistic but the tops of peoples heads are very often cut off. Do not buy this TV sight unseen as we did. Make sure you see it in person before wasting a thousand dollars.
1,WARNING!!!,"This TV is good in all ways but the ONE thing I bought it for: HD. I bought the $100 HDMI cable to get true HD and this TV does NOT support HDCP (Copy Protection) when I connect it to my HD-DVR cable from Time Warner in NYC. Before you buy this or any HDTV, check to make sure it does not block you from getting HD because of HDCP. It varies by specific TV model, and not by brand. One Samsung TV may allow, while another may block. This information is not readily available on the checklist of features that you use to comparison shop, so find that out BEFORE you buy and get stuck like I did. I would totally return this TV had I not already thrown away the box."
1,Extremely Unsatisfied,I ordered a TV that I never ended up receving due to a problem with the condition and not enough in stock. The only way I would have even knew that information was because I called up to find out. If I had not called then I would never have knew why besides the refund. Very dissatisfied with the service and communication provided by Amazon. I will never again go through Amazon. It is not worth the headache and I will just go into a store and pay a little more in the future.
1,Bad tv,"Tv is now in shop to fix a picture problem that appeared a few months after purchase. makes like an hour glass shape when showing picture. This was my first purchase, I also own a 40"" tv that didn't work out of the box. Maybe its bad luck. Similar to the Sonys I had which kept breaking down, but I still think the color on Sony is superior despite a short life."
3,OK but not great,"Out of the box the picture is way too dark. I mean really dark. I had to raise BOTH the brightness and contrast to get the picture to look right. It concerns me that a new TV out-of-the-box should require me to raise the brightness to nearly the maximum brightness. That's not enducing confidence in this TV for me.My 24inch Dell TV is great at the factory defaults -- with a screen perfectly bright set at the halfway point of brightness.The picture zoom feature is pretty dreadful. Most LCD TV's have an option to zoom a 4:3 picture but retain the original aspect ratio (makes the 4:3 picture bigger but with only a little stretching of the source image). With this TV, the zoom options cut off large portions of the edges of the video. I dont know any other TV manufacturer that makes zoom work like that. Makes no sense.Buyer beware on this Samsung model."
4,"Great show, recomend to anyone who likes Broadway!","I recently saw the show as a stroke of luck. To be honest I probally wouldn't have gone out and bought the tickets for myself. I loved it. I recomed it highly for those who don't like ""Broadway"". It is non traditional. A great show to take kids to see as their first show. Audience participation is encouraged and a great time is had by all!"
3,New Empire,"Very complicated and elaborate back story that I love in science fiction. I haven't read anymore of the series yet, but will. Right now I am checking out David Brin."
1,Boring,"I suffered through the first book in this series, hoping that Book 2 would be better. It is painfully boring. There is not a single space battle in either book, just people floating around in space guessing what might be happening on the various planets.Sula's character is completely unbelievable (the ""Sula"" that is pretending to be Sula). You get to learn very little about the alien species in these books. If you want a real space opera, read Saga of Seven Suns or the Night's Dawn. This book sucked so bad that I returned it and the rest of the series. Boring!"
4,The Life of Faustina Kowalska,The book is inspirational; however I think the author quotes too much from Sister Faustina's diary. I would like to know more about routine living in community as we read in the life of Padre Pio.
5,If you want to know more about St. Faustina....,"This biography of St. Faustina is very inspiring. I haven't finished reading it yet, but am very happy with what I have read so far. The message of the Divine Mercy is such an important one. I wish everyone could discover the blessing that the Lord sent through Faustina."
2,Timex Heavy Duty Timer,"Bad if used outdoor, this is the second one I purchased, lasted about 6 month. I had other one used inside which works good"
4,A good book for a learner of general practice,"As a learner of family medicine, you need something to back up what you are practising. You can't check up a thick book everytime in order to find out all of the differential diagnosis which you are going to exclude. This Companion Book is really the best companion for the medical student, trainee in the general practice setting, as well as those who want to really know about what Family Medicine differs with the hospital setting. It is light to take and you can just put it in your pocket. The font is easy to read. Although you may find the book is not containing everything that the thick brick like reference book contains, it is already essential and enough for you to give good care to the patients as a beginner."
4,NOT for English speakers learning Chinese!,"I took a chance and ordered this book, based on the brief description provided. It is a compact (measures 5.5 x 4 inches) reference, and may be wonderful, but it is not for novice Chinese learners like me, because it is ENTIRELY IN CHINESE! There is a single character index (ordered by alphabetized pinyin) with a numerical reference, then a Chengyu (4 character idiom) index. The body of the dictionary (again pinyin alphbetized) has the chengyu entry in Chinese, the four pinyin syllables, and the DEFINITION/EXPLANATION IN CHINESE.I tried this one after disappointment with another, Lin & LeonardDictionary of 1,000 Chinese Idioms. This one has explanation/definitions in English, but the Chinese is in script, in traditional characters, and the pinyin has no tone marks.So, the search for a Chengyu dictionary I can use continues."
3,The Storm,"Good description of what happened during Katrina and the causes of it. However, it is a first person narrative with a bit of self-congratulation embedded throughout (which is kind of annoying)."
5,Book review and Amazon Service,"The book (The Storm) is an excellent, well written and informative review of what went wrong in New Orleans following Katrina. Amazon's service in processing my order was excellent as usual!"
2,Tries but does not succeed much,"Lance Henriksen and Lauren Holly are mostly wasted in this thin story of a banshee whose head is brought into the 21st century by some unwitting researchers. The other actors are just okay, and it is hard to care much about anyone or anything in this film. The creature effects are also rather cheesy."
2,SCREAM IS MERELY A WHIMPER,I really enjoyed the previous entries in the AFTER DARK ORIGINALS so I'm a little disappointed in SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE. Production values are more direct-to-DVD level and the performances far below expectations. Maybe the SyFy channel is focusing more on quantity rather than quality.The premise of the Irish banshee folklore has possibilities but a poorly written script and weak performances result in a sloppy execution. Lauren Holly seems totally disinterested in her role as does the venerable Lance Henriksen who seems to do anything for a paycheck. The lesser known actors are just awful. There are a couple of jolts in the movie but nothing truly terrifying. Also the sound mixing is terrible. The sound effects blare out even making the banshee's scream more annoying than frightening and the dialogue obnoxiously soft. Keep your remote handy.Hopefully After Dark originals coming up (AREA 51 and THE TASK) are better than this misfire.
2,Screaming for it to end,I gave this movie two stars for the first 20 minutes. After that it seemed to me to become a mish-mosh into unoriginal horror fluff. Feh.
4,A Little Disappointed,"I ordered this CD just for Slaughter on Tenth Avenue, and honestly I was a little disappointed in this version. It seems to lack the drama, and I cant put my finger on it, maybe a little more bass, maybe more of a crescendo needed when the main theme kicks in, something. The tempo seemed wrong somehow. This song used to make me teary, but this version doesnt. This isnt the version played in the film ""On Your Toes"" is it? because it is definitely different."
2,Fuzzy photos,"I guess I'm not the fuzzy photo kind of guy. I know this was the in thing twenty years ago, but I prefer clearer pictures."
1,didn't last too long,"After 4 years of low mileage use of this pump, the bearing went out and all my coolant got dumped . Now I am back on Amazon shopping for a replacement from any company but this one."
4,Very impressive collection of maps and information!,"If you have every other book on Baja, you might as well add this to your collection. I found the information about areas of Baja which I have personally been to both accurate and interesting, which leads me to believe the best about the many other areas which I have not been to yet. The author has assembled an amazing collection of fishing information on the beaches and coastal waters which surround the Baja Peninsula. Baja is an amazing place and this book will provide you with useful new information for both the first time traveler and seasoned explorer alike!"
4,Excellent fights,Worth the price of admission to see Georges 'Rush' St. Pierre and Jason 'Mayhem' Miller go at it.

4,A comfortable comedy ...,"with two old friends.I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and of course their team efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious.Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots.Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director.Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive."
5,Priceless,This movie is fun for the whole family. I love it! This movie is worth watching over and over again. Lots of laughs.
5,Very Good Movie,OUT TO SEA is one of those special movies that comes along and almost goes un-noticed. It doesn't make a big splash but you go away feeling good. This is a really funny movie with a very good cast.
4,Out To Sea is boatloads of hillarious FUN!,"QUESTION: What happens when Grumpy Old Men meet The Love Boat? ANSWER: You get, Out To Sea! They're at it again, Lemmon and Matthau, creating that one of a kind ""odd couple chemistry"" that made them such a famous comedic duo in the first place! This time,they are posing as ""dance hosts"" aboard a luxury cruise liner. There's a few problems, though. First of all, Charley, (played by Walter Matthau), is REALLY in search of a babe with a big bank account, and Herb, (played by Jack Lemmon), does NOT know how to dance! although there are moments of extreme silliness, all in all, I thought this movie was a riot; packed full of funny, laugh-out-loud moments! In addition,Brent Spiner is an absolute scream as the sadistic cruise director! There are many other ""big"" names aboard the ship, also, and they all come together on the high seas to create a very entertaining film! A ""MUST"" for all Matthau and Lemmon fans!"
4,fun movie,I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. He was very excited to finally have this movie-he had a lot of trouble trying to find it.
4,TRULY THE OLD COUPLE,I TRULY ENJOY THIS MOVIE. I DID THINK WALTER MATTHAU WAS A LITTLE OLD FOR DYAN CANNON BUT JACK LEMMON WAS TERRIFIC WITH GLORIA DEHAVEN. THIS IS SUCH A FUND MOVIE--MATTHAU AND LEMMON ARE TRULY TERRIFIC TOGETHER.
4,Out To Sea,"Not quite the quality of ""Grumpy Old Men"" and ""Grumpier Old Men"" this Lemmon/Matthau film is still worth seeing. Elaine Stritch, Rue McClanahan, Donald O'Connor, Dyan Cannon, Hal Linden and Edward Mulhare are all great in their supporting roles. Try it---I think you'll enjoy it!"
2,"Two very funny men, an all-star cast. . .",". . .and a hideously weak plot.My wife and I are both fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau. Together, they have produced some hysterical films, most notably ""Grumpy Old Men"". This film, I'm sad to say, is merely a shadow of what it could have been.The basic plot -- an elderly (yet charming) con-man tricks his recently widowed brother-in-law into taking a cruise. Enormous humor could have been derived from this basic premise -- but unfortunately, enormous humor was NOT the result. The plot was shallow and predictable, and the humor muted. While there were a few points at which I laughed, it is certainly not the comedy classic ""Grumpy Old Men"" was.I can't imagine ever caring to see this film again."
3,OK,"This movie was okay, I enjoyed it, but I guess I was expecting something like grumpy old men and I was a little disappointed. There was not the same humor to this movie. How can you not like Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau."
2,Out to Sea,The DVD sent did not have a label on the disc. This is of a concern to me as someone may place the DVD in the player upside down. Wondering what happened to quality control
3,Average Movie - Great Cruise Director,"I don't really want to repeat what other reviewers have already stated. For a Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon pairing, I thought this movie was somewhat average. Nothing great. Seeing some of the older stars who haven't appeared in recent movies was a nice addition. I would still recommend their older movies over this one.However, Gil Godwyn was the one nice touch to the movie. Seeing Brent Spiner (Lt. Commander Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation) in this type of role was wonderful. My parents hated the movie but felt Spiner stole the show. I love to see performers play different types of roles, and I feel Spiner excelled here."
2,Eh.,"Don't waste your time. Boring, painfully slow, and only mildly funny. I feel sorry for good actors like Lemmon and Matthau for having been associated with this. Watch ""My Fellow Americans"" or ""Grumpy Old Men"" instead if you're looking for a funny ""cranky-old-men"" flick."
5,Fun movie!,"If you like the odd couple movies, you'll love this one too! We watched it on the way to going on a cruise. The characters are cute and the guy who play the Cruise Director was a stitch!"
3,EXCELLENT HUMOR JUST SOME BAD DIRECTIONS AT TIMES,good but not great. still reigns as a better film then grumpy old men anyday. give it a whirl. a lot of the film is quite funny. funnier then I ever thought it would be.
2,No pictures for parts and types of equipment,"Unfortunately, this book is a rare example of bad informative books I have recently bought. There is no picture when this book explains something. For example the book explains several parts of kayaks, but one cannot understand anything because there isn't any single picture that will point out parts of a kayak boat. This is the beginning, of course. Whenever the book starts to talk about a specific type of pedal, or another piece of gear, you are sure confused, because there is no picture.There is only one good about this book, which gives the names of good kayak books! So instead of buying this book, I advise everyone to buy other books concentrating on the subject matter with good explanations instead of a book of book names."
3,Two-Thirds Great,"When I heard the first four songs on this album, I was stunned.They were flat, lifeless, uninspired, cliched.This was a sore disappointment, because at their best (""The Last Bright Light""), Mostly Autumn is one of the best prog bands around.I almost didn't continue.Fortunately, I did.And I was rewarded. The last 7 songs are brilliant: varied, unpredictable, soaring, delicate, involving. Songs 5-11 get back to Mostly Autumn's great strength: a wonderful blend of Pink Floyd and Enya (or maybe Kate Bush).These songs are truly fine, and make the album worthwhile.But I wish they had junked the tired pop of the first 4 songs and waited for more inspiration before releasing the whole package."
5,Another Classic from this Amazing Band,"Storms is the Mostly's latest studio release and is perhaps there best work yet. However, if you are just getting in to this Band, I would recommend the 2CD anthology to start with to get the historical feel of the Band. Next I would buy The Story So Far live DVD and then the V Shows live DVD. By that time you will be permanently addicted to these guys. Now you are ready to buy Passengers and Storms and the rest of their back catalogue. I can't wait for their next CD scheduled for sometime in 2006. If you like intelligent prog and classic rock, like Floyd, Genesis, Tull, Deep Purple, Yes, Barclay James Harvest, Rennaisance, Caravan, Camel, etc., but are looking for something new, fresh, original and leading edge, then this Band is a must to try on."
1,Where is it????,Little hard to write a review of this product since I never received it. I have notified Amazon with no luck. Don't know what I have to do to either get my money back or get the product. Bad Customer service.
3,"Good, but Marsh has done better","I really enjoy Marsh's mysteries, and this one was no exception, in that there was a clever plot with a really devious method of committing murder. However, the characters in this book were not as compelling to me as ones from previous books (_When in Rome_, _Death in a White Tie_, etc.). Still, a very enjoyable read, and a great way to pass the time."
3,Not really happy,I got the piece as promised. I loved it's design and features. But just two week later the power supply broke down. Tech support got involve but not working. I couldn't install new power supply. Very difficult to remove & replace power supply in a tiny place. Until now I am still waiting for instruction to send the PC to HP for repair. Not really happy about this...
2,"Motherboard has known flaw, no video/boot",Motherboard has design flaw where the onboard NVIDIA graphics chip overheats and fails to function. The heat sink is only a passive design meaning there is no fan blowing over it.HP acknowledged the problem and extended the warranty 1 year past the end of the standard 1 year warranty. It was good till the end of 2009.[...]We bought this June 07 so we are out of luck as are you.
4,Still have not got use to Vista,This product has been good but because it uses the Vista format many of my previous software programs have not worked. This is the biggest drawback to this product.
1,Didn't work for me at all,"The best radio frequency was very fuzzy. I live in the Des Moines, IA metro area, so a decent size city but not too large. I would not take a chance unless you live in a very rural area somewhere."
2,so-so wouldnt buy it again,"my attenna is on the outside of the truck, so the only way to get a consistant signal was to stick the mp3s attenna magnet ON the trucks attenna.there is also a problem with the sound, it a prt of the song somes in strong (loud drums for instance) the mp3 transmitter muffles it"
4,"Small unit, works great - until it breaks","I wrote a 4 star review some time ago, however I'd demote it a couple of stars now. I've actually owned two of these and both broke in a short period of time. The internal wiring is very sensitive, and the case splits open easily. Both units lasted about 6-8 weeks. Walmart now sells a no-name unit for around $10 which is far superior to this."
1,Sorry I bought it.,"This device requires the use of an available FM band. None of the available bands was available in Denver, so it is completely worthless. It would make more sense to buy an mp3 radio for about $20 more."
2,No good here in the US,Didn't have the info I needed and was established based on codes in the UK. Didn't really help me here in Texas. It's like most college textbooks: a lot of filler and no real world application information.
4,A journey into time.....,"I bought this cd because I recognized it, I first saw it in the cd-collection of a friend, who is well-known for performing and recording this type of music. I collect also old recordings, and I think this is an excellent way of showing some of the past. Even more than only aria's and songs by one of them. It's like a journey into time."
2,"Good idea, but caveat emptor!","These do work great for organizing CDs and DVDs, and I do still use them, but I found that the two inside CDs/DVDs can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page. I kept my TV DVDs in these pages for awhile, and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge. A few of my Simpsons discs still won't play certain episodes. So I keep all the discs on the outside slots only, and I've never had another problem with them. I use the inside slots for liner notes/episode lists, though I usually have to trim them to make them fit right."
5,Excellent Movie! A must have for Historial Romance Lovers.,"I purchased this DVD after reviewing a few lists of historical romance movies posted on Amazon. This is an excellent movie, with the right amount of sexual tension and love. Don't be put off by the foreign writing on the cover, the movie is in english. I have watched it several times already, and it has become one of my favorites."
4,Dreams do come true in the FireLight,"I like this movie, the fantasy of an almost instant attraction and desire. Brought about by some internal need and goal they were depesrate to reach in their lives.The ability to maintain this dream over years and, even when denial is present, at the moment eyes meet again the attraction allows the fire to spark into a full recognizable flame.And the child that holds this dream work together is also the glue that brings the permanance of the bond to a head. Along with the history and the sexually charged attraction between the two from the beginning sets in place what cannot be denied.What woman wouldn't wish to be a part of this dream!"
4,I loved this movie!,"This is a very romantic movie. The uniting of Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane is magic. They are beautiful together. In the movie, Stephen Dillane's character wants to have an heir but his wife, who has been in a coma for years, decides to pay Sophie's character a fee to have his child. Their agreement is that he will take the child back to his home in England, and she will not ever see the child again. However, she eventually does, and it goes on from there. To me, this is a sweet and poignant film. And one of the best features of this movie is the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat. I had to buy it, when I bought the movie.For romantics, this is a one-der-ful film. I would also recommend, with Stephen Dillane, ""DeJaVu."""
5,Fantastic love story,This film kept me spellbound from the moment I started watching it right through to the end.Why Sophie Marceau has not been cast in many more films is beyond me.This should be an all time classic love story as I have seen none better.I still find it hard to believe that it hasn't been released on DVD.
5,Evokes the Victorian Era Beautifully. A Georgous Film to Watch. A Well Crafted Love Story.,"The story, acting, cinematography, music and recreation of Victorian era English manor life in 1838 combine to make Firelight an exquisite film. At its heart, Firelight is a love story, in fact, many love stories, but screenwriter and director William Nicholson (Gladiator) also manages to convey how limited the opportunities were for women of the Time. Even well educated woman had few opportunities rather than marry and become the property of their husbands. Fans of the the Romance genre, and Period pieces in general, will not be disappointed. Firelight didn't get the attention it deserved when it was released in 1998. If you are a Romance or Period piece enthusiast, or just enjoy a well told love story, do yourself a huge favor and purchase or rent the DVD. The 2004 release is in English and All Region DVD compatible (playable on any DVD player)."
5,very good film,"This has a little sadness, mystery and a very poignant ending. It is a beautiful story and the scenery and music is amazing. Highly recommend it."
3,Poor governess with a big secret,"OK movie ... Story of a governess with a painful, 8 year old secret ... in search to let it out and find calm"
2,Firelight-DVD,"As this is my favorite movie, I thought I would order it from Amazon to keep it forever. The ordering process was easy and efficient. I received the movie within two weeks of the date of ordering. I was surprised to see that the DVD cover was 90% in an Asian language. I was worried that the movie would be in another language other than English, but I was relieved to find that it was in English with subtitles that you could turn off. I do think that it should be clearly stated that this product was for the Asian market but it still could be viewed by someone who only understands English."
1,Bad DVD,I received a bad copy. The first part was excellent. The second part was very bad. I wasn't able to continue watching the DVD. The company promptly returned my refund. It's a beautiful and passionate love story. I've recently purchased another copy and I've viewed it many times.
4,"A daring ""costumer""!","Under the guise of ""an old-fashioned romance"", this incredibly beautiful film takes on some very controversial themes, including surrogate motherhood and euthanasia. It explores the theme of motherhood in a way no film has done before. Every word of the dialogue is freighted with meaning, much of which requires a second viewing to receive fully. Marceau and Dillane make an enthralling couple, and their chemistry is unmistakable."
5,Hooked on Firelight,"Did I like this Movie?????????????? Well I have only seen it 31-TIMES....and I'm not done yet, crazy huh. It's the best movie I have ever seen."
5,Firelight,I loved this film from the first time I saw it on Sky Box Office. The photography was excellent and the way the actors/actresses interacted was brilliant. Ever since then I have been trying to rent or nuy the video but with no success - is this ever going to be issued in the UK to buy.
4,Firelight still captivates,"I viewed this movie awhile back. I thought it was interesting then and I still do. At the heart of it, this is a story about a young woman who made a great sacrifice for the sake of family."
5,Love this movie!,"I decided to buy this movie for my collection after watching it the first time. What's a heart touching story! Love everything about it...music, characters, especially the story"
4,Firelight - Warm all over!,"The movie was brought to my attention by a man - yes a man. He told me I should watch the movie Firelight as it is the kind of love he was looking for in life. Well, I do not completely share his need for the dramatics afterall love is tough enough on it's own without having to add in a married man, a wife in a coma, and the pregnant governess that had your child. All in all it was a wonderful movie and I was delighted with it. It made me smile and I felt...happy when it was over. Yes yes yes...it is a sappy chick flick...I am surprised any guy would like it.....but then it also stars that gorgeous Sophie Marceau so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that a man liked the movie. I would definatley tell any woman that wanted to have an afternoon of girl movies that this is at the top!"
4,Good Movie,"I like old classic movies and I love a good romance. This was a simple movie with not a whole lot of plot twists, but the story in itself was a sweet one. How a couple, both in situations where they feel they have no other option, feel a connection they cant break away from."
5,Make your own decision,"Although I agree with all the reviews I have read that this is a great movie it does force you to deal with some issues that may make some uncomfortable. I'm not going to go over them as it would spoil the movie, but be prepared to really suspend belief or rather judgment. Every one of the actors & actresses in this move do a fantastic job of making this movie watchable, especially Ms Marceau who is both talented & beautiful. Her range is fairly broad considering the work she has done i.e. from Bond villanese to Shakespeare's Hypolitta & she certainly pulls this movie together by being a kind of Maypole that everyone else moves around. This movies also runs your emotions an Olympic mile, so this one isn't for the faint of heart."
5,It will take your breath away!!!!!,"From the beginning to the end there is not one thing I would change about this movie. It is absolutely perfect!!!! A definite ""MUST HAVE""!"
5,Beautiful,"Firelight is a film with beautiful cinematography. It is about a love story. It has all the right elements, with a gorgeous woman at the center of it all. Sophie Morceau is a young woman, who gets paid to have a nobleman's child. As soon as the coupling is brought to fruition, the child is taken away, with never seeing the child as part of the deal. But feelings outside the deal come into play, and she seeks them out years later, under the guise of a governess. It is the tale of a mother seeking a daughters love, and the unbidden love between a man and a woman."
3,Good movie for young martial arts students,My son loved this movie. It's an older release but in this day and age of everybody getting killed (ie lion king or toy soldiers) Good prevails without the usual gory scenes. My son is 4 and he really enjoyed it so much that he is now in a karate class of his own.
4,Sidekicks...,"I among others, enjoy this movie! Whenever I surf the cable channels, if ""Sidekicks"" is on, I stop and watch it! It's also good family fare for this day and age. I've been waiting for years now to get my copy on DVD, but, alas, a certain studio hasn't released it yet! Suppose that they are allergic to making money? Yeah, right! Fun and entertaining, 4 stars!"
1,O Stars more like...,"Oh dear, what a travesty. This movie is quite literally appalling, it gets my vote as one of the worst ""films"" of all time, although that may be crediting it with more significance than it is due; Cringe with embarassment as you try to sit through a ""heartwarming"" tale of a washed-up martial arts star, playing himself(yes, it's true) who comes to the rescue of an irritating little kid who's crying out for our sympathy and might get it if this film didn't resemble a TV movie reject. It would seem that upon receiving this script, Chuck Norris was badly in need of work and it was either this or tossing burgers. This film is full of cheesey sentiment, even cheesier fight sequences that would have Bruce Lee turning in his grave, appallingly staged attempts at humour and terrible acting by the entire cast. Don't watch this, you have so much to live for!"
5,"Eloquence, Elegance,, Evans........","I had never heard of Bill evans up until 2 years ago, it was then i heard Blue on Green by Miles Davis, i was perplexed by the piano playing on it, so since then my Evans collection has got to 18 albulms. New conversations is probably my own favourite. Song for Helen is played like it's Evans last ever song to the great producer Helen Keane. Then he slips in a more up tempo cheerfull number in Nobody else but me,probably the only uptempo song on the albulm. Then theres the beautiful rolling melodies of i love my wife. My own perssonal favourite is Remembering the rain,so elegent and emotional, it is pure piano melodies so gentle. This is a must for all those Evans fans who like his moody late night songs. This album is the greatest performed by the greatest."
1,Tom and Jerry!,Tom & Jerry have always been one of my favorite cartoons......... These make great Christmas gifts! It you enjoys cartoons yous should check this one out
2,good cartoon but false picture,"I want to begin by saying the video itself is very good! My son loves it and watches it often. However, as a consumer I was disappointed because when I purchased it I was under the assumption that it would have at least one cartoon on it related to the picture displayed on your website. The cover is shown with zoo animals. The dvd I received says volume one but has a completely different cover on it and no cartoons related to zoo animals. I think this should be looked into and corrected. I would not have purchased this particular dvd if I had known it would be different than what is displayed on the amazon website. This borders on false advertisement!!!"
1,"The ""NEW"" junk","Anyone who has anything good to say about the Tom & Jerry ""Tales"" series (all volumes) is great has not watched the original Tom and Jerry anmiations!This new animation is horrible. It has an odd jerky motion as compared to the smooth natural anmiation of the old cartoons.And to add insult to injury the screenplay and script is terrible. There is nothing to laugh about or funny about it.See the Tom and Jerry ""Spotlight Collection"" instead. That is what the real Tom and Jerry is."
1,Dissapointing,I thought I was ordering the classic Tom and Jerry episodes. Am returning for a refund. I dislike these new episodes. They are not near as clever and fun as the old ones.
3,OK but not the classic Tom & Jerry,"I bought this for my young son who loves to watch classic Tom and Jerry. I didn't realize it was a newer incarnation of the show. They are OK. Not as good as the classic Tom and Jerry but since only a limited number of classics are shown on TV and we've seen them all many times the novelty of the cartoons on this DVD made it worthwhile. But if you are looking for good old Tom and Jerry, this is not it."
3,dissapointed,"I am a 69 year old grandfather who is now introducing my 3 yr. old grandaughter to the cartoons I grew up with. I must say that my recent purchase of "" tom & Jerry tales"" leaves much to be desired. I can't put my finger on it, but there is something very lacking in the newer version of the cartoons as compared to the older ones. However having said that, She and I laugh our socks off watching the antics of those two adorable rascals. But i prefer the older versions better"
3,"Cute, but not very functional","The gym is cute to look at but not very sturdy. I never could get Tigger and lumpy to connect properly. It is also very small, so only really useful for the first couple of months for your baby. I got this when my son was four months and he was just about too big for it. The price is good, but I would have rather paid a bit more for a more sturdy and larger play gym."
2,Not impressed,"The animals are hard to shape into the form they need to be in to stand up properly, I could see this toy as being a safety problem. I would not recommend this item."
3,Great for the Price,"My daughter is only two months old, so she isn't quite old enough to really play with these things. She can reach out and grab or smack the toys, and when she is in a good mood will laugh at them, but it doesn't entertain her for long. I LOVE that they are plush and can be taken apart to use as stuffed toys as well. The toys don't make noise and are very simple, but the price was outstanding. I paid only 15 dollars on Amazon for this gym, while most others were upwards of 40 dollars!"
3,"Very cute,yet A bit disappointing,","It is a lot smaller than what I expected. My newborn fits on the Pooh blanket, but will soon outgrow the area and need a blanket ""back-up."" I can't get Tigger's tail and Heffalump's trunk to stand up like the picture either, it leans or the velcro comes unattached. You have to spot clean the Pooh blanket. My cats like to lay on it too, it would have been handy if it was machine washable!It is very cute and adorable as most Baby Pooh things are! The price was a value too."
1,terrible for independent study,"Though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology, it's the dryest, most aesthetically difficult to read textbook... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study. The publisher needs to redesign the book and/or you need to have a better online course professor. It feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material (which is interesting in itself) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction."
1,Save your money,"This movie is softcore and is unrated, I would have a hard time giving it an R rating. The acting is bad, the sex scenes are bad, the story is bad. I am trying to give my copy away but friends keep giving it back."
5,This hat is Flippin' Sweet!,"I absolutely LOVE this hat! You gotta love a hat that says ""Flippin' Sweet!"""
5,Clean ears,This is the only product I use to clean my dogs' ears. My vet recommended it. Now I have three dogs. It works great for the little one as well as for the big ones. It takes the smell away and stops them from scratching their ears. It is a great product for cleaning your dog's ears.
2,You win some and you loose some ....,"Actually I really like this author's erotica, generally, but every now and they he comes up with a real bummer. This is one.Sarah is a young beautifull hosewife married to the very successful, and very jealous, stockbroker Richard. Sarah may have the house, the clothes and all the becessities of life but what she does not have is the passion. Easily solved, the young gardener in a flash is on Sarah faster than stink on a donkey, and that is where the problem lays with this book. The gardener is hardly anything close to either a romanic, intelligent or erotic... he is what he is ... a gardener. Hey I might like real life erotica but you know this 'affair' between the gardner and our heroine is tawdry, and boring.Trust me the picture that the author paints in the eye of the reader is not pretty ..... Sorry Ray Gordon you only get 2 stars because I appreciated some of you other works certainly not for this bomb ....."
1,a white mans history of non whites,"This book was so obviously written at a time in the past when the only opinions that mattered were those of the white male elites of west european civilization. Would have been a great read if I live 110 years ago, now I'd have to say it is mostly just annoying - and I happen to be white"
4,The Grandest Of David Arnold,Absolutely brilliant! Completely original! But with flaws. Its missing more cues fromt the movie. Like the ending when they watch the burning space craft explode. Plus some major choral parts and music. But truely entertaining!
4,"Pretty good,but not perfect","This CD covers many styles,ominous,heroic,saddening,Etc. Arnold is brilliant with choir,horns,and strings.A great CD except for a few parts that remind the listener of some of the lame parts of the movie."
5,A great score...a great CD!!!,"This is one of the best movie scores I have ever heard. David Arnold has done a great job writing music to reflect this film's threatening aliens, its heroes, and it's great action scenes. The CD was also great. It was as long and epic as the movie itself. This score is one that belongs up there with other classic action-adventure scores like Star Wars and Indiana Jones."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Although I am not quite ready to board the ""David Arnold is the 21st century John Williams"" boat, I will admit this is a really good listening experience. I always thought the movie was fun, but I was always really interested in the soundtrack. And finally buying it was a great idea. Well worth the money. If you are partial to James Horner and John Williams scores, I can pretty safely recommend this score to you. I will be looking out for more of this fine film composer's scores."
5,Best Movie Score ever,IF we needed to play a song to explain the human will to survive it would be every song on this soundtrack. It is powerful and is better than the movie
2,Get Out The Sponge,"Every time I open a can the magnet on the can opener grabs the can lid and lifts it off so hard that food splatters on the counter. Whenever I want to use the can opener the first thing I grab is my sponge so that I can be ready to clean off the food from my counter.The can opener works but it is messy, it also is the noisiest can opener I've ever had and as stated in a previous review you have to really apply pressure to start the opener and you have to make sure the lever is aligned correctly, plus it doesn't work well on large cans."
1,piece of junk!,"could not puncture a can lid and when it did, it jammed. The lever did not press the button well enough to get the motor going consistently. its not worth the money."
1,Bad Choice,This is the worst can opener I ever purchased. I chose an inexpensive model and I received a poor product. Don't buy this. It takes 10 maybe more tries to open a can. My manual one quit so I kept on trying. Should have returned in during the warranty period.
1,The worst,"This is the most difficult electric can opener I've ever seen or used. It is soooo difficult to start it. The magnet works great, but the can opener doesn't start unless you try it like 10 times! Waste of money."
2,falls apart,"The magnet arm comes off. It opens great and is worth the hassle if you get it under $10. Still, wish for better at the same price."
1,You get what you pay for,"Used the product for about a month. I was deceived by the add thinking I was getting a knife sharpener with a electric grinding wheel like I had growing up on the back of the can opener. The one on this can opener is just a slide though, and doesn't work well. The unit is light weight and falls over easily with big cans. The blade and lid carrier falls off quite a bit. I didn't send it back because it was cheap and not worth the trouble. If your looking for a can opener and an electric knife sharpener keep looking, don't buy this one."
2,I love this can opener! Not so much anymore,"I love this can opener. I finally decided to stop spending only $10 on a no name cheap can opener from a retail store. I spent a little more here, not much a couple of dollars. It is worth it. I love this can opener. It opens everything so easily. It does peel the paper a little off the can, but not to where it makes a mess. The paper still stays intact on the can. I don't know about it being so tall, it looks average size. It also took a large can of tomatoes (28 oz) and opened it, no problem. My old one I used to have to hold up a can that big.UPDATE: January 30, 2010...OK, one year later. It never made it. It stopped working a few months ago. So annoying. Getting so tired of appliances never lasting. I'm changing my star rating from 5 to 2."
2,Warranty only 180 days,"Warranty only 180 days. Instructions state sharpener not to be used for serrated blades. Cutting is done not by a rotating wheel, but a flimsy blade. Construction isn't too bad considering the price. But not what I expected from from proctor/silex. Figure good for a year or two. Not worth problem of returning.Last P/S was from a garage sale for $2 & lasted for ages! Much different times."
2,got one a s a gift,"got one of these in white, as a hand me down gift/re-gift. it cuts cans of all sizes well-if you can get it to line-up correctly, and if the removable blade for easy cleaning doesn't keep falling out. i found it to be more of a hassle than it was worth and turned it in to my local thrift store as a donation."
4,Better than a handheld!,"I bought this product about 1 1/2 months ago, works fine, had a little trouble with it at first, but not since, great product!"
1,Junk,This opener is junk. It's cheaply made and it does not open cans very well. I ended up having to buy another opener after a few months. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointed,It is hard to get the cans situated correctly to be able to start opening them. If you can fit the can in correctly it will open fine but it seems to be very hard to get it started. Don't know why the cans don't just fit so they are easy to open as they always have been with other electric can openers I've had.
1,Never did like electric can openers,"And this one didn't change my opinion. It worked fine about 6 times, then died -- will no longer spin the can to open it. Back to the good ole' hand crank opener I guess."
1,Sent it back,"I canceled the order after reading some of the reviews, it didnt seem like a good one after i read about it."
3,CAN OPENER,"The quality is good, however, the placement of the can grab is so difficult, most times it takes three or more attempts to get it right. I would not recommend this item unless the can grab was improved."
1,Can't handle dog food cans!,"I had to return this item and went for a more expensive model like I should have done to begin with. This one did open small cat food or tuna cans, but when I tried to open big dog food cans it would do 1"" of opening and stall out, I'd try re-placing it and get another inch. It was NOT the can being dented, the machine is just wimpy. Cheap, yes, but in this case you do get what you pay for and this is an inadequate tool."
2,It doesn't cut well,"It is too hard to get to cut a can. Sometimes it cuts, sometimes it just pops off the can. The style is beautiful and fits in with my other kitchen appliances. Sure wish it would cut the can easier."
2,Cheap Can opener but works,"Not impressed with this can opener. I had the older version of this can opener and the magnet part broke off so I ordered the same one (or at least that is what I thought) to replace it. It was not the same style, this ""newer"" version seems cheaper made and it hard to use to open a can. It takes work to get the can just right and I had to readjust a couple of times to get it working again. I had bought this to use everyday since I have RA, but honestly this is more work that if I just use my hand held Kitchenaid can opener. Needless to say this went into my cubbard and will only come out when I can't use the handheld at all."
2,Not what I expected,Definately not what I expected. I expected recipes to help me make bbq sauces and to assist me in coming up with my own bbq sauce...but all I found was a list of the best bbq sauces around the US and their type of flavor.
2,Do not fall for this,If you think you are getting insight on ingredients or recep's you will be disappointed. It just gives a short story about the BBQ joint and the sauces served. 2 stars are being generous.
1,There's something about Susan Egan's voice that just keeps you listeneing!,"Something about her voice, it's like the perfect combonation of broadway/cabaret style, with a modern, sassy sound! I think part if it is her cool american accent!Love Susan Egan, love coffee house!"
1,Absolutely useless,"Absolutely useless, a bunch of generalizations deluded with pseudo-scientific diatribe.Tells you the most general (REALLY general) things about web engines. Things you probably know even before opening the book. Can be rightfully classified to fall into the category of ""Learn nuclear physics in 24 hours while chewing on potato chips..."""
3,good for just a starting point,Not bad for a general overview of the whole huge area. Getting alittle dated now. It gives a good background for knowing which way to go though the info is also available online with alittle searching (using the bots :)
5,Everything you need to know about Subversion,"This is an excellent Subversion resource. Everything from administration through use and automation is covered. In addition the author imparts some experience based wisdom about proper branching technique, which can be impenetrable at the best of times. There are some issues, the code is often a little long and sometimes acts as exposition. But for the moment I would rate this as the best Subversion book that I have seen."
4,average,"I found this book covered well the basics and introduced some good practices. However overall the book might have been better organized. For example you have to read the whole book to understand what best practices to adopt, before going back to the chapter on installation.The real case examples also lacked analysis.Finally, the book is getting a bit old since it covers SVN 1.1 and SVN is now at version 1.4, and there is no online follow up/errata page from PHPTR."
3,"A little disappointed, but maybe unfairly?","The CD came in great condition. I've bought things from this company before and been pleased. It seemed to take forever to get here, when I'd ordered other CDs from other vendors on the same day, and they had arrived two weeks prior. It's true, they came right within the dates they said they would, but nonetheless it took three weeks."
3,Chaka by Chaka Khan,Great album for it's time but I did not like it as much as I liked it back in the 80's - my music preferences are different now.
5,Loving My Chaka,"I have been a fan of Chaka's since High School and I have all her albums but you cannot play an album in a cd player! I still play her albums and their is not a scratch on any of them and have had them since High School! I have a few more of the cd's to get but this was one of my very favorites next to her ""Rags To Rufus"" album! I loved the price and the delivery was fast! Thank you for your professionalism and for getting my merchandise here without a scratch because of your packaging!"
4,Personal Transformation,"Mr. Sokoloff's ""Personal Transformation"" is a highly readable,brutally honest account of one man's journey toward complete deafness. What it does to him, how he deals with it and eventually how he triumphs over it's consequences makes for a very inspiring story that leaves anyone confronting adversity in their life with a tremendous sense of possibility. A beautiful story that could be so helpful to so many."
5,"personal transformation:executives experience of grief ,loss and renewal","I found the book emotional, stimulating and most of all inspirational.People who overcome difficulties and circumvent impediments embodie the american dream. Kiril is a model and spiritual example for us all as we navagate through our lives and the barracades we encounter.I have reccomeended the book to many and we all have reached similiar conclusions about the messages and joy the book provides."
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"I read the other reviews and thought this is a toy my 4 year old daughter would like. I was very dissappointed when I received it (the day of her birthday). There was NO headset Microphone, and no ""24 songs of music"". not to mention there is NO A/C adapter to plug it in (where do you buy that). I wrote amazon and they said they's send me a new one(since I received the wrong item). When I got the replacement it was the SAME one, no headset or music. Needless to say they both went back and she got something else. TOO bad because a Karaoke machine would of been fun. OH FORGOT to mention this item cost me $17.79 to ship (although after the trouble the first time I did get credit back).....so shipper beware."
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this toy. It would not work at all right out of the box, in spite of brand new batteries. It was a Christmas present for my daughter, and unfortunately I did not make sure it worked before Christmas. (Luckily her birthday was right around the corner and I had a beautiful toy put away for her so we were able to replace it quickly and save Christmas...)The manufacturer was no help at all. I really expected better quality. Very disappointed."
1,Look What They've Done to My Songs!,"Not a practical or readily workable gift for kids. A total bust. Poorly constructed; the play button rarely stays in place and the recordings, such as they are often skip. Even though it isn't terrific, at least young consumers should be able to play the darn thing. Instead, get CDs of the Beatles doing their own songs and some Beatle sing along books. Having a Beatle sing along has gotten positive feedback and is far more instructional - it's cultural sharing!"
2,Not worth it,"It's basically a tape player with a microphone. It comes with a couple of tapes. But it only held my child's interest for about an hour. She never touched it after that. If you are looking for an actual karaoke machine, then don't buy this."
2,Poorly designed toy,"My three year old daughter got this for Christmas last year and like many of the other parents have noted, the headset does not fit at all. My duaghter has to hold the mic piece of both the headset and the microphone right up to her mouth to even hear anything from the machine and then the sound is terrible and crackily! We have not even had the toy for a year yet, and the microphone input jack does not work any more so now it can only be used to play tapes. Which by the way, what child in this day and age actually know any of the songs included on the sing a long tapes that come with the toy? You're better off spending a little extra and buying a real karaoke machine and then you can choose what tapes or cd's to buy and your child will actually sound decent when using the mic!"
3,Fun for a while...,This toy was fun for while. My aunt got it for me when I was like 7 or so. I loved it when I got it but it broke after a while. I was so sad when it broke so my mom returned it and got another one to replace it. I played with it for about a year and almost all the tapes are lost now. Just to warn you the sound isn't very good and the headset does not fit me at all. But maybe it's because I am to big for because I'm 10 now. Overall it's still an ok toy.
3,"It's OK, but not expandable...","I gave this item as a gift for my 9-yr old niece, and on the whole, it's not all that bad. BUT, you can only use the crummy CD's that they include with the toy, and that's about it. If someone is a Barbie freak, they'll probably like it. For about a week. And then it will end up in the junk pile with all the other toys they get sick of...ONE CAVEAT is that they include a microphone and a headset, so the fighting over the toy is minimal. Unless you have more than two nieces..."
1,One of the worst!,"My brother gave us this toy for us four years ago. It didn't work out the way we wanted it to. No one really played with it. I had to agree that the singers just sounded miserable. One day, this darn thing didn't even have the singers! Now I'm trying to get rid of the Castlespring Diva Dance Studio karaoke machine! Each time it plays, it skips! I don't reccomend purchasing this or the Castlespring thing! They are the worst!"
3,Higher volume capability,"I purchased this toy for my 7 year old daughter, it was on her christmas wish list. However I am disapointed in the quality of the tape that come with the machine, they are not clear/loud enough. Also the manufacture should include some songs by african-american artist."
2,Karoake Machine for Niece,"My niece loves to sing in a microphone, but the tape that came along with it is completely blank! There are no songs on it. It's supposed to be a ""Sing With Me Barbie"" karoake tape. How can I get another tape?"
2,"Great idea, bad manufacturing!","My 7 and 8 year old loved this toy a lot last year, but it only lasted a couple months. Both microphones went out immediately and the headset didn't fit. We go them the Bratz karaoke machine to replace. More expensive, but it lasts. :)"
1,Very poor quality - - don't waste your money!,"Our 3 year old daughter received this karaoke machine as a birthday present, however we soon realized that it's worth about a third of what we paid for it. The knobs on the machine don't function properly. We can barely hear the voice over the music. There are no tunes for younger children on any of the tapes provided. The headset is one of the poorest designed we have ever seen. We took it back immediately, paid a few dollars more, and got a Singing Machine--- a much better product."
1,Piece of crap,The headset does not fit right. i had 2 put it on upsidedown then i got it. then it makes your voice sound way different then it really does. this toy is not made 4 a 3 yr old! like a 3 year old can really read the words?
1,ZERO Stars!,"This toy was a gift to our 4 year old daughter and if you are considering giving it as a gift keep in mind that the music is terrible and most people don't want their children even knowing that this music exists let alone singing it at home. Yes, there are some old classics but the vocals and music are terrible. Are daughter liked it but PLEASE as parents I don't think we have to give them everything they want! Isn't that our job. Ours is now ""broken."" And, we play music in our house but music by TALENTED, original artists."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter for christmas. It says it is for 3 years and up. Our 4 year old is quite advanced for her age so I though she would have no problem using it. The songs on tape that come with it are for much older kids. Some of the songs I have never even heard of. She isn't old enough to read so she can't read the words off the printed pages so she can't learn the words to the songs. It is very difficult to hear the music even with the volume all of the way up. She mostly just uses the blank tape to tape herself singing ""twinkle twinkle"" and ""Itsy bitsy spider"". The head set microphone that comes with it is difficult to use as it doesn't fit the four year olds head nor does it fit my head. Not worth the money in my opinion."
1,poor quality,"The tapes that come with Karakoke machine are of a very poor quality. It is difficult to hear the words or the music while you are singing into the microphone. After using it for only 4 days, the machine quit putting out any sound even though all of the other functions seemed to be working. I would not recommend this toy."
2,The Barbie Karaoke Tpe Player,My husband bought this toy for my daughter. We had a problem with it as both microphones did not work so we were not too happy about that. Basically our daughter is using it to play her tapes.
1,not happy,"terrible sound, doesn't come with a/c power, headphone mike doesn't stay on, daughter ended up cutting wires off and using mikes as pretend instead."
3,OK toy....,"My little sister got this for christmas yesterday, so i do not yet know of the durability. she seems to have fun with it, but i find it quite annoying. the tapes have real songs, like Bye Bye Bye and Sometimes, etc, but do not have the real singers singing them. this upseted my sister very much. also, when you sing with the microphone or headset, you can not hear the words of the song very well. most people would think of this as a good quality, so that you can just hear yourself singing, but little kids most likely do not know the words exactly, so would like to be able to hear the singer. at least, that is how my sister is. another bad thing is that the headset does not like to stay on. also, the recording feature is absolutely horrible. also, this toy has no educational purposes at all! all in all, this is just an ok toy...i do not belive this toy is worth the price at all..."
3,kinda disapointed,i was hoping for a lot better reception than it is giving me. it is so frustrating when i have to get it in just the right position to get a good reception.
2,Good night picture but monitor breaks easily,"Fuzzy reception, but night vision is better than another system I bought after the monitor jack broke. Regarding that power jack... it'll break very quickly depending on how often you plug and unplug it (or stress the plug when its in). I've had to open it and solder back down 3x. Batteries don't last long so you have to use the plug!If you buy one, just keep it one place. Otherwise, I guarantee you the power jack will break within a few months."
1,Don't buy!,"We thought that this monitor was going to be great. The reception is awful (needs to be in the exact right position) and has a faulty cord. It would be great if it worked, but half of the time, the screen is dark!"
4,"Good if you stay in La Selva, Costa Rica",Nice compact book. The only trouble is that it is so specific to one little area that it misses species that may be just down the road or just less common in this area. Nice for a quick reference for common species but not as extensive as I would like. The keys are useful. It is not always easy finding a field guide with good keys!
1,Junky telescope,"We weren't expecting much from this telescope. It WAS for a 3-year-old, after all. But it's really cheaply built and the turning mechanism has a really loose, almost jiggly feel to it. Wish we had just gone with a SUPER cheap one now."
2,Does Not Live Up To The Hype,"I found this product to be easy to install, but clumsy to use do to the continued reliance on both the CD and a set of applications installed by the product on my PC. I also found it to have limited applicability to my needs - it turned out to be oriented more toward basic conversational Dutch (the kind you might use standing outside a coffee shop in Amsterdam) rather than the words and phrasings that would be commonly found in business communications (which is what I was looking for). Perhaps this comes up in later Levels of the product, but given the price I paid for Level 1 Dutch, I'm not throwing good money after bad to find out."
5,Review: Strategy,Really book for game theory and contract theory. The author does a really good job of explaining the theory with examples that are easy to understand.
5,deja vue,"Listening to this Big Bamboo again after three+ decades brought back all the memories of the Cheech and Chong era and the good times I had. I had lent it to someone and never heard it again all of these years and it's still funny, especially without the scratches. If you were a fan get this CD and enjoy!"
1,Disapointing,"The actual condition of the product was fine. The content was very disapointing, as in, not funny.I guess, at the time, this was considered ""racey"" but it didn't do much for me. Sorry."
1,how far can you go on balls alone?,"Pretty far, actually. ""Nobody ever lost money underestimating the public's taste."" Or some such. My ex-wife liked Cheech and Chong. Pity I didn't know enough at the time to recognize that red flag and call our engagement off. I first heard these guys after listening to Firesign Theatre for a couple years. Quite a shocking transition, from caviar to dog waste."
4,good memory's from a long time ago,My older sister had the albumn when we were kids. For years I always remembered a couple of the skits and would quote from the albumn but nobody knew what I was talking about. Now I can play it for them. Brigings back good memory's of childhood.
5,Great Resource,A great resource for classrooms! Studying word origins can be amazingly fun! This book is the perfect resource!
4,Handy for mixed media artists!,This is a great book for printmakers or visual artists using heavy paper stock or mixed media. The coptic stitch diagrams are off-putting at a glance but as always Smith has simpler options that give you the confidence to try harder bindings. If I could only afford two of Smiths books this would be one of them. The other would be Volume 1 Non-Adhesive binding Books without Glue or Paste. If I could only afford one book then I'd borrow the money for the second!
4,A great addition to your Canadian Brass collection,"This is one of my favorite Canadian Brass CDs. If you enjoy Bernstein's Candide and West Side Story, you'll find a fresh take on many of the most memorable tracks. My personal favorite on this CD is 'Make Our Garden Grow.' The soaring trumpeters always give me chills, and the climax is massive! Also, the final track on this CD gives you a chance to hear the VOICES of the Canadian Brass performers in a comical version of 'Gee, Officer Krumpke.' Overall, this CD has wide range of styles and definitely shows that the Canadian Brass is not just a group of stuffy musicians!"
4,"A Beat for Work, A Beat for Play!","""The Canadian Brass Plays Bernstein"" provides enjoyable listening for a wide range of listeners. Instrumental until the last piece, this CD makes pleasant background music for one working or reading. The lively beat and familiar tunes hold the interest of the listener who is ready for a more intense involvement in the music. All in all, this was a worthwhile purchase."
5,thank you,"thank you, I bought this as a christmas gift for a friend and it came with more then enough time for me to give it to him."
4,nostalgic,Listening to this cd brings back memories of those days in the 70s when Cheech and Chong were heard all over the place. Love to listen to this and laugh.
3,"Great Material, but Poor Recording Quality","Classic Cheech&Chong;, but the recording quality was horrible.One minute I would have to have the volume full blast just to make out the words, and then suddenly I would have to drop the volume drastically to keep from being blown away. Sadly this went back and forth throughout much of the album."
5,"This is so funny, i have this on record too!",I've got this one on both cd and record. and no I'm not old I'm 14. I think everyone that likes cheech and chong will really like this one. just plain funny.....
1,Save your money,"I am a graphc design major and I had to buy this book a couple of years ago for the class. The book was never used or discussed in class. The book has nothing to do with the mechanics, software or production of art work or graphics. It's all about ideas or maybe how graphic designers and artist think. Maybe the instructor was getting a kick back or royalites from the sale of the book, I don't know, but I could have saved my money. The fact that I purchased the book in 2007 and I'm the second person to write a review - EVER, that's very telling."
1,Indescribably bad,"Perhaps the best things to be said about this debacle are that the orchestration recaptures the sound of the premiere production (unlike the tinny little band in the '95 Roundabout recording) and that Harry is an exceptionally strong vocal presence. The ""Noo Yawk"" accents are crassly overdone and Sheila Gish's tremulous, overinflected Joanne is like someone's notion of an Elaine Strich parody. Worst of all is Adrian Lester, the world's dullest actor and an inexplicable choice for Bobby. His thin, whiny non-voice is like fingernails on chalkboard and sinks this recording single-handed. Only for Sondheim completists and incurable masochists."
3,nice reminder of what you know,It never hurts to remind yourself and that is what this little gem does in a pleasant way. Give it as a gift!
4,Nice little practice book,"This book is nothing special, just a bunch of very simple crossword puzzles. The first half have English clues, and the second have French clues. I don't know how educational it is, it's just some easy practice for a beginner of French, maybe someone who has done one semester of a college course.The book is so cheap though that it's a good purchase. Maybe the larger and more popular books are better, but they often run as high as $20. At least you know that you'll get your money's worth with this one!"
3,What?,The previous commenter: Your stupid Pimsleur does not even have a Turkish program. Wake up before dropping a line!!!
5,Faceless doesn't mean empty,Brilliant show!! Incredible music. This is one of my favorite Cirque shows and CDs. I have seen this show 8 times so I am quite familiar with the music. I also have a friend that was in the show so that's why I had the oppurtunity to see it so many times. You will love this album.
4,Good Album but could use more music,"This is a very good album but it is missing some of the best music from the show including Banquine, Handbalancing and Spanish Webs. Though if you want Banquine it is on the Journey of Man Soundtrack. I highly recommend this for any Cirque fan."
5,"Emotional, mystical, revitalizing and awe-inspiring!",Quidam was my 1st exposure to Cirque Du Soleil and I smile whenever I think of it 2-years later. The mystique can be visualized through the music even if the listener has never been privileged to witness firsthand. The visual images are a unique bonus! My first CD disappeared and I'm thrilled to be able to replace it.
3,Maybe Next Time,"Having long been a fan of Cirque du Soleil, I purchased this cd with high expectations. Sadly, I was dissappointed. I bought this cd after seeing the live show. However, many of my favorite acts(Hand Balancing, Spanish Web, and Banquine)aren't even on the cd. The cd is very short(about 46 min) and the songs that are on the cd are edited strangely. The tune from the German Wheel vaguely resembles the song I heard during the live performance. The addition of an acoustic guitar into several songs changes the whole tone af several pieces(Incantation-German Wheel and Zydeko-Skipping Ropes). Over all, I feel like the cd I bought is for a different show. If you collect Cirque du Soleil music, buy it to fill your collection, otherwise you might want to let this one pass by. I appreciate the effort by Cirque, to make a cd, but too many little shortcomings made this disc a disappointing buy."
4,Enchanting but Strange,"Quidam is an excellent CD especially with it's enhanced graphics and eerie music, but it could still use some work. There are missing pieces to the whole show and some of the songs get a bit long and repetitious, such as Steel Dream and Incantation-especially if you havn't seen the actual acts that go with.On the other hand I love Zydeko! It is the perfect circus music for fun and very catching! Why didn't they make it longer than 1 minute and 17 seconds? It's to short to make up for the rest of the overly long, repetitious music on the CD.Seisouso and Let Me Fall are both beautiful pieces but there is a lot of melancholy in them and Atmadja is to much 'New Age' for me.The closing song, Quidam is fine but once again-to long! However it does bring back memories of the happy ending to the show and sparks the imagination.Altogether, not a bad CD but it gets old after the third time around!"
3,Not like I thought...,"I was very dissapointed in this CD. Unlike the fabulous performance of Quidam by Cirque Du Soleil with increadable it's music, this track has very few of the original songs. The music on the CD is fine and rather enchanting, yet it dos'nt really capture the mystifying show. I am a large Cirque Du Soleil fan, and Quidam is my favorite of their productions. When I bought the CD, however, I expected more of the actual music, rather than altered variations."
3,SpongeBob Candle,"Bought this candle on Amazon becasue I couldnt find it anywhere eles. Nothing huge about it just a candle, its a little on the small side thou but it will do."
1,Settles in all the lines,"After reading the positive reviews, particularly from the makeup artist, I decided to order the Secret Brightening Powder. I should know better, but this POWDER sounded different than any other. Well, I got it home, and patted it on, just a tiny bit; INSTANT WRINKLES!! I looked 10 years older. The first ingredient is Talc, so there you go. I don't know how it is possible that other women with lines under their eyes do not have this product settle in them. I am so disappointed, now I have to return the powder, wasting more time and money."
2,brightens yes but accentuates fine lines too,"I have used this brightening powder for at least a year and began to see its flaws over time. Yes it does lighten dark circles under the eyes since the powder is very white, (apply it over your concealer) which was really great at the start, but i then realized that it also accentuates fine lines under the eyes as well, making them more pronounced than had i gone without it. So as much as i still have a jar and a half left, i havent touched it or used it in over a year. I'd rather just use my concealer and go without this powder (since we all use concealers anyway which can be enough) than have my eyes looking old and lined and wrinkled underneath."
4,Concealer setting powder,"This is a great product. It sets my concealer so it lasts all day. I typically never touch up makeup and with this, no need to. My biggest beef is the shipping! I bought three items and had to pay $5.95 each for three very small items!!! I will never buy this brand again for that reason. And this was after I asked if they would combine the packages."
2,No noticeable difference,"I had high hopes for this product, but I really didn't see any difference when I put it on. I have dark circles, and this didn't do any brightening at all. It really seemed more like any regular translucent powder. I guess I was expecting some sort of shimmer or something. I don't really have any lines yet, so I can't comment on it settling there. Honestly, I ended up using it as an all-over face powder once my regular powder ran out, just so I could use it up. I wanted to love it, but it just didn't do anything special for me."
5,Fantastic!,"Correctly applied--""Genius""- the Beethoven of our time- Leonardo Balada's Piano COncerto #3 is bold and fresh. The orchestra is a paintbrush in the hand of this master. The piano writing is unique-- there will be no mistaking this Piano Concerto for any other.Fantastico!"
2,too shtickey,"Sorry, just kind of fluffy and puffy, with no real soul.You too can be modern if you use a Debussian scale."
5,Outstanding read.,This is one of the best books I've read in years. I lived it from the first page to the last and will never forget it.
3,"Great DVD, but...","This DVD is WELL worth the money you will spend on it. It is CHOCK full of things, from all the music videos up until Love Metal, and a [..] load of live performances. Plus, in the extras, there are many MORE live performances, interviews, biographies, etc. Definately worth the money.BUT... don't buy it if you only have 1 DVD player in the house. Because this DVD is weird and screws up on some DVD players. The video gets choppy and it looks like it's skipping. Be careful when you buy this. Though it is well worth your money, keep in mind it may not work right."
3,Not very good.,"The instructions are pathetic. The bank/ATM seems to have a mind of its own, automatically switching modes.Younger kids will be fascinated because they give plastic playing cards, Barbie Bills and Coins, and it talks. This product needs some refinement."
5,I loved this book!,"I loved this book.Jeanette Eyerly is a very execlent author!This book is about a 16-year-old girl named Ellen who has the perfect life.Then her parents get divorced and she has to move and go to a new school,make new friends and everything.Nobody at her new school knows about her parent's divorce.Her father is never around because he is going to marry his secretary.Then her school has a party for fathers and daughters and Ellen's father can't make it,and Ellen is afraid to tell her new best friend because her friend has the perfect life and Ellen is afriad of what she will think if she told her her father is really not around as much as Ellen says he is.Its a very good book.I highly recommend any book by Jeanette Eyerly!"
1,No thank You,"Wow. 1 good movie, 1ok movie, 1 meh movie, and one movie so bad Oliver Stone should have to personally apologize to anyone who's ever seen it. Save your money for something more enjoyable, like a root canal."
1,Buyer beware--disc is LOADED with edits!!!!,"If you like all the Cranberries radio hits, and were hoping to have them all on one disc instead of owning every single Cranberries CD, just be warned that you are NOT getting many of the full length recordings, with some tracks being as much as 2 minutes shorter than the original album versions. Amongst the many edited versions I noticed were:DreamsWhen You're GoneFree to DecideHollywoodPromisesAnimal InstinctJust my ImaginationYou & MeTrack times:1. dreams (4:15)2. linger (4:34)3. zombie (5:07)4. ode to my family (4:31)5. i can't be without you (3:07)6. ridiculous thoughts (3:36)7. salvation (2:24)8. free to decide (3:23)9. when you're gone (3:52)10. hollywood (4:19)11. promises (3:32)12. animal instinct (3:32)13. just my imagination (3:13)14. you & me (3:17)15. analyse (4:06)16. time is ticking out (3:01)17. this is the day (4:15)18. daffodil lament (6:06)19. new new york (4:09)20. stars (3:31)"
2,NOT THE BEST CRANBERRIES,"I bought this best-of cd wanting to hear a band I liked and saw a few times back in college. The problem is, Amazon doesn't let you know that the songs are the ""singles"" versions that were shortened for radio. ""Promises"" is hacked down to practically nothing. I'd recommend just buying their original cd's as opposed to this."
4,Good :),"This is an awesome cd..its not the original, though because one of my friends has a cd like this one and the songs have the longer and better introductions..."
5,Christmas Gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I am sure it will be enjoyed and appreciated.Thank you very much.
4,"Lucky ""Stars"".","This hits collection is just about as good as it could be. I would have liked to have a few more moody songs like ""I Still Do"" or ""Dreaming my Dreams"", but at 20 tracks, it's hard to complain. ""Shattered"" and ""Dying Inside"" would have been good too. But this has definitely got the pop hits covered. ""Dreams"", ""Zombie"", ""Free to Decide"", and ""Animal Instinct"" are all here. The two new songs are good as well. If you're someone looking for your first, or only ""Cranberries"" cd, ""Stars"" is the one to get. It will go great with your ""Sinead O'Connor"" and ""U2"" best of's."
4,Incomplete for Cranberries Fans,"Besides the songs being shorter, for people who like the Cranberries rather than just like a couple Cranberries songs, I feel a compilation is not the best way to go. For myself, of my top 20 Cranberries songs, only 6 appear on this compilation. I don't fault the people who put the CD together. I just think it's tougher to categorize Cranberries songs compared to songs from other groups. The individual CDs contain so many secret gems. And while my gems will be different than yours, it's almost certain that if you like most of the songs on this compilation, you'll find even more you like that aren't contained in this shortened list."
5,The best has finally come!!!!!,"This is the best cd. All of the number one singles are on it, and it puts the greatest songs together so beautifully that no one could have asked for a better greatest hits CD!!NEW NEW YORK is totally inspirtional and features some crazy(meaning excellent) vocals by Dolores and Stars is simply the cutest song i HAVE ever heard!!! Her voice truly comes out, and you know what, if ur a CRANBERRY FAN, GET UP AND BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!! ITS THE PERFECT COMPELATION OF THE BEST SONGS!!!!!!!!!!!! HAVE FUN :)"
5,VERY IMPORTANT INFO......,"Hello, if you have gotten this far then you should know a thing or two about the Cranberries. I have never heard a group that sounds sooooo good together. And NEVER have I or will I hear a voice as beautifuil as Deloris O. She is the epitomy of a goddess. DELORIS please dont EVER stop singing, I listen to your albums DAILY. You are what keeps me going. Thanks you and love you SHANE LUCAS, COLUMBUS,OHIO"
5,The Cranberries' Greatest Hits,"This is such a great compilation. Honestly, I don't know what to say about it. I love it though. My favorite songs (and the songs I recommend that you listen to) are: ""Linger"", ""Zombie"", ""Does Anyone Care"" and ""Dreams"". It's really great."
3,Cranberries Are From America Not Ireland,"But I guess they must have Ocean Spray over there. The earlier work is nice to hear because the chick singer sounds more like a woman than an Irish female version of W.C. Fields. ""Dreams"" is an almost perfect song. It could have used some fine tuning in the lyrics department... and there is one really stupid echoed lyric where she sings ""You're a dream to me."" Instead of leaving it alone or using reverb she sings ""Dream to me"" again and it messes with the continuity of the song. If it wasn't for that they have achieved pop perfection."
1,Cranberry sauce leaves sour taste,"90s alternative rock at its worst (aside from Smashing Pumpkins, that is). That Irish-accented woman singer in this group is annoying as hell. There's one song where she goes ""ah ah ah ah"" for about 45 seconds. What is that? Imitation Yoko Ono? How can anybody call this good? The band is OK, but once she starts her carterwalling, forget it. ""Crapberries"" is more like it."
2,Hindi made difficult,I first learned the basics of the Hindi language fourty years ago. I thought this version would help deepen my understanding of the language. I found the pictures were western and the script was Devangari instead of western script. That made it difficult since I have really never learned the Devangari script and wanted to brush up on the language and do it quickly. I also found the level of the program was too simple. It did the present tense but nothing else. I needed to brush up on all tenses and this program was not for me.
5,Awesome,"I can't believe I'm understanding Hindi sentences! I am amazed everyday when I look at the length of these sentences and know that I understand it. And I'm only on Unit 1, lesson 10 I really hope they come out with a level two."
2,somewhat useful,"This method is not the best for me for language learning. I think it's too indirect,inefficient and not completely clear. I would not buy another program."
1,Absurd approach for a beginner,"This software uses an absurd approach. They play a long sentence for you and then don't give you the phonetic pronunciation in English in writing. Instead they give you the pronunciation in devanigri (Hindi) script. This is completely useless for someone who can't read Hindi. And they don't teach you the script either.Completely useless approach and frustrating for a newcomer. The Japanese version of Rosetta stone had English phonetics with the Japanese audio, and that was ten years ago. I don't know why they didn't stick with that approach for Hindi. The only think I can think of is that they messed up when producing this software and were too cheap to correct the problem.I also own Japanese, Mandarin, and Spanish versions of Rosetta Stone, but I'm about to switch to Total Immersion for my fiance because I've had enough of this crap frustrating her."
5,Finally One For the Kids and Me,"I have bought many products from the Math Tutor for the Mrs., as she often has to teach herself advanced mathematical concepts at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She always understands better and makes straight A's when she applies herself after using these programs for supplement and/or self-teaching. I bought a book on mental math, and it made several things easier for me. This program just added to it, and it makes it easier for the kids as well. I highly recommend this and all the other programs I have bought from the Math Tutor, and I hope he'll have more of the ones I'll want in the future."
3,There is a better compilation,"This one isn't bad, but buy ""Essential MSG"" instead and get more for your money"
4,Poignant and Provocative,"The Dazzle of the Light is a poignant and provocative tale of one man's journey after the death of his older brother. The main character refuses to accept the platitudes of others and wants to face his grief head on. The book reminds me of early Hermann Hesse, a bildungsroman in which we follow the progress of one character over the course of the novel. Lyrical, funny, bittersweet, eventually uplifting. The Dazzle of the Light is a great read."
5,michael monarch mm3,this cd is a musical masterpiece. it blends music with a latin touch to a knee slapping country jam. i personally love malibu sunset which i can sit back close my eyes and feel like i am there with the music. cubana and amor or less which have a latin vibe to them really hit their notes. this is a great album to have and i love the whole album. the slide work on the cd ( hot night in dixie and slide on over )is incredible. it shows the the true talent that has been put into these tracks.
3,cult of sound,"a good, but probably not essential entry in the Earth catalogue. nonetheless, a pretty great cd and a good chance to hear their beginnings. ""Ouroboros Is Broken"" is the standout cut here. a lumbering rumble of a good time."
3,....?.....,"Different only begins to label Earth. This three song cd is one of the most undescribable, weird, drugged out, and ultimately ambiently confusing I have ever listened to in my entire existence. If only I knew what this meant, where the inspiration came from, or where in God's name Carlson came up with the ideas I'd be satisfied. I find this cd to be extremely hard to get into due to the fact I can't seem to be absorbed into the world of Earth. Only then can the music truly take shape amongst the listener."
3,Amazon dropped the ball,"I ordered a CMT keyhole router bit from Amazon. Received it fine. Went to use it,it was almost impossible to remove from the case. The only thing to grab onto is some very sharp cutting edges and either the hole was too small for the shank or vice versa. Once I had it out of the case, it did exactly what it was suppose to do. Put it away. A few days later, went to use it again. This time, in the process of removing it from the case, the cutting head broke off of the shank. Called Amazon and they were going to replace it and I needed to send the broken one back to them. Did that the next day. No new bit ever showed up. When my credit card bill came a month later, I had received credit for the price of the bit only. So now, I am out the shipping costs and I still have no bit."
4,"Nutrition for Health, Fitness & Sport",Excellent book. It is a great source of knowledge for people that are studying sports nutrition or some reltated to it.
3,typical school book...,"Buy it for class, use it, and then sell it to get most of your money back... Its not something you will want to keep to use."
5,it's interesting,"i'm domenico from italy,i want to learn english and this book is very interesting for me. thank you"
4,Very nice apron!,I really like the apron because it doesn't hang on your neck like most do. It is well built and will last a long time. The only thing I would have them improve is the hammer loop but that is minor. It's great for working on projects in my wood shop.
3,For the money a great apron,I have had the bucket boss and the Duluth for the past 10 years. This is my third apron and it looks very comparable to the Duluth. I honestly did not like the webbing and holes at the bottom of the Duluth where the saw dust was to fall out when your pockets got full. The screws and nails also fell out. I think this model will work out better
5,Why did i not buy it before?,"I am a woodworker, and didn't use aprons till now, I found that I am wondering too much in the shop just to get a pencil, ruler, etc.This apron is amazing, it has many pockets in different sizes and in the right place. By fastening the rear strap it doesn't move and I don't feel anything on me. Love it and don't understand how could I work without it before."
3,Great bib..,This is a well built apron but it only comes down to my navel.... If your over 6 feet tall this will come up short.
5,Pret' near perfect,"I work outside, in my garden with the plants, building various outbuildings, with the chickens, and thinning out the woods. This apron is great for gathering eggs, holding the cell phone, nails, little notebook, and so forth. It is very comfortable, durable, washable. The wide shoulder straps are much appreciated."
3,Not that great...,"This may be a fine apron for a skilled woodworker, which I'm not. I'm more of a crawl-around-in-the-attic type of DIYer and I bought this apron as an alternative to a tool belt. As long as you're standing upright, things are OK, but the minute you bend over, something's going to fall out. The pockets should be deeper. A pocket with a velcro flap for an MP3 player would also be good. I'll use this apron until it wears out, but I'll look for something else next time."
4,A solid choice,"This apron so far feels like a winner. The material has been sturdy and the pockets are a nice size. I like how the apron feels around the shoulders and was easy to adjust to fit. I'm 5ft 11"" about 195lbs. If I were a few inches taller it may be on the short side. But it's a perfect size for the average height and build man or woman for that matter. It is much better than wearing a tool belt for woodworking which I can't stand. I would classify it more for woodworking than carpentry though I could see a finish carpenter using an apron such as this. For the price this was a great purchase."
5,Yoppik Great! Company not so Great!,"I was very disapointed with the company. The product was great.I received the small size Toppik. They said that they would send me the one I ordered but have not received that. I let them know and they said it was lost in the mail. They said they would send it again. I am still waiting for that.I am not sure I will order this again from you. I went ahead and ordered from Spencer Forrest as I needed another one. It cost more but I know I will get it.Patricia WhiteGreensboro, North Carolina"
5,Good Product,The product works well since my hair is not too thin. I am able to keep it in place on my scalp with hairspray.
4,Female hair loss,"Like some of the other reviewers stated, as a female it's not at all acceptable to have thinning hair, it really does cause a loss of confidence. I'm in my early 30's and have thinning hair with balding spots along my part. This product works! It covers up very well, no smell, not messy and you don't have to use a lot. I agree that it does come off on your fingers if you rub your scalp(maybe more so for me since I have an oily scalp)and it's pricey, but for me it's worth it...been using it for a few years, it certainly makes fixing my hair in the morning less stressful!"
5,I Wish I Had Found This A Long Time Ago,"This actually does work. It disappears into your hair, is not detectable, and covers the problem spots instantly. It isn't messy and has no scent. It does not comb out and you can use hairspray. It just shampoos out because the fibers are so tiny. This is a great product!"
2,The Chieftains need to get back to their roots,"This is probably the worst CD the Chieftains have ever produced. If you're a fan a Celtic music, then don't buy this. Sometimes they do a good job with crossover albums (eg: The Long Black Veil or Another Country) but this is not one of them. I really could care less for the music with the latin sort of beat...."
5,Beautiful music,My CD came about a week or so after ordering and sounds great. It was a replacement for a lost cassette tape and one of my favorite albums.
5,Beautiful music on unusual instruments.,"Having discovered the Chieftains through Kazaa ('net music sharing isn't bad AFTER all!), I went out and purchased Santiago because I became obssessed with Dueling Chanters. Let me tell you; the music contained on this CD is absolutely amazing. A plethora of various instruments are used (most of which haven't been heard of by the general public), and people who have not heard these amazing instruments (Uilleann pipes, bodhrán, Galician pipes, bones, tin whistle, just to name a few) is definitely missing out on some of the better music of the lands of the world. To think this is all coming from a 16 year old guy, whose peers listen to ""rap"" and ""punk"". Disgraceful to my kind, aren't I? I enjoy actual *music*, not *noise*. Anyone who enjoys aural ecstasy, Santiago is for you."
1,Rather disappointed,"First, the biggest downside with the product is that you MUST use the language disk whenever you want to use the program. There is no way to copy lessons to the hard disk, and a copy protection scheme very effectively prevents you from creating a disk image for use with CD-ROM emulation software. So if you want to use it on an ultralight with no built-in optical drive, you have to connect an external drive.Beyond that, the system, even with the entry level course, provides no explanation or instruction. You start by matching pictures to phrases. I already know a bit of the language, so I could get through the first lesson by guessing the words I don't already know. For a total beginner, however, this program would be completely useless."
5,Minh noi tieng viet!,"The Rosetta Stone products are great. I have bought Vietnamese level 1 and Japanese level 1 and 2. I consider vietnamese to be a much more difficult language to learn since it is a tonal language.This software helped me a lot and now I am even able to chat on the internet with vietnamese people. However, don't think that this software is all you need to learn the language. Since there are no translations(it is only based on pictures, sounds and text in vietnamese) I had to use several dictionaries to help me through the lessons. In this page is a nice and free dictionary for ...And I also recommend a dictionary such as The Rough Guide Vietnamese dictionary where at the beginning is a reference to the basics of the language. This is where you might want to start before studying the lessons in the RS Vietnamese I."
4,This will get you started,"This is a good program to learn a new language. However, they do not convert to English so it takes awhile to figure out the words that you are learning."
5,I cried.,"Well, it had to happen, Maison Ikkoku is at its heart a story about two people, and there's only one way it could end. That said it doesn't end without a fight, there's quite a bit of wrangling and in-fighting to be done before Kyoko Otonashi and Yusaku Godai get their happy ending. It's a real weepy this one, with Yusaku's honest description of his love for Kyoko, the resolution of Kyoko's love for Soichiro, a wedding and quite a few babies all coming before the end. Still it's a classic of manga and indeed of global literature. Takahashi-sensei has done it again. ""...You see this is the place where mummy and daddy first met"" <weeps>Buy this book."
4,A series I never tire of reading,"I must have read MI a dozen times in Japanese, and I recently bought the whole series in English just for fun. I'm generally pleased with the translation, but a mistake in this volume on one of my favorite lines in the whole series prompted me to comment. ""When she laughs, the world is mine"" should be ""When she smiles, the world is mine."" Subtle, but important.Now that I have that off my chest, ignore the nitpicking and buy the whole series. If you like great stories and superb characterization, you can't go wrong.I'm dropping a star for some rough editing at the beginning of the series and for a few other productions problems."
5,A wonderful ending to one of the best sagas ever written,"This is a FABULOUS series!! I own all 14 graphic novels and all of the Television episodes. If you're a fan of American shows like Friends, Will & Grace and Frasier, then you'll love Maison Ikkoku. You'll laugh and cry as you view the life of Poor College Student Yusaku Godai, who is helplessly in love with his beautiful apartment manager, Kyoko and tries in vain to thwart his nosy and inebriated neighbors. It's great! Buy it today!"
2,READ REVIEW,"I THOUGHT IT WAS SHANNON CRAWFORDS CELLOPHANE, AND BOUGHT IT BY ACCIDENT. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER CELLOPHANE, OR IF THEY HAVE MORE THEN ONE ALBUM, WRITE IT IN A REVIEW."
3,You mean the band from the late 90's?,"I remember the band ""Cellophane"" from the late 90's. My god they rocked. I miss them! They broke up a year after their debut CD. I was so sad, they rocked and no one even knew them. I'm glad I'm not the only fan."
5,Comprehensive and easy to read,Excellent resource for somebody who directly manages advertising budgets and reviews creative and copy!
4,Good coverage,"The liner doesn't cover the back ""perfectly"" wall to wall like in the picture, but it does cover very well. It's very sturdy. I don't have to worry about getting the carpet stained, or full of dog hair. I would recommend this to anyone and would buy one for my next vehicle."
2,It's so so,"My printer doesn't seem to like it. It gets stuck very easily, and when it does print it becomes blurry."
2,SLOW Drying Paper - Not Recommended,"We picked up this ""HP Everyday Photo Paper"" to print product pictures for my wife's small business on better quality paper than ""plain paper"". The end results are better than plain paper, but far below most other lower cost photo paper. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Inexpensive; for photo paper, this is relatively low pricedCons -- Slow Drying; myBrother MFC-6490CW Professional Series Color Inkjet Wireless All-in-One Printerhas fairly quick drying ink on most papers, but was really surprised that my prints smudged even after sitting for more than five minutes- Marginal Image Quality; no amount of tweaking I could do produced ""outstanding"" resultsWe will use the rest of this paper, but will not buy it again.CFH"
3,just too thin,"The picture quality is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but the paper is just to thin. it's like magazine pages almost. I was expecting a heavier stock. If you want a hardy paper that doesn't curl up, this is not the paper for you."
1,This paper is awful,"I've been delighted with many HP products over the last 30 years (I still have my first HP calculator), but this photo paper is just hideous. I bought a 100-sheet pack for use with my Canon Pixma printer, which produces lovely photos on a variety of vendors' papers.But when it comes to HP ""Everyday"" Photo Paper, I've experimented with a variety of printer settings to see if I can come up with an acceptable combination, but to no avail.In a nutshell, the paper's surface seems to resist, rather than attract, ink. A photo printed on this paper takes forever to dry, and when it does, it has a grainy, blotchy appearance, worse than any other photo paper I've ever used.I'm a frugal person, so the step I took just before writing this review -- tossing more than half this package into recycling -- was not taken lightly. I suggest you avoid purchasing this paper."
3,It is EVERYDAY paper after all,"Look - if you want to print an heirloom to pass down through the generations, this is not the paper. If you need cheap paper -- becuase your children don't write down their homework and tell you at 9:50p.m. the night before that they need a picture of themselves for class, never to be returned -- this is the paper for you!We use this paper like crazy for just about any school work you can imagine. The quality is fine for projects and science fair boards. That is really all you can say."
1,Don't Buy,"I have used plenty of photo paper even no name brands, but this is the worst I have ever purchased and the most expensive. The paper will not feed thru, just keep jamming my printer. I had planned to print and give some photos at Christmas gifts. Didn't happen. I have been able to print 3 sheets so far and have messed up more than 10. I won't be using this because it wastes time and is very frustrating unjamming paper. I certainly do not want it to mess up my printer. (The printer was set for this type paper.)"
5,Has always worked flawlessly,After more than 2000 case covers on different printers (HP) have never had a single problem. Great product at great price. Even photos are fine for my needs.
5,Prints Splendidly,"My pictures printed on this paper with the greatest of ease and looked simply fantastic, to be sure."
4,In the tradition of Anne of Green Gables....,"My family has had this book forever (It's an edition from 1905) and I just happened to read it today. It's a very witty book and if you like Anne of Green Gables or Sara Crewe you will appriciate it. Be prepared for several short stories revolving around the main character, a teacher named Belinda. There isn't a narrative through the whole book, so it just ends abrubptly on one of the short stories."
5,the earl of blues,"i didn't think this ronnie was as good as some of the black top stuff - deep blues, soul searchin', peace of mind - it is still ronnie earl. he carries the title of guitar virtuoso, and deservedly so. any ronnie earl disc is worth owning, this one included."
5,Mystery and romance in Amish country!,"A great story! Mystery, romance and adventure--in a quiet Amish community? Yes! Yes!A lady lawyer leaves the big city seeking safety from a stalker for herself and her young niece. They come to Maplecreek to operate a friend's quilt shop. The peaceful community is disrupted when four young Amish are killed by a mysterious hit and run driver. The lawyer-in-hiding feels compelled to find the killer of her young friends.Meanwhile an uneasy relationship is building between the worldly lawyer and a 'plain' man who has returned from life outside to commit himself to the Amish ways.The author pieces together her story like a fine Amish quilt and keeps the reader guessing until the end. The characters are very well developed and believable and I look forward to reading more from Ms Harper"
5,The only thing that worked for my three year old,"To Pee or Not to Pee is an extremely fun and motivating potty training book. Potty training was going nowhere until I bought the book for my son. His motivation increased tremendously. Even better, he's finally potty trained.Parents, the text stays fresh even with many readings. This book really works."
3,Fun and Friendly; Confusing and,"This is a great supplement to another potty book. It is low-key and humourous and reminds parents to let their child set the pace and experiment. However, we had to skip over some of the humourous experimenting that the boy in the book tries; my son was inspired and starting throwing toys in the potty. In addition, when the boy Will finally decides to go pee, the picture and words don't match (the words say he is pulling down his pajamas, but the picture shows jeans and a t-shirt). Normally not a big deal, but during potty-training, our kids are scouting for details. There are no details about potty-training in this book-- ie: washing hands, pants up and down, etc. Overall, a great book; my son loves it and ""reads"" it on his own and brings it to me several times a day. Incidentally, the stickers and tattoos in the back were a great motivator."
3,"Good for the beginner, not the advanced fan","While well constructed, this book is largely constructed from previous interviews and press articles. If you've read a lot or seen a lot about Johnny Cash, there won't be a lot that's new to you here.That being said, this is a good introduction to the spiritual and philosophical side of Johnny Cash. Cash: The Autobiography is also a great starting point."
1,Cheap,I can't believe how cheap looking/feeling this clock is. If I could give 0 stars I would. I looked all over the description and no where did it say that the clock was plastic! I was expecting a nice ceramic/porceline clock. I should've known better because it was so cheaply priced. Next time I'll write to ask about it. Do NOT buy this clock. It is basically a white plastic dish with ivy stickers. A waste of money! I would ship it back but it would cost more to return it than it is worth. Maybe someone will buy it in the rummage this year.
2,Doesn't include the gps receiver,"I purchased this as well as a cradle to install on my Palm Treo. Unfortunately, I didn't read everything closely. Had I been more aware of the fine print I would have realized that this was the software only. GPS receiver NOT included. I ended up returning the software.I suspect that if you are in need of an update to your maps, then this is the product for you. If you are looking to have the whole system, make sure you get all the pieces you need. If you are buying this for a Palm Treo, I recommed buying directly from the Palm Website. The whole package offered directly from the Palm website includes the software, the gps receiver and the cradle for less $ than if you buy all the components independantly from Amazon. Additionaly, you know that it will work with your palm product."
5,Excellent Product,"I've had two other PDA navigation products before this one and neither can even come close to matching the TomTom's features and performance. The detailed information like distance to next turn (as opposed to just the destination) is superior to the navigation systems that came with my new BMW and Acura (I bought the Tom Tom for rental car use). I've travelled extensively with it and haven't had a single issue yet. I am really impressed with the way it displays both the general map and the turning instructions on my tiny screen (plus lots of other info). I don't understand the issues others are having. I noticed some are refering to Nav 5. Perhaps Nav 6 fixed some issues? I'm using mine on a Treo 700p. Maybe it just works better on that platform? In any event, I can't recommend this program enough. It's amazing."
1,Navigator 6 Map accuracy...???,"I purchased this 40 days ago. The installation was not easy, but ok. When using the software on main roads, it is very nice, however the map accuracy in Canada is really decades behind compared with Navteq. I have tried the point of interests and so far, none of the POI's that I know of are present on the Navigator 6 maps...I think I said enough. Do not buy this item...Garmin is still by far the best!"
1,Tom Tom Navigator 6.,"As satnavs go, Navigator 6 was one of Tom Tom's best products for road touring, but was marred by out of date maps of the USA. This (later?) version is no improvement, with maps created by 2006.My experience traveling the USA in 2007 using Tom Tom Navigator 6 software on a HP iPAQ 5215 was that the maps were already 10 years out of date as they did not include substantial new developments like a large tollway through Austin Texas.Sadly, Tom Tom's newer satnav systems seemed to lose much of the functionality of the originals.Buy a new satnav - this is no great use.PS - Though ""Tom Tom Home"" will install on your PC allowing you to see maps, it would appear that the satnav software will only install on a Tom Tom device, not other PDAs."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This product didn't work on my Symbian s60 5th edition phone. It may work on specific models. Tom Tom could not help me as they no longer have updates for this OUTDATED product, not even map updates or maps to purchase, so I don't recommend wasting your money on this product."
2,Wasn't available,The book was already sold after I bought it. Please take it off web site after it's sold. But I was reimbursed properly.
4,Interesting,"This CD was pretty interesting. It is a little hard to follow with no dialogue and no summary of the plot in the cover. I'm not sure if the songs were interlinked into a story or if they were just a bunch of songs meant to stand on their own. I must say that Jessica Molaskey was amazing! All her songs were very inspiring. She is so talented! I loved ""Just One Step"", ""Stars and the Moon"", ""I'm Not Afraid of Anything"" and especially ""Surabaya Santa""! That was such a hillarious song! And the tune of the theme song is pretty catchy. However some of the songs were a little weak. But overall this had some memorable, thought-provoking songs."
5,Simply Astounding!!,"If you only buy 1 CD at amazon.com today, make sure it's this one!! Every song is a winner. The talent of this one man is incredible and so are the cast. A fine addition to the collection of anyone who loves good musicals and well-written music. Pure magic!!"
5,Brilliant,"Jason Robert Brown proves he is the among the foremost faces of Broadway's future in this wonderfully eclectic group of songs from his cabaret style show. The talent on this recording is amazing, and the songs are brilliant. It is my current favorite and among my top ten of all time Broadway CD's."
1,'New World' Gets Old Fast,"Fortunately, Jason Robert Brown's work as the man behind the stirring music of the Broadway flop ""Parade"" is very different from his dismal ""Songs For A New World."" In ""Parade,"" Brown successfully incorporated a variety of musical styles into a colorful and vibrant score. In ""Songs For A New World,"" which plays like a third-rate, light-Rock radio station without the commercials, each track blurs into the next -- with one song essentially indistinguishable from the next. At times it's folksy, at times it's pseudo-hip, but it is never unique, moving, or remotely engaging. In addition, the performers, while vocally competent, never rise above satisfactory. Mediocre material plus mediocre talent equals a mediocre product. ""Songs For A New World"" is proof of this equation."
2,Not Great,"I'll start by saying that I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE Mr. Brown's ""Parade."" But there's only about 6 songs that are listenable on this CD, and I wouldn't really recommend it. A lot of the songs have the same feel to them, and the stories a lot of them tell seem misdirected and unclear. I do think that Brown is bursting with talent and I can't wait for his next show, but this CD just isn't that great. The performers voices didn't move me, and I prefer a bigger orchestra and not a small band. Perhaps the strongest part of this recording is the piano orchestrations, which are very good. Most of the songs rely on the piano, and if you like the piano (which I do) that is a plus."
5,It sent chills up my spine and brought tears to my eyes!,"Fabulous! I can't wait to find the score! Soaring voices, driving rhythms, character songs...this album is reminiscent of the styles of Malty/Shire& Stephen Sondheim."
5,smart and funny,"I bought this to replace a copy that a friend walked off with last year. Christmas just isn't Christmas for me without several airings of Surabaya Santa.I'd like to think that Jason Robert Brown will move past his demonstrable facility with pastiche to do some unique work. Certainly, he's demonstrated on this CD that he understands his predecessors. I eagerly await what he can do as himself."
5,Amazing,"This little revue is an absolutely amazing show. I bought it after enjoying ""Parade"" as much as I did, and this CD is probably the most played one I own. All of the performers are incedibly talented and make each character they portray an entirely separate one, especially Jessica Molaskey. I could never pick a favorite song. There's one for every mood I'm in. Right now, it's ""Hear My Song"", but when I'm in a sillier mood, I'll put on ""Surabaya Santa"" and wish I was an alto. When I'm in a lovey-dovey mood, ""I'd Give It All For You"". No CD collection is complete without this."
4,review from the Philippines,"This is the first CD that I bought online from this site, and I'm absolutely loving it! I came to know about JRB when I managed to read the piano/vocal book of Last Five Years. I did some research online and was totally blown away by his songs - music, lyrics and all.Then I read about this show of his and got immediately intrigued about what JRB has offered. I was reluctant at first, but upon reading the majority of reviews here I finally decided to go for this CD.Now my iPod has Songs for A New World playing most of the time - because I don't want to wear out my wonderful CD. :) Buy this!"
3,Hoping for more.,"This review of this revue will be brief. The songs vary from excellent to fair. The performers are mostly very good. The packaging is poor ( no lyrics, few photos, no background of the songs). After ""Parade"" I was hoping for more from J R Brown. I still am."
1,Please. . .,"I bought this disk after the really interesting show `3hree' was brought to my attentiona nd I became interested imn newer composers.3hree is realy solid, but this disc is already on its way to the library as a donation. The songs are flabby, unmelodious, and trivial. The composer is utterly without talent comparatively. This is a PR job all the way."
2,Adam & Eve - 'Die Fruehen Jahre & Raritaten' (Bear Family),"Hate to admit it, but I was majorly let down with this 2-CD, 54 track Adam & Eve import release. In English the title translates to 'The Early Years & Rarities'. Most would consider this music as rhythm and blues. Comes with a 60-page CD booklet. I believe Adam & Eve have a couple of other titles out there. Out of all the CD reviews I have ever done, this may be only the third piece I've covered on the Family Bear label. Heard that the German label is known for the top notch sound quality of their compilation CD's."
2,Rosetta Stone Arabic,"I find this program to be very poor. The concept of looking at pictures and hearing the words is good but the choice of vocabulary is poor. Why do I need to know the word elephant as a beginner? When I arrive in Egypt, I will want to say how are you, my name is etc. I will not need to say, ""The girls jump"". So far I (ana) has not been mentioned so I don't know how to conjugate any verb with I. I do not recommend this product."
3,"Really like the format, However:","I also have the Auralog Tell Me More Arabic and have only browsed through both of them a little bit (under an hour). So far I am liking the Rosetta Stone's structure better so far (go online and do a demo of Spanish or something). However, there is a big problem with Rosetta Stone; on one of my desktops and one laptop they both always have 100% CPU Usage, this is very annoying. Although I have a Pentium M it still gets loud and very, very hot when running at 100%. I would like to be able to use Dragon Naturally Speaking Pro 8 with it if it is possable, but with CPU at 100% it just crawls. I hope there is a work around on this other wise I'll be forced to use Auralog's Tell Me More. I tried downloading Daemon Tools and set up a virtual CD-Rom drive and that doesn't do anything either."
2,Online version consumes 100% cpu... useless.,"I just subscribed to the online version (9/9/2006) to study Chinese and upgraded to the 9.x player, however running the app still consumes 100% of the cpu on my Mac G4 laptop. This makes it pretty unusable. I have read many other complaints about this. I can't imagine why they won't address it.It's hard to give it a full review with this problem. It does look interesting, although it's very limited by the flash functionality. You can't resize the window, no cut & paste of text... no way to look up a definition easily. I understand that they want more of an immersion style, but sometimes you still want to look up the precise definition of a word...I would say that this software (at least the online version) is not ready for prime time.Pat"
4,"Flows nicely, lots of laughs","Oscillating between spoken word skits, song based comedy and outright instrumentals this is probably my favourite Cheech & Chong album. It just hit me harder even than their Greatest Hit album.As with all C&C; albums you have to get used to the idea of relentless drug references. And complaining about getting 'busted'. And the odd bit of profanity - but this isn't on par with either Chris Rock or Billy Connolly.What it is however is an album that flows, an album that because of it's inherent variety actually works as something you can listen to from end to end. And that is a rarity in the comedy world."
3,A Knight to Remember,A Night to Remember: See reviews for Ms. Dodd's books above--much the same--enjoyable light reading good for a plane ride or vacation trip
4,A Knight to Remember,I enjoy historical romance and this was a very enjoyable read. not the typical all male dominated action. very enjoyable
2,Way to long to be anything but boring,"This book was way to long. It could have ended a long time before it actually did and would have been a perfectly good book. It was a strugle to finish with Hugh being such a pigheaded man. The way he treated Edlyn, like a possession, was totally uncalled for. Normally, I don't get all ""hot and bothered"" about the way men treat woman in these books because they usually come around in the end. But at the end of this book, I was not so sure that Hugh really did come around or if Edlyn just gave up. I found this book lacking with Ms. Dodd's usual storytelling abilities. This book just didn't grab me and wrap me in the way her other books did."
2,A reasonable read,"Unusual use of language and phrasing. One needs to read on to truly enjoy the best part of the story. All in all, I had to finish it to see what happened. Entertaining enough"
1,MINE WES DEFECTIVE,"I READ MANY GREAT REVIEWS ON THIS SCOPE BEFORE I BOUGHT ONE. BUT THE ONE I GOT NEVER STAYED SIGHTED IN FOR MORE THAN THREE SHOTS......I SHOT HORNEDAY, WINCHESTER, CCI,CCI TNT AMMO. NOT ONE HELD A GROUP.I HAD A BSA SWEET SIXTEEN ON MY 10-22 AND I PULLER IT OFF AND PUT ON MY HMR. WITHIN FIVE SHOTS I PUT TWO IN THE BULLSEYE AT 100 YARDS. THE NEXT FIVE WERE ALL IN THE BULLSEYE WIHT THREE SHOTS MAKING A CLOVER LEAF. MAYBE I JUST GOT A BAD MUELLER BUT ITS MY LAST MUELLER."
4,Handy little tool.,"The clipper II is a handy starter setup for processing both 35mm and 120 film. Loading the reel is easy and the quantity of chemical needed is clearly printed on the tank. Inversion is not recommended but the rotating agitation process gives excellent results. If it didn't leak when it's up side down I'd give it 5 stars. Actually, I don't think it's intended to be inverted.A good tool."
3,Love is Forever Transfer,"For some reason Love is Forever is virtually impossible to find in a good transfer to dvd. Frankly I do not think adequate source material exists. Every one I try including this one looks grainy, and the sound level is only adequate. I suppose it is because this is a color movie over 30 years old that was never given the care it deserved. Love Affair, the side B, looks and sounds great. Here's hoping someone finds a well preservrd master and uses it for source material for this fine early Michael Landon and Moira Chen (the Laotian woman he loves) movie that even features Priscilla Presley in a supporting role."
4,"Good, but not the best Nevsky recording.","This CD is good, and if you want the multimedia, you won't find it on other recordings.Only one complaint, but it's major: The shrieking violins that are heard as the Germans ride across the frozen lake are treated as an accent to the bassoons and the rest of the orchestra. They are almost in the background.They should be right out in front, good and loud, sending chills down your spine! This is the only recording of Nevsky I have heard treat it that way, and if you've grown up hearing it the ""right"" way, it's a bit anticlimactic.If you put a good recording of this in, and drive on an uncrowded freeway, check your speedometer half-way through the ride across the lake. Mine's usually around 90!"
5,Beautiful writing; compelling anthropology,"""In Amazonia"" tells an engaging and well-researched story of epic proportions. Raffles' lyrical style draws the reader close to the narrative but stops short of romanticizing. Appropriate for academic research or an interested layperson. Highly recommended!"
1,Who in academia chooses these?,"Sorry, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. It is overwritten and makes no worthwhile point. It is both incoherent and disjointed, and incorporates many stray Portuguese words no one would want to know.This is a fine example of the waste that often pervades academic presses."
5,Both my sons love these blocks,My 2 year old got these for his birthday 6 months ago and he has played with them every day since!
3,Superb but Incomplete,"Anything by Mathtutordvd will be sure to please butin this case I am asking that the company put theENTIRE course on Amazon.Specifically, This TI-89 Tutor is a two volume setbut you can only order vol.I on Amazon. Vol. II mustcome from mathtutordvd.com. Why is that a problem?Because you are charged $9.99US minimum for shipping.Yikes!The price for the dvds is the same for either site but10 bucks to ship a $27 dvd is not right. If Jason canafford to ship for free off Amazon than please put upVol II. All their stuff is so great.Here's Hoping."
2,Stimulating entertainment,"The references in the book might be useful, but the content has all the appearance and unbelievability of entertainment.An example is the electric power meter can supply free energy.Like coffee, this book can be a stimulant, and like coffee which does not build muscles or other tissues, this book won't help you build a flying saucer or anything else. It might stimulate the imagination."
4,How Long Can This Technology Be Kept Secret?,"After reading this book, and I've read alot on this subject, I really don't know who the real propaganda dictators really are. What the truth is and which publishing companies are CIA fronts. But Lyne seems to be convincing with his story! You decide."
5,"Review of ""As I Lay Frying"" by Fay Jacobs",Very funny and book. I can relate to alot of her stories since I make Rehobeth Beach my annual vacation spot.
4,Excellent accessory for Canon PowerShot,I purchased this item to use with a Canon PowerShot S230. When I am using the camera I tend to just have it around my neck or in a shirt pocket but I wanted a travel bag that would protect it when not in use.PROSThis case is great. I own other Lowepro D-Res cases and it is made with the same quality materials etc.The size is perfect for the S230. The camera fit is very snug but leaves enough room to fit a spare battery and CompactFlash card in the small inner pocket.CONSThe case is a bit thick and does not sit well under a shirt or jacket when you place it on your belt. The design could have placed the inner pocket on the outside on the side to reduce the thickness.
3,The Triple Threat,"You might remember Paul Laurence for his brilliant production of some of Freddie Jackson's biggest hits(""tasty love"", ""main course"" and of course ""rock me tonight"")But what you might not know is that he was one of the premiere song writer/producers of the 80's.Paul produced such acts as the legendary smokey robinson and stephanie mills(""puttin' a rush on me"").To top all of that off, he was a fine vocalist that had a couple of minor radio hits. The most popular being ""cut the crap"" which is featured here on his ""underexposed"" cd. This cd contains a few jewels such as the heart felt ""she's gone"" and one of my favorites ""sue me"".Check out ""main course"", i was groovin' to that song long before freddie coverd it.This cd is a true collector's item.(oop)"
3,Let's go up the pub wi' Ian!,"Ian Gomm was an original member of Brinsley Schwarz, the late-70's ""pub-rock"" pioneers who also seeded the career of Nick Lowe. This CD anthology pretty much gives you everything you need for your Ian Gomm collection, including of course his biggest hit ""Hold On"" (sounding quite similar to former bandmate Nick Lowe's ""Cruel To Be Kind"", which was also getting radio airplay at about the same time). You will also find the outstanding ""Man On A Mountain""on here. If you're a fan of the power pop/rockabilly hybrid of Rockpile or the solo Nick Lowe/Dave Edmunds releases of the same era, this one's for you!"
4,Good hand soap,Filled the dispenser in the guest bath and have received many compliments and inquiries to the type of soap used. High quality with a great fresh smell.
4,12 Songs From Emmylou Harris' Early Years.,"Emmylou Harris first came to the attention of country music followers when he sang with Gram Parsons in the early 1970s, before Gram's untimely death in 1974.Emmylou's voice is entirely suited to the country music of that time as it moved away from the traditional confines of the 1950s and 1960s.Several top writers provide songs here, including Dolly Parton and Billy Sherrill, and she gives them her own stamp of quality, all with some top class backing musicans, like Byron Berline and Herb Pedersen, to name just two.All in all very listernable from start to finnish, if you like this you could try her albums from that era."
5,Vintage Emmylou,"Not a real c&w fan, I purchased this cd for C'est la Vie (written by Chuck Berry) and every song was wonderful."
5,Great service,"This got to me quickly, and even though it saidit was used, it is in like new condition!"
2,Not her best,I purchased this for my husband who likes this type of music. I bet I can count on one hand how many times he's listened to it and have fingers left over.
3,Remastered Mess,"I recently purchased this Saxon compilation CD thinking the newer technologies available would improve on the sound of previous decades. I admit the sound is clear however I am very disappointed in the over equalization of the tracks. The bass is not even close to the original recordings and quite boomy. I love Saxon and resisted returning the CD to the seller out of disgust. For the Saxon collector, this release will add to your collection and the song choices are great. If you're looking to improve on the original releases, you will be disappointed. There are other Saxon compilations released that I believe are truer to form. Metal Rules!"
4,"I was not a big Saxon fan back in the 80's, they actually..","were not up to the Iron Maiden, UFO or Priest sound back in the day. I got this cd at my local grocery store for about $8 and I got if basically for Denim and Leather and Strong Arm of the Law. Well, I am glad I got it. It rocks and I have been listening to Saxon more and more. It is probably the best selection of greatest hits compilation that I have ever owned."
5,Like it fine,"I agree with a previous review to a degree but while the display is dim in bright daylight, I don't really care to read the radio but rather concentrate on the road. I use mp3 cds and have become used to the controls such that I never have to read the display to tell me what song is up next.The controls are laid out well enough that you can remember them in a short amount of time. mp3/wma playback is a must for me since I have much more music on mp3. Finding a unit with an aux port will result in spending about $50 more than the asking price of this unit.This unit comes in black, which matches my decor great. If it were silver like a lot of other units following the trend/fad, I would have had to resort to painting it."
3,Great Sound / Dim Display,I was very happy with the sound quality of this stereo especially when paired with an ipod through the auxiliary cable and continue to enjoy it. The LCD display is viewable both day and night though the green buttons you can only see at night. The biggest problem with it is how dim the overall display is... take note that the display is not NEARLY as bright as all of the pictures on the internet show you. The pictures online show a shiny black stereo with bright neon green buttons and lights and this is not the case. In summary if you don't care about looks and just want good quality with an aux. input its a great buy. If you want something bright and flashy keep on looking.
2,MP3 worth the price.,"I purchased this unit because it had an MP3 connection. The FM reception was so bad, I pulled the unit out to check if the antenna was connected. Unfortunately it was."
1,Arrived DOA,"I ordered to two pack bundle and in each pack, two of the batteries were dead. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem. The packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time. Sort of dirty. Also purchased D batteries as well and that packaging was worse.Hard to knock the fact they are made in China because let's admit it, pretty much everything you buy is made in China. The problem is the poor quality control from the company Juice Battery themselves. These are actually ok batteries if they work, but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or DOA.Even though still most likely made in China, stick to the main well-known brands instead of this junk."
2,awful tripe,run as far and as fast away from this drivel as possible. this is truely an awful attempt at literature...it sucks.
5,WOW!!!,"I have read all of Walter Mosley's ER books along with his FJ books. This book is one of the best books I have ever read, regardless of authors. Mr. Mosley takes the reader down a path that even a 41 year old know it all like myself was shocked and awed. I know this is a cliche, but I couldn't put the book down! Everytime I thought the action would slow down, Mr. Mosley went in another direction just as fast. Bravo Mr. Mosley, Bravo!"
3,Just OK...,My husband raves about Walter Mosley and this was my first introduction to one of his books. I didn't care for it much but I'm going to read a couple of his other books and see if I like those better. If it hadn't been for the voracious sex scenes it would have been pretty boring.
3,It was ok,The book was well written but a little over the top in some parts. Sex scenes were well described though.
2,Incest and anal,"I wanted a sexy mystery, I got a sad story about anal, incest and a mild mental disorder thrown in 1/2 way through for no reason. I had to stop reading half way though. Just not for me."
1,Killing Johnny Fry,"I have read and loved all of Walter Mosleys books. However, this book was ridiculous. I am definitely not a prude about any sex BUT this book was a bit much. If I wanted to enjoy porn in its purest form, I certainly would not expect to read about it from this author. ""L"" the main character lusts after every woman and each sexual act is described in detail to the point of some being gross. Come on a little goes a long way in a Mosley novel. I absolutely hated this book and got to the point where I just skimmed through until I could try to understand the story and NOT the sex."
2,"Now I know who killed Johnny Fry, Do you ?","Cordell Carmel, is Joelle boyfriend they have been seeing each other for sometime.They are together mostly on the weekend, but this day Cordell who people call him L gos back Jos apartment on a week day and guess who he fines there? Yes he there Johnny Fry, and L catch them in the act of ??????????? I love Walter Mosley books but this was a little to much. Pl"
3,"""Charged""","In between peals of laughter at the review below that begins ""I bought this for my daughter"" I'll try to put this book in perspective.I say that the book is ""charged"" because it is both sexually and emotionally prodding. I had trouble putting it down because I wanted to know what Cordell does to Joelle and to Fry. I want to know who he sleeps with. I want to know whether he's professionally successful. Mosley has always been good at hitting the right nerve to keep you interested and reading, and he has just happened to choose a somewhat different entre in this book. From experience, it isn't the most comfortable book to read while riding a crowded subway, but it was entertaining and engrossing, and like many potboilers, somewhat forgettable."
2,all over the place,"I felt this book lacked some substance The contents were all over the place,at times I didn't know where I was. Lol"
3,To compress or not to compress...,This is louder than the 1990 release and a bit tinny. Sounds not bad but this album always needed the lower registers to be cranked up.
5,It's on my top 10 album list of all time,This album is simply one of the best new wave/punk/? albums I've have ever heard!
4,just for the record...,"spandau ballet formed in 1979.human league formed in 1977, but did not release an album until 1979.thompson twins formed in 1977, but did not release their debut until 1981.visage formed in 1978, but debuted in 1980....let's all learn some history before shouting that a band is ripping off someone else, eh?"
5,What a Debute!,"Devo emerged fully formed on this, their first album. And it's still their best album. The stand out songs are ""Mongoloid"", ""Jocko Homo"", and ""Uncontrollable Urge"". They introduce the concept of De-evolotion on this LP. They would futher explore and develope it on future releases.Devo was a band that would not sit still. Each LP brought with it a new look and sound for the band. Here they popularised the yellow suits, the future would bring the energy domes and the smart patrol.Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! Was the start of Devo's comentary/parody of modern life. As vital now as the day it was originaly released."
5,And an extra star for good behavior.,"I'm convinced that this album is encoded somewhere in human DNA, perhaps entwined with our monkey genes. This was one of the most influential albums of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. [I wrote this review in the previous century. And in this century, it seems like it's even more influential now. How many cover bands are playing these songs????!!! Devo toured in '05, playing almost the complete playlist from Are We Not Men. Ok. The spud boys are bucking for retirement and need the cash. But the staying power of this one quirky album is truly amazing.]"
1,"Same old, same old generic corporate slop","This band totally bit their style and message from such Euro-synth groups as Human League, Thompson Twins and Visage.Get a grip, people, if not for those bands Devo wouldn't even exist.Go listen to the Spandau Ballet song ""Coffee Club"" and then listen to ""Gut Feeling"". Um, Spandau Ballet CALL YOUR LAWYER!!! Plaigirism!!!"
1,Too big,"Way too big for common sized developing tank. Description was not accurate, said it was for 120 sized film, but didn't fit my tank. But, easy to return with no hassle."
2,Near miss....,I like the Boston Pops. I love Glenn Miller. But I do not like them together. The music has no edge. It's way too sterile and sanitized.
5,"""Runnin' Wild"" - Boston Pops","I've had a copy of this CD for a long time. It is a great one. I have a friend that also loves this kind of music, and I bought this CD to give to her. She loves it!"
5,Good old times,"My father used to listen Glenn Miller. For me, hearing this is to go back to my childhood, with the plus of Pizzarelli, that I like a lot. Great songs, great disc!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised by the Quality,"We are big fans of Melissa & Doug products in this house. My daughters received this as a gift and it was a hit! Assembly is required, but the blocks are pretty simple to put together - it probably took about 10-15 minutes for my husband and me to get put together all 40 of them. I really was surprised by the high quality of the material... I feared since the blocks were made of cardboard, that they would not hold up to the rough play of a 2-year-old and 4-year-old. Thankfully, I have been proven wrong! In fact, we're thinking of purchasing another box!"
4,FUN FUN FUN,"Great fun for kids of all ages, just wish there were more large blocks! These will be played with for MANY years to come."
5,Imagination plus!,"Melissa & Doug Jumbo Blocks are the greatest. A very durable toy that our 4 yr old grandson loves.One boxes is not enough, sure glad I bought 2! Toy for years of creativity for all ages.Deluxe Jumbo Cardboard Blocks"
4,"Good blocks, wish there were more larger ones","Overall we are pleased. There are enough blocks here to entertain one or two kids. I could envision getting a second set so they can build bigger things. There are very few of the largest (red) blocks, and many of the small yellow ones. I would have liked more of the big ones. Generally easy to assemble the blocks but time consuming. The other issue with this is storage. One they are assembled you need to find somewhere to store them. We are using an old box--not sure that's going to work long term. Blocks are sturdy--my son stepped on a few rather hard and they withheld."
5,Great Product!,"Ok we looked At Toys-R-US and they had one kinda like this but not the big box blocks. So we came here. The blocks are a Hit my boys stack-em and tear-em down! Fun, Fun, Fun"
5,Still a favorite 4.5 years later,"My son received this for Christmas when he was 2.5 years old. He still uses them at age 7. The have been used for everything from fort building, tunnels for his Thomas Trains, launch pads for his match box cars to homes for various stuffed animals. They are still in great shape despite all of the use. I highly recommend them."
3,"Love the blocks, but not a great price for the variety of sizes","I wish I would have known the quantities of each size block before ordering, because I probably would have chose another set. I was thinking that there were going to be more of the larger red blocks in this set than were actually included, and with the sizes that we received it's hard for my kids to build anything very large. There are 8 red blocks, 8 blue blocks and 24 of the pretty much useless little yellow blocks. I love how durable they are, but this set just isn't a very good mix of the sizes."
5,I love these blocks.,"The best toys are open-ended, to let kids use their imaginations when they play with them, and these blocks are just the ticket. I had these blocks as a child, my daughter had a set when she was little, I use them in the classrooms at my child development center, and now my nephew is enjoying his set. There are enough in the set to let kids build really big structures - a fort large enough to hide in, a very tall wall, etc. If you can only get a kid one gift, this is a great one to choose."
5,Melissa & Doug blocks,"My almost 2 yr old grandson loves them. Had one damaged block, called the 800 number for Melissa & Doug and they sent me an entire package of new blocks in the size that the one was damaged. Would and have bought from them again & again."
3,40 BLOCKS IS NOT ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got 2 set of these blocks so 80 total. It sounds like a lot right? Not really....Since most of them are small there is not even enough blocks to build a fort or something like that. They are not bad, ok quality(my friend has a ToysRus brand and they seam to be more glossier than M and D).My boys mostly play with jumbo ones, so little ones end up in the corner. I wish I would've bought 32 BIG RED BLOCKS for the same price since that's what 80 M and D ones measure up to be."
1,Not as durable as suggested by description or photograph. Sizes & Colors options are not distributed properly for creative play.,"It is just a set of colored boxes and nothing else. It is totally not worth paying so much!Other problems:1. It is not as durable as it seems from the photographs.2. Size & color options are few and not distributed properly. As a result, there are very few good ways to build designs out of them."
5,MY SON'S FAVORITE,We bought this for my son when he turned one. Two and a half years later and he still builds magnificent 'towers' daily for hours. They didn't start falling apart until his little brother became old enough to get his teeth into them. They are worth the price.
3,ok if you have the space,We had a friend that had these and thought they were awesome. I had to have them. My son loves to build with them. Problems.... you have to put them all together correctly. If you are off on one it makes it hard to stack. They are kind of hard to stack anyway. This can be frusterating to a child They are hard to store if you don't have the space. Save your money and get boxes at the local grocery store. This way you won't feel guilty when you want to throw them out.
5,Just what I ordered,"Got Christmas presents early this year and this was the best deal. Later saw similar product in stores, but half the amount of blocks at twice the price. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Funny,You are better off buying a moving box and paint that with a crayon or two! Its nothing better than the box it ships the contents.
4,Jumbo blocks,"We love these. My 4 year old does like to walk on them and has crushed 2 of them. As far as building with them, this set contains enough for 1-2 children. You get 3 different sizes and colors."
4,"Great toy for little engineers, but needs more big blocks","We bought this for our little girl who loves to build things with wood blocks. This set of cardboard blocks was just thing to take it to the next (bigger) level and she loves them. The blocks were easy to put them together (though a bit time consuming) and while they don't stand up to being stepped on (it is cardboard after all) they seem very sturdy and they stay in brick shape.My only issue is that there are a lot more of the small, yellow bricks than there are of the big red ones or medium blue ones. The small yellow ones are just a bit bigger than a box of butter while the red ones are shoe box size. Would be nice to have equal amounts of each.Hope you find this helpful!"
5,Great product,"I bought this for my 15 month old baby brother for Christmas this year. They are very simple to put together. I had these when I was little so I know he will love them. The age is 2 and up but with supervision, there will be no problem. My only concern is that he will build something, climb it, and fall. He also might try to eat them, but those are my only concerns. I received the package earlier than expected and in great condition. I can't wait to see him discover them on Christmas Day. :D"
4,"Simple, easy fun","I had seen these used in a daycare years ago, so when i saw them I had to order them for my home daycare. Does not come assembled, but once you assemble one or two you will get the hang of it. The kids love to build towers out of them and knock them over, they step on them and they withstand the beating."
5,Great Classic Toy,"Great product! I bought for my nephews, ages 2 & 5. They love it! When I helped in the Sunday School nursery years ago, the kids loved these blocks the most. My nephews play with them almost every day. They jump on them & knock them down a lot, so some of the pieces have small indentions, but that is to be expected with boys & cardboard!!You will not be disappointed with this toy. Well worth the price!"
5,Great Product!,We bought this for our daughters second birthday! She is really into building and stacking things. I had bought the cardboard blocks because I was expecting our second child and didn't want him to get hit in the head with a hard or heavy block. They are so sturdy my daughter can stand on them. Great structure!
2,Too slippery to stack properly,"I really like the idea of the big cardboard blocks. I remember them from my youth having a matte finish, and was disappointed that this set has a very slippery shiny surface. This means that they slide a great deal and are hard for younger kids to stack."
2,jumbo? hardly.,i bought these blocks thinking they were going to be like the one's i had when i was a kid. no such luck. only 8 of the 40 blocks are what i'd even classify as jumbo. 24 of the blocks are about the size of a box of checks. the set we bought as kids from The Learning Store was much more durable. i am disappointed in Melissa and Doug for misrepresentinig the item; they're usually pretty good. don not recommend at all. of course i paid full price for the item...now its $14.99 great.
3,Good Condition,Good for young children however made of cardboard which makes them easily destroyed. All in all an ok item.
1,Too difficult to assemble,"I bought these blocks thinking that I would be able to assemble each block easily. They are way too complicated to assemble. I felt like I was doing Origami, the instruction also was very long. I didn't think I would assemble 24 or 36 of them, specially with a young toddler at home."
5,Jumbo Cardboard Blocks,"I had been searching for these blocks for years, I used to have these when I was a child and loved playing with them so much that I wanted my daughter to have the experience of imaginative play with them as well. I was pleased with the product and how fast it arrived at my house after I ordered them. A+ for the seller!"
5,BLOCKS,"They are big cardboard blocks. If you were looking for anything other than basic cardboard blocks, then obviously these are not for you. They are tedious to put together, but once constructed they hold their own against the abuses of a 30lb toddler. He throws them, stands on them, and hits me with them; but they have maintained their shape.I would like to see a set with a single size as the smaller ones aren't that fun to play with."
3,"Wonderful product, small quantity","The kids love these, but they are quite small. They are great for a doll size house, but if you want to build a fort big enough for the kids, you will need to order several sets of jumbo size only bricks."
2,Disappointed--these are not JUMBO,I was disappointed when we put these blocks/boxes together. The largest of the blocks is smaller than most of the shoe boxes I have. My kids love to build forts so I thought this would be a great gift...not so. Whoever decided to call these JUMBO boxes needs to look up the word jumbo in the dictionary. If I hadn't bought these so far in advance of Christmas I would have returned them.
1,PAPER CUTS BEWARE!!!!,THESE WOULD BE GREAT IF THE ENDS OF THE BOXES DID NOT HAVE RAZOR SHARP EDGES. RECEIVED SOME PAPER CUTS PUTTING THEM TOGETHER. I NOTICED BLOOD ON THE BOXES AFTER A SHORT WHILE OF PLAY TIME AND DISCOVERED THAT MY 2 N HALF YEAR OLD WAS GETTING CUTS FROM JUST PLAYING WITH THEM. NOW I HAVE TO PLACE TAPE ON ALL EDGES SO WE CAN ENJOY THEM. OVERPRICED FOR A FEW LARGE BOXES (SMALL) AND A BUNCH OF SMALL(SMALLER)BOXES. WOULD BE A NICE BUY IF THE TAPE WAS INCLUDED AND PRICE DROPPED.
4,"Sturdy, fun but not too many of the big blocks","I had these blocks when I was little and loved them. They are very sturdy, colorful and fun. The only disappointment was that I was thinking we'd get many more of the ""big red"" blocks but this package is much more of the smaller yellow blocks than I expected. Still a great set and for the price I'm happy. Since my kids are only 1 and 3 the small blocks are fine for stacking but once fort building comes .. I'll have to buy some bigger sized blocks."
5,Provides hours of imaginative play!,"My son received these over a year ago and has played with them non stop everyday. He makes bridges for his train, walls and forts, roads, etc. They are a great size and keep him occupied for hours."
4,Great fun for all ages,"We bought two packs. Enough to build a large fort/castle. These blocks were daunting for someone with large clumsy hands to assemble, but my wife jammed them out pretty quick.Our son and his friends/cousins love these. We've seen adults make 7' tall towers out of them, and its fun watching our 1 yr old ""kak"" (stack).They are very durable, as long as you dont get them too wet. They have a minor glossy finish, but can be easily destroyed (like everything really) by little sharp teeth. However, with supervision, we found our little 7 month old (at the time) loved watching these tip over.Great colors, durable, fun to use.Plus a parents favorite:NO BATTERIES = NO ANNOYING SOUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!.....editing this review.My son has been building steps and using the red blocks to turn off lights in rooms, etc. These have really held up well. The yellow are flimsy, but the red/blue are tough beans :)"
4,Building blocks,"My grandsons 6 and 3 love to build with these blocks. They ask for more for every gift giving occasion. They are very sturdy and don't come apart, like I thought they might. Well worth the money."
4,Nice big blocks!!!,"These were easy to put together & they give you a very big box filled with cardboard bricks. My son is building houses, castles, farms; really whatever he can think up. He even made a vet clinic & put all of his animals inside. The shipping was pretty fast. I ordered it, and before I knew it it was here already."
3,Pain,My wife tried to put these together while taking care of a 1 year old and 3 year old. She said the directions were worse than ikea's.
4,Kids LOVE these Blocks!,I have a group of kids age 14mths to 11yrs they all love these blocks. From seeing how high they can stack them to counting how many they ca line up to who can make the biggest castle they have had tons of fun!
2,small bracelet,"the frogs in the picture are even smaller in person, and the bracelet barley fit in my wrist (i have very small wrists). you should buy an extender for this bracelet just in case."
5,LOVE THEM!!!!,"As stated by others who purchased these earrings, the picture doesn't do them justice. They are beautiful and well worth the cost. I immediately put them on upon receiving them. Will enjoy them for many wears!"
5,Exactly what I expected.,They are perfect - I'm even wearing them now. Was a little surprised they didn't come with plastic backings to avoid loss. Luckily I always have spare.
4,Buster Keaton's Our Hospitality,Our Hospitality was a fun movie to watch. Especially the many stunts that Keaton performed himself - some of them not easy. A good film.
5,Music For Your Ears,"If you're the kind of person who likes the sound of tape hiss, and wind running through the trees, this is the band for you. this is IDM for humans. instead of cold digital bleeps that aren't a millisecond off in tempo, the microphones provide you with very human, very fragile sounds that are often slightly out of time, and slightly out of tune. it is the warmest, softest music I have ever heard. when listened to on headphones it actually feels like a pillow. plus, Elvrum actually gives you beautiful songs with heartfelt lyrics, that are cryptic enough to make you think about it a bit, and perfect for the music. whether you're into sonic experimentation or the beauty of humanity's flaws, this band is amazing.I've been debating for a while on whether I liked this album or ""It was hot..."" more, and i've finally come to the conclusion that this is the one that everyone should own. It has just the right mix of catchy songs and experiments with tape."
1,"Dull, Long, Tedius and BORING!","I can't BELIEVE that anyone actually LIKES this music!Album of the decade??? You've got to be kidding me! Right?Bottom line: Don't waste your time, money or effort!"
5,"A living, breathing document of the beauty that exists","The Glow pt. 2 is the most alive album ever. It talks to you and sits with you quietly and gets mad at/with you and kisses your soft hair. The songs are wonderful and sad and well-written. The tones are all so original. ""It was hot..."" was a great album, and Phil Elvrum has made an even better one. What a natural progression.Sit at home and feel with the Microphones. Find those places you usually can't find."
2,"I tried, I swear I did.","I wanted so bad to love 'The Glow, Pt. 2' -- so many people I respect had such nice things to say about it. And after more than a year of trying my hardest to like this record, listening to it at home, in the car, at work, up loud, down low, over headphones, in daylight, after dark, I have this to say: I just don't see what all the fuss is about. When Phil Elvrum decides to put songs together, they're good -- the opening few tracks, especially ""The Moon,"" are fantastic, expansive little slices of lo-fi psychedelia, the universe crammed into a 4-minute pop song. But once those songs end, I'm left with 45 minutes of unfocused recording, almost ambient sounds. When songs fragments do coalesce into something, it reminds me of a Neutral Milk Hotel recording, without the melody. I think Phil's reaching for something unifying, trying to make this a monumental experience, not just another lo-fi pop record; but I can't see what it is he's after"
1,Totally annoying.,"Hi all,I hope you are fine.I just want to let you know that I purchase for a Product exactly like the one in the picture description.SONY 8cm DVD+RW with Hangtab (3pack) but I receive a package with discs NON REWRITABLE FUJIFILM brand instead. I do not know how this happened and why they are not taking seriously the customer needs.This is not the product I purchased and this is not what I need for laboral porpoises I NEED THE REWRITABLE DISCS.I really need the product I purchased and I want to receive a response very soon, this is the forth time I received my package wrong or damage. I rally want a resolution for all this issues.Thanks for your help.Freddy Monge R."
3,dvd + rw WILL NOT WORK WITH CAMCORDER,"Since I bought my camcorder from Amazon I had no way of knowing that it only used negative RW discs and not positive type. Beware. Other than that, I am sure the discs are fine themselves and were a few dollars cheaper than at the store too."
1,Warning: Not compatible with SONY Handycams 100-301,I was disappointed the disks did not work in the earlier Handycams. It would be helpful to customers to highlight this fact in the product information.
1,My Error,"I ordered these disks before I received the camera. When I got the camera, I found out that I had puchased +R instead of -R disks. Since I had opened the package and the ordering error was mine, I did not attempt to return the disks. The are good for putting my coffee cup on them."
4,The ones to use,I think these mini-dvd-rw's are the best way to go when using on a cam-corder. There is no need to finalize the dvd'd if you ant to preview them on the tv or computer. The best thing is that you can use them over and over. Why I didn't give them a 5 star review is that there is only space for 30 minutes of record time so you better keep some back-ups with you.
5,Sony DVD+RW for camcorders,"Great product, works perfect with the Sony camcorder. Great buy especially for my qualified free shipping!"
1,Warning: Does not work with Canon DC50 Camcorder,If you own a Canon Camcorder be forewarned that these disc's won't work in the Canon DC50 series mini dvd camcorders. The regular Sony DVD-R are kind of temperamental with the Canon camcorders as well (But fine if you are in pinch). I'll have to figure out what to do with these disc's now.
3,Works well. Used mostly as backup due to capacity,I bought this for my camcorder which supports both memory card and discs and I mainly use it if/when my memory gets full. I set up the video quality to the highest which gives me only 20 minutes on these discs so most of the time I just carry them around with me in case the memory gets full.
4,good but no remote was in the box,I like the camcorder but the remote control which was supposed to be included was not in the box.
2,"Shipping is not free, it is 8$",Now (Jan 2007) shipping is not free as claimed by the other reviewer. You are better of purchasing a similar product sold by Amazon itself. During shipping also it was not very clear about the shipping charge. They might have showed it. But I bought whole bunch of things in this order and missed it.
1,One of the Dvd doesnt work,"I bought this few weeks back, one of the dvd doesnt work in the camcorder, it doesnt even initiate to format..and gives an error..sent email to datavision..but they just told me that it will format in the camcorder,.,which is not working and there was no other reply for the email from them,,.l"
4,"Great Product, But Not The One Described in the Ad","Despite the product description, the product delivered (and intended to be delivered by the vendor) was DVD-RW single discs, not DVD+RW 3-discs"
4,Happy with the quality,Works good for taping and re using the disc for other videos.It's standard DVD quality but good for normal uses where you don't need HD.
3,Not quite what I was hoping for,"I gave this three stars because it's not an awful piece of jewelry, just not something that I like. The necklace is very shiny and bright, and the circle is very, very large. I suppose with the right outfit it would be great, but it's not casual enough to wear everyday."
4,RCA Broadway tunes,"Ten selections chosen from the RCA VICTOR showtunes archives. (Note that the KING AND I track is from the revival album, as is the KISMET selection.)PLAYLIST--42nd Street Overture - (from ""42nd Street"")Stranger In Paradise - Lee Venora/Richard Banke (from ""Kismet"")Send In The Clowns - Glenn Close (from ""A Little Night Music"")Shall We Dance - Constance Towers/Yul Brynner (from ""The King And I"")Bring Him Home - Colm Wilkinson (from ""Les Miserables"")Brotherhood Of Man - Robert Morse/Sammy Smith/Ruth Kobart/Company (from ""How To Succee In Business"")If I Were A Rich Man - Zero Mostel (from ""Fiddler On The Roof"")Honeysuckle Rose - Ken Page/Nell Carter (from ""Ain't Misbehavin'"")Hello Dolly - Carol Channing/Company (from ""Hello Dolly"")Music Of The Night, The - Colm Wilkinson (from ""Phantom Of The Opera"")"
5,"Not For Audiophiles, But Wonderful for the Rest of Us!","I thought that this disc was quite possibly the best attempt so far at cataloging some of the best themes of the film-noir genre. It leaves out the dialogue snippets that break up the feel and mood of the music, and some of the selections are, quite simply, marvelous. Also, the compilers here were brave enough to include some of the rarer and seldom-mentioned noirs for inclusion here. If you're an audiophile, you must realize that these recordings are SIXTY YEARS OLD, for goodness sakes. I'll never understand why some people put so much stake in stereo sound and crystal clear remastering. I happen to feel that the gritty mono (which really isn't nearly as bad as has been suggested) heightens the hardbitten feel of these works. So, if you're someone who enjoys authentic film music, give this a shot! If you're expecting something butchered, repackaged, and changed around for modern tastes, don't bother with this collection!"
2,It's at today missing for me.,"I am waiting this CD in my home. At today it's missing. Take note of this,please."
3,Skim on Postmodern thoughts??,"Look its not a great book what it does for the reader who wants basic concepts and will continue to look/read elsewhere is review some basic concepts. Not more and not even well. Postmodern thought requires time, research and some very expansive reading to discern and even then. I am not speaking to those who have just written it off. If you need some basic foundation to get on the page a place to begin but hardly a solid foundation. It's some veneer. Enough to allow the reader intimidated by the subject to begin reading somewhere."
5,PostmosernismS,"Really this book should be called PostmodernismS for beginners, because, as Powell points out--there is no single unified Postmodern movement. Rather it is a hodgepodge of influences from architecture, capitalism, technology, philosophy, and the arts that is changing our world. Powell delves into many of these Postmodernisms, in a readable and lucid way. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth the money ..,"I have had my hermit crabs for in excess of 8 years now . What I have found is that more often than not the products for these pets are over priced and of poor quality . Since boiling water is the preferred method of cleaning crabitat accessories I have often worried about the safety of reusing plastics. In response to this concern I started using small porcelain bowls . Small 'dipping sauce' bowls (or containers like the ones you see in restaurants that hold sugar packets) are easily pushed into the substrate to prevent tipping , can be washed repeatedly with no concern and MUCH less expensive . ($1.99 -3.99)"
5,da bomb,"this was a really good book.except Lisa,Carole, Ben,George,Callie,and Veronica seem to be the only ones with brains.I never thought I would actually say Veronica had a brain.Oh well,it's a small one anyway.This was a really good book."
2,Not Very Well Written,"I was really upset with how this book was written. The whole thing was based around one stupid party that in real life, probably lasted for all of two hours. I was disgusted with all the crazy stuff going on in everyone's lives. Lisa's 40 year old mother needs to get rid of her 24 year old boyfriend, and Lisa wouldn't be too bad off without her overprotective, posessive boyfriend, Alex. I mean, if Lisa even makes eye contact with some one who's cuter (and older) than Alex, he throws a fit and acts like a baby. I was also really mad at how everyone got so drunk. Most teenagers know when to say no, and I think that Bonnie Bryant was trying to use the fact that because two or three people were depressed, everyone got drunk. I really don't like how she writes teenagers off in this book as being depressed, terrible people."
3,Does this book make sense to anyone?,"This is a really interesting book, to say the least. The style of writing is exciting and keeps the pages turning. I'm not sure it makes very much sense, by the end. It skips around a bit, and there are two main stories within the story: a western, and a story about a boxer. Both of those stories are actually more interesting than the actual story, and I kept waiting to get back to those, which I'm not sure is good or bad. It's a good read, but really only if you have a lot of time. By the end, you're just thinking that there must have been a point in there somewhere."
2,Glad it was free,"A guy from NZ gave this to me at a hostel. In general, a waste of time & paper. Possibly a wonderous subtext exists in the original Italian, but it lacks purpose in English. I gave it to a Canadian guy after finishing it."
3,inspiration,"the only reason that i give this book 3 stars instead of 2 is because i was so inspired by this novel that i wrote the best poem of my life! i do not know why, but for some reason, (even though i did not understand how quickly the characters & the stories changed) i read 200 pages the first day. mon dieu! i just love how the man is so poetic, but the book really makes little sense..oh well. do not get this if you are not a fan of poetic writing."
1,Nothing but pure garbage,"Well, the title says it all. This book is completely worthless. A pathetic work from a pathetic author."
4,An eclectic mix,"This is a decently priced bundle, and all of the included movies seem to contain all of the extras and features of their individually packaged counterparts.For me, this bundle was a great deal since my children like all of the movies contained therein. I guess it's a bonus that I enjoyed three of the movies myself!"
1,not useful problems,Product was full of SW problems. Not usiable.Requires full SW updatge to be usefuldo not buy this product.
5,excellent,"I AM REALLY DELIGHTED WITH MY PURCHASE,HAVE BEEN SEARCHING A LONG TIME FOR IT. WILL BE USING AMAZON AGAIN."
3,Rebel on DVD,"Well, the only way in modern times to view this movie. Not available anywhere else it seems - no iTunes orother download and the only other copies seem to be on VHS (good luck with that).On the plus side - you get the movie and the great music.On the minus side this DVD is clearly copied / reproduced from VHS and the quality is poor.There is also NO way to extract the music as the encoding files do not exist separately."
1,Video was compleatly out of sinc,"Video was compleatly out of sinc, When the woman talked you heard the mans voice etc. I got my money back."
2,Masters Lost,"For those that need to know...original owner of Red Rhino went bankrupt many years ago just as CD's were coming in. There was a dust-up in court and he (apparently) absconded with all the master tapes never to be seen or heard of again. Hold onto your original vinyl copies of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, Punishment Of Luxury etc. There were 2 CD releases actually on Red Rhino by Red Lorry Yellow Lorry that appear to be taken from the masters RED CD 65 ""Paint Your Wagon"" and RED CD 86 ""Smashed Hits"" (Note: only original copies of ""Smashed Hits"" appear to be from the masters - subsequent releases of this collection by Dojo and Cherry Red are inferior copies from vinyl. I guess they couldn't find a copy of the original Red Rhino CD to copy.)Talk About the Weather"
1,Horrible sound and mastering from vinyl!,"Once again, Anagram/Cherry Red rip off their customers by selling CDs of music ripped from vinyl sources. It's lazy and downright criminal to put this out and not go to the effort of using the original master tapes, especially since the songs are properly licensed.Luckily, I was able to listen to the whole CD first, otherwise I'd have bought this turkey. Please refuse to stand for this kind of rip-off."
5,Not just for Kids!!!,"My 17 month old daughters LOVE these guys. Even more importantly, my husband and I love these guys too. It is a fun time for all 4 of us to sit around and sing along to their songs!!!"
5,A lot of fun...,"Hot Peas 'N Butter has a knack for language, beat, and just plain fun in this CD. Children as well as adults will enjoy listening."
4,Very Good Music That Really Brings Up Memories,"This music does a great job of what its supposed to do which is evoke in you certain emotions that correspond to certain parts of the film going on that they were written for, and Williams does a phenomenal job at that as usual. The Main Title is simply awesome, there is only one other sequence that has more memories associated with it for me and that's the main title to Star Wars another Williams hit. I must admit the whole ""Can You Read My Mind?"" thing is quite a bit cheesy but this album is still worth it for all of the rest of the songs. I always have fun trying to detect the different themes of each character and where they are woven into other songs, it takes a while but you can definitely do it."
5,It is SUPER!!!!!!!,I loved this maove and the music is what adds that little bit to make the movie spectacular! The opening score shows you that you are about to expierience a Legend.
5,It's Excellent !,"I bought this Superman original soundtrack to replace one I lost yrs ago so I knew it's excellent. ( I ONLY wanted it for the infamous theme song composed by John Williams ) This is a must have for Superman fans. I love it. 5 stars. The only glitch is 2 of the original recordings are omitted from this cd "" Growing Up "" and "" Lex Luther's Lair "". There are 14 compositions on the cd. I highly recommend any movie theme music by John Williams."
5,Takes me back.,"The original full length Superman movie was great (I saw it in the theatre, first run).The albumn takes me back, & the man theme is one of the most stirring pieces of music I've ever heard."
4,Online market research is moving fast,"The book is well organized and helpful. I would recommend that your read it fast though.The one short coming is that it is a print book about an online phenomenon. The methods seem to be changing very fast.Take for instance this new site,[...]. It seems like it will change the way most people do research online. Check out the link to the wireless telecom industry:[...]New tools, and new sites just seem to be coming out too fast for print media to keep up."
3,MTT leads an exciting but lightweight Klagende Lied with variable singers,"Although Mahler enthusiasts enjoy it, the youthful Klagende Lied hasn't found a concert audience--or much of one at Amazon, to judge by the lack of reviews for this CD. Tilson Thomas made it in 1997 when he was a PR darling in San Francisco, and it was a brave choice. His reading of the original three movements is crisply played and features a good deal of excitement, but it's all revved up on the surface. We get little sense of fantasy and mystery, which are crucial.Also, despite the lovely singing of a youthful Michelle DeYoung, the other soloists are variable--Leiferkus sings clotted German with a Slavic timbre, and the tenor, Thomas Moser, sounds strained and baritonal. This was the first Klagende Lied I ever heard, and I'm grateful to have moved on to more convincing versions, such as Boulez's 1970 recording on Sony."
5,Please bring this book back into print,"I read this book to my son (who is now 22 years old) when he was a baby probably beginning at 6 months of age and it was always his favorite. I would dearly love to see it reprinted and in hard bound version. I have tried to find it for grand nieces and nephews, but to no avail, over the last several years. It is pure delight!"
4,Regarding DeLonghi,"I have had a DeLonghi for several years now (different model). To be sure, I have had to replace the grommet and the stupid plastic ""crema maker."" I poked around in my phone book a bit, got the parts without problem. The plastic part broke again, but I find I really don't care -- it has no impact on the coffee."
1,Defective in a week,"I currently own a Briel which has been working fine and I thought I would try a DeLonghi in my summer home. The Delonghi broke on me in a week. Getting a new one shipped out and sending the broken one back was easy, but it was a week wasted."
4,De longi expresso maker,"Great and easy to use, However there is limited space between the filter head and the drip tray so only small cups will fit in the space."
5,The Best Espresso Machine!!,I bought my DeLonghi EC701 a year ago on EBay. It was a floor sample. I even purchased a 3 year warranty after reading the BAD reviews. This machine is the GREATEST! My espressos are very hot and the creme is outstanding! The frother works just as good. Nothing leaks or just breaks off. It is a high quality machine. I have owned Krups in the past. This machine beats them hands down. I am by no means sorry about my purchase. I haven't had one single problem. Want good espresso? This is the one for you!
2,"Sorry, just not that great","I'm totally for indie rock, and I gave this a chance, but it just plain isn't good. I had an inkling that it wouldn't when I realized one day that the songs (even by bands I love) produced by Calvin Johnson just end up sounding like crap. There's a Steve Albini kinda of raw, which I love; and his kind of raw, which is just not well thought out, lazy, unimaginiative, pretentious, technically inept, and basically without merit.The Beat Happening vocals are horrible, off key, the guitars are minisucle in the mix, the lyrics are just plain bad. Only good for pretentious white-bred suburban kids who pray that enjoying something ""different"" (nonlistenable) will make them different from the other kids at school. If you are one of these people, enjoy this music made by one of your own."
1,Very expensive,"$1/day on mouthwash?????? my dentist recommended it for my 3 kids. so i'm paying $1,100/yr for mouthwash!!No thanks.a tube of toothpaste is $4 and lasts 3-6 months."
1,Grossly overpriced - Buy the Wal-mart generic for $2.47,"It's no surprise that a dentist would recommend the outrageously overpriced Colgate product, since the reason for the high price was to put more money into dentists' investment accounts. Wal-mart's functional equivalent, Equate Anti-Cavity Fluoride Rinse, costs $2.47 for a 16 fl oz bottle. It carries the same seal of ADA approval as the expensive Colgate version and has the same concentration of fluoride."
1,Product expired two years ago!!!!,"I ordered Phos-Flur about two months ago and I was quite satisfied with the product. Since I moved to an area where water is not fluoridated, everyone at my family started having cavities, some of them for the firts time in their lifes.Sadly, I placed the next order from John Alexander Upperman through Amazon, and this order came in a different bottle, tasted different, and more importantly IT IS FROM A LOT THAT EXPIRED IN 2010!!!Being this a health product intended to be put in one's mouth, selling a product that's expired years ago is dangerously irresponsible. I used it a couple times before noticing the expiration date, I hope it doesn't have any adverse effects in my health. At the very least, it is likely not to be too effective given how quickly the active ingredients react."
5,Great Product,"My daughter just had braces put on and this rinse is the last step in our new nightly ritual of brushing her teeth. Not sure if it's doing any good but it makes me feel like I'm doing all I can to keep her from cavities. I haven't tried the other flavors but if this stuff wasn't at least tolerable, she would refuse to use it. A good preventative product."
3,as ordered; prompt delivery,"What can I say ? Fair price - The coveted bubble gum flavor - It showed up, in good condition, as requested.Thanks."
3,Ever Wonder where the Stuff went?,"If you're a fan of early Wonder Stuff, give this one a go. If you're a fan of Eat's ""Mr & Mrs Smack"" song, you may be surprised by the jangly energy and tunefulness of this disc. Really one of those that flew right under the radar."
3,High School Textbook,This is a somewhat dated (1994) high school textbook so the only reason to purchase it is if it is being used in your school district (less and less now) and you either need an extra copy or need to replace a copy for your school.If you are homeschooling and looking for a textbook there are others which are better - only reason to use this is if your local school district is using it and your child's peers are learning from it too.Chapter 4 on quadratics is fairly good. Chapter 5 on basic quadrilateral shapes has a great chart and overall structure although some of the questions are difficult to interpet. Chapter 6 is a nice introduction to combinatorics (combinations and permutations) and even goes up through the binomial theorem. Chapters 7 and 8 are the weakest on other geometric shapes and a really weak and confusing section on proofs.Overall an ok text but not great and it's now really past its prime.
2,Not even close to the original,"This live version of Mystére is a very commercial (read: dummied down) restatement of the original. The person who updated Kunya Sobé made this version faster and a better foot-tapping experience, but it had to sacrifice the great rifts to get there.If you discovered Cirque recently, it may not matter. On the other hand, if you really know Mystére and/or know a bit about music, listen before you buy or download!"
5,It's simply beautiful.,"This cd is amazing. I saw Cirque de Solei perform in Las Vegas, NV, and their show was just wonderful and very entertaining. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys upbeat instrumental music."
2,Erratic Lewis Comedy,"The uneven ""Which Way to the Front?"" (1970) has a few classic sequences featuring Jerry Lewis at his best. After a shaky start, the World War II farce improves when Jerry impersonates a Nazi officer - highlighted by his brilliant Chaplinesque ballet with Adolf Hitler. Though a tremendous hit in Europe, this Lewis effort was barely shown in America and marked the beginning of the comic filmmaker's 11-year Hollywood exile.OVERALL RATING: **"
5,good job,"the tape was in great shape , I will enjoy it for manny year to can. thank's for sending it to me . Art."
3,The Original Inglourious Basterds,"While the movie is uneven in its first half, it comes to life when Jerry disguises himself as one of Hitler's officers, providing some unforgettably laugh-out-loud funny moments."
1,WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT,"JERRY LEWIS USED TO BE A PRETTY GOOD, EVEN UNDER-APPRECIATED COMIC ACTOR. SOME OF HIS MOVIES (I.E. ROCK-A-BYE BABY & THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) ARE VERY MUCH WORTH WATCHING. BUT THIS DUD OF A MOVIE CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS, LAME, LAME, LAME! THIS MOVIE IS SO SILLY! NOT IN A CLEVER, FUNNY WAY, BUT IN AN, ""OH BROTHER"" WAY. AFTER THIS MOVIE JERRY STILL GOT SUPPORTING ROLES IN A FEW MOVIES (E.G. THE KING OF COMEDY), BUT THEY STOPPED MAKING ANY MORE ""JERRY LEWIS"" FILMS WITH JERRY AS THE COMIC LEAD. IF YOU CAN ENDURE THIS TURKEY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY."
3,Smaller than advertised,"This pop filter is advertised as being 3.8"" x 2.8"" x 3.8"", but the actual measurements are quite a bit smaller, slightly less than 3"" high x 2.3"" outside diameter, inside diameter about 1.3"" at the opening, a little bigger in the main part. The foam is about a half inch thick or slightly less. It covers a Shure SM58 or Carvin M68 sufficiently, but not anything larger."
5,Cheap and fits snug,"This fit over my mic perfectly and snug. For the price, I don't see why you wouldn't buy one of these for each of your mics that you own. I will buy again if mine wears or tears."
5,Cheap and works well,I've bought this windscreen for my Zoom H1 and it does the job nicely and I like the sound quality seems to almost the same with and without the windscreen.
4,Nice quality and fits my RODE Mic just fine,"What can you say about a Foam Ball type mic windscreen? Well it fits the RODE M1 Mic I was using nice and tight. Quality is good, didn't tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine."
3,Works,"I definately helps cut down ""wind whistle"" on my mic. can't say anything great about the product but I cant say anything bad. It does what it is suppose to"
4,All OK.,Quite good a function on Zoom H1 but tightly secured and requires attention not to lose. I advise to take just a few.
4,A Poor Man's Pop Filter,"I use an SM58S for recording so that should probably give you an idea of my budget. Mic placement is everything and for the most part I don't need this. For some situations it can be handy. Minimal loss in clarity - and it does stop a lot of those plosives. During long recordings, I seem to forget the mic is there so placement is forgotten. Talking straight into the cardiod isn't an issue as long as this is on.I did see images from others and yeah, its big and silly looking. Thankfully I am not doing karaoke with it."
5,Too good to pass up. Hard to get in stores.,This is my own personal foam ball. I got a blue one and a black one to distinguish the difference. Easy to clean and screens out noise this is a great tool for me to use. I am a speaker at various places and I need to have my own windscreen foam ball. It is great to have extras as well.
3,"Great Price! , Mediocre quality","It was shipped promptly! Cudos.It holds together quite nicely.However, the foam ball doesn't couple so well with a microphone for anytime of pop filtering.If you want high frequencies to bleed through to your microphone, look elsewhere...This foam ball will muffle your sound. It's about a half an inch think.I will not be using this for vocal miking as I had intended. I'll find some random use though."
3,Way too big for a Shure SM57. Glad I'll only be using at home.,"It does it's job. But it's like 3 times the diameter of the actual mic and it doesn't have a snug fit. It's incredibly goofy looking. I'm just glad I'm not the type to perform because i'd be embarrassed singing into this giant, black, irregular shaped blob on the end of my mic."
3,cheap quality,Hey its thin foam rubber-u get what u pay for-may keep the mic a bit dryer than without a cover
5,"On Stage Foam Ball-Type Mic Windscreen, Black","Arrived on-time, well packed, Quality it very good, So if your wanting to protect you mics i suggest you get this."
5,Amazing!,"Came way faster than i expected and great quality,I am so happy with this mic filter, i would definitely recommend it!"
1,buy a better light,The light only hits the top of the page. The bottom of the page in the dark. The light clamps directly to the top of the stand. There is no adjustment. Get a better light.
4,Manhassett 1000 music stand lamps,"Manhassett 1000 music lamp so far the lamps are working out great! We have been very pleased the light is bright enough to actually see what is on your stand and read it! Some of the other smaller lights we have purchased for music stands are not even bright enough to read what is on your stand if the room is dark, but the Manhassett 1000 are working very well, if they last a long time I will give them a 5 star! Decent price too."
5,Great for blemishes,Md formulations is great for blemishes and it does not completely dry out you skin. I would recommend it for anyone who has occasional breakouts.
5,James Stewart - An Apostle for Our Generation,"This is the one book that will bring the church back to life - back to the path to reaching a lost world. James Stewart makes us gospel-centered and therefore truly Christ-centered. This is the book that could give us the one true revival that the church has so desperately longed for. Nothing is so critical in this hour as `A Faith to Proclaim'.Although the book was written over fifty years ago, it bears the testimony of Christ on a level perhaps unrivalled in modern times. To my knowledge no book so passionately points to the fulfillment of the Great Commission. James Stewart, like Abel, though he be dead, yet lives among us and still speaks to our generation. Those who love the gospel will also appreciate a literary style that truly makes the English language live!"
5,One of my favorites,This was one of my favorite books as a child. I wish they would put it back in print in hardcover so I could get copies for my friends' children.
4,Illustrations Amazing but Text Stilted,"I totally agree with other reviewers that the illustrations are totally awesome. But the text attempts too hard to stay true to the earliest versions of these tales so as to make it difficult to read out loud to small children. In some cases, things only made sense when we referred back to some of the European language versions from my wife's childhood. I'm not suggesting references to wicked step-mothers trying to have their step-children offed be removed. And maybe the writers are reacting to the overly PC/Disney-sanitized for your protection trend. I am referring more to story flow. Just as much of the magic of the story can be conveyed through sounds and rhythms as much as the illustrations and accuracy. At the end of the day, I would still highly recommend to others: Just make sure you read it to yourself first and transliterate with spirit when reading out loud to eager young ears."
3,"Very Nice book, but not meant for 4 year olds...","I really like this book. The stories are classic though changed a bit on a few of them. The illistrations are beautiful....my son loves looking at the pictures. BUT..... the wording is to complicated for a 4 year old. My son was getting bored because he wasn't understanding alot of it. So I started reading the book and changing the wording so he could understand it. Not exactly my idea of fun reading. It's still a good book, just for older kids."
5,Practically perfect in every way,"I have always loved fairytales more than any other genre, and picked up this book for my four year old son. I was pleasantly suprised with the beautiful illustrations and their enduring attention to detail. The text is a bit old-fashioned, which I think is a good thing- it makes me feel like we've transported to the time when the story is taking place. My son sits still for long stretches of time while I read the stories to him- a huge feat for a four year old.I love this book- and I would recommend it to anybody with small kids."
5,Beautiful Book,"I searched everywhere for a book of Fairy Tales. They just didn't seem to exist anymore! I finally found this one. It is beautiful. Big bright pictures, and the stories are just like I remember them from when I was a little girl."
5,A master illustrator,"Scott Gustafson is one of our greatest illustrators and shows his particular gift in creating illustrations that will delight children and the child in all of us lucky enough never to have completely grown up. Every child should experience this book--at least at the library, and if they are lucky, on their own bookshelfs--whether your chronological age or your eternal child age qualifies you."
2,Poor story composition,"I was excited to get this book for our two 5 year old boys. The illustrations are, as noted in other reviews, excellent. However, the stories leave a lot to be desired. In my opinion, they are too complicated and poorly structured. Others have mentioned that the stories are too long for this age. I agree with that but I think the bigger problem is that they are just badly written and edited. I'll be looking elsewhere for a good collection of classics. Disappointed."
4,good -- worth the purchase,"The book is good, fun, etc... The pictures (drawings) are great. The negative is that it's a bit difficult to read out loud. I find myself stumbling as I expect one word, but another is in front of me. Not a huge deal, but it makes it tough to read, and I think it must make it a bit tough for the kids to listen to.I wish it included a few more tales, and maybe excluded a couple. It's worth the money, and the kids like it."
5,Classical beauty,"Those ancient tales are presented in perfect harmony with lavish, fine oil paintings that evoke classical masterpieces, to indulge in fantasy and beauty - all, big and small."
5,Classic Fairy Tales by Scott Gustafson,The pictures in this book are absolutely inspiring and beautiful!The story line is a little bit different from the normal expected talehowever it makes for good attention getting from younger ones.Also this is a first edition.
3,Uninspiring Book,"The title of the book is very misleading. It is not step-by-step, but more like skip a step and try and figure out how we did this. Not that great. Better books out there."
4,The machines are blinking,"You can tell just from the track titles what genre of music you'll hear on Groovetechnology: electro house with its roots in Kraftwerk. If you love bleeps, you'll love this."
3,Review of Anniversary Recording,"Honeytree has a wonderful voice and her sons contain great lyrics. I love her earlier recordings because they are full of life and very uplifting. I was somewhat disappointed in the 20th Anniversary Recording, as I believe it lacked the same zeal and enthusiasm, which her earlier recordings had. However, you may thoroughly enjoy her 20th Anniversary Recording - so I don't want to dissade you. I recently bought Evergreen - songs I listened to many years ago, and love this CD. I would highly recommend Evergreen over 20th Annniversary Recording - but if you have a chance to listen to some of the songs on 20th Anniversary - do so and make your own decision either way on it. :)"
4,good read,I just got done reading this. I would say that this book should be required reading for anyone considering a life in the biomedical sciences. One star off because I thought chapter two was a bit tiresome.
4,Nobel Prize,"Professor Peter C. Doherty was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine with Swiss colleague, Rolf Zingerngel, in 1996 for discovering `the nature of the cellular immune defence', and was also recognised as Australian of the Year in 1997.Brief history of Noble Prize/s and autobiography of his childhood. Technical in places on immunology. A very informative read."
5,Use Your Own Imagination Room,"If you are having any sort of marital stress or problems at work or you just can't seem to control your temper you need to read this book!The author teaches a tecnique on how to use your thoughts and imagination to help eliminate bad feelings as they are occuring and turn them into positive, productive feelings.He helps you understand that the bad feelings that you have at the time they are happening are not really YOUR feelings. They are not what you WANT to feel. They are a product of your circumstances and your environment (what he calls ""your Freddy"" -- read the book).These feelings are not what you want and this book will help you to properly react to these feelings.I have had the priviledge to meet the author and he is a really wonderful, unique individual who is very insightful and really understands what makes people tick.This is a defenite read!"
5,Awesome boots.,"I love these boots! Very comfortable and durable, seem to work well with any outfit. I wear these almost every day now."
4,This is a wonderful book full of inspirational stories.,O.k....I know you've heard alot about angels and how unusual and wonderful things can happen to everyday people. This book showed so many examples of how peoples lives are being altered by the sight and voices of angels.Now I'm a little predjudice towards this book because....I had one of my stories accepted into her book. I feel so priviledged to be a part of such an inspiring book!
4,Rare Promo Disc,"This is a 3-song promo disc which was sent to radio stations to promote the (then) forthcoming full-length album ""Yibe!"". There was a limited press run, and almost all of them were originally given away for promotional purposes, although a few of them were sold in the band's hometown area of Washington, DC. Two of the songs, ""Puppets & Dolls"" and ""Knowledge is a Knife,"" were edited down to radio-friendly lengths for this disc, as the full-length versions which appear on ""Yibe!"" were a little on the long side.A fun trio of songs that show off the versatility of a band whose chief criticism was that they couldn't be categorized."
3,Low Energy,"It has been years since I heard ""Les Petits Riens"" on our local classical music radio station and even harder finding a decent recording of the work. This performance is serviceable but lacks power and energy. It's fine for now but I will continue to look for a better recording down the line."
1,Poor recorded sound and lack of idiomatic feel!,Very four square Mozart out here...rather bland and lacking vitality. Surely the Naxos folks could have found better recordings to release from the Historical archives. These are simply straightforward interpretations with little feeling.
1,"crappy plastic, cheaply made","Luckily I bought this item on sale, it was like $10. It was probably made for .30. It fell apart the first time I used it. Poor quality. On top of that, Amazon shipped it to the wrong address, so it took forever to get. Don't buy this. Spend the extra $5 and get it from the manufacturer OR spend less and get it from the dollar store (it'll be the same quality)."
1,County jail video project,"Poorly executed.The entire DVD was done with the guy dressed in county jail orange uniform (I kid you not).All screen backgrounds of the presentations are done in painful bright orange.""Dude. Let's make a video, I have a camcorder. Dude. Ya. And let's make it orange.""I would say that about sums it up."
4,Alkire's third book is her best yet...,"Alkire's best work to date. An easy-to-read, ecumenical book with practical applications. There are real stories and examples that just about anyone can identify and relate to. A real ""Chicken Soup for the Healing Soul"" if you will, minus the fluffy commericialism."
5,Works for Me,"I purchased the One-Step kit to compare the readings from two hygrometers made by different companies. It worked as advertised, allowing me to determine which of the two was most accurate. The product is simple to use, and I assume more reliable than the old ""salt test."" I do agree with another reviewer that the bag provided is a bit small - only big enough for compact cigar and guitar hygrometers. Still, it provided the information I wanted with a minimum of fuss. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs accurate humidity readings."
2,No good for me,I had two hygros in the kit and both read 60% after the time was up. I did the salt method (salt and tiny bit of water in a plastic dish inside of ziplock bag) then placed the 2 hygros in and they both hit 75% within 6 hours. Maybe I just had a bad Boveda kit?
4,One step humidity calibration,"The item appears to work as directed. It is contained in a quite small plastic bag, which will only hold the smallest of hygrometers. I observed that the hygrometer was initially showing a positive error of about 7%, but after the recommended calibration time of 24 hours the hygrometer reading was right on the mark. This variation troubled me, but perhaps the calibration is temperature sensitive, although the whole unit was at a reasonably constant room temperature during the whole calibration process."
4,The safest way to calibrate your hygrometer,"Using the salt method seem cheaper, but this is extremely easy to use and very accurate.The best of all is that it is by far safer!"
4,Manual humidity calibrator envelope,"I used this envelope to calibrate a humidity meter, which was easy.Anyone can use this item."
3,Couldn't tell if it worked or not-had a bad hydrometer,I could not get my original hydrometer to work properly so I purchased a new digital version instead. I can't say whether or not this product worked.
1,Bad bag,Seems the humidipak was expired somehow had to buy another one from a different brand to attempt to calibrate my hygrometer which seemed to work well. DO NOT BUY.
5,Worked!,"Worked great. Did exactly what it was supposed to do. One note, it is a small-ish bag. Definitely not all hydrometers will fit. I used a XIKAR Digital Round Cigar Hygrometer 832XI though and it fit not problem. Could have put a few in but that hydrometer is small."
5,Works like a champ,"Have used these beauties to calibrate 4 hygrometers, both digital and analog. Could not be simpler to use. Gives you a very consistent 75.5% every time."
1,Total waste of money,"Thought this would be the solution - bad decision. The rubber handle fell off as soon as I open the package which made me wonder about the quality of the product. Then I tried to open a jar lid, which didn't work. This product is a total waste of money and very poorly made. Very disappointing......."
1,A JOKE!,"I bought this item in order to open a large jar of marinated artichokes I bought at Costco. This opener was of no use in trying to open the jar. It just isn't designed to open a large jar lid. A neighbor showed me how to rap the jar, upside down on the sidewalk, breaking the vacumn and letting the lid twist and release easily. This gadget is a total waste and a rip-off."
5,Clever Design,The idea of this Jar Opener is that it squeezes the jar lid thus breaking the vacuum seal. Then the leverage applied by the opener easily opens the jar. It is true that the vacuum seal on a jar can be opened by rapping the side of the jar on a hard object such as the side of a table but this device is so much more eloquent!
4,works but clumsily,"These things work ok for me, but, they might have been better if the ""teeth"" parts that contact with the jar lid edges had rubber or something to give them a better less slippery grip on the lid. It's a little clumsy getting the tool into position and then it doesn't lock down very tightly, so, it's a bit of a hack getting the lid off no matter how I try. It DOES help however, so it's better than nothing, and better than trying to smack the lid open with a knife on the edge.For older people with much weaker hands than mine (I have arthritis, but I know people much worse off), I don't know if this would help all that much compared to the under-counter V shaped type of openers or the motorized gadgets that are out there nowdays. For someone with truly limited use of hands, I'd find something better than this device."
2,Is it just me?,"Afer reading a review on this product on Cooks Illustrated and reading the high reviews here on Amazon, I decided to order. Maybe it's just me, butt I couldn't open the first jar I tried it on. I have arthritis and can't grrip too hard anymore. One of the reviews I read was from someone with the same problem. That's what sold me. The main problem I found was this: You need to squeeze the grip perpendicular to the way you exert pressure on the lid. This results in having to put pressure on your wrist sideways and squeezing at the same time. Anyone that has used a pair of pliers knows that it's easier to squeeze in the direction you have to turn the pliers. So, for me at least, it's back to the drawingboard. The ajr of corn I tried to open when I got these is still in the refridgerator - unopened."
3,"Amco Swing-A-Way 711BK Comfort Grip Jar Opener, Black","It is just ok, Can't compare to the original one it is styled after. Would not buy again. It is cheaply priced and cheaply made."
2,No No Nanette,I have had a better product at one time. It got lost in the shuffle of my moving. I hoped this would be a good replacement . It definitely has not been. Disappointed is what I got.
5,Works Great!,"I have small hands, and although I'm strong, I always have issues opening larger jar tops. This product works well and I haven't found a jar yet that it doesn't work on."
3,Not as good as my old one!,"I ordered this because it was a similar design to the one I used for the last sixty years. The old one, a copper-washed, no-brander from the dime store, finally gave up the ghost. I suspect one of my menfolks used it for some improper prying! The new jar opener does not grip as well, possibly because it is half the width of my old one, and the comfort grip had to be trimmed to fit properly. I hope I can learn to use this better, 'cause the web didn't show me anything better!"
3,Could be better,It openes most jars BUT also pinches your hand when you squeeze down on the handle.The same protective coating which is on the lower part of the handle should also be on the top of the handle part.
5,Great product,"Just like the many other reviews said, this Amco Swing-A-Way Jar Opener really works great. It opens the lid easy, it is durable, it requires little effort.....I bought this for my wife - she loves it. (And for me - I now can easily open any jar...) We've had it now for 3 years, it should last many more years. Solid construction. Still works perfect."
5,Great gadget,I received a similar jar opener 43 years ago at my wedding shower. It's the best at opening any size bottle or jar. I've been looking to buy some for my daughters and was delighted to finally locate them. A great gadget!
2,Just OK,"This product worked OK for my husband but really didn't work for me with my arthritis. Too much adjusting to get it to fit on the jar and then turn, plus the handle dug into my palm when turning. The Jar Key works so much better with less effort."
1,Disappointed in my purchase,"From its picture I thought it was like one I had years ago. Sadly, it is a poor imitation. It is quite flimsy, and I don't believe it will last very long."
2,not quite what I expected,"I bought three of these, one for me and two to give to relatives. I still have three since I think my kids might be insulted by such a gift. It is difficult to adjust and must span across the top rather than around the top (as a pipe wrench might do). Once obtaining a grip on the top, pushing or pulling pressure twists the grip handles. I could explain better with pictures, but suffice to say a cheap pipe wrench will make a better addition to your kitchen equipment."
2,Not the Swing-A-Way Quality I once knew,I have owned a Swing-A-Way manual can opener for over 30 years and it has worked flawlessly. This Jar opener is another story. During it's first use the black handle constantly slipped off while trying to grip the jar lid. After using the opener I rinsed it under warm water dried it and placed it in the dish drainer. The next day I noticed rust spots on the jar opener. After just one use? The opener also came with labels/stickers that were near impossible to remove. This is just not the quality I had hoped for from Swing-A-Way.
2,Not so great,"This has the feel, look and sound (it rattles quite a bit) of cheap-o workmanship....it was made in China. And, it is awkward to use because when the end is placed at the lip of the lid the handle does not slide back easy since a notch on the handle is automatically struck in one of the many slots above it. When you raise the handle to get the notch out of the slot, the end you put on the edge of lip comes off.I tried it on a lid I had already opened and put back on tightly and it worked fine once I finagled the handle back. Will wait and see when I try it on a toughie. Would have preferred to have purchased the more common lid opener."
2,Not really worth it,Doesn't really work. Save your money. Seems like a good idea. The gripper pads I used to have worked much better. Wish I could find more of those.
5,jar opener,This is the best jar opener. In the past I have purchased countless jar openers but none did the job. This one is ultimately the best on the market to date.
2,Not that easy,I don't find this as easy to use as other reviewers have stated.It is difficult to get adjusted just right in order to open jarseasily. I'm a little disappointed in this product..
4,Does a decent job,I had used this trimmer for about two years till the battery finally wouldn't recharge. It did an above average job of catching the trimmings but none of the trimmers in this category catch em all. I only used it for trimming my beard so I had no problems with the design. It was a little bulky for my travel pouch. Overall I was pleased with this trimmer and am looking forward to purchasing the latest model from Norelco - probably the T980... turbo vacuum!!! :)
2,norelco accuvac beard and moustache trimmer t970,"i have been using a norelco beard & moustache trimmer t860 for over 4 years.the shaver felt good in the hand. substantial. it always gave me a great shave.the electrical charge cord was standard electrical wire w/ a two prong plug. worked like a good slant-6. due to problems w/ recharging the battery, i decided to try a more upscale model.the t980 felt like a kids toy. the shave wasn't any better than the t860.the charger system consisted of a heavy transformer w/ a thin cord. didn't make for light travel packing. with me, less is more. there were to many so called features that could go the way of planned obsolescence."
2,Give me a Break,"I am a Doors fan. I love the Doors. I am rating the DVD, not the group. My opinion is that this DVD has a great documentary of the group. However, the reason why I purchased the DVD was because of the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround recording. Once I purchased the DVD and listened in my surround sound system, I became very dissapointed of the sound. The sound really sucked. My AM kitchen radio sounded better than the DVD. I am not taking away the content of the DVD which is excellent. The sound is just poor for 5.1 Dolby Digital."
4,can you say this is not good?,"all i can say is that is is the doors live, this is the way they appeard during this performance, the sound quality may not be as good as expected, but i still think it captures the moment of the doors, i recently bought the CD of the Doors called Live In Hollywood and that was exceptional sound and for me and exceptional experience, i love the doors and anything live from them is a different experience, depending on how much you relate to the doors. as far as i know i would realy like to experience anything from the live or not, just to enrich my mind and maybe make me feel a little diffrent in the expectations of what i expect from a band a great as they are."
3,Not a bad documentary...,"a good chronical (sp) of the Doors in London, England. And a good doc about the acid rock scene in the UK (Doors and the Jefferson Airplane co-headlined through the UK). Problem was, Jim Morrison was not dead yet.Yes, I used to idolise this guy, and then I grew up. Jim Morrison would have been remotely interesting if he wasnt so drunk. Singers are suppose to sing IN KEY AND IN TIME. Morrison does neither. A good frontman interacts with the audience, not stare blankly into the darkness. Thank goodness for Robbie Krieger, Ray Manzarek and John Densmore for being able to carry the songs through when Morrison was too distracted, too wasted, or too disinterested to sing (yes, you get it all in this DVD).If youre a fan, this is for you. If you want to know about the Doors, buy a studio album and read a bio. Dont waste your time and $$$ on a video."
2,Very disappointed,"As a huge Jim Morrison fan, I was so excited about purchasing this DVD. Unfortunately, the sound was awful (low grade) and the news footage took away from the music. I was hoping for more interviews, and clips of Jim and the boys, but they're weren't many. I wouldn't have wasted my money if I had known."
4,A great buy for a Doors Fan,"I bought this DVD today and popped it into my player as soon as I got home.After hearing the first few seconds of the song I thought damn this is going to be another compilation of songs from diff concerts. I was wrong and it's a full yet short show. At first I thought man sound quality is horrible, but I got use to it. I thought to myself the quiality is exceptionale. The document footage of Presidents and riots are intresting, but the only flaw is that the footage cuts in and you miss parts of a song. If your'e a true Doors fan you could over look these flaws. All I have left to say is get the orig 6 albums, In Concert and The Doors Collection DVD and you'll be set till Bright Midnight releases another Doors concert or live DVD."
1,REALLY?,How in the heck do you justify that price? You should pray for forgiveness as most who should watch this....never will.
5,Lets never forget!,Excellent exposee of the unfortunate situation in the history of the developmentally disabled. Great training film for new nurses unaware of the history
3,Good.,Definitely worth the time spent watching .. however the description is not good and I was expecting something different. Good time filler if you just need something to watch.
2,I didn't like it,"But I really wanted to!! I never had the emotional reaction that some other reviewers had - yes, it was interesting but it focused more on the families & not on the institution itself."
4,Love all three Volumes,"I own all three Thongs volumes. I listen to them all frequently. Each has its own flavor. Vol three has some songs that make me want to sell it all and move somewhere warm. If you enjoy Buffett-esque music, these albums are for you."
5,Excellent! Moving and Reflective!,"This inspired me tremendously helping me to get in touch with my deepest feelings. I have loved and lost, but I love again.... I laugh, cry and relate to all the author brings to me. It's wonderful and journey..."
5,"Beautiful, inspiring Book and beautiful, Music","This beautiful book has really helped me in my time of need. The pictures and poems and the way the author is able to move your heart and get your emotions fine tuned. Is is for everyone that has a question about true love. It is a book that will have you coming back for more! I use it as a meditation book and listen to the music walking along the ocean front. I love this book and it has truly opened my heart and given me strength, hope, yet some tears, keeps my heart in check. The music is great, my favorite song ""True Love"", then Time For A Change, Should Find, So Sorry, Broken Heart, High on A MT., Day By Day, Hey they are all fine! You won't be sorry, in purchasing this book, I wasn't!"
4,Review,"Gitta Sereny is an excellent author. Yes, as mentioned in the other reviews this is a collection of her work. What I enjoyed about this book is that it touches so many different facets of the Third Reich and how it still resonates in society today.Reading this for someone who is interested in this period is an excellent way to end up going off on different tangents from the mainstream books on the subject. I ended up reading books on what it was like growing up as a child of the Reich. From there I went on to read about the effects of the post-war population movements had on the demographic makeup of Europe. Read it and see what you never thought of before."
3,Definitely Maybe,"Mr. Branden spends a large section of the book going over identifying the mental issues in playing tennis. This is done well however, actually finding solutions is not done clearly at all.The best part of the book were the simple tips such as putting more height on the ball over the net, getting one more ball back and improving just one shot in your repertoire.This isn't a bad book but there are better books out there that have worked out much better for me. I would recommend Total Tennis by Peter Burwash and Bill Tilden's How to play better Tennis. The subject matter is different and I feel they have more value."
2,Great Bathroom Reading,"Yes, exactly that. Braden produces an easy-to-read book that dips into a bit of almost everything tennis except strokes. So he covers physics, genetics, statistics, psychology, great tennis personalities, finding a coach, tennis parents....ummm, yes, you got it. It's not so much about the mental side of tennis as a collection of tennis television commercials that every now and then touch upon the mental side of the game. So it goes alongside my people magazine (Vic is a marvelous rambler!) into the bathroom. And even when it covers the mental side, it is not very practical. There are other books that cover the mental game much better (e.g., Inner Game of Tennis, Zennis, Smart Tennis, etc). Still it is well-written and enjoyable and more decorative than potpourri by the bath."
1,Another rotten bad Maxi from No Talent Brian!,"This release is another shocking bad release from this no talent Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden. The songs on this maxi, similar to his so rotten bad Album ""irish son"" are absolutely vomiting, and cant be described as descent music at all - Totally uninspirational,rotten depressing, and totally dull. Totally awfully bad lyrics beyond comprehension, bad music, and Brian's so bad voice, showing he got no talent at all. So I give this 1 Star, though this is worth 0 Stars at all. So please, if you want real good music, please skipp this Release as well as the others, as there is a lot of good singers like ""Darren Hayes"" that are worth buying and listening too, but this Brian McFadden, no thanks!"
2,Poor Quality,This reel is made out of thinner metal than some of the other reels I have used. The two reel ends on my unit I recieved were bent or wavey. This made it difficult to roll the film up without over lapping or kinking. The clip attached to the center of the reel is poorly designed and hard to use if your hands aren't small. I would not recommend this unit to the amateur or professional photographer.
1,WOW HORRIBLE.,"I've been developing 35mm black and white film for a few years using the steel reels provided at my school. At my new school, we are supposed to purchase our own reels and so I walked down to Adorama one day and bought these figuring they were pretty inexpensive and probably not the worst.HOW WRONG I WAS.They suck. Really, really, really badly. Please don't buy these. They screw up my film."
1,beware,These reels are frequently bent and will either cause your film to wind on the spool wrong or allow your film to move around in the tank. I dont recommend these at all.
2,It will probably work,"This type of reel will do the job, and it will work the same way every time and stand up to a lifetime of use. The only problem is that stainless reels are not made to the most exacting mechanical standards, and you will rarely find one that works well out of the box. If the reel is deformed by a few hundredths of an inch, it can be maddeningly difficult to wind film on it in the dark without the film jumping tracks and doubling over.The reel I purchased works fine for twelve-exposure reels, but not for anything larger.If you get one that's not bent, or if you take the time to straighten a bent one, it will work every time. But for your time and effort it may be a better idea to get a Patterson tank combo. You'll break the plastic reels occasionally, but they're cheap to replace."
4,Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water-from beginners to advanced,"I would recomend this book to anyone looking for a comprehensive and easy to read text about toxic cyanobacteria. Chorus and Bartram have managed to fit together a great deal of very informative notes by many different authors in a format that progresses naturally from basic concepts of cyanobacteria and their helpful/harmful effects to what can be done to monitor, and manage them. Wheter you are just becoming interested in cyanobacteria or lake health, or have been studying it for many years, this book should be part of your collection. The section on analytical methods for cyanobacteria provide excellent basic methodology in this area, but anyone wishing to undertake detailed analysis not from scratch would also be well off searching published methods in scientific journals as they will not find all the nitty gritty details they will need."
2,Disappointed in cross-selling,"I feel ripped off.I got this book because I am on a yeast- and gluten-free program. What a disappointment to find out that meal plans include recipes not included in this book, but from Kornblum's and Semon's other books.I also agree with other readers that a plain baked potato or a salad with a lemon juice and oil dressing are no-brainers...but would understand if this was a ""go to"" book for other reasons.But it isn't. Other readers: beware that unless you have the authors' other books, you just won't see the benefit in this one."
1,"Unless you want to lose your data, don't buy this.",My son was using it for school and it has just completely stopped working.
3,The Best of HD DVD - Action (Troy Director's Cut / Blood Diamond / Wyatt Earp / Alexander Revisited The Final Cut) [HD DVD],"I was delighted when I saw HD has issued a set of 4 movies into this Best of HD DVD - Action and I at last decided to buy it, although with difficulty as one of them been bought earlier. However, all of them are superb with picture quality especially Troy which I like most, particularly the battle scene was very cleared and the sound is well mixed and dimensional.Despite the above comment on movie review, I have the chance to play both HD and Blu-ray discs, I think blu-ray has done it better in term of picture and sound. I would be glad if HD would improve in the long run."
4,excellent,"the watch is a tad heavy at first, but easily gotten used to. the all silver look is unique and grabs people's attention for sure, I've had many curious people ask to check it out. the only thing i was annoyed with at first but have come to look past is that fish-eye lens over the date window blocks the 3 o'clock number. why design something that disrupts your ability to view the actual purpose of a watch? who knows... but I don't mind it anymore. the eco-drive seems to work well, it charged in a short time in direct sunlight when i first unpacked it, and i have not had to pay any special attention to make sure it has been keeping charged during the past 2 months."
4,Useful for firstime hobby in Polymer clay,This was one of my first polymer clay books. I found it useful but not very inspirational. It is more for someone wanting to practice the art of Polymer clay as a hobby and not as an artform.
3,wish it was easier to put together and brighter,"I toddler had a huge smile on her face when she first saw the chair in her room, hence the 3 stars. However, it did take me awhile to put the capsule together when I first received it, and I am usually very handy when it comes to things that requires assembly. The 2 parts keeps slipping off when you trying to push them together to lock. Anyway, took me awhile.Also I wish the chair itself is less transparent in color, I think it would look a lot cuter if the color was more solid bright orange, but that is just subjective from my part. The color itself is quite similar to the picture advertised on site though."
2,Product is awful,"Two main flaws which caused me to return the product:1) Interface is shoddy at best. I was never able to start a drill lesson in the middle by skipping pages. If I returned to a prior lesson, I had to click on answers in order to advance, instead of being able to move forward as the interface supposedly should work.2) Much more importantly, there were grammar mistakes in the product. My wife is native Korean. During the first lesson, the product tries to teach you the words/concept of ""above"" and ""underneath"". My wife and 4 of her friends who are also native Koreans all listened to the drill and they all said that the phraseology would never ever be spoken by a Korean. They said that the phrasehology was actually incorrect.Other than that, while I echo the other comments about the navigation being unclear, I did think that the drills would help one learn vocabulary words."
2,Marginal Interface and Hard copy Materials,"This program completely lacks a structured approach to learning the Hangul alphabet and completely lacks the ability to teach ANY Hangul using the keyboard. Some of their other programs have this ability, but not the Korean one.Also, the teaching approach is completely by example using photos with no explanation of sentence structure, culture, etc. If you wanted to use it and repeat the lessons over and over and over you could probably learn the material, but the overall interface on the thing is lacking."
4,A great tool for learning Korean,"This program is has been working very well for me. Though it is level 1, it does help if you have previous experience with the Korean language or at least some supplemental materials. There are no lessons for leaning the Hangul, the Korean writing system. It helps greatly if you already know this before hand.Learning vocabulary and basic grammatical patterns goes quickly because of the Rosetta Stone method of learning intuitively. This program is great for learning a language as long as it is supplement with other materials."
3,Inadequate,"I received it last night and took it for a test drive. Right away it expects you to start pronouncing Korean Words.How can they possible expect someone to pronounce words correctly if one does not even know the sounds of the alphabets.I think this software will be helpfully but you MUST have a solid foundation, and by foundation I mean know all the sounds of the Korean alphabets; vowels and consonants."
5,A provocative look at where the markets are heading.,"This book has none of the typical drivel and conventional wisdom that pervade most investment books. Leeb's analysis of the critical and often overlooked relationship between the investment markets, technology and the economy are fascinating and convincing, and very likely will prove prescient as well. A must read for all long-term investors."
4,outdoor usage?,The cable coating gets scratched up very easily. For an outside extension cord that is unusual in my opinion.
2,You can do better,The item received was way less than 50 feet at a cost of $17 and some change. Went to local Home Depot and bought a 100 feet cable at $16. You can do better shopping locally and not ordering this product.
5,no compliants.,we have it to use with our weed eater. it's a good cord and i have no complaints. we left it out for christmas lights too.
3,It's an extension cord,It is an extension cord. It transfers electricity from the outlet to whatever you have plugged into it. Wow. It does a good job though.
1,didn't work,this cord didn't work at all. i think it was the person i bought it from rather than the cord itself.
1,Complete FAIL,"This extension cord is defective, it did not work at all! Very annoying as I purchased it to go with the leaf blower. My husband is a specialist in electronics for the military and has been so for close to forty years. We tested the blower and cord with other items and found the cord to be the problem. He diagnosed the plug to be the problem and replaced it himself. If I didn't happen to be married to him I would have had to waste the money to ship it back and it's heavy. Product testing should be done before these get sent out. grr!"
1,Defective after one use,I tried using this cord with my new 3.5A hedge trimmer. It worked for about 20 minutes and then stopped. I didn't open this until about a month after buying so I could not return it. Could possibly have just been a defective cord but I will not take my chances again.
5,Very sturdy,Great price and made with thick outer layer of protection. I recommend this if your looking for something inexpensive! Nice.
4,Coleman 6/13 vinyl outdoor ex.,"did the job for my electric lawn mower ,once you get use to the cord.had no problem with the power,I would recommend for equipment needing an outdoor ex. Cord."
4,Nice!,Just got arrived. looks like it'll hold up for the varried usage they'll get by me. I would say they seem to be worth the money!
1,Not as Described - This is NOT a 13Amp Cord!,"The description for this extension cord says it's 13Amp. It's not. It's 10amp. Coleman's cords of 0-50 feet are 13Amps, and 50-100 feet are 10Amps. This is a problem if you wanted to use the cord to run something like a leafblower, as I did."
1,A smoking cord :(,"I purchased this cord for outdoor use with a blower, trimmer, etc - very basic items. Much to my dis-may this cord is smoking at the point where you attach it to the item being used. I would not recomend buying this item."
1,The end burned up after 5 minutes of use,Plugged in my electric drill and after a few minutes I smelled something burning and it was where I plugged in the drill. I unplugged it and couldn't plug it back in because the cord blackened up and was full of black stuff. Real frustrated because I needed that cord to reach something in the back yard!!!
4,Works,Works but sun bleaches easy. Mine turned yellow lol. No other problems yet and have had it for six months
4,time will tell,"It's a good cord; came as advertised, I would buy another If I needed it.(Amazons ""five more words required"" is a stupid request, I don't need 1 more word)"
5,"Exellent, especially for the price","This item is pretty standard but I rate 5 stars for price, quick delivery, and for medium+ duty it is pretty flexible and easy to handle."
3,Loose-fitting,This cord serves its purpose but the plug seems to be a little loose in the outlet. It doesn't fall out on its own but it has come unplugged while I was doing yard work a few times if I put just a small amount of tension on the cord.
4,Should have bought the 50'.,The cable is slightly stiff. Otherwise seems sturdy. Only other problem was that 25' was too short for my application.
1,I don't think so.,Comparing Peter Serkin to Glenn Gould is like comparing your high school baseball team to the New York Yankees. They're in completely different leagues.
2,"Not bad, not good, but not much else available!","Although Young is very difficult to pin-down, both musically and philisophically, I expected Downing to provide more insight into the man and his music. Besides providing info on Young's ill children and marital history and how they influenzed his music, the author spends most of his effort providing a personal review of each album to include an inordiniate amount of time discussing bootleg or foreign release recordings that most fans have never heard. In addition, I am under the impression that Downing did little or no interviews of Young associates, rather he gathered info from printed interviews with the subject, etc. Not much insight there!"
3,An unauthorized bio is better than none,"""A Dreamer of Pictures"" is a fairly by-the-numbers account of the life of the great Neil Young. It makes for interesting reading if only because the reclusive Young is such a fascinating fuiure and there simply are no other comprehensive biographies of his life. The most interesting fact that I did not know was that Young's first professional band included the one and only Rick James! Young obviously offered author Downing no assistance in putting this biography together, and it shows. Maybe someday Neil will get the proper treatment that his place in rock music history deserves. Until then, we'll have to be satisfied by this ""Dreamer."""
4,An Outstanding Entry in a Crowded Field,"Many books purport to offer marketing advice. However, most of them, especially those that are case study-oriented, are somewhat superficial and simply reiterate some basic truths that most practitioners already know. In contrast, Warner's book digs in deep to provide the nitty gritty ""so what"" details that readers need in order to actually apply the lessons to their own work. You are not left hanging as to what the company under discussion actually did, or what results were achieved. As a marketer with a leading technology company, I was particularly interested in the chapter on Kodak's success with the EasyShare camera and software. There are some great lessons on how to get beyond the ""early adopter"" crowd to succeed with the mainstream consumer. I have passed this book on to others in my organization, who report that they too have found it both insightful and useful."
5,Awareness,"An amazing book.That is all I can say for now after my first read. It helped me to understand the former Soviet Union a lot more, especially the Russian-Ukraine issue. I also liked the larger than life character of Boris."
5,Weaver 301,"The 301 is a fast and easy base to install. But it's strong, as needed on a Super Blackhawk. After shooting 20 rds. I check to see if shot lose. But it was still sound."
5,Thank you Shannon!,"I kept up with Shannon's Fit Pregnancy Video throughout my pregnancy and loved it! So of course after my son was born and I wanted my old body back, I turned to Shannon! She's so encouraging and easy to work out with! I loved it! Getting my old body back wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be! I really recommend this video!"
4,Perfect for Babies,"What a great book! Our 9 month old isn't really ready for stories yet -- distractions come easy. However these are the greatest baby pictures, and she loves the book. Each page is simply a photograph of a baby with a simple caption: ""smiling,"" ""laughing"" and so forth. That's about it. It is only about eight pages but for a little one it is like looking in a mirror. And because it is a ""board book"" it is difficult to chew through! (An equally important consideration.)"
3,Not quite what I thought it would be,"The title is peek a boo, but most of the images are simply baby/toddler faces. One laughing, one crying, one yawning, etc. My daughter likes it, just like all the other baby faces board books, but it is not filled with peek a boo images. We had checked out a peek a boo book at the library that she was crazy about and I thought this was the same one, but it wasn't. This is a good book, but if you want peek a boo, look elsewhere!"
1,Not a favorite,My baby doesn't seem to care for this book. I ordered it when she was 3 mo. and she is now 8 months. She only likes one baby and that is the one that is smiling. I do to.
5,Simple and captivating,"This book is very simple- some of the pages have only one word on them, such as ""laughing,"" ""yelling,"" etc. What will captivate your baby are the close-up photos of babies' faces. My daughter, now 9 months old, LOVES this book and will smile at her favorite pages. She has always liked it, but now that she is at the age where she loves playing peekaboo, this is her hands-down favorite book."
5,very nice product,very nice complete product.collection is awsome and complete. more than was expected never seen all episodes before. very nice
2,Does NOT include Trial By Fire....the official last episode,"After questioning others on message boards who already purchased this box set, I found out that it does NOT include the official last Walker episode/movie called Trial By Fire, which aired on CBS a few years after the season finale of Walker. This is a real shame and doesn't make sense why they would leave this last episode out?? It's basically the ONLY Walker episode that is NOT included in this box set. I LOVE the Walker series, but I can only rate this box set 2 stars, because it simply isn't the COMPLETE collection as others on here have falsely stated. The ONLY official release of the last episode, Trial By Fire was place separately on an import DVD only in Europe, not in the US, and isn't compatible with US DVD players. Maybe one day, they will release it as a separate DVD in the US. The box set didn't come out til 2010, so I guess there's still hope. I just wanted to put this out there, so no one is disappointed."
5,"WOW, fast","Great price, fun to have product. Got it in just a few days. Would totally order from this seller again."
5,Walker Texas Ranger ROCKS!!,Walker Texas Ranger is the best TV show and everyone in my family loves to watch Walker. I'm so glad that I get to see every episode in order! Yay!
3,Is there a Season 9?,I keep reading the reviews and I am really confused is there a Season 8 or is it the final season or is Season 9 the final season? Can someone please figure this out and clear things up for everyone.
4,Be A contrarian,"I will not deny that the traders in this book are all very exceptional. However, I wouldn't trust anyone who came within a mile of an ""Omega"" conference. Who cares about a mock show? If you are a serious well capitalized trader then you should have no problem going to Chicago and meeting the guys who execute your trades down on the floor. I will say that I am not too sure on how good these ""floor trader living legend"" books are for off the floor position traders. You are better off buying the ""Market Wizards"" series. John Train has also written a good book."
1,Not a futures trading book at all,"To my very surprise, this book is nothing about trading, but the opinion of senior Exchange executives about the future of Exchanges. If you are a floor trader, you might be interested to know what technology, globalization and govt regulations will affect your job. Otherwise, you will find this book of zero value. The title is definitely misleading. It should be management of the futures exchange, categorized under business management."
1,Save you money.,I would give this book zero stars if I could. There is very little information of any real value. I can't believe I paid good money for this pile of scrap paper.
5,Good Writing For A Good Author,"I have known Scott for many years and his material keeps getting better and better. I am proud to be a trader right now in NYC and things have gotten rough since 9/11. But this book helped me earn over $500,000 in net worth to this day. I recommend this book to anyone that has ever been interested in the trading enviroment and who wants to make money fast!!!"
2,Rechargeable Batteries,I bouget some duracell rechargeable AAA NiMH Batteries and I would not buy them again because the charge does not last very log.
1,Buy Made in Japan White top NOT Black top,White Top batteries that are Made in Japan are the ones to buy. Black top Made in China do not last. I have 1 dozen Black Top batteries less than a year old that don't hold a charge for more than a day.
2,Things aren't what they seem,"I felt tricked!! Amazon never published the battery capacity. I bought them thinking they were 2400 mAh (by the model), but THEY WERE 750mAh!!!! I don't know if Duracell doesn't want to publish it because i coudn't find the capacity in every page that sell them. Things aren't what they seem. Arrggh!!"
1,Now showing ships in 24hrs!,Ordered these back in January and the newest shipping estimate just got bumped up to the middle of April. Seems that these batteries must be pretty rare. Maybe someday I'll actually get to see one.Finally. The slow boat from Japan must have arrived and now they are in stock. Received 3-31-06 made in Japan 900mAh which is a good thing.
3,maH specs missing,"I didn't see an maH rating for these, and assumed they were 1000maH like my previous order, not 750maH. I wanted to install a set of (6) 1000maH. I guess I will find out soon how important this is. My 3-star is for that lack of info, and for ~6 weeks time to receipt.My new lesson learned: If the fine print is missing, buy elsewhere."
2,THEY LAST A FEW MONTHS...,"They don't last that long, maybe 6 months. In fact after 3 or 4 months they don't hold a charge for very long. That eventually gets worse. I bought another pack to test them again, but if I get the same results, I will switch, most likely. I am one of those who almost always puts the phone back on the hook and I have heard that wears out batteries quicker, don't know.UPDATE: These last ones lasted only 2 months. I think I will go back to panasonic batteries. I keep buying these because they look pretty. But, they don't last. I'm not even sure 2 stars is low enough. I just changed it from 3. I tried, I really tried to give them a chance. I have a panasonic dect 6 phone I use them in and I have never had a problem with any other battery, just these duracell.UPDATE: I ordered these September 2011, because of the good reviews, so we'll see:GP RECYKO ALWAYS READY NiMH Rechargeable battery package: 8 AA 2100 mAh + 8 AAA 850 mAh"
5,Fantastic Debut With RJD!,"If Ozzy Osbourne had remained in Sabbath when this album was made I don't think it would have ""worked"" with these songs and Ozzy's voice. The addition of Ronnie James Dio to the fold was the perfect step to bring Sabbath into the '80s. The first four songs on this disc are absolutely brilliant, a fact proven by RJD's performance of two of the tunes with his own band to this day. Although Ronnie lasted just a couple of albums with Sabbath he was the perfect addition at that time and cemented the group's legacy. A fantastic release worth your time and money!"
3,Not the best remaster out there!,"I compared this rhino version of Heaven and Hell to my 1996 U.K. Castle remaster version and the Castle one sounds a little better because it's not over compressed and limited, to the point of sounding almost distorted. The bass sounds more natural, it seems to breathe a bit better than Rhino. The Rhino artwork and notes are incomplet compared to the Castle one. But most people might not hear the difference that much, so this isn't a bad buy to upgrade from the original release."
5,masterpiece,"This is such a great album. I would love to hear this played live by Ronnie and Doug Aldrich his current hired gun, like they did with Holy Diver Live."
3,Not bad for post-Ozzy,"I liken the switch of Ronnie James Dio for Ozzy Osbourne to the switch of Sammy Hagar for David Lee Roth. The first albums succeeding the original singers (Heaven and Hell, and 5150) were pretty good, but then the succeeding albums faded fast. You just can't replace a David Lee Roth or an Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy's intensely psychological lyrics made the band, and although Dio does a good job on Heaven and Hell, the style of the music is totally different. Yes, there are some good songs on here, and it's worth buying, but don't assume that you will get genuine Sabbath material in this album."
1,Not a remaster,"This album is a seminal youth album for me, probably in my top 10 albums of all time. With this disclaimer out of the way, calling this cd release some kind of a 2008 remaster is some kind of a joke, if not outright fraud. This is an original issue CD, from back in the day when all CDs sounded horrible. If you have a decent audio rig, and you expect good if not great sound from this CD, you will be severely disappointed if you purchase it."
2,Great album disappointing reissue,"I am a big Sabbath fan and I really like Sabbath's Heaven and Hell album.With that said I was very disappointed on the quality of this vinyl release.Compared to recent vinyl releases, Paranoid, Master of Reality, etc., the vinyl on this reissue is thin and not a 180 gram or audiophile quality vinyl. It looks more like a 1980's release and the cover is made with the thin carboard used in the last days of vinyl.The sound was slightly harsh and not worth the price of admission. Not a recommended purchase unless you are a completist or did not have the original vinyl release. Stick with the CD and save your money for something else."
3,They should have changed their name.,"They are NOT Black Sabbath if Ozzy isn't in the band. They should have changed their name. It's not that bad of an album, but nothing at all compared to classic Sabbath. Ozzys vocals were perfect for the type of band they were, dark, heavy and down right scary at times. Dios vocals are neither dark or scary. I was never big on Dio. Too be fair, Ozzy solo wasn't nearly as good as when he was with Sabbath.They really should have changed their name and started fresh as a new band, because Black Sabbath is suppose to be dark and they are suppose to be scary, which is Ozzy and Iommi. Theres nothing scary or dark about Dio.Black Sabbath is War Pigs, Planet Caravan, Children of the Grave, Sweat Leaf, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Fluff, Laguna Sunrise, Changes, Black Sabbath, The Wizard, NIB, Iron Man, Supernaut, Symptom of the Universe, Fairies Wear Boots, Hand of Doom, After Forever, Solitude, Snowblind, Warning etc...Don't forget the CLASSIC Black Sabbath!!"
5,"One word, INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!","This album is great. The standout tracks are: Neon Knights, Children of the Sea, Heaven and Hell, Wishing Well, Walk Away and my personal favorite Die Young. This album is a must have."
3,Dio Saves The Day!,"This album is one of their best. If it weren't for Ronnie James Dio, Black Sabbath would have faded out, ""into the void"". He refreshed a band that had been playing live and recording for over a decade, having not received the ""hit status"" and recognition they deserved.I believe it was for the best that Ozzy Osbourne left the band when he did. With RJD, the band was rejuvinated; except for Bill Ward, maybe. Bill Ward didn't support the album on tour. He does play great on this album. To date, it is one of his best efforts with the band. Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi both shine.The song, Lady Evil, is a throw back to Technical Ecstasy's, Rock and Roll Doctor!I think that the lineup could use RJD, again. One more album and tour for 2008?It would be a fitting end to the Black Sabbath story."
3,i've heard better,"Hey...i can honestly say that there are alot of screwballs saying this album is great. Its not bad, but the Ozzy era albums will always be better, and there's no argument... i hate Dio and all that he did. He butchered the classic Sabbath tracks on Live Evil, so I feel that he is just not the right guy to sing heavy metal songs like Paranoid, War Pigs, or Iron Man. That's pretty much my opinion."
3,Wait for a better one,The cover is a bit blurry and details are not as visible as on the original edition.Sound-bass is better-BUT details are killed by it and voice is drowning .makes sense to wait for a better one.
5,Sabbath returns nicely...,"Bill Ward claims he doesn't remember drumming on this album due to blackouts caused by alcohol/drugs. I'd hate to see what he could do if he was straight. From the opening chords of Neon Knights through the ending song of Lonely Is The Word Mr. Ward's timekeeping on this masterpiece is incredible. Sabbath sounds refreshed with the addition of Ronnie James Dio to the fold and crank out a metal masterpiece. Iommi's riffs are strong, Geezer plays like its his first album(incredibly as always) and vocally Dio sounds incredible. Tight and fresh metal. A revitalized Sabbath...Unfortunately with any Post Ozzy Sabbath line-up only two studio lps(up to Dehumanizer) and Live Evil."
5,Dio at his prime,"Wow, what can I say... this record blew me away from the very first time i heard it on a music camp and it still does. The old sound of Black Sabbath is almost completely gone, so it should be better to call them Black Dio or something in that manner, cause its more like Dios former band Rainbow with Tony Iommis sensitive guitar. This creates the near to perfect mix with songs like Neon Knights, Children Of The Sea and of course, the exceptional, outstanding, fantastic epic title track. This is without a doubt Dios best work to date, mostly cause his bandcomrades really knew what they were doing, and he didnt get people with that caliber to his soloprojekt 3 years later. A must-have for tradition metal fans."
5,Classic Sabbath,"This album featuring the new line up in 1980 is truly one of Sabbath's greatest albums.Although different than the Ozzy years,it is one of their heaviest and powerful recordings ever.Neon Knights,a fast hard driving classic opens the first side,followed by the demonic sounding power ballad Children of the Sea.Next comes Lady Evil a evil fast paced classic.Heaven and Hell closes the side going with it's slow,powerful riff,which marks it as a Sabbath classic.Side two has the powerful Die Young and power ballad Lonely is the Word.This album is a must for a true Sabbath fan.If you don't have it-buy it you won't be disappointed."
4,The Strongest DIO Era Sabbath,"This one rocks. Period.Children of the Sea is as good as anything the original line-up ever did, but it stands on its own.Heaven and Hell, Neon Knights and Die Young are also classic.The second side sags a little at the end, but this is definitely worth a listen."
3,My first Black Sabbath Experience,"This was my first Black Sabbath release, many moons ago, on (ack!) eight-track tape, so I decided to purchase it again on CD.It's just as good as I remember, way back when, but the quality of the sound is also just as good as I remember. (On tape)I'm sorry I didn't spend the extra couple of bucks and get the re-mastered version."
2,Not Quite Sabbath But.......,"Face it,Ozzy is really not a great singer,he just has a sound,and that sound is as much Black Sabbath as Iommi's classic riffs,Butler's mighty bass fills , and Ward's thundering drums. While musically there are a lot of good things on this album. It's too much the Ronnie James Dio and his back-up band album.Another big part of Sabbath is that Terry ""Geezer"" Butler was always the band's lyricist until this album.This is really only about half a decent album,the second side seemed like a lot of filler and outtakes.Dehumanizer was their best with Dio because it wasn't so typical of the silly garbage that he has masqueraded as music for his whole career,and Butler sounds more interested on that album too."
2,Black sabbath?,"What happened to black sabbath here? Without ozzy, sabbath is not rhe same. Black sabbath was about the apocalypse, revenge, drugs, and war. This new black sabbath is about dragons and nights. What is up with that? Dio is an okay singer, but he lacks that feel that ozzy had. If you want the real sabbath, get the early to mid 70's stuff. At least this is not as embarrasing as never say die or rtechnical extasy! Sabbath was a good stoner rock band, not this almost glam rock band. this gets 2 stars cause the only good song in neon nights (preatty gay name but good track, the rest sucks!) Ozzy rules. Black sabbath died in 1978."
1,It's just not the same without Ozzie.,"When Black sabbath had Ozzie, they were awsome. Black Sabbath really broke up when they kicked out Ozzie. They just dno't sound like they uses to."
1,"She' s a magical, mystical woman. Indeed.","This is truly Black Sabbath at their worst. Ronnie James is a horrible singer. He also has an ego that really got in the way during his years with Sabbath, ultimately leading to his being dismissed. ""Look at me, I'm the new Ozzy!"" ""I'm the god of heavy metal, worship me!"" Gimme a break, Ronnie. The lyrics to some of these songs here(written by RJD)are so juvinile, so pathetic, you would think a fourteen year old child on his first acid trip wrote them. Sure, Tony's guitar playing shines as usual, but it doesn't rescue this awful album from the infestation of that rat Dio. Not recommended."
4,Life After Ozzy,"Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne are often synonomous. Yet, with this album the remaining members attempted to show that life can go on even after Ozzy left. HEaven and Hell is an awesome record, displaying that the Sabbath can still rock. It Opens up furiously and never really lets you go - until the end. Hence, four stars. Still, there is no denying the power from the title track and Neon Knights. Dio proves to be a worthy successor to Ozzy, even though he is not as popular. Many fans like to think Sabbath was nothing after 1978. That's not true! A lot of great music came afterwards. Personally, i feel Sabbath's last real album was Born Again, since all of them afterward are basically Iommi Solo Projects (Though good ones at that). It's time to get acquainted with Heaven and Hell. Give it a try! You may be pleasantly surprised!"
4,The best album with Dio,This is the first and best album with Dio. All the songs are very good with the exception of Heaven and Hell which is excellent. Its not like the classic albums with Ozzy (the first 6 albums) but it has another atmosphere. Itds more heavy and not so <<doom>> lets say. Personally i prefer old Black Sabbath but this album is also a very good album. For all metal fans
5,Black Sabbath's best album,"""Heaven and hell"" came out the same year Judas Priest released their ""British Steel"" and Motorhead ""Ace Of Spades"" - 1980. These three albums are among the finest metal records ever to be released. On ""Heaven and hell"", Sabbath could write songs with a different vocal structure since singer Ronnie James Dio by far is a more skilled and competent singer than Ozzy Osbourne. This time Black Sabbath sounded like a whole new band, and most of the songs should be regarded as classics. In fact there are only two songs (""Walk Away"" and ""Lonely Is the Word"") that doesn't have the same calibre as the rest.In fact, Sabbath had a freshness on this release that sadly were gone by the time they released the next one - ""Mob Rules"". After that Ronnie James Dio left the band to form his own self titled band Dio, and Sabbath got Ian Gillan (Deep Purple) on vocals and released an even worse album with the most misplaced title ""Born Again""."
4,Dio Era Sabbath,"1980 release by Black Sabbath with Dio on vocals. Ozzy left in 1979 for a solo career. They actually are a Christian band, despite their evil reputation and Ozzy's controversial, and the first Christian and heavy metal band as we know today with a substantial following. Key tracks are: Neon Knights, Lady Evil, Children of the Sea and the title track Heaven and Hell. Heaven and Hell song as covered by Stryper on The Covering album."
4,Great Album - But Not Their Best,"I think that this album is solid. As much as I love Ozzy, Dio is damn good on this. You just have to think of this as a different band. Anyone who likes Sabbath should enjoy this album."
3,"Great first half, but then...","This album starts off brilliantly, but the last few songs seem like filler. ""Walk Away"", in particular, is so lightweight and poppish that you might almost be listening to Kiss rather than Black Sabbath."
5,Very happy with items,I live in europe and my items came in with in 1 week... Will order from these people again... Thank You
5,"My ""inquiring mind"" wanted to know..and she told me!!","I always hope a book will be entertaining,well written in a style to keep my attention, and to inform me of interesting facts on the subject. I enjoyed a winner in all catagories in this book. Keep 'em coming, Christine!! thanks for the many hours of pleasure!"
2,"Excellent when recording facts, but otherwise very biased.","Christine Brennan does a good job of relating historical events and telling a skaters story. However, it is obvious to readers that she is biased. Her descriptions and stories vary greatly from positive to negative depending on the skater. Her obvious bias and prejudice shows clearly. She does not appear objective at all. It is fascinating to read about the lives and events in the world of figure skating. But the critisms and the sutle slams are obnoxious. She makes inferences and judgements about skaters that she obviously does not like. It is difficult to enjoy this book. It has the potential to be wonderful, however, Ms. Brennan's lack of objectivity ruins the book."
1,"Vindictive, ill-informed, one-sided","This book is even more biased and tabloid-esque than her last! Don't waste your money or your time, reading this blatant promotion of Ms. Brennan's personal favorites at the expense of everyone else. Believe me, I'm not a Lipinski fan, but Ms. Brennan has gone beyond the bounds of good taste and sensitivity with many of her remarks about the Lipinski entourage. A little vindication for their refusal to grant her an interview?? Just remember, Christine, it isn't necessary to blow out one person's flame just so another's will APPEAR brighter."
3,Only Skating the Surface,"Edge of Glory is a reasonable, entertaining quick-read account of the run up to the 1998 Olympic Figure Skating events. Starting in early '97, the book follows key US, Canadian, and Russian skaters along the path to Nagano.If you know little of skating and are interested, this book is worth a read, but it goes into very little depth, and much of it is painfully written. It presents no insight into the controversial judging process, and doesn't seem interested in asking questions about how the sport is run, or contextualizing the '98 Olympics in terms of skating history.Author Brennan is apparently a USA Today columnist, and that's exactly how Edge of Glory reads, minus those colorful graphs."
4,"Great! I do wish she had waited til Worlds were over, tho.","I loved the inside track on one of the greatest sports in the world. Brennan is clear and concise. She has a genuine love for this sport and is genuinely concerned about the direction it is going in and all of that is clear in her writing. She also manages to bring the thrill of the competition to the printed page. I just wish she had waited until the Worlds were over with to write it, that's all."
5,excellent synopsis of 97-98 skating seasons.,"I liked this better than Inside Edge because it details what it is like in figure skating leading up to the Olympics. In her book the struggles, pressure,and pains are well described. True more attention is given to Michelle Kwan, but I don't feel I came away with any negative feelings toward Tara Lipinski. I think Tara's parents (especially her mother) and agent are portrayed more critically then Tara. Overall, I thought it was an entertaining story of the classic battle of Tara vs Michelle and the rest of skaters in the 1998 Olympic games. A must read for any skating or sport fan!"
4,really entertaining!,"this book is really interesting to read. i didn't know the skaters' life were so dramatic. and tara's mother is really crazy! i hope tara will be clever enough not to let her mom influence her too much. i'm a huge fan of michelle kwan but i like tara too. but reading the behavior of her family, it just scared me. they're really obnoxious, especially her mom. god, she's the kind of mother who could kill her daughter's rivals.she's pitiful. hopefully tara will get rid of this parasite who lives through her. she's really not a good model for the mothers of young athletes."
4,More Delicious Inside Gossip from the Skating World,"If you are a fan of figure skating, you will enjoy this book. Brennan presents her topic with clarity and honesty, writing about skaters and people in the sport that you normally don't hear much about. I did find Brennan to be somewhat biased in her comments and at times a bit tactless in her remarks, especially about Elena Berezhnaia (""Skate In Head""), but all in all, this book is very entertaining and the author astute in her observations. It is interesting how Brennan contrasts the way Michelle Kwan and her family conduct themselves with quiet grace and dignity versus the loud, obnoxious, arrogrant, pushy Lipinski clan. Anybody who claims Brennan is biased against the Lipinskis should take a look at the self-serving dribble dished out by Tara and her Mommy in the yawn-a-thon book ""Totally Tara""."
3,"Good information, highly biased","If you are looking for more information on how skaters train & create programs, you will find it in this book. If, however, you are looking for an unbiased account, this is not the book for you. Fans of Michelle Kwan, Michael Weiss, Scott Davis, Alexei Urmanov, & Tonia Kwaiakowski will be pleased since they receive a balanced treatment. The skaters who did not agree to be interviewed for this book are treated unfairly. She found anyone willing to talk about them, and unfortunately, they said many cruel things. I wish she had at least let those skaters comment on the remarks about them. Therefore, I can not give this book my highest rating."
3,"Lacks the depth of ""Inside Edge"", and has definite biases","I enjoyed ""Inside Edge"" and really looked forward to this one. I was disappointed in her biases, especially against the new Olympic gold medalist. Brennan seems to think focus and perfectionism is a fault, and she drops snide inuendo throughout the book. More superficial than ""Inside Edge""...obvious written more quickly."
4,Very addictive read!,"While I agree that there is a bit of an anti-Tara bias in this book, which is a bit much and can be offensive to her fans at times (as I am a fan of Tara's myself, I know there were several places where I found some negative comments about Tara and her skating that irked me tremendously), the other parts of the book made up for it -- overall this book is an engaging subjective view of the fascinating world of elite figure skating.The only thing that is missing is more coverage of some of the up and coming skaters in the sport, which is what made her first book so good as well. Hopefully we will see more of this in the next book?"
5,Must have,"As a professional photographer I was looking for a durable and versatile bag that allows hands-free carrying and quick lens changes. The Magnum AW works perfectly for me. I usually carry around a one body, 4 lenses, one flash outfit, but it also leaves enough space for a Mini DV Camera, a set of filters, batteries and other small stuff. The shoulder strap is comfortable and keeps the bag right in place - so you can leave it open for quick access."
3,you will like it if your a fan,"Nothing much to say except if your a fan it's a great family series to watch together. Your standard tv show dvd set, wish they would but more special features like a tour of the studio, how they set it up, get the audience (if there's one), just would find it interesting. Also I hope they put the movies on dvd as well."
5,Sabrina Teen Age Witch,I enjoyed this last Sabrina tape as much as I have enjoyed the rest I really like all the actors they have playing the rolls as they fit them perfectly. I enjoy seeing what kind of mischief every one gets into. One of my favorites is Salem. I love his voice and how funny he is he really makes me laugh as do the others. The tapes are wonderful !!!!!! I have all of the seasons.
4,Not as good as the first four seasons,"I have the whole series of Sabrina and seasons 1 - 5 are the best. Seasons 6 & 7 kind of lose the fun when Harvey is no longer her boyfriend and Libby is not her nemisis. I think the high school environment added to the fun. Season 6 tries hard, but just does not seem as much to laugh about."
2,Not even good comedy.,"So... it's loosely based on the bizarre life of John Holmes. So what? So... it has Academy Award Winner Julianne Moore starring as a porn star. It was beneath her talent and dignity... way beneath! And for Burt Reynolds, it began a string of crappy scripts that typecast him as an old, bumbling, past-his-peak looser. That was one hell of a fate for ""Smokey."" Apparently the high point of the film is supposed to be 3 seconds at the very end when the viewer gets to see the Holmes-based character flash his 10-inch penis. Whoop-dee-fricken-do! Whatta rush!... not."
2,Its a filter....BUT...,"The package includes a filter but the picture is MISLEADING! Even though there is no mention of a gasket or the lack there of; One would assume that the filter would include a gasket. Attached to the top of the filter a piece of paper reads ""NOTE: GASKETS NOT SUPPLIED PURCHASE SEPARATELY""I cant even find this filter her in this small town of Santa Maria, CA. How the hell am I supposed to find the gaskets. I needed this filter yesterday, and now I need to figure out where to find the gaskets. It's a big inconvenience for me."
4,Life savers,"I have had a pair of these since I was an electrician in the US Navy. When I wear out the sole, usually the rest of the boot has been through enough to warrant a new pair. The last pair made it over six years. While I was an electrician, these boots made the difference between life and death when I was shocked from the 450V distribution bus. I didn't even get hurt too bad. The only complaint I would lodge about the new pair that I just bought is that the tongue doesn't have the same double layer of leather like the last pair, right at the top of the tongue. Because it is only a single layer, it doesn't lay as flat against my shin and will take a while longer to ""train"" to lay flat. Other than that, the boots are of superb quality."
5,Lay down your arms...,"This isn't a flawless set- the performance of Corduroy is lyrically flubbed, and Betterman is unremarkable, without the 'tags' that lend the songs personality live. However, I have yet to find a flawless Pearl Jam bootleg, and for those who collect them obsessively (like myself), there are few better from this tour. Several of the songs off Binaural are treated to passionate and spot-on renditions, most notably God's Dice, Grievance, and Insignificance. Several of the band's best live cuts, such as Release, RVM, and Evenflow, are also strong, backed by a packed Allstate Arena crowd. The show ends with a great performance of Baba O' Riley, with Ed exhorting the crowd to sing along- as if they needed the encouragement.If you're only going to buy one bootleg from this tour, make it #72, the tour ender in Seattle. If you're getting any more, make this one a priority."
5,Almost like being there,"I have been singing the praises of Pearl Jam since the first time I saw them live. I attended this concert and I must say this cd brought back some great memories of that night. For those fans who weren't able to attend, you must buy this album. For those fans who were there, i know i don't have to sell this album, you probably already have it. Eddie was at his best that night as was the rest of the band. Their rendition of rvm was spectacular. This cd is the next best thing to being there in person."
5,get this show,This is the best official bootleg that I have heard so far. I have about 20 of them and this is definately a stand out. The band is obviously energetic and play great.
1,Rip Off,"This book is a waste of money! It is very, very brief review of Eagles history and is historically incorrect in several areas."
4,"smells great, flexible hold","The hairspray has a nice flexible hold, great for wearing hair curly or straight. I also like the smell of the hairspray and that it doesn't give you helmet hair. :)"
5,My new fave!!,"I have long, wavy and a LOT of hair and this stuff is magic! It smells great (not perfumy or like chemicals or like candy/fruity). It holds my style ALL day without drying or feeling heavy or sticky. I can't say enough about the goodness in this sleek and sexy red bottle! Can't beat the price either! I've tried too many hairsprays to count and this one beats them all! I hope they don't ever change the formula or discontinue this one!! If you want great hold with soft hair and movement TRY THIS!!"
3,CHI Hair Spray,"This is a decent hair spray but in my opinion there are better quality flexible style hair sprays out there for less money. I didn't hate it, and I'm glad I tried it, but unless there was a super sale on it I don't see me purchasing it again."
3,I like this alright,This hairspray is a little pricier that I usually use and the smell is a bit overpowering for me but I have allergies and am very sensitive to perfumes.
3,does not hold my hair,"it does not hold my hair. I do not how it holds other people's, i think my hair is too stiff idk"
5,Great product,"I'm sold on this Chi hair spray. It's strong enough to hold my short, curly hairstyle, but light enough to be able to run your fingers through your hair (depending on how much you use). Plus, it has a great fragrance which is not obtrusive,"
5,Berlitz has done it again!,"I got nothing but compliments on how quickly I was picking Romanian up, by the locals on my two week trip. As usual Berlitz has created a great introduction to the language. It is up to you to refine your language skills through immersion in the culture.This book is chocked full of information. This book is not intended to be a phrase book and it's entire emphasis is the unique sentence structure that the Romanian language requires.I also recently had one of the books I authored translated into Romanian by the Sibiu Monetary Financial Commodities Exchange. This was a book that one of the translators recommend to me and I was not disappointed."
5,Keeper,"Yet another fine book out of the HBS stable. Badarraco uses case study and analysis to offer another study on the importance of knowledge in the business landscape. There have long been corporate interdepencies--product, service, etc--and in this information age knowledge sharing and alliances will increasingly be the lifeblood of companies. Companies must sustain and build upon their competitive advantages--read this book to find yet another way."
5,The best disaster film I've seen yet .....,"For once, the subplots weren't overwhelming or detracting from the major theme of a film, this one focused mainly upon the prediction of the imminent ""big one."" The most diverting subplot dealt with a very persistent sniper determined to bag his quarry and was quite enjoyable. ;-PAnd the ""big one"" did indeed happen, preceded by smaller quakes and followed by aftershocks. The realism was absolutely terrific, the acting superb, and the overall mood solemn and thought-provoking.Highly recommended for disaster film fans! :-)"
5,Early 90s disaster movie that still holds up today.,"I still vividly remember watching this over 2 nights as a young boy around ten or so who was supposed to be sleeping, afraid I would get in trouble if mom or dad caught me but far to caught up in the suspense to go to sleep and miss it. It's great to see it again so many years later on DVD. The depictions of a massive earthquake were so well done for the time and it definitely holds up pretty well to todays standards, though if the movie was made today it would certainly be made a lot differently. This was a fantastic revisitation of a movie from my childhood that I never forgot."
5,Better than homemade,"I've made gumbo from scratch many times with differing results. And getting it right takes time, lots of time. This mix is fool-proof, takes twenty-five minutes, and comes out right every time. I start with the trinity, use a little less water (makes a thicker gumbo),and add a good andouille and chicken/shrimp. Top with file and enjoy."
5,complete satisfaction,"This arrived exactly as advertised, and on time. I could not have been more satisfied with the service and quality."
3,Raitt's 6th solo record,"This was Bonnie Raitt's sixth solo record, recorded in 1979. It is a solid CD with many good songs. ""The Glow"" and ""(Goin') Wild For You Baby"" are two of my favorites. These songs show the early maturity of Raitt's future success. While the other songs on the disk are good they can't compare with her more contemporary recordings. This is still a must have for any Bonnie Raitt collector."
5,Better than expected,I did not realize that at the top and the bottom there is a ridge that block all scratches so far. This watch is great for the price
4,good cut,upon hearing this I though Luther Vandross might be onto something but the rest of His Album never matched this track to me.but this is a Good Up-Date to Luther.
2,Swinging French Lounge Psychedelia,"Best description for our times would be Austin Powers music in French. This series of CDs runs on the cool, loungy side of psychedelia, with a distinct Continental flavour. Music for swinging dandies. From the discs I have, most of the tracks in this series seem to be presented here in mono, as they perhaps were on first release in the late 60s. However I have some of the same songs on the individual artists' CDs that have been remastered in stereo and the clarity is better. So you can take your pick: buy the seperate remastered albums or get all the choice tracks on one CD , albeit in mono.If you want French 60s music with less hippy and more of a Yeh-Yeh or lolita rock'n'roll flavour search for April March, early France Gall, the ""Femmes De Paris"" series or the sometimes more serious, but ever alluring and musically gifted Francoise Hardy."
3,3PW Blood Brawls & Broads,3PW was an ECW style promotion ran by Jasmine St. Claire and the Blue Meanie.Gary Wolfe vs. Rockin Rebel in a Dog Collar Match.Josh Daniels vs. Rob Eckos.Danny Doring vs. Devon Storm.Blue Meanie vs. Christian York.Public Enemy vs. Bad Breed.Gary Wolfe vs. Christian York for the 3PW Title.Sabu vs. Syxx-Pac.Sandman vs. Sabu vs. New Jack in a Body Bag Match.
5,AN Alternative!!!,"I truly enjoyed the variety this dvd has to offer.I highly recommend it to those of you looking for wrestling that has something for everyone!!The Dog collar match was insane!!!I loved the Jasmine in the wet t shirt contest!!The Syxx Pac /Sabu match was amazing & I also enjoyed some of my all time favorites such as The Blue Meanie,Devon Storm, New Jack The Public Enemy.What are yiu waiting for? Buy it now!! It beats the WWE!!!"
5,Wow...This Is What You Call EXCITING History!,"When someone gave me this book as a sort of gift, I was kind of reluctant to read it. I mean, it looked like another one of those thick, boring biography collections that line the bookshelves in your social studies classroom. Was I ever wrong...I started reading this book, thinking I'd just read for a few minutes, and soon half an hour had gone by. Phillip Hoose has done a wonderful job of creating a book with dynamic young people throughout history that inspire us all. And he goes beyond telling about Phillis Wheatley...he tells about Anna Meyer, who played professional baseball during World War 2, John Tinker who boldly stood up for his rights to protest the Vietnam War, and the boys who played a crucial-yet-rarely-realized role as part of the crew on Columbus's voyage. So you think history's boring? Read this book and see it in a whole new light!"
5,Fantastic Price,"I really wanted this comic and i found it on here for 6.00 INCLUDING shipping! Fantastic condition. Normally, a good condition one like this would sell for around 100$!!!!! bought this as quick as i could ;]"
3,...the last book *sniff*,"What a great way to end the series... a huge slowpoke, while the book is halariusly funny,and full of humour it wasn't what i was lead up to believe, Jesse and James are cute but they didn't really show much romance between the two, although a lot better than what the tv's doing. there wasn't much AAML but i can live with that."
5,Good for older fans,"If you like pokemon but are sick of the juvenile dumbed-down tv series and movies, I highly recommend this and other Japanese Pokemon manga. Though young pokemon fans can enjoy this too, it's a great treat for teenaged and older fans. Unlike the show, it actually assumes the reader has some intelligence. Even though there is a lot of censoring, the level of american content editing is considerably lower than the series. The art is very good too. The pokemon are more realistic and less cartoonish than in the tv series. Highly recomended to Pokemon fans of all ages."
2,Too wide... can't use it with Nikon lens cases.,"I've bought it to use it with Nikon cases, as the CL-M2 for my 70-200 or the cases that comes with the 24-70, 14-24, and SB900.... but none of them can be attached on this belt.I love my Domke bags, great materials, but this belt it's not very intelligent built. The belt buckle should be removable in order to allow narrower loops...Really disappointed. No images or instructions..."
4,Decent Ink - unique color,"I like this ink color and ease of use. It takes a bit longer to dry than expected so only 4 stars. If you're ok with ink staying wet for a few minutes and want a nice slate gray, this is a great and affordable choice."
3,"Well, it has its moments","Homestar Runner is funny, and my 11-yr old brother loves it. But the character Homestar was waaaaaaay too annoying for my taste! It has a few good episodes, but I think Strongbad Email is better. I guess if your a Strongbad fan, this is for you."
5,Team Penning,"The book is a nice overview of what team penning is all about. Rules, stratagies and basic information."
4,practical knowledgeable guide to a challenging sport.,"This book is an excellent guide for novice team penners. I read this book before penning and was much better prepared than a rank amateur. The chapter on ""reading cattle"" was especially useful. The sport is a lot harder to do than the book suggests however. BEST RESOURCE I know."
1,posse,"i bought a copy of this movie and will not play because it is formated for some other country, the usa is not in the region for it to play"
3,Not one of Siegel's Better Efforts,"Having read several of Siegel's tales of Michael Daley, I was greatly disappointed with this entry. Unlike the crisp, fast paced writing of Siegel's other works (try Special Circumstances), this book is very slow-moving with very little suspense. Even the usual appearance of Nick the Dick Hanson does little to save this book. Michael's client, Skipper Gates has nothing to like about him and the reader doesn't care if Daley gets him off or not. When all is revealed in the end you shake your head as the explanation to what actually occurred if very far-fetched."
4,Strong Characterization,"The storyline itself is standard fare for a legal thriller. Well known defendent finds himself in a compromising position, his political enemies look to skewer him, troubling family issues are purcolating just below the surface, and the defendent tells continuous lies and half-truths until the facts prove otherwise.What helps this story stand out from others is the strength of the lead characters, especially defense attorney Michael Daley. Daley is one of the more believable characters I've encountered. His relationship with his ex-wife, both professional and personal, adds a very interesting component to the story.The defendent in this case, District Attorney Prentice 'Skipper' Gates is an extremely unlikeable fellow, but readers may surprisingly find themselves having a touch of sympathy (if not actually rooting for him) simply because Daley believes in his innocence."
5,Excellent Legal Thriller,"I read lots of crime fiction, but I look for character development and a strong sense of time and place as well as a good story. Mr. Siegel has certainly succeeded. The characters are believable, the contradictions of San Francisco and its politics are always bubbling just below the surface, and the story is a real page-turner.The trial itself, which comprises a substantial portion of the book, is handled with intelligence and compassion for all the ""actors"" involved, and Mr. Siegel never ""writes down"" to the reader, but treats him/her with respect.For those who enjoy intelligent courtroom drama, this is a book you will want to read.R. BlockWestlake Village, CA"
1,Reguritation,"As noted by several previous reviewers, this story is similar in too many ways to his previous work ""Special Circumstances."" Furthermore, it's a far more tedious read."
5,Siegel is two for two!,"With his outstanding first novel SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, author Sheldon Siegel introduced us to Michael Daley, defense attorney, ex-priest, and ex-public defender. Now with his second book, INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE, Mike Daley is back along with his law partner and ex-wife, Rosie Fernandez, and Sheldon Siegel scores once again in a big way.With the Michael Daley series, Siegel offers a fresh take on the legal thriller. Deftly combining suspense, wit and at times, laugh out loud humor. INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE is compulsively readable. While some legal thrillers are often dark affairs with angst-ridden characters who walk the fine line between hero and villain, Mike Daley and his extended family are likeable characters touched with humanity.If you haven't read Mr. Siegel's books, pick one up. You won't be disappointed."
3,Not As Good As His First,"The authors first book, Special Circumstances, is excellent. This book just doesn't have the same suspense. The charachters are dull, story line isn't very exciting, and there is no intrique. It is an easy read but I predicted the 'who done it' pretty soon into the story line. Bottom line, I wasn't very interested in the who killed the young gay hooker story line and why.....no intrique....not a page turner."
2,Too much of the same thing,"I agree with other reviewers who state this book is just too similar to the first one. He seems to be a good author, but the scenarios and the actual wording in some cases are way too similar to the first book. He could do much better!"
5,MICHAEL DALEY BOOK TWO,"There sure is no sophomore jinks here for Sheldon Seigel. INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE is a home run court room drama, second book with San Francisco's defense lawyer Michael Daley and his ex-wife legal partner Rosie Fernandez. There might be more experienced lawyers than Daley but you know he is good when the San Francisco DA, Prentice Gates is arrested and calls Daley in to be his lawyer. And what an arrest to defend, the DA when a dead male prostitute found handcuffed in his bed. Great story, charaCters, and excellent court room drama. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Incriminating Evidence,"As with ""Special Circumstances"", Sheldon Seigel has spun yet another intriguiging thriller by mixing politics, family secrets, betrayal, sex, power, drugs and even religion. Mike Daley is back as the San Francisco's criminal defense attorney who takes on a high profile homocide case involving an elected official and uncovers a web of corruption that touches the lives of all those involved. The courtroom scenes are engrossingly written with a fast pace that is often punctured by wit and humor and the characters are developed even to the last page. You will find yourself guessing and second-guessing the suspects and your suspense won't be relieved until the very end. A good read."
4,great little device,"i really like this device. it is small, works well and is easy to use. I highly recommend it."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"when it works (very rarely) it is fine. i have had problems with this unit within a year of purchase. it has trouble locking into satellites. yes, i tried all garmin's suggestions. been working with them for 8 months. tried everything, sent back to mfger, installed new software updates, the 3 button trick away from buildings, blah blah. garmin is stalling. let's see if they eventually DO THE RIGHT THING."
3,"Business ""Door Prize""","This GPS was purchased as a ""door prize"" for a business conference. Considering the price, it was not as impressive in size as we had hoped, and we almost returned it. But since the next biggest screen size was almost double the price of this one, we kept it. It was well received by the recipient."
2,"Directs you into buildings, hope you've got good insurance","All kidding aside, the fit, finish, and look of the maps on this device are top notch. However, the maps apparently are not updated as frequently as Garmin would like you to believe. We were directed to driving directly into the wall of a store that was built a few years ago. Also, directions on freeway splits aren't obvious or accurate at all. Buyer beware, if you need to return to Amazon because of these reasons, they will charge you about $60 for doing so."
5,Awesome!!,"This GPS works flawlessly. It is small,compact and portable it runs on batterys!!! Of course you can plug it in to your cigar lighter also."
1,GPS,Garmin should discontinue manufacture of this unit. This unit is not very user friendly. To much trouble to enter data. I sent it back and purchased the Nuvi 350 (great product).
5,Garmin is great,This is the second garmin gps our family has bought ( for two seperate cars) They are quick to respond to everything. This was a refurb and it is totally fine.
5,I don't know how I ever got along without it!,This is an amazing little device. I been using it for 2+ months now and love it. i don't know how I ever got along without it!
3,not bad for the money,"Not a bad gps for the money. very easy ,intuitive menu, just a bit slower than the big boys going for $600+small and very accurate."
3,Good product back in the day,This was a good GPS back when GPS was for the rich. At $350.00 (Back then) it was a deal. I traveled a lot for work and gave me a safety net when I traveled. This little guy started my love of Garmin product.
5,Very impressed with this little wonder,"Ive not thought much of Garmin until I read the reviews here and I asked my wife to gift me this baby on my birthday. The unit is really the best purchase I have made in recent times. Beautiful little screen - not too big , not too small. Right size, Clear voice prompts, accurate voice, scaringly precise tracking and speed sensing. WAAS capable, acquires signal easily after shut off, intuitive operation, night and day mode, extensive list of features, upgradable memory, supplied car adapter and on and on and on.........Still with me ? Good. Just buy it . You wont regret it.PS: The unit has some minor annoyances like displaying a ""very approximate"" time to destination , its not perfect but its darn close!"
4,Great help for directionally challenged drivers...,"I feel so empowered! This great product saved me in Dallas so many times. The only time I had a problem was when I didn't trust the unit and made my own decisions or when we ran into new construction areas. But Gia (our nickname for our GPS) always got me back on track, thank goodness. I am the family joke regarding getting lost and always turning the opposite way than I should have. Now I am not so nervous to drive in a big city. My husband did have some trouble loading the maps, but he worked it out relatively easily. It took me a little bit to learn how to use it, but it is very user friendly so I was able to figure it out without wasting too much time. I also love that it is light enough for me to carry it on the plane easily. It will travel out of town with me always from now on."
3,warning to Macintosh users,"The software provided for the i3StreetPilot will not load with a Macintosh. I researched the information about this model and did NOT see anywhere that it had to be loaded using Microsoft Windows. I was distressed when I received it to find that I could not load it using my Macintosh. I had to return it as I do not have access to any computer except a Macintosh. I THINK, but am not sure, that the Garmin StreetPilot i5 comes preloaded. That would solve the problem (I hope). I am now researching that option."
1,Garmin Street Pilot Review,I was not happy with this product. I have difficulty installing maps and have not used the devices yet.
2,it sucks,the gps doesn't work very well and when i programmed it to go back to new york it took me to pennsylvania. Not worth $200
4,Good 2 Go,The I3 is great for whatever your needs are. The screen is quite small but it does the job. Great for travel and slapping in a rental car.
3,It does the job.. Just little slow!!!!,It does the job.. Just little slow in catching the satellite signals !!!!... but good for it's price.
4,Packs a Punch; a Few Drawbacks,"I've owned mine for about 3 months and used it in 5 U.S. states - west coast and east coast. It's my first GPS and it was a breeze to set up and begin using. I love the portability of this unit - being able to take it on a business trip and use in a rental car, or throw it in the glove box, is key. The downside to the small size is the scroll wheel interface for entering addresses. Frankly I don't mind it and the device does intuitively finish entries for you, saving you from scrolling through the alphabet to spell out a complete address or city.Some things that are lacking: the memory card can only store 5 or so states at a time (depending on how dense the road system in each state is); it does not ship with a protective case; and the power supply was not designed to work with rechargeable batteries.Some things I love about it: the portability, the accuracy, the small size, battery life, and the price."
4,Garmin i3,"Although Amazon delivered it after a big road trip I took, I was able to use it for a few others.Simple to set up, easy to load maps. I purchased a larger memory card, and loaded the whole US. I also purchased an external antenna(just in case).The size may seem small, but not really a problem navigating. I can carry it inside and load routes or look for retaurants in the area.I travel for my kids ball games, so it's real handy to get you there and find places to eat once there.Overall it's a great unit, very portable and affordable."
4,good find for the price,The GPS system that I have purchased has been put to great use. It is efficent in giving directions and comes with a few additions like park locations and resturants in the area.
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I received the Handspring Visor Edge and it came with a non-working backlight. I was walked through correcting steps that did not ever produce a backlight. When talking to customer service I was told I could be sent a replacement model (at an additonal charge of [money]), or have it repaired (shipping at my expense). HOWEVER, they will not guarantee a new unit to replace a faulty one - it could very well be a reconditioned model to replace my BRAND NEW one. So my two choices are get on old reconditioned model (at an additional [money]), or be inconvenienced by sending mine in for repair (shipping at my expense)- neither of which is a great choice for a consumer who was hoping to be enjoying their brand new Visor Edge this week. Buyer Beware I guess is the message here to any Handspring customer!!!!!!"
4,A former Luddite delighted with it!,"While a ""power user"" on the computer, I was a Luddite with regards to PDAs. They seemed so limited, counter-intuitive (in comparison to a Mac or Windows), and Graffiti seemed just so dumb! Well, I finally broke down. The deals were hard to ignore. And I got tired of carrying around that clunky paper organizer. Bought a Handspring Visor Edge (albeit in red! otherwise, the same). Graffiti came quickly. Had it for a week now and have yet to experience ANY difficulties. So easy to use--it IS intuitive! So portable. I now couldn't imagine a PDA any larger or heavier. (For a ""5,"" maybe the Treo 90? But still so new....)"
5,Argerich is the star .,"The Schumann piano concerto played by Martha Argerich flows in her hands. It is as if one has heard it for the first time. I thought I knew the piece until I heard and saw her playing in this 2006 performance of the piece. Chailly and the gewandhausorchestra Leipzig accompany her with flair. It is as though they were as one.She gives an encore Von fremden Landern und Menschen, in response to the raptuous applause for her playing of the Piano concerto. The Symphony No 4 is swift and played as it should be. The orchestra pieces Adagio and Allegro brillante arr Tchaikovsky, and four pieces from carnaval arr Ravel are forgettable."
4,Quirky Little Masterpiece,The overlooked film can be watched over and over and with each viewing will present itself in a different perspective. Many of the reviews here are very good but quite long. I for one think it would be an exercise in frustration to explain the premise of this little gem. I guess the best description would be a haywire attempt to show the interconnectedness of the Universe as seen through a kaleidoscope while riding a roller coaster. Just do yourself a favor and invest an hour and a half of your life and enjoy.....
5,"Bug, Every Step Counts",Wonderful movie. I can watch this one over and over and not grow tired of its story.
1,kit for LG phone,"you get what you pay for. the car charger and the case are fine but the ear piece is no good.First it just fell apart, I put it back together it worked for a short time now it doesn't work at all."
3,I broke it within two weeks,Everything was as I expected it. Everything fit and worked great. Getting out of my car I dropped the phone (unknowing) and steped on it. The case easily ripped at the stitches and made the case useless.I do have to question duribilty. The mic and ear holes could be a little bit bigger too.
1,DIDNT FIT QUITE RIGHT,THE CASE DIDNT FIT QUITE RIGHT AND THE CAR CHARGER WAS FAULTY NOT A GOOD PRODUCT
1,you get what you pay for,the car phone charger is not working appropriately as it doesn't release the phone easily from the charger. the on side of the charger doesn't release totally without tiliting the phone to the side
4,Anaconda DVD gripping,"This Smithsonian Networks made for tv video has a lot of info, history and myth about these giant snakes. Taking you deep into the Amazon basin and Yanos of Guyana and filming on land and underwater hunt for the largest of these massive snakes, with the help of renouned experts in the field. The interviews with eye witness accounts of the indiginous natives, make this a compelling and riviting documentery. My only dissapointment was the unanswered question of weather the reward offered ( in the 1930s ) of $50,000 by New Yorks, Museum of Natural History, for anyone bringing back a snake of over 30 feet in length was ever collected. Many stories of snakes up to 100 feet in length, but no proof. Still many of these anacondas filmed in this documentary are massive and certainly reach over 20' in length with a couple approaching the legendary 30' mark. A very engaging DVD. Well worth the $5.23 including shipping, that I paid. Joe In San Francisco"
5,Psyclone Sandal Excellent for water and kids with sensitive feet,"My kiddo is very picky about her shoes. They have to be 100 percent comfy and easy to put on. I found that with the Teva Psyclone. Mud also comes off easily with water, leaving no stains. I bought two pair, one for the waterpark and one for nicer occasions."
2,Amazon description is incorrect,"The description on Amazon says this is an Infant sandal, but when you click on it it puts a Kids size in your cart. I didn't notice this until after I made the purchase and it was delivered. I contacted Amazon to let them know of their error, but a month later it has still not been corrected.We eventually received the correct size (infant) and they are fabulous! Easy to get on and off, they dont' slip, and they stood up to Spring Break in Orlando! I'd give the shoes themselves 5 stars."
2,Different than the original Psyclone,I've bought a pair of Teva Psyclone sandals every year for my 5.5 year old for the past 4 years. We have loved them!! The Psyclone 2 fits differently on the heel and he won't wear them. Beware if you have had Teva sandals in the past...these aren't the same.
5,The best shoes for kids,"These shoes are the best for kids no matter what age. I live in australia, & I purchased these shoes for my 2 year old last summer, & they were worn everyday, with no rubbing or compalining they were too tight. I have since purchased these shoes for my 2 nephews, and a new pair for my son ready for this summer & had them shipped to australia as well & my nephews they love them too. The kids can run in them all day & they dont slip off, can be worn in water & most of all can be adjusted on your feet when they get hot & your feet swell."
5,Great Kids Sandal,"These are excellent summer sandals for kids. Our daughter wore hers everywhere, including in water. The remained comfortable and durable. She grew out of them before she could wear them out, and except for being dirty, they looked like new when we donated them. Never any issues with the adjustable ""hook and loop"" system or snags or tears in the material. Have already purchased next years pair!"
4,Muy Bueno,"Son unas sandalias muy commodas bonitas, ideales, tanto comp ara estar en la csa asi como para ua salida esporadica a algun supermercado, parque o a la playa, a mi hijo le encantaron, el esta feliz."
1,A Lemon!,"I have been buying Teva Psyclone sandals for my kid for years. Every year, I just get a new pair in the next size. Usually, my kid wears them all summer, and then we pass them along to a younger friend for another summer's worth of wear. This particular pair was very poor quality. When we first got them, the inside sole had a defect in the rubber---a little bump of rubber poking up. I wondered then if these were defective, but I cut the little bump off with kitchen scissors and we moved on. But after less than a month of use, the sole has come entirely unglued in the toe area. This is not typical Teva quality at all. I wonder if these could be factory defects or seconds. I'm returning these today, and I'll pay more and order a new pair from REI or directly from Teva so I know what I'm getting."
2,Not what I expected,"I read the other reviews and expect more than what I recieved.Several of the Roses are missing petals.It is poorly made.The branch that circle the flowers fell out!!! It does not look real.I made a mistake of ordering this without seeing it,i relied on the reviews,but what I recieved is very poorly made for the 49.99 I paid.I am debating returning it."
1,Got a knock off?!,What I received was NOT the product shown in the photo. It came in a generic carton box and it didn't work properly. I had to order from somewhere else again.
4,Nice heavy duty watch,"I bought this for my son to replace similar watch I bought for him years ago. He's a climber, likes this style but could live without the label over the front. It's heavy duty and reliable."
1,Quality issues,"Two remarks: item not as pictured. Bright blue dial is almost black and provides little contrast to the numbers. I received my unit defective: light didn't work. I already took it abroad, so returning is not feasible anymore. It is hit or miss with these mass produced items. Overpriced."
3,prone to failure; Dakota policy not good,"We are on our second Dakota mini clip watch (bought for my husband). Neither has lasted a full year. The wind-up knob on the side fell off the first one, and I sent it back to REI no problem for a refund. Then I purchased a replacement on the Dakota website. Mistake! The second hand has now fallen off, and they will not refund my money nor send a replacement. They want me to ship it at my cost for repair AND send $9.95 for return shipping. The breakage is not- either time- the result of damage or hard treatment. Very disappointing! These are great watches otherwise; very attractive and seemingly sturdy, but the lesson here is to research the return policy of the store you buy from. Avoid the actual Dakota Watch Company like the plague."
1,Battery is NOT user replaceable,"Why would a watch be made so the user can't replace the battery?? I liked this watch...the casing seems well made, and the design is great for clipping to your belt loop. Mine stopped working after one month. Thinking it was the battery, I tried opening the back, but it is sealed shut. Looking at the booklet that came with the watch, it says you have to send it in to the maker to replace the battery, AND it will cost you at least $10. As the other reviewer mentions, after figuring in shipping, you may as well buy another watch."
1,Barely adequate,"I liked the color of this watch, and the face and hands are readable enough. But it always ran a minute or two slow. And then the paint started wearing off, and now the battery is dead after only several months, and you have to send it to the company and pay as much as $25 to have it replaced. I wouldn't want another one even if the manufacturer gave me a free replacement."
5,Love this Watch,I really love this watch. I had been looking for a clip watch for some time now and the quality of this one is wonderful. Looks great and a reasonable price. I recommend it.
2,"Nice watch, don't drop it.","I got this watch for my husband for Christmas. He loved it. That is until he dropped and now the light won't shut off and the hands don't move. It's not covered in the warrenty so I guess he'll get a new, late Christmas gift. Don't drop it."
1,Nice Watch but my 90 yo Mom is tougher,"I got this watch for my Mom for her 91st birthday. It was perfect for her, she could see it and clip it to her walker. Unfortunately she dropped it one day and the lens shattered! I am now faced with getting it replaced with something tougher than a 91 yo woman in assisted living!After taking a look at the product ""guarantee"" I am lowering my rating from 2 stars to 1. They say they only cover the watch movement and if I want to get it serviced or send it back and take a chance on their covering the broken crystal they charge $9.95 shipping plus $25 if not under warranty. Payable in advance. I can by another one for less than that."
1,Looked nice but didn't last...,"I bought this clip watch for a trip to India to help me keep track of a second timezone and clipped it to my camera bag. The paint began to chip and within a day or two it looked terrible. A week into the trip I set my bag down, not dropped, and the face popped off and both hands came loose. The led was bright and the only part that lasted. Next time I'm going to a CVS and a $5 kids watch, it'll last longer.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!!!"
1,"Unless mine's a lemon, really junky--don't buy","I've had this watch for just over two months and keep it hooked inside my backpack. Unfortunately, I've had to have it repaired twice as the hands keep coming loose and spinning freely. In short, it has been really, really undependable as a watch. Perhaps mine is defective, but I would have to advise against this watch."
1,already broken,Within two weeks of purchasing the little gear that sets the time broke off through regular use and now I cannot set time & time in wrong. I am quite disappointed in quality for amount paid.
5,Great Watch For Me,"I thought I would rate this watch since I've been wearing it every day for the past year.I bought the grey because I wear it on construction sites and it show less scratches than the other colors.It has held up great so far. I hope this review doesn't jenks it.I have carried it as an electrician working on 2 power plants.It still looks good. The spring is still strong and keeping good time. All though, I may need to replace the battery soon.Bottom line, I would buy another if something were to happen to this one."
3,watch face design,face and hands are both white making it difficult to make out the position of the hands except in very good lighting. White hands on a black face would avoid the problem
5,No problems with watch's function...,"Bought the item a little late for Christmas, but it arrived on 23rd, as promised. I got it for a friend who's only real issue between the items pictured was the color. He wanted the light tan metallic color of the one marked 'brown' in the ad. He liked the green also but the tan metallic just looked nicer. Since it arrived a little early, I decided to take a look before wrapping, and guess what, it's BROWN. Not tan, or even metallic(as shown), but plain flat brown. I told my friend who asked if it could be exchanged after Christmas, neither of us are fans of plain brown so the green will work. I realize the ad states 'brown', but I've found that, usually, the picture/color shown tends to be more accurate. Will be returning for 'green' after Christmas. Please Amazon, show a more accurate picture, buyers if the description doesn't fit picture, even slightly, ask first. My mistake is causing a lot of unnecessary holiday chaos that could have been easily avoided."
4,Pleased,I knew the book was previously owned so I took the seller's description literally and was not disappointed. Thank you. The book means a lot to me and I am on a modest income.
4,Great!,"If your new to WWII, First read WWII for Dummies, then read this book.The best thing about it is that it runs in Chronological order. (WWII for Dummies does not, but provides a great overview) Each campaign is explained in good detail but only on 2 pages,which is great. Then the same campaign is followed by 2 more pages of the events chronologically.Good pics & some maps helps you along the way."
3,Rosalind Russel Version is the Best!,This was an okay version. This was more of a musical then a movie. The Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russel is better because its more about the story. For me the story is timeless.
4,One of the best WW II biographies ever written!,"Forrester did a wonderful job writing this book in 1956. Bob Tuck shot down 29 German planes in WW II, in an amazing career that was cut short when he was shot down by flak in January, 28, 1942, and then was made a prisoner of war. He was the authentic ""fighter heroe"", a wild fighter and a great leader with accute eyesight. The narrative style of the writer is fantastic, and you read the book fastly."
2,flimsy connection,"Good piece of electronics (went through the washing machine well), but entirely too flimsy metal ring attaching it to your keychain/lanyard/etc. Nearly lost it for this reason."
1,Rip off... Beware!!,"This is a complete rip off. The product is NOT what is shown in the picture (i.e., 3 flash drive picture.) This is an old flimsy product. You can buy much bigger/better flash drive with this price. Beware!!!"
2,Disappointment,1 it isn't what was pictured.2 the key chain loop broke the next day just putting it on my key chain.So what real use is it now? What it comes down to is I have to keep it in my pocket or in my backpack so it's not easily accessible.3 Disappointment
3,Problem with the order,"I am not writing this review to rate the product because I did not have the opportunity to use it, but this is more of a warning to others. I ordered this product new from amazon but through eek technology, I received a completely different drive that what is displayed in the picture. When I tried to contact them they had told me that it was amazon's fault because they have the wrong picture displayed, and they said to exchange in they would charge me a restocking fee and I would not be covered for the shipping. Luckily Amazon was kind enough to reimburse me for the order including the shipping for the return. I just want to make sure you know about eek technology and the negative way they treat their customers."
2,Not the same flash drive as the one in the image,The flash drive they sent me does not look like the one in the picture and doesn't have the same endings which would allow it to fit easier on a key chain.
2,Different model,"Amazon.com has sent me another model different from the shown in picture, actually, the cheaper model from DaneElec. I wanted to buy the DAZMP21024 model because it looked more atractive and smaller than the one sent to me. Anyway, the one I received is fine too. I am a Amazon.com frequent buyer, and it is the first time I am not satisfied with a purchase."
4,Beautiful Story,Very poetic and beautifully written although a little bit hard to follow if you are not an avid reader.
2,Not at all what I was expecting,I purchased this book because I am from the Dominican Republic and was hoping to read this novel for the familiarity of the country. Not only was this novel very hard to follow but the description of my homeland were not as detailed as I would have hoped. I still have the novel on my kitchen table waiting to finish reading it and it's been several months. This is very hard to consider because I am a very avid reader and have never left a book unread.
3,The movie makes these oldies come to life,"You have heard all of these songs numerous times. There is nothing special about any of these 60's era standards...yet this is a good soundtrack.The movie is outstanding. It veers from comedy to suspense, slapstick to heavy drama. The songs on this soundtrack perfectly match the mood of the movie. 'Big boys don't cry"" is played to the opening where you see an intimidating gang strut their stuff. ""The Wanderer"" is played as the gang The Wanderers gathers and walks around. ""Runaround Sue"" is used when a football team turns it around and starts winning.""Baby its you"" is used during a strip poker scene.The songs are used so effectively, that now when I hear these oldies, it makes me think of scenes from this movie, and it gives a whole new life to the tunes.The soundtrack is amusing but I would get the DVD. It's the movie that is the most desireable."
2,Lionsgate Yet Again Puts Out Another Flix That's Dead On Arrival.,"Take five seemingly unrelated people, put them meeting at a Morgue, have them chased by someone with a scalpel, then chop the film to pieces & reconnect the parts any way you see fit, and that's The Morgue. Very low budget, and without giving too much away, if you needed a movie that's a poor-mans cross between The Sixth Sense and The Others, go rent this for free from Redbox like I did. Wish I didn't though...Jeez, Lionsgate really has been putting out the lamest flix lately....(RedSabbath Review:5.5/10)"
1,Visiting a real morgue would have been scarier.,"Wow, this was the worst film I have every seen.1. You figured out the ""twist"" in the opening sequence.2. The acting is horrible. The little girl was the best one.3. WHY THE H3LL WOULD A PARENT LEAVE THEIR CHILD WITH A STRANGER THEY JUST MET!!4. The pace of each scene was excruciating.5. When you have to get help... don't you normally run... not stroll through a graveyard?"
1,Arrrrgghh!,"My girlfriend and I just watched this last night. This has got to be the WORST horror movie I've ever seen (it makes Halloween 2--the Zombie remake--look awesome by comparison). Horrible acting, stupid plot and too many times you have to ask why are they doing this. Bad, bad, bad. I'm sick of horror movies. Most aren't that scary. Even the ones with a lot of gore don't interest me. This one didn't have any gore at all. Stay away from this one!"
3,Content counts,"As Burl Ives once sang, ""Watch the donut, not the hole."" To put it into this context, focus on what the people on screen are doing and saying and don't get hung up on technical quality. ""Thick As Thieves"" is a product of early 1970s British television production and is far from pristine in its picture quality. This is true of many British programs of the era, including such milestone series as ""Elizabeth R"", where the source materials were not as carefully preserved as perhaps they should have been.Like ""Elizabeth R"", this program has a disclaimer on the packaging about its technical quality. I breezed past that, though, choosing to focus on the treat of seeing John Thaw and Bob Hoskins before they were anybody. Admittedly, there are technical flaws that could be a touch distracting at times if you're obsessive about such things, but if the play's the thing for you, then you're likely to enjoy this release. It has a great premise behind it and wonderful actors carrying it out. Enjoy."
1,Very poor transfer,The quality of this DVD is terrible. It looks like it was mastered from an old VHS tape with a bad tracking problem.
3,Twang to you too,"Sometimes you can not go home again,or in this case the glory days of high school when Rebel Rouser and the birth of rock n' roll was fresh and exciting. That's the listener, Duane Eddy remains himself"
3,"Mediocre then, mediocre now","I was just beginning my music obsession in the days when Rickie Lee Jones released this album. I remember it being popular yet finding the songs, including the very-popular ""Chuck E.'s in Love"", mediocre. Over 30 years later, after hearing some of her music played in an audiophile listening session, I ordered this famous album. Hearing it again after 30 years, I was left with the same impression: mediocre. My wife thought it was nice, but to me it was and still is profoundly uninspiring. I listened to a few tracks again just now and can't give it more than three stars. That said, the audio quality is good for the year."
5,RLJ-Chuck E's in Love,"One of my faves from the greatest female artist, every song is excellent but Last Stop Texaco is one that cannot be played enough. ANYTHING that Rickie Lee Jones does is just out of this world, her talent is beyond compare."
4,Hey kids!,This is Rickie's brains before drugs .... a very good record ... now listen to the rest of the stuff Rickie Lee recorded after this one and you'll see how bad drugs can mess a person up ...
3,Midway down the CD pile,"I bought this album expecting it to be played weekly at least, based on the rave reviews.All I can say is it doesn't have a lot of staying power to me. I listened to it about 4 times. 'Chuck E' is listenable, but most of the rest got tiring. I think the lyrics aren't all that interesting, and her voice is mediocre."
2,Right handed Scissors,These are not left handed scissors in any way. Left handed scissors require the blades to be reversed for pressureto work for a clean cut.
5,Have one myself for years,"bought 2 more and gave one each to my 2 Sons , they always asked me to make copies for Schnitzel, Breads, Roladen etc for them out of mey book , now they have their own and they love it. Thanks"
5,Outstanding for use by Americans.,"This German cookbook is specially designed for use by Americans: measures, ingredients, temperatures, cuts of meat, etc. However, all of the recipes are very authenic and wonderfully traditional. One does not have to fear conjuring up some strange variation of a traditional German recipe; something that is bad enough to make a German epicurian flee from the table! Included with the recipes one will find ample text that describes the qualities and goals of the German chef, plus valuable techniques that can make all the difference between average and excellent results. There are two complete recipe indexes: English and German.For the record, I lived in Germany for a number of years, and worked with Germans in the states for many more. This is the only German cuisine cookbook that I have ever found, which is truly great in all respects."
1,UGH - NOT ONE RECIPE I WILL MAKE,Very dissappointed with the cookbook - I wish i could send it back - there is not one recipe I would consider making - I eat out alot at German restaurants and was hoping for some normal German recipes but the cookbook centers more on the meats I would never eat - UGH - Don't buy this!
1,Horrified,"I gave this as a gift. When it was opened, the pages were folded in the corners and the print was smudged. I was embarrassed beyond belief,"
5,If you're american and want to try cooking authentic german dishes...,"...then this is the book for you. The recipes are accessible; none of the weird measurements and few if any of the specialized ingredients in packets that used to always be called for in german recipes (dr.oekter). The book seems very complete, with many of the dishes my mother made or I ate in Germany as a kid. I'm not sure I like them that much, it's heavy and bland for my taste - if I were in Germany I'd just eat sausages and bretszeln - which this book doesn't have recipes for, since in Germany you'd buy them at specialty stores (well, it's been more than 10 years, things might have changed)"
3,german food cook book,"regular german food cook book , with no pictures at all , easy to undertand , it is ok ."
5,Solid German fare,"My wife and I are both of German-English extraction. While I wouldn't go to the UK for food, Germany is full of gastronomical wonders, and most of them are in this book. It's definitely a keeper, with a permanent place in our kitchen."
2,Kindle version subpar,"The kindle version of this book leaves much to be desired. It's riddled with typos, in particular when it comes to numbers. Things like 1 1/2 (one-and-a-half) have been scanned as 1/2, so you always need to be on your toes when following the directions. These typos would be fine in a novel, but are the worst mistakes possible in a cookbook. Lack of an index and a complete recipe list also make the kindle edition very difficult to use--you have to flip many pages one by one to get to the recipe you want, which, with e-ink refresh speeds, is ridiculous.That said, there is a lot of recipes here, and the writing style is to my liking: assumes that you know your way around the kitchen, doesn't baby you, leaves room for improvisation and substitution of ingredients, and displays solid knowledge of the cuisine. I suspect I would enjoy using a printed version of this book."
5,Excellent Book,I have bought two of these books. My wife is German so a lot of the recipes she already knows but they make great gifts to those who like great food.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to cook. Order withNorpro Stainless Steel Spaetzle Makerand you'll be set. Thanks Amazon for the great service
4,Great Sauerbraten Recipe,"I had been searching for the perfect Sauerbraten recipe and I found it in this cookbook! I modified it to my taste, since I don't like it too sour and it turned out fabulous. I'm not into some of the recipes, ie pigs feet, etc. But they did have a good recipe for Kartoffel Knoedel and Spaetzele as well."
1,Too Much Crammed Onto One Page,"I saw this book at a local shop and thought, ""Wow! What a great gift!"" (for a soon-to-be-born neice or nephew). Unfortunately, this book has fit four, original pages onto two, ""Treasury"" pages. Something truly gets lost in the translation. The type is too small and the illustrations are difficult to fully appreciate.I returned the book to the shelf and am in the process of ordering some of the originals from amazon.com instead."
5,A Must for Your Child's Library Treasury,"Robert McCloskey writes stories that should be in your child's experience. Individual books are wonderful, but an anthology is convenient and contains the jewels of an author. McCloskey's stories are appropriate for little ones up to grade schoolers. I love to give this book to siblings when a new baby comes."
5,Great Product,"I have a 175lb Old English Mastiff and during a dog fight one of his main tendons in his back leg tore (the one that controls his paw and keeping it flat so it doesnt curl up) he has had issues with that back leg since. We took him for hip xrays and his hips are good, it's just that leg. I've tried a lot of different products and for the price this one is just as good as the expensive supplements. He does get 4 a day to start and I will back him down to 3 a day and see how that works for him and then 2... He gets these pills with 3-4 asprin a day to help with the pain along with 2 Fish Oils(human) to help give an extra boost in vitamins and supplements. Without these pills and the asprin the poor guy wouldnt be able to walk. I highly recommend this product! I will be purchasing again!"
5,Fenris Loves It,"I bought these tablets for my 8 month old Great Dane, Fenris. He is a handful and growing very fast. If you know much about Great Danes you know how fast they grow. As he is my 2nd Great Dane I am concerned with his joint health also. I purchased these tablets as a preventative for joint health problems. I do have to say that Fenris absolutely loves them. I have even used them as a once a day treat to teach him to shake and sit. He looks forward to them every day. When I shake that bottle he knows what time it is.I like the fact that these pills have the Glucosamine and Chondroitin to aid in joint health. The only problem I have with them is the smell. These tablets absolutely stink, but hey, I'm not the one eating them, Fenris is and HE LOVES THEM!!!Matthew and FenrisWinfield, TN1-800-PetMeds Super Joint Enhancer Chewable Tablets 120ct"
5,28 Degrees by the end of the show.,"One of the greatest concerts I have ever been to. Whipping just all out rocked! Great versions of Faithfull, Dissident, SOLAT, Go. Off He Goes has an awesome solo by Mike. THE BEST!"
4,"Subtle, Elegant","Most of the chapters of this book begin with funerary monuments--of two men, or two women, who wanted to be buried together. Bray concludes that in pre-modern times, when life was lived more in public, and it was common for people to sleep in the same bed, the intimacy of friends was much greater than it is today, and was suffused with rituals, especially derived from Holy Communion. Were these relationships sexual? Probably yes, Bray concludes, but that isn't exactly the point, since that's a question we moderns are much more interested in than they were. It's more about how friendship has changed. The argument is subtle, and elegant--my one complaint is that sometimes the prose is too sinuous, when simple declaration would suffice. Some reviewers have even missed the point--they suggest that the friendships were NOT sexual, which isn't what Bray says at all. Incidentally, there's a terrific review of the book in the London Review of Books."
2,Hannah Arendt was right,"It's both bizarre and a little bit scary to see such a sympathetic prortrait of Hitler these days. Watching it does help you to understand what Hannah Arendt meant went she spoke of ""the banality of evil"", but it also makes you wonder how the producers could make a film that portrayed Hitler with none of the context of the world he tried to create. Scary."
3,Ho Hum,"I got the impression it was more about filling time, surely not the best work on the subject."
3,Great once through the fisrt half,Well I think the title really says it all. The second half of the book was fantastic! But it was really hard for me to get through the fist part of the book. It was just really long and dry. But still very worth a read.
5,"A really good, if innacurate book.","This was much better than I expected! While this book had a great plot and really filled in some details about Que-Shu customs, and Riverwind and Goldmoon's relationship, the authors really screwed up some details. Hollow Sky was NOT Loreman's eldest child, Hawker was. Also, Wanderer was not supposed to be Riverwinds father, he was actually his 'adoptive grandfather' as explained in the book 'Love and War'. Also, while 'Dragons of Autumn twilight' states that Goldmoon and Riverwind are in their late twenties, in this book it says that Riverwind is barely 20 years (Goldmoon is younger than Riverwind) and was gone 11 months before he returned to Que-shu, making him at most 21, so unless they traveled to the inn of the last home over a span of 9 years (which I doubt) There are some problems here. These details probably won't bother anyone, but just in case..."
4,Riverwind the Plainsman is surprisingly good!,"When I bought this book, my first thought was that it would be a story of Riverwind's journey to Xak Tsaroth and would probably not fit into the Chronicles timeline. I was wrong on both thoughts. The book is very well written and the characters are good. (although I wasn't much impressed by Catchflea, and there is a long draggy point of walking through endless tunnels.) The story is like two books in one: first Riverwind journies to an undergound city of lost elves and participates in their rebellion against an evil elven sorceres, (Li El has to be one of the most evil villians I have ever read about) and then he journies to Xak Tsaroth to battle draconians and Khisanth the black dragon. It tied in very well with the series and explained why Riverwind couldn't remember the adventure. I know most people say that the preludes stink, but this one doesn't. Pick it up if you were as curious as me about Riverwind's lost quest that was wiped from his memory."
5,I find it a superb book! Its a MUST.,"This book shows aspects of dragonlance new to us, like more detailed information about the que-shu tribe and the refugees of the kinslayer war. I find it the best book of the preludes sextet. The book is very detailed and fascinated me in such a way that I couldn't stop reading it until I finished the book."
3,"Weak, as the prequels go",This book just never leaped out like many of the others in the series. It was slow moving a actually boring at times. Not at all on the level with the main series (though this is true for most of the prequels). I'd only recommend it to the hardcore Dragonlance fa
1,It is unfortunate that this book was ever published.,"This is one of the worst book that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Not only was it poorly written (and proofread--as many TSR novels seem to be) from a technical aspect, but the characters and events were poorly thought out. This book shames (as can be expected) the Weis & Hickman books."
1,Nothing to Offer...But it Past the Time,"This is not a good book. The plot was simple and unexciting. I never once found myself eager to find out what happened next. The way things unraveled were horrible. The climax was boring, there was no mystery, and a lot of filler. The characters were uninspired. I did not connect with any of the characters and did not care what happened to them. This book is not written well. It seemed rushed. I will think twice about reading anything by Paul Thompson. Dragonlance was looking for a way to sell a book...instead they sold me crap....."
3,Not bad... but not good either.,"I finished this book just recently. It has a relatively interesting story which kept my attention, but it was not exactly a page turner. It did a good job of portraying Riverwind, gully dwarves, draconians, and still fitting in with the storyline for the most part. Unfortunately, too much of the book is centered around the underground elves. The book should have been about Riverwind in Xak Tsaroth, not some band of elves that are never heard from again.The characters are forgettable and I really didn't care very much what happened to them. It even did a good job tying up all the loose ends at the end of the book. The only problem is, I think a good book should surprise you and present you with characters you really care about and want to know about. This book didn't really get over the average book hill in my opinion."
2,BLA BLA BLA,"sorry for all those ppl that like this book, i didn't i thought it was going to be about finding the true gods but it was only a small part of the story and and most of the story could only discrieb as BLA BLA BLA u won't find out nothing new or exiting in it so pass"
3,Secret Finish,"This product definitely is a secret to me. I put this on and, its a sheerish gloss/gel, when I went to Neiman Marcus to try it out and I looked and looked at my skin in their mirrors and then when I came back to work I looked to see if I could see any difference. It just looked like I had a little shimmer, if at all. I can barely tell. I tapped it on my face just like the directions said over my make up. I suppose its supposed to make my make up last but since I put the Secret Finish on in the middle of the day its hard to tell if my make up lasted any longer or not. Frankly it looks like it always looks. Maybe you will have better luck than me with this product, I will not buy it."
5,Good sturdy table - has been redesigned,"Previous comments indicated that the legs were in two pieces, which was of concern to me. However, I was very pleased when the package arrived and discovered that the company has redesigned the table and I'm not seeing any of the issues previously complained about.The legs are now one solid piece each, and the sides have been pre-assembled. Only the top and the two long sidebars need to be attached together.Be aware that the plugs for covering the screw holes are loose in the package, and that the screws are in a small plastic bag. Be sure to shake out the box before recycling it."
1,Don't buy it,You really can't tell from the photo but the legs are in two pieces. I had to force a couple of them together and one of them split. I nailed it together and contacted the seller over a week ago and still no responce...
2,Cheap construction,"I looked all over the Internet for a table similar to this, and this one is the only one I could find. It arrived damaged but could be repaired with some scrap wood and wood glue. Overall for the money, the table is flimsy and not well made at all. I would gladly have paid more money for something similar and of better quality, but I could find nothing comparable. I'm using it, but the minute I find something nicer, it's going out with the trash."
2,Poor workmanship but hideable and fits the purpose,"When I first started to put the table together, I thought that the legs had some decorative beveling on them, but a slightly closer inspection revealed that one leg had one corner shaved off along most of the length. I also discovered a crack in another leg. Both of these could be faced to the back of the unit though, so it looks fine. I'd have to say that I'm rather disappointed overall, but it does fit the purpose and the problems can't be easily seen."
1,CRAP,"I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS TOILET TANK TABLE, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY CRAP. THE WOOD IS ALL CHIPPED AND SCRATCHED AND THE SCREWS WON'T EVEN SCREW IN- THEY JUST KEEP TURNING AND TURNING BUT WILL NOT CATCH TO HOLD. IT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!!!"
3,Good for small bathrooms,"Cheap quality, the wood split while trying to screw this together. My husband had to use wood glue and C-clamps to repair the damaged cross-piece. It is the only table I could find that fits over a toilet and would work in my small bathroom. It looks better than putting baskets of things on top of the toilet. I ordered this item directly from Get Organized, warning if you live on the West Coast and order from this company. It took them 18 days from the order date to delivery of this item. They ship via FedEx Ground and something called USPS Smartpost. The package sat around in FedEx NJ and WV warehouses before they bothered to drive it across the country, then instead of delivering it to my door, FedEx drops it off at my local Post Office where it sat around for a few more days until the mail carrier left it on my stairs with no signature requested. Luckily the item was OK inside the beat up box."
2,"Right Style, Wrong Quality","Even though I read the other bad reviews for this product, I hoped that the most recent report that the product had been improved was true, because I couldn't find a similar table anywhere else. It is the perfect size and simple style that meets my needs, but believe what you read...this is a very low quality item. The product I received was missing parts the pre-drilled holes did not match up, so the construction is very loose. The finishing covers for the screw holes were not included and the company is virtually unreachable. After calling 3 numbers that were ""out of service"", I finally got someone on the phone who promptly hung up on me! I am very dissatisfied."
1,Very Flimsy,"Table wobbles, very cheaply made from cheap pressed wood. Think twice about buying this, there are others."
5,EXOTIC EAST-ENDER,"This was Vocalion's first Geraldo compilation, and I have to admit to a particular fondness for it, because it encapsulates Geraldo's flamboyant personality. Here in Geraldoland you'll find his Gaucho Tango Orchestra, his Sweet Music, and his Dance Orchestra. Monte Rey is featured on five tracks, Al Bowlly on two, and Eve Becke on one, but it's Cyril Grantham who takes the lion's share of the vocals. Recordings span the middle to late thirties, and needless to say the transfers are excellent."
4,Thurough Overview of the Catholic Faith,We use this book with our RCIA process. It gives a good overview of the Catholic Faith. Fr. Hardon has taken the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) and paraphresed it in shorter form. He holds to the order and layout of the CCC and even references every paragragh to it making it simpole to do further study on any topic you are reading. This is great for the Catholic who wants to know more about their faith or for those who do not understand Catholicism and want a clear overview.
4,Nice grips for beginners,"The velcro on the grips works well for a while, but needs to be adjusted often during workouts. After these we went to a buckle style, which stays in place better. the leather is very softm, so do not buy them too large as they did stretch."
5,Great product,Very good quality product. Exactly as described . I Would recommend this product to any parent of a beginning gymnast.
1,bar grips,We ordered 2 sets of these. Both my girls said that they don't fit properly and it is difficult to grasp the bar. They must be worn with a soft pad on the wrist area or the child will develop ulcers from the velcro on their arm. I wish we had tried one pair at a time or not bought them at all.
4,Good read,What is a 'bomb' book/ Haven't heard that one yet. I also read this fast. Sometimes they seem to repeat things but I guess that's becuase its a series. Another good horse book is Shadow Horse by Alison Hart. A good mystrey. Try it!
5,This book was very good.,I loved the way the charachers were portraied in this book. I love anything to do with horses. Bonnie Bryant you did an awsome job.
2,what the hell?,"Ok, i like Pine Hollow books and all...but comeon! This book is a clear illustration of why 50 year old authors shouldn't write books about teenagers. Would average teenagers freak out because they found a beer in the fridge? It was like they were scared of it. And then the next minute totally turn around and get drunk, and EVERYONE was drunk. At highschool parties there is always alcohol, but that doesn't mean that everyone gets totally drunk. By describing how teenagers will get completely trashed when in the presence of alcohol Bonnie Bryant isn't giving teenagers much credit;it's like she is saying we have no idea about right and wrong, nor does she show an understanding of real teenage issues. i suggest the author stick to horses, (isn't that what the book is supposed to be about?) and not something she is obvioiusly clueless about."
4,Alaskan adventure,"Hank McCloskey is a man torn between his love of the sea and fishing with the love of his family. His wife Jody fished the seas with him until they started their family. Three children later, Hank feels a distance growing between them and his desire to be at sea. Trouble comes in patches, Hank over extends their finances by buying a new boat and building a new house. Suddenly their baby boy becomes ill on the heels of a devasting season of crabbing. Faced with mounting debts and pressures, Hank must decide whether to join forces with the Japanese knowing this will strain friendships with other skippers or facing the possible loss of his boat. He is put to the test business wise and personal wise. This book did a great job of getting you to feel and experience the love of the sea fisherman have. I liked the depth and exploration into Hank and Jody's relationship. I'm a land locked Midwesterner who fell in love with this book. Enjoy!"
5,Read highliners first,This is a continuation from the book highliners and the life of hank crawford.This continues to follow hank as his family grows and he takes on further progress by purchasing a bigger and better boat but along with this comes more bills to pay and eventually some tough decision which may be good for business and to make bills it is tough on old friendships.The author does a terrific job in both these books while they are fiction they seem to be very acurate with fishing descriptions both this book and the first (highliners) are excellent reads
4,Next Best Thing To Being There!,"An excellent story, well written and done in a manner that allows the reader to 'experience' the moment. Accurately describes the Asian attitude and gives good insight as to how and why the Japanese in particular do business in a way that is certainly foreign to most Americans. The Japanese 'method' is not right or wrong, just different from the American 'method'.Read 'Highliners' first, then 'Breakers'."
4,"You say pollock, I say pollack","I would just like to point out, concerning the review below, that Webster's dictionary definition lists ""pollack or pollock"" as the correct spelling. Here's what it reads: ""Pollack or pollock: 1 -- a commercially important north Atlantic food fish (Pollachius virens) related to and resembling the cods but darker. 2 -- a commercially important northern Pacific food fish (Theragra chalcogramma) of the cod family that closely resembles the pollack -- called also walleye pollack."""
2,Nice but incorrect fitting guide,The fitting guide does not take length of hand/fingers into account so the size it said would fit my daughter is too small.
3,Dame La Vesselina,"Not being a house-hold name in opera, Vesselina Kasarova astounds at why she is not. Listening to her sing is the best argument why she should be.For a diva interpreting male roles, she shows how it should be done: with bravado and passion. Her voice is rich, powerful, and versatile in seizing an aria, and giving it life and soul. Her singing leaps between the mezzo and contralto ranges, flies in imaginative energy, and quickly transfixes on the stage. Her style brings to opera a flamboyant blend of baroque cabaret, high theater, and irresistible drama. Not only she hits the right notes, but also the right dramatic cords in the music. In ""Venga Pur Minacci e Frema"", she does not pull any stops, and wields her singing in anger, angst, and resolve at a palette of vocal range that is colorful as complex. And on a snap, she can transform the strionics of singing in allegro into the reflective and tragic tones of the adagios...just an amazing artist and talent!"
1,Dreadful!,"The product description refers to the ""high quality sound"" of this disc. They must be joking! 'Because They're Young', for one, has never sounded WORSE. I don't know what they've done to this classic track which has always sounded great in stereo on other CDs. The mix is barely recognisable here against the original single release. Same thing goes for 'Forty Miles Of Bad Road'...horrible. I could also have done without the fake stereo on 'Rebel Rouser', a track which was only ever recorded in mono. Avoid this CD and get the Bear Family comp instead. They are streets apart."
2,Tom Moulton Mix?,Used to be that a Tom Moulton Mix was the ultimate. Not here - I echo other reviewer comments that the Bear Family mixes from the 1994 box set are far superior - dynamically superior - more bass etc.As to the timing on this set - Jamie is neither Ace nor Bear Family - minimal value for $$$.
2,boring book,"You can pass the class without this book as long as your instructor uses blackboard. Most useless book, boring to read, unexciting, common sense information, ans reads like a novel instead of a text book. It was cheaper than the campus price, but still not worth $5.00."
4,Less USA would raise the value,The book has been purchased as a suitability test for non-Dutch Health professionals. The book suits the purpose though the especially the first chapter is too much focussed on the USA situation. So we will skip chapter one in using the book. The price of the book is reflected in the use of extremely cheap paper.
1,Horrible pics - bad software,"Bad, bad, bad... every pic is out of focus. The camera doesn't remember settings when you shut it off. If you set the camera for auto flash and high quality pics - when you shut it off and turn it off - THE SETTINGS ARE GONE! That, in and of itself is not the end of the world... but the fact that this thing can't take a decent picture is the reason this baby is going back!"
2,disappointed,"many problems, it is too heavy/bulky/clumsy to transport or use on your lap, must be on the floor where it is awkward to reach. Worst part is the dull flat sound, more of a thud than anything musical."
5,Zilactin,This is a wonderful product that is hard to find. Helps out alot before and after dental work.Thank goodness for amazon.com. I received my order in just a few days. Thanks Amazon!
5,a great book for the foreign investor,This is one of the most insightful books i have ever read. His chapter on investing in precious metals was very insightful. I have already made a few thousand dollars by using the island investment theory. I thought his bold views on options was excellent
3,ok for a beginner,"This book is all right for a beginner, but is flawed when it comes to practical application."
4,Good Book overall,"I read this one a while ago, and would have to say that it's a great trek novel. I'm a fan of tng, and was unsure of a few tos things, but you figured it all out in the end like you should. I really liked the flashbacks to Dr.Soong. They were like another short story going on at the same time.This book was written for Star Trek fans, and it might be a little more confusing if you're not."
4,This is a Well Written Star Trek Novel,Jeffrey Lang did a good job writing this book. I think he wove the various sub-plots together quite nicely. He certainly is an author I will look for in the future.
3,Fun Read for TNG Fans,"This is one of the better Star Trek books. The author tried really hard (perhaps too hard!) to pull together lots of plot lines from TOS and TNG, and succeeded for the most part. It's readable and enjoyable."
3,A strong Data book,"I like Data, and this book took a nice twist on him and explored all artificial life forms in the Star Trek universe, which was a nice surprise."
2,Highly Overrated,"Many die hard Trek book fans loved this book. Well, I think you need to be a die hard fan to love it. While I enjoy references to past episodes in Trek books, I felt I was often missing half of the story by not being intimatly familiar with every episode from the different Trek series referenced here. Further, some stilted writing, gob-smaking stupid plot sequences, and some rather poor proof-reading took away from the enjoyment value of this book."
3,entertaining,This Star Trek book is similar to most of the others I have read. It was an easy read and it kept my interest throughout.
5,Couldn't put it down,"A mystery, a meditation on immortality, a character-driven novel about one of the most interesting Star Trek characters, a romance, and a bang-up SF action adventure--all rolled into one book. There were parts of this that were so good that they literally gave me shivers.As with most ST novels, you have to have watched the show--it's not a primer for the ST newbie, although Lang makes a good faith effort to remind readers (or introduce them) to all the minor characters that appeared in single episodes...and this book has bunches of them; it ties together, in a convincing and compelling fashion, pretty much every android and artificial intelligence that has cropped up in the Star Trek universe.This is one of the few novels I've read recently that as soon as I closed the book, I wanted a sequel. It's just that good."
4,Immortality Reborn,Immortal Coil brings the reader back to the days of good original Star Trek paperbacks. For the longest time if you wanted to read a decent S.T. novel you would have to read the newest HC. Immortal Coil breaks the STTNG string of unimaginative and superficial STTNG paperback books which have been the basis of all the publishing over the past 10 years. The story is well plotted. And other than a couple of minor quibles about some minor things done in the book. There are no big gapeing plot holes that tend to riddle the entire ST book line.
4,Pretty Good!,"This CD single has three remixes of the song ""Danger! High Voltage"". The first track is the Soulchild 12"" Blitz Mix. This the best remix and is easily worth the whole CD. It's pretty much an extended version of the original song with dance interludes thrown in. The second remix is the Thin White Duke Mix. This one is good, even though it sounds nothing like the original ""Danger! High Voltage"". It's has a catchy tune and powerful beat that still goes with the lyrics. The third track is the Kilogram Remix. This one is my least favorite of the three. It's basically a combination of the tune of ""Danger! High Voltage"" with an 80's rap beat. The two may sound okay by themselves, but they don't go good together. Overall, this is a decent single. I would get it just for the awesome Soulchild remix, if nothing else."
4,Radio Kit,"This kit was not too hard to build but not too easy either. I built it when we studied the invention of the radio. Not all the stations come in, but a couple come in clearly. It was very fun."
2,a little lacking,This was fun for my son to put together. I had fun watching. But when we were done we couldn't hear anything on it. So it is a great activity to do with your children but no reward when you get it done.
4,Steve Burt Hits Home,"Boo! These stories are ""Wicked Odd."" They chill the bone as Steve creates fantastic scary stories for all ages!"
3,Emblem,Looks okay for the price but I was expecting more double sided tape on the back for longer lasting adhesion.
1,This book should come with a warning,"This book is for Actionscript 1.0!!!! Let me say that again, THIS BOOK IS FOR ACTIONSCRIPT 1.0!!!! Do not buy this if you have the letest version of Flash MX 2004 with actionscript 2.0. Up until the 9th chapter or so it woks alright. After that it all falls apart. The excersises become almost impossible because of the difference between the two versions. I bought this book based on the reviews writen on this site. None mentioned this fact so I am writing this so that anyone else who looks at this book is aware right away. Wait for an updated book. This really should be pulled or a warning should be put somewhere that this is not for the latest version. I hope that I can save someone else some money buy letting them know eactly what is in this book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!! (Unless you are still using actionscript 1.0, in which case disregard everything I have said here today)"
2,Author Got a Little Lost in Own Steps,"I'll be brief. It teaches efficient programming and good tips for beginner programmers but don't try to follow the steps outlined in the book. Seems that author got lost in his own steps. For example page 144 step 8 doesn't indicate that you should place the onChanged code in the ""calcObject.as"" file, instead it says that you sould place it after the onKillFocus event. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out why my program wasn't working (wanting to practice debugging) until I finally looked at the files in the DVD. I'd say just read the book and test using the files that came in the DVD if things don't work."
3,Poorly Written,"My disappointment with this book is it lacks natural flow. I found myself drifting out of thought because the book has you shuffling files around every other page. I also share the discouraging fact that you must work through six chapters (half the book) before you are really engaged in ""Application Development"".There seems to be a rash of poorly written books emerging under the heading of Flash MX 2004 - 2004 Pro and the best way to gage the relevancy of a new book before you buy it is to see how well the resale price is holding up in the used book market. If the price has dropped significantly after the release, you probable should buy something else or buy it used so you do not end up kicking yourself later. This one is already half of its list price; could it be that only half of it is worth paying for?"
1,Hate it,"Picked up this book years ago and hated it. Macromedia should be ashamed of how bad this book is. You would think a company can turn out a decent instructional book about their own product! After conversing with many people in the Information Architecture and Web Usability fields, I am discovering that many do not find Macromedia books in general to be helpful, especially when compared to others in the market. As for me, I will never buy another book published by Macromedia."
1,"This is just a 12"" ruler",They labeled it as a 30cm ruler which is confusing since most rulers are listed in inches. Much cheaper deals on amazon than this.
4,at last,"i stumbled upon this album in 1970 while working at a record store in nyc since then it has been a mainstay in my collection and the collection of all my friends, i have worn out a fewi also have seen jake and the family jewels at maxs kansas city long closed great album every song different,from girl from france do wop, to great clarinet of perry robinson on oh pearlno matter the price i have searched for a replacementand finally found it"
2,Not as Informative as It Could Be,"This video should have been called ""100 Sailing Mistakes and a Handful of Production Mistakes and How Not To Avoid Them."" Although it does describe 100 sailing mistakes, it goes through them too quickly for a beginner to follow. It's advice on how to avoid them is often nearly non-existent. For example, one mistake listed is not knowing what the lights on channel markers mean. The video's instruction for how to avoid this is to go learn what they mean. There is some entertainment value in the numerous production errors, such as the numerous stills of an upside-side down chart, and the narrator who confuses jib with jibe, tack with 'jack', and mis-pronounces words as adage."
2,4 mistakes a minute,"What works well on paper does not work well in DVD. To see what happens when people don't understand this simple fact see the exhibit A: ""100 Sailing mistakes DVD"".There is nothing terrible wrong with this production except that it shouldn't have beem made into movie, it would have made a terrific little reference or a booklet. As a movie it doesn't work at all, the whole thing consists of sporadic scenes of a presumable experienced sailor introducing us to a new chapter of mistakes, and then someone in a hurried voice reads a mistake and solution to the said mistake over some pseudo nautical screen saver.I actually timed it, the tempo is ~4 mistakes/solutions a minute administered in a monotonous voice without real understanding at what is being said.This is sad because the information actually is not that bad, I learned quite a few new things.I also fell asleep between mistake #35 I think, and woke up around mistake #60-ish.Rent it if you must, don't bother purchasing."
3,Not much to talk about,I guess you don't get much for 8.99 these days. Felt like I should have paid 89 cents for this MP3. Too much reference to other materials he has out there.
2,Twice Disappointed,"I was excited to find this book when it first appeared in the Amazon catalog. I loved Mr. Fischer's previous titles and have bought many duplicates to give to friends and family. Unfortunately, these stories are neither very interesting nor inventive. In fact, they bare more resemblance to filler articles in more-upscale magazines. Furthermore, I'd purchased the identical collection earlier which bore the title ""Don't Read This Book If You're Stupid"". If you're a fan, buy it used and don't expect too much. I still have both copies........"
3,"Not great, but mildly interesting.","I just finished this book. I liked the mood set by this book. Each story was an addition to this book being a complete book about failure. The characters were depressing, as well as the stories, but each had its dark humor. I think the big problem with these stories was the inexperience of this author in writing short stories. Most of these stories seemed to drag on a bit and this made the book seem a bit more boring than it should have. All together worth reading, but nothing spectacular here."
2,"Boo, hiss","Shame, shame on Tibor. I have read two of his other books and was very anxious to get to this one. In it I found a relentless, remorseless creation of despair. Despair is the greatest sin there is, and Fischer is so skilled that he can come close to making you buy some of what he digs up here. He makes his characters suffer and writes convincingly enough so that we beleive that this is the world we live in. It isn't. It is a lie, and a lie that could lead to the greatest sin. Fischer needs to find his heart."
2,i like being bored,"Well, it was mildly amusing, but overall the titles are much more interesting than the stories. Reading this book was like being at a bar where your friend is talking up this guy and you're stuck talking to his friend and he's ok, but you know this isn't going anywhere and you think, ""should I just leave?"" but then your friend will be mad because she doesn't want to be left at the bar by herself; last time that happened she had to call you the next afternoon and ask if you knew where her bra went to, and, although you didn't know, you assumed it was now hanging on the rearview mirror of the 72 Nova you saw her get in with that guy wearing the brown leather bomber jacket. No, you're not responsible for her bad behavior, but you like her and don't want her to get killed, and this guy isn't _so_ bad, but you're wasting your time, basically. Two stars for killer titles, though."
4,It's HYUUUGE,"It's big and bulky, and it's not always convenient (photo backpacks never really are), but it holds aqnd protects an enormous amount of stuff and, when properly adjusted, it rides quite comfortably. I enjoy shooting waterfalls, and moving water in general, so there's a fair amount of rockhopping involved...over, through, and sometimes in streams, rivers, ponds, and surf. I've adjusted the pack to fit very snugly, and I've never felt out of balance or uncomfortable with as much as 35 lb. of gear on me in those situations, so I'm able to get into some reasonably remote locations and really work on a scene with all my tools."
3,waterproof but VERY difficult to open,"I bought the Lowepro DryZone 200 for a raft trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. On the plus side, the bag is very well designed for camera and lens storage. There are lots of interior pockets for extra batteries and other gear. And the bag when properly zipped up is quite waterproof. However, I needed to stow my camera during the larger rapids and then retrieve it for the stunning landscape that was passing by. I found the waterproof zipper to be very difficult to work. I followed the directions and used the grease/goop that was provided: first upon receiving the bag and then twice during the 8 day trip. It didn't seem to help much. The zipper was extremely difficult to move. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this bag for anyone who needs to get access to the camera/lenses more than once a day."
5,The best of the best,I consider this and the dryzone 300 as the best of the best. It does take some routine lubing the waterproof seal but well worth the effort. I keep some silca packets inside the top mesh pocket and this helps keep things dry. I've used these on the worst winter rain/snow days and they retain heat inside. There are several straps for hand carrying or backpack style.I personally prefer to carry over one shoulder.
3,"Very large, definitely totally waterproof","This is a nice bag. But it is enourmous. It sticks way out from your body in the back. It is very hard to open the waterproof section, as the zipper sticks. As i was returning it i did not lube the zipper as suggested. The yellow is a nice color. The other reviews said that they had tested the pack in water rich conditions and it was true that it was impenetrable by water. Just too big."
1,Zippers go bad very soon,"I think the advertisements sound great and it is surely a good pack. However, I wondered why in our town none of the professional photography shops offer this item. Talking to them I learned that the zippers of this backpack series go bad - depending on the amount of use - within a year or two. The manufacturer replaces the pack without any problems; however, do you really want to deal with this? In addition, while zippers are waterproof, they are hard to handle; some people ended up just ripping them out when attempting to open or close them. No recommendation to buy this item. Go and talk to your local dealer, especially if you are living in an area that is prone for harsh conditions, and ask them about what they think about the pack before buying it."
2,Very poor quality videocassette,"I first saw this film in the early 1960's at the cinema in Lambertville, New Jersey. I next saw it in the mid 1960's at the Fillmore East Theater in Greenwich Village. I concur with all the reviewers that it is a magnificent film. The unique reason for my two star rating is that the Kultur videocasssette is of miserable quality. In particular the intentionally surreal visual aspects of the film, as Rouleau explicity says in the printed introduction, are ruined by the cropping of the film in this videocassette release. It was released as a wide screen film and in some scenes, specifically the one of the eerie man circling her on his bicycle as he spits cigarette buts at her, has its visual impact ruined, because one can not see him repeatedly making the full circle. This film cries out for a Criterion reissue and it amazes me that this has not occurred as yet."
2,poor quality,This movie was not good from a number of standpoints. The subtitling (done in white) was barely able to be seen throughout the movie. The plot was mildly interesting. It seemed at times the movie was trying to emulate a Bollywood style when breaking into song and dance but did not do a very good job.
5,Phil Collins review,"This is a great video of one of the greatest artists of our time. The video and audio quality are exceptional and I could listen to it for hours. So sad he no longer performs live, but this is about as close as you can get."
3,"Good text, bad photos.","This book has detailed written instructions for hairpin lace, but the photos are terrible(white thread is washed out in most of the B&W photos, showing no contrast between stitches, many photos look like indistinguishable blobs) and the illustrations are crudely drawn. This is also not a beginner's book, you must already know how to do basic crochet before using this book as it does not cover basic stitches and techniques at all. I only recommend this book if you already know what you are doing and just want some more ""advanced"" design ideas, and can find a copy cheaply."
2,Matters of choice by Noah Gordon:,"Having read The Physician, the first book in this trilogy, I was looking forward to reading this book. The Physician was a work of literary merit. It had all the hallmarks of a classic, in the same genre as Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett. The historical research in The Physician was thorough and well explained. This book had none of that, although it was a readable story. Quite disappointing."
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"If this had been Noah Gordon's first novel, I don't think he would have sold it. Poor plotting, worn-out rhetoric, lame characterization. Coming as it does on the heels of such masterpieces as ""The Physician"" and ""Shaman,"" this book is a complete let-down. I agree with the reviewers who said that he really hits his stride much better with historical fiction. He just doesn't seem comfortable in a present-day story, and it is too bad, because he is a very gifted storyteller.If you were enthralled by ""The Physician""and ""Shaman,"" spare yourself the disappointment of ""Choices."" Remember Noah Gordon's storytelling as it used to be."
2,Not up to Mr. Gordon' s usual standards,"I was very disappointed in this book. I loved The Physician and Shaman, and looked forward to the final ""chapter"" in this trilogy. But I found this book did not ""fill the bill"". The character of Roberta Cole was, I felt, poorly developed -- I could not identify nor sympathize with her. I mostly just found her annoying. In fact, I didn't learn enough about any of the characters to feel I ""knew"" them by the end of the book. The most interesting part of the whole book was when David was relating his experiences with the Jewish scholars at Kidron. Mr. Gordon was infinitely more interesting writing about the past than about modern medicine, and perhaps more accurate. As a nurse with an obstetrical background, I found the childbirth sequence unrealistic ---- I have never seen anyone scream with the contractions that occur while the placenta is being delivered!"
1,SHAME ON YOU MR GORDON!!,"having read and loved and admired THE PHYSICIAN i sat down in anticipation of a great read..a total disappointment..weak plot, boring characters..and all the expected cliches...re: country doctors.abortion,trite friendships and love affairs.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT... having expected oh!so much more..a 'phone it in ' book and a waste of money..""the gift"" which played so well in the previous novels, was ill used ...and, i think only as a back cover ploy to get readers to buy this claptra"
3,A disappointing finish to an awesome saga,"Althought it is a good book, it does not fulfill the expectations I had after reading the first two books of the saga of the Cole family. This book is not as epic as ""The Physician"" and its sequel ""Shaman"". It is just a simple novel about a (female) doctor in the 20th century, dealing with the problems of a doctor in the 20th century."
2,A bit of a deception compared to the first two books,"The first two books of the Cole trilogy are awesome compared to the last one. This last book has no real adventure, not much historical background and little to the plot. The main character is constantly embroiled in life torments and finds refuge in her garden or forest. In the first books, Cole (the ancestors) are winner. In this book Cole (she) is a bit of a think small, affected by controversy about abortion rights, lost in the meanders of unrealistic love relationship. The book ends weird with her getting pregnant. I really enjoyed the first two books. They are really awesome much of the same class as ken follett or even Zola. Not this last one."
2,Disappointment,This book did not live up to his other books. It was a romance novel with no connection with the other two books of the Cole Trilogy. It was a great disappointment.
5,Matters of Choice,"Like all the books in the Cole family series, this is fully absorbing. It's a great blend of science, issues, and humanity in all its strengths and frailties. I couldn't put it down."
2,Review,"This book was very disappointing. I read the trilogy,loved the Physician and the Shaman, both very good reads. I am looking forward to the forthcoming movie. I felt the story line for Matter of Choice was weak.Main character not as dynamic as the main characters I the previous novels. Highly recommend the first and second booksin the trilogy."
4,I loved it...........Couldn't put it down!,"This is the first time I have read Noah Gordon and I was really surprised to see some of the lesser reviews of this book. It grabbed me from the very beginning and wouldn't me go. If this book is not up to par with the first two of the trilogy, I can't wait to read them."
2,So much potential for a really great sequel wasted.,"I own and have reread Physician and Shaman several times, and fully expected another great read in the series. Instead, all the right ingredients appeared to suborn themselves to a politically correct agenda. Each of the first two novels left me with a profound feeling of satisfaction and respect for a wonderful tale, well told. Matters of Choice seems to go nowhere, portraying episodes in sequence while merely reflecting current social unrest and dwindling off to a very unsatisfactory conclusion."
2,A Boring End To The Tryology,I don't know what happened with Mr. Noah Gordon... The Physician and Shaman were two fantastic books and the tryology of Cole's family deserved a better final book.... Choices is boring...
